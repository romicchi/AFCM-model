How would buildings look? How would acceptable clothing or style\nof dress be de\u0000ned? Could any kind of visual communication exist at all? It\u2019s a provocative question that quickly necessitates de\u0000ning the\nboundaries of what does and does not constitute art. This mirrors the complexity of engaging in the ongoing de\u0000nition of art.\nArt is studied because \u201cit is among the highest expressions of culture, embodying its ideals and aspirations, challenging its assumptions and\nbeliefs, and creating new visions and possibilities for it to pursue\u201d (Sayre, XVI). When we discuss contemporary art, we are typically referring to\nthe practice of \u0000ne art, but prior to the Renaissance art was de\u0000ned within the realm of functional crafts, such as goldsmithing. The idea of\nautonomous art, or art for art\u2019s sake, developed later, over many eras.\nStudying art leads to a greater understanding of our own cultural values and other cultures. When colonizing forces of Europeans encountered\nAfrican wood sculptural nkisi \u0000gures, primarily in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they considered them to be evidence of\nidolatry and witchcraft or opposition to the colonizing forces (Sayre 11\u201312). The \u0000gures were often pierced with nails as a symbolic gesture to\ninitiate a desired goal, like creating a contract or agreement between individuals or groups. The invading Europeans often destroyed the nkisi\n\u0000gures, which were sacred objects to the Congo people.\nVisit this link to see an example of a nkisi sculpture.\nThe material covered in this section will help you understand how we arrived at our contemporary understanding of art and how to begin\nengaging in the ongoing de\u0000nition and discussion of art.\nOK, let's get started!\nWork Cited\nSayre, Henry.
