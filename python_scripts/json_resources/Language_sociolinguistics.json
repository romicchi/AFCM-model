{"text":"Introduction 1\n1 Introduction\nAny discussion of the relationship between language and society, or of the vari-\nous functions of language in society, should begin with some attempt to define\neach of these terms. Let us say that a society is any group of people who are\ndrawn together for a certain purpose or purposes. By such a definition \u2018society\u2019\nbecomes a very comprehensive concept, but we will soon see how useful such\na comprehensive view is because of the very different kinds of societies we must\nconsider in the course of the various discussions that follow. We may attempt\nan equally comprehensive definition of language: a language is what the mem-\nbers of a particular society speak. However, as we will see, speech in almost\nany society can take many very different forms, and just what forms we should\nchoose to discuss when we attempt to describe the language of a society may\nprove to be a contentious matter. Sometimes too a society may be plurilingual;\nthat is, many speakers may use more than one language, however we define\nlanguage. We should also note that our definitions of language and society are\nnot independent: the definition of language includes in it a reference to society.\nI will return to this matter from time to time.\nKnowledge of Language\nWhen two or more people communicate with each other in speech, we can call\nthe system of communication that they employ a code. In most cases that code\nwill be something we may also want to call a language. We should also note that\ntwo speakers who are bilingual, that is, who have access to two codes, and who\nfor one reason or another shift back and forth between the two languages as\nthey converse by code-switching (see chapter 4) are actually using a third code,\none which draws on those two languages. The system (or the grammar, to usea\nwell-known technical term) is something that each speaker \u2018knows,\u2019 but twovery\nimportant issues for linguists are just what that knowledge is knowledge of and\nhow it may best be characterized.\nIn practice, linguists do not find it at all easy to write grammars because the\nknowledge that people have of the languages they speak is extremely hard to\ndescribe. It is certainly something different from, and is much more considerable\nAITC01 1 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 2 Introduction\nthan, the kinds of knowledge we see described in most of the grammars we find\non library shelves, no matter how good those grammars may be. Anyone who\nknows a language knows much more about that language than is contained in\nany grammar book that attempts to describe the language. What is also inter-\nesting is that this knowledge is both something which every individual who\nspeaks the language possesses (since we must assume that each individual knows\nthe grammar of his or her language by the simple reason that he or she readily\nuses that language) and also some kind of shared knowledge, that is, knowledge\npossessed by all those who speak the language. It is also possible to talk about\n\u2018dead\u2019 languages, e.g., Latin or Sanskrit. However, in such cases we should note\nthat it is the speakers who are dead, not the languages themselves, for these may\nstill exist, at least in part. We may even be tempted to claim an existence for\nEnglish, French, or Swahili independent of the existence of those who speak\nthese languages.\nToday, most linguists agree that the knowledge speakers have of the language\nor languages they speak is knowledge of something quite abstract. It is a know-\nledge of rules and principles and of the ways of saying and doing things with\nsounds, words, and sentences, rather than just knowledge of specific sounds,\nwords, and sentences. It is knowing what is in the language and what is not; it\nis knowing the possibilities the language offers and what is impossible. Thisknow-\nledge explains how it is we can understand sentences we have not heard before\nand reject others as being ungrammatical, in the sense of not being possible in\nthe language. Communication among people who speak the same language is\npossible because they share such knowledge, although how it is shared \u2013 or even\nhow it is acquired \u2013 is not well understood. Certainly, psychological and social\nfactors are important, and genetic ones too. Language is a communalpossession,\nalthough admittedly an abstract one. Individuals have access to it and constantly\nshow that they do so by using it properly. As we will see, a wide range of skills\nand activities is subsumed under this concept of \u2018proper use.\u2019\nConfronted with the task of trying to describe the grammar of a language\nlike English, many linguists follow the approach which is associated with\nChomsky, undoubtedly the most influential figure in late twentieth-century linguis-\ntics. Chomsky has argued on many occasions that, in order to make meaningful\ndiscoveries about language, linguists must try to distinguish between what is\nimportant and what is unimportant about language and linguistic behavior. The\nimportant matters, sometimes referred to as language universals, concern the\nlearnability of all languages, the characteristics they share, and the rules and\nprinciples that speakers apparently follow in constructing and interpreting sen-\ntences; the less important matters have to do with how individual speakers use\nspecific utterances in a variety of ways as they find themselves in this situation\nor that.\nChomsky has also distinguished between what he has called competence\nand performance. He claims that it is the linguist\u2019s task to characterize what\nspeakers know about their language, i.e., their competence, not what they do\nwith their language, i.e., their performance. The best-known characterization of\nthis distinction comes from Chomsky himself (1965, pp. 3\u20134) in words which\nhave been extensively quoted:\nAITC01 2 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 3\nLinguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal speaker\u2013listener, in a com-\npletely homogeneous speech-community, who knows its language perfectly and is\nunaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions as memory limitations, dis-\ntractions, shifts of attention and interest, and errors (random or characteristic) in\napplying his knowledge of the language in actual performance. This seems to me\nto have been the position of the founders of modern general linguistics, and no\ncogent reason for modifying it has been offered. To study actual linguistic perform-\nance, we must consider the interaction of a variety of factors, of which the under-\nlying competence of the speaker\u2013hearer is only one. In this respect, study of language\nis no different from empirical investigation of other complex phenomena.\nFrom time to time we will return to this distinction between competence and\nperformance. However, the knowledge we will seek to explain involves more\nthan knowledge of the grammar of the language for it will become apparent that\nspeakers know, or are in agreement about, more than that. Moreover, in their\nperformance they behave systematically: their actions are not random; there is\norder. Knowing a language also means knowing how to use that language since\nspeakers know not only how to form sentences but also how to use them\nappropriately. There is therefore another kind of competence, sometimes called\ncommunicative competence, and the social aspects of that competence will be\nour concern here.\nDiscussion\n1. Hymes (1964b, p. 16) presents the following two instances of behavior\nwhich the participants, speakers of Ojibwa, an American Indian language,\ndescribe as language behavior:\nAn informant told me that many years before he was sitting in a tent one\nafternoon during a storm, together with an old man and his wife. There was\none clap of thunder after another. Suddenly the old man turned to his wife and\nasked, \u2018Did you hear what was said?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 she replied, \u2018I didn\u2019t catch it.\u2019 My\ninformant, an acculturated Indian, told me he did not at first know what the\nold man and his wife referred to. It was, of course, the thunder. The old man\nthought that one of the Thunder Birds had said something to him. He wasreact-\ning to this sound in the same way as he would respond to a human being,whose\nwords he did not understand. The casualness of the remark and even thetrivial\ncharacter of the anecdote demonstrate the psychological depth of the \u2018social\nrelations\u2019 with other-than-human beings that becomes explicit in the behavior\nof the Ojibwa as a consequence of the cognitive \u2018set\u2019 induced by their culture.\nA white trader, digging in his potato patch, unearthed a large stone similar\nto the one just referred to. He sent for John Duck, an Indian who was the\nleader of the w\u00e1bano, a contemporary ceremony that is held in a structure\nsomething like that used for the Midewiwin (a major ceremony during which\nstones occasionally had animate properties such as movement and opening of\na mouth). The trader called his attention to the stone, saying that it must\nbelong to his pavilion. John Duck did not seem pleased at this. He bent down\nand spoke to the boulder in a low voice, inquiring whether it had ever been\nin his pavilion. According to John the stone replied in the negative.\nAITC01 3 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 4 Introduction\nIt is obvious that John Duck spontaneously structured the situation in terms\nthat are intelligible within the context of Ojibwa language and culture....I\nregret that my field notes contain no information about the use of direct\nverbal address in the other cases mentioned (movement of stone, opening of\na mouth). But it may well have taken place. In the anecdote describing John\nDuck\u2019s behavior, however, his use of speech as a mode of communicationraises\nthe animate status of the boulder to the level of social interaction common to\nhuman beings. Simply as a matter of observation we can say that the stone\nwas treated as if it were a \u2018person,\u2019 not a \u2018thing,\u2019 without inferring that objects\nof this class are, for the Ojibwa, necessarily conceptualized as persons.\nHymes argues that \u2018in general, no phenomenon can be defined in advanceas\nnever to be counted as constituting a message.\u2019 How does this observation\napply to the above examples? Can you think of possible examples drawnfrom\nyour own experience? Note that a basic assumption here is that \u2018messages,\u2019\nwhatever they are, require a \u2018language.\u2019 Should every \u2018language\u2019 in whichyou\ncan send \u2018messages\u2019 be of equal interest to us as sociolinguists, e.g., the \u2018lan-\nguage\u2019 of flowers, semaphore signaling, dress codes, and road signs? If not,\nwhat principles should guide us in an attempt to constrain our interests?And\nhow do you view the \u2018languages\u2019 of logic, mathematics, and computers?\n2. What obstacles do you see in an attempt to define English as a language\nwhen you consider that such a definition must cover all of the following\n(and much more): both Cockney and Jamaican English; the speech of two-\nyear-olds; fast colloquial speech; the language of formal written documents\nsuch as real estate transfers; formulaic expressions such as How do you do?\nand It never rains but it pours; completely novel sentences, i.e., sentences\nyou have not heard or seen before (e.g., just about any sentence in this\nbook); and slips of the tongue, e.g., queer dean for dear Queen? What kind\nof abilities must you yourself have in order even to consider attempting such\na task?\nVariation\nThe competence\u2013performance distinction just mentioned is one that holds intri-\nguing possibilities for work in linguistics, but it is one that has also proved to\nbe quite troublesome, particularly when much of the variety we experiencewithin\nlanguage is labeled \u2018performance\u2019 and then put to one side by those who con-\nsider \u2018competence\u2019 to be the only valid concern of linguists. The language we use\nin everyday living is remarkably varied. Some investigators believe that this\nvariety throws up serious obstacles to all attempts to demonstrate that each\nlanguage is truly a homogeneous entity, and that it is possible to write a com-\nplete grammar for a language which makes use of categorical rules, i.e., rules\nwhich specify exactly what is \u2013 and therefore what is not \u2013 possible in the\nlanguage. Everywhere we turn we seem to find at least a new wrinkle or a small\ninconsistency with regard to any rule we might propose. When we look closely\nAITC01 4 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 5\nat any language, we will discover time and time again that there is considerable\ninternal variation and that speakers make constant use of the many different\npossibilities offered to them. No one speaks the same way all the time and\npeople constantly exploit the nuances of the languages they speak for a wide\nvariety of purposes. The consequence is a kind of paradox: while many linguists\nwould like to view any language as a homogeneous entity and each speaker of\nthat language as controlling only a single style, so that they can make the\nstrongest possible theoretical generalizations, in actual fact that language will\nexhibit considerable internal variation, and single-style speakers will not be\nfound (or, if found, will appear to be quite \u2018abnormal\u2019 in that respect, if in no\nother!).\nA recognition of variation implies that we must recognize that a language is\nnot just some kind of abstract object of study. It is also something that people\nuse. Can we really set aside, at any point in our study of language, this fact of\nuse? It is not surprising therefore that a recurring issue in linguistics in recent\nyears has been the possible value of a linguistics that deliberately separates itself\nfrom any concern with the use, and the users, of language. Following Chomsky\u2019s\nexample, many linguists have argued that we should not study a language in\nuse, or even how the language is learned, without first acquiring an adequate\nknowledge of what language itself is. In this view, linguistic investigations should\nfocus on developing this latter knowledge. The linguist\u2019s task should be to write\ngrammars that will help us develop our understanding of language: what it is,\nhow it is learnable, and what it tells us about the human mind. This kind of\nlinguistics is sometimes referred to as \u2018theoretical linguistics\u2019 and it has claimed\na privileged position for itself within the overall discipline of linguistics. Inves-\ntigations of language use have little to offer us in such a view.\nMany sociolinguists have disagreed, arguing that an asocial linguistics is scarcely\nworthwhile and that meaningful insights into language can be gained only if\nsuch matters as use and variation are included as part of the data which must\nbe explained in a comprehensive theory of language; such a theory of language\nmust have something to say about the uses of language. This is the view I will\nadopt here. However, while doing so, from time to time I will voice some\nskepticism about the claims of other investigators that we should pursue certain\nideological ends in investigating such use (see chapters 13\u201315). Detachment and\nobjectivity are essential requirements of serious scientific inquiry.\nWe will see that there is considerable variation in the speech of any one indi-\nvidual, but there are also definite bounds to that variation: no individual is free\nto do just exactly what he or she pleases so far as language is concerned. You\ncannot pronounce words any way you please, inflect or not inflect words such\nas nouns and verbs arbitrarily, or make drastic alterations in word order in sen-\ntences as the mood suits you. If you do any or all of these things, the results\nwill be unacceptable, even gibberish. The variation you are permitted has limits\nand these limits can be described with considerable accuracy. Individuals know\nthe various limits (or norms), and that knowledge is both very precise and at\nthe same time almost entirely unconscious. It is also difficult to explain how\nindividual speakers acquire knowledge of these norms of linguistic behavior, for\nthey appear to be much more subtle than the norms that apply to such matters\nAITC01 5 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 6 Introduction\nas social behavior, dress, and table manners. This is another issue to which we\nwill return from time to time. Our task will be one of trying to specify the\nnorms of linguistic behavior that exist in particular groups and then trying to\naccount for individual behavior in terms of these norms. This task is particularly\ninteresting because most people have no conscious awareness that we canaccount\nfor much of their linguistic behavior in this way.\nPeople have also learned such behavior. We must be concerned with that\nlearning. Why does speaker X behave this way but speaker Y behave that way?\nTo answer that question we must look at such issues as identity, group mem-\nbership, power, and socialization.\nEach of us has an identity (or, perhaps more accurately, a set of identities).\nThat identity has been constructed from interaction with others and it is the\nsense of self each of us has achieved, the result of our socialization, i.e., our\nexperiences with the outside world as we have dealt with that world in all its\ncomplexity. Consequently, any of many factors might have affected it: race,\nethnicity, gender, religion, occupation, physical location, social class, kinship,\nleisure activities, etc. Identity is created in dealing with such factors and in\ndealing with members of groups for whom these factors are their identifying\ncharacteristics. An identity may also change for identities can sometimes be\nquite malleable, but, of course, it may also stay fixed if change is not allowed\nor if a fixed identity is to be maintained at all costs.\nIdentity is very important: individual identity and group identity. It will be a\nrecurrent theme in the pages that follow. Much of what we find in linguistic\nbehavior will be explicable in terms of people seeking to negotiate, realize, or\neven reject identities through the use of language. In fact, as we will see,language\nis a profound indicator of identity, more potent by far than cultural artifacts\nsuch as dress, food choices, and table manners.\nGroups, too, have identities, their ways of achieving a sense of solidarity\namong members, so we will be interested in the linguistic characteristics of both\nindividuals and groups. Concepts such as \u2018community\u2019 (see chapter 5), \u2018social\nnetwork\u2019 (see pp. 129\u201330), and \u2018community of practice\u2019 (see p. 127) will be\nfound in the pages that follow. These are useful in referring to groups of various\nkinds, for it is within groups that individuals form relationships or reject sucha\npossibility. However, groups, like individuals, are complex entities so we must\nnever forget that any reference made in the following pages to \u2018middle class,\u2019\n\u2018women,\u2019 \u2018speakers of Haitian Creole,\u2019 \u2018teenagers,\u2019 etc. in reality subsumes a\nvariety of individual identities each in its own way just as complex as the whole.\nFinally, in all the above we must recognize that \u2018power\u2019 plays a significant role\nin everything that happens. Some forces in society are stronger than others and\nproduce real effects, among them linguistic effects that have consequences for\nthe lives we live. Bourdieu (1991) conceives of languages as symbolic market-\nplaces in which some people have more control of the goods than others because\ncertain languages or varieties have been endowed with more symbolic power\nthan others and have therefore been given a greater value, e.g., standard lan-\nguages, certain accents, a particular gendered style of speaking, a specific type\nof discourse. Power and some of the various responses to it will also find\nfrequent mention in the pages that follow.\nAITC01 6 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 7\nDiscussion\n1. I have said that languages contain a great deal of variety. What evidence can\nyou cite to show some of the variety? Consider, for example, how many\ndifferent ways you can ask someone to open a window or seek permission\nto open the window yourself because the room you are in is too warm.\nHow many ways can you pronounce variants of and, have, do, of, and for?\nWhen might Did you eat yet? sound like Jeechet? What did you do with the\nwords and sounds? Do you speak the same way to a younger sibling at\nhome over the breakfast table as you would to a distinguished public figure\nyou meet at a ceremonial dinner? If you do not, and it is almost certain that\nyou do not, what are the differences in the linguistic choices you make?\nWhy do you make them?\n2. An individual can use language in a variety of ways and for many different\npurposes. What might cause a speaker to say each of the following? When\nwould each be quite inappropriate?\na. Do you think it\u2019s cold in here?\nb. The airport, as fast as you can.\nc. I do.\nd. I leave my house to my son George.\ne. Do you love me?\nf. How strange!\ng. Can we have some silence at the back?\nh. What a beautiful dress!\ni. Cheers!\nj. Will you marry me?\nk. Do you come here often?\nl. Keep to the right, please.\nm. Damn!\nn. You don\u2019t love me any more.\nDo you know of any grammar book that tells you when to use (or not to\nuse) each of the above? Would you describe your knowledge of when to\nuse (or not to use) each as a matter of competence or of performance? (In\nthinking about this you might consult just about any discussion of Chomsky\u2019s\nwork on linguistic theory.)\n3. Do you always agree with people you know about the \u2018correct\u2019 choice\nto make of certain linguistic forms? What do you, and they, regard as the\ncorrect completions of the tag questions found in the following examples?\n(The first is done for you.)\na. He\u2019s ready, isn\u2019t he?\nb.

Few people know that, _______________________________________ ?\ni. The baby cried, ______________________________________________ ?\nj. Either John or Mary did it, ___________________________________ ?\nk. Each of us is going to go, ____________________________________ ?\nWhat kinds of difficulties did you find in completing this task? What kinds\nof agreements and disagreements do you find when you compare your\nresponses to those of others? What do the standard grammars have to say\nabout correctness here? How would you advise an adult learning English as\na foreign language concerning this particular problem?\n4. Describe some aspects of your own speech which show how it varies from\nthe speech of certain other people you know. Do you pronounce words\ndifferently, use different word forms, choose different words, or use differ-\nent grammatical structures? How do you view, i.e., judge, the speech of\nthose who speak differently from you?\n5. Hudson (1996, p. 12) says that we may be impressed by the amount of\nagreement that is often found among speakers. This agreement goes well\nbeyond what is needed for efficient communication. He particularly points\nout the conformity we exhibit in using irregular forms, e.g., went for the\npast tense of go, men as the plural of man, and best as the superlative of\ngood. This irregular morphology is somewhat inefficient; all it shows is our\nconformity to rules established by others. How conformist do you consider\nyourself to be so far as language is concerned? What \u2018rules\u2019 do you obey?\nWhen do you \u2018flout the rules,\u2019 if you ever do?\nScientific Investigation\nThe scientific study of language, its uses, and the linguistic norms that people\nobserve poses a number of problems. Such a study must go a long way beyond\nmerely devising schemes for classifying the various bits and pieces of linguistic\ndata you might happen to observe. That would be a rather uninteresting activity,\na kind of butterfly collecting. A more profound kind of theorizing is called for:\nsome attempt to arrive at an understanding of the general principles of organ-\nization that surely must exist in both language and the uses of language. It is\njust such an attempt that led Saussure (1959) to distinguish between langue\n(group knowledge of language) and parole (individual use of language); Bloomfield\n(1933) to stress the importance of contrastive distribution (since pin and bin are\ndifferent words in English, \/p\/ and \/b\/ must be contrastive units in the structure\nof English); Pike (1967) to distinguish between emic and etic features inlanguage\n(\/p\/ and \/b\/ are contrastive, therefore emic, units, but the two pronunciations of\np in pin and spin are not contrastive, therefore etic); and Sapir (1921) and,much\nlater, Chomsky (1965) to stress the distinction between the \u2018surface\u2019characteristics\nAITC01 8 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 9\nof utterances and the \u2018deep\u2019 realities of linguistic form behind these surface\ncharacteristics. A major current linguistic concern is with matters such aslanguage\nuniversals, i.e., the essential properties and various typologies of languages (see\nComrie, 1989, and Cook and Newson, 1996), the factors that make languages\nlearnable by humans but not by non-humans (see Pinker, 1994), and the con-\nditions that govern such matters as linguistic change (see Labov, 1994, and\nMcMahon, 1994).\nThere is not just one way to do linguistics, although it is true to say that some\nlinguists occasionally behave as though their way is the only way. It is actually\nquite possible for two linguists to adopt radically different approaches to both\nlanguage and linguistic theorizing in their work while still doing something that\nmany consider to be genuine linguistics. Perhaps nowhere can such differencesof\napproach be better observed than in attempts to study the relationship oflanguage\nto society. Such attempts cover a very wide range of issues and reveal thediversity\nof approaches: different theories about what language is; different views of what\nconstitute the data that are relevant to a specific issue; different formulations of\nresearch problems; different conceptions of what are \u2018good\u2019 answers, the \u2018signi-\nficance\u2019 or \u2018interest\u2019 of certain findings, and the generalizability of conclusions;\nand different interpretations of both the theoretical and \u2018real-world\u2019 consequences\nof particular pieces of research, i.e., what they tell us about the nature of lan-\nguage or indicate we might do to change or improve the human condition.\nDiscussion\n1. Find out what you can about Saussure\u2019s distinction between langue and\nparole and about Pike\u2019s etic\u2013emic distinction. How might these distinctions\nrelate to any study of language use in society?\n2. Bloomfield\u2019s views on contrastive distribution are very important. Be sure\nyou know what is meant by the concept of \u2018contrast\u2019 in linguistics. You\nmight test out your knowledge of the concept by trying to find out how\nmany contrastive consonant and vowel sounds you have in the variety of\nEnglish you speak. If you find the number of consonant sounds to be any\nother than 24 and the number of vowel sounds to be far different from 14,\nyou may be on the wrong track.\nLanguage and Society\nIn the following chapters we will look at many ways in which language and\nsociety are related. The possible relationships have long intrigued investigators.\nIndeed, if we look back at the history of linguistics it is rare to find investiga-\ntions of any language which are entirely cut off from concurrent investigations\nof the history of that language, or of its regional and\/or social distributions, or\nof its relationship to objects, ideas, events, and actual speakers and listeners in\nAITC01 9 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 10 Introduction\nthe \u2018real\u2019 world. That is one of the reasons why a number of linguists have\nfound Chomsky\u2019s asocial view of linguistic theorizing to be a rather sterile type\nof activity, since it explicitly rejects any concern for the relationship between a\nlanguage and those who use it.\nWe must acknowledge that a language is essentially a set of items, what\nHudson (1996, p. 21) calls \u2018linguistic items,\u2019 such entities as sounds, words,\ngrammatical structures, and so on. It is these items, their status, and their\narrangements that language theorists such as Chomsky concern themselves\nwith. On the other hand, social theorists, particularly sociologists, attempt to\nunderstand how societies are structured and how people manage to livetogether.\nTo do so, they use such concepts as \u2018identity,\u2019 \u2018power,\u2019 \u2018class,\u2019 \u2018status,\u2019 \u2018solidar-\nity,\u2019 \u2018accommodation,\u2019 \u2018face,\u2019 \u2018gender,\u2019 \u2018politeness,\u2019 etc. A major concern of this\nbook is to examine possible relationships between \u2018linguistic items\u2019 on the one\nhand and concepts such as \u2018power,\u2019 \u2018solidarity,\u2019 etc. on the other. We should note\nthat in doing so we are trying to relate two different kinds of entities in order\nto see what light they throw on each other. That is not an easy task. Linguistic\nitems are difficult to define. Try, for example, to define exactly what linguistic\nitems such as sounds, syllables, words, and sentences are. Then try to define\nprecisely what you understand by such concepts as \u2018social class,\u2019 \u2018solidarity,\u2019\n\u2018identity,\u2019 \u2018face,\u2019 and \u2018politeness.\u2019 Finally, try to relate the two sets of definitions\nwithin some kind of theory so as to draw conclusions about how items in these\ntwo very different classes relate to each other. Do all this while keeping in mind\nthat languages and societies are constantly changing. The difficulties we con-\nfront are both legion and profound.\nThere are several possible relationships between language and society. One is\nthat social structure may either influence or determine linguistic structureand\/or\nbehavior. Certain evidence may be adduced to support this view: the age-grading\nphenomenon whereby young children speak differently from older children and,\nin turn, children speak differently from mature adults; studies which show that\nthe varieties of language that speakers use reflect such matters as their regional,\nsocial, or ethnic origin and possibly even their gender; and other studies which\nshow that particular ways of speaking, choices of words, and even rules for\nconversing are in fact highly determined by certain social requirements.\nA second possible relationship is directly opposed to the first: linguistic struc-\nture and\/or behavior may either influence or determine social structure. This is\nthe view that is behind the Whorfian hypothesis (see chapter 9), the claims of\nBernstein (see chapter 14), and many of those who argue that languages rather\nthan speakers of these languages can be \u2018sexist\u2019 (see chapter 13). A third possible\nrelationship is that the influence is bi-directional: language and society may\ninfluence each other. One variant of this approach is that this influence is dia-\nlectical in nature, a Marxist view put forward by Dittmar (1976), who argues\n(p. 238) that \u2018speech behaviour and social behaviour are in a state of constant\ninteraction\u2019 and that \u2018material living conditions\u2019 are an important factor in the\nrelationship.\nA fourth possibility is to assume that there is no relationship at all between\nlinguistic structure and social structure and that each is independent of the\nother. A variant of this possibility would be to say that, although there might\nAITC01 10 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 11\nbe some such relationship, present attempts to characterize it are essentially\npremature, given what we know about both language and society. Actually, this\nvariant view appears to be the one that Chomsky himself holds: he prefers to\ndevelop an asocial linguistics as a preliminary to any other kind of linguistics,\nsuch an asocial approach being, in his view, logically prior.\nWe must therefore be prepared to look into various aspects of the possible\nrelationships between language and society. It will be quite obvious from doing\nso that correlational studies must form a significant part of sociolinguistic work.\nGumperz (1971, p. 223) has observed that sociolinguistics is an attempt to find\ncorrelations between social structure and linguistic structure and to observe any\nchanges that occur. Chambers (2002, p. 3) is even more direct: \u2018Sociolinguistics\nis the study of the social uses of language, and the most productive studies in\nthe four decades of sociolinguistic research have emanated from determining the\nsocial evaluation of linguistic variants. These are also the areas most susceptible\nto scientific methods such as hypothesis-formation, logical inference, and statis-\ntical testing.\u2019 However, as Gumperz and others have been quick to indicate, such\nstudies do not exhaust sociolinguistic investigation, nor do they always prove to\nbe as enlightening as one might hope. It is a well-known fact that a correlation\nshows only a relationship between two variables; it does not show ultimate\ncausation. To find that X and Y are related is not necessarily to discover that\nX causes Y (or Y causes X), for it is also quite possible that some third factor,\nZ, may cause both X and Y (or even that some far more subtle combination of\nfactors is involved). We must always exercise caution when we attempt to draw\nconclusions from such relationships.\nA worthwhile sociolinguistics, however, must be something more than just a\nsimple mixing of linguistics and sociology which takes concepts and findings\nfrom the two disciplines and attempts to relate them in simple ways. It certainly\nmust go beyond Horvath\u2019s view (1998, p. 448) that sociolinguists should just\npick and choose freely from sociology: \u2018What my kind of sociolinguists do is go\nperiodically to sociology and find \u201csocial networks\u201d or \u201cthe linguistic market\nplace\u201d...and we find [these concepts] terribly useful in understanding the\npatterns that emerge from our data. However, we are not engaged in the soci-\nologists\u2019 struggles over the importance of social networks vis-\u00e0-vis other ways\nof dealing with the structure of society and may remain blissfully unaware of\nwhether or not these models have become contentious within the home discip-\nline.\u2019 A serious scientific approach is incompatible with \u2018blissful unawareness\u2019\nin an essential part of its underpinnings. Hymes (1974, p. 76) has pointed out\nthat even a mechanical amalgamation of standard linguistics and standard\nsociology is not likely to suffice in that in adding a speechless sociology to a\nsociology-free linguistics we may miss what is important in the relationship\nbetween language and society. Specific points of connection between language\nand society must be discovered, and these must be related within theories that\nthrow light on how linguistic and social structures interact.\nHolmes (1992, p. 16) says that \u2018the sociolinguist\u2019s aim is to move towards a\ntheory which provides a motivated account of the way language is used in a\ncommunity, and of the choices people make when they use language.\u2019 Forexample,\nwhen we observe how varied language use is we must search for the causes.\nAITC01 11 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 12 Introduction\n\u2018Upon observing variability, we seek its social correlates. What is the purpose of\nthe variation? How is it evaluated in the community? What do its variants\nsymbolize?\u2019 (Chambers, 2003, p. 226). For Chambers these questions \u2018are the\ncentral questions of sociolinguistics.\u2019 Chambers is not alone in holding such\nviews. Others too believe that sociolinguistics is the study of language variation\nand that the purpose of such study is to find out what variation tells us about\nlanguage and speakers\u2019 \u2018knowledge\u2019 of language, in this case their unconscious\nknowledge of subtle linguistic differences.\nWe will also see that there is some opposition to this idea that sociolinguistic\ninvestigations should be confined to fairly straightforward correlational studiesof\nthis kind. Critics such as Cameron (1997) claim that these studies do notprovide\nvery satisfactory explanations for linguistic behavior because of inadequacieswith\nsocial theory \u2013 sometimes there is none at all \u2013 and failure to appreciate the\ndifficulties in using social concepts. Any conclusions are likely to be suspect.What\nis needed, according to Cameron (p. 62), is more social engagement so thatsocio-\nlinguistics would \u2018deal with such matters as the production and reproduction\nof linguistic norms by institutions and socializing practices; how these norms are\napprehended, accepted, resisted and subverted by individual actors and what\ntheir relation is to the construction of identity.\u2019 Milroy (2001, pp. 554\u20135) makes\na somewhat similar claim in discussing the processes of standardization and\nchange: \u2018Social patterns are adduced only in so far as they may elucidate pat-\nterns of language by exhibiting co-variation with linguistic variables...and as\nlong as internal analyses are quite strongly biased in favor of linguistic, rather\nthan social, phenomena, the quantitative paradigm will be to that extent\nimpeded in its attempts to explain the social \u201clife\u201d of language and the social\norigins of language change.\u2019 I have already mentioned this idea of necessary\nsocial engagement and I will return to it later. However, one point is clear in the\nabove disagreement: sociolinguistics, whatever it is, is about asking important\nquestions concerning the relationship of language to society. In the pages that\nfollow I will try to show you some of those questions.\nDiscussion\n1. To convince yourself that there are some real issues here with regard to the\npossible relationships between language and society, consider your responses\nto the following questions and compare them with those of others.\na. Does an Inuit \u2018see\u2019 a snowscape differently from a native of Chad\nvisiting the cold north for the first time because the Inuit must be using\na language developed to deal with the surrounding snowscape?\nb. If men and women speak differently, is it because the common language\nthey share has a gender bias, because boys and girls are brought up\ndifferently, or because part of \u2018gender marking\u2019 is the linguistic choices\none can \u2013 indeed, must \u2013 make?\nc. Is language just another cultural artifact, like property, possessions, or\nmoney, which is used for the expression of power and\/or as a medium\nof exchange?\nAITC01 12 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 13\nd. If language is an essential human attribute and humans are necessarily\nsocial beings, what problems and paradoxes do you see for theoretical\nwork in sociolinguistics if the latter is to grapple with the relationships\nbetween linguistic and social factors?\n2. One aspect of the power of professionals is said to be the way they\nare able to use language to control others. How do physicians, psychiatrists,\nlawyers, social workers, teachers, priests, police officers, etc. use language\nto control others? Does this same power principle apply to parents (in\nrelation to children), men (in relation to women), upper social classes (in\nrelation to lower social classes), speakers of standard languages (in relation\nto speakers of nonstandard varieties of those languages), and so on?\nSociolinguistics and the Sociology of Language\nSome investigators have found it appropriate to try to introduce a distinction\nbetween sociolinguistics or micro-sociolinguistics and the sociology of language\nor macro-sociolinguistics. In this distinction, sociolinguistics is concerned with\ninvestigating the relationships between language and society with the goal being\na better understanding of the structure of language and of how languages func-\ntion in communication; the equivalent goal in the sociology of language is trying\nto discover how social structure can be better understood through the study of\nlanguage, e.g., how certain linguistic features serve to characterize particular\nsocial arrangements. Hudson (1996, p. 4) has described the difference as fol-\nlows: sociolinguistics is \u2018the study of language in relation to society,\u2019 whereas the\nsociology of language is \u2018the study of society in relation to language.\u2019 In other\nwords, in sociolinguistics we study language and society in order to find out\nas much as we can about what kind of thing language is, and in the sociology\nof language we reverse the direction of our interest. Using the alternative terms\ngiven above, Coulmas (1997, p. 2) says that \u2018micro-sociolingustics investigates\nhow social structure influences the way people talk and how language varieties\nand patterns of use correlate with social attributes such as class, sex, and age.\nMacro-sociolinguistics, on the other hand, studies what societies do with their\nlanguages, that is, attitudes and attachments that account for the functional\ndistribution of speech forms in society, language shift, maintenance, and replace-\nment, the delimitation and interaction of speech communities.\u2019\nThe view I will take here is that both sociolinguistics and the sociology of\nlanguage require a systematic study of language and society if they are to be\nsuccessful. Moreover, a sociolinguistics that deliberately refrains from drawing\nconclusions about society seems to be unnecessarily restrictive, just as restrictive\nindeed as a sociology of language that deliberately ignores discoveries about\nlanguage made in the course of sociological research. So while it is possible to\ndo either kind of work to the exclusion of the other, I will be concerned with\nlooking at both kinds. My own views are essentially in agreement with those of\nCoulmas (1997, p. 3), expressed as follows:\nAITC01 13 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 14 Introduction\nThere is no sharp dividing line between the two, but a large area of common\nconcern. Although sociolinguistic research centers about a number of different key\nissues, any rigid micro\u2013macro compartmentalization seems quite contrived and\nunnecessary in the present state of knowledge about the complex interrelationships\nbetween linguistic and social structures. Contributions to a better understanding of\nlanguage as a necessary condition and product of social life will continue to come\nfrom both quarters.\nConsequently, I will not attempt to make the kinds of distinctions found in\nTrudgill (1978). He tries to differentiate those studies that he considers to be\nclearly sociolinguistic in nature from those that clearly are not, for, as he says,\n\u2018while everybody would agree that sociolinguistics has something to do with\nlanguage and society, it is clearly also not concerned with everything that could\nbe considered \u201clanguage and society\u201d.\u2019 The problem, therefore, lies in the draw-\ning of the line between language and society and sociolinguistics. Different\nscholars draw the line in different places (p. 1). Trudgill argues that certain types\nof language studies are almost entirely sociological in their objectives and seem\nto fall outside even the sociology of language. Included in this category areethno-\nmethodological studies (see chapter 10) and work by such people as Bernstein\n(see chapter 14). For Trudgill, such work is definitely not sociolinguistics,however\ndefined, since it apparently has no linguistic objectives.\nAccording to Trudgill, certain kinds of work combine insights from sociology\nand linguistics. Examples of such work are attempts to deal with the structure\nof discourse and conversation (see chapter 12), speech acts (see chapter 12),\nstudies in the ethnography of speaking (see chapter 10), investigations of such\nmatters as kinship systems (see chapter 9), studies in the sociology of language,\ne.g., bilingualism, code-switching, and diglossia (see particularly chapter 4), and\ncertain \u2018practical\u2019 concerns such as various aspects of teaching and language\nbehavior in classrooms. While Trudgill considers all such topics to be genuinely\nsociolinguistic, he prefers, however, to use that term in a rather different and\nsomewhat narrower sense. Elsewhere (1995, p. 21), he says that such concerns\nare perhaps better subsumed under anthropological linguistics, geolinguistics,\nthe social psychology of language, and so on.\nFor Trudgill there is still another category of studies in which investigators\nshow a concern for both linguistic and social matters. This category consists of\nstudies which have a linguistic intent. \u2018Studies of this type are based on empir-\nical work on language as it is spoken in its social context, and are intended\nto answer questions and deal with topics of central interest to linguists\u2019 (1978,\np. 11). These studies are just another way of doing linguistics. Included in this\ncategory are studies of variation and linguistic change (see chapters 6\u20138), and\nthe seminal figure is Labov. According to Trudgill, Labov has addressed himself\nto issues such as the relationship between language and social class, with his\nmain objective not to learn more about a particular society or to examine\ncorrelations between linguistic and social phenomena, but to learn more about\nlanguage and to investigate topics such as the mechanisms of linguistic change,\nthe nature of linguistic variability, and the structure of linguistic systems. Trudgill\u2019s\nview is that \u2018all work in this category is aimed ultimately at improving linguistic\nAITC01 14 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 15\ntheory and at developing our understanding of the nature of language\u2019 (1978,\np. 11). For him this is genuine sociolinguistics. Chambers (2002, 2003) voices\na similar view and Downes (1998, p. 9) echoes it: \u2018sociolinguistics is that branch\nof linguistics which studies just those properties of language and languages\nwhich require reference to social, including contextual, factors in their explana-\ntion.\u2019 However, in reviewing research on language and society, Downes\u2019 reach\nfar exceeds that of Trudgill, even that of his glossary of terms (2003, p. 123),\nwhere he characterizes sociolinguistic research as \u2018work which is intended to\nachieve a better understanding of the nature of human language by studying\nlanguage in its social context and\/or to achieve a better understanding of the\nnature of the relationship and interaction between language and society.\u2019\n(A word of warning may be in order. Trudgill, Chambers, Downes, and I \u2013\nand many others we will come across \u2013 approach sociolinguistics from a back-\nground in linguistics rather than in sociology \u2013 or psychology, or feministstudies,\nor...Readers should always keep that fact in mind when assessing what wesay.)\nAs I have already indicated in referring earlier to Cameron\u2019s views (1997),\nthere is also a growing amount of work within a broadly defined sociolinguistics\nthat takes what I will call an \u2018interventionist\u2019 approach to matters that interest\nus. This work has been called \u2018linguistics with a conscience and a cause, one\nwhich seeks to reveal how language is used and abused in the exercise of power\nand the suppression of human rights\u2019 (Widdowson, 1998, p. 136). Two of its\nmain exponents are Fairclough (1995, 2001) and van Dijk (1993), whochampion\nan approach called \u2018critical discourse analysis.\u2019 This work focuses on howlanguage\nis used to exercise and preserve power and privilege in society, how it buttresses\nsocial institutions, and how even those who suffer as a consequence fail to\nrealize how many things that appear to be \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 are not at all\nso. They are not so because it is power relations in society that determine who\ngets to say what and who gets to write what. The claim is that politics,medicine,\nreligion, eduation, law, race, gender, and academia can only be understood for\nwhat they really are within the framework of critical discourse analysis: as\nsystems that maintain an unequal distribution of wealth, income, status, group\nmembership, education, and so on. Fairclough (2001, p. 6) expresses what he\nsees as the failure of sociolinguistics to deal with such matters as follows:\n\u2018Sociolinguistics is strong on \u201cwhat?\u201d questions (what are the facts of vari-\nation?) but weak on \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow?\u201d questions (why are the facts as they\nare?; how \u2013 in terms of the development of social relationships of power \u2013 was\nthe existing sociolinguistic order brought into being?; how is it sustained?; and\nhow might it be changed to the advantage of those who are dominated by it?).\u2019\nThis is very much an ideological view. Its proponents maintain that all lan-\nguage use is ideological as are all investigations, i.e., that there is no hope of\nan \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019 sociolinguistics. Consequently, critical discourse an-\nalysis is ideological and judgmental. It claims the high ground on issues; it is \u2018a\nresource for people who are struggling against domination and oppression in\nits linguistic forms\u2019 (Fairclough, 1995, p. 1). We might well exercise caution\nin assessing any claims we find: appeals to what is right tend to short-circuit\ngenuine scientific inquiry. In chapters 13\u201315 we will see examples of sociolin-\nguistic studies which are definitely interventionist in approach.\nAITC01 15 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 16 Introduction\nDiscussion\n1. Ethnomethodology (see chapter 10) is the study of commonsense knowledge\nand practical reasoning. To convince yourself that you have such knowledge\nand do employ such reasoning, see what happens if you react \u2018literally\u2019\nwhen someone next addresses you with such formulaic expressions as\nHow do you do? or Have a nice day. For example, you can respond Whatdo\nyou mean, \u2018How do I do?\u2019 or How do you define \u2018a nice day\u2019? (Be careful!)\nYou should find that commonsense knowledge tells you not to take every-\nthing you hear literally. So far as practical reasoning is concerned, collect\nexamples of how people actually do reach conclusions, give directions, and\nrelate actions to consequences or \u2018causes\u2019 to \u2018effects.\u2019 Do they do this in\nany \u2018scientific\u2019 manner?\n2. Bernstein, a British sociologist, has claimed that some children acquire a\nsomewhat limited exposure to the full range of language use as a result of\ntheir upbringing, and may consequently be penalized in school. What kinds\nof evidence would you consider to be relevant to confirming (or disconfirming)\nsuch a claim?\n3. Conversations are not simple matters. What can you say about each of the\nconversations that follow? Do you see anything you might call \u2018structural\u2019in\nsome that you do not see in others? How, in particular, does the last \u2018fail\u2019?\na. A. Excuse me!\nB. Yes.\nA. Gotta match?\nB. Sorry!\nA. Thanks.\nb. A. Gotta match?\nB. Nope?\nc. A. Excuse me, gotta match?\nB. Yes. (offer)\nA. (silence)\n4. Labov (1970, p. 30) has described the sociology of language as follows:\nIt deals with large-scale social factors, and their mutual interaction with lan-\nguages and dialects. There are many open questions, and many practical prob-\nlems associated with the decay and assimilation of minority languages, the\ndevelopment of stable bilingualism, the standardization of languages and the\nplanning of language development in newly emerging nations. The linguistic\ninput for such studies is primarily that a given person or group uses language\nX in a social context or domain Y.\nWhat are some of the \u2018questions\u2019 and \u2018problems\u2019 you see in your society,either\nbroadly or narrowly defined, that fall within such a sociology of language?\n5. As a further instance of a topic that might be covered in the sociology of\nlanguage, consider who speaks English in the world, where, and for what\nAITC01 16 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 17\npurposes? You might also contrast what you can find out about the uses of\nEnglish with what you can find out about the uses of Latin, Swahili, French,\nHaitian Creole, Basque, and Esperanto.\n6. Studies of linguistic variation make use of the concept of the \u2018linguistic\nvariable.\u2019 One simple linguistic variable in English is the pronunciation of\nthe final sound in words like singing, running, fishing, and going (-ing or\n-in\u2019) in contexts such as \u2018He was singing in the rain,\u2019 \u2018Running is fun,\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s a fishing boat,\u2019 and \u2018Are you going?\u2019 and on various occasions (e.g., in\ncasual conversation, in formal speech making, or in reading individual words\nout aloud). What do you find? How might you try to explain any differ-\nences you find?\nMethodological Concerns\nSociolinguistics should encompass everything from considering \u2018who speaks (or\nwrites) what language (or what language variety) to whom and when and to\nwhat end\u2019 (Fishman, 1972b, p. 46), that is, the social distribution of linguistic\nitems, to considering how a particular linguistic variable (see above) might relate\nto the formulation of a specific grammatical rule in a particular language or\ndialect, and even to the processes through which languages change. Whatever\nsociolinguistics is, it must be oriented toward both data and theory: that is, any\nconclusions we come to must be solidly based on evidence. Above all, our\nresearch must be motivated by questions that can be answered in an approved\nscientific way. Data collected for the sake of collecting data are of little interest,\nsince without some kind of focus \u2013 that is, without some kind of non-trivial\nmotive for collection \u2013 they can tell us little or nothing. A set of random\nobservations about how a few people we happen to observe use language cannot\nlead us to any useful generalizations about behavior, either linguistic or social.\nWe cannot be content with \u2018butterfly collecting,\u2019 no matter how beautiful the\nspecimens are! We must collect data for a purpose and that purpose should be\nto find an answer, or answers, to an interesting question. Questions phrased in\nways that do not allow for some kind of empirical testing have no more than\na speculative interest.\nThose who seek to investigate the possible relationships between language\nand society must have a twofold concern: they must ask good questions, and\nthey must find the right kinds of data that bear on those questions. We will\ndiscover how wide the variety of questions and data in sociolinguistics has been:\ncorrelational studies, which attempt to relate two or more variables (e.g., certain\nlinguistic usages to social-class differences); implicational studies, which suggest\nthat if X, then Y (e.g., if someone says tess for tests, does he or she also say bes\u2019\nfor best?); microlinguistic studies, which typically focus on very specificlinguistic\nitems or individual differences and uses and seek possibly wide-ranging lin-\nguistic and\/or social implications (e.g., the distribution of singing and singin\u2019);\nmacrolinguistic studies, which examine large amounts of language data to draw\nAITC01 17 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 18 Introduction\nbroad conclusions about group relationships (e.g., choices made in language\nplanning \u2013 see chapter 15); and still other studies, which try to arrive at general-\nizations about certain universal characteristics of human communication, e.g.,\nstudies of conversational structure.\nSince sociolinguistics is an empirical science, it must be founded on anadequate\ndatabase. As we will see, that database is drawn from a wide variety of sources.\nThese include censuses, documents, surveys, and interviews. Some data require\nthe investigator to observe \u2018naturally occurring\u2019 linguistic events, e.g., conversa-\ntions; others require the use of various elicitation techniques to gainaccess to\nthe data we require and different varieties of experimental manipulation, e.g.,\nthe matched-guise experiments referred to in chapters 4 and 14. Some kinds of\ndata require various statistical procedures, particularly when we wish to make\nstatements about the typical behavior of a group, e.g., a social class; other kinds\nseem best treated through such devices as graphing, scaling, and categorizing\nin non-statistical ways, as in dialect geography (see chapter 6) or the study of\nkinship systems (see chapter 9).\nA bona fide empirical science sets stringent demands so far as data collecting\nand analysis are concerned, demands involving sampling techniques, error esti-\nmation, and the confidence level, or the level of significance with which certain\nstatements can be made, particularly when arguments are based on numbers,\ne.g., averages, percentages, or proportions. As we will see (chapters 6\u20137), socio-\nlinguists try to meet these statistical demands when they are required. How-\never, many of the conclusions we can draw from sociolinguistic studies are ofa\nnon-statistical nature and leave no element of doubt. This is because much of\nlanguage use is categorical (i.e., something is or is not) rather than statistical\n(i.e., some phenomenon occurs with this or that probability). A recurring con-\ncern, then, must be with considering the certainty with which we can draw our\nconclusions in sociolinguistics. What is the theoretical framework? What are the\nrelevant data? What confidence can we have in the gathering of the data, andin\nthe analysis? What do the results really show? How should they be interpreted\nin relation to such concepts as \u2018identity,\u2019 \u2018power,\u2019 \u2018solidarity,\u2019 \u2018class,\u2019 \u2018gender,\u2019\netc.? What do we mean by such concepts? How useful are they in trying to\nachieve an understanding of how people function in society? What kind of\nsocial theory do we subscribe to? In these respects sociolinguistics is like all\nother sciences, so we should expect no less than that these requirements be met.\nAs part of an attempt to work out a set of principles, or axioms, whichsociolin-\nguistic investigations should follow, Bell (1976, pp. 187\u201391), drawingextensively\non the work of Labov, has suggested eight as worthy of consideration:\n1. The cumulative principle. The more that we know about language, the more\nwe can find out about it, and we should not be surprised if our search for\nnew knowledge takes us into new areas of study and into areas in which\nscholars from other disciplines are already working.\n2. The uniformation principle. The linguistic processes which we observe to be\ntaking place around us are the same as those which have operated in the\npast, so that there can be no clean break between synchronic (i.e., descrip-\ntive and contemporary) matters and diachronic (i.e., historical) ones.\nAITC01 18 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 19\n3. The principle of convergence. The value of new data for confirming or\ninterpreting old findings is directly proportional to the differences in theways\nin which the new data are gathered; particularly useful are linguistic data\ngathered through procedures needed in other areas of scientificinvestigation.\n4. The principle of subordinate shift. When speakers of a non-standard (or\nsubordinate) variety of language, e.g., a dialect, are asked direct questions\nabout that variety, their responses will shift in an irregular way toward or\naway from the standard (or superordinate) variety, e.g., the standard lan-\nguage, so enabling investigators to collect valuable evidence concerning such\nmatters as varieties, norms, and change.\n5. The principle of style-shifting. There are no \u2018single-style\u2019 speakers of a lan-\nguage, because each individual controls and uses a variety of linguistic styles\nand no one speaks in exactly the same way in all circumstances.\n6. The principle of attention. \u2018Styles\u2019 of speech can be ordered along a single\ndimension measured by the amount of attention speakers are giving to their\nspeech, so that the more \u2018aware\u2019 they are of what they are saying, the more\n\u2018formal\u2019 the style will be.\n7. The vernacular principle. The style which is most regular in its structure and\nin its relation to the history of the language is the vernacular, that relaxed,\nspoken style in which the least conscious attention is being paid to speech.\n8. The principle of formality. Any systematic observation of speech defines\na context in which some conscious attention will be paid to that speech,\nso that it will be difficult, without great ingenuity, to observe the genuine\n\u2018vernacular.\u2019\nThe last principle accounts for what Labov has called the \u2018observer\u2019sparadox.\u2019\nHe points out (1972b, pp. 209\u201310) that the aim of linguistic research is to find\nout how people talk when they are not being systematically observed, but the\ndata are available only through systematic observation. Somehow speakers must\nhave their attention diverted away from the fact that they are being observed so\nthat the vernacular can emerge. This can happen when speakers become emo-\ntional. Labov found that a question like \u2018Have you been in a situation whereyou\nwere in serious danger of being killed?\u2019 nearly always produces a shift of style\naway from careful speech toward the vernacular, thus providing the linguist\nwith the kinds of data being sought.\nThe above principles are fundamental to studies in language variation. Other\nkinds of studies will require other kinds of principles. Trying to make these\nexplicit will be one of the tasks I hope to accomplish in the chapters that follow.\nDiscussion\n1. The uniformation principle mentioned above proposes that there is a rela-\ntionship between synchronic (i.e., descriptive) and diachronic (i.e., histor-\nical) statements made about a language. There has been a long advocacy in\nlinguistics for separating the two (see Saussure, 1959, Bloomfield, 1933, and\njust about any introductory linguistics text written prior to the mid-1970s).\nAITC01 19 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 20 Introduction\nTry to discover the reasons that are usually given for such an insistence on\nseparation.\n2. To convince yourself that there are no \u2018single-style\u2019 speakers, try for an hour\nor two not to vary your speech style as circumstances change. For example,\ntry to speak to your cat (or dog), your close friends, your teachers, and\ncomplete strangers with exactly the same degree of formality (or informal-\nity), principles of word choice, precision of articulation, and method of\naddress (e.g., John, Mr Smith, Sir). Report what happened and how you felt\nabout what you were doing as the setting and participants changed. How\ndid others react? (Be careful: you might run into difficulties!)\n3. For Labov and other sociolinguists the vernacular is very important. What\ndo you understand by this term? When do you use such a variety? How\neasy or difficult is self-observation of that variety?\n4. On the whole we will be concerned with the spoken varieties of languages\nrather than the written varieties. What are some of the essential differences\nbetween the two? What do linguists mean when they say that the spoken\nlanguage is \u2018primary\u2019 and the written language is \u2018secondary\u2019? How do most\npeople relate the spoken and written varieties?\nOverview\nSociolinguistics brings together linguists and sociologists to investigate matters\nof joint concern but they are not the only researchers involved in studies of\nlanguage in society. Scholars from a variety of other disciplines have an interest\ntoo, e.g., anthropologists, psychologists, educators, and planners. We will see,\nfor example, that a number of anthropologists have done work which we can\ndescribe as sociolinguistic in nature, for example in the exploration of kinship\nsystems. The same may be said of certain psychologists, particularly those con-\ncerned with the possible effects of linguistic structure on social and psycholo-\ngical behavior. Many educators too must make decisions about mattersinvolving\nlanguage, such as the teaching of standard languages and the skills of literacy.As\nwe will discover in the latter case, some sociolinguists have been quite active in\ntrying to influence educators in their attitudes toward certain kinds of linguistic\nbehavior or varieties of language spoken by specific groups of children, such\nas the English spoken by certain black inhabitants of many cities in the northern\nUnited States, a variety sometimes referred to as African American Vernacular\nEnglish (see chapter 14). Language planners obviously need a considerable amount\nof linguistic knowledge in making sound decisions about, for example, which\nlanguage or language variety to encourage in certain circumstances, or in any\nattempts to standardize a particular language or variety, or to change existing\nrelationships between languages or varieties. We will observe that there are\nmany interconnections between sociolinguistics and other disciplines and also\nbetween concerns which are sometimes labeled theoretical and others which\nare said to be practical. At the very least, sociolinguistics is a socially relevant\nAITC01 20 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Introduction 21\nvariety of linguistics, but it is probably much more. You will be able to form\nyour own views on both issues as we proceed through the various topics treated\nin the chapters that follow.\nThese chapters are organized within four general topics. However, there will\nbe considerable moving back and forth with cross-referencing within topics and\namong topics. Inter-relationships are everywhere and I make no apology forthat.\nPart I, Languages and Communities, deals with some traditional language\nissues: trying to separate languages from dialects and looking at types of re-\ngional and social variation within languages (chapter 2); reviewing thephenomena\nof pidgins and creoles (chapter 3); conceiving of languages as codes (chapter 4);\nand trying to figure out what kinds of \u2018groups\u2019 are relevant when we study\nlanguage use (chapter 5).\nPart II, Inherent Variety, is sometimes regarded as \u2018core\u2019 sociolinguistics. Here\nthe concerns are factors in language variation (chapters 6\u20137) and what these\nmight show us about how languages change (chapter 8).\nPart III, Words at Work, is concerned with some traditional social and cul-\ntural issues: language as a possible shaper of culture (chapter 9); speech in a\nbroad social context (chapter 10); terms of address and expressions of politeness\nand what they mean (chapter 11); and certain essential characteristics of every-\nday language, i.e., how utterances can be acts and how conversation works\n(chapter 12).\nPart IV, Understanding and Intervening, looks into three areas of life in which\nsociolinguistics offers us some hope of understanding pressing problems (and\nwhich some sociolinguists argue require our deliberate intervention). Gender,one\nof the great \u2018growth areas\u2019 in language study, is the first of these (chapter 13).\nEducation, particularly because certain practices seem to \u2018advantage\u2019 some\nstudents and \u2018disadvantage\u2019 others, is the second (chapter 14). Language plan-\nning issues, as well as the spread of English and the \u2018death\u2019 of many languages,\nare the third (chapter 15). Chapter 16 provides a few concluding remarks.\nFurther Reading\nThe basic texts, going from roughly less difficult to more difficult, are Spolsky\n(1998), Trudgill (1995), Montgomery (1995), Holmes (1992), Romaine (2000),\nHudson (1996), Mesthrie et al. (2000), and Downes (1998). Fasold (1984,\n1990) is a two-volume treatment, and Ammon et al. (1987), Coulmas (1997),\nand Mesthrie (2001) attempt to provide comprehensive overviews. Murray (1998)\ndiscusses a variety of theoretical issues.\nFoley (1997) and Duranti (1997) are good anthropologically oriented treat-\nments of many of the topics that we will deal with. Edwards (1985) is concerned\nwith a variety of sociological matters and Fairclough writes about power (2001)\nand discourse (1995). Cook and Newson (1996) and Seuren (2004) discuss\nChomsky\u2019s linguistic ideas, and Smith (1999) both his linguistic and political\nideas. Crystal (1997) is a very readable reference book on language; Crystal\nAITC01 21 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 22 Introduction\n(2003a) and McArthur (1992) have lots of interesting observations aboutEnglish,\nand Asher and Simpson (1993) and Bright (1992) are encyclopedic in scope.\nRecent books of readings are the two volumes of Trudgill and Cheshire (1998)\nand Cheshire and Trudgill (1998), the more comprehensive Coupland and\nJaworski (1997), and Paulston and Tucker (2003).\nThe basic journals are Language in Society, Journal of Sociolinguistics, and\nInternational Journal of the Sociology of Language.\nDuranti (2001), Trudgill (2003), and Swann et al. (2004) offer useful cover-\nage of terms found in the sociolinguistic literature.\nAITC01 22 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 23\nPart I Languages and\nCommunities\nIn language there are only differences.\nFerdinand de Saussure\nStrange the difference of men\u2019s talk.\nSamuel Pepys\nChoice words, and measured phrase, above the reach\nOf ordinary men, a stately speech.\nWilliam Wordsworth\nCorrect English is the slang of prigs who write history and essays.\nGeorge Eliot\nLanguage is by its very nature a communal thing; that is,\nit expresses never the exact thing but a compromise \u2013 that which\nis common to you, me and everybody.\nT.

But what do we mean by variety? Hudson (1996, p. 22)\ndefines a variety of language as \u2018a set of linguistic items with similar distribu-\ntion,\u2019 a definition that allows us to say that all of the following are varieties:\nCanadian English, London English, the English of football commentaries, and\nso on. According to Hudson, this definition also allows us \u2018to treat all the\nlanguages of some multilingual speaker, or community, as a single variety, since\nall the linguistic items concerned have a similar social distribution.\u2019 A varietycan\ntherefore be something greater than a single language as well as something less,\nless even than something traditionally referred to as a dialect. Ferguson (1972,\np. 30) offers another definition of variety: \u2018any body of human speech patterns\nwhich is sufficiently homogeneous to be analyzed by available techniques of\nsynchronic description and which has a sufficiently large repertory of elements\nand their arrangements or processes with broad enough semantic scope tofunction\nin all formal contexts of communication.\u2019 Note the words \u2018sufficiently homoge-\nneous\u2019 in this last quotation. Complete homogeneity is not required; there is\nalways some variation whether we consider a language as a whole, a dialect of\nthat language, the speech of a group within that dialect, or, ultimately, each\nindividual in that group. Such variation is a basic fact of linguistic life.\nHudson and Ferguson agree in defining variety in terms of a specific set of\n\u2018linguistic items\u2019 or \u2018human speech patterns\u2019 (presumably, sounds, words, gram-\nmatical features, etc.) which we can uniquely associate with some external\nfactor (presumably, a geographical area or a social group). Consequently, if we\ncan identify such a unique set of items or patterns for each group in question,\nit might be possible to say there are such varieties as Standard English, Cockney,\nlower-class New York City speech, Oxford English, legalese, cocktail party\ntalk, and so on. One important task, then, in sociolinguistics is to determine if\nsuch unique sets of items or patterns do exist. As we proceed we will encounter\ncertain difficulties, but it is unlikely that we will easily abandon the concept of\n\u2018variety,\u2019 no matter how serious these difficulties prove to be.\nAITC02 25 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 26 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nDiscussion\n1. I have just suggested that, although a concept like \u2018variety\u2019 is difficult to\ndefine, it may still be useful in sociolinguistic work. Linguists have foundsuch\nconcepts as \u2018sound,\u2019 \u2018syllable,\u2019 \u2018word,\u2019 and \u2018sentence\u2019 equally difficult todefine\n(in contrast to lay usage, in which they are just assumed to be obvious and\nuncontroversial). In one sense, linguistics is all about trying to provide\nadequate definitions for words such as sound, syllable, word, sentence, and\nlanguage. What are some of the problems you are aware of concerning the\nlinguist\u2019s difficulty with these words and the associated concepts? What\nparallels do you see, if any, between these problems and the sociolinguist\u2019s\nproblem with variety (and the other terms to be used in the remainder of\nthis chapter)?\n2. Hymes (1974, p. 123) has observed that language boundaries between groups\nare drawn not on the basis of the use of linguistic items alone, because\nattitudes and social meanings attached to those items also count. He says:\nAny enduring social relationship or group may come to define itself by selec-\ntion and\/or creation of linguistic features, and a difference of accent may be\nas important at one boundary as a difference of grammar at another. Part of\nthe creativity of users of languages lies in the freedom to determine what and\nhow much linguistic difference matters.\nHow does this inter-relationship between linguistic items and the social\nevaluations of such items apply in how we regard each of the following\npronunciations?\na. butter, budder, bu\u2019er\nb. fishing, fishin\u2019\nc. farm, fahm\nd. width pronounced like wit, like with\ne. Cuba pronounced as Cuber\nf. ate pronounced like eight, like et\ng. been pronounced like bean, like bin\nh. mischievous pronounced with four syllables (i.e., as mischievious)\ni. aluminum, aluminium\nj. p\u00f3lice, g\u00faitar, D\u00e9troit (with the stress as indicated)\nAnd each of the following utterances?\na. He hurt hisself.\nb. He done it.\nc. He dove in.\nd. He run away last week.\ne. It looks like it\u2019s going to rain.\nf. To whom did you give it?\ng. She\u2019s taller than me now.\nAITC02 26 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 27\nh. Yesterday he laid down after lunch for an hour.\ni. Can I leave the room?\nj. He ain\u2019t got no money left.\nk. Try and do it soon.\nl. Between you and me, I don\u2019t like it.\nm. There\u2019s twenty dollars for you to spend.\nn. She invited Sally and I to the party.\no. I wants it.\np. You done it, did you?\nq. Stand over by them boys.\nr. Is he the one what said it?\ns. They don\u2019t learn you nothing there.\nLanguage and Dialect\nFor many people there can be no confusion at all about what language they\nspeak. For example, they are Chinese, Japanese, or Korean and they speak\nChinese, Japanese, and Korean respectively. It is as simple as that; language and\nethnicity are virtually synonymous (Coulmas, 1999). A Chinese may besurprised\nto find that another person who appears to be Chinese does not speak Chinese,\nand some Japanese have gone so far as to claim not to be able to understand\nCaucasians who speak fluent Japanese. Just as such a strong connection between\nlanguage and ethnicity may prove to be invaluable in nation-building, it can also\nbe fraught with problems when individuals and groups seek to realize someother\nidentity, e.g., to be both Chinese and American, or to be Canadian rather than\nKorean-Canadian. As we will see (p. 368), many Americans seem particularly\nreluctant to equate language with ethnicity in their own case: although they\nregard English as the \u2018natural\u2019 language of Americans, they do not consider\nAmerican to be an ethnic label. The results may be the same; only the reasons\ndiffer.\nMost speakers can give a name to whatever it is they speak. On occasion,some\nof these names may appear to be strange to those who take a scientific interest\nin languages, but we should remember that human naming practices often have\na large \u2018unscientific\u2019 component to them. Census-takers in India find themselves\nconfronted with a wide array of language names when they ask people what\nlanguage or languages they speak. Names are not only ascribed by region, which\nis what we might expect, but sometimes also by caste, religion, village, and so\non. Moreover, they can change from census to census as the political and social\nclimate of the country changes.\nWhile people do usually know what language they speak, they may notalways\nlay claim to be fully qualified speakers of that language. They may experience\ndifficulty in deciding whether what they speak should be called a languageproper\nor merely a dialect of some language. Such indecision is not surprising: exactly\nhow do you decide what is a language and what is a dialect of a language? What\nAITC02 27 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 28 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\ncriteria can you possibly use to determine that, whereas variety X is a language,\nvariety Y is only a dialect of a language? What are the essential differences\nbetween a language and a dialect?\nHaugen (1966a) has pointed out that language and dialect are ambiguous\nterms. Ordinary people use these terms quite freely in speech; for them a dialect\nis almost certainly no more than a local non-prestigious (therefore powerless)\nvariety of a real language. In contrast, scholars often experience considerable\ndifficulty in deciding whether one term should be used rather than the other in\ncertain situations. As Haugen says, the terms \u2018represent a simple dichotomy in\na situation that is almost infinitely complex.\u2019 He points out that the confusion\ngoes back to the Ancient Greeks. The Greek language that we associate with\nAncient Greece was actually a group of distinct local varieties (Ionic, Doric, and\nAttic) descended by divergence from a common spoken source with each variety\nhaving its own literary traditions and uses, e.g., Ionic for history, Doric forchoral\nand lyric works, and Attic for tragedy. Later, Athenian Greek, the koin\u00e9 \u2013 or\n\u2018common\u2019 language \u2013 became the norm for the spoken language as the various\nspoken varieties converged on the dialect of the major cultural andadministrative\ncenter. Haugen points out (p. 923) that the Greek situation has provided the\nmodel for all later usages of the two terms with the resulting ambiguity. Lan-\nguage can be used to refer either to a single linguistic norm or to a group of\nrelated norms, and dialect to refer to one of the norms.\nThe situation is further confused by the distinction the French make between\nun dialecte and un patois. The former is a regional variety of a language that\nhas an associated literary tradition, whereas the latter is a regional variety that\nlacks such a literary tradition. Therefore patois tends to be used pejoratively; it\nis regarded as something less than a dialect because of its lack of an associated\nliterature. Even a language like Breton, a Celtic language still spoken in parts\nof Brittany, is called a patois because of its lack of a strong literary tradition and\nthe fact that it is not some country\u2019s language. However, dialecte in French, like\nDialekt in German, cannot be used in connection with the standard language,\ni.e., no speaker of French considers Standard French to be a dialect of French.\nIn contrast, it is not uncommon to find references to Standard English being a\ndialect \u2013 admittedly a very important one \u2013 of English.\nHaugen points out that, while speakers of English have never seriously adopted\npatois as a term to be used in the description of language, they have tried to\nemploy both language and dialect in a number of conflicting senses. Dialect is\nused both for local varieties of English, e.g., Yorkshire dialect, and for various\ntypes of informal, lower-class, or rural speech. \u2018In general usage it therefore\nremains quite undefined whether such dialects are part of the \u201clanguage\u201d or\nnot. In fact, the dialect is often thought of as standing outside the language....\nAs a social norm, then, a dialect is a language that is excluded from polite\nsociety\u2019 (pp. 924\u20135). It is often equivalent to nonstandard or even substandard,\nwhen such terms are applied to language, and can connote various degrees of\ninferiority, with that connotation of inferiority carried over to those who speak\na dialect.\nWe can observe too that questions such as \u2018Which language do you speak?\u2019\nor \u2018Which dialect do you speak?\u2019 may be answered quite differently by people\nAITC02 28 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 29\nwho appear to speak in an identical manner. As Gumperz (1982a, p. 20) has\npointed out, many regions of the world provide plenty of evidence for what he\ncalls \u2018a bewildering array of language and dialect divisions.\u2019 He adds: \u2018socio-\nhistorical factors play a crucial role in determining boundaries. Hindi and Urdu\nin India, Serbian and Croatian in Yugoslavia [of that date], Fanti and Twi in\nWest Africa, Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk in Norway, Kechwa and Aimara in Peru, to\nname just a few, are recognized as discrete languages both popularly and in law,\nyet they are almost identical at the level of grammar. On the other hand, the\nliterary and colloquial forms of Arabic used in Iraq, Morocco, and Egypt, or the\nWelsh of North and South Wales, the local dialects of Rajasthan and Bihar in\nNorth India are grammatically quite separate, yet only one language is recog-\nnized in each case.\u2019\nThe Hindi\u2013Urdu situation that Gumperz mentions is an interesting one. Hindi\nand Urdu are the same language, but one in which certain differences are becom-\ning more and more magnified for political and religious reasons. Hindi is written\nleft to right in the Devanagari script, whereas Urdu is written right to left in the\nArabic\u2013Persian script. Whereas Hindi draws on Sanskrit for its borrowings,Urdu\ndraws on Arabic and Persian sources. Large religious and political differences\nmake much of small linguistic differences. The written forms of the two vari-\neties, particularly those favored by the elites, also emphasize these differences.\nThey have become highly symbolic of the growing differences between India and\nPakistan. (We should note that the situation in India and Pakistan is in almost\ndirect contrast to that which exists in China, where mutually unintelligible\nChinese languages (called \u2018dialects\u2019 by the Chinese themselves) are united through\na common writing system and tradition.)\nGumperz (1971, pp. 56\u20137) points out that everyday living in parts of India,\nparticularly in the large cities and among educated segments of those commun-\nities, requires some complex choices involving the distinction between Hindi and\nUrdu:\nSince independence Hindi has become compulsory in schools, but Urdu continues\nto be used extensively in commerce, and the Ghazal, the best known form of Urdu\npoetry, is universally popular. If we look at the modern realist Hindi writers, we\nfind that they utilize both Sanskrit and Persian borrowings. The juxtaposition of\nthe two styles serves to express subtle shades of meaning and to lend reality to their\nwritings. Similarly on the conversational level the use of Hindi and Urdu forms is\nnot simply a matter of birth and education. But, just as it is customary forindividuals\nto alternate between dialect and standard depending on the social occasion, so\nwhen using the standard itself the speaker may select from a range of alternatives.\nHindi and Urdu therefore might best be characterized not in terms of actual speech,\nbut as norms or ideal behavior in the sociologist\u2019s sense. The extent to which a\nspeaker\u2019s performance in a particular communication situation approximates the\nnorm is a function of a combination of factors such as family background, regional\norigin, education and social attitude and the like.\nSo far as everyday use is concerned, therefore, it appears that the boundary\nbetween the spoken varieties of Hindi and Urdu is somewhat flexible and one\nthat changes with circumstances. This is exactly what we would expect: there\nAITC02 29 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 30 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nis considerable variety in everyday use but somewhere in the background there\nis an ideal that can be appealed to, proper Hindi or proper Urdu.\nIn the first of the two quotations from Gumperz there is a reference to\nYugoslavia, a country now brutally dismembered by the instruments ofethnicity,\nlanguage, and religion. Within the old Yugoslavia Serbs and Croats failed to\nagree on most things and after the death of President Tito the country, slowly\nat first and then ever more rapidly later, fell into a fatal divisiveness. Slovenians\nand Macedonians excised themselves most easily, but the Serbs and the Croats\nwere not so lucky. Linguistically, Serbo-Croatian is a single South Slav language\nbut one used by two groups of people, the Serbs and Croats, with somewhat\ndifferent historical, cultural, and religious backgrounds. There is a third group\nin Bosnia, a Muslim group, who also speak Serbo-Croatian, and their existence\nfurther compounded the problems and increased the eventual bloodshed.Finally,\nthere is a very small Montenegrin group. The Serbian and Croatian varieties of\nSerbo-Croatian are known as srpski and srpskohrvatski respectively. The actual\ndifferences between them involve different preferences in vocabulary rather\nthan differences in pronunciation or grammar. That is, Serbs and Croats often\nuse different words for the same concepts, e.g., Serbian varos and Croatian grad\nfor \u2018train.\u2019 The varieties are written in different scripts (Roman for Croatian and\nCyrillic for Serbian), which also reflect the different religious loyalties of Croats\nand Serbs (Catholic and Orthodox). As conflict grew, differences became more\nand more important and the country and the language split apart. Now inSerbia\npeople speak Serbian just as they speak Croatian in Croatia. Serbo-Croatian no\nlonger exists as a language of the Balkans. And now that there is a separate\nBosnia the Bosnians call their variety bosanski and Montenegrins call their\nvariety crnogorski (Carmichael, 2002, p. 236, and Greenberg, 2004).\nIn direct contrast to the above situation, we can observe that the loyalty of\na group of people need not necessarily be determined by the language they\nspeak. Although the majority of the people in Alsace are speakers of a variety\nof German insofar as the language of their home-life is concerned, their loyalty\nis unquestionably toward France. They look west not east for national leader-\nship and they use French, not German, as the language of mobility and higher\neducation. However, everyday use of Alsatian is a strong marker of localidentity;\nit is an important part of being Alsatian in France. We can contrast thissituation\nwith that in another area of France. In Brittany a separatist movement, that is,\na movement for local autonomy if not complete independence, is centered on\nBreton, a language which, unfortunately for those who speak it, is in serious\ndecline. Breton identity no longer has the support of widespread use of the\nlanguage.\nThe various relationships among languages and dialects discussed above can\nbe used to show how the concepts of \u2018power\u2019 and \u2018solidarity\u2019 help us understand\nwhat is happening. Power requires some kind of asymmetrical relationship\nbetween entities: one has more of something that is important, e.g. status,\nmoney, influence, etc., than the other or others. A language has more power\nthan any of its dialects. It is the powerful dialect but it has become so because\nof non-linguistic factors. Standard English and Parisian French are goodexamples.\nSolidarity, on the other hand, is a feeling of equality that people have with one\nAITC02 30 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 31\nanother. They have a common interest around which they will bond. A feeling\nof solidarity can lead people to preserve a local dialect or an endangeredlanguage\nto resist power, or to insist on independence. It accounts for the persistence of\nlocal dialects, the modernization of Hebrew, and the separation of Serbo-Croatian\ninto Serbian and Croatian.\nThe language\u2013dialect situation along the border between the Netherlands and\nGermany is an interesting one. Historically, there was a continuum of dialectsof\none language, but the two that eventually became standardized as the languages\nof the Netherlands and Germany, Standard Dutch and Standard German, arenot\nmutually intelligible, that is, a speaker of one cannot understand a speaker of\nthe other. In the border area speakers of the local varieties of Dutch and German\nstill exist within that dialect continuum (see p. 45) and remain largely intelligible\nto one another, yet the people on one side of the border say they speak a variety\nof Dutch and those on the other side say they speak a variety of German. The\nresidents of the Netherlands look to Standard Dutch for their model; they read\nand write Dutch, are educated in Dutch, and watch television in Dutch. Con-\nsequently, they say they use a local variety, or dialect, of Dutch in their daily\nlives. On the other side of the border, German replaces Dutch in all equivalent\nsituations. The interesting linguistic fact, though, is that there are more similar-\nities between the local varieties spoken on each side of the border than between\nthe one dialect (of Dutch?) and Standard Dutch and the other dialect (ofGerman?)\nand Standard German, and more certainly than between that dialect and the\nsouth German, Swiss, and Austrian dialects of German. However, it is also\nof interest to note (Kremer, 1999) that younger speakers of Dutch in this area\nof the Netherlands are more conscious of the standard language border than\nolder speakers. Apparently, their Dutch identity triumphs over any linguistic\nconnections they have with speakers of the same dialect over the national\nborder.\nGumperz has suggested some of the confusions that result from popular uses\nof the terms language and dialect. To these we can add the situation inScandinavia\nas further evidence. Danish, Norwegian (actually two varieties), and Swedish are\nrecognized as different languages, yet if you speak any one of them you will\nexperience little difficulty in communicating while traveling in Scandinavia (ex-\ncluding, of course, Finland, or at least the non-Swedish-speaking parts of that\ncountry). Danish and Norwegian share much vocabulary but differ considerably\nin pronunciation. In contrast, there are considerable vocabulary differences\nbetween Swedish and Norwegian but they are similar in pronunciation. Both\nDanes and Swedes claim good understanding of Norwegian. However, Danes\nclaim to comprehend Norwegians much better than Norwegians claim to\ncomprehend Danes. The poorest mutual comprehension is between Danes and\nSwedes and the best is between Norwegians and Swedes. These differences in\nmutual intelligibility appear to reflect power relationships: Denmark long dom-\ninated Norway, and Sweden is today the most influential country in the region\nand Denmark the least powerful.\nA somewhat similar situation exists in the relationship of Thai and Lao. The\nLaos understand spoken Thai and hear Thai constantly on radio and television.\nEducated Laos can also read written Thai. However, Thais do not readily\nAITC02 31 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 32 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nunderstand spoken Lao nor do they read the written variety. Lao is a low-\nprestige language so far as Thais are concerned; in contrast, Thai has high\nprestige in Laos. Thais, therefore, are unwilling to expend effort to understand\nLao, whereas Laos are willing to make the extra effort to understand Thai.\nIf we turn our attention to China, we will find that speakers of Cantonese and\nMandarin will tell you that they use the same language. However, if one speaker\nknows only Cantonese and the other only Mandarin, they will not be able to\nconverse with each other: they actually speak different languages, certainly as\ndifferent as German and Dutch and even Portuguese and Italian. If the speakers\nare literate, however, they will be able to communicate with each other through\na shared writing system. They will almost certainly insist that they speak dif-\nferent dialects of Chinese, not different languages, for to the Chinese a shared\nwriting system and a strong tradition of political, social, and cultural unity form\nessential parts of their definition of language.\nThe situation can become even more confused. A speaker of Cockney, a\nhighly restricted London variety of English, may find it difficult to communicate\nwith natives of the Ozark Mountains in the United States. Do they therefore\nspeak separate languages? Is there one English language spoken in Britain and\nanother, American, spoken in the New World? The American writer Mencken\n(1919) had very definite views that the varieties spoken on the two sides of the\nAtlantic were sufficiently distinctive to warrant different appellations. It is also\nnot unusual to find French translations of American books described on their\ntitle pages as translations from \u2018American\u2019 rather than \u2018English.\u2019 Is there a bona\nfide separate Scottish variety of English? There was before the crowns and\nparliaments were united several centuries ago. However, today there is no clear\nanswer to that question as the power relationship between England andScotland\nfluctuates and the issue of language differences is but one of many that must be\ndealt with. Is the French of Quebec a dialect of Standard (continental) French,\nor should we regard it as a separate language, particularly after a political\nseparation of well over two centuries? Is Haitian Creole (see p. 84) a variety of\nFrench, or is it an entirely separate language, and if so in what ways is it\nseparate and different? How do the different varieties of English spoken in\nJamaica (see p. 81) relate to other varieties of English? Or is that question really\nanswerable? What, above all, is English? How can we define it as something\napart from what Speaker A uses, or Speaker B, or Speaker C? If it is something\nA, B, and C share, just what is it that they do share?\nWe undoubtedly agree that this book is written in English and that English\nis a language, but we may be less certain that various other things we see written\nor hear spoken in what is called English should properly be regarded as English\nrather than as dialects or varieties of English, perhaps variously described as\nIndian English, Australian English, New York English, West Country English,\nAfrican American Vernacular English, nonstandard English, BBC English, and\nso on. A language then would be some unitary system of linguistic commun-\nication which subsumes a number of mutually intelligible varieties. It would\ntherefore be bigger than a single dialect or a single variety. However, that cannot\nalways be the case, for some such systems used by very small numbers of\nspeakers may have very little internal variation. Yet each must be a language,\nAITC02 32 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 33\nfor it is quite unlike any other existing system. Actually, neither the requirement\nthat there be internal variation nor the \u2018numbers game,\u2019 i.e., that a language\nmust somehow be \u2018bigger\u2019 than a dialect, offers much help. Many languages\nhave only a handful of speakers; several have actually been known to have had\nonly a single remaining speaker at a particular point in time and the language\nhas \u2018died\u2019 with that speaker.\nStill another difficulty arises from the fact that the terms language and dialect\nare also used in an historical sense. It is possible to speak of languages such as\nEnglish, German, French, Russian, and Hindi as Indo-European dialects. In this\ncase the assumption is that there was once a single language, Indo-European,\nthat the speakers of that language (which may have had various dialects) spread\nto different parts of the world, and that the original language eventuallydiverged\ninto the various languages we subsume today under the Indo-European family\nof languages. However, we should also be aware that this process of divergence\nwas not as clean-cut as this classical neo-grammarian model of language differ-\nentiation suggests. (In such a model all breaks are clean, and once two varieties\ndiverge they lose contact with each other.) Processes of convergence must also\nhave occurred, even of convergence among entirely unrelated languages (that is,\nlanguages without any \u2018family\u2019 resemblance). For example, Indo-European and\nDravidian languages have influenced each other in southern India and Sri Lanka,\nand in the Balkans there is considerable evidence of the spread of common\nfeatures across languages such as Albanian, Greek, Turkish, and several Slavic\nlanguages. In such situations, language and dialect differences become further\nobscured, particularly when many speakers are also likely to be multilingual.\nPerhaps some of the difficulties we have with trying to define the termlanguage\narise from trying to subsume various different types of systems of communica-\ntion under that one label. An alternative approach might be to acknowledge that\nthere are different kinds of languages and attempt to discover how languagescan\ndiffer from one another yet still be entities that most of us would want to call\nlanguages rather than dialects. It might then be possible to define a dialect as\nsome sub-variety of one or more of these entities.\nOne such attempt (see Bell, 1976, pp. 147\u201357) has listed seven criteria that\nmay be useful in discussing different kinds of languages. According to Bell, these\ncriteria (standardization, vitality, historicity, autonomy, reduction, mixture, and\nde facto norms) may be used to distinguish certain languages from others. They\nalso make it possible to speak of some languages as being more \u2018developed\u2019 in\ncertain ways than others, thus addressing a key issue in the language\u2013dialect\ndistinction, since speakers usually feel that languages are generally \u2018better\u2019 than\ndialects in some sense.\nStandardization refers to the process by which a language has been codified\nin some way. That process usually involves the development of such things as\ngrammars, spelling books, and dictionaries, and possibly a literature. We can\noften associate specific items or events with standardization, e.g., Wycliffe\u2019s and\nLuther\u2019s translations of the Bible into English and German, respectively, Caxton\u2019s\nestablishment of printing in England, and Dr Johnson\u2019s dictionary of English\npublished in 1755. Standardization also requires that a measure of agreement\nbe achieved about what is in the language and what is not. Once we have such\nAITC02 33 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 34 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\na codification of the language we tend to see it as almost inevitable, the result\nof some process come to fruition, one that has also reached a fixed end point.\nChange, therefore, should be resisted since it can only undo what has been done\nso laboriously. Milroy (2001, p. 537) characterizes the resulting ideology as\nfollows: \u2018The canonical form of the language is a precious inheritance that has\nbeen built up over the generations, not by the millions of native speakers, but\nby a select few who have lavished loving care upon it, polishing, refining, and\nenriching it until it has become a fine instrument of expression (often these are\nthought to be literary figures, such as Shakespeare). This is a view held by\npeople in many walks of life, including plumbers, politicians and professors of\nliterature. It is believed that if the canonical variety is not universally supported\nand protected, the language will inevitably decline and decay.\u2019\nOnce a language is standardized it becomes possible to teach it in a deliberate\nmanner. It takes on ideological dimensions \u2013 social, cultural, and sometimes\npolitical \u2013 beyond the purely linguistic ones. In Fairclough\u2019s words (2001, p. 47)\nit becomes \u2018part of a much wider process of economic, political and cultural\nunification...of great...importance in the establishment of nationhood, andthe\nnation-state is the favoured form of capitalism.\u2019 According to these criteria, both\nEnglish and French are quite obviously standardized, Italian somewhat less so,\nand the variety known as African American Vernacular English (see chapter 14)\nnot at all.\nHaugen (1966a) has indicated certain steps that must be followed if onevariety\nof a language is to become the standard for that language. In addition to what\nhe calls the \u2018formal\u2019 matters of codification and elaboration, the former referring\nto the development of such things as grammars and dictionaries and the latter\nreferring to the use of the standard in such areas as literature, the courts, edu-\ncation, administration, and commerce, Haugen says there are important matters\nto do with \u2018function.\u2019 For example, a norm must be selected and acceptedbecause\nneither codification nor elaboration is likely to proceed very far if thecommunity\ncannot agree on some kind of model to act as a norm. That norm is also likelyto\nbe \u2013 or to become \u2013 an idealized norm, one that users of the language are asked\nto aspire to rather than one that actually accords with their observed behavior.\nSelection of the norm may prove difficult because choosing one vernacular as\na norm means favoring those who speak that variety. It also diminishes all the\nother varieties and possible competing norms, and those who use those varieties.\nThe chosen norm inevitably becomes associated with power and the rejected\nalternatives with lack of power. Not surprisingly, it usually happens that a\nvariety associated with an elite is chosen. Attitudes are all-important, however.\nA group that feels intense solidarity may be willing to overcome great linguistic\ndifferences in establishing a norm, whereas one that does not have this feeling\nmay be unable to overcome relatively small differences and be unable to agree\non a single variety and norm. Serbs and Croats were never able to agree on a\nnorm, particularly as other differences reinforced linguistic ones. In contrast, we\ncan see how Indonesia and Malaysia are looking for ways to reduce thedifferences\nbetween their languages, with their common Islamic bond a strong incentive.\nThe standardization process itself performs a variety of functions (Mathiot\nand Garvin, 1975). It unifies individuals and groups within a larger community\nAITC02 34 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 35\nwhile at the same time separating the community that results from other com-\nmunities. Therefore, it can be employed to reflect and symbolize some kind of\nidentity: regional, social, ethnic, or religious. A standardized variety can also be\nused to give prestige to speakers, marking off those who employ it from those\nwho do not, i.e., those who continue to speak a nonstandard variety. It can\ntherefore serve as a kind of goal for those who have somewhat different norms;\nStandard English and Standard French are such goals for many whose norms are\ndialects of these languages. However, as we will see (particularly in chapters 6\u2013\n8), these goals are not always pursued and may even be resisted.\nIt still may not be at all easy for us to define Standard English because of\na failure to agree about the norm or norms that should apply. For example,\nTrudgill (1995, pp. 5\u20136) defines Standard English as follows (note his use of\n\u2018usually\u2019 and \u2018normally\u2019 in this definition):\nStandard English is that variety of English which is usually used in print, and\nwhich is normally taught in schools and to non-native speakers learning the lan-\nguage. It is also the variety which is normally spoken by educated people and used\nin news broadcasts and other similar situations. The difference between standard\nand nonstandard, it should be noted, has nothing in principle to do with differ-\nences between formal and colloquial language, or with concepts such as \u2018bad\nlanguage.\u2019 Standard English has colloquial as well as formal variants, and Standard\nEnglish speakers swear as much as others.\nHistorically, the standard variety of English is based on the dialect of English\nthat developed after the Norman Conquest resulted in the permanent removal\nof the Court from Winchester to London. This dialect became the one preferred\nby the educated, and it was developed and promoted as a model, or norm, for\nwider and wider segments of society. It was also the norm that was carried\noverseas, but not one unaffected by such export. Today, Standard English is\ncodified to the extent that the grammar and vocabulary of English are much the\nsame everywhere in the world: variation among local standards is really quite\nminor, being differences of \u2018flavor\u2019 rather than of \u2018substance,\u2019 so that theSingapore,\nSouth African, and Irish varieties are really very little different from one another\nso far as grammar and vocabulary are concerned. Indeed, Standard English is\nso powerful that it exerts a tremendous pressure on all local varieties, to the\nextent that many of the long-established dialects of England and the Lowlands\nEnglish of Scotland have lost much of their vigor. There is considerable pressure\non them to converge toward the standard. This latter situation is not unique to\nEnglish: it is also true in other countries in which processes of standardization\nare under way. It does, however, sometimes create problems for speakers who\ntry to strike some kind of compromise between local norms and national, even\nsupranational, ones.\nGovernments sometimes very deliberately involve themselves in the standard-\nization process by establishing official bodies of one kind or another to regulate\nlanguage matters or to encourage changes felt to be desirable. One of the most\nfamous examples of an official body established to promote the language of a\ncountry was Richelieu\u2019s establishment of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1635. Founded\nAITC02 35 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 36 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nat a time when a variety of languages existed in France, when literacy wasconfined\nto a very few, and when there was little national consciousness, the Acad\u00e9mie\nFran\u00e7aise faced an unenviable task: the codification of French spelling,vocabulary,\nand grammar. Its goal was to fashion and reinforce French nationality, a most\nimportant task considering that, even two centuries later in the early nineteenth\ncentury, the French of Paris was virtually unknown in many parts of thecountry,\nparticularly in the south. Similar attempts to found academies in England and\nthe United States for the same purpose met with no success, individualdictionary-\nmakers and grammar-writers having performed much the same function for\nEnglish. Since both French and English are today highly standardized, one might\nquestion whether such academies serve a useful purpose, yet it is difficult to\nimagine France without the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise: it undoubtedly has had a con-\nsiderable influence on the French people and perhaps on their language.\nStandardization is sometimes deliberately undertaken quite rapidly for polit-\nical reasons. In the nineteenth century Finns developed their spoken language to\nmake it serve a complete set of functions. They needed a standardized language\nto assert their independence from both Swedes and Russians. They succeeded in\ntheir task so that now the Finnish language has become a strong force in the\nnation\u2019s political life and a strong marker of Finnish identity among Germanic\ntongues on the one side and Slavic tongues on the other. In the twentieth cen-\ntury the Turks under Atat\u00fcrk were likewise successful in their attempt to both\nstandardize and \u2018modernize\u2019 Turkish. Today, we can see similar attempts atrapid\nstandardization in countries such as India (Hindi), Israel (Hebrew), Papua New\nGuinea (Tok Pisin), Indonesia (Bahasa Indonesia), and Tanzania (Swahili). In\neach case a language or a variety of a language had to be selected, developedin\nits resources and functions, and finally accepted by the larger society. As we\nhave seen, standardization is an ideological matter. Williams (1992, p. 146) calls\nit \u2018a sociopolitical process involving the legitimisation and institutionalisation\nof a language variety as a feature of sanctioning of that variety as socially\npreferable.\u2019 It creates a preferred variety of a language, which then becomes the\nwinner in a struggle for dominance. The dispreferred varieties are losers.\nThe standardization process occasionally results in some languages actually\nachieving more than one standardized variety. Norwegian is a good examplewith\nits two standards, Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l. In this case there is a special problem,\nthat of trying to unify the two varieties in a way that pleases everyone. Some\nkind of unification or amalgamation is now official government policy (see\npp. 373\u20134). Countries with two or more competing languages that cannot\npossibly be unified may tear themselves apart, as we saw in Yugoslavia, or\nperiodically seem to come very close to doing that, as with Belgium and Canada\n(see chapter 15).\nStandardization is also an ongoing matter, for only \u2018dead\u2019 languages like Latin\nand Classical Greek are standardized for all time. Living languages change and\nthe standardization process is necessarily an ongoing one. It is also one that may\nbe described as more advanced in languages like French or German and less\nadvanced in languages like Bahasa Indonesia and Swahili.\nHindi is still in the process of being standardized in India. That process is\nhindered by widespread regional resistance to Hindi out of the fear that regional\nAITC02 36 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 37\nlanguages may be submerged or, if not submerged, quite diminished. So far as\nstandardization is concerned, there are problems with accepting local varieties,\nand with developing and teaching the existing standard as though it were a\nclassical language like Sanskrit and downplaying it as a living language. Hindi\nis still often taught much like Latin in schools in the West; it is in many places\nan underused second language at best; children are not encouraged \u2018to play in\nHindi,\u2019 and teachers rarely employ Hindi as a language of instruction. Likewise,\nthe kinds of literature available in Hindi are still very limited, there being short-\nages of everyday reading materials that might appeal to the young, e.g., comic\nbooks, mystery stories, and collections of folk tales. Consequently, the process\nof the standardization of a \u2018living\u2019 Hindi is proving to be a slow one.\nThe standardization process is also obviously one that attempts either toreduce\nor to eliminate diversity and variety. However, there may well be a sense inwhich\nsuch diversity and variety are \u2018natural\u2019 to all languages, assuring them of their\nvitality and enabling them to change (see chapter 8). To that extent, standard-\nization imposes a strain on languages or, if not on the languages themselves, on\nthose who take on the task of standardization. That may be one of the reasons\nwhy various national academies have had so many difficulties in their work:they\nare essentially in a no-win situation, always trying to \u2018fix\u2019 the consequences of\nchanges that they cannot prevent, and continually being compelled to issue new\npronouncements on linguistic matters. Unfortunately, those who think you can\nstandardize and \u2018fix\u2019 a language for all time are often quite influential. They\noften find ready access to the media, there to bewail the fact that English, for\nexample, is becoming \u2018degenerate\u2019 and \u2018corrupt,\u2019 and to advise us to return to\nwhat they regard as a more perfect past. They may also resist what they con-\nsider to be \u2018dangerous\u2019 innovations, e.g., the translation of a sacred book into\na modern idiom or the issue of a new dictionary. Since the existence of internal\nvariation is one aspect of language and the fact that all languages keep changing\nis another, we cannot be too sympathetic to such views.\nVitality, the second of Bell\u2019s seven criteria, refers to the existence of a living\ncommunity of speakers. This criterion can be used to distinguish languages that\nare \u2018alive\u2019 from those that are \u2018dead.\u2019 Two Celtic languages of the United King-\ndom are now dead: Manx, the old language of the Isle of Man, and Cornish.\nManx died out after World War II, and Cornish disappeared at the end of the\neighteenth century, one date often cited being 1777, when the last known speaker,\nDorothy Pentreath of Mousehole, died. Many of the aboriginal languages of the\nAmericas are also dead. Latin is dead in this sense too for no one speaks it as\na native language; it exists only in a written form frozen in time, pronounced\nrather than spoken, and studied rather than used.\nOnce a language dies it is gone for all time and not even the so-called revival\nof Hebrew contradicts that assertion. Hebrew always existed in a spoken form\nas a liturgical language, as did Latin for centuries. Modern Hebrew is an out-\ngrowth of this liturgical variety. It is after all \u2018Modern\u2019 Hebrew and thenecessary\nsecularization of a liturgical language to make it serve the purposes of modern\nlife has not been an easy and uncontroversial matter. Many languages, while not\ndead yet, nevertheless are palpably dying: the number of people who speak them\ndiminishes drastically each year and the process seems irreversible, so that the\nAITC02 37 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 38 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nbest one can say of their vitality is that it is flagging. For example, the French\ndialects spoken in the Channel Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Sark are rapidly\non their way to extinction. Each year that passes brings a decrease in thenumber\nof languages spoken in the world (see pp. 378\u20139).\nWe should note that a language can remain a considerable force even after it\nis dead, that is, even after it is no longer spoken as anyone\u2019s first language and\nexists almost exclusively in one or more written forms, knowledge of which is\nacquired only through formal education. Classical Greek and Latin still have\nconsiderable prestige in the Western world, and speakers of many modern lan-\nguages continue to draw on them in a variety of ways. Sanskrit is important in\nthe same way to speakers of Hindi; Classical Arabic provides a unifying force\nand set of resources in the Islamic world; and Classical Chinese has consider-\nably influenced not only modern Chinese but also Japanese and Korean. Such\ninfluences cannot be ignored, because the speakers of languages subject to\nsuch influences are generally quite aware of what is happening: we can even say\nthat such influence is part of their knowledge of the language. We can also\nperiodically observe deliberate attempts to throw off an influence perceived to\nbe alien: for example, Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s largely successful attempt to reduce the Arabic\ninfluence on Turkish, and periodic attempts to \u2018purify\u2019 languages such as French\nand German of borrowings from English. While in the case of Hebrew, alanguage\nused only in a very restricted way for religious observances was successfully\nexpanded for everyday use, we should note that a similar attempt to revitalize\nGaelic in Ireland has been almost a complete failure.\nHistoricity refers to the fact that a particular group of people finds a sense of\nidentity through using a particular language: it belongs to them. Social, political,\nreligious, or ethnic ties may also be important for the group, but the bond\nprovided by a common language may prove to be the strongest tie of all. In the\nnineteenth century a German nation was unified around the German language\njust as in the previous century Russians had unified around a revitalized Russian\nlanguage. Historicity can be long-standing: speakers of the different varieties of\ncolloquial Arabic make much of a common linguistic ancestry, as obviously do\nspeakers of Chinese. It can also, as with Hebrew, be appealed to as a unifying\nforce among a threatened people.\nAutonomy is an interesting concept because it is really one of feeling. Alanguage\nmust be felt by its speakers to be different from other languages. However, this\nis a very subjective criterion. Ukrainians say their language is quite different\nfrom Russian and deplored its Russification when they were part of the Soviet\nUnion. Some speakers of African American Vernacular English (see chapter 14)\nmaintain that their language is not a variety of English but is a separatelanguage\nin its own right and refer to it as Ebonics. In contrast, speakers of Cantoneseand\nMandarin deny that they speak different languages: they maintain thatCantonese\nand Mandarin are not autonomous languages but are just two dialects ofChinese.\nAs we will see (chapter 3), creole and pidgin languages cause us not a fewproblems\nwhen we try to apply this criterion: how autonomous are such languages?\nReduction refers to the fact that a particular variety may be regarded as a\nsub-variety rather than as an independent entity. Speakers of Cockney will\nalmost certainly say that they speak a variety of English, admit that they are not\nAITC02 38 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 39\nrepresentative speakers of English, and recognize the existence of other varieties\nwith equivalent subordinate status. Sometimes the reduction is in the kinds of\nopportunities afforded to users of the variety. For example, there may be areduc-\ntion of resources; that is, the variety may lack a writing system. Or there may\nbe considerable restrictions in use; e.g., pidgin languages are very much reduced\nin the functions they serve in society in contrast to standardized languages.\nMixture refers to feelings speakers have about the \u2018purity\u2019 of the variety they\nspeak. This criterion appears to be more important to speakers of somelanguages\nthan of others, e.g., more important to speakers of French and German than to\nspeakers of English. However, it partly explains why speakers of pidgins andcreoles\nhave difficulty in classifying what they speak as full languages: these varieties\nare, in certain respects, quite obviously \u2018mixed,\u2019 and the people who speak them\noften feel that the varieties are neither one thing nor another, but rather aredebased,\ndeficient, degenerate, or marginal varieties of some other standard language.\nFinally, having de facto norms refers to the feeling that many speakers have\nthat there are both \u2018good\u2019 speakers and \u2018poor\u2019 speakers and that the good\nspeakers represent the norms of proper usage. Sometimes this means focusing on\none particular sub-variety as representing the \u2018best\u2019 usage, e.g., Parisian French\nor the Florentine variety of Italian. Standards must not only be established (by\nthe first criterion above), they must also be observed. When all the speakers of\na language feel that it is badly spoken or badly written almost everywhere, that\nlanguage may have considerable difficulty in surviving; in fact, such a feeling is\noften associated with a language that is dying. Concern with the norms of\nlinguistic behavior, \u2018linguistic purism\u2019 (see Thomas, 1991), may become very\nimportant among specific segments of society. For example, so far as English is\nconcerned, there is a very profitable industry devoted to telling people how they\nshould behave linguistically, what it is \u2018correct\u2019 to say, what to avoid saying, and\nso on (see Baron, 1982, Cameron, 1995, and Wardhaugh, 1999). As we will see\n(chapters 7\u20138), people\u2019s feelings about norms have important consequences for\nan understanding of both variation and change in language.\nIf we apply the above criteria to the different varieties of speech we observein\nthe world, we will see that not every variety we may want to call a languagehas\nthe same status as every other variety. English is a language, but so are Dogrib,\nHaitian Creole, Ukrainian, Latin, Tok Pisin, and Chinese. Each satisfies a differ-\nent sub-set of criteria from our list. Although there are important differences\namong them, we would be loath to deny that any one of them is a language.They\nare all equals as languages, but that does not necessarily mean that all languages\nare equal! The first is a linguistic judgment, the second a social one.\nAs we have just seen, trying to decide whether something is or is not alanguage\nor in what ways languages are alike and different can be quite troublesome.\nHowever, we usually experience fewer problems of the same kind with regard\nto dialects. There is usually little controversy over the fact that they are either\nregional or social varieties of something that is widely acknowledged to be a\nlanguage. That is true even of the relationship of Cantonese and Mandarin to\nChinese if the latter is given a \u2018generous\u2019 interpretation as a language.\nSome people are also aware that the standard variety of any language is\nactually only the preferred dialect of that language: Parisian French, Florentine\nAITC02 39 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 40 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nItalian, or the Zanzibar variety of Swahili in Tanzania. It is the variety that has\nbeen chosen for some reason, perhaps political, social, religious, or economic,\nor some combination of reasons, to serve as either the model or norm for other\nvarieties. It is the empowered variety. As a result, the standard is often not called\na dialect at all, but is regarded as the language itself. It takes on an ideological\ndimension and becomes the \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018proper\u2019 language of the group of people,\nthe very expression of their being. One consequence is that all other varieties\nbecome related to that standard and are regarded as dialects of that standard\nwith none of the power of that standard. Of course, this process usually involves\na complete restructuring of the historical facts. If language X1 differentiates in\nthree areas to become dialects XA, XB, and XC, and then XA is elevated to\nbecome a later standard X2, then XB, and XC are really historical variants of\nX1, not sub-varieties of X2. What happens in practice is that XB and XCundergo\npressure to change toward X2, and X2, the preferred variety or standard, exerts\nits influence over the other varieties.\nWe see a good instance of this process in Modern English. The new standard\nis based on the dialect of the area surrounding London, which was just one of\nseveral dialects of Old English, and not the most important for both the western\nand northern dialects were once at least equally as important. However, in the\nmodern period, having provided the base for Standard English, this dialect\nexerts a strong influence over all the other dialects of England so that it is not\njust first among equals but rather represents the modern language itself to the\nextent that the varieties spoken in the west and north are generally regarded as\nits local variants. Historically, these varieties arise from different sources, but\nnow they are viewed only in relation to the standardized variety.\nA final comment seems called for with regard to the terms language and\ndialect. A dialect is a subordinate variety of a language, so that we can say that\nTexas English and Swiss German are, respectively, dialects of English andGerman.\nThe language name (i.e., English or German) is the superordinate term. We can\nalso say of some languages that they contain more than one dialect; e.g.,English,\nFrench, and Italian are spoken in various dialects. If a language is spoken by so\nfew people, or so uniformly, that it has only one variety, we might be tempted\nto say that language and dialect become synonymous in such a case. However,\nanother view is that it is inappropriate to use dialect in such a situation because\nthe requirement of subordination is not met. Consequently, to say that we have\ndialect A of language X must imply also the existence of dialect B of language\nX, but to say we have language Y is to make no claim about the number of\ndialect varieties in which it exists: it may exist in only a single variety, or it may\nhave two (or more) subordinate dialects: dialects A, B, and so on.\nFinally, two other terms are important in connection with some of the issues\ndiscussed above: vernacular and koin\u00e9. Petyt (1980, p. 25) defines the former\nas \u2018the speech of a particular country or region,\u2019 or, more technically, \u2018a form\nof speech transmitted from parent to child as a primary medium of commun-\nication.\u2019 If that form of speech is Standard English, then Standard English is\nthe vernacular for that particular child; if it is a regional dialect, then that dia-\nlect is the child\u2019s vernacular. A koin\u00e9 is \u2018a form of speech shared by people of\ndifferent vernaculars \u2013 though for some of them the koin\u00e9 itself may be their\nAITC02 40 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 41\nvernacular.\u2019 A koin\u00e9 is a common language, but not necessarily a standard one.\nPetyt\u2019s examples of koin\u00e9s are Hindi for many people in India and Vulgar Latin\n(vulgar: \u2018colloquial\u2019 or \u2018spoken\u2019) in the Roman Empire. The original koin\u00e9 was,\nof course, the Greek koin\u00e9 of the Ancient World, a unified version of the Greek\ndialects, which after Alexander\u2019s conquests (circa 330 bce) became the lingua\nfranca of the Western world, a position it held until it was eventually super-\nseded, not without a struggle, by Vulgar Latin.\nDiscussion\n1. A survey of the following kind might prove quite revealing. Ask a variety\nof people you know questions such as these, and then try to organize their\nresponses in a systematic way:\na. Which language(s) do you speak?\nb. Do you speak a dialect of X?\nc. Where is the best X spoken?\nd. What is your native language (or mother tongue)?\ne. Do you speak X with an accent? If so, what accent?\nTry also to get definitions from your informants for each of the terms that\nyou use.\n2. A question found on many national census forms concerns the language or\nlanguages spoken (or known). It may ask respondents either to check one\nor more language names or to volunteer a name or names. What problems\ndo you see in collecting data in such a way? Think of countries like China,\nthe United States, Canada, India, France, Spain, and Norway.\n3. Is Afrikaans a dialect of Dutch or a different language? To attempt ananswer\nto this question you will have to consider a variety of issues: What is the\norigin of Afrikaans? Are Afrikaans and Dutch mutually intelligible? How\ndifferent are the orthographies (i.e., systems of spelling), sounds,vocabularies,\nand grammars? How important is the factor of the national consciousness\nof those who speak Afrikaans? Is the initial question clearly answerable\nfrom the kinds of theories and data that are currently available to us?\n4. Speakers of Faroese are said to understand speakers of Icelandic but not\nvice versa. Danes seem to understand Norwegians better than Norwegians\nunderstand Danes. Monolingual speakers of Mandarin and Cantonese can-\nnot communicate with each other in speech. What do such facts have to\nsay about using the criterion of mutual intelligibility in deciding whether\nwe are dealing with a single language, with two dialects of one language,\nor with two separate languages? Consider the following pieces of evidence\nin arriving at your answer. Speakers of Isoko in Nigeria say they cannot\nunderstand those who speak other Urhobo languages\/dialects; but these\nothers apparently understand them. This situation seems to have devel-\noped concurrently with demands for greater political autonomy and ethnic\nself-sufficiency.\nAITC02 41 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 42 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\n5. Standard languages are usually based on an existing dialect of thelanguage.\nFor example, the British variety of English is based, historically at least,\non the dialect of the area surrounding London, Continental French on the\ndialect of Paris, and Italian on the dialect of Florence or Tuscany (although\nRome and Milan became important influences in the late twentiethcentury).\nIn other countries the situation is not so clear-cut. What can you find out\nabout the difficulties of choosing a variety for standardization in Denmark,\nIndonesia, Greece, China, Haiti, and the Arab world?\n6. Old English, the language spoken a thousand years ago in England, was\na west-country variety of English, West Saxon. The court was located at\nWinchester and the literature and documents of the period were written in\nWest Saxon (or sometimes in Latin). By 1400 the English court was well\nestablished in London, which became the center of social, political, and\neconomic power. It also became the literary center of the country, particu-\nlarly after the development of printing. The variety of English spoken in\nand around London, including Oxford and Cambridge (which wereimport-\nant intellectual centers), became predominant. How would you use facts\nsuch as these to argue that no variety of a language is intrinsically better\nthan another and that what happens to a language is largely the result of\nthe chance interplay of external forces? Can you think of other examples\nwhich might support such a conclusion?\n7. Mencken wrote a series of books under the general title TheAmerican\nLanguage. Why did he choose this particular title? Why not The English\nLanguage in America? If the English of the United States is properlyregarded\nas a separate language, how about the varieties found in Canada,Australia,\nSouth Africa, and Singapore? You might read Lilles (2000) for a strongly\nexpressed dismissal of \u2018Canadian English,\u2019 as a \u2018fiction [without] any value\nlinguistically, pragmatically, socially, or politically\u2019 (p. 9). (See Clyne, 1992,\nfor a discussion of what he calls \u2018pluricentric languages.\u2019)\n8. One of the goals Dr Johnson set himself in compiling his Dictionary of\n1755 was to \u2018fix,\u2019 i.e., standardize, English. What does Johnson say in the\nPreface to that dictionary about his success in meeting that goal?\n9. The publication in 1961 of Webster\u2019s Third New InternationalDictionary\ncaused a tremendous stir in North America, being regarded by many critics\nas an attack on prevailing language standards. What were the issues? (See\nSledd and Ebbitt, 1962, Finegan, 1980, and Wardhaugh, 1999.)\n10. Writing of the codification of Standard English, Leith (1997, pp. 56\u20137)\nsays that \u2018by analyzing \u201ccorrect\u201d usage in terms that only a tiny minority\nof educated people could command, the codifiers ensured that correctness\nremained the preserve of an elite. The usage of most people was wrong,\nprecisely because it was the usage of the majority.\u2019 There appear to be both\nadvantages and disadvantages to having a \u2018standard language.\u2019 Is it pos-\nsible to make an objective assessment of these? Or is any judgment inher-\nently ideological?\n11. If Scotland continues to devolve from England, what might this mean for\nthe variety of English spoken there?

Arabs have a particular historical view of Arabic and Turks of Turkish.\nTry to find out something about these views. How do they help Arabs and\nTurks to maintain their languages? Hindi and Urdu are now viewed as\nrather different by those who speak these languages. How is each language\nbeing reshaped to conform to these views?\n13. How would you evaluate each of the following languages according to\nthe criteria stated above (standardization, vitality, historicity, autonomy,\nreduction, mixture, and de facto norms); that is, for each criterion, does\nthe language possess the stated characteristic or lack it: Haitian Creole,\nProven\u00e7al, Singapore English, Old English, Pitcairnese, African American\nVernacular English, Tok Pisin, Cockney, Ukrainian, and the language of\nShakespeare\u2019s plays?\n14. Find out what you can about Basic English. In what ways is it a reduced\nform of Standard English? Do the kinds of reductions introduced intoBasic\nEnglish make it \u2018simpler\u2019 to learn and use? (You will have to define\u2018simpler.\u2019)\n15. From time to time certain users of languages such as French and German\nhave objected to borrowings, in particular borrowings from English. What\nAnglicisms have been objected to? What kinds of native resources have\nbeen suggested as suitable alternative sources of exploitation in order to\ndevelop and\/or purify the language? What motivates the objections?\n16. Some Chinese scholars are concerned with developing the vocabulary of\nChinese to make it usable for every kind of scientific and technical endeavor.\nThey reject the idea that such vocabulary should be borrowed from other\nlanguages. What do you think they hope to gain by doing this? Do they\nlose anything if they are successful?\n17. \u2018A language is a dialect with an army and a navy\u2019 is a well-known observa-\ntion. (Today we would add an \u2018airforce\u2019!) True? And, if so, what are the\nconsequences?\n18. In the UNESCO Courier of April, 2000, a writer makes the following\nobservation: \u2018Languages usually have a relatively short life span as well as\na very high death rate. Only a few, including Basque, Egyptian, Chinese,\nGreek, Hebrew, Latin, Persian, Sanskrit, and Tamil have lasted more than\n2000 years.\u2019 How is this statement at best a half-truth?\n19. Are the Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, and other national varieties\nof English \u2018new dialects\u2019 of English, or autonomous languages, or possibly\neven both? (See Hickey, 2004, Gordon et al., 2004, and Trudgill, 2004.)\nRegional Dialects\nRegional variation in the way a language is spoken is likely to provide one of\nthe easiest ways of observing variety in language. As you travel throughout a\nwide geographical area in which a language is spoken, and particularly if that\nlanguage has been spoken in that area for many hundreds of years, you are\nalmost certain to notice differences in pronunciation, in the choices and forms\nAITC02 43 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 44 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nof words, and in syntax. There may even be very distinctive local colorings in\nthe language which you notice as you move from one location to another. Such\ndistinctive varieties are usually called regional dialects of the language. As we\nsaw earlier (p. 28), the term dialect is sometimes used only if there is a strong\ntradition of writing in the local variety. Old English and to a lesser extentMiddle\nEnglish had dialects in this sense. In the absence of such a tradition of writing\nthe term patois may be used to describe the variety. However, many linguists\nwriting in English tend to use dialect to describe both situations and rarely, if\nat all, use patois as a scientific term. You are likely to encounter it only as a kind\nof anachronism, as in its use by Jamaicans, who often refer to the variety of\nEnglish spoken on the island as a \u2018patois.\u2019\nThe dialect\u2013patois distinction actually seems to make more sense in some\nsituations, e.g., France, than in others. In medieval France, a number oflanguages\nflourished and several were associated with strong literary traditions. However,\nas the language of Paris asserted itself from the fourteenth century on, these\ntraditions withered. Parisian French spread throughout France, and, even though\nthat spread is still not yet complete (as visits to such parts of France as Brittany,\nProvence, Corsica, and Alsace will confirm), it drastically reduced theimportance\nof the local varieties: they continue to exist largely in spoken forms only; they\nare disfavored socially and politically; they are merely patois to those who extol\nthe virtues of Standard French. However, even as these varieties have faded,\nthere have been countervailing moves to revive them as many younger residents\nof the areas in which they are spoken see them as strong indicators of identities\nthey wish to preserve.\nThere are some further interesting differences in the use of the terms dialect\nand patois (Petyt, 1980, pp. 24\u20135). Patois is usually used to describe only rural\nforms of speech; we may talk about an urban dialect, but to talk about an urban\npatois seems strange. Patois also seems to refer only to the speech of the lower\nstrata in society; again, we may talk about a middle-class dialect but not,\napparently, about a middle-class patois. Finally, a dialect usually has a wider\ngeographical distribution than a patois, so that, whereas regional dialect and\nvillage patois seem unobjectionable, the same cannot be said for regional patois\nand village dialect. However, as I indicated above, many Jamaicans refer to the\npopular spoken variety of Jamaican English as a patois rather than as a dialect.\nSo again the distinction is in no way an absolute one.\nThis use of the term dialect to differentiate among regional varieties of specific\nlanguages is perhaps more readily applicable to contemporary conditions in\nEurope and some other developed countries than it would have been in medieval\nor Renaissance Europe or today in certain other parts of the world, where it was\n(and still is) possible to travel long distances and, by making only small changes\nin speech from location to location, continue to communicate with theinhabitants.\n(You might have to travel somewhat slowly, however, because of the necessary\nlearning that would be involved!) It has been said that at one time a person\ncould travel from the south of Italy to the north of France in this manner. It is\nquite clear that such a person began the journey speaking one language and\nended it speaking something entirely different; however, there was no one point\nat which the changeover occurred, nor is there actually any way of determining\nAITC02 44 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 45\nhow many intermediate dialect areas that person passed through. For an intrigu-\ning empirical test of this idea, one using recent phonetic data from a continuum\nof Saxon and Franconian dialects in the Netherlands, see Heeringa and Nerbonne\n(2001). They conclude that the traveler \u2018perceives phonological distanceindirectly\u2019\n(p. 398) and that there are \u2018unsharp borders between dialect areas\u2019 (p. 399).\nSuch a situation is often referred to as a dialect continuum. What you have\nis a continuum of dialects sequentially arranged over space: A, B, C, D, and so\non. Over large distances the dialects at each end of the continuum may well\nbe mutually unintelligible, and also some of the intermediate dialects may be\nunintelligible with one or both ends, or even with certain other intermediate\nones. In such a distribution, which dialects can be classified together under one\nlanguage, and how many such languages are there? As I have suggested, such\nquestions are possibly a little easier to answer today in certain places than they\nonce were. The hardening of political boundaries in the modern world as a\nresult of the growth of states, particularly nation-states rather than multina-\ntional or multi-ethnic states, has led to the hardening of language boundaries.\nAlthough residents of territories on both sides of the Dutch\u2013German border\n(within the West Germanic continuum) or the French\u2013Italian border (within the\nWest Romance continuum) have many similarities in speech even today, they\nwill almost certainly tell you that they speak dialects of Dutch or German in the\none case and French or Italian in the other. Various pressures \u2013 political, social,\ncultural, and educational \u2013 serve to harden current state boundaries and to\nmake the linguistic differences among states more, not less, pronounced.Dialects\ncontinue therefore to disappear as national languages arise. They are subject to\ntwo kinds of pressure: one from within, to conform to a national standard, and\none from without, to become different from standards elsewhere.\nWhen a language is recognized as being spoken in different varieties, the issue\nbecomes one of deciding how many varieties and how to classify each variety.\nDialect geography is the term used to describe attempts made to map the distri-\nbutions of various linguistic features so as to show their geographical prov-\nenance. For example, in seeking to determine features of the dialects of English\nand to show their distributions, dialect geographers try to find answers to ques-\ntions such as the following. Is this an r-pronouncing area of English, as in words\nlike car and cart, or is it not? What past tense form of drink do speakers prefer?\nWhat names do people give to particular objects in the environment, e.g., elev-\nator or lift, petrol or gas, carousel or roundabout? Sometimes maps are drawn\nto show actual boundaries around such features, boundaries called isoglosses, so\nas to distinguish an area in which a certain feature is found from areas in which\nit is absent. When several such isoglosses coincide, the result is sometimes called\na dialect boundary. Then we may be tempted to say that speakers on one side\nof that boundary speak one dialect and speakers on the other side speak a\ndifferent dialect.\nAs we will see when we return once again to this topic in chapter 6, there are\nmany difficulties with this kind of work: finding the kinds of items that appear\nto distinguish one dialect from another; collecting data; drawing conclusions\nfrom the data we collect; presenting the findings; and so on. It is easy to see,\nhowever, how such a methodology could be used to distinguish British,American,\nAITC02 45 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 46 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nAustralian, and other varieties of English from one another as various dialects\nof one language. It could also be used to distinguish Cockney English fromTexas\nEnglish. But how could you use it to distinguish among the multifariousvarieties\nof English found in cities like New York and London? Or even among the\nvarieties we observe to exist in smaller, less complex cities and towns in which\nvarious people who have always resided there are acknowledged to speak dif-\nferently from one another?\nFinally, the term dialect, particularly when it is used in reference to regional\nvariation, should not be confused with the term accent. Standard English, for\nexample, is spoken in a variety of accents, often with clear regional and social\nassociations: there are accents associated with North America, Singapore, India,\nLiverpool (Scouse), Tyneside (Geordie), Boston, New York, and so on. However,\nmany people who live in such places show a remarkable uniformity to oneanother\nin their grammar and vocabulary because they speak Standard English and the\ndifferences are merely those of accent, i.e., how they pronounce what they say.\nOne English accent has achieved a certain eminence, the accent known as\nReceived Pronunciation (or RP), the accent of perhaps as few as 3 percent of\nthose who live in England. (The \u2018received\u2019 in Received Pronunciation is a little\nbit of old-fashioned snobbery: it means the accent allows one to be received into\nthe \u2018better\u2019 parts of society!) This accent is of fairly recent origin (see Mugglestone,\n1995), becoming established as prestigious only in the late nineteenth century\nand not even given its current label until the 1920s. In the United Kingdom at\nleast, it is \u2018usually associated with a higher social or educational background,\nwith the BBC and the professions, and [is] most commonly taught to students\nlearning English as a foreign language\u2019 (Wakelin, 1977, p. 5). For many such\nstudents it is the only accent they are prepared to learn, and a teacher who does\nnot use it may have difficulty in finding a position as a teacher of English in\ncertain non-English-speaking countries in which a British accent is preferred over\na North American one. In fact, those who use this accent are often regarded as\nspeaking \u2018unaccented\u2019 English because it lacks a regional association within\nEngland. Other names for this accent are the Queen\u2019s English, Oxford English,\nand BBC English. However, there is no unanimous agreement that the Queen\ndoes in fact use RP, a wide variety of accents can be found among the staff and\nstudents at Oxford University, and regional accents are now widely used in the\nvarious BBC services. As Bauer (1994, pp. 115\u201321) also shows, RP continues to\nchange. One of its most recent manifestations has been labeled \u2018Estuary English\u2019\n(Rosewarne, 1994) \u2013 sometimes also called \u2018Cockneyfied RP\u2019 \u2013 a development\nof RP along the lower reaches of the Thames reflecting a power shift in London\ntoward the world of finance, banking, and commerce and away from that of\ninherited position, the Church, law, and traditional bureaucracies. Trudgill (1995,\np. 7) has pointed out what he considers to be the most interesting characteristics\nof RP: \u2018the relatively very small numbers of speakers who use it do not identify\nthemselves as coming from any particular geographical region\u2019; \u2018RP is largely\nconfined to England\u2019 and there it is a \u2018non-localized accent\u2019; and \u2018it is...not\nnecessary to speak RP to speak Standard English\u2019 because \u2018Standard English can\nbe spoken with any regional accent, and in the vast majority of cases normally\nis.\u2019 It is also interesting to observe that the 1997 English PronouncingDictionary\nAITC02 46 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 47\npublished by Cambridge University Press abandoned the label RP in favor of\nBBC English even though this latter term is not unproblematic as the BBC itself\nhas enlarged the accent pool from which it draws its newsreaders.\nThe development of Estuary English is one part of a general leveling ofaccents\nwithin the British Isles. The changes are well documented; see, for example,\nFoulkes and Docherty (1999), who review a variety of factors involved in the\nchanges that are occurring in cities. One feature of Estuary English, the use of\na glottal stop for t (Fabricus, 2002), is also not unique to that variety but is\nspreading widely, for example to Newcastle, Cardiff, and Glasgow, and even as\nfar north as rural Aberdeenshire in northeast Scotland (Marshall, 2003). Watt\n(2000, 2002) used the vowels in face and goat to show that Geordie, theNewcastle\naccent, levels toward a regional accent norm rather than toward a national one,\nalmost certainly revealing a preference for establishing a regional identity rather\nthan either a very limited local identity or a wider national one.\nThe most generalized accent in North America is sometimes referred to as\nGeneral American or, more recently, as network English, the accent associated\nwith announcers on the major television networks. Other languages often have\nno equivalent to RP: for example, German is spoken in a variety of accents,\nnone of which is deemed inherently any better than any other. Educated regional\nvarieties are preferred rather than some exclusive upper-class accent that has no\nclear relationship to personal achievement.\nAs a final observation I must reiterate that it is impossible to speak English\nwithout an accent. There is no such thing as an \u2018unaccented English.\u2019 RP is an\naccent, a social one rather than a regional one. However, we must note thatthere\nare different evaluations of the different accents, evaluations arising from social\nfactors not linguistic ones. Matsuda (1991, p. 1361) says it is really an issue of\npower: \u2018When...parties are in a relationship of domination and subordination\nwe tend to say that the dominant is normal, and the subordinate is different\nfrom normal. And so it is with accent....People in power are perceived as\nspeaking normal, unaccented English. Any speech that is different from that\nconstructed norm is called an accent.\u2019 In the pages that follow we will return\nconstantly to linguistic issues having to do with power.\nDiscussion\n1.

How might you employ a selection of items from the above questions (or\nsimilar items) to compile a checklist that could be used to determine the\ngeographical (and possibly social) origins of a speaker of English?\n8. A local accent may be either positively or negatively valued. How do you\nvalue each of the following: a Yorkshire accent; a Texas accent; the accents\nof the Queen of England, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and\nthe President of the United States? Think of some others. Why do youreact\nthe way you do? Is it a question of being able to identify with the speaker\nor not; of social class; of education; or stereotyping; or what? How appro-\npriate would each of the following be: RP in a Tyneside working-class pub;\nnetwork English at a Black Power rally in Harlem; and Parisian French at\na hockey game at the Montreal Forum?\n9. A. S. C. Ross, in Noblesse Oblige (Mitford, 1956), a book which discusses\nsomewhat lightheartedly, but not un-seriously, differences between \u2018U\u2019\n(upper-class) and \u2018non-U\u2019 (not upper-class) speech in the United Kingdom,\nobserves (pp. 75\u20136):\nMany (but not all) U-speakers make get rhyme with bit, just (adverb) with\nbest, catch with fetch....U-speakers do not sound the l in golf, Ralph\n(which rhymes with safe), solder; some old-fashioned U-speakers do not\nsound it in falcon, Malvern, either, but it is doubtful how far this last\nsurvives....\nReal, ideal have two, respectively, three syllables in U speech, one, respect-\nively, two in non-U speech (note, especially, non-U really, rhyming with\nmealie)....Some U-speakers pronounce tyre and tar identically (and so for\nmany other words, such as fire \u2013 even going to the length of making lion\nrhyme with barn).\nAITC02 48 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 49\nRoss makes numerous other observations about differences between the\ntwo varieties. Do you consider such differences to be useful, unnecessary,\nsnobbish, undemocratic, inevitable, or what?\n10. There may have been a recent fall-off in the high social prestige associated\nwith RP in England and elsewhere. How might you establish whether such\nis the case?\n11. Differences in the accent one uses to speak a standard variety of a lan-\nguage may be more important in some parts of the world than others. Are\ndifferences in accent as important within the United States, Canada, and\nAustralia as they appear to be in the British Isles? Do speakers of German\nfrom Hanover, Berlin, Vienna, and Z\u00fcrich view differences in German\naccent in the same way as speakers of English? What factors appear to\naccount for the different evaluations of accents?\n12. The fact that Standard English can be spoken with a variety of accents\noften poses certain difficulties for the teaching of English in non-English-\nspeaking countries. What are some of the problems you might encounter\nand how might you try to solve them?\n13. Preston (1989) has demonstrated that speakers of English (in this case\nin the United States) have certain perceptions about regional varieties of\nEnglish other than their own, i.e., what they are like and how their own\nvariety differs. Try to describe what you believe to be the characteristics\nof another variety of English and then check out the facts. Try to account\nfor any differences you find between the two, between beliefs and facts.\n(See also Preston, 1999, 2002, and Long and Preston, 2003.)\nSocial Dialects\nThe term dialect can also be used to describe differences in speech associated\nwith various social groups or classes. There are social dialects as well as regional\nones. An immediate problem is that of defining social group (see chapter 5)\nor social class (see chapter 6), giving proper weight to the various factors that\ncan be used to determine social position, e.g., occupation, place of residence,\neducation, \u2018new\u2019 versus \u2018old\u2019 money, income, racial or ethnic origin, cultural\nbackground, caste, religion, and so on. Such factors as these do appear to be\nrelated fairly directly to how people speak. There is a British \u2018public-school\u2019\ndialect, and there is an \u2018African American Vernacular English\u2019 dialect found in\ncities such as New York, Detroit, and Buffalo. Many people also havestereotypical\nnotions of how other people speak, and, as we will see in chapter 7 in particular,\nthere is considerable evidence from work of investigators such as Labov and\nTrudgill that social dialects can indeed be described systematically.\nWhereas regional dialects are geographically based, social dialects originate\namong social groups and are related to a variety of factors, the principal ones\napparently being social class, religion, and ethnicity. In India, for example, caste,\none of the clearest of all social differentiators, quite often determines which\nAITC02 49 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 50 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nvariety of a language a speaker uses. In a city like Baghdad the Christian,\nJewish, and Muslim inhabitants speak different varieties of Arabic. In this case\nthe first two groups use their variety solely within the group but the Muslim\nvariety serves as a lingua franca, or common language, among the groups.\nConsequently, Christians and Jews who deal with Muslims must use twovarieties:\ntheir own at home and the Muslim variety for trade and in all inter-group\nrelationships. Ethnic variation can be seen in the United States, where onevariety\nof English has become so identified with an ethnic group that it is often referred\nto as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Labov\u2019s work in New York\nCity shows that there are other ethnic differences too: speakers of Jewish and\nItalian ethnicity differentiate themselves from speakers of either the standard\nvariety or AAVE. On occasion they actually show hypercorrective tendencies in\nthat they tend to overdo certain imitative behaviors: Italians are inclined to be\nin the vanguard of pronouncing words like bad and bag with a vowelresembling\nthat of beard and Jews in the vanguard of pronouncing words like dog with a\nvowel something like that of book. A possible motivation for such behavior is\na desire to move away from the Italian and Yiddish vowels that speakers could\nso easily use in these words but which would be clear ethnic markers; however,\nthe movement prompted by such avoidance behavior goes beyond the prevailing\nlocal norm and becomes an ethnic characteristic that serves as an indicator of\nidentity and solidarity.\nStudies in social dialectology, the term used to refer to this branch of linguistic\nstudy, confront many difficult issues, particularly when investigators venture\ninto cities. Cities are much more difficult to characterize linguistically than are\nrural hamlets; variation in language and patterns of change are much more\nobvious in cities, e.g., in family structures, employment, and opportunities for\nsocial advancement or decline. Migration, both in and out of cities, is alsousually\na potent linguistic factor. Cities also spread their influence far beyond their\nlimits and their importance should never be underestimated in considering such\nmatters as the standardization and diffusion of languages.\nIn later chapters (particularly chapters 6\u20138) we will look closely at the import-\nance of language variation in cities and see how important such variation is in\ntrying to understand how and why change occurs in languages. In this way we\nmay also come to appreciate why some sociolinguists regard such variation as\nbeing at the heart of work in sociolinguistics.\nDiscussion\n1. Gumperz (1968) maintains that separate languages maintain themselves most\nreadily in closed tribal systems in which kinship dominates all activities;\non the other hand, distinctive varieties arise in highly stratified societies.\nHe points out that, when social change causes the breakdown of traditional\nsocial structures and the formation of new ties, linguistic barriers between\nvarieties also break down. Can you think of any examples which either\nconfirm or disconfirm this claim?\nAITC02 50 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 51\n2. If some social dialects may properly be labeled nonstandard, Labov (1970,\np. 52) raises a very important issue in connection with finding speakers who\ncan supply reliable data concerning such varieties. He says:\nWe have not encountered any non-standard speakers who gained good control\nof a standard language, and still retained control of the non-standard verna-\ncular. Dialect differences depend upon low-level rules which appear as minor\nadjustments and extensions of contextual conditions, etc. It appears that such\nconditions inevitably interact, and, although the speaker may indeed appear\nto be speaking the vernacular, close examination of his speech shows that his\ngrammar has been heavily influenced by the standard. He may succeed in\nconvincing his listeners that he is speaking the vernacular, but this impression\nseems to depend upon a number of unsystematic and heavily marked signals.\nIf Labov\u2019s observation is correct, what must we do to gain access to any\ninformation we seek about \u2018the non-standard vernacular\u2019? What difficulties\ndo you foresee?\n3. How are language norms established and perpetuated in rather isolated\nrural communities, e.g., a small village in the west of England, or in north-\nern Vermont, or in the interior of British Columbia? How different do you\nthink the situation is in London, New York, or Vancouver? Are there any\nsimilarities at all? How are language norms established overall in England,\nthe United States, and Canada?\nStyles, Registers, and Beliefs\nThe study of dialects is further complicated by the fact that speakers can adopt\ndifferent styles of speaking. You can speak very formally or very informally,\nyour choice being governed by circumstances. Ceremonial occasions almost\ninvariably require very formal speech, public lectures somewhat less formal,\ncasual conversation quite informal, and conversations between intimates on\nmatters of little importance may be extremely informal and casual. (See Joos,\n1962, for an entertaining discussion.) We may try to relate the level of formality\nchosen to a variety of factors: the kind of occasion; the various social, age, and\nother differences that exist between the participants; the particular task that is\ninvolved, e.g., writing or speaking; the emotional involvement of one or more\nof the participants; and so on. We appreciate that such distinctions exist when\nwe recognize the stylistic appropriateness of What do you intend to do, your\nmajesty? and the inappropriateness of Waddya intend doin\u2019, Rex? While it may\nbe difficult to characterize discrete levels of formality, it is nevertheless possible\nto show that native speakers of all languages control a range of stylistic vari-\neties. It is also quite possible to predict with considerable confidence the stylistic\nfeatures that a native speaker will tend to employ on certain occasions. We will\nreturn to related issues in chapters 4, 7, and 11.\nAITC02 51 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 52 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\nRegister is another complicating factor in any study of language varieties.\nRegisters are sets of language items associated with discrete occupational or\nsocial groups. Surgeons, airline pilots, bank managers, sales clerks, jazz fans,\nand pimps employ different registers. As Ferguson (1994, p. 20) says, \u2018People\nparticipating in recurrent communication situations tend to develop similar\nvocabularies, similar features of intonation, and characteristic bits of syntax\nand phonology that they use in these situations.\u2019 This kind of variety is aregister.\nFerguson adds that its \u2018special terms for recurrent objects and events, and for-\nmulaic sequences or \u201croutines,\u201d seem to facilitate speedy communication; other\nfeatures apparently serve to mark the register, establish feelings of rapport,\nand serve other purposes similar to the accommodation that influences dialect\nformation. There is no mistaking the strong tendency for individuals and co-\ncommunicators to develop register variation along many dimensions.\u2019 Of course,\none person may control a variety of registers: you can be a stockbroker and an\narcheologist, or a mountain climber and an economist. Each register helps you\nto express your identity at a specific time or place, i.e., how you seek to present\nyourself to others.\nDialect, style, and register differences are largely independent: you can talk\ncasually about mountain climbing in a local variety of a language, or you can\nwrite a formal technical study of wine making. You may also be judged to speak\n\u2018better\u2019 or \u2018worse\u2019 than other speakers who have much the same background. It\nis quite usual to find some people who are acknowledged to speak a language\nor one of its varieties better or worse than others. In an article on the varieties\nof speech he found among the 1,700 or so speakers of Menomini, anAmerindian\nlanguage of Wisconsin, Bloomfield (1927) mentioned a variety of skills that\nwere displayed among some of the speakers he knew best: a woman in her\nsixties who spoke \u2018a beautiful and highly idiomatic Menomini\u2019; her husband,\nwho used \u2018forms which are current among bad speakers\u2019 on some occasions and\n\u2018elevated speech,\u2019 incorporating forms best described as \u2018spellingpronunciations,\u2019\n\u2018ritualistic compound words and occasional archaisms\u2019 on others; an old man\nwho \u2018spoke with bad syntax and meagre, often inept vocabulary, yet with\noccasional archaisms\u2019; a man of about forty with \u2018atrocious\u2019 Menomini, i.e.,\na small vocabulary, barbarous inflections, threadbare sentences; and two half-\nbreeds, one who spoke using a vast vocabulary and the other who employed\n\u2018racy idiom.\u2019\nValue judgments of this kind sometimes emerge for reasons that are hard to\nexplain. For example, there appears to be a subtle bias built into the way people\ntend to judge dialects. Quite often, though not always, people seem to exhibit\na preference for rural dialects over urban ones. In England the speech of North-\numbria seems more highly valued than the speech of Tyneside and certainly\nthe speech of Liverpool seems less valued than that of northwest England as a\nwhole. In North America the speech of upstate New York does not have the\nnegative characteristics associated with much of the speech of New York City.\nWhy such different attitudes should exist is not easy to say. Is it a preference for\nthings that appear to be \u2018older\u2019 and \u2018more conservative,\u2019 a subconscious dislike\nof some of the characteristics of urbanization, including uncertainty about what\nstandards should prevail, or some other reason or reasons?\nAITC02 52 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 53\nSometimes these notions of \u2018better\u2019 and \u2018worse\u2019 solidify into those of \u2018correct-\nness\u2019 and \u2018incorrectness.\u2019 We may well heed Bloomfield\u2019s words (1927, pp. 432\u2013\n3) concerning the latter notions:\nThe popular explanation of \u2018correct\u2019 and \u2018incorrect\u2019 speech reduces the matter to\none of knowledge versus ignorance. There is such a thing as correct English. An\nignorant person does not know the correct forms; therefore he cannot help using\nincorrect ones. In the process of education one learns the correct forms and, by\npractice and an effort of will (\u2018careful speaking\u2019), acquires the habit of using them.\nIf one associates with ignorant speakers, or relaxes the effort of will (\u2018careless\nspeaking\u2019), one will lapse into the incorrect forms...there is one error in the\npopular view which is of special interest. The incorrect forms cannot be the\nresult of ignorance or carelessness, for they are by no means haphazard, but, on\nthe contrary, very stable. For instance, if a person is so ignorant as not to know\nhow to say I see it in past time, we might expect him to use all kinds of chance\nforms, and, especially, to resort to easily formed locutions, such as I did see it, or\nto the addition of the regular past-time suffix: I seed it. But instead, these ignorant\npeople quite consistently say I seen it. Now it is evident that one fixed and con-\nsistent form will be no more difficult than another: a person who has learned I seen\nas the past of I see has learned just as much as one who says I saw. He has simply\nlearned something different. Although most of the people who say I seen are\nignorant, their ignorance does not account for this form of speech.\nMany people hold strong beliefs on various issues having to do with language\nand are quite willing to offer their judgments on issues (see Bauer and Trudgill,\n1998, Niedzielski and Preston, 1999, and Wardhaugh, 1999). They believe such\nthings as certain languages lack grammar, that you can speak English without\nan accent, that French is more logical than English, that parents teach their\nchildren to speak, that primitive languages exist, that English is degenerating\nand language standards are slipping, that pronunciation should be based on\nspelling, and so on and so on. Much discussion of language matters in the media\nconcerns such \u2018issues\u2019 and there are periodic attempts to \u2018clean up\u2019 various bits\nand pieces, attempts that Cameron (1995) calls \u2018verbal hygiene.\u2019 Most linguists\nstudiously avoid getting involved in such issues having witnessed the failure of\nvarious attempts to influence received opinions on such matters. As I have\nwritten elsewhere (1999, p. viii), \u2018Linguists...know that many popular beliefs\nabout language are false and that much we are taught about language is mis-\ndirected. They also know how difficult it is to effect change.\u2019 Language beliefs\nare well entrenched as are language attitudes and language behaviors. Sociolin-\nguists should strive for an understanding of all three because all affect how\npeople behave toward others.\nAs we have seen, many varieties of language exist and each language exists\nin a number of guises. However, languages do not vary in every possible way.\nIt is still quite possible to listen to an individual speaker and infer very specific\nthings about that speaker after hearing relatively little of his or her speech. The\ninteresting problem is accounting for our ability to do that. What are the specific\nlinguistic features we rely on to classify a person as being from a particular\nplace, a member of a certain social class, a representative of a specificprofession,\nAITC02 53 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM 54 Languages, Dialects, and Varieties\na social climber, a person pretending to be someone he or she is not, and so on?\nOne possible hypothesis is that we rely on relatively few cues, e.g., the presence\nor absence of certain linguistic features. We are also sensitive to the consistency\nor inconsistency in the use of these cues, so that on occasion it is not just that\na particular linguistic feature is always used but that it is used such and such\na percent of the time rather than exclusively or not at all (see chapter 7).\nHowever, we may actually perceive its use or non-use to be categorical, i.e.,\nthe feature to be totally present or totally absent. This last hypothesis is an\ninteresting one in that it raises very important questions about the linguistic\ncapabilities of human beings, particularly about how individuals acquire the\nability to use language in such ways. If you must learn to use both linguistic\nfeature X (e.g., -ing endings on verbs) and linguistic feature Y (e.g., -in\u2019 endings\non verbs) and how to use them in different proportions in situations A, B, C,\nand so on, what does that tell us about innate human abilities and the human\ncapacity for learning?\nThe existence of different varieties is interesting in still another respect.\nWhile each of us may have productive control over only a very few varieties of\na language, we can usually comprehend many more varieties and relate all of\nthese to the concept of a \u2018single language.\u2019 That is, our receptive linguistic ability\nis much greater than our productive linguistic ability. An interesting problem for\nlinguists is knowing how best to characterize this \u2018knowledge\u2019 that we have\nwhich enables us to recognize something as being in the language but yet marked\nas \u2018different\u2019 in some way. Is it part of our competence or part of our perform-\nance in the Chomskyan sense? Or is that a false dichotomy? The first question\nis as yet unanswered but, as the second suggests, it could possibly be unanswer-\nable. I will have more to say on such matters as we look further into the various\nrelationships between language and society.\nDiscussion\n1. When might each of the following sentences be stylistically appropriate?\na. Attention!\nb. I do hereby bequeath...\nc. Our Father, which art in Heaven...\nd. Been to see your Dad recently?\ne. Get lost!\nf. Now if we consider the relationship between social class and income...\ng. Come off it!\nh. Take care!\ni. Haven\u2019t we met somewhere before?\n2. What stylistic characteristics do you associate with each of the following\nactivities: talking to a young child; writing an essay for a professor; play-\ning a board game with a close friend; approaching a stranger on the street\nAITC02 54 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 55\nto ask for directions; attending a funeral; talking to yourself; getting stopped\nfor speeding; burning your finger?\n3. One of the easiest ways of persuading yourself that there are registers\nassociated with different occupations is to read materials associated with\ndifferent callings. You can quickly compile register differences from such\nsources as law reports, hairdressing or fashion magazines, scholarly jour-\nnals, recipe books, sewing patterns, instruction manuals, textbooks, and\nso on. The supply is almost inexhaustible! You might compile lists of\nwords from various sources and find out how long it takes one of your\nfellow students to identify the particular \u2018sources\u2019 as you read the lists\naloud.\n4. Hudson (1996, p. 46) says \u2018your dialect shows who (or what) you are,\nwhilst your register shows what you are doing.\u2019 He acknowledges that\n\u2018these concepts are much less distinct than the slogan implies\u2019; however,you\nmight use them to sort out what would be dialect and register for aprofessor\nof sociology from Mississippi; a hairdresser from Newcastle working in\nLondon; a British naval commander; a sheep farmer in New Zealand; and\na \u2018street-wise\u2019 person from any location you might choose.\n5. Wolfram and Fasold (1974, p. 20) offer the following working definitions\nof what they called standard, superstandard (or hypercorrect) and sub-\nstandard (or nonstandard) speech. They say of someone that:\nIf his reaction to the form (not the content) of the utterance is neutral and\nhe can devote full attention to the meaning, then the form is standard for\nhim. If his attention is diverted from the meaning of the utterance because\nit sounds \u2018snooty,\u2019 then the utterance is superstandard. If his attention is\ndiverted from the message because the utterance sounds like poor English,\nthen the form is substandard.\nWhat are your reactions to each of the following?\na. Am I not?\nb.

A person who insists on saying both between you and I\nand It\u2019s I? A person who uses malapropisms? A person who, in speaking\nrapidly in succession to a number of others, easily shifts from one variety\nof speech to another?\n7. What do you regard as the characteristics of a \u2018good\u2019 speaker of English\nand of a \u2018poor\u2019 speaker? Consider such matters as pronunciation, word\nchoice, syntactic choice, fluency, and style.\n8. There seems to be evidence that many people judge themselves to speak\n\u2018better\u2019 than they actually do, or, if not better, at least less casually than\nthey do. Do you know of any such evidence? If it is the case that people\ndo behave this way, why might it be so?\n9. Find some articles or books on \u2018good speaking,\u2019 on \u2018how to improve your\nspeech,\u2019 or on \u2018how to impress others through increasing your vocabulary,\u2019\nand so on. How valuable is the advice you find in such materials?\n10. If you had access to only a single style and\/or variety of language, what\ndifficulties do you think you might encounter in trying to express different\nlevels of formality as the social situation changed around you, or to indic-\nate such things as seriousness, mockery, humor, respect, and disdain? Is the\nkind of variation you need a resource that more than compensates for the\ndifficulties that result in teaching the language or arriving at someconsensus\nconcerning such concepts as \u2018correctness\u2019 or \u2018propriety\u2019?\n11. Hudson (1996, p. 21) says that \u2018lay people\u2019 sometimes ask linguists ques-\ntions such as \u2018Where is real Cockney spoken?\u2019 They assume such questions\nare meaningful. (Another is \u2018Is Jamaican creole a kind of English or not?\u2019)\nHudson says that such questions \u2018are not the kind of questions that can\nbe investigated scientifically.\u2019 Having read this chapter, can you think of\nsome other questions about language which are frequently asked but which\nmight also be similarly unanswerable? How about the following: Who\nspeaks the best English? Where should I go to learn perfect Italian? Why\ndo people write and talk so badly these days? Explain why each is unan-\nswerable \u2013 by a linguist at least!\n12. Cameron (1996, p. 36) includes the following practices under \u2018verbal\nhygiene\u2019: \u2018\u201cprescriptivism,\u201d that is, the authoritarian promotion of elite\nvarieties as norms of correctness,...campaigns for Plain English, spelling\nreform, dialect and language preservation, non-sexist and non-racist lan-\nguage, Esperanto and the abolition of the copula,...self-improvement\nactivities such as elocution and accent reduction, Neurolinguistic Program-\nming, assertiveness training and communication skills training.\u2019 Howhelpful\n\u2013 or harmful \u2013 do you consider such activities?\n13. Mugglestone (1995, p. 330) writes as follows: \u2018The process of standard-\nization...can and will only reach completion in a dead language, where\nthe inviolable norms so often asserted by the prescriptive tradition (and the\nabsolutes of language attitudes) may indeed come into being.\u2019 If variation\nsets limits to language standardization, why do some people still insist that\nrigid standards should be prescribed (and followed)?\nAITC02 56 5\/9\/05, 4:36 PM Languages, Dialects, and Varieties 57\nFurther Reading\nChambers and Trudgill (1998), Davis (1983), and Petyt (1980) provide intro-\nductions to the study of dialects.

To the bestof\nour knowledge all have existed since time immemorial, but, in comparison with\nwhat we know about many \u2018fully fledged\u2019 languages, we know comparatively\nlittle about them. There is a paucity of historical records; the history of serious\nstudy of such languages goes back only a few decades; and, because of the\ncircumstances of their use, they have often been regarded as being of little\nintrinsic value or interest. Until recently, pidgins and creoles have generally been\nviewed as uninteresting linguistic phenomena, being notable mainly forlinguistic\nfeatures they have been said to \u2018lack,\u2019 e.g., articles, the copula, and grammatical\ninflections, rather than those they possess, and those who speak them have often\nbeen treated with disdain, even contempt.\nHymes (1971, p. 3) has pointed out that before the 1930s pidgins and creoles\nwere largely ignored by linguists, who regarded them as \u2018marginal languages\u2019 at\nbest. (Some linguists were even advised to keep away from studying them lest\nthey jeopardize their careers!) He points out that pidgins and creoles \u2018are mar-\nginal, in the circumstances of their origin, and in the attitudes towards them on\nthe part of those who speak one of the languages from which they derive.\u2019 They\nare also marginal \u2018in terms of knowledge about them,\u2019 even though \u2018these lan-\nguages are of central importance to our understanding of language, and central\ntoo in the lives of some millions of people. Because of their origins, however,\ntheir association with poorer and darker members of a society, and through\nperpetuation of misleading stereotypes...most interest, even where positive,has\nconsidered them merely curiosities.\u2019 He adds that much \u2018interest and informa-\ntion, scholarly as well as public, has been prejudicial. These languages have been\nconsidered, not creative adaptations, but degenerations; not systems in their\nown right, but deviations from other systems. Their origins have been explained,\nnot by historical and social forces, but by inherent ignorance, indolence, and\ninferiority.\u2019 As languages of those without political and social power, literatures,\nand \u2018culture,\u2019 they could be safely and properly ignored, for what could they\npossibly tell us about anything that English and French or even Greek, Latin,\nand Sanskrit could not?\nFortunately, in recent years such attitudes have changed and, as seriousattention\nhas been given to pidgins and creoles, linguists have discovered many interesting\ncharacteristics about them, characteristics that appear to bear on fundamental\nAITC03 58 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 59\nissues to do with all languages, \u2018fully fledged\u2019 and \u2018marginal\u2019 alike. Moreover,\npidgins and creoles are invaluable to those who use them. Not only are they\nessential to everyday living but they are also frequently important markers of\nidentity. In an interview in 1978 a schoolboy in Belize had this to say about his\nlanguage: \u2018Well, usually in Belize you find the language, the main language you\nknow is this slang that I tell you about, the Creole. And you\u2019d recognize them\nby that, you know. They usually have this, you know, very few of them speak\nthe English or some of them usually speak Spanish\u2019 (Le Page and Tabouret-\nKeller, 1985, p. 216). The study of pidgins and creoles has become an important\npart of linguistic and, especially, sociolinguistic study, with its own literatureand,\nof course, its own controversies. With pidgins and creoles we can see processes\nof language origin and change going on around us. We can also witness how\npeople are attracted to languages, how they exploit what linguistic resources\nthey have, and how they forge new identities. We do not have to wait a millen-\nnium to see how a language changes; a few generations suffice. To some extent,\ntoo, the speakers of such languages have benefited as more and more of them\nhave come to recognize that what they speak is not just a \u2018bad\u2019 variety of this\nlanguage or that, but a language or a variety of a language with its own legit-\nimacy, i.e., its own history, structure, array of functions, and the possibility of\nwinning eventual recognition as a \u2018proper\u2019 language.\nLingua Francas\nPeople who speak different languages who are forced into contact with each\nother must find some way of communicating, a lingua franca. In a publication\nconcerned with the use of vernacular languages in education published in Paris\nin 1953, UNESCO defined a lingua franca as \u2018a language which is used habitu-\nally by people whose mother tongues are different in order to facilitate commun-\nication between them.\u2019 A variety of other terms can be found which describe\nmuch the same phenomenon. Samarin (1968, p. 661) lists four: a trade language\n(e.g., Hausa in West Africa or Swahili in East Africa); a contact language (e.g.,\nGreek koin\u00e9 in the Ancient World); an international language (e.g., English\nthroughout much of our contemporary world); and an auxiliary language (e.g.,\nEsperanto or Basic English). They usually develop as a consequence of popula-\ntion migration (forced or voluntary) or for purposes of trade. Still another kind\nof lingua franca is a mixed language. Bakker (1997) describes one suchlanguage,\nMichif, a mixture of Cree and French spoken mainly in Canada by well undera\nthousand people of m\u00e9tis (aboriginal and French) ancestry. Michif is sometimes\ncharacterized as a language that mixes Cree verbs and French nouns but prob-\nably more accurately is one that uses Cree grammar and French vocabulary. It\nis a clear marker of group identity for those who use it and emerged to express\n\u2018a new ethnic identity, mixed Cree and French. A new language was needed to\nexpress that identity. The most obvious way to form a new language was through\nmixing the two community languages, Cree and French\u2019 (Bakker and Papen,\nAITC03 59 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 60 Pidgins and Creoles\n1997, p. 355). Winford (2003, p. 206) adds that the Michif are an example of\n\u2018newly emerged social groups who wanted a language of their own...[and]who\nsaw themselves as distinct from either of the cultural groups from which they\ndescended.\u2019\nAt one time or another, Greek koin\u00e9 and Vulgar Latin were in widespread use\nas lingua francas in the Mediterranean world and much of Europe. Sabir was\na lingua franca of the Mediterranean (and later far beyond); originating in the\nMiddle Ages and dating back at least to the Crusades, it survived into the\ntwentieth century. In other parts of the world Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi, and\nSwahili have served, or do serve, as lingua francas. Of these, Arabic was a\nlingua franca associated with the spread of Islam. Today, English is used in very\nmany places and for very many purposes as a lingua franca, e.g., in travel and\noften in trade, commerce, and international relations (see pp. 379\u201380).\nA lingua franca can be spoken in a variety of ways. Although both Greek\nkoin\u00e9 and Vulgar Latin served at different times as lingua francas in the Ancient\nWorld, neither was a homogeneous entity. Not only were they spoken differently\nin different places, but individual speakers varied widely in their ability to use\nthe languages. English serves today as a lingua franca in many parts of theworld:\nfor some speakers it is a native language, for others a second language, and for\nstill others a foreign language. However, in the last two categories abilities in the\nlanguage may vary widely from native-like to knowledge of only some bare\nrudiments. This is certainly the case in India, where even though Hindi is the\nofficial language, English, spoken in all kinds of ways, is widely used as a lingua\nfranca. Swahili is a lingua franca of East Africa. On the coast it has long been\nspoken as a native language. As Swahili spread inland in Tanzania, it was sim-\nplified in structure, and even further inland, in Za\u00efre, it underwent still further\nsimplification. Such simplification was also accompanied by a reduction in func-\ntion, i.e., the simplified varieties were not used for as many purposes as thefuller\nvariety of the coast. In rural northern parts of Za\u00efre even more simplification\nresulted so that the Swahili spoken there became virtually unintelligible to coastal\nresidents. While the existence of this variety demonstrates that Swahili wasbeing\nused as a lingua franca, what many people were actually using was a pidginized\nform, Za\u00efre Pidgin Swahili. In this respect, those who used that variety were not\nunlike many today who use English as a lingua franca: they use local pidginized\nversions of English, not Standard English. Today, that Za\u00efre Pidgin English has\nbecome a creole, Restructured Swahili, and it is considerably different from the\nSwahili of the coast (see Holm, 1989, pp. 564\u20137).\nIn North America, Chinook Jargon was used extensively as a lingua franca\namong native peoples of the northwest, from British Columbia into Alaska,\nduring the second half of the nineteenth century. (\u2018Jargon\u2019 is one of the original\nderogatory terms for a pidgin.) Speakers of English and French also learned it.\nToday Chinook Jargon is virtually extinct. Its vocabulary came from various\nsources: principally, Nootka, Chinook, Chehalis (all Amerindian languages),\nFrench, and English. The sound system tended to vary according to the native\nlanguage of whoever spoke Chinook Jargon. The grammar, ostensibly Chinook,\nwas extremely reduced so that it is really quite difficult to say with conviction\nthat it is more Chinook than anything else. Even though today hardly anyone\nAITC03 60 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 61\ncan use Chinook Jargon, a few words from it have achieved limited use in\nEnglish: e.g., potlach (\u2018lavish gift-giving\u2019), cheechako (\u2018greenhorn\u2019), and possibly\nhigh mucky-muck (\u2018arrogant official\u2019) (see Taylor, 1981). There is an interesting\ndistributional relationship between Chinook Jargon and another lingua franca\nused widely by native peoples, Plains Sign Language: Chinook Jargon isbasically\na coastal phenomenon and Plains Sign Language an interior one on the plateau.\nHymes (1980, pp. 416\u201317) has observed that we do not know why the plateau\ndeveloped a sign language and the coast a jargon. Perhaps the reason wasslavery\nor the amount of slavery. The Chinook held slaves in considerable numbers,\nmostly obtained by purchases from surrounding peoples, but also secondarily\nthrough raiding parties. It seems likely that the slaves learned a reduced form\nof Chinook and that this reduced form was used between them and theirowners.\nAs we will see, it is in observations such as these that we may find clues as to\nthe origin and spread of pidgins and creoles and come to realize how important\nsocial factors have been in their development.\nDiscussion\n1. A particularly interesting lingua franca is Plains Sign Language used by\naboriginal peoples in North America (see Taylor, 1981, for a description of\nthis and other aboriginal lingua francas). Try to find out in what ways\nPlains Sign Language must be distinguished from American Sign Language,\ni.e., the communication system that many deaf people use.\n2. Esperanto and Basic English have both been proposed for use as auxiliary\nlanguages, i.e., as lingua francas. What advantages are claimed for each?\nDo you see any disadvantages? (There are numerous other proposals for\nauxiliary languages, so you might care to extend your inquiry to these\ntoo.)\nDefinitions\nA pidgin is a language with no native speakers: it is no one\u2019s first language but\nis a contact language. That is, it is the product of a multilingual situation in\nwhich those who wish to communicate must find or improvise a simplelanguage\nsystem that will enable them to do so. Very often too, that situation is one in\nwhich there is an imbalance of power among the languages as the speakers of\none language dominate the speakers of the other languages economically and\nsocially. A highly codified language often accompanies that dominant position.\nA pidgin is therefore sometimes regarded as a \u2018reduced\u2019 variety of a \u2018normal\u2019\nlanguage, i.e., one of the aforementioned dominant languages, withsimplification\nof the grammar and vocabulary of that language, considerable phonological\nvariation, and an admixture of local vocabulary to meet the special needs of the\ncontact group. Holm (1988, pp. 4\u20135) defines a pidgin as:\nAITC03 61 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 62 Pidgins and Creoles\na reduced language that results from extended contact between groups of people\nwith no language in common; it evolves when they need some means of verbal\ncommunication, perhaps for trade, but no group learns the native language of\nany other group for social reasons that may include lack of trust or of close\ncontact.\nThe process of pidginization probably requires a situation that involves atleast\nthree languages (Whinnom, 1971), one of which is clearly dominant over the\nothers. If only two languages are involved, there is likely to be a direct struggle\nfor dominance, as between English and French in England after 1066, a struggle\nwon in that case by the socially inferior language but only after more than two\ncenturies of co-existence. When three or more languages are involved and one\nis dominant, the speakers of the two or more that are inferior appear to play\na critical role in the development of a pidgin. They must not only speak to those\nwho are in the dominant position, but they must also speak to each other. To\ndo this, they must simplify the dominant language in certain ways, and thisprocess\nof simplification may or may not have certain universal characteristics. We may\nargue, therefore, that a pidgin arises from the simplification of a language when\nthat language comes to dominate groups of speakers separated from each other\nby language differences. This hypothesis partially explains not only the origin of\npidgins in slave societies, in which the slaves were deliberately drawn from a\nvariety of language backgrounds, but also their origin on sea coasts, where a\nvariety of languages might be spoken but the language of trade is a pidgin. It\nalso helps to explain why pidginized varieties of languages are used much more\nas lingua francas by people who cannot speak the corresponding standard lan-\nguages than they are used between such people and speakers of the standard\nvarieties. For example, Pidgin Chinese English was used mainly by speakers of\ndifferent Chinese languages, and Tok Pisin is today used as a unifying language\namong speakers of many different languages in Papua New Guinea.\nA common view of a pidginized variety of a language, for example, Nigerian\nPidgin English, is that it is some kind of \u2018bad\u2019 English, that is, English imper-\nfectly learned and therefore of no possible interest. Consequently, those whospeak\na pidgin are likely to be regarded as deficient in some way, almost certainly\nsocially and culturally, and sometimes even cognitively. Such a view is quite un-\ntenable. Pidgins are not a kind of \u2018baby-talk\u2019 used among adults because the\nsimplified forms are the best that such people can manage. Pidgins have their\nown special rules, and, as we will see, very different pidgins have a number of\nsimilarities that raise important theoretical issues having to do with their origin.\nIndividual pidgins may be ephemeral, e.g., the pidgin German of the Gastarbeiters\n(\u2018guest-workers\u2019) in Germany that developed in the 1970s and 1980s in cities\nsuch as Berlin and Frankfurt among workers from countries such as Turkey,\nGreece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. The phenomenon, however, is persistent and\nbetween 2 and 12 million people in the world are estimated to use one or other\nof them. Furthermore, they are used for matters which are very important to\nthose concerned, even self-government in Papua New Guinea. They are highly\nfunctional in the lives of those who use them and are important for that reason\nalone if for no other.\nAITC03 62 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 63\nIn contrast to a pidgin, a creole is often defined as a pidgin that has become\nthe first language of a new generation of speakers. As Aitchison (1994, p. 3177)\nsays, \u2018creoles arise when pidgins become mother tongues.\u2019 A creole, therefore,\nis a \u2018normal\u2019 language in almost every sense. Holmes (1992, p. 95) says that \u2018A\ncreole is a pidgin which has expanded in structure and vocabulary to express the\nrange of meanings and serve the range of functions required of a first language.\u2019\nIn practice it is not always easy to say whether we have a pidgin rather than a\ncreole. Tok Pisin and some of the West African pidgins such as Nigerian Pidgin\nEnglish probably exist as both pidgins and creoles. They have speakers who use\nthem only as second languages in an expanded form and also speakers for\nwhom they are first languages. Such expanded varieties are often characteristic\nof urban environments in which there is likely to be considerable contact among\nspeakers of different languages and are sometimes referred to as extended pidgins.\nWinford (2003, p. 307) says that \u2018creoles constitute a motley assortment of\ncontact vernaculars with different histories and lines of development, though of\ncourse they still have much in common...[and] there are no structural charac-\nteristics that all creoles share...[and] no structural criteria that can distinguish\ncreoles from other types of language.\u2019\nJust like a pidgin, a creole has no simple relationship to the usuallystandardized\nlanguage with which it is associated. If a variety of pidgin English has a complex\nrelationship to Standard English, so Haitian Creole, which is French-based, has\na complex relationship to Standard French. As we will see, the latterrelationship\nis quite different in still another way from the relationship between Jamaican\nCreole, which is English-based, and Standard English. However, speakers of\ncreoles, like speakers of pidgins, may well feel that they speak something less\nthan normal languages because of the way they and others view those languages\nwhen they compare them with languages such as French and English. The result\nis that the many millions of people who speak almost nothing but creolelanguages\n\u2013 the estimates range from a low of 6\u20137 million to as many as 10\u201317 million\n\u2013 are likely to feel a great sense of inferiority about their languages. In fact, as\nmentioned above, it was only very recently that linguists themselves \u2013 those who\ntry to be most objective and least oriented toward making value judgments on\nlinguistic matters \u2013 have found creoles worthy of serious scholarly attention.\nIf we look at the actual processes involved in pidginization and creolization,\nwe can see that they are almost diametrically opposed to each other in certain\nimportant ways. Pidginization generally involves some kind of \u2018simplification\u2019 of\na language, e.g., reduction in morphology (word structure) and syntax (gram-\nmatical structure), tolerance of considerable phonological variation (pronunci-\nation), reduction in the number of functions for which the pidgin is used (e.g.,\nyou usually do not attempt to write novels in a pidgin), and extensive borrowing\nof words from local mother tongues. Winford (2003, p. 302) points out that\n\u2018pidginization is really a complex combination of different processes of change,\nincluding reduction and simplification of input materials, internal innovation,\nand regularization of structure, with L1 influence also playing a role.\u2019 On the\nother hand, creolization involves expansion of the morphology and syntax,\nregularization of the phonology, deliberate increase in the number of functions\nin which the language is used, and development of a rational and stable system\nAITC03 63 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 64 Pidgins and Creoles\nfor increasing vocabulary. But even though the processes are different, it is still\nnot always clear whether we are talking about a pidgin, an expanded pidgin, or\na creole in a certain situation. For example, the terms Hawaiian Pidgin English\nand Hawaiian Creole English may be used by even the same creolist (Bickerton,\n1977, 1983) to describe the same variety. Likewise, Tok Pisin is sometimes\ncalled a pidgin and sometimes a creole. In the absence of evidence for the\nexistence of initial pidgins, Caribbean creoles such as Haitian Creole may also\nhave come into existence through abrupt creolization, new languages created in\nas little as two generations. Mauritian creole may be another example. Creolists\ndo unite about one important matter. They \u2018generally accept that creole forma-\ntion was primarily a process of second language acquisition in rather unusual\ncircumstances. Moreover, children may have played a role in regularizing the\ndeveloping grammar\u2019 (Winford, 2003, p. 356).\nWithin pidgin and creole studies there is actually some controversy concern-\ning the terms pidginization and creolization. Winford (1997a) has pointed out\nthat these terms cover a wide variety of phenomena that are not well under-\nstood. He suggests pidgin formation and creole formation as alternatives so that\ninvestigators would focus on the specific linguistic inputs and processes that are\ninvolved: \u2018we should be asking ourselves...which kinds of linguistic processes\nand change are common to all...contact situations and which are not, andhow\nwe can formulate frameworks to account for both the similarities and differ-\nences in the types of restructuring found in each case\u2019 (p. 138). Thomason(2001)\nacknowledges that pidgins and creoles arise from contact between and among\nlanguages but stresses how varied these types of contact are so that they maywell\nresist efforts to analyze, explain, or classify the language varieties that emerge.\nRecognizing how difficult it is to achieve agreement on what exactlyconstitutes\npidgins and creoles, DeCamp (1977, pp. 4\u20135) has offered descriptions of what\nhe regards as \u2018clear-cut\u2019 examples of one of each of these. He says that:\nEveryone would agree that the Juba Arabic spoken in the southern Sudan is a\npidgin. In most communities it is not the native language of any of its speakers but\nfunctions as an auxiliary interlingua for communication between speakers of the\nmany mutually unintelligible languages spoken in that region. It is a new language,\nonly about a hundred years old. It has a small vocabulary, limited to the needs\nof trade and other interlingual communication, but this restricted vocabulary is\nsupplemented, whenever the need arises, by using words from the various native\nlanguages or from normal Arabic. It has a very simple phonology with few\nmorphophonemic processes. The complicated morphological system of Arabic\n(which includes, for example, suffixes on the verb to indicate tense, negation, and\nthe person, number, and gender of both the subject and the direct and indirect\nobjects) has been almost entirely eliminated. Such grammatical information is indic-\nated by word order, by separate uninflected pronouns or auxiliaries, or else is\nsimply missing. Yet Juba Arabic is a relatively stable language in its own right, with\nits own structure, not just half-learned or baby-talk Arabic. It is easier for an\nArabic speaker to learn than for an English speaker, but the Arabic speaker still\nmust learn it as a foreign language; he cannot simply improvise it.\nSimilarly, everyone agrees that the vernacular language of Haiti is a creole. It is\nthe native language of nearly all Haitians, though standard French is also spoken\nby some people and is the official language, and one also hears many varieties\nAITC03 64 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 65\nintermediate between the standard and the creole. Historically it probably evolved\nfrom pidginized varieties of French at the time when these began to be acquired\nas a native language. Because it is a native language and must perform a wide\nrange of communicative and expressive functions, it has an extensive vocabulary\nand complex grammatical system comparable to that of a so-called normal lan-\nguage. In fact, scholars disagree on whether there are any formal characteristics\nby which we could identify Haitian as a creole if we did not know its history.\nAlthough its vocabulary is largely French, the phonology and syntax are sodifferent\nthat most varieties are mutually unintelligible with standard French. In some ways\nits grammatical structure is more similar to creole Portuguese, creole Spanish, and\neven to creole English than to standard French, and most creolists object to calling\nit a dialect of French.\nThese two descriptions succinctly describe most of the defining features of pidgins\nand creoles. I will turn to some of these features in more detail in the following\nsection and discuss some of the implications of others in succeeding sections.\nDiscussion\n1. If someone told you that pidginized varieties of a language are \u2018corrupt\u2019\nand \u2018ungrammatical,\u2019 and indicated that their speakers are either \u2018lazy\u2019 or\n\u2018inferior,\u2019 how might you try to show that person how wrong he or she is?\nWhat kinds of evidence would you use?\n2. The \u2018stripped-down\u2019 nature of pidgins has led them to being called \u2018reduced\u2019\nor \u2018minimal\u2019 languages. They have even been compared to forms of \u2018baby-\ntalk.\u2019 A different view is that they are \u2018optimal\u2019 communication systems,\nperfectly appropriate to the circumstances of their use. Do you see any merit\nin this latter view?\n3. While there is little dispute about the origin of the term \u2018creole\u2019 when used\nto describe a type of language, there is some dispute about the origin of the\nterm \u2018pidgin.\u2019 What can you find out about the origins of the two terms,\nparticularly about the origin of the latter? (See especially Todd, 1990,\npp. 22\u20134, Romaine, 1988, pp. 12\u201313, and Aitchison, 1994, p. 3177.)\nDistribution and Characteristics\nPidgin and creole languages are distributed mainly, though not exclusively, inthe\nequatorial belt around the world, usually in places with direct or easy access to\nthe oceans. Consequently, they are found mainly in the Caribbean and aroundthe\nnorth and east coasts of South America, around the coasts of Africa, particularly\nthe west coast, and across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They are fairly uncom-\nmon in the more extreme northern and southern areas of the world and in the\ninteriors of continents. Their distribution appears to be fairly closely related to\nlong-standing patterns of trade, including trade in slaves. A basic source on their\ndistribution is Hancock (1977), a survey that was intended to list each language\nAITC03 65 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 66 Pidgins and Creoles\nthat had been treated as either a pidgin or a creole whether or not Hancock\nhimself agreed with the classification. The list includes Maltese and Hindi for\nexample, languages which Hancock believes should not be included. More\nrecently Holm (1989) provides a useful survey of pidgins and creoles, and Smith\n(1995) lists 351 pidgins and creoles along with 158 assorted mixed languages.\nHancock lists 127 pidgins and creoles. Thirty-five of these are English-based.\nThese include such languages as Hawaiian Creole, Gullah or Sea Islands Creole\n(spoken on the islands off the coasts of northern Florida, Georgia, and South\nCarolina), Jamaican Creole, Guyana Creole, Krio (spoken in Sierra Leone),\nSranan and Djuka (spoken in Suriname), Cameroon Pidgin English, Tok Pisin,\nand Chinese Pidgin English (now virtually extinct). Another fifteen are French-\nbased, e.g., Louisiana Creole, Haitian Creole, Seychelles Creole, and Mauritian\nCreole. Unlike English-based creoles, French-based creoles (both Caribbean and\nPacific varieties) are mutually intelligible. Fourteen others are Portuguese-based,\ne.g., Papiamentu (used in Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao), Guin\u00e9 Creole, Senegal\nCreole, and Saramaccan (spoken in Suriname); seven are Spanish-based, e.g.,\nCocoliche (spoken by Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires); five are Dutch-based,\ne.g., US Virgin Islands Dutch Creole (or Negerhollands), now virtually extinct,and\nAfrikaans (here said to have been creolized in the seventeenth century); three\nare Italian-based, e.g., Asmara Pidgin (spoken in parts of Ethiopia); six are\nGerman-based, e.g., Yiddish and whatever still remains of Gastarbeiter Deutsch;\nand the rest are based on a variety of other languages, e.g., Russenorsk (a\nRussian\u2013Norwegian contact language, now extinct), Chinook Jargon (a virtually\nextinct contact language of the Pacific Northwest of the United States and\nCanada), Sango (extensively used in the Central African Republic), various\npidginized forms of Swahili (a Bantu language) used widely in East Africa, and\nvarieties of Hindi, Bazaar Malay (a variety of Malay in widespread use through-\nout Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia), and Arabic. Of the one hundred-plus\nattested living pidgins and creoles, the majority are based on one or other of the\nEuropean languages, but several, e.g., Chinook Jargon and Sango, show little or\nno contact with a European language. We will see that this lack of contact isan\nimportant factor when considering the possible origins of pidgins and creoles or\nattempting to form hypotheses to account for their various sharedcharacteristics.\nThe Caribbean area is of particular interest to creolists because of the many\nvarieties of language found there. There are countries or areas that are almost\nexclusively Spanish-speaking and have no surviving pidgins or creoles as a result\nof their settlement histories, e.g., the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Puerto\nRico. Others have only English-based creoles, e.g., Antigua, Barbados, Grenada,\nJamaica, and Guyana. Still others have only French-based ones, e.g., Martinique,\nGuadeloupe, St Lucia, and Haiti. Some have both, e.g., Dominica and Trinidad.\nAruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao have Portuguese-based creoles, and one, the US\nVirgin Islands, has a virtually extinct Dutch-based creole. The official language\nin each case can be quite different: it is English in all of the above except\nMartinique, Guadeloupe, and Haiti, where it is French, and Aruba, Bonaire, and\nCura\u00e7ao, where it is Dutch. In the southern United States, there are different\nversions of French in Louisiana (Louisiana Creole, the Cajun French of Acadians\nfrom Nova Scotia, and even a very little Standard French), Gullah, and possibly\nAITC03 66 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 67\nthe variety of English now usually referred to as African American Vernacular\nEnglish (see pp. 342\u20135).\nSuriname, the former Dutch Guiana, a country on the northeast coast of\nSouth America, is particularly interesting linguistically. The official language of\nSuriname is Dutch, but that language is the native tongue of less than 2 percent\nof the population. However, two English-based creoles, Sranan and Djuka, are\nspoken. Sranan, spoken in the coastal areas, is said to be a \u2018conservative\u2019\nEnglish creole that bears little resemblance any more to English. Inland, Djuka,\nthe most important of a group of creoles known collectively as \u2018Bush Negro,\u2019\nis descended from a pidginized variety of English used by runaway slaves. It is\na creole, but it is also found in pidginized varieties among the native Indians of\nthe interior of Suriname for whom it has become a lingua franca. Also found\nin inland Suriname is another creole, Saramaccan, which is sometimes regarded\nas Portuguese-based and sometimes as English-based. It seems to have been\nundergoing a process which we will refer to as relexification (see pp. 76\u20137),\nwhen those who spoke it were cut off from contact with England after England\nceded the colony to Holland in 1667.\nThe language distribution of this whole Caribbean area reflects its social and\npolitical history. That is the only way you can explain why a French-basedcreole\nis spoken in St Lucia, which now has English as its official language; why the\nformer island of Hispaniola contains both the Spanish-speaking DominicanRepublic\nand the French-creole-speaking Haiti; why the people of Dutch Cura\u00e7ao speak\nPapiamentu, which is a Portuguese-based creole (or perhaps Portuguese with a\nlittle Spanish, there being some controversy on this matter); and why Suriname,\nofficially Dutch-speaking, has two (or perhaps three) English-based creoles.\nOther parts of the world are no less complicated linguistically. Sierra Leone\nhas both pidginized and creolized Englishes. The pidgin is West African Pidgin\nEnglish, widely used as a trading language in West Africa and to that extent\nindigenous to the country. The creole, Krio, is found in and around the capital,\nFreetown, and appears to have originated among the slaves who returned to\nAfrica from Jamaica and Britain. It is not a creolized version of West African\nPidgin English. In addition, Standard English is spoken in Freetown but with\ntwo norms, one deriving from the British Isles and the other locally based.\nConsequently, it is possible in Freetown to hear even the simplest of proposi-\ntions expressed in a variety of ways according to who is speaking and the\noccasion: Standard (British) English, Standard Sierra Leone English, Krio, and\nWest African Pidgin English.\nIn describing the linguistic characteristics of a pidgin or creole it is difficult\nto resist the temptation to compare it with the standard language with which\nit is associated. In certain circumstances such a comparison may make good\nsense, as in the linguistic situations in Jamaica and Guyana; in others, however,\nit seems to make little sense, as in Haiti. In the brief discussion that follows\nsome such comparisons will be made, but they are not meant to be invidious to\nthe pidgin or creole. Each pidgin or creole is a well-organized linguistic system\nand must be treated as such: you cannot speak Tok Pisin by just \u2018simplifying\u2019\nEnglish quite arbitrarily: you will be virtually incomprehensible to those who\nactually do speak it, nor will you comprehend them. You will instead be using\nAITC03 67 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 68 Pidgins and Creoles\nTok Masta, a term used by Papua New Guineans to describe the attempt which\ncertain anglophones make to speak Tok Pisin. To use Tok Pisin properly you\nhave to learn it, just as you must learn German or Chinese in order to speak\nthese languages properly; you might find Tok Pisin easier to learn than those\ntwo languages, but that is another matter, something of the same order as being\nlikely to find German easier to learn than Chinese.\nThe sounds of a pidgin or creole are likely to be fewer and less complicated\nin their possible arrangements than those of the corresponding standardlanguage.\nFor example, Tok Pisin makes use of only five basic vowels and also has fewer\nconsonants than English. No contrast is possible between words like it and eat,\nor pin and fin, or sip, ship, and chip: the necessary vowel and consonant dis-\ntinctions (contrasts) are not present. Speakers of Tok Pisin distinguish a ship\nfrom a sheep by calling the first a sip and the second a sipsip. It is also because\nof the lack of the \/p\/\u2013\/f\/ distinction that some written versions of Tok Pisin\nrecord certain words with p spellings, whereas others record the same words\nwith f spellings. So far as speakers of Tok Pisin are concerned, it does not make\nany difference if you say wanpela or wanfela (\u2018one\u2019); you will be judged to have\nsaid the words in the same way, any difference being no more important to\nspeakers of Tok Pisin than the difference to us between typical North Amer-\nican and British English pronunciations of the middle consonant sound in butter.\nWhile the numbers of sounds used in pidgins and creoles may be smaller than\nin the corresponding standard languages, they also tend to \u2018vary\u2019 more as to\ntheir precise quality.\nOne additional point is worth stressing. A language like English often has\ncomplicated phonological relationships between words (or morphemes, the small\nbits of meaning in words) that are closely related, e.g., the first vowel in type\nand typical, the c in space and spacious, and the different sounds of the \u2018plural\u2019\nending in cats, dogs, and boxes. The technical term for this is morphophonemic\nvariation. Such variation is not found in pidgins, but the development of such\nvariation may be one characteristic of creolization, the process by which a\npidgin becomes a creole.\nIn pidgins and creoles there is likely to be a complete lack of inflection in\nnouns, pronouns, verbs, and adjectives. Nouns are not marked for number and\ngender, and verbs lack tense markers. Transitive verbs, that is, verbs that take\nobjects, may, however, be distinguished from intransitive verbs, that is, those\nthat do not take objects, by being marked, e.g., by a final -im in Tok Pisin.\nPronouns will not be distinguished for case, so there will be no I\u2013me, he\u2013him\nalternations. In Tok Pisin me is either \u2018I\u2019 or \u2018me.\u2019 The equivalent of \u2018we\u2019 is either\nmipela (\u2018I and other(s) but not you\u2019) or yumi (\u2018I and you\u2019). Yu is different from\nyupela (\u2018singular\u2019 versus \u2018plural\u2019), and em (\u2018he,\u2019 \u2018she,\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019) is distinguished\nfrom ol (\u2018they\u2019 or \u2018them\u2019). In Tok Pisin there are few required special endings\non words, and two of these are actually homophones: -pela, a suffix on adject-\nives, as in wanpela man (\u2018one man\u2019), and -pela, a plural suffix on pronouns, as\nin yupela (\u2018you plural\u2019). Another is -im, the transitive suffix marker on verbs\nthat is mentioned above.\nWe should not be surprised that there is such a complete reduction ofinflection\nin pidgins. Differences like one book\u2013two books, he bakes\u2013he baked, and big\u2013\nAITC03 68 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 69\nbigger are quite expendable. No one seems to have any interest in maintaining\nthem, and alternative ways are found to express the same concepts of number,\ntime, and comparison. In contrast, we should note how important inflectional\nendings and changes are in a language like English, particularly irregular ones\nsuch as go\u2013went, good\u2013better, and drink, drank, drunk. They are used as one\nof the indicators of regional and social origin. Which set of inflections you\nacquire is almost entirely an accident of birth, but if it is not the socially\npreferred set the accident can prove to be a costly one. Pidgins do comfortably\nwithout inflections, but it is not surprising that some people view their absence\nas a sign of deficiency and inferiority in both languages and speakers in much\nthe same way as they view acquisition of a set which is dispreferred.\nSyntactically, sentences are likely to be uncomplicated in clausal structure.The\ndevelopment of embedded clauses, e.g., of relative clauses, is one characteristic\nof the process of creolization: pidgins do not have such embedding. The use of\nparticles, that is, usually small isolated words, is also quite frequent. Negationmay\nbe achieved through use of a simple negative particle no in the English-based\nKrio, e.g., i no tu had (\u2018It\u2019s not too hard\u2019) and pa in the French-based Seychelles\nCreole, e.g., i pa tro difisil (\u2018It\u2019s not too difficult\u2019). One particularly interesting\nfeature is the use of pre-verbal particles to show that an action is continuing,\ni.e., to show \u2018continuous aspect.\u2019 We can see this in the use of de, ape, and\nka in the following examples taken respectively from English, French, and\nPortuguese creoles: a de go wok (\u2018I\u2019m going to work\u2019 in Krio); mo ape travaj\n(\u2018I\u2019m working\u2019 in Louisiana French); and e ka nda (\u2018He\u2019s going\u2019 in St Thomas).\nWhat we can see from even these few examples is that creoles associated with\nquite different standard languages apparently use identical syntactic devices.\nThis phenomenon has intrigued many creolists and, as we will see in the follow-\ning section, has led to the formulation of certain hypotheses about the origins\nof pidgins and creoles.\nThe vocabulary of a pidgin or a creole has a great many similarities to that\nof the standard language with which it is associated. However, it will be much\nmore limited, and phonological and morphological simplification often leads to\nwords assuming somewhat different shapes. As noted above in the example of\nsip and sipsip, it is sometimes necessary to use this reduplicative pattern to avoid\npossible confusion or to express certain concepts, e.g., \u2018repetition\u2019 or \u2018intensifica-\ntion.\u2019 Consequently, we find pairs like talk (\u2018talk\u2019) and talktalk (\u2018chatter\u2019), dry\n(\u2018dry\u2019) and drydry (\u2018unpalatable\u2019), look (\u2018look\u2019) and looklook (\u2018stare\u2019), cry (\u2018cry\u2019)\nand crycry (\u2018cry continually\u2019), pis (\u2018peace\u2019) and pispis (\u2018urinate\u2019), and san (\u2018sun\u2019)\nand sansan (\u2018sand\u2019). Certain concepts require a somewhat elaborate encoding:\nfor example, in Tok Pisin \u2018hair\u2019 is gras bilong het, \u2018beard\u2019 is gras bilong fes,\n\u2018feathers\u2019 is gras bilong pisin, \u2018moustache\u2019 is gras bilong maus, \u2018my car\u2019 is ka\nbilong me, and \u2018bird\u2019s wing\u2019 is han bilong pisin. A pidgin or creole may draw\non the vocabulary resources of more than one language. Tok Pisin draws prim-\narily from English but also from Polynesian sources, e.g., kaikai (\u2018food\u2019), and\neven German, because of historical reasons, e.g., rausim (\u2018throw out\u2019 from the\nGerman heraus, \u2018outside\u2019). The source may not always be a \u2018polite\u2019 one, e.g.,\nTok Pisin bagarap (\u2018break down\u2019) is from the English bugger up. So ka bilong\nmi i bagarap is \u2018My car broke down.\u2019 In examples like pikinini man (\u2018boy\u2019 or\nAITC03 69 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 70 Pidgins and Creoles\n\u2018son\u2019), pikinini meri (\u2018girl\u2019 or \u2018daughter\u2019), pikinini dok (\u2018puppy\u2019), and pikinini\npik (\u2018piglet\u2019), we can see not only the process of showing \u2018diminutives\u2019 through\nthis use of pikinini but also a connection to the Portuguese word peque\u00f1o(\u2018little\u2019).\nIn the Caribbean varieties, there is also often a noticeable African element in the\nvocabulary (e.g., see Turner, 1949, on Gullah). Still another source of vacabulary\nwill be innovation. A good example from Winford (2003, p. 322) is \u2018as (< Engl.\narse) means not just \u201cbuttock,\u201d but also \u201ccause, foundation.\u201d Similarly, bel\nmeans not just \u201cbelly,\u201d but also \u201cseat of the emotions\u201d.\u2019\nDiscussion\n1. Pidgins and creoles have been said to have \u2018the grammar of one language\nand the vocabulary of another.\u2019 In what sense is such a statement true, false,\nor a bit of both?\n2.

The following extract is from A Man of the People (1975a, pp. 14\u2013\n15). What characteristics of pidgins and creoles do you find in it?\nThe same man who had drawn our attention to the Minister\u2019s humility was\nnow pointing out yet another quality.

Would the use of a spelling system based on Standard French (ratherthan\nthis kind of spelling) make these sentences easier to comprehend, or would\nit suggest similarities that are not really there? What might such a spelling\nlook like in this case?

Pidgins from very different parts of\nthe world exhibit remarkable similarities in structure even when the standard\nlanguages with which they are associated are quite different. Furthermore, pidgins\nAITC03 73 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 74 Pidgins and Creoles\nand creoles based on the same standard language but found in places far distant\nfrom one another may have a high degree of mutual intelligibility, e.g., the\nvarious pidginized and creolized varieties of French found geographically as far\napart as the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, and the South Pacific. How can we\naccount for these similarities?\nOne theory about the origins of pidgins is easily dismissed. This is the ideathat\npidgins arise because the people among whom they are found lack the ability\nto learn the standard languages with which the pidgins are associated. Such a\nview may sometimes be associated with another one, that European languagesare\nsomehow \u2018better\u2019 than others and that many people speak \u2018primitive\u2019 languages,\ni.e., languages that are \u2018deficient\u2019 in certain respects. Such deficiencies may then\nbe cited as evidence that the people themselves are inferior. We must note that\nlinguists have been unable to locate a single such \u2018primitive language,\u2019 thatclaims\nabout associated intellectual deficiencies are largely \u2018racist,\u2019 and that this theory\nabout the origins of pidgins ignores many important facts.\nThere is no evidence either for any \u2018foreigner-talk\u2019 or \u2018baby-talk\u2019 theory (see\nBloomfield, 1933, pp. 472\u20133) for the origin of pidgins and creoles, i.e., that they\nresult from Europeans deliberately simplifying their languages in order to\ncommunicate with others. According to this theory, these simplified forms then\nserve to provide pidgins with their basic structures and vocabularies. There are\ntoo many structural similarities among pidgins and creoles associated with very\ndifferent European languages to make such a theory of origin plausible, e.g.,\nbetween the English-based creole of Jamaica and the French-based one of Haiti.\nIf there is evidence of simplification, it is evidence of some very different process\nat work than any kind of \u2018talking down,\u2019 \u2018baby-talk,\u2019 or \u2018mimicry\u2019 can explain.\nMoreover, pidgins are far less frequently used between Europeans and non-\nEuropeans than among non-Europeans. In fact, many Europeans who must deal\nregularly with pidginized varieties of their languages speak them very badly\nindeed, failing to understand some of the basic structural characteristics of the\npidgins. Finally, there is plenty of evidence that it is Europeans who learn the\npidgins from non-Europeans rather than the opposite, although the use of so\nmuch European vocabulary may tend to conceal that fact.\nOne theory, the theory of polygenesis, is that pidgins and creoles have a\nvariety of origins; any similarities among them arise from the shared circum-\nstances of their origins. For example, speakers of English have had to make\nthemselves understood for the purposes of trade and those trading with them\nhave had to be understood. Consequently, certain simplified forms of English\nhave developed independently in a number of places, giving rise to varieties of\npidgin English. Because in every case the target language is English, these local\nvarieties will have certain similarities. In this view a \u2018pidgin X\u2019 or \u2018creolized Y\u2019\nis a variety of X or Y, much as Cockney English is a variety of English. Then,\nmore generally, since English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese are really not so\ndifferent \u2013 they are all Indo-European languages \u2013 we might expect similarities.\nWe can go even further to claim that a \u2018simplification\u2019 process for any language\nwould produce much the same results everywhere: a simpler set of sounds, no\ninflections, basic word order patterns, short uncomplicated utterances, and so\non. Various other explanations have been offered for the resulting similarities\nAITC03 74 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 75\nincluding the similar social contexts of their origin, the similar communicative\nneeds of those who use them, and, most plausible of all, a shared substratum.\nThis last idea seems particularly appropriate to explain many similarities\namong the Atlantic Ocean and possibly certain Indian Ocean pidgins and creoles\non the one hand and Pacific Ocean pidgins and creoles on the other. The former\nare said to have an African substrate and the latter an Oceanic one, i.e., each\ncontains certain language characteristics of the native ancestral languages of\ntheir speakers. In this view Atlantic pidgins and creoles retain certain charac-\nteristics of ancestral African languages. African slaves were often multilingual,\nspoke languages of similar structure but different vocabulary, and tended to\ntreat English and French, and to a lesser extent Portuguese, in the same way.\nTherefore, the pidgins and creoles are European-language-based and were freshly\ncreated in different places. What similarities they have they owe to this fusion\nof European and African components (see Holm, 1988, 2004, and Winford,\n2003, pp. 16\u201317).\nWe can contrast such polygenetic views with monogenetic ones. One suchview\nof the similarities among Atlantic pidgins and creoles requires us to examine the\nvery beginnings of the pidginization process. For example, according to McWhorter\n(1995, 2000), their similarities can be accounted for if we look back to the\nbeginnings of the slave trade and the existence of English and French slave\nforts on the West African Coast. In these forts contact languages developed,\nwith the most important of these from this point of view being West African\nPidgin Portuguese. These contact languages provided the bases for most of the\npidgins and creoles that later developed across the Atlantic. This is his Afrogenesis\nhypothesis concerning origin. McWhorter points to the relative paucity ofSpanish-\nbased creoles in the New World as evidence which supports this claim as well\nas to the fact that such creoles are also missing from places we might expect to\nfind them, e.g., Puerto Rico and Cuba. (The Spanish creoles that do exist, e.g.,\nPapiamentu, are relexified (see following pages) Portuguese ones.) McWhorter\npoints out that Spain came late to the sugar industry, did not use labor-intensive\ncultivation systems, sometimes took areas from Portugal, and did not have large\nslave forts and settlements in Africa. This view of the development of pidginsand\ncreoles is a monogenetic view, claiming as it does that a single source accounts\nfor the perceived similarities among the varieties we find.\nAnother variant of such a monogenetic theory is that the similarities among\npidgins and creoles might be attributable to a common origin in the language\nof sailors in some kind of nautical jargon. It is a well-known fact that the crews\nof ships were \u2013 and sometimes still are \u2013 often drawn from a variety of sources.\nFor example, Nelson\u2019s flagship Victory is said to have been crewed by sailors of\nfourteen different nationalities. A common shipboard lingua franca, or nautical\njargon, developed among the members of the sailing community. In this view,\nit was that lingua franca, rather than a pidginized variety of a standard lan-\nguage, that was carried along the shipping routes. However, the evidence for this\ntheory is weak, consisting of a few sea-based terms in different pidgins. More-\nover, it almost completely ignores the more serious structural similarities among\nexisting pidgins and creoles, similarities that seem to require a more profound\nexplanation.\nAITC03 75 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 76 Pidgins and Creoles\nThe theory of relexification is an attempt to offer such an explanation.Accord-\ning to this theory, all the present European-language-based pidgins and creoles\nderive from a single source, a lingua franca called Sabir used in the Mediter-\nranean in the Middle Ages. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries thePortuguese\nrelexified this language; that is, they introduced their own vocabulary into its\ngrammatical structure, so that a Portuguese-based pidgin came into widespread\nuse as a trade language. Later, this pidgin was in turn relexified into pidginized\nFrench, English, and Spanish. In each case the underlying grammatical struc-\nture remained largely unaffected, but a massive shift occurred in vocabulary as\nreplacement words were imported from the lexifier language to produce a con-\nspicuous superstratum. It is also argued that Portuguese relics still remain after\nrelexification, e.g., savvy and piccaninny (from Portuguese saber, \u2018know,\u2019 and\npeque\u00f1o, \u2018little\u2019), in English-based creoles.\nSuch a theory attempts to provide a serious explanation for the fact that\npidgins and creoles associated with different standard languages have certain\ncommon structural features but quite different vocabularies. In this view a\npidgin English is therefore an Anglicized version of the original pidgin and a\npidgin French is a Gallicized version. The theory leads creolists such as Todd\n(1990) to go so far as to use a version of the classical comparative method of recon-\nstruction in an attempt to show how various pidgins and creoles have descended\nfrom a Portuguese-based ancestor. Todd provides a family-tree type model\n(p. 37) for pidgins and creoles, which shows them originating in Sabir. Sabir\nthen becomes Proto-Portuguese Pidgin, which in turn splits into two distinct\nbranches, Atlantic Portuguese Pidgin and Indo-Pacific Portuguese Pidgin. The\nformer has sub-branches with Portuguese varieties (e.g., Guin\u00e9 Crioule),Hispanic\nvarieties (e.g., Papiamentu), Anglicized varieties (e.g., Jamaican), and Gallicized\nones (e.g., Louisiana, Haitian); the latter has its sub-branches too \u2013 Gallicized\nones (e.g., Seychelles), Nederlandized ones (e.g., Afrikaans), and Anglicized ones\n(e.g., Tok Pisin).\nThe theory of relexification is not without its problems. One is that pidgins\nare so stripped down that they lack most of the features that linguists usually\nrely on to relate one language to another. The similarities among them are very\ngeneral, and it is quite possible that some alternative theory may better explain\nthem, e.g., some general principles of language acquisition. Relexification also\nasks us to believe that, in learning a language, people somehow can learn the\ngrammar quite independently of the vocabulary and that they do indeed learn\nthe first but completely replace the second during the process of learning. We\nmight also expect more Portuguese to have survived.\nLefebvre (1998), after more than twenty years of study of Haitian Creole,\nanswers some of these objections. He says (pp. 10\u201311) that there are important\nfactors in the creation of a creole. Adults relexify to communicate: \u2018creole lan-\nguages [are] created by adult speakers with a mature lexicon.\u2019 A process of\ndialect leveling follows, which \u2018operates on the variation resulting from the\nrelexification of the various substratum lexicons,\u2019 there usually being several of\nthese. Finally, speakers reanalyze the resulting language in \u2018a mental process\nwhereby a particular form which signals one lexical entry becomes the signal of\nAITC03 76 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 77\nanother lexical entry.\u2019 In other words relexification is the starting point of a\nlarger process.\nThere is some good evidence that relexification has occurred. If we look at\nSaramaccan, it seems to be a pidgin in the process of relexification fromPortuguese\nto English (hence the disagreement I noted earlier about its classification). It was\n\u2018frozen\u2019 in this intermediate, transitional stage when its speakers were cut off\nfrom England in 1667 when the colony became a Dutch possession. There is\nalso evidence that in parts of West Africa such kinds of replacement do occur,\nthat people know the vocabularies of different languages but use a kind of\ncommon grammar in speaking them so that when they come across a new\nlanguage they employ the \u2018new\u2019 vocabulary in the \u2018old\u2019 grammatical framework\nand manage to make themselves understood. We could argue, however, that all\nwe have in this case is a reintroduction of the substratum theory in a new and\nsubtle form; in any case, such a theory seems inadequate on other grounds.\nThere is also no apparent relexification possible for varieties such as Pitcairnese\n(spoken by descendants of the Bounty mutiny of 1790), Sango, and Chinook\nJargon. At least some pidgins and creoles cannot owe their origin to thisprocess.\nOne of the severest condemnations of relexification comes from Bickerton\n(1977, p. 62), who argues that: \u2018We are asked to believe that an original contact\nlanguage could be disseminated round the entire tropical zone, to peoples of\nwidely differing language background, and still preserve a virtually complete\nidentity in its grammatical structure wherever it took root, despite considerable\nchanges in its phonology and virtually complete changes in its lexicon.\u2019 Bickerton\nconsiders that relexification asks us to accept too many improbabilities. Instead,\nhe offers (1981) an alternative theory to account for the similarities we find: his\nLanguage Bioprogram hypothesis.\nBickerton (1983) claims that only this hypothesis adequately explains the\nsimilarities among creoles: universal principles of first language acquisition are\ninvolved. Jespersen (1922, p. 234) had previously pointed out certain similarities\nbetween pidgins and creoles and children\u2019s language. Bickerton argues that it is\nbetter to focus on what pidgins and creoles have and do than on what they lack.\nTypically, creoles are developed by children who find themselves born into a\nmultilingual environment in which the most important language for peer contact\nis a pidgin. Children are compelled to develop that language because each child\nhas a bioprogram to develop a full language. Children use this bioprogram in\nthe same way wherever they happen to be and the consequence is that \u2018the\ngrammatical structures of creoles are more similar to one another than they are\nto the structures of any other language\u2019 (p. 121). Bickerton further develops this\nthesis, claiming that children have certain innate language abilities that they are\nactually forced to suppress as they learn languages like English and French. \u2018It\n[is] only in pidgin-speaking communities, where there [is] no grammatical model\nthat could compete with the child\u2019s innate grammar, that the innate grammatical\nmodel [is] not eventually suppressed\u2019 (p. 121). It is in just these circumstances\nthat creoles arise. Bickerton says that the essential difference between pidginization\nand creolization is that pidginization is second-language learning with restricted\ninput and creolization is first-language learning, also with restricted input. There\nAITC03 77 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 78 Pidgins and Creoles\nhas been much discussion of Bickerton\u2019s ideas but they have found only luke-\nwarm support; they are said to give too much weight to the role of children in\nthe development of creoles and too little to the role of expanded pidgins, the\ndiversity found in creoles, and the amount of time the creolization process\nusually requires. However, at the same time we will see in various chapters that\nfollow that there is considerable evidence showing that children play an import-\nant role in how languages change.\nDiscussion\n1. Hall (1966, p. 122) points out that \u2018English has been extensively relexified,\nin the last thousand years, with morphemes [i.e., words and parts of words\nwith meaning]...from French, Latin, and Greek; yet it is still to be clas-\nsified as a Germanic, not a Romance, language\u2019 because of its basic struc-\ntural features, which are Germanic. In what ways is this kind of relexification\nsimilar to and different from the kind discussed in this chapter?\n2. Bickerton (1977, p. 49) says that, essentially, \u2018pidginization is second-\nlanguage learning with restricted input, and...creolization is first-language\nlearning with restricted input.\u2019 How valid do you think Bickerton\u2019s claim is?\n3. Bickerton (1983, p. 116) claims that there is now an impressive body of\nevidence to support the following claim: \u2018between the ages of two and four\nthe child born into a community of linguistically competent adults speaks\na variety of language whose structure bears a deep resemblance to the\nstructure of creole languages.\u2019 Assess this claim. You should consult Bickerton\n(1990).\nFrom Pidgin to Creole\nWhatever their origins, it is generally acknowledged that a pidgin is almost\nalways involved in the earliest stage of a creole. The pidgin comes about from\nthe need to communicate, particularly when those who need to communicate\nspeak a variety of languages and the speakers of the \u2018target\u2019 language are\u2018superior\u2019\nin some sense and perhaps transient too. Thus, pidginization seems to have\nhappened \u2013 and seems still to happen \u2013 repeatedly, for it is one of the basic\nmeans by which linguistic contact is made among speakers of different lan-\nguages who find themselves in an asymmetrical social relationship, i.e., one in\nwhich there is a serious imbalance of power. The fact that is especially interest-\ning is how similar the results are from place to place and from time to time.\nNot every pidgin eventually becomes a creole, i.e., undergoes the process of\ncreolization. In fact, very few do. Most pidgins are lingua francas, existing to\nmeet temporary local needs. They are spoken by people who use another lan-\nguage or other languages to serve most of their needs and the needs of their\nchildren. If a pidgin is no longer needed, it dies out. It may also be the case that\nAITC03 78 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 79\nthe pidgin in a particular area must constantly be \u2018reinvented\u2019; there is no reason\nto believe, for example, that either Cameroonian Pidgin English or Hawaiian\nPidgin English have had uninterrupted histories.\nCreolization occurs only when a pidgin for some reason becomes the varietyof\nlanguage that children must use in situations in which use of a \u2018full\u2019 language\nis effectively denied them. A creole is the native language of some of itsspeakers.\nWe can see how this must have happened in Haiti when French was effectively\ndenied to the masses and the African languages brought by the slaves fell into\ndisuse. We can also see how, while many of the guest workers in Germany\ndeveloped pidginized varieties of German to communicate when necessary with\none another, their children did not creolize these varieties but, with varying suc-\ncess, acquired Standard German, since they had to go to school and be educated\nin German. A full language was available to them so they had no need tocreolize\nGastarbeiter Deutsch.\nThe example of Tok Pisin is useful in considering how a pidgin expands and\ndevelops into a creole. It was not until the 1960s that the pidgin was nativized,\ni.e., children began to acquire it as a first language, and, therefore, becoming for\nthem a creole (while remaining an extended pidgin for previous generations).\nM\u00fchlh\u00e4usler (1982) has noted that in Tok Pisin grammatical categories such as\ntime and number have become compulsory, a word-formation component has\nbeen developed, devices for structuring discourse are now present, and there are\nopportunities for stylistic differentiation (p. 449). So far as functions are con-\ncerned, Tok Pisin has become symbolic of a new culture; it is now used in many\nentirely new domains, e.g., government, religion, agriculture, and aviation; it is\nemployed in a variety of media; and it is supplanting the vernaculars and even\nEnglish in many areas (pp. 448\u20139). Aitchison (1991) has also noted what is\nhappening to Tok Pisin. She points out four kinds of change. One of these is that\npeople speak creoles faster than pidgins and they do not speak them word by\nword. Consequently, processes of assimilation and reduction can be seen atwork\nin Tok Pisin: ma bilong mi (\u2018my husband\u2019) becomes mamblomi. A second change\nis the expansion of vocabulary resources: new shorter words are formed, so that\npaitman (\u2018fighter\u2019) exists alongside man bilong pait (\u2018man of fight\u2019). There is also\nmuch borrowing of technical vocabulary from English. A third change is the\ndevelopment of a tense system in verbs. Bin is used as a past time marker and\nbai, from baimbai (\u2018by and by\u2019), as a future time marker. Finally, greater sen-\ntence complexity is now apparent. Some speakers are now able to construct\nrelative clauses because we (from \u2018where\u2019) is developing as an introductory\nmarker. In ways such as these, the original pidgin is quickly developing into a\nfully fledged language, which we call a creole only because we know its origin.\nThis last point is important: it is only because we know the origins of creoles\nthat we know they are creoles. Hall (1966, pp. 122\u20133) has observed that:\nAll the evidence available so far indicates that the type of linguistic change and the\nmechanisms involved \u2013 sound-change, analogy, borrowing of various kinds \u2013 are\nthe same for pidgins and creoles as they are for all other languages. The only\ndifference lies in the rate of change \u2013 far faster for a pidgin (because of the drastic\nreduction in structure and lexicon) than for most languages. When a pidgin has\nAITC03 79 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 80 Pidgins and Creoles\nbecome nativized, the history of the resultant creole is, in essence, similar to that\nof any other language. Hence, whereas a pidgin is identifiable at any given time by\nboth linguistic and social criteria, a creole is identifiable only by historical criteria\n\u2013 that is, if we know that it has arisen out of a pidgin. There are no structural\ncriteria which, in themselves, will identify a creole as such, in the absence of\nhistorical evidence.\nHall adds that the kinds of changes we associate with creolization normally take\nthousands of years in languages for which we have good historical data.\nRecent intensive study of pidgins and creoles has revealed how quickly such\nlanguages can and do change. Pidginization can occur almost \u2018overnight.\u2019 Relexi-\nfication also seems to be a rapid process. Creolization can take as little as two\ngenerations. The particular combination of language and social contact that\ngives rise to pidgins and creoles seems also to have occurred frequently in the\nhistory of the human species.\nWhat this suggests is that many now traditional views about how languages\nchange may need revision. Such change may not be slow and regular at all, or\nit may be so only in the absence of certain kinds of language contact. Since\ncontact situations appear to hasten change, the study of pidgins and creoles\noffers important clues to the kinds of changes that you might seek to discover.\nFor example, does a contact situation lead to a reduction in inflectional morph-\nology? Does it favor the development of a fixed word order in sentences? Find-\ning answers to questions such as these may provide interesting insights into how\nlanguages change.\nBecause a creole can be related to some other dominant (or superordinate)\nlanguage a creole (or post-creole) continuum can arise. For example, an English-\nbased creole can develop a number of varieties when it is in contact with\nStandard English. As the range of these varieties increases, Standard English\nmay more and more influence them so that some varieties will come to resemble\nStandard English. This process has become known as decreolization. However,\nWinford (1997b) points out that there are various kinds of continua and \u2018Each\ncreole continuum is unique in its own way\u2019 (p. 311). Consequently, muchresearch\nis still needed to discover how the varieties arise and relate to one another.\nIn discussing the creole continuum that exists in Guyanese English, Bickerton\n(1975, p. 24) has proposed a number of terms that may be used to refer to its\ndifferent parts. He uses the term acrolect to refer to educated Guyanese English,\na variety which really has very few differences from other varieties of Standard\nEnglish. He uses the term basilect to refer to the variety at the other extreme\nof the continuum, the variety that would be least comprehensible to a speaker\nof the standard, perhaps even incomprehensible. Mesolects are intermediate\nvarieties. However, these are not discrete entities, for one important character-\nistic of these intermediate mesolects is that they blend into one another to fill\nthe \u2018space\u2019 between the acrolect and the basilect.\nAs we might expect, there is considerable social stratification involved in such\na situation. Bickerton cites Allsopp (1958) to show how the following Guyanese\nvarieties of the Standard English sentence I told him may be pronounced in the\nvarious parts of the continuum:\nAITC03 80 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 81\n1. ai t\u00d1uld him\n2. ai to:ld him\n3. ai to:l im\n4. ai tyl im\n5. a tyl im\n6. ai tyl i\n7. a tyl i\n8. mi tyl i\n9. mi tyl am\nThe first three varieties (1\u20133) exemplify middle-class usage and are typical acrolect\nforms. The next four (4\u20137) are mesolect forms found in the lower-middle and\nurban working classes. Item 8 is found in the rural working class, and item 9\nis used by old and illiterate rural laborers: these are typical basilect forms.\nAdditional evidence on the Guyanese continuum is provided by Bell (1976,\np. 136), who produces the sentences found in table 3.1. He uses information\nsupplied by Cave (1973) to show how, in the Guyanese continuum, there are\neighteen different ways of rendering a sentence like I gave him one. In this con-\ntinuum the \u2018highest\u2019 acrolect sentence is [ai geiv him w\u00cen], the \u2018lowest\u2019 basilect\nsentence is [mi gi: \u00e6m wan], and there are intermediate mesolect sentences such\nas 8 [a did giv i: wan], and 13 [mi di gi hi: wan].\nWriting of the continuum that exists in Jamaica, DeCamp (1977, p. 29) has\nobserved that particular speakers control a span of the spectrum, not just one\ndiscrete level within it. He says that the breadth of the span depends on the\nbreadth of the speaker\u2019s social activities:\nA labor leader, for example, can command a greater span of varieties than can a\nsheltered housewife of suburban middle class. A housewife may make a limited\nadjustment downward on the continuum in order to communicate with a market\nwoman, and the market woman may adjust upward when she talks to the house-\nwife. Each of them may then believe that she is speaking the other\u2019s language,\nfor the myth persists in Jamaica that there are only two varieties of language \u2013\nstandard English and \u2018the dialect\u2019 \u2013 but the fact is that the housewife\u2019s broadest\ndialect may be closer to the standard end of the spectrum than is the market\nwoman\u2019s \u2018standard.\u2019\nWhat is particularly important here, though, is the additional observation that\nJamaicans do not perceive the existence of a continuum. Instead, they perceive\nwhat they say and hear only in relation to the two ends and make any judg-\nments and adjustments in terms of the two extremes, Standard English or \u2018the\ndialect,\u2019 \u2018patois,\u2019 or \u2018Quashie,\u2019 as it is sometimes referred to. Patrick (1999)\npoints out that at least in Kingston the continuum is much more complicated:\nmulti-dimensional rather than uni-dimensional. The idea of a simple continuum\nmay therefore be little more than a neat theoretical concept, since the variation\nfound in everyday language use requires taking into consideration many other\nexplanatory factors.\nA continuum can arise only if the two extreme varieties are varieties of the same\nlanguage, as with standard X and creolized X (e.g., Standard English andJamaican\nAITC03 81 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 82 Pidgins and Creoles\nTable 3.1 A Guyanese continuum\n1 a} w\u00cen\n2 him\n3 ge}v }m\n4 i:\n5 h}m\n6 a g}v }m\n7\n8 d}d g}v i:\n9 d}\n10 d}d g} wan\n11 gi:\n12\n13 d} g} hi:\n14\n15 m} i:\n16 b}n\n17 gi: \u00e6m\n18\nSource: Bell (1976, p. 136)\nCreole English). When different languages are involved there can be nocontinuum,\nas between Sranan, an English-based creole, and Dutch in Suriname. If the\ntotal society is highly stratified, so that there is little or no contact between the\ngroups who speak the creolized and superordinate varieties, and\/or if these two\nvarieties have separate and distinct functions in the lives of people, then there\nwill be no continuum. We will have a diglossic situation (see chapter 4), as in\nAITC03 82 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 83\nHaiti between Haitian Creole and French. A continuum appears to require that\nthere be some kind of continuity in society among the various sub-groups. It\narises from the development of varieties intermediate between the original pidgins\nand the superordinate variety. The different linguistic situations in Jamaica and\nHaiti would therefore suggest that the social situations in these countries are\nvery different, a suggestion which seems to have some validity.\nIt is also important to note that not only Patrick (1999) but others such as\nLe Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985) reject the idea of the continuum as being\naltogether too simplistic. They claim that it results from simplifying and manip-\nulating data rather than trying to confront the evidence in all its complexity.\nIt is too simplistic to explain the linguistic choices that speakers make. It is\nessentially a uni-dimensional approach to a situation in which all the factors\nsuggest that only a multi-dimensional approach can offer an appropriateaccount\nof speakers\u2019 linguistic behavior. There is considerable merit to this view.\nAccording to theorists such as Rickford (1977) and Dillard (1972), theprocess\nof decreolization can also be observed in the United States in what has happened\nin the linguistic history of the black slave population that was brought to work\nthe cotton plantations. The original slaves brought with them a number of West\nAfrican languages, but many must also have arrived with some knowledge of\nPortuguese-based or English-based pidgins, the trading lingua francas of the\nAfrican coast. Slave owners deliberately chose slaves from different languageback-\ngrounds to discourage rebellion. Such circumstances fostered the development\nof English-based pidgins and the process of creolization. So long as whites and\nblacks kept a considerable distance apart, physically and socially, there was little\nopportunity for decreolization. We can see that this was the case with Gullah,\ngeographically isolated on the Sea Islands off the southeast coast and still today\nthe most distinctive indigenous black speech in the United States, particularly\nbecause of its large African vocabulary (see Mufwene, 1993). However, as blacks\nbegan to win more and more recognition of equality under the law and oppor-\ntunities for various kinds of advancement increased, Standard English began to\nexert a strong influence on the original creole, so that today a genuine con-\ntinuum exists. In fact, this continuum is so strong that many people, both whites\nand blacks, regard any characteristics which seem to mark the speech of US\nblacks as being instances of either \u2018southern\u2019 speech or \u2018lower-class\u2019 speech. In\nother words, AAVE, the modern reflex of the original creole, is now regarded\nas either a regional or social variant of the standard language. There are, how-\never, other explanations of the origins of AAVE. We will return to these and\nrelated matters in chapter 14 because of some of the consequences that arise in\nresolving certain educational issues.\nA diglossic situation is one in which the creole and the standard lack con-\ntinuity so far as functions are concerned, and that functional discontinuity is\ngenerally strongly supported by severe social stratification. Haitian Creole and\nStandard French differ almost as much as two quite unrelated languages; there\nare no intermediate varieties in Haiti, and the two are kept socially andfunction-\nally apart. In Haiti one possible solution to such a diglossic situation wouldseem\nto be the elevation of the creole to \u2018full\u2019 language status through the process of\nstandardization. However, the socially and politically elite in Haiti, even though\nAITC03 83 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 84 Pidgins and Creoles\nthey themselves use Haitian Creole in certain circumstances, officially disdain\nany language other than Standard French and the general populace find little or\nno encouragement for thinking well of the creole. On the other hand, Afrikaans,\nof possible creole origin, has been developed into a \u2018full\u2019 language in South\nAfrica, Bahasa Indonesia has been developed out of certain varieties of Malay,\nand Tok Pisin is now used in Papua New Guinea as a unifying language.\nAs Bell (1976, pp. 160\u20131) has pointed out, various things can happen to a\ncreole. It can reach a quite stable relationship with the language or languages\nof the community, as in the current relationship between Haitian Creole and\nFrench. It may for one reason or another be extinguished by the standard lan-\nguage: for example, in the Dutch West Indies, Dutch has virtually extinguished\nNegerhollands, and English is severely cutting into Gullah in the Sea Islands. A\ncreole may in some cases become a standard language, with possible examples\nbeing Afrikaans, Swahili, Bahasa Indonesia, and Maltese. A creole continuum,\nas for example in Jamaica and Guyana, is another possibility.\nThe different linguistic situations create different social and educational prob-\nlems for speakers of the pidgins and creoles. In a diglossic situation such as in\nHaiti there are traditional power relationships exemplified in the distributions\nof the two varieties of language, e.g., Haitian Creole and the local variety of\nFrench. Everyone speaks the former, but those at the \u2018upper\u2019 levels of Haitian\nsociety also speak French. There are also varieties of the creole, the krey\u00f2l\nfransize (\u2018French creole\u2019) or krey\u00f2l swa (\u2018smooth creole\u2019) of the educated, urban,\nbilingual upper class and the gwo krey\u00f2l (\u2018vulgar creole\u2019) or krey\u00f2l r\u00e8k (\u2018rough\ncreole\u2019) of the rest of the people. The creole is associated with ignorance, pov-\nerty, and inferiority, even by those who speak it, but at the same time it is a\nmarker of Haitian solidarity: it is what makes Haitians distinctively Haitians.\nFrench, though quite alien to well over three-quarters of the population, is the\npreferred language of education and it also provides access to the outside world\n(although recently English has been making inroads). Those who haveknowledge\nof French regard it as the language of culture even though, by the standards of\nContinental French, the Haitian variety of French tends to be grandiose, flowery,\nand archaic. The result, predictably, is that little or no progress is made in Haiti\nin solving pressing social and educational problems. Many of these are directly\nrelated to linguistic matters so it is not surprising that they should be as severe\nas they are if we remember that the creole is said to have no grammar, that the\nelite have long resisted literacy campaigns (there was only 20 percent literacy in\n1984!), and that it was not until 1961 that the creole gained any limited official\nrecognition at all and not until 1979 that it became the medium of instruction\nfor the first four years of schooling (see also pp. 91\u20132).\nJamaica might appear to offer more hope that a unified language will evolve.\nHowever, the subtle gradations that exist in a continuum can also be put to use\nto classify people. The people who use the two ends of the Jamaican continuum\nare almost as far apart socially as those Haitians who speak only Haitian Creole\nare from those who are completely bilingual in the creole and French. Some\nvarieties of Jamaican English are clearly felt to be \u2018superior\u2019 and others clearly\n\u2018inferior,\u2019 so the particular span of varieties a Jamaican uses serves as a clear\nsocial class marker. DeCamp (1977, p. 26) has pointed out some of the serious\nAITC03 84 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 85\neducational consequences of such attitudes. He says that in Jamaica \u2018most edu-\ncators persist in treating the \u201cdialect problem\u201d as if it were a problem of speech\ncorrection, attributing it to careless, slovenly pronunciation....The creole is\ninseparably associated with poverty, ignorance, and lack of moral character.\u2019\nThere is a strong social prejudice against the creole, a prejudice which inhibits\neven the middle class, many of whom \u2018lead lives of desperate linguistic anxiety,\nloudly proclaiming the superiority of their own \u201cstandard\u201d English whilenursing\ninward doubts about whether their English is really sufficiently standard.\u2019\nWassink\u2019s study (1999) of speakers from the semi-rural community of Gordon\nTown outside Kingston, Jamaica, revealed that some of the negative attitudes\ntoward the existence of a continuum may be weakening. There is stillconsiderable\nambivalence about what locals call the patois: for example, respondents weremore\nwilling to hear it used by others than they were to use it themselves. Youngpeople\nwere also more accepting than old. \u2018Gordon Town respondents maintained\nreservations about JC [Jamaican Creole] but they also indicated that it has great\nsocial value to them...[it] being more expressive than English\u2019 (p. 85).\nThis problem is no longer unique to Jamaica. In recent decades there has been\nconsiderable emigration from Jamaica (and from other countries in which the\nsame kind of continuum is normal), so that a further dimension has been added\nto the continuum: a new standard is superposed on the previous Jamaican one,\ne.g., British English or Canadian English. How best to deal with the social and\neducational factors associated with a continuum is no longer a problem unique\nto certain places where creoles have developed, but is now a problem for edu-\ncators in cities like London, Toronto, and New York. Edwards (1986) and\nHewitt (1986, 1989) have pointed out how in England black youths of West\nIndian origin not only learn the local variety of English but often too a particu-\nlar variety of Caribbean English that differs from that of their parents. Edwards\nsays that they deliberately recreolize the English they use in an attempt to assert\ntheir ethnic identity and solidarity because of the social situation in which they\nfind themselves (Edwards, 1986, p. 111). Sebba (1993) offers further evidenceof\nthis phenomenon. He shows how some young British African Caribbeans create\nLondon Jamaican English forms that are clearly different from Jamaican Jamai-\ncan English (JJE) forms, e.g., fru for through (JJE tru). For these youngsters this\ntype of creole has covert prestige with its images of solidarity, Black Britishness,\nand distinctiveness from other varieties of English: it is deliberately, oppositionally,\nand nonlegitimately different. We will see too (in chapter 14) that claims have\nbeen advanced that the speech of certain blacks in the United States may now\nbe diverging from that of the wider society.\nCreating a new \u2018full\u2019 language from a creole also has its own special prob-\nlems. Bahasa Indonesia has to be standardized and taught to speakers of many\ndifferent languages. Afrikaans has already been standardized. Both states have\nfound that a strong unifying \u2018national\u2019 consciousness among potential speakers\nhas been of immense value. To some extent Tok Pisin relies on the same motiva-\ntion, but in this case the numbers in support of a new language are small and\nthe price to pay in terms of linguistic isolation, which must be added to the\ngeographic isolation that already exists, is high. Currently Tok Pisin is rapidly\nbeing creolized, particularly in urban areas, and attempts are being made to\nAITC03 85 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 86 Pidgins and Creoles\nstandardize the emerging creole. Its uses are being extended in a variety of ways,\ne.g., in the House of Assembly as an official language alongside English, in\nbroadcasting, in newspapers, and in primary education. However, the process\nhas not been without its problems. One is the growth of varieties of the lan-\nguage, so that there are now both rural and urban varieties, a situation which\nthreatens Tok Pisin\u2019s development as a lingua franca. Another is that there\nhas been wholesale borrowing into Tok Pisin of English words rather than\nthe exploitation of native sources. If Tok Pisin were to become more and more\nrecognizably \u2018English,\u2019 we might anticipate the development of a creole con-\ntinuum with all the attendant problems, not the least of which, of course, is\nthe threat that such a development poses to the native creole, as in Jamaica,\nGuyana, and Nigeria, placing, as it does, that creole in an even more unfavor-\nable light in the eyes of those who speak it. Tok Pisin could fall into jeopardy\nif this should happen.\nDiscussion\n1. While all linguists believe that all languages change over time, some believe\nthat they change at a fairly fixed rate, particularly over very long periods\nof time. This belief enables them not only to reconstruct protolanguages\n(i.e., common ancestral languages) but also to attempt to date these. What\nproblems might the existence of creoles pose for such views?\n2. Hall (1972, p. 151) has commented that the major factor that brings about\na change of status for a pidgin or a creole is \u2018political, i.e., pressure effect-\nively exerted by or on behalf of the population which uses it, for its\nrecognition.\u2019 He adds that the \u2018correlation between political factors and\nstatus-achievement, for pidgins and creoles, is so close that we may expect\nto see other such languages rise to the status of standards only where the\nareas where they are spoken gain political independence or autonomy, and\nuse the local tongue as a symbol of nationality.\u2019 If Hall is correct, what do\nyou think will happen to the many pidgins and creoles that exist today? Are\nthere any countervailing forces which must also be recognized?\n3. Saville-Troike (1989) quotes the following from a letter to the editor of the\nTrinidad Guardian. A report on a Language Arts syllabus had recognized\nthat most Trinidadians spoke a creole and that English was not their native\nlanguage. The letter writer protests as follows:\nIf the language of the barrack yard and the market is to be the accepted mode\nof expression in the school-room...there would be no need for teachers...we\ncould save the high wages of these experts and set them free to go and plant\npeas...where they can give fullvent to this dialect stuff...What, if not\nbroken English, is this dialect?...I feel that such discussions should be banned\nfrom our news media as a most damaging ...exercise.\nWhat might you say in a follow-up letter to the editor of the Guardian?\nAITC03 86 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Pidgins and Creoles 87\n4. Many Jamaicans speak disparagingly of Jamaican creole or \u2018the patois.\u2019 The\nlanguage of education in Jamaica is Standard English. However, much of\nthe teaching of Standard English proves to be ineffective. Why might this\nbe the case?\n5. Todd (1990, p. 83) takes Whinnom (1971, p. 110) severely to task for\nsaying the following:\nI feel that...modern linguists...have been dangerously sentimental about\ncreole languages, which, with only a few notable exceptions, constitute in\nmost communities a distinct handicap to the social mobility of the individual,\nand may also constitute a handicap to the creole speaker\u2019s personal intellectual\ndevelopment.\nRead what each has to say on this matter and try to reach some conclusion\nabout the issues.\nFurther Reading\nVery useful introductory texts on pidgins and creoles are Holm (1988, 1989,\n2000, 2004), M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler (1997), Romaine (1988), Todd (1990), Sebba (1997),\nArends et al. (1995), Kaye and Tosco (2001), and Singh (2000). Aitchison(1994)\nis an excellent brief account. Le Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985) and Morgan\n(1994) deal with interesting issues of identity in creole situations. Winford (2003)\nenlightens on all kinds of language contact, and Lefebvre (2004) discusses many\nof the most pressing issues in pidgin\u2013creole linguistics. Two collections of papers\nilluminate some of the controversies in pidgin and creole studies: Spears and\nWinford (1997) and Thomason (1997).\nThe Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages is an important journal.\nAITC03 87 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 88 Codes\n4 Codes\nAs I indicated in chapter 2, it is possible to refer to a language or a variety of\na language as a code. The term is useful because it is neutral. Terms like dialect,\nlanguage, style, standard language, pidgin, and creole are inclined to arouseemo-\ntions. In contrast, the \u2018neutral\u2019 term code, taken from information theory, can\nbe used to refer to any kind of system that two or more people employ for\ncommunication. (It can actually be used for a system used by a single person,\nas when someone devises a private code to protect certain secrets.) All of the\nabove, then, are codes by this, admittedly loose, definition. What is interesting\nis the factors that govern the choice of a particular code on a particular occa-\nsion. Why do people choose to use one code rather than another, what brings\nabout shifts from one code to another, and why do they occasionally prefer to\nuse a code formed from two other codes by switching back and forth between\nthe two or even mixing them?\nSuch questions as these assume that there are indeed few single-code speakers;\npeople are nearly always faced with choosing an appropriate code when they\nspeak. Very young children may be exceptions, as may learners of a new lan-\nguage (for a while at least) and the victims of certain pathological conditions.\nIn general, however, when you open your mouth, you must choose a particular\nlanguage, dialect, style, register, or variety \u2013 that is, a particular code. You\ncannot avoid doing so. Moreover, you can and will shift, as the need arises,\nfrom one code to another. Within each code there will also be the possibility of\nchoices not all of which will have the same import because some will be more\nmarked than others, i.e., will be more significant. The various choices will have\ndifferent social meanings. What are some of the factors that influence the choices\nyou make?\nWe will look mainly at the phenomenon of code-switching in bilingual and\nmultilingual situations. However, many of the issues that we will see there\nwill also arise with those codes which can be called sub-varieties of a single\nlanguage, e.g., dialects, styles, and registers. In particular, we will examine the\nso-called diglossic situation in which clear functional differences between the\ncodes govern the choice. Following a brief look at some types of bilingual situ-\nations, we will consider code-switching as a phenomenon that requires serious\nexplanation.\nAITC04 88 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 89\nDiscussion\n1. Use of the term code allows us to use derivative terms like codification and\nrecodification. Writing systems are said to be codifications of speech. How\ndo the English and Chinese writing systems differ as codifications of their\nrespective languages?\n2. A recodification is a further manipulation of a code. Morse Code and Pig\nLatin are two simple recodifications. What are the principles behind each?\n3. Some codifications or recodifications have very clear social functions. You\nmight care to look at the following from such a perspective: Walbiri \u2018up-\nside-down talk\u2019 (Hale, 1971); Hanun\u00f3o \u2018love play\u2019 (Conklin, 1959); and\nglossolalia (Samarin, 1973).\nDiglossia\nA diglossic situation exists in a society when it has two distinct codes which\nshow clear functional separation; that is, one code is employed in one set of\ncircumstances and the other in an entirely different set. Ferguson (1959, p. 336)\nhas defined diglossia as follows:\ndiglossia is a relatively stable language situation in which, in addition to the\nprimary dialects of the language (which may include a standard or regional stand-\nards), there is a very divergent, highly codified (often grammatically more complex)\nsuperposed variety, the vehicle of a large and respected body of written literature,\neither of an earlier period or in another speech community, which is learned largely\nby formal education and is used for most written and formal spoken purposes but\nis not used by any sector of the community for ordinary conversation.\nIn the same article he identifies four language situations which show the major\ncharacteristics of the diglossic phenomenon: Arabic, Swiss German, Haitian\n(French and Creole), and Greek. In each situation there is a \u2018high\u2019 variety (H)of\nlanguage and a \u2018low\u2019 variety (L). Each variety has its own specialized functions,\nand each is viewed differently by those who are aware of both.\nIn the Arabic situation the two varieties are Classical Arabic (H) and the\nvarious regional colloquial varieties (L). In Switzerland they are StandardGerman\n(H) and Swiss German (L). In Haiti the varieties are Standard French (H) and\nHaitian Creole (L). In Greece they are the Kathar\u00e9vousa (H) and Dhimotiki, or\nDemotic (L), varieties of Greek. In each case the two varieties have coexisted\nfor a long period, sometimes, as in the case of Arabic, for many centuries. Con-\nsequently, the phenomenon of diglossia is not ephemeral in nature; in fact, the\nopposite is true: it appears to be a persistent social and linguistic phenomenon.\nA key defining characteristic of diglossia is that the two varieties are kept\nquite apart in their functions. One is used in one set of circumstances and the\nAITC04 89 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 90 Codes\nother in an entirely different set. For example, the H varieties may be used for\ndelivering sermons and formal lectures, especially in a parliament or legislative\nbody, for giving political speeches, for broadcasting the news on radio and\ntelevision, and for writing poetry, fine literature, and editorials in newspapers.\nIn contrast, the L varieties may be used in giving instructions to workers in low-\nprestige occupations or to household servants, in conversation with familiars, in\n\u2018soap operas\u2019 and popular programs on the radio, in captions on political car-\ntoons in newspapers, and in \u2018folk literature.\u2019 On occasion, a person may lecture\nin an H variety but answer questions about its contents or explain parts of it\nin an L variety so as to ensure understanding.\nYou do not use an H variety in circumstances calling for an L variety, e.g.,\nfor addressing a servant; nor do you usually use an L variety when an H is\ncalled for, e.g., for writing a \u2018serious\u2019 work of literature. You may indeed do the\nlatter, but it may be a risky endeavor; it is the kind of thing that Chaucer did\nfor the English of his day, and it requires a certain willingness, on the part of\nboth the writer and others, to break away from a diglossic situation by extend-\ning the L variety into functions normally associated only with the H. For about\nthree centuries after the Norman Conquest of 1066, English and Norman French\ncoexisted in England in a diglossic situation with Norman French the H variety\nand English the L. However, gradually the L variety assumed more and more\nfunctions associated with the H so that by Chaucer\u2019s time it had become pos-\nsible to use the L variety for a major literary work.\nThe H variety is the prestigious, powerful variety; the L variety lacks prestige\nand power. In fact, there may be so little prestige attached to the L variety that\npeople may even deny that they know it although they may be observed to use\nit far more frequently than the H variety. Associated with this prestige valuation\nfor the H variety, there is likely to be a strong feeling that the prestige is\ndeserved because the H variety is more beautiful, logical, and expressive than\nthe L variety. That is why it is deemed appropriate for literary use, for religious\npurposes, and so on. There may also be considerable and widespread resistance\nto translating certain books into the L variety, e.g., the Qur\u2019an into one or other\ncolloquial varieties of Arabic or the Bible into Haitian Creole or Demotic Greek.\n(We should note that even today many speakers of English resist the Bible in any\nform other than the King James version.)\nThis last feeling concerning the natural superiority of the H variety is likely\nto be reinforced by the fact that a considerable body of literature will be found\nto exist in that variety and almost none in the other. That literature may also\nbe regarded as reflecting essential values about the culture and, when parts of\nit are classical literature, deemed worthy of recalling by allusion and quotations\non occasions suitable for the employment of H. Speakers of Arabic in particular\ngain prestige from being able to allude to classical sources. The folk literature\nassociated with the L variety will have none of the same prestige; it may interest\nfolklorists and it may be transmuted into an H variety by writers skilled in H,\nbut it is unlikely to be the stuff of which literary histories and traditions are\nmade in its \u2018raw\u2019 form.\nAnother important difference between the H and L varieties is that all chil-\ndren learn the L variety. Some may concurrently learn the H variety, but many\nAITC04 90 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 91\ndo not learn it at all; e.g., most Haitians have no knowledge at all of Standard\nFrench but all can speak some variety of Haitian Creole, although some, as I\nhave said, may deny that they have this ability. The H variety is also likely to\nbe learned in some kind of formal setting, e.g., in classrooms or as part of a\nreligious or cultural indoctrination. To that extent, the H variety is \u2018taught,\u2019\nwhereas the L variety is \u2018learned.\u2019 Teaching requires the availability ofgrammars,\ndictionaries, standardized texts, and some widely accepted view about thenature\nof what is being taught and how it is most effectively to be taught. There are\nusually no comparable grammars, dictionaries, and standardized texts for the L\nvariety, and any view of that variety is likely to be highly pejorative in nature.\nWhen such grammars and other aids do exist, they have in many cases been\nwritten by outsiders, e.g., \u2018foreign\u2019 linguists. They are also likely to be neither\nwell known to the people whose linguistic usage they describe nor well received\nby those people, since such works are unlikely to support some of the myths\nthat accompany diglossia, particularly the myth that the L variety lacks any kind\nof \u2018grammar.\u2019\nThe L variety often shows a tendency to borrow learned words from the H\nvariety, particularly when speakers try to use the L variety in more formal ways.\nThe result is a certain admixture of H vocabulary into the L. On otheroccasions,\nthough, there may be distinctly different pairs of words, i.e., doublets, in the H and\nL varieties to refer to very common objects and concepts. Since the domains ofuse\nof the two varieties do not intersect, there will be an L word for use in Lsituations\nand an H word for use in H situations with no possibility of transferring theone\nto the other. So far as the pronunciation of the two varieties is concerned, the\nL system will often appear to be the more \u2018basic.\u2019 However, actual circumstances\ncan vary. Whereas the two varieties of Greek have very similar sound systems,\nthere is a considerable difference between Classical Arabic and the colloquial\nvarieties and a still greater difference between High German and Swiss German.\nDiglossia is a widespread phenomenon in the world, well attested in both\nspace (e.g., varieties of Tamil in the south of India) and time (e.g., Latin in\nEurope in the Middle Ages). According to Ferguson (1959, p. 338), it is likely\nto come into being when (1) \u2018there is a sizable body of literature in a language\nclosely related to (or even identical with) the natural language of the community\n...[and when (2)] literacy in the community is limited to a small elite, [and]\n...a suitable period of time, of the order of several centuries, passes from the\nestablishment of (1) and (2).\u2019 People living in a diglossic community do not\nusually regard diglossia as a \u2018problem.\u2019 It becomes a problem only when there\nis a growth of literacy, or when there is a desire to decrease regional and\/or\nsocial barriers, or when a need is seen for a unified \u2018national\u2019 language.\nIn Haiti, any attempt to develop literacy had to confront directly the issue\nof whether to increase the amount of Standard French taught or to \u2018elevate\u2019 the\nL variety, Haitian Creole, into a national language. Haitian Creole was eventu-\nally recognized as a national language in 1983, with prestigious French, of\ncourse, the other. Both languages were made official in 1987. There has been an\nongoing debate about the most appropriate orthography (spelling system) for\nHaitian Creole: about the use of certain letters and accents, and about whether\nthe differences between French and Haitian Creole should be minimized in the\nAITC04 91 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 92 Codes\northography for Haitian Creole or whether that orthography should be as trans-\nparent as possible in relating letters to sounds, particularly the sounds of the\nmost widespread variety of Haitian Creole. French, though not widely used, has\nsuch prestige that, according to Schieffelin and Doucet (1998, p. 306) virtually\nany proposal for an othography for krey\u00f2l has created \u2018resistance both to the\nadoption of the orthography and to the use of krey\u00f2l as a medium of instruction\nin school. The double resistance comes from both the masses and the educated\nelite minority. The masses see the officialization of written and spoken krey\u00f2l in\nschool as limiting their access to French and, consequently, their social and\neconomic mobility. The elites, who already know krey\u00f2l, do not see the point\nof teaching it, in any form, in school.\u2019\nThe Greeks have still not entirely solved the problems associated with their\ntwo varieties: \u2018conservative\u2019 Greeks want to resolve any differences in favor of\nthe H variety, but \u2018liberals\u2019 favor the L variety. (It was at one time said that you\ncould judge a Greek\u2019s social and political attitudes by the way he or she declined\nthird-declension nouns!) The twentieth century witnessed a long and sometimes\nbitter struggle between supporters of the two varieties. Religious authorities\ncondemned a 1921 translation of the New Testament into Demotic Greek and\nthis action led to rioting in the streets of Athens. One consequence of the\nlanguage disagreement was that, when the \u2018liberal\u2019 government of the 1960s was\noverthrown by the \u2018colonels\u2019 in 1967, the former government\u2019s program to extend\nthe uses of Dhimotiki was superseded by restoration of use of the H variety,\nKathar\u00e9vousa, for example in education, and the suppression of Dhimotiki\nbecause of its association with \u2018left-wing\u2019 views. With the return to constitutional\ngovernment in 1975 the H was superseded in turn by the L, Dhimotiki was\ndeclared the official language of Greece in 1976, and Kathar\u00e9vousa disappeared\nalmost entirely from public view. The new model for Greece seems to be based\non the variety spoken in Athens. Today, the opponents of this new Greeklanguage\nbased on the L variety attack it for being impoverished and cut off from its\nroots, which are said to be the former H variety and Ancient Greek (Frangoudaki,\n1992). Tseronis (2002) says that the two most recent Greek dictionaries,\nthe Dictionary of Modern Greek Language (DOMGL) and the Dictionary of\nCommon Modern Greek (DOCMG) show that the process of standardization\ncontinues. The DOMGL finds its roots in Kathar\u00e9vousa and the DOCMG\nin Dhimotiki. However, both point to eventual unification around the variety\nspoken in Athens and an end to the H\u2013L division.\nThe linguistic situations in Haiti and Greece are intimately tied to power\nrelationships among social groups. Traditionally, in each country the H variety\nhas been associated with an elite and the L variety with everyone else. Diglossia\nreinforces social distinctions. It is used to assert social position and to keep\npeople in their place, particularly those at the lower end of the social hierarchy.\nAny move to extend the L variety, even in the case of Haiti to make the\npopulation literate in any variety, is likely to be perceived to be a direct threat\nto those who want to maintain traditional relationships and the existing power\nstructure.\nThe following example from Trudgill (1995, pp. 101\u20132) shows how different\nthe Z\u00fcrich variety of Swiss German is from High German:\nAITC04 92 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 93\nLow variety \u2013 Swiss German\nEn Schwyzer isch er zwaar nie woorde, weder en papiirige na \u00e4ine im H\u00eb\u00ebrz ine;\nund eebigs h\u00e4d mer syner Spraach aagm2rkt, das er n\u00fcd daa uufgwachsen ischt.\nN\u00fcd nu s Muul h\u00e4d Ussl\u00e4nder verraate, au syni M\u00f6\u00f6dteli. Er h\u00e4d lieber mit syne\nt\u00fc\u00fctsche Landsl\u00fc\u00fcte weder mit de Yh\u00e4imische vercheert, und ischt Mitgliid und\nZaalm\u00e4ischter von irem Ver\u00e4in gsy.\nHigh variety \u2013 Standard German\nEin Schweizer ist er zwar nie geworden, weder auf dem Papier noch im Herzen;\nund man hat es seine Sprache angemerkt, dass er nicht dort aufgewachsen ist.\nNicht nur die Sprache hat den Ausl\u00e4nder verraten, sondern auch seine Gewohnheiten.\nEr hat lieber mit seinen deutschen Landsleuten als mit den Einheimischen verkehrt,\nund ist Mitglied und Zahlmeister ihres Vereins gewesen.\nEnglish\nHe never actually became Swiss, neither on paper nor in his heart; and you could\ntell from his language that he had not grown up there. It was not only his language\nthat showed that he was a foreigner \u2013 his way of life showed it too. He preferred\nto associate with his German compatriots rather than with the natives, and was a\nmember and the treasurer of their society.\nSwiss German diglossia has its own stabilizing factors. Switzerland is a multi-\nlingual country, with German, French, and Italian its three official languages.\nStrong constitutional protection is provided for German, the H variety of which\nis taught in the schools and used in official publications, newspapers, literature,\nand church services. This allows the German Swiss to communicate withspeakers\nof German elsewhere in Europe and gives them access to everything written in\nStandard German. However, the Germans in Switzerland can also assert their\nindependence of other Germans through use of their L variety. This is their own\ndistinctive unifying spoken variety of German, one in which they take a special\npride. The continuation of the High German\u2013Swiss diglossic situation depends\nevery much on the continued effectiveness of educating Swiss German children\nto use High German in the schools so as to encourage diglossia there. Some\nSwiss do worry that such teaching of High German may not always produce the\ndesired results and that any quest for identity through increased use of Swiss\nGerman might lead to growing cultural isolation from other users of German.\nIn much the same way, the people of Luxembourg have achieved a certain\ndistinctiveness with their own diglossic \u2013 or better still, triglossic \u2013 situation (see\nNewton, 1996). In this case Luxemburgish, called L\u00ebtzebuergesch, a variety of\nGerman, is the L variety and Standard German is the H variety. The following\nexamples are from Trudgill (1995, p. 103):\nLuxemburgish\nW\u00e9i de Rodange 1872 s\u00e4i Buch dr\u00e9cke gelooss huet, du bluf hien drop s\u00ebtzen.

Seine Kinder haben es wenigstens noch erlebt, dass 1927 ein\nwenig von dem gut gemacht wurde, was an ihm verbrochen worden war!\nEnglish\nWhen Rodange had his book printed in 1872 he had no success with it. With too\nmuch intrigue he had trodden on some people\u2019s toes, and they could not forgive\nhim that. Only a generation later did Rodange begin to receive his rightful place.\nHis children at least experienced the making good, in 1927, of some of the wrong\nthat had been done him.\nHowever, the situation is a little more complicated in Luxembourg than in\nSwitzerland because still another language, French, is involved. All threelanguages\n\u2013 German, French, and Luxemburgish \u2013 have been official languages since 1984.\nInhabitants of Luxembourg not only use Luxemburgish (e.g., in ordinary con-\nversation) and Standard German (e.g., in letter writing, books, and newspapers),\nbut they also use French (e.g., in parliament and higher education) \u2013 see Clyne\n(1984, pp. 20\u20131). Moreover, they frequently borrow words from French for\nuse in Luxemburgish. Consequently, it is not unusual for a speaker of Standard\nGerman who goes to live in Luxembourg to feel that Luxemburgish is a variety\nof French rather than a variety of German! French is highly regarded in Luxem-\nbourg and is also the most widely used language (by 96 percent of residents),\nalthough 81 percent can speak German and 80 percent can speak Luxemburgish\n(Fehlen, 2002, p. 91). However, the clear marker of Luxembourg identity among\nLuxembourgers is their use of Luxemburgish; it is a solidarity marker just as is\nthe use of Swiss German among Swiss Germans.\nThe Arabic situation is very different again. There are a number of flourishing\nregional varieties of the L and many Arabs would like to see the Arab-speaking\nworld unify around one variety. They acknowledge the highly restricted uses\nof the H variety, but also revere it for certain characteristics that they ascribe\nto it: its beauty, logic, and richness. Classical Arabic is also the language of the\nQur\u2019an. Ferguson has pointed out that choosing one colloquial variety of Arabic\nto elevate above all others poses a number of problems. Almost certainly, any\nArab will tell you that the variety he or she speaks is the \u2018best,\u2019 so there would\nbe considerable disagreement about where one should begin any attempt to\nstandardize modern Arabic on a single colloquial variety. There is, however, a\nconsensus among Arabs that any standard that may eventually emerge will bea\nversion of the H variety developed to meet modern needs and purged of regional\npeculiarities and foreign impurities.\nWhile acknowledging that diglossic situations are essentially stable, Ferguson\ndid predict (1959, p. 340) what he thought the future held for the situations he\nAITC04 94 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 95\nexamined. He regarded the situation in Switzerland as relatively stable. The\nArabic one seemed to point to the development of several regional standard\nvarieties of Arabic, each using a considerable amount of vocabulary drawn from\nClassical Arabic. In Haiti, there would be a slow development of Haitian Creole\nbased on the L variety of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Finally, in Greece thestandard\nwould be based on the L variety of Athens with considerable admixture of\nvocabulary from Kathar\u00e9vousa.\nWhat Ferguson describes are \u2018narrow\u2019 or \u2018classic\u2019 diglossic situations. They\nrequire the use of very divergent varieties of the same language and there arefew\ngood examples. Fishman has broadened or extended the term to include a wider\nvariety of language situations. For Fishman (1980, p. 3) diglossia is \u2018an enduring\nsocietal arrangement, extending at least beyond a three generation period, such\nthat two \u201clanguages\u201d each have their secure, phenomenologically legitimate and\nwidely implemented functions.\u2019 By acknowledging that his use of the term\nlanguage also includes sub-varieties of one language, Fishman includes Ferguson\u2019s\nexamples. He does add, though, that in the case of two varieties of the same\nlanguage, they be \u2018sufficiently different from one another that, withoutschooling,\nthe elevated variety cannot be understood by speakers of the vernacular\u2019 (p. 4).\nFishman\u2019s proposal extends the concept of \u2018diglossia\u2019 to include bilingual and\nmultilingual situations in which the different languages have quite different\nfunctions. For example, one language is used in one set of circumstances and the\nother in an entirely different set and such difference is felt to be normal and\nproper. Fishman gives examples such as Biblical Hebrew and Yiddish for many\nJews, Spanish and Guaran\u00ed in Paraguay, and even Standard English and Carib-\nbean Creole. I will have more to say about code choices in such situations in the\nfollowing sections.\nDiscussion\n1. In what ways was the relationship between Classical Latin and the vernacu-\nlar Romance languages, particularly the languages presently known as French,\nItalian, Spanish, and Portuguese, a diglossic one for a number of centuries?\nAt which point did diglossia cease? Can we answer this last question with\nany great degree of precision?\n2. The history of English in the three centuries after 1066 is of considerable\ninterest. The Norman Conquest established Norman French as the H vari-\nety and English as the L variety. What caused English eventually to triumph\nand French to be eliminated from use in England (except as a clearly marked\n\u2018foreign\u2019 language)? Where did Latin fit into the overall picture?\n3. There was, and still is, among certain ultra-orthodox sects in Israel resist-\nance to the use of Biblical Hebrew as a vernacular language, that is, as a\nlanguage of everyday living, because they regard such use as \u2018profane.\u2019 How\ndifferent are Biblical and Modern Hebrew?\n4. If someone were to tell you that diglossia is but a simple reflection of\nthe social, cultural, or political oppression of a people, how might you\nanswer?\nAITC04 95 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 96 Codes\n5. How \u2018diglossic\u2019 are classroom situations in which children who come to\nschool speaking only a regional or social variety of English well removed\nfrom the standard variety are taught the standard variety and its various\nuses, particularly its use in writing?\nBilingualism and Multilingualism\nMonolingualism, that is, the ability to use only one language, is such a widely\naccepted norm in so many parts of the Western world that it is often assumed\nto be a world-wide phenomenon, to the extent that bilingual and multilingual\nindividuals may appear to be \u2018unusual.\u2019 Indeed, we often have mixed feelings\nwhen we discover that someone we meet is fluent in several languages: perhaps\na mixture of admiration and envy but also, occasionally, a feeling of superiority\nin that many such people are not \u2018native\u2019 to the culture in which we function.\nSuch people are likely to be immigrants, visitors, or children of \u2018mixed\u2019marriages\nand in that respect \u2018marked\u2019 in some way, and such marking is not alwaysregarded\nfavorably.\nHowever, in many parts of the world an ability to speak more than one lan-\nguage is not at all remarkable. In fact, a monolingual individual would beregarded\nas a misfit, lacking an important skill in society, the skill of being able to interact\nfreely with the speakers of other languages with whom regular contact is made\nin the ordinary business of living. In many parts of the world it is just a normal\nrequirement of daily living that people speak several languages: perhaps one or\nmore at home, another in the village, still another for purposes of trade, and yet\nanother for contact with the outside world of wider social or politicalorganization.\nThese various languages are usually acquired naturally and unselfconsciously,\nand the shifts from one to another are made without hesitation.\nPeople who are bilingual or multilingual do not necessarily have exactly the\nsame abilities in the languages (or varieties); in fact, that kind of parity may be\nexceptional. As Sridhar (1996, p. 50) says, \u2018multilingualism involving balanced,\nnativelike command of all the languages in the repertoire is rather uncommon.\nTypically, multilinguals have varying degrees of command of the different rep-\nertoires. The differences in competence in the various languages might range\nfrom command of a few lexical items, formulaic expressions such as greetings,\nand rudimentary conversational skills all the way to excellent command of the\ngrammar and vocabulary and specialized register and styles.\u2019 Sridhar adds:\n\u2018Multilinguals develop competence in each of the codes to the extent that they\nneed it and for the contexts in which each of the languages is used.\u2019 Context\ndetermines language choice. In a society in which more than one language (or\nvariety) is used you must find out who uses what, when, and for what purpose\nif you are to be socially competent. Your language choices are part of the social\nidentity you claim for yourself.\nIn the previous paragraph I have referred to varieties as well as languages in\ndiscussing the issues that concern us. This is a consequence of the difficulties of\nAITC04 96 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 97\ntrying to distinguish languages from dialects and among dialects themselves.\nConsequently, attempts to distinguish people who are bilingual from those who\nare bidialectal may fail. There may be some doubt that very many people are\nactually bi- or even multi-dialectal. They may speak varieties which are dis-\ntinctly different, but whether each separate variety is genuinely a dialect depends\non how one defines dialect, which, as we saw in chapter 2, is not at all an easy\nmatter to decide. So it sometimes is too with deciding who is or who is not\nbilingual. Is someone who speaks both Hindi and Urdu bilingual, who speaks\nboth Serbian and Croatian, Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l, or Russian and Ukrainian?\nSuch speakers may well tell you they are. But, on the other hand, a Chinese who\nspeaks both Mandarin and Cantonese will almost certainly insist that he or she\nspeaks only two dialects of Chinese, just as an Arab who knows both a collo-\nquial variety and the classical, literary variety of Arabic will insist that they are\nonly different varieties of the same language. In some cases, then, the bilingual\u2013\nbidialectal distinction that speakers make reflects social, cultural, and political\naspirations or realities rather than any linguistic reality. What we will concern\nourselves with, then, are unequivocal cases in which there can be no doubt that\nthe two languages, or codes, are mutually unintelligible.\nAn interesting example of multilingualism exists among the Tukano of the\nnorthwest Amazon, on the border between Colombia and Brazil (Sorensen,1971).\nThe Tukano are a multilingual people because men must marry outside their\nlanguage group; that is, no man may have a wife who speaks his language, for\nthat kind of marriage relationship is not permitted and would be viewed as a\nkind of incest. Men choose the women they marry from various neighboring\ntribes who speak other languages. Furthermore, on marriage, women move into\nthe men\u2019s households or longhouses. Consequently, in any village severallanguages\nare used: the language of the men; the various languages spoken by women who\noriginate from different neighboring tribes; and a widespread regional \u2018trade\u2019\nlanguage. Children are born into this multilingual environment: the child\u2019sfather\nspeaks one language, the child\u2019s mother another, and other women with whom\nthe child has daily contact perhaps still others. However, everyone in the com-\nmunity is interested in language learning so most people can speak most of the\nlanguages. Multilingualism is taken for granted, and moving from one language\nto another in the course of a single conversation is very common. In fact, multi-\nlingualism is so usual that the Tukano are hardly conscious that they do speak\ndifferent languages as they shift easily from one to another. They cannot readily\ntell an outsider how many languages they speak, and must be suitably prompted\nto enumerate which languages they speak and to describe how well they speak\neach one.\nMultilingualism is a norm in this community. It results from the pattern of\nmarriage and the living arrangements consequent to marriage. Communities\nare multilingual and no effort is made to suppress the variety of languages that\nare spoken. It is actually seen as a source of strength, for it enables the speakers\nof the various linguistic communities to maintain contact with one another and\nprovides a source for suitable marriage partners for those who seek them. A\nman cannot marry one of his \u2018sisters,\u2019 i.e., women whose mother tongue is the\nsame as his. People are not \u2018strangers\u2019 to one another by reason of the fact that\nAITC04 97 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 98 Codes\nthey cannot communicate when away from home. When men from one village\nvisit another village, they are likely to find speakers of their native language.\nThere will almost certainly be some women from the \u2018home\u2019 village who have\nmarried into the village being visited, possibly even a sister. The children of these\nwomen, too, will be fluent in their mothers\u2019 tongue. Many others also will have\nlearned some of it because it is considered proper to learn to use the languages\nof those who live with you.\nSomewhat similar attitudes toward multilingualism have been reported from\nother parts of the world. For example, Salisbury (1962) reports that among\nthe Siane of New Guinea it is quite normal for people to know a number of\nlanguages. They choose the most appropriate one for the particularcircumstances\nin which they find themselves. Moreover, they prize language learning, so that,\nwhen someone who speaks a language they do not know enters a community,\npeople in the community will try to learn as much as they can about thelanguage\nand to find occasions to use their learning. Salisbury specifically mentions the\ninterest taken in pidgin English when a group of laborers returned from service\non the coast; almost immediately a school was established so that the rest of the\nvillage males could learn the pidgin.\nWe have no reason to assume that such situations as these are abnormal in\nany way. In many parts of the world people speak a number of languages and\nindividuals may not be aware of how many different languages they speak. They\nspeak them because they need to do so in order to live their lives: their know-\nledge is instrumental and pragmatic. In such situations language learning comes\nnaturally and is quite unforced. Bilingualism or multilingualism is not at all\nremarkable. To be a proper Tukano or Siane you must be multilingual and a\nskilled user of the languages you know; that is an essential part of your Tukano\nor Siane identity.\nA different kind of bilingual situation exists in Paraguay (see Rubin, 1968).\nBecause of its long isolation from Spain and the paucity of its Spanish-speaking\npopulation, an American Indian language, Guaran\u00ed, has flourished in Paraguay\nto the extent that today it is the mother tongue of about 90 percent of the popu-\nlation and a second language of several additional percent. Guaran\u00ed isrecognized\nas a national language. On the other hand, Spanish, which is the sole language\nof less than 7 percent of the population, is the official language of government\nand the medium of education, although in recent years some use has been made\nof Guaran\u00ed in primary education. In the 1951 census just over half thepopulation\nwere bilingual in Guaran\u00ed and Spanish. These figures indicate that the lesser-\nknown language in Paraguay is Spanish. The capital city, Asunci\u00f3n, is almost\nentirely bilingual, but the further one goes into the countryside away from cities\nand towns the more monolingually Guaran\u00ed-speaking the population becomes.\nSpanish and Guaran\u00ed exist in a relationship that Fishman (1980) calls\u2018extended\ndiglossic\u2019 in which Spanish is the H variety and Guaran\u00ed the L variety. Spanish\nis the language used on formal occasions; it is always used in governmentbusiness,\nin conversation with strangers who are well dressed, with foreigners, and in\nmost business transactions. People use Guaran\u00ed, however, with friends, servants,\nand strangers who are poorly dressed, in the confessional, when they tell jokes\nor make love, and on most casual occasions. Spanish is the preferred language\nAITC04 98 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 99\nof the cities, but Guaran\u00ed is preferred in the countryside, and the lower classes\nalmost always use it for just about every purpose in rural areas.\nParents may attempt to help their children improve their knowledge ofSpanish\nby using Spanish in their presence, for, after all, Spanish is the language of\neducational opportunity and is socially preferred. But between themselves and\nwith their children absent they will almost certainly switch to Guaran\u00ed. In the\nupper classes males may well use Guaran\u00ed with one another as a sign of friend-\nship; upper-class females prefer Spanish in such circumstances. OutsideParaguay,\nParaguayans may deliberately choose to converse in Guaran\u00ed to show their\nsolidarity, particularly when among other South American Spanish-speaking\npeople. Males may drink in Guaran\u00ed but use more and more Spanish as they feel\nthe influence of alcohol, for Spanish is the language of power. Spanish may also\nbe the language they choose to use when addressing superiors, and there may\nbe some conflict in choosing between Spanish and Guaran\u00ed in addressing parents\nor grandparents. In such situations solidarity tends to win over power andGuaran\u00ed\nis often the choice. Courtship may begin in Spanish but, if it goes anywhere, it\nwill proceed in Guaran\u00ed. Men tell jokes and talk about women and sports in\nGuaran\u00ed, but they discuss business affairs in Spanish.\nWe can see, therefore, that the choice between Spanish and Guaran\u00ed depends\non a variety of factors: location (city or country), formality, gender, status,intimacy,\nseriousness, and type of activity. The choice of one code rather than the other\nis obviously related to situation. Paraguay identity requires you to be attuned\nto the uses of Spanish and Guaran\u00ed, to be aware that they \u2018mean\u2019 differentthings,\nand that it is not only what you say that is important but which language you\nchoose to say it in.\nIn Papua New Guinea there are many languages and an increasingly used\nlingua franca, Tok Pisin. Many people are plurilingual. The Yimas of PapuaNew\nGuinea use their own language in traditional pursuits and Tok Pisin for topics\nfrom the encroaching outside world. Domestic matters and local food provision,\nlargely the province of females, call for Yimas just as do mortuary feasts, the\nprovince of males. But matters to do with government, trade, and travel require\nTok Pisin. Language choice among the Yimas is dependent on occasion: Yimas\nto perform traditional practices and Tok Pisin to establish identity within a\nwider community.\nWhat I have tried to stress in this section is that bilingualism and multilingual-\nism are normal in many parts of the world and that people in those parts would\nview any other situation as strange and limiting. There is a long history in\ncertain Western societies of people actually \u2018looking down\u2019 on those who are\nbilingual. We give prestige to only a certain few classical languages (e.g., Greek\nand Latin) or modern languages of high culture (e.g., English, French, Italian,\nand German). You generally get little credit for speaking Swahili and, until\nrecently at least, not much more for speaking Russian, Japanese, Arabic, or\nChinese. Bilingualism is actually sometimes regarded as a problem in that many\nbilingual individuals tend to occupy rather low positions in society and know-\nledge of another language becomes associated with \u2018inferiority.\u2019 Bilingualism is\nsometimes seen as a personal and social problem, not something that has strong\npositive connotations. One unfortunate consequence is that some Westernsocieties\nAITC04 99 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 100 Codes\ngo to great lengths to downgrade, even eradicate, the languages that immigrants\nbring with them while at the same time trying to teach foreign languages in\nschools. What is more, they have had much more success in doing the former\nthan the latter. I will return to this issue in chapter 15, specifically in connection\nwith certain recent developments in the United States.\nA bilingual, or multilingual, situation can produce still other effects on one\nor more of the languages involved. As we have just seen, it can lead to loss, e.g.,\nlanguage loss among immigrants. But sometimes it leads to diffusion; that is,\ncertain features spread from one language to the other (or others) as a result of\nthe contact situation, particularly certain kinds of syntactic features. This phenom-\nenon has been observed in such areas as the Balkans, the south of India, and\nSri Lanka. Gumperz and Wilson (1971) report that in Kupwar, a small village\nof about 3,000 inhabitants in Maharashtra, India, four languages are spoken:\nMarathi and Urdu (both of which are Indo-European) and Kannada (a non-\nIndo-European language). A few people also speak Telugu (also a non-Indo-\nEuropean language). The languages are distributed mainly by caste. The highest\ncaste, the Jains, speak Kannada and the lowest caste, the untouchables, speak\nMarathi. People in different castes must speak to one another and to the Telugu-\nspeaking rope-makers. The Urdu-speaking Muslims must also be fitted in. Bilin-\ngualism or even trilingualism is normal, particularly among the men, but it is\nMarathi which dominates inter-group communication. One linguistic consequence,\nhowever, is that there has been some convergence of the languages that arespoken\nin the village so far as syntax is concerned, but vocabulary differences have been\nmaintained (McMahon, 1994, pp. 214\u201316). It is vocabulary rather than syntax\nwhich now serves to distinguish the groups, and the variety of multilingualism\nthat has resulted is a special local variety which has developed in response to\nlocal needs.\nDiscussion\n1. A distinction is sometimes made between communities in which there is\nstable bilingualism and those in which there is unstable bilingualism;\nSwitzerland, Canada, and Haiti are cited as examples of the former, and the\nlinguistic situations found in cities like New York or among many immi-\ngrant peoples as examples of the latter. Why are the terms stable and un-\nstable useful in such circumstances?\n2. The term bilingual is used in describing countries such as Canada, Belgium,\nand Switzerland (also multilingual in this case). What kind of bilingualism\n(or multilingualism) is this?\n3. A speaker of English who wants to learn another language, particularly an\n\u2018exotic\u2019 one, may find the task difficult. Speakers of that other language may\ninsist on using what little English they know rather than their ownlanguage,\nand there may also be compelling social reasons that prevent the would-be\nlearner from achieving any but a most rudimentary knowledge of the target\nlanguage. What factors contribute to this kind of situation? How might you\nseek to avoid it?\nAITC04 100 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 101\n4. Is it possible to have a society in which everyone is completely bilingual in\nthe same two languages and there is no diglossia? How stable would such\na situation be?\n5. Some communities regard bilingualism as a serious threat; it has even been\nreferred to as a \u2018Trojan horse,\u2019 initially attractive but ultimately fatal. Why\nmight this be so? (Consider the experience of migration and also the sorry\nstate of many minority languages in the world.)\nCode-Switching\nI have observed that the particular dialect or language that a person chooses to\nuse on any occasion is a code, a system used for communication between twoor\nmore parties. I have also indicated that it is unusual for a speaker to havecommand\nof, or use, only one such code or system. Command of only a single variety oflan-\nguage, whether it be a dialect, style, or register, would appear to be an extremely\nrare phenomenon, one likely to occasion comment. Most speakers command\nseveral varieties of any language they speak, and bilingualism, even multilingualism,\nis the norm for many people throughout the world rather than unilingualism.\nPeople, then, are usually required to select a particular code whenever they\nchoose to speak, and they may also decide to switch from one code to another\nor to mix codes even within sometimes very short utterances and thereby create\na new code in a process known as code-switching. Code-switching (also called\ncode-mixing) can occur in conversation between speakers\u2019 turns or within a\nsingle speaker\u2019s turn. In the latter case it can occur between sentences (inter-\nsententially) or within a single sentence (intra-sententially). Code-switching can\narise from individual choice or be used as a major identity marker for a group\nof speakers who must deal with more than one language in their common\npursuits. As Gal (1988, p. 247) says, \u2018codeswitching is a conversational strategy\nused to establish, cross or destroy group boundaries; to create, evoke or change\ninterpersonal relations with their rights and obligations.\u2019 We will now lookmore\nclosely at this phenomenon.\nIn a multilingual country like Singapore, the ability to shift from one language\nto another is accepted as quite normal. Singapore has four official languages:\nEnglish, the Mandarin variety of Chinese, Tamil, and Malay, which is also the\nnational language (see also pp. 371\u20132). However, the majority of its population\nare native speakers of Hokkien, another variety of Chinese. National policy\npromotes English as a trade language, Mandarin as the international \u2018Chinese\u2019\nlanguage, Malay as the language of the region, and Tamil as the language of one\nof the important ethnic groups in the republic. What this means for a \u2018typical\u2019\nChinese child growing up in Singapore is that he or she is likely to speakHokkien\nwith parents and informal Singapore English with siblings. Conversation with\nfriends will be in Hokkien or informal Singapore English. The languages of\neducation will be the formal variety of Singapore English and Mandarin. Any\nreligious practices will be conducted in the formal variety of Singapore English\nAITC04 101 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 102 Codes\nif the family is Christian, but in Hokkien if Buddhist or Taoist. The language\nof government employment will be formal Singapore English but some Man-\ndarin will be used from time to time; however, shopping will be carried on in\nHokkien, informal Singapore English, and the \u2018bazaar\u2019 variety of Malay used\nthroughout the region. (See Platt and Platt, 1975, pp. 91\u20134, for a fuller discus-\nsion.) The linguistic situation in Singapore offers those who live there a wide\nchoice among languages, with the actual choice made on a particular occasion\ndetermined by the kinds of factors just mentioned. (It may even be possible to\ncharacterize the total linguistic situation in Singapore as a complicated diglossic\none if we accept Fishman\u2019s view of diglossia.)\nWe may also ask what happens when people from a multilingual society,people\nwho are themselves multilingual, meet in a \u2018foreign\u2019 setting: what language or\nlanguages do they use? Tanner (1967) reports on the linguistic usage of a small\ngroup of Indonesian graduate students and their families living in the United\nStates. Among them these students knew nine different languages, with nearly\neveryone knowing Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia), Javanese, Dutch, and English.\nThey tended to discuss their academic work in English but used Indonesian\nfor most other common activities. Unlike Javanese, \u2018Indonesian..., whether the\nofficial or the daily variety, is regarded as a neutral, democratic language. A\nspeaker of Indonesian need not commit himself to any particular social identity,\nnor need he impute one to those with whom he converses\u2019 (p. 134). Thestudents\nalso used Dutch, but mainly as a resource, e.g., for vocabulary, or because of\nthe place it necessarily held in certain fields of study, e.g., Indonesian studies.\nLocal languages like Javanese tended to be used only with intimates when fine\nshades of respect or distance were necessary, particularly when in the presence\nof important older people. Tanner\u2019s findings conform to an earlier prediction\nmade by Geertz (1960, p. 259): \u2018Indonesian appeals to those whose sense of\npolitical nationality as Indonesians rather than as Javanese is most developed,\nto those who are interested in the cultural products of the new Indonesia\u2019s\nmass media...and those who wish to take leadership positions in government\nand business.\u2019 He adds that, \u2018although the use of Indonesian for everyday con-\nversation is still mostly confined to the more sophisticated urbanites, and its\nuse suggests something of an air of \u201cpublic speaking\u201d for most Javanese, it is\nrapidly becoming more and more an integral part of their daily cultural life and\nwill become even more so as the present generation of school children grows to\nadulthood.\u2019 Javanese will continue to be used \u2018in certain special contexts and for\ncertain special purposes.\u2019\nSituations such as those just described are not uncommon. In Kenya, local\nlanguages, Swahili, and English all find use and choosing the right language\nto use on a particular occasion can be quite a delicate matter. Whiteley (1984,\npp. 74\u20135) describes the kind of situation that can occur between a member of\nthe public and members of the government bureaucracy:\nA man wishing to see a government officer about renewing a licence may state his\nrequest to the girl typist in Swahili as a suitably neutral language if he does not\nknow her. To start off in English would be unfortunate if she did not know it,\nand on her goodwill depends his gaining access to authority reasonably quickly.\nAITC04 102 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 103\nShe may reply in Swahili, if she knows it as well as he does and wishes to be\nco-operative; or in English, if she is busy and not anxious to be disturbed; or in\nthe local language, if she recognises him and wishes to reduce the level of formality.\nIf he, in return, knows little English, he may be put off at her use of it and decide\nto come back later; or, if he knows it well, he may demonstrate his importance by\ninsisting on an early interview and gain his objective at the expense of the typist\u2019s\ngoodwill. The interview with the officer may well follow a similar pattern, being\nshaped, on the one hand, by the total repertoire mutually available, and on the\nother by their respective positions in relation to the issue involved.\nTrudgill (1995, pp. 108\u201310) describes a situation in Kampala, the capital of\nUganda, which is similar in many respects.\nThe actual choice of code in a setting clearly marked as bilingual can be a\ndifficult task. As Heller (1982) has observed, language plays a symbolic role in\nour lives, and when there is a choice of languages the actual choice may be very\nimportant, particularly when there is a concurrent shift in the relationship\nbetween the languages, as is occurring in Montreal between English and French.\nIn such circumstances, as Heller observes, \u2018negotiation in conversation is a play-\ning out of a negotiation for position in the community at large\u2019 (p. 109). Heller\nstudied the uses of the two languages in a Montreal hospital during the summer\nof 1977. Which language was used varied as circumstances changed. What is\nparticularly interesting is that the pattern that has evolved of asking which\nlanguage someone wishes to use in a public service encounter (\u2018English or French,\nAnglais ou Fran\u00e7ais?\u2019) is not very effective. The reason is that too many other\nfactors are involved to make the choice that simple (p. 118):\nthe negotiation of language has to do with judgments of personal treatment, that\nis, how one expects to be treated in such a situation. But such judgments are\ndependent upon social knowledge, knowledge about group relations and bound-\naries and ways of signalling them, and knowledge about other social differences,\ne.g., status differences.\n...This negotiation itself serves to redefine the situations in the light of ongoing\nsocial and political change. In the absence of norms, we work at creating new ones.\nThe conventionalization of the negotiating strategies appears to be a way of nor-\nmalizing relationships, of encoding social information necessary to know how to\nspeak to someone (and which language to speak is but one aspect of this).\nMost of Heller\u2019s examples show how the conventionalization to which she refers\n\u2013 i.e., asking the other which language is preferred \u2013 often does not work very\nwell in practice. Social and political relationships are too complicated to be\nresolved by such a simple linguistic choice.\nWe can see still other examples of how a speaker may deliberately choose to\nuse a specific language to assert some kind of \u2018right.\u2019 A bilingual (in French and\nEnglish) French Canadian may insist on using French to an official of the fed-\neral government outside Quebec, a bilingual (Catalan and Spanish) resident of\nBarcelona may insist on using Catalan, a bilingual (Welsh and English) resident\nof Wales may insist on using Welsh, and so on. In these cases code choicebecomes\na form of political expression, a move either to resist some other power, or to\ngain power, or to express solidarity.\nAITC04 103 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 104 Codes\nWe are therefore turning to the issue of what brings a speaker to choose\nvariety X of a language A rather than variety Y, or even language A rather than\nlanguage B. What might cause a speaker to switch from variety X to variety Y\nor from language A to language B? A number of answers have been suggested,\nincluding solidarity, accommodation to listeners, choice of topic, and perceived\nsocial and cultural distance. In other words, the motivation of the speaker is an\nimportant consideration in the choice. Moreover, such motivation need not be\nat all conscious, for apparently many speakers are not aware that they have used\none particular variety of a language rather than another or sometimes even that\nthey have switched languages either between or within utterances.\nEquating in this instance code with language, we can describe two kinds of\ncode-switching: situational and metaphorical. Situational code-switching occurs\nwhen the languages used change according to the situations in which the con-\nversants find themselves: they speak one language in one situation and another\nin a different one. No topic change is involved. When a change of topic requires\na change in the language used we have metaphorical code-switching. The inter-\nesting point here is that some topics may be discussed in either code, but the\nchoice of code adds a distinct flavor to what is said about the topic. The choice\nencodes certain social values. Linguists have found it very difficult to explain\nprecisely when, linguistically and socially, code-switching occurs, i.e., what allthe\nconstraints are. However, there is broad agreement about the general principles\nthat are involved.\nInstances of situational code-switching are usually fairly easy to classify for\nwhat they are. What we observe is that one variety is used in a certain set of\nsituations and another in an entirely different set. However, the changeoverfrom\none to the other may be instantaneous. Sometimes the situations are so socially\nprescribed that they can even be taught, e.g., those associated with ceremonial\nor religious functions. Others may be more subtly determined but speakers\nreadily observe the norms. This kind of code-switching differs from diglossia. In\ndiglossic communities the situation also controls the choice of variety but the\nchoice is much more rigidly defined by the particular activity that is involved\nand by the relationship between the participants. Diglossia reinforces differ-\nences, whereas code-switching tends to reduce them. In diglossia too people are\nquite aware that they have switched from H to L or L to H. Code-switching,\non the other hand, is often quite subconscious: people may not be aware that\nthey have switched or be able to report, following a conversation, which code\nthey used for a particular topic.\nAs the term itself suggests, metaphorical code-switching has an affective dimen-\nsion to it: you change the code as you redefine the situation \u2013 formal toinformal,\nofficial to personal, serious to humorous, and politeness to solidarity. In anumber\nof places Gumperz (particularly 1982a) cites examples of metaphorical code-\nswitching from three sets of languages (Hindi and English, Slovenian andGerman,\nand Spanish and English) to show how speakers employ particular languages\nto convey information that goes beyond their actual words, especially to define\nsocial situations. What happens in each case is that one language expresses a\nwe-type solidarity among participants, and is therefore deemed suitable for in-\ngroup and informal activities, whereas the other language is they-oriented and\nAITC04 104 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 105\nis considered appropriate to out-group and more formal relationships,particularly\nof an impersonal kind. The we\u2013they distinction is by no means absolute, so fine-\nshading is possible in switching; i.e., certain topics may be discussed in either\ncode, and the particular choice made itself helps to define the social situation or\nto shift that definition, as the case may be. Woolard (1989) provides a good\nexample of this kind of shift from Barcelona. Catalans use Catalan only to each\nother; they use Castilian to non-Catalans and they will even switch to Castilian\nif they become aware that the other person is speaking Catalan with a Castilian\naccent. Catalan is only for Catalans. It also never happens that one party speaks\nCatalan and the other Castilian even though such a conversation is theoretically\npossible since all Catalans are bilingual.\nA particular group of people may employ different kinds of code-switching\nfor different purposes. In their account of how the population of Hemnesberget,\na small Norwegian town of 1,300 inhabitants located close to the Arctic Circle,\nuse a local northern dialect of Norwegian, Ranam\u00e5l, and one of the standard\nvarieties, Bokm\u00e5l, Blom and Gumperz (1972) show how both situational and\nmetaphorical code-switching are used. Situational switching occurs when a teacher\ngives some kind of formal lecture in Bokm\u00e5l but the discussion that follows is\nin Ranam\u00e5l. Metaphorical switching is a more complicated phenomenon. One\ntype tends to occur when government officials and local citizens transact busi-\nness together. Although the variety generally used in such circumstances is Bokm\u00e5l,\nit is not unusual for both parties to use the occasional Ranam\u00e5l expression for\nspecial effect. Blom and Gumperz also discovered that, while most locals thought\nthey used Ranam\u00e5l exclusively in casual conversations and reserved Bokm\u00e5l for\nuse in school and church and on formal occasions, such was not the case. Tape\nrecordings revealed switches to Bokm\u00e5l to achieve certain effects. Moreover, the\nparticipants were not conscious of these switches, and even after such switching\nto Bokm\u00e5l was pointed out to them and they declared they would not do it\nagain, they continued to do so, as further tapings revealed.\nSuch persistence suggests that metaphorical code-switching in such situations\nis deeply ingrained and that it serves subtle but strong functions. Not only do\nnatives of Hemnesberget find the existence of two varieties of Norwegian useful\nto them in demonstrating we-ness (Ranam\u00e5l) and they-ness (Bokm\u00e5l), but they\nalso are able to employ both varieties together in such ways as to express fine\ngradations of feeling for others, involvement with the topic, politeness tostrangers,\nand deference to officials.\nGumperz (1982a, pp. 44\u201358) also reports on an interesting situation in the\nGail Valley of Austria near the borders of the former Yugoslavia and Italy,\nwhich shows how two languages (Slovenian and German) are used, what kinds\nof code-switching occur, and what changes appear to be in progress. Slovenian\nhas long been spoken in the valley, but the valley is part of Austria so German\nis the prestige language. The Slovenians of the village are bilingual. However,\nthe bilingual population tends to use Slovenian and German for quite different\npurposes. Gumperz explains (p. 47) that there are \u2018three speech varieties: aformal\nstyle of standard Austrian German, the regional German dialect, and the village\nvariety of Slovenian. To interact in accordance with the village communicative\nconventions, a speaker must control all three of these.\u2019 Children are encouraged\nAITC04 105 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 106 Codes\nto learn Standard German in school so as to maximize their opportunities for\nemployment. It is regarded \u2018as impolite or even crude to use Slovenian in the\npresence of German-speaking outsiders, be they foreigners or monolingual Ger-\nmans from the region.\u2019 Slovenian itself is reserved mainly for use in the family\nand informal local friendship circles. However, \u2018there is by no means a one-to-one\nrelationship between extralinguistic context and language use.\u2019\nGumperz\u2019s analysis of code-switching in the community reveals that the situ-\nation is quite complex because of the number of possibilities that are available,\nwith the \u2018right\u2019 choice highly dependent on the social context and intent of\nthe speaker. A further complication is that the need to maintain the in-group\n(Slovenian) versus out-group (German) difference has weakened considerably\nin recent years, mainly as a result of economic development brought about by\nincreased tourism in the area. The use of Slovenian is decreasing. The young use\nless and less Slovenian and code-switch much less than their elders, preferring\nto use German almost exclusively among themselves. While older bilinguals do\nnot speak German exactly like monolingual Germans, many young bilinguals\ndo. There is therefore a shift in progress in the functions of the two languages,\none which also affects code-switching since it involves the values attached to the\nlanguages and therefore a change in norms.\nCode-switching is not a uniform phenomenon; i.e., the norms vary fromgroup\nto group, even within what might be regarded as a single community. Gumperz\n(1982a, p. 68) has pointed out, for example, that:\nIn a relatively small Puerto Rican neighborhood in New Jersey, some members\nfreely used code-switching styles and extreme forms of borrowing both in everyday\ncasual talk and in more formal gatherings. Other local residents were careful to\nspeak only Spanish with a minimum of loans on formal occasions, reserving code-\nswitching styles for informal talk. Others again spoke mainly English, using Span-\nish or code-switching styles only with small children or with neighbors.\nHe adds that \u2018each communicating subgroup tends to establish its own con-\nventions with respect to both borrowing and code-switching,\u2019 and that factors\nsuch as region of origin, local residence, social class, and occupational niche are\ninvolved in defining the norms. Moreover, bilinguals in such communities are\naware not only of the norms that apply within their own sub-groups but also\nof some of the norms that other bilinguals observe (p. 69):\nResidents of such large Spanish\u2013English-speaking communities as San Francisco or\nNew York, which include immigrants from many Latin American regions, in fact\nclaim that they can tell much about a person\u2019s family background and politics from\nthe way that person code-switches and uses borrowings. What the outsider sees as\nalmost unpredictable variation becomes a communicative resource for members.\nSince bilingual usage rules must be learned by living in a group, ability to speak\nappropriately is a strong indication of shared background assumptions. Bilinguals,\nin fact, ordinarily do not use code-switching styles in their contact with other\nbilinguals before they know something about the listener\u2019s background and atti-\ntudes. To do otherwise would be to risk serious misunderstanding.\nAITC04 106 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 107\nThe following example from Chinua Achebe\u2019s novel No Longer at Ease (1975b,\npp. 66\u20137) shows how code-switching can be used within a situation involving\na creole to imply wrong-doing. Obi is a British-educated Nigerian and Josepha\nminister in the government. Clara is a friend of both.\nWhen Obi got back to Joseph\u2019s room it was nearly eleven o\u2019clock. Joseph was still\nup. In fact he had been waiting all the afternoon to complete the discussion they\nhad suspended last night.\n\u2018How is Clara?\u2019 he asked...\n\u2018She is fine,\u2019 he said. \u2018Your Nigerian police are very cheeky, you know.\u2019\n\u2018They are useless,\u2019 said Joseph, not wanting to discuss the police.\n\u2018I asked the driver to take us to the Victoria Beach Road. When we got there\nit was so cold that Clara refused to leave her seat. So we stayed at the back of the\ncar, talking.\u2019\n\u2018Where was the driver?\u2019 asked Joseph.\n\u2018He walked a little distance away to gaze at the lighthouse. Anyway, we were not\nthere ten minutes before a police car drew up beside us and one of them flashed\nhis torch. He said: \u201cGood evening, sir.\u201d I said: \u201cGood evening.\u201d Then he said: \u201cIs\nshe your wife?\u201d I remained very cool and said: \u201cNo.\u201d Then he said: \u201cWhere you\npick am?\u201d I couldn\u2019t stand that, so I blew up. Clara told me in Ibo to call the\ndriver and go away. The policeman immediately changed. He was Ibo, you see. He\nsaid he didn\u2019t know we were Ibos. He said many people these days were fond of\ntaking other men\u2019s wives to the beach. Just think of that. \u201cWhere you pick am?\u201d\u2019\n\u2018What did you do after that?\u2019\n\u2018We came away. We couldn\u2019t possibly stay after that.\u2019\nIn addition to the police officer\u2019s switch from the standard Is she your wife? to\nthe creole Where you pick am?, we have the reported shift to the use of Ibo,\nwhich has the immediate effect of changing the police officer\u2019s attitude because\nhe too speaks Ibo. Further on in the novel (p. 100), Achebe describes the speech\nof still another character in the following way:\nWhether Christopher spoke good or \u2018broken\u2019 English depended on what he was\nsaying, where he was saying it, to whom and how he wanted to say it. Of course\nthat was to some extent true of most educated people, especially on Saturdaynights.\nBut Christopher was rather outstanding in thus coming to terms with a double\nheritage.\n(The \u2018double heritage\u2019 referred to is the local combination of African and British\ninfluences.)\nOn p. 85, I pointed out a kind of code-switching that occurs among certain\nyoung people of Caribbean descent in England. These youngsters speak the local\nvariety of English natively but also have a creole-based variety of their own\nwhich they switch to for purposes of solidarity. What is interesting is that on\ncertain occasions they will allow youths of their acquaintance from other ethnic\ngroups to switch to that variety too, as they show their willingness to extend\nsome kind of solidarity to them. Rampton (1995) discusses some of the con-\nsequences of this \u2018crossing\u2019 behavior of members of these other groups, i.e.,\ntheir deliberate adoption of stigmatized linguistic forms.\nAITC04 107 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 108 Codes\nCode-switching itself may meet with certain kinds of resistance. Numerous\ninstances have been reported of speakers of various languages refusing to allow\nothers to code-switch and instead insisting on using the other\u2019s language, even\nif sometimes such use provided a poorer means of communication. In colo-\nnial times Europeans have been known to use a local language very badly with\nservants rather than let them use English, French, and so on, in order to main-\ntain social distance. In other circumstances knowledge of the second code must\nbe suppressed, i.e., code-switching is disallowed. Certain social situations may\nrequire that one code be used rather than another, even though that second\ncode is known to all participants but the first only to some. For example, a head\nof state may be required to use the official language of that state whenaddressing\nanother head of state, at least in public. On many public occasions in Canada\nit is obligatory for officials to say a few words in the official language that\nthey are not using, e.g., introduce some French sentences into an otherwise all-\nEnglish speech. The ability to code-switch may even be regarded with suspicion\nor disfavor in certain circumstances: speakers of English do not usually give\nmuch credit to their fellows who speak \u2018exotic\u2019 languages, such ability being\nregarded quite often as \u2018strange\u2019 in some way. As I have indicated, certainEnglish-\nspeaking societies find difficulty in coming to terms with immigrants who speak\nother languages, the resulting multilingualism often being viewed as creating a\n\u2018problem.\u2019\nThere can also be a switch of codes within a simple utterance without anyasso-\nciated topic change. Pfaff (1979) provides the following examples of this kindof\ncode-switching (sometimes called intra-sentential code-switching, or code-mixing)\namong Spanish\u2013English bilinguals:\nNo van a bring it up in the meeting.\n\u2018They are not going to bring it up in the meeting.\u2019\nTodos los Mexicanos were riled up.\n\u2018All the Mexicans were riled up.\u2019\nEstaba training para pelear.\n\u2018He was training to fight.\u2019\nSome dudes, la onda is to fight y jambar.\n\u2018Some dudes, the in thing is to fight and steal.\u2019\nAnother example, this time of a long utterance, spoken quite flowingly by a\nNew York Puerto Rican speaker, comes from Labov (1971, p. 457):\nPor eso cada, you know it\u2019s nothing to be proud of, porque yo no estoy proud of\nit, as a matter of fact I hate it, pero viene Vierne y Sabado yo estoy, tu me ve haci\na mi, sola with a, aqui solita, a veces que Frankie me deja, you know a stick or\nsomething, y yo equi solita, queces Judy no sabe y yo estoy haci, viendo television,\nbut I rather, y cuando estoy con gente yo me...borracha porque me siento mas,\nhappy, mas free, you know, pero si yo estoy com mucha gente yo no estoy, you\nknow, high, more or less, I couldn\u2019t get along with anybody.\nAITC04 108 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 109\nBilinguals often switch like this, primarily as a solidarity marker and this kind\nof mixture has become an established community norm in the Puerto Rican\ncommunity in New York City. However, a speaker who mixes codes in this way\nin conversation with a friend or acquaintance will almost certainly shift entirely\nto English when addressing a monolingual English-speaking person or entirely\nto Spanish when addressing a complete stranger who is obviously of Spanish\norigin.\nNishimura (1997) reports on the language choices of several Niseis (second-\ngeneration Japanese immigrants) living in Toronto as they conversed with a\nvariety of friends in private homes. These Niseis spoke Japanese to native Jap-\nanese, English to fellow Niseis, and a mixture of Japanese and English to mixed\ngroups of Japanese and Niseis. However, their Japanese contained some English\nwords \u2013 mainly when they did not know the Japanese equivalents \u2013 and their\nEnglish made \u2018sporadic use of Japanese phrases and sentences symboliz[ing] the\nspeaker\u2019s identity as a Nisei\u2019 (p. 156). However, all three types of use clearly\nshow a speaker\u2019s identity as a Nisei and his or her solidarity with other Niseis.\nWinford (2003, p. 41) says that the ability to code-mix Alsatian and French in\nStrasbourg symbolizes ethnic identity and solidarity. He contrasts Strasbourg\nwith Brussels where, especially among young people, the mixing of French and\nDutch is no longer seen as a marker of Brussels identity.\nMonolinguals are likely to be very critical of the new codes that result. They\nmay even use derogatory terms to describe what they hear, e.g., Franglais (French\nand English in Quebec), Fragnol (French and Spanish in Argentina), Spanglish\n(Cuban Spanish and English in the USA), and Tex-Mex (English and Mexican\nSpanish in Texas). Such dismissal of the phenomenon demonstrates serious\nmisunderstanding. What we have here is not just a haphazard mixing of two\nlanguages brought about by laziness or ignorance or some combination of these.\nWhat we have are conversants with a sophisticated knowledge of bothlanguages\nwho are also acutely aware of community norms. These norms require that both\nlanguages be used in this way so that conversants can show their familiarity or\nsolidarity. The ability to mix codes in this way is now often a source of pride,\ne.g., the ability to use pocho or cal\u00f3, the names that many Spanish-speaking\nNorth Americans give to these varieties.\nAs I indicated earlier, a fundamental difficulty in understanding thephenomenon\nof code-switching is accounting for a particular choice or switch on a particular\noccasion. In order to provide such an account we must look at the totallinguistic\nsituation in which the choice is made, e.g., the linguistic situation in New York\nCity, Brussels, Luxembourg, Kampala, Hemnesberget, or Papua New Guinea.\nThis task is no different, except perhaps quantitatively, from the task of trying\nto account for an individual\u2019s choice of one variety of a language in one set of\ncircumstances and of another in a different set. Such a task is not an easy one.\nSankoff (1972), for example, has quite clearly demonstrated how difficult it is\nto account for code choice in Papua New Guinea: prediction appears to be out\nof the question, but even accounting for choices after they have been made is\ndifficult.\nMyers-Scotton (1993b, and Scotton, 1983) has tried to account for code-\nswitching by proposing that speakers have unmarked and marked choices\nAITC04 109 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 110 Codes\navailable to them when they speak. These choices vary by situation. It is an\nunmarked choice for a citizen to address an inquiry to an official in Bokm\u00e5l in\nHemnesberget, for a teacher to speak Standard German to a visitor in a school\nin the Gail Valley, and for a police officer to speak English to someone in a good\ncar in Nigeria. Corresponding marked choices for initial encounters between\npeople who do not know each other in each of the above encounters would be\nRanam\u00e5l, Slovenian, and one of the indigenous Nigerian languages. However,\nthe unmarked choices are these latter languages when locals converse socially in\neach of these places. Quite often, in fact, local solidarity requires the use of a\nnon-prestige language or variety; it may even require a mixing of two languages.\nThese last observations are important: the unmarked\u2013marked distinction is quite\nindependent of any High\u2013Low, standard\u2013nonstandard, language\u2013dialect, or pure\u2013\nmixed distinctions. It is entirely dependent on situation. Myers-Scotton (1993a)\nhas further developed her views to try to account for some of the actual linguis-\ntic consequences of code-switching. Her Matrix Language Frame model says\nthat in code-switching one language acts as a dominant or matrix language and\nthe other as a subordinate or embedded language. She says that it is the basic\nword structure of the matrix language that determines what happens to words\nin the embedded language.\nMyers-Scotton has provided us with a good explanation for the variety ofcode-\nswitching behaviors we have observed. Speakers choose, not always consciously\nby any means, how they say what they want to say. They are generally aware\nof the power dimensions in the situations they find themselves in and they also\nknow who they want to be identified with, the solidarity dimension. They have\nsome idea too of how they want to appear to others and how they want others\nto behave toward them, both of these matters of \u2018face,\u2019 another concept we will\nhave occasion to use (see p. 276). When speakers have two or more codes avail-\nable to them, they increase their possible range of language behaviors. (The\nproblems they have in communicating therefore become easier or more difficult,\ndepending on how you view what communication is!) Code-switching can allow\na speaker to do many things: assert power; declare solidarity; maintain a certain\nneutrality when both codes are used; express identity; and so on.\nIn situations in which several languages or language varieties coexist, choices\nhave consequences. Bailey (2005) describes how Dominican Americanhigh-school\nstudents in Providence, Rhode Island negotiate their way among other students\nof different language backgrounds, mainly other Hispanics and AfricanAmericans.\nThey share a language with the former and color and social-class characteristics\nwith the latter. However, they seek to assert their own separate identity. Con-\nsequently, they have developed a code that \u2018includes distinctive alternation of\nforms indexing a Dominican American identity. Most salient of these, perhaps,\nis the alternation between English and Spanish in code-switching\u2019 (p. 259). They\nactually do use some speech characteristics of the African American students\nbut such use does not make them \u2018black\u2019 since their ability to use Spanish, their\nSpanish ethnolinguistic identity, triumphs over any common identity derived\nfrom African descent (p. 263). While they continue to speak their varieties of\nSpanish and English, they maintain at least for now their separate identity.\nHowever, Bailey adds (pp. 270\u20131), if succeeding generations of students fail\nAITC04 110 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 111\nto continue to do so, this could have serious consequences for maintaining a\nseparate Dominican American identity.\nIn this chapter we have seen numerous examples of the power and solidarity\ndimensions. Gardner-Chloros (1991) in a study of language use in Strasbourg\nshows among other things how switching between codes, in this case Standard\nFrench and Alsatian German, can be an effective neutral compromise for some\nlocals. They can employ code-switching when use of French alone might appear\nto be too snobbish and Alsatian alone to be too rustic. It is also often necessary\nwhen several generations of a family are present and allows for accommodation\nacross the generations. Another investigation (Gardner-Chloros, 1997) focused\non the use of the two languages in three department stores in Strasbourg:\nPrintemps, a branch of the famous chic Paris store, Magmod, old-fashioned and\nless luxurious, and Jung, quite provincial in comparison to either of the others.\nIn other words, there is a kind of prestige hierarchy with Printemps at the top,\nMagmod in the middle, and Jung at the bottom. One would assume that in\nPrintemps French would be the language most likely to be used by shoppers and\nshop assistants alike and that Jung would attract most use of Alsatian; Magmod\nwould be somewhere in the middle. Gardner-Chloros found that young French-\nspeaking shoppers in Jung and older Alsatian-speaking shoppers in Printemps\ncode-switched to the other language. There was least code-switching in Magmod.\nCode-switching goes in both directions: \u2018up\u2019 in Printemps and \u2018down\u2019 in Jung.\nAs Gardner-Chloros says (p. 374), it \u2018is clear...that the...assumption that\nswitching reveals a desire to converge to the prestige norm is inadequate. The\ngroup which switches more than any other appears to do so in order to fit in\nwith its surroundings, since it is made up of people who are more at ease in the\nprestige norm, French, than in Alsatian. Accommodation would therefore ap-\npear to be as relevant a motive as prestige.\u2019 We will look more closely below\nat this concept of \u2018accommodation\u2019 for its usefulness in explaining what appears\nto be happening here.\nIn a study of code-switching within Chinese\u2013English bilingual families in\nTyneside, England Li (1995) and Li and Milroy (1995) show how effective a\nswitch from the unmarked variety, in this case Chinese, to the marked variety,\nin this case English, can be when a mother asks her 12-year-old son in English\nrather than Chinese, why he has not finished his homework. English is the\npreferred language of the boy but Chinese that of his mother and the unmarked\nchoice in parent\u2013child talk. As Li and Milroy (p. 257) say, \u2018the mother knows\nthat by choosing the preferred language of the child instead of her ownpreferred\nlanguage, she is turning a simple question into an indirect request for the child\nto do his homework before playing with the computer.\u2019 Moreover, the child\ncorrectly interprets the question as a request.\nA further example comes from Fiji (Siegel, 1995) and it shows how the\nunmarked\u2013marked distinction can be used for humorous effect. Fiji is split\nalmost equally on racial lines with half the population speaking Fijian and the\nother half, of Indian descent, speaking Fijian Hindi, an immigrant language\nderived from contact among different varieties of Hindi and English. The two\ngroups use English in most contact situations and English is also the language\nof government, education, and business. Fijians often know some Fijian Hindi\nAITC04 111 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 112 Codes\nand sometimes use it among themselves in code-switching situations but only for\npurposes of joking. They introduce Fijian Hindi words into their utterances so\nas to direct some kind of mild humor at a fellow Fijian. As Siegel says (p. 101),\n\u2018In the Fiji situation, Hindi is not normally used for communication among\nFijians; so when a Fijian switches to Hindi among other Fijians, it is a marked\nchoice. For the listener(s), it is almost always a clear signal that the speaker is\njoking.\u2019\nCode choices can have still another important dimension. You can try to\nadopt a code used by others. Actors do this all the time, but how often do we\ntry to imagine ourselves in the shoes of some other or others, or, in some cases,\nactually try them on? The linguistic term for this kind of code choice is crossing\n(sometimes styling) (see Rampton, 1995, 2001). Sweetland (2002) describes\nhow a young white woman in the United States uses linguistic features generally\nassociated with African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in order to achieve\nmembership in a group of blacks, helped in this case by her growing up in an\noverwhelmingly black neighborhood. Bucholtz (1999) describes a similar case of\na white male student in a California high school where \u2018an ideologically defined\nblack\u2013white dichotomy...structures students\u2019 social worlds. Yet many Euro-\npean American students symbolically cross this divide through linguistic and\nother social practices that index their affiliation with African American youth\nculture, and especially hip hop\u2019 (p. 445). This student drew on features of AAVE\nto identify the group he wished to claim some kind of honorary membership in,\nparticularly through his use of a black-influenced speech style. (We should also\nremember that we are being asked to perform a variety of crossing when we are\nurged to abandon one language or dialect in favor of another. Crossing is\ndifficult at the best of times and often the results fall far short of the promises\nthat are made or the hopes that are raised.)\nAs we have seen, your choice of code also reflects how you want to appear\nto others, i.e., how you want to express your identity and\/or how you want\nothers to view you. This is apparent from various matched-guise experiments\nthat certain social psychologists have conducted. If person A is perfectlybilingual\nin languages X and Y, how is he or she judged as a person when speaking X?\nHow do the same judges evaluate A when A is speaking language Y? In matched-\nguise experiments the judges are unaware that they are judging A twice and that\nthe only variable is that A is using language X on one occasion and language\nY on the other, and using each for the same purpose. Their judgments, therefore,\nreally reflect their feelings about speakers of X and Y, feelings about such\nmatters as their competence, integrity, and attractiveness.\nLambert, a Canadian social psychologist, developed this technique in order to\nexplore how listeners react to various characteristics in speech. Listeners were\nasked to judge particular speech samples recorded by bilingual or bidialectal\nspeakers using one language or dialect (one guise) on one occasion and the other\nlanguage or dialect (the other guise) in identical circumstances. The judgments\nsought are of such qualities as intelligence, kindness, dependability, ambition,\nleadership, sincerity, and sense of humor. Since the only factor that is varied is\nthe language or dialect used, the responses provide group evaluations ofspeakers\nof these languages and dialects and therefore tap social stereotypes. In one such\nAITC04 112 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 113\nstudy Lambert (1967) reported the reactions of Canadian men and women, both\nEnglish and French speakers, to subjects who spoke English on one occasion\nand French on another. Both English and French listeners reacted morepositively\nto English guises than French guises. Among 80 English Canadian (EC) and 92\nFrench Canadian (FC) first-year college-age students from Montreal, he found\n(pp. 95\u20137) that:\nthe EC listeners viewed the female speakers more favorably in their French guises\nwhile they viewed the male speakers more favorably in their English guises. In\nparticular, the EC men saw the FC lady speakers as more intelligent, ambitious,\nself-confident, dependable, courageous and sincere than their English counterparts.\nThe EC ladies were not quite so gracious, although they, too, rated the FC ladies\nas more intelligent, ambitious, self-confident (but shorter) than the EC women\nguises. Thus, ECs generally view FC females as more competent and the EC men\nsee them as possessing more integrity and competence....FC men were not as\nfavorably received as the women were by their EC judges, EC ladies like EC men,\nrating them as taller, more likeable, affectionate, sincere, and conscientious, and as\npossessing more character and a greater sense of humor than the FC version of the\nsame speakers. Furthermore, the EC male judges also favored EC male speakers,\nrating them as taller, more kind, dependable and entertaining. Thus, FC male speak-\ners are viewed as lacking integrity and as being less socially attractive by both EC\nfemale, and, to a less marked extent, EC male judges.\n...The reactions to Continental French (CF) speakers are generally more favorable\nalthough less marked. The EC male listeners viewed CF women as slightly more\ncompetent and CF men as equivalent to their EC controls except for height and\nreligiousness. The EC female listeners upgraded CF women on sociability and self-\nconfidence, but downgraded CF men on height, likeability and sincerity. Thus, EC\njudges appear to be less concerned about European French people in general than\nthey are about the local French people; the European French are neither down-\ngraded nor taken as potential social models to any great extent....\n...the FC listeners showed more significant guise differences than didtheir EC\ncounterparts. FCs generally rated European French guises more favorably and\nCanadian French guises less favorably than they did their matched EC guises. One\nimportant exception was the FC women who viewed FC men as more competent\nand as more socially attractive than EC men.\nWhat is surprising in all of this is that the French Canadians had such a poor\nvaluation of themselves, apparently viewing their own linguistic and cultural\ngroup as somewhat inferior to both the English Canadian and the Continental\nFrench groups, with this preference apparently stronger in French Canadian\nmales than females. (This study is now nearly forty years old; it would be\nsurprising if a replication done today would show the same results, in view of\nthe many changes that have occurred in Quebec in recent decades.)\nOther investigators have used the matched-guise technique (see chapter 14)\nand report results which clearly indicate that listeners are affected by code\nchoices when they judge what speakers say to them. Certain codes are deemed\nmore appropriate for certain messages than other codes. Code and message are\ninseparable. Consequently, when a choice between codes exists (and such achoice\nnearly always does exist), you must exercise that choice with great care since it\ncan affect what happens to the message you wish to communicate. Giles and\nAITC04 113 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 114 Codes\nCoupland (1991, p. 58) conclude their summary of the work done up to 1990\non the matched-guise technique with the observation that, \u2018Listeners can very\nquickly stereotype others\u2019 personal and social attributes on the basis of language\ncues and in ways that appear to have crucial effects on important socialdecisions\nmade about them.\u2019\nOne important consequence from all that I have said above is that speakers\noften try to accommodate to the expectations that others have of them when\nthey speak. Accommodation is one way of explaining how individuals and\ngroups may be seen to relate to each other. One individual can try to induce\nanother to judge him or her more favorably by reducing differences between the\ntwo. An individual may need to sacrifice something to gain social approval of\nsome kind, for example, shift in behavior to be more like the other. This is\nconvergence behavior. Alternatively, if one desires to be judged less favorably the\nshift in behavior is away from the other\u2019s behavior. This is divergence behavior.\nThe particular behaviors involved may be of various kinds, not necessarily\nspeech alone: types of dress, choices of cultural pursuits, etc. There is alsoalways\na cost\u2013benefit aspect to any kind of accommodation. We see convergence when\na speaker tries to adopt the accent of a listener or that used within another\nsocial group or even in extreme cases gives up a particular accent, dialect, or\nlanguage completely. As a group phenomenon this last choice may \u2018kill\u2019 aminority\nlanguage. Divergence is behind exaggerating differences, e.g., recreolization\n(p. 85), Paraguayans using Guaran\u00ed rather than Spanish when abroad (p. 99),\nand many efforts in language planning (see chapter 15).\nGiles and Coupland (pp. 60\u20131) explain speech accommodation as \u2018a multiply-\norganized and contextually complex set of alternatives, regularly available to\ncommunicators in face-to-face talk. It can function to index and achieve solidar-\nity with or dissociation from a conversational partner, reciprocally and dynam-\nically.\u2019 Le Page (1997, p. 28) extends this definition to put even more emphasis\non the speaker\u2019s creation of his or her identity (Le Page\u2019s italics): \u2018we do not\nnecessarily adapt to the style of the interlocutor, but rather to the image we have\nof ourselves in relation to our interlocutor.\u2019 Speaking is not merely a social act\nthat involves others; it is also a personal act in that it helps create the identity\none wishes to be seen as having in a particular set of circumstances.\nOne type of convergent behavior is said to be motivated by how speakers\noften attempt to deal with listeners through audience design, i.e., by orienting\ntheir speech toward others through code choices (Bell, 1984, 2001). Bell goes\nso far as to declare that \u2018Speakers design their style primarily for and in response\nto their audience\u2019 (2001, p. 143: italics in the original) or occasionally by\nreference to a third party (referee design) as when the speech of an absent\nreference group influences language choices. He says that audience design ap-\nplies to all codes and all speakers, who have what he calls \u2018a fine-grained ability\u2019\n(p. 146) to do this. \u2018Individual speakers use style \u2013 and other aspects of their\nlanguage repertoire \u2013 to represent their identity or to lay claim to other ident-\nities\u2019 (p. 163). Style shifts constantly, but \u2018a person is more than an ever-shifting\nkaleidoscope of personas created in and by different situations, with no stable\ncore\u2019 (p. 164). We are what we are, but we do have the ability to present our-\nselves in different ways. We have control over what is sometimes called speaker\nAITC04 114 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 115\ndesign: the use of language \u2018as a resource in the actual creation, presentation,\nand re-creation of speaker identity\u2019 (Schilling-Estes, 2002, p. 388). Everything\nwe say to others recognizes those others; an individual\u2019s speech is not a series\nof monologs for it is shaped toward and tailored by what others say and do.\nJohnson-Weiner (1998) uses accommodation theory to explain differences in\nlanguage choice between some Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite\ncommunities in the northeastern United States (mainly New York and Pennsyl-\nvania) and Ontario and other New Order communities. The main difference\nis that the Old Order communities adhere strictly to use of different varieties\nof German \u2013 Low Pennsylvania German, High Pennsylvania German, and \u2018Bible\nGerman\u2019 \u2013 and English according to circumstances. They use the varieties of\nGerman exclusively within the communities and use English as a contact\nlanguage with the outside world. Within the New Order communities such as\nthe Beachy Amish and Horning Mennonites there has been a complete shift to\nEnglish. However, all groups follow strict rules \u2013 although not always the same\nones \u2013 about dress and use (or non-use) of automobiles, electricity, and tele-\nphones. Johnson-Weiner says that for the Old Order communities the mainten-\nance of German shows a desire for deliberate divergence from the outside world\nto the point of rejection. Its use of English accommodates to a necessity to keep\nthat world at bay; it is a way of dealing with that world so as to preserve each\ncommunity\u2019s isolation from it. For communities such as the Beachy Amish and\nHorning Mennonites the use of English paradoxically provides both inclusion\n(convergence) and exclusion (divergence) in that it enables both communication\nwith the outside world and a clear expression to that world of the values of each\ncommunity, particularly its strong religious beliefs.\nWe find another example of this accommodation process at work in Yau\u2019s\naccount (1997) of language use in the Hong Kong Legislative Council between\n1991 and 1995, i.e., in the years approaching the return of Hong Kong to China\n(1997). The council was a mixed group of establishment appointees and demo-\ncratically elected members. Its working languages were English and Cantonese\nwith the first having long historic use in the council and the second being the\nlanguage of Hong Kong, although almost completely ignored in the higher\nadministration of the colony. During the period of the investigation there\nwas a decrease in the amount of English used in the council and an increase in\nthe use of Cantonese and in the amount of code-switching to Cantonese. Yau\nhypothesizes that during these years the council became increasingly aware that\nthe total Hong Kong community was following its actions closely and that\ncouncilors and the government officials brought before the council increased\ntheir use of Cantonese as a consequence. They were accommodating to the\npower shift that was to take place in 1997. What little code-switching there was\nto English was found mainly in Cantonese-speaking councilors\u2019 dealings with\nthe anglophone president of the council, another type of accommodation. Evans\nand Green (2001, 2003) report that after 1997 writing and particularly reading\nin English continue to play an important role in the lives of Chinese profes-\nsionals with such use directly related to status. However, it is still too early to\npredict future directions since geopolitical and economic forces will largely\ndetermine what will happen.\nAITC04 115 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 116 Codes\nThe code we choose to use on a particular occasion indicates how we wish\nothers to view us. If we can comfortably control a number of codes, then we\nwould appear to have an advantage over those who lack such control. Speaking\nseveral of the languages can obviously be distinctly advantageous in amultilingual\ngathering. Finlayson et al. (1998) provide an interesting example. They showthat\nby code-switching in a conversation, a speaker can both access differentidentities\nand accommodate to others. Code-switching allows a speaker to meet someone\nelse half-way, establish common ground, and show flexibility and openness.Such\nqualities are extremely important in the particular social environment they dis-\ncuss, a black South African township home to various languages: \u2018people in the\ntownships are prepared to accommodate each other and believe that it isimport-\nant to do so because the issue of communication is at stake. Multilingualism is\nan accepted fact of life by the residents of Tembisa who speak differentlanguages\u2019\n(p. 403). Code-switching shows one to be a \u2018cooperative person, someone whocan\nrecognize that everyone does not have the same background\u2019 (p. 417). It reduces\npossibilities of conflict in situations which otherwise might be fraught withdanger.\nIn the last few pages I have been using code and style almost interchangeably\nsince style is one aspect of code: style is how you choose to code what you want\nto say on a particular occasion. It \u2018is the implementation, at any given time, of\na combination of features from many varieties...registers...and performance\ngenres...at [the] speaker\u2019s disposal...it is continuously modulated as it is\naccomplished, co-produced by audience, addressees, and refereees, sensitive to\ncharacteristics of these as well as to delicate contextual factors such as presence\nof an overhearer\u2019 (Mendoza-Denton, 2001, p. 235). Bernsten (1998) investig-\nated the shop talk of sixty-four employees in an automobile plant in Flint,\nMichigan. Workers and supervisors used language differently and each had\ncertain expectations of what language uses were appropriate and inappropriate.\nWorkers deemed supervisors who were too polite to be ineffective and some-\ntimes their use of questions such as \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to fix that?\u2019 to be ambigu-\nous. The styles of both workers and supervisors actually favored the use of bald\nimperatives without politeness markers as each group sought to assert or resist\npower within a basically adversarial relationship.\nMishoe (1998) investigated two styles of speaking in Cedar Falls in rural\nNorth Carolina using evidence from a single family. She calls one style \u2018home\nstyle,\u2019 used for in-group communication in the community, and the other style\nthe \u2018local standard,\u2019 the local approximation of Standard American English.\n\u2018What I need me is some time and some money, but I ain\u2019t got neither one right\nnow\u2019 is home style, and \u2018I don\u2019t go to saloons to eat \u2013 even if they have good\nfood, I don\u2019t want that kind of environment\u2019 is local standard. She found that\nthe local standard was used in very limited circumstances, e.g., for answering\nthe telephone, claiming some kind of expertise, exerting some other kind of\npower, or talking about sad things. Such uses were clearly marked and most\nconversations proceeded in home style. Mishoe concludes that the \u2018ultimate\nreason for style shifting is to promote ones [sic] self in the most positive light,\nand here we see ordinary people negotiating language in their home, showing\nthemselves to be linguistic virtuosos\u2019 (p. 177).\nAITC04 116 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Codes 117\nFinally, Barrett (1998) looked closely at how African American professional\ndrag queens performing in gay bars in Texas switch styles during their stage\nperformances. He defines style as the \u2018set of linguistic variables that are charac-\nteristic of a given dialect, register, or genre\u2019 (p. 142). The drag queens control\nthree styles: \u2018an AAVE style, a gay male style, and a style based on stereotypes\nof white women\u2019s speech\u2019 (p. 145). The styles are deliberate stereotypes. Abrupt\nstyle-shifting allows the performers to make observations about such issues as\nethnicity, sexuality, gender, or class, and also about a drag queen\u2019s own loyalties\nand identities \u2013 they are after all gay, black males not heterosexual, white\nfemales \u2013 and to \u2018undermine assumptions concerning the personal identity of the\nperformer\u2019 (p. 158).\nCode-switching can be a very useful social skill. The converse of this, of\ncourse, is that we will be judged by the code we choose to employ on a par-\nticular occasion. People have distinct feelings about various codes: they find\nsome accents \u2018unpleasant,\u2019 others \u2018beautiful\u2019; some registers \u2018stuffy\u2019; some styles\n\u2018pedantic\u2019; some languages or kinds of language \u2018unacceptable\u2019 or their speakers\n\u2018less desirable\u2019; and so on. We cannot discount such reactions by simply labeling\nthem as instances of linguistic prejudice. Linguistic prejudice, either for or against\nparticular accents, dialects, or languages, is a fact of life, a fact we must recog-\nnize. However, we must also remember that it is often all too easy to think that\nsomeone who uses learned words, beautifully constructed sentences, and a pres-\ntige accent must be saying something worthwhile and that someone who uses\ncommon words, much \u2018slurring,\u2019 and a regional accent cannot haveanything of\ninterest to say!\nDiscussion\n1. Using the example of what he calls a \u2018hypothetical government functionary\u2019\nin Belgium, Fishman (1972a) explains how topic and domain influence\nlinguistic choice. The domain may be social, cultural, or psychological in\nnature and will involve a consideration of such matters as role relationships\nand locales. Fishman offers the following account of the linguistic behavior\nof his functionary (p. 16):\nA government functionary in Brussels arrives home after stopping off at his\nclub for a drink. He generally speaks standard French in his office, standard\nDutch at his club, and a distinctly local variant of Flemish at home. In each\ninstance he identifies himself with a different speech network to which he\nbelongs, wants to belong, and from which he seeks acceptance. All of these\nnetworks \u2013 and more \u2013 are included in his overarching speech community,\neven though each is more commonly associated with one variety than with\nanother. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to find occasions at the office in which\nhe speaks or is spoken to in one or another variety of Flemish. There are also\noccasions at the club when he speaks or is addressed in French; finally, there\nare occasions at home when he communicates in standard Dutch or even\nFrench.\nAITC04 117 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 118 Codes\nShow how Fishman\u2019s explanation is relevant to this account. Are you aware\nof any similar kinds of linguistic behavior in your own environment?\n2. When you visit a foreign country whose language you know either well or\npoorly, when do you use that language and when do you not? What factors\ngovern your choice?\n3. The claim is sometimes made (e.g., Gumperz, 1982a, p. 61) that in conver-\nsational code-switching \u2018participants immersed in the interaction itself are\noften quite unaware which code is used at any one time.\u2019 How would you\npropose to investigate such a claim? Gumperz says that this is also the case\nwith metaphorical code-switching (p. 62). He writes as follows (p. 70):\nCode-switching occurs in conditions of change, where group boundaries are\ndiffuse, norms and standards of evaluation vary, and where speakers\u2019 ethnic\nidentities and social backgrounds are not matters of common agreement. Yet,\nif it is true that code-switching styles serve as functioning communicative\nsystems, if members can agree on interpretations of switching in context and\non categorizing others on the basis of their switching, there must be some\nregularities and shared perceptions on which these judgments can be based.\nElaborate on the various factors Gumperz mentions in the first of these two\nsentences. Discuss the implications of the second sentence for any theory\nwhich attempts to explain linguistic and\/or communicative competence in\nhumans.\n4. Code-switching and borrowing are different phenomena. Try to distinguish\nbetween the two.\nFurther Reading\nThe \u2018classic\u2019 essay on diglossia is Ferguson (1959); Hudson (1992) is a good\nbibliography. Fishman (1972a, 1972b) and Gumperz (1971, 1982a, 1982b) are\nolder sources. Heller (1988), Myers-Scotton (1993a, 1993b, 1998), Milroy and\nMuysken (1995), Auer (1998), and Eckert and Rickford (2001) are good sources\nfor code-switching and stylistic choices. Scotton (1986) discusses both diglossia\nand code-switching. Much of Lambert\u2019s work has employed the matched-guise\ntechnique to examine aspects of bilingualism, and the paper cited (Lambert,\n1967) provides a good introduction. See Giles and Powesland (1975) and Giles\nand Coupland (1991) for accommodation.\nAITC04 118 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Speech Communities 119\n5 Speech Communities\nLanguage is both an individual possession and a social possession. We would\nexpect, therefore, that certain individuals would behave linguistically like other\nindividuals: they might be said to speak the same language or the same dialect\nor the same variety, i.e., to employ the same code, and in that respect to be\nmembers of the same speech community, a term probably derived from the\nGerman Sprachgemeinschaft. Indeed, much work in sociolinguistics is based on\nthe assumption that it is possible to use the concept of \u2018speech community\u2019\nwithout much difficulty. Hudson (1996, p. 29) rejects that view: \u2018our sociolin-\nguistic world is not organized in terms of objective \u201cspeech communities,\u201d even\nthough we like to think subjectively in terms of communities or social types such\nas \u201cLondoner\u201d and \u201cAmerican.\u201d This means that the search for a \u201ctrue\u201ddefinition\nof the speech community, or for the \u201ctrue\u201d boundaries around some speech\ncommunity, is just a wild goose chase.\u2019 We will indeed discover that just as it\nis difficult to define such terms as language, dialect, and variety, it is also\ndifficult to define speech community, and for many of the same reasons. That\ndifficulty, however, will not prevent us from using the term: the concept has\nproved to be invaluable in sociolinguistic work in spite of a certain \u2018fuzziness\u2019\nas to its precise characteristics. It remains so even if we decide that a speech\ncommunity is no more than some kind of social group whose speech character-\nistics are of interest and can be described in a coherent manner.\nDefinitions\nSociolinguistics is the study of language use within or among groups ofspeakers.\nWhat are groups? \u2018Group\u2019 is a difficult concept to define but one we must\ntry to grasp. For our purposes, a group must have at least two members but\nthere is really no upper limit to group membership. People can group together\nfor one or more reasons: social, religious, political, cultural, familial, vocational,\navocational, etc. The group may be temporary or quasi-permanent and the\npurposes of its members may change, i.e., its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. A group is also more\nthan its members for they may come and go. They may also belong to other\ngroups and may or may not meet face-to-face. The organization of the group\nAITC05 119 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 120 Speech Communities\nmay be tight or loose and the importance of group membership is likely to vary\namong individuals within the group, being extemely important to some and of\nlittle consequence to others. An individual\u2019s feelings of identity are closely re-\nlated to that person\u2019s feelings about groups in which he or she is a member, feels\nstrong (or weak) commitment (or rejection), and finds some kind of success (or\nfailure).\nWe must also be aware that the groups we refer to in various research studies\nare groups we have created for the purposes of our research using this or that\nset of factors. They are useful and necessary constructs but we would be unwise\nto forget that each such group comprises a set of unique individuals each with\na complex identity (or, better still, identities). Consequently, we must be careful\nin drawing conclusions about individuals on the basis of observations we make\nabout groups. To say of a member of such a group that he or she will always\nexhibit a certain characteristic behavior is to offer a stereotype. Individuals can\nsurprise us in many ways.\nThe kind of group that sociolinguists have generally attempted to study iscalled\nthe speech community. (See Patrick, 2002, for a general survey.) For purely\ntheoretical purposes, some linguists have hypothesized the existence of an \u2018ideal\u2019\nspeech community. This is actually what Chomsky (1965, pp. 3\u20134) proposes,\nhis \u2018completely homogeneous speech community\u2019 (see p. 3). However, such a\nspeech community cannot be our concern: it is a theoretical construct employed\nfor a narrow purpose. Our speech communities, whatever they are, exist in a\n\u2018real\u2019 world. Consequently, we must try to find some alternative view of speech\ncommunity, one helpful to investigations of language in society rather than\nnecessitated by abstract linguistic theorizing.\nLyons (1970, p. 326) offers a definition of what he calls a \u2018real\u2019 speech com-\nmunity: \u2018all the people who use a given language (or dialect).\u2019 However, that\nreally shifts the issue to making the definition of a language (or of a dialect) also\nthe definition of a speech community. If, as we saw in chapter 2, it proves virtu-\nally impossible to define language and dialect clearly and unambiguously, then\nwe have achieved nothing. It is really quite easy to demonstrate that a speech\ncommunity is not coterminous with a language: while the English language is\nspoken in many places throughout the world, we must certainly recognize thatit\nis also spoken in a wide variety of ways, in speech communities that are almost\nentirely isolated from one another, e.g., in South Africa, in New Zealand, and\namong expatriates in China. Alternatively, a recognizably single speechcommunity\ncan employ more than one language: Switzerland, Canada, Papua New Guinea,\nmany African states, and New York City.\nFurthermore, if speech communities are defined solely by their linguistic char-\nacteristics, we must acknowledge the inherent circularity of any such definition\nin that language itself is a communal possession. We must also acknowledgethat\nusing linguistic characteristics alone to determine what is or is not a speech com-\nmunity has proved so far to be quite impossible because people do notnecessarily\nfeel any such direct relationship between linguistic characteristics A, B, C, and\nso on, and speech community X. What we can be sure of is that speakers douse\nlinguistic characteristics to achieve group identity with, and groupdifferentiation\nfrom, other speakers, but they use other characteristics as well: social, cultural,\nAITC05 120 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Speech Communities 121\npolitical and ethnic, to name a few. Referring to what they call speech markers,\nGiles, Scherer, and Taylor (1979, p. 351) say:\nthrough speech markers functionally important social categorizations are discrim-\ninated, and...these have important implications for social organization. For\nhumans, speech markers have clear parallels...it is evident that social categories\nof age, sex, ethnicity, social class, and situation can be clearly marked on the basis\nof speech, and that such categorization is fundamental to social organization even\nthough many of the categories are also easily discriminated on other bases.\nOur search must be for criteria other than, or at least in addition to, linguistic\ncriteria if we are to gain a useful understanding of \u2018speech community.\u2019\nFor very specific sociolinguistic purposes we might want to try to draw quite\nnarrow and extremely precise bounds around what we consider to be a speech\ncommunity. We might require that only a single language be spoken (andemploy\na very restrictive definition of language in doing so), and that the speakers in\nthe community share some kind of common feeling about linguistic behavior in\nthe community, that is, observe certain linguistic norms. This appeal to norms\nforms an essential part of Labov\u2019s definition of speech community (1972b,\npp. 120\u20131):\nThe speech community is not defined by any marked agreement in the use of\nlanguage elements, so much as by participation in a set of shared norms; these\nnorms may be observed in overt types of evaluative behavior, and by the uniform-\nity of abstract patterns of variation which are invariant in respect to particular\nlevels of usage.\nThis definition shifts the emphasis away from an exclusive use of linguistic\ncriteria to a search for the various characteristics which make individuals feel\nthat they are members of the same community. Milroy (1987a, p. 13) hasindicated\nsome consequences of such a view:\nThus, all New York speakers from the highest to lowest status are said to consti-\ntute a single speech community because, for example, they agree in viewing pres-\nence of post vocalic [r] as prestigious. They also agree on the social value of a large\nnumber of other linguistic elements. Southern British English speakers cannot be\nsaid to belong to the same speech community as New Yorkers, since they do not\nattach the same social meanings to, for example, (r): on the contrary, the highest\nprestige accent in Southern England (RP) is non-rhotic. Yet, the Southern British\nspeech community may be said to be united by a common evaluation of the vari-\nable (h); h-dropping is stigmatized in Southern England...but is irrelevant in New\nYork City or, for that matter, in Glasgow or Belfast.\nIn this sense, \u2018speech community\u2019 is a very abstract concept, one likely to create\nnot a few problems, because the particular norms that a community uses mayor\nmay not be exclusively linguistic in nature, and even the linguistic norms them-\nselves may vary considerably among small sub-groups. For example, speakers of\nHindi will separate themselves entirely from speakers of Urdu; most Ukrainians\nAITC05 121 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 122 Speech Communities\nwill separate themselves from most Russians (but possibly not vice versa); and\nmost Chinese will see themselves as members of the same community as all\nother Chinese, even though speakers of Cantonese or Hokkien might not be able\nto express that sense of community to a speaker of Mandarin or to each other\nexcept through their shared writing system.\nThe single-language, or single-variety, criterion is also a very dubious one.\nGumperz (1971, p. 101) points out that \u2018there are no a priori grounds which\nforce us to define speech communities so that all members speak the same\nlanguage.\u2019 As I observed in the previous chapter, many societies have existed and\nstill exist in which bilingualism and multilingualism are normal. For example,\nearly in the year 2000 London was judged to be the most \u2018international\u2019 of all\ncities in the world based on the number of different languages spoken there \u2013\nover 300. It is such considerations as these which lead Gumperz (p. 101) to use\nthe term linguistic community rather than speech community. He proceeds to\ndefine that term as follows:\na social group which may be either monolingual or multilingual, held together by\nfrequency of social interaction patterns and set off from the surrounding areas by\nweaknesses in the lines of communication. Linguistic communities may consist of\nsmall groups bound together by face-to-face contact or may cover large regions,\ndepending on the level of abstraction we wish to achieve.\nIn this definition, then, communities are defined partially through their rela-\ntionships with other communities. Internally, a community must have a certain\nsocial cohesiveness; externally, its members must find themselves cut off from\nother communities in certain ways. The factors that bring about cohesion and\ndifferentiation will vary considerably from occasion to occasion. Individuals will\ntherefore shift their sense of community as different factors come into play. Such\na definition is an extension of the one that Bloomfield (1933, p. 42) uses to open\nhis chapter on speech communities: \u2018a speech community is a group of people\nwho interact by means of speech.\u2019 The extension is provided by the insistence\nthat a group or community is defined not only by what it is but by what it is\nnot: the \u2018cut-off\u2019 criterion.\nGumperz (1971, p. 114) offers another definition of the speech community:\nany human aggregate characterized by regular and frequent interaction by means\nof a shared body of verbal signs and set off from similar aggregates by significant\ndifferences in language usage.\nMost groups of any permanence, be they small bands bounded by face-to-face\ncontact, modern nations divisible into smaller subregions, or even occupational\nassociations or neighborhood gangs, may be treated as speech communities, pro-\nvided they show linguistic peculiarities that warrant special study.\nNot only must members of the speech community share a set of grammatical\nrules, but there must also be regular relationships between language use andsocial\nstructure; i.e., there must be norms which may vary by sub-group and social\nsetting. Gumperz adds (p. 115):\nAITC05 122 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Speech Communities 123\nWherever the relationships between language choice and rules of social appropri-\nateness can be formalized, they allow us to group relevant linguistic forms into\ndistinct dialects, styles, and occupational or other special parlances. The sociolin-\nguistic study of speech communities deals with the linguistic similarities and dif-\nferences among these speech varieties.\nFurthermore, \u2018the speech varieties employed within a speech community form a\nsystem because they are related to a shared set of social norms\u2019 (p. 116). Such\nnorms, however, may overlap what we must regard as clear languageboundaries.\nFor example, in Eastern Europe many speakers of Czech, Austrian German, and\nHungarian share rules about the proper forms of greetings, suitable topics for\nconversation, and how to pursue these, but no common language. They areunited\nin a Sprachbund, \u2018speech area,\u2019 not quite a \u2018speech community,\u2019 but still a\ncommunity defined in some way by speech. As we can see, then, trying to define\nthe concept of \u2018speech community\u2019 requires us to come to grips with definitions\nof other concepts, principally \u2018group,\u2019 \u2018language\u2019 (or \u2018variety\u2019), and \u2018norm.\u2019\nHymes (1974, p. 47) disagrees with both Chomsky\u2019s and Bloomfield\u2019s defini-\ntions of a speech community. He claims that these simply reduce the notion of\nspeech community to that of a language and, in effect, throw out \u2018speech com-\nmunity\u2019 as a worthwhile concept. He points out that it is impossible to equate\nlanguage and speech community when we lack a clear understanding of the\nnature of language. He insists that speech communities cannot be defined solely\nthrough the use of linguistic criteria (p. 123). The way in which people view the\nlanguage they speak is also important, that is, how they evaluate accents; how\nthey establish the fact that they speak one language rather than another; and\nhow they maintain language boundaries. Moreover, rules for using a language\nmay be just as important as feelings about the language itself. He cites the\nexample of the Ngoni of Africa. Most Ngoni no longer speak their ancestral\nlanguage but use the language of the people they conquered in Malawi. How-\never, they use that language in ways they have carried over from Ngoni, ways\nthey maintain because they consider them to be essential to their continued\nidentity as a separate people. Hymes adds that analogous situations may be\nobserved among some native groups in North America: they use English in\nspecial ways to maintain their separate identities within the dominant English-\nspeaking community. As we saw too in the previous chapter code-switching\ncan be used to achieve a shared identity and delimit a group of speakers from\nall others.\nFor Hymes, the concept of \u2018speech community\u2019 is a difficult one to grasp in\nits entirety, for it depends on how one defines \u2018groups\u2019 in society. He also dis-\ntinguishes (pp. 50\u20131) between participating in a speech community and being a\nfully fledged member of that community:\nTo participate in a speech community is not quite the same as to be a member of\nit. Here we encounter the limitation of any conception of speech community in\nterms of knowledge alone, even knowledge of patterns of speaking as well as of\ngrammar, and of course, of any definition in terms of interaction alone. Just the\nmatter of accent may erect a barrier between participation and membership in one\ncase, although be ignored in another. Obviously membership in a community depends\nAITC05 123 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 124 Speech Communities\nupon criteria which in the given case may not even saliently involve language and\nspeaking, as when birthright is considered indelible.\nHowever, he reaffirms (p. 51) an earlier (1962, pp. 30\u20132) definition of speech\ncommunity: \u2018a local unit, characterized for its members by common locality and\nprimary interaction.\u2019 He is prepared to \u2018admit exceptions cautiously.\u2019\nBrown and Levinson (1979, pp. 298\u20139) point out that:\nSocial scientists use the word \u2018group\u2019 in so many ways, as for example in the\nphrases small group, reference group, corporate group, ethnic group, interest group,\nthat we are unlikely to find any common core that means more than \u2018set\u2019. Social\nscientists who adopt the weak concept of structure ...are likely to think of groups\nin relatively concrete terms, as independently isolable units of social structure....On\nthe other hand, social theorists who adopt the stronger concept of structure are\nmore likely to think of groups as relative concepts, each group being a unit that\nis relevant only in relation to units of like size that for immediate purposes are\ncontrasted with it. Thus for a man who lives in Cambridge, his territorial identi-\nfication will be with Cambridge when contrasted with Newmarket, with Cam-\nbridgeshire when contrasted with Lancashire, with England when contrasted with\nScotland, with the United Kingdom when contrasted with Germany, and so on.\n\u2018Group\u2019 is therefore a relative concept and \u2018speech community\u2019 must also be\nrelative. You are a member of one speech community by virtue of the fact that\non a particular occasion you identify with X rather than Y when apparently X\nand Y contrast in a single dimension. This approach would suggest that there\nis an English speech community (because there are French and German ones),\na Texas speech community (because there are London and Bostonian ones), a\nHarvard speech community (because there are Oxford and Berkeley ones), a\nChicano speech community (because there are Spanish and English ones), and\nso on. An individual therefore belongs to various speech communities at the\nsame time, but on any particular occasion will identify with only one of them,\nthe particular identification depending on what is especially important or con-\ntrastive in the circumstances. For any specific speech community, the concept\n\u2018reflects what people do and know when they interact with one another. It\nassumes that when people come together through discursive practices, they behave\nas though they operate within a shared set of norms, local knowledge, beliefs,\nand values. It means that they are aware of these things and capable of knowing\nwhen they are being adhered to and when the values of the community are being\nignored...it is fundamental in understanding identity and representation of\nideology\u2019 (Morgan, 2001, p. 31).\nDiscussion\n1. Try to label yourself according to what kind(s) of English you speak.Explain\nwhy you choose the specific terms you use and any connotations these\nterms have for you, e.g., Bristol English, Texas English, educated Tyneside\nEnglish.\nAITC05 124 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Speech Communities 125\n2. To show that very small changes in linguistic behavior can serve to disaffiliate\nyou from other members of the same speech community, make deliberate\nadjustments in your speech on some occasion: that is, become more formal\nor less formal than seems to be required by the occasion; introduce technical\nor learned vocabulary when it is not called for; employ slang or coarse\nexpressions; shift your accent (perhaps even to mimic another person); or\nswitch to a distinct regional dialect. (Be careful!) What happens? How do\nsuch shifts affect your relationship to your listeners and any feelings you or\nthey have about a common identity?\n3. In what respects do (or did) the following pairs of people belong to the\nsame speech communities or to different ones: Presidents J. F. Kennedy and\nLyndon Johnson; Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher; the Pope and the\nArchbishop of Canterbury; Professor Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle;\nElizabeth II and John Lennon; Geoffrey Chaucer and George Bernard Shaw.\n4. Describe the linguistic uses of some bilinguals with whom you are familiar.\nWhen do they use each of the languages? If you are bilingual yourself, in what\nways do you identify with people who show the same range of linguistic\nabilities? A different range?\n5. In what respects does the language which is characteristic of each of the\nfollowing groups, if there is such a characteristic language, mark each group\noff as a separate speech community: adolescents; stockbrokers; women;\nlinguists; air traffic controllers; priests; disk jockeys? How useful is the\nconcept of \u2018speech community\u2019 in cases such as these?\n6. Le Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985) and Trudgill (1986, pp. 85\u20136) distin-\nguish between focused and diffuse languages and communities, the main\ndifference being the degree to which people agree about the shared features\nof the language or community. In this view the English public schools would\nbe highly focused but Kingston, Jamaica, would be quite diffuse. Try to\napply this distinction to other situations of which you are aware.\nIntersecting Communities\nThe fact that people do use expressions such as New York speech, London\nspeech, and South African speech indicates that they have some idea of how a\n\u2018typical\u2019 person from each place speaks, that is, of what it is like to be a member\nof a particular speech community somewhat loosely defined. Such a person may\nbe said to be typical by virtue of observing the linguistic norms one associates\nwith the particular place in question. But just what are these norms? I have\nalready noted (p. 49) the work of Preston (1989, 1999, 2002), which shows that\na person\u2019s perceptions of the language characteristics of particular areas do not\nalways accord with linguistic facts. Rosen (1980, pp. 56\u20137) has also indicated\nsome of the problems you find in trying to call a city like London a speech\ncommunity and in describing exactly what characterizes its speech. He says that\nsuch cities \u2018cannot be thought of as linguistic patchwork maps, ghetto after\nAITC05 125 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 126 Speech Communities\nghetto, not only because languages and dialects have no simple geographical\ndistribution but also because interaction between them blurs whatever bound-\naries might be drawn. Both a geographical model and a social class modelwould\nbe false, though each could contribute to an understanding.\u2019 In such places,\n\u2018dialects and languages are beginning to influence each other. Urbanization is a\ngreat eroder of linguistic frontiers.\u2019 The result is:\nthe creation of thousands of bilingual and to a certain extent bidialectal speakers\non a scale and of a diversity unprecedented in our history. Which dialect of English\nthey learn depends in the main on their social class position in this country. It is\ncommon practice to talk of the \u2018target language\u2019 of a second-language learner. In\nLondon it will be a moving target, though undoubtedly most by virtue of their\nsocial position will have as their chief model London working-class speech.\nLondon is a community in some senses but not in others; however, with its 300\nlanguages or more it is in no sense a single speech community (see Baker and\nEversley, 2000). It is just too big and fragmented. On the other hand, if we say\nit must be a composite of small speech communities, we may not be any better\noff. Are these smaller communities geographical, social, ethnic, religious, or\noccupational in orientation? That is, how do any linguistic factors we might\nisolate relate to such social factors? Are the communities static or fluid? If they\nare static, how do they maintain themselves, and if they are fluid, whatinferences\nmust we draw concerning any concept we might have of \u2018speech community\u2019?\nAre their boundaries strong and clear or are they weak and permeable?Moreover,\nLondon is no different from most large cities anywhere in the world, a world\nwhich is increasingly a world of large cities, heterogeneously populated.\nWe can easily see how difficult it is to relate the concept of \u2018speechcommunity\u2019\ndirectly to language or languages spoken and even to groups and norms if we\nrefer back to the linguistic situation among the Tukano described in the previous\nchapter (p. 97). In that situation, which requires one to take as a marriage\npartner someone who speaks an entirely different language and furthermore\nrequires the female to join the male\u2019s household, multilingualism is endemic and\nnormal. However, each residential community has its unique multilingual mix\nand no language equates in distribution to a specific residential community. Such\na situation is not unique. Many other parts of the world would have some of\nthe same multilingual characteristics; e.g., the Balkans, large areas of the Indian\nsubcontinent, and Papua New Guinea. The actual equation of language to com-\nmunity is perhaps most easily seen in certain modern states which have insisted\nthat language be used to express some concept of \u2018nationhood\u2019 and, in doing\nso, have tried to standardize and promote a particular language (or particular\nlanguages) at the expense of competitors. But such solutions are not always\nlasting or uncontroversial, as we can see in countries such as Germany, France,\nthe United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, all of which have recently\nhad to acknowledge in one way or another the presence of people who do not\nspeak the standard variety (or varieties) but who are, nevertheless, very much\npart of the larger communities.\nPerhaps the concept of \u2018speech community\u2019 is less useful than it might be\nand we should return to the concept of \u2018group\u2019 as any set of individuals united\nAITC05 126 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Speech Communities 127\nfor a common end, that end being quite distinct from ends pursued by other\ngroups. Consequently, a person may belong at any one time to many different\ngroups depending on the particular ends in view.\nWe can illustrate this approach as follows. At home, a person may live in a\nbilingual setting and switch easily back and forth between two languages. She\n\u2013 let this be a female person \u2013 may shop in one of the languages but work inthe\nother. Her accent in one of the languages may indicate that she can be classified\nas an immigrant to the society in which she lives, an immigrant, moreover, from\na specific country. Her accent in the other language shows her to be a native of\nregion Y in country Z. Outside country Z, however, as she now is, she regards\nherself (and others from Z agree with her) as speaking not a Y variety of Z\nbut as speaking Z itself. She may also have had extensive technical training in\nher new country and in her second language and be quite unable to use her first\nlanguage in work related to this specialty. In the course of the day, she will\nswitch her identification from one group to another, possibly even, as we saw\nin the preceding chapter, in the course of a single utterance. She belongs to\none group at one moment and to a different one at another. But to how many\naltogether?\nThe concept must be flexible because individuals find it advantageous to shift\ntheir identities quite freely. As Bolinger (1975, p. 333) says,\nThere is no limit to the ways in which human beings league themselves togetherfor\nself-identification, security, gain, amusement, worship, or any of the other purposes\nthat are held in common; consequently there is no limit to the number and variety\nof speech communities that are to be found in a society.\nSaville-Troike (1996, p. 357) places even more importance on the need for\nindividuals to identify themselves with various others but her views are essen-\ntially the same as those of Bolinger: \u2018Individuals may belong to several speech\ncommunities (which may be discrete or overlapping), just as they mayparticipate\nin a variety of social settings. Which one or ones individuals orient themselves\nto at any given moment \u2013 which set of social and communicative rules they use\n\u2013 is part of the strategy of communication. To understand this phenomenon, one\nmust recognize that each member of a community has a repertoire of social\nidentities and that each identity in a given context is associated with a number\nof appropriate verbal and nonverbal forms of expression.\u2019\nA very interesting variant of this notion is the idea that speakers participate\nin various communities of practice. Eckert and McConnell-Ginet (1998, p. 490)\ndefine a community of practice as \u2018an aggregate of people who come together\naround mutual engagements in some common endeavor. Ways of doing things,\nways of talking, beliefs, values, power relations \u2013 in short, practices \u2013 emerge\nin the course of their joint activity around that endeavor.\u2019 A community of\npractice is at the same time its members and what its members are doing to\nmake them a community: a group of workers in a factory, an extended family,an\nadolescent gang, a women\u2019s fitness group, a classroom, etc. They add (p. 490):\n\u2018Rather than seeing the individual as some disconnected entity floating around\nin social space, or as a location in a network, or as a member of a particular\nAITC05 127 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 128 Speech Communities\ngroup or set of groups, or as a bundle of social characteristics, we need to focus\non communities of practice.\u2019 (See Meyerhoff, 2002, particularly pp. 527\u201330, for\nadditional details.) It is such communities of practice that shape individuals,\nprovide them with their identities, and often circumscribe what they can do.\nEckert used this concept in her research (see p. 212).\nIf there is no limit to the ways in which individuals can classify themselves\nand speakers must constantly create and recreate social identities for themselves,\nthen it may be almost impossible to predict which group or community an\nindividual will consider himself (or herself) to belong to at a particular moment.\nThe group chosen to identify with will change according to situation: at one\nmoment religion may be important; at another, regional origin; and at stillanother,\nperhaps membership in a particular profession or social class. An individual\nmay also attempt to bond with others because all possess a set of characteristics,\nor even just a single characteristic, e.g., be of the same gender, or even because\nall lack a certain characteristic, e.g., not be of white skin color. The bonding can\ntherefore be positive, as when the individuals share some feature or features,\nor negative, as when the individuals lack some feature or features. Language\nbonding appears to be no different. In one case command of a particular dialect\nor language may provide a bond and therefore a sense of community orsolidarity\nwith others; in another case the lack of such command may exclude you from\na community of speakers, e.g., of RP users or speakers of Yoruba if all you\nspeak is Brooklynese. But even sharing the same dialect might be of no signific-\nance: if the circumstances require you to discuss astrophysics and you lack the\nlanguage of astrophysics, you will not be able to enter the community of\nastrophysicists. Speakers of Yoruba may also find themselves with speakers of\nJapanese and Arabic within an English-speaking foreign-student speech com-\nmunity at a North American or European university.\nEach individual therefore is a member of many different groups. It is in the\nbest interests of most people to be able to identify themselves on one occasion\nas members of one group and on another as members of another group. Such\ngroups may or may not overlap. One of the consequences of the intersecting\nidentifications is, of course, linguistic variation: people do not speak alike, nor\ndoes any individual always speak in the same way on every occasion. The\nvariation we see in language must partly reflect a need that people have to be\nseen as the same as certain other people on some occasions and as different from\nthem on other occasions.\nDiscussion\n1. Try to determine in what respects the following countries are both single\nspeech communities and complexes of intersecting speech communities: the\nUnited States, Singapore, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Australia, Switzer-\nland, Haiti, and India.\n2. Explain the idea that a community or group must be defined partly inrelation\nto some other community or group and to circumstances. Show how this\nhelps to explain what is likely to happen in such situations as the following:\nAITC05 128 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Speech Communities 129\na. In a \u2018jam\u2019 in Turkey, you find someone who also speaks English. That\nsomeone is (i) a Turk who speaks it badly; (ii) a Turk who speaks it\nwell; (iii) someone from another part of the English-speaking world\nwho speaks Turkish well.\nb. While sightseeing by yourself in Nepal, you, from Dubuque, Iowa, meet\nsomeone from (i) Glasgow, (ii) Boston, (iii) Iowa, (iv) Dubuque.\nc.

You overhear someone discussing you quite unfavorably in an \u2018exotic\u2019\nlanguage which you, by reason of foreign birth, happen to speak like\na native.\nNetworks and Repertoires\nAnother way of viewing how an individual relates to other individuals in society\nis to ask what networks he or she participates in. That is, how and on what\noccasions does a specific individual A interact now with B, then with C, and\nthen again with D? How intensive are the various relationships: does A interact\nmore frequently with B than with C or D? How extensive is A\u2019s relationship\nwith B in the sense of how many other individuals interact with both A and B\nin whatever activity brings them together? If, in a situation in which A, B, C,D,\nand E are linked in a network, as in figure 5.1, are they all equally linked asin\n(1) in that illustration; strongly linked but with the link through A predominant,\nas in (2); weakly linked, with the link to A providing all the connections, as in\n(3); or, as in (4), is the link from A to E achieved through C?\nYou are said to be involved in a dense network if the people you know and\ninteract with also know and interact with one another. If they do not the net-\nwork is a loose one. You are also said to be involved in a multiplex networkif\nthe people within it are tied together in more than one way, i.e., not just through\nwork but also through other social activities. People who go to school together,\nmarry each other\u2019s siblings, and work and play together participate in dense\nmultiplex networks. In England these are said to be found at the extremes of the\nsocial-class structure. Such networks indicate strong social cohesion, produce\nfeelings of solidarity, and encourage individuals to identify with others within\nthe network. On the other hand, middle-class networks are likely to be looseand\nsimplex; therefore, social cohesion is reduced and there are weaker feelings of\nsolidarity and identity.\nDubois and Horvath (1999, p. 307) acknowledge that while the concept of\nsocial networks seems to be useful in studying language behavior in urban\nsettings, its effectiveness in nonurban settings, in their case among English\u2013\nFrench bilingual Cajuns in rural Louisiana, is not so clear. They say: \u2018The notion\nof network is strongly conditioned by the effects of scale and place. Being a\nmember of an open or closed network is quite different if you live in New\nAITC05 129 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 130 Speech Communities\nA A\nE B E B\n(1) D C (2) D C\nA A\nE B D B\nC\nD C\n(3) (4) E\nFigure 5.1 Simple network relationships\nOrleans..., Lafayette..., Eunice..., or Iota....We do not wish to imply\nthat the notion of network loses its methodological importance in nonurban\nsettings, but only that the linguistic effect of closed and open networks is intim-\nately related to the type of community under study.\u2019\nMuch linguistic behavior seems explicable in terms of network structure and\nwe will see in chapters 7 and 8 how valuable the concept of \u2018social network\u2019 is\nwhen we consider matters of language variation and change (see Milroy, 2002,\nfor additional details). Milroy and Gordon (2003, p. 119) also point out thatthe\n\u2018concepts of network and community of practice are...closely related, and the\ndifferences between them are chiefly method and focus. Network analysis typic-\nally deals with structural and content properties of the ties that constitute\negocentric personal networks...[but] cannot address the issues of how and\nwhere linguistic variants are employed...to construct local social meanings.\nRather, it is concerned with how informal social groups...support local norms\nor...facilitate linguistic change.\u2019\nIt is quite apparent that no two individuals are exactly alike in their linguistic\ncapabilities, just as no two social situations are exactly alike. People are separ-\nated from one another by fine gradations of social class, regional origin, and\noccupation; by factors such as religion, gender, nationality, and ethnicity; by\npsychological differences such as particular kinds of linguistic skills, e.g., verbality\nAITC05 130 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM Speech Communities 131\nor literacy; and by personality characteristics. These are but some of the more\nobvious differences that affect individual variation in speech.\nAn individual also has a speech repertoire; that is, he or she controls a\nnumber of varieties of a language or of two or more languages. Quite often,\nmany individuals will have virtually identical repertoires. In this case it may be\npossible to argue, as Platt and Platt (1975, p. 35) do, that \u2018A speech repertoire\nis the range of linguistic varieties which the speaker has at his disposal and\nwhich he may appropriately use as a member of his speech community.\u2019\nThe concept of \u2018speech repertoire\u2019 may be most useful when applied to indi-\nviduals rather than to groups. We can use it to describe the communicative\ncompetence of individual speakers. Each person will then have a distinctive\nspeech repertoire. Since the Platts find both a community\u2019s speech repertoire and\nan individual\u2019s speech repertoire worthy of sociolinguistic consideration, they\nactually propose the following distinction (p. 36):\nWe...suggest the term speech repertoire for the repertoire of linguistic varieties\nutilized by a speech community which its speakers, as members of the community,\nmay appropriately use, and the term verbal repertoire for the linguistic varieties\nwhich are at a particular speaker\u2019s disposal.\nIn this view each individual has his or her own distinctive verbal repertoire and\neach speech community in which that person participates has its distinctive\nspeech repertoire; in fact, one could argue that this repertoire is its defining\nfeature.\nFocusing on the repertoires of individuals and specifically on the precise lin-\nguistic choices they make in well-defined circumstances does seem to offer us\nsome hope of explaining how people use linguistic choices to bond themselves\nto others in very subtle ways. A speaker\u2019s choice of a particular sound, word,\nor expression marks that speaker in some way. It can say \u2018I am like you\u2019 or \u2018I\nam not like you.\u2019 When the speaker also has some kind of range within which\nto choose, and that choice itself helps to define the occasion, then many different\noutcomes are possible. A particular choice may say \u2018I am an X just like you\u2019 or\nit may say \u2018I am an X but you are a Y.\u2019 It may even be possible that a particular\nchoice may say \u2018Up till now I have been an X but from now on you must regard\nme as a Y,\u2019 as when, for example, someone pretends to be something he or she\nis not and then slips up. However, it also seems that it is not merely a simple\nmatter of always choosing X rather than Y \u2013 for example, of never saying\nsingin\u2019 but always saying singing. Rather, it may be a matter of proportion: you\nwill say singin\u2019 a certain percent of the time and singing the rest of the time. In\nother words, the social bonding that results from the linguistic choices you make\nmay depend on the quantity of certain linguistic characteristics as well as their\nquality.\nWe have seen that \u2018speech community\u2019 may be an impossibly difficult concept\nto define. But in attempting to do so, we have also become aware that it may\nbe just as difficult to characterize the speech of a single individual. Perhaps that\nsecond failure follows inevitably from the first. We should be very cautious\ntherefore about definitive statements we may be tempted to make about how a\nAITC05 131 5\/9\/05, 4:35 PM 132 Speech Communities\nparticular individual speaks, the classic concept of \u2018idiolect.\u2019 Just what kinds of\ndata should you collect? How much? In what circumstances? And what kind of\nclaims can you make? We will need to find answers to questions such as these\nbefore we can proceed very far. Any attempt to study how even a singleindividual\nspeaks in a rather limited set of circumstances is likely to convince us rather\nquickly that language is rather \u2018messy\u2019 stuff. For certain theoretical reasons it\nmight be desirable to ignore a lot of that mess, as Chomsky insists that we do;\nbut it would be unwise for sociolinguists always to do so since that is, in one\nsense, what sociolinguistics is all about: trying to work out either the social\nsignificance of various uses of language or the linguistic significance of various\nsocial factors. The following three chapters will address some of these issues.\nDiscussion\n1. Try to construct a network of your linguistic relationships in an attempt to\nrepresent the different varieties of language you use and the relative propor-\ntions of use among those varieties. What are some of the difficulties you\nencounter in doing so? (The latter will probably have to do with taking into\naccount external factors such as place, occasion, participants, and so on. A\nmulti-dimensional network may seem necessary, something next to impos-\nsible to represent on a two-dimensional surface.)\n2.

One wayof\ncharacterizing certain variations is to say that speakers of a particular language\nsometimes speak different dialects of that language. Although I have already\nnoted how difficult it is to define dialect, we may still find it useful to use the\nterm in our work in sociolinguistics, and even to extend its use from studies of\nregional variation to those of social variation. In this way it would be possible\nto talk about both regional dialects and social dialects of a language. Just as a\nregional dialect marks off the residents of one region from those of other re-\ngions, a social dialect would be a variety associated with a specific social class\nor group, marking that class or group off from other classes or groups. How-\never, if this further differentiation of varieties is to be successful, it will require\nus to be able to find linguistic features which are associated with differences in\nclasses or groups and, of course, to define what we mean by these latter terms.\nSociolinguists today are generally more concerned with social variation in\nlanguage than with regional variation. However, if we are to gain a sound\nunderstanding of the various procedures used in studies of social variation, we\nshould look at least briefly at previous work in regional dialectology. That work\npoints the way to understanding how recent investigations have proceeded as\nthey have. Studies of social variation in language grew out of studies of regional\nvariation. It was largely in order to widen the limits and repair the flaws that\nwere perceived to exist in the latter that investigators turned their attention to\nsocial-class variation in language. As we will see, there may still be certain\nlimitations in investigating such variation but they are of a different kind. It is\nalso important to note that even if there are limitations to this kind of work,\nmany sociolinguists regard it as being essentially what sociolinguistics is \u2013 or\nshould be \u2013 all about (see pp. 14\u201315). In this view the study of language\nvariation tells us important things about languages and how they change. This\nchapter and the two that follow deal with such matters.\nAITC06 135 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 136 Language Variation\nRegional Variation\nThe mapping of dialects on a regional basis has had a long history in linguistics\n(see Petyt, 1980, Chambers and Trudgill, 1998, and Wakelin, 1977). In fact, it\nis a well-established part of the study of how languages change over time, i.e.,\nof diachronic or historical linguistics. Traditionally, dialect geography, as this\narea of linguistic study is known, has employed assumptions and methods drawn\nfrom historical linguistics, and many of its results have been used to confirm\nfindings drawn from other historical sources, e.g., archeological findings, popu-\nlation studies, written records. In this view languages differentiate internally as\nspeakers distance themselves from one another over time and space; the changes\nresult in the creation of dialects of the languages. Over sufficient time, the result-\ning dialects become new languages as speakers of the resulting varieties become\nunintelligible to one another. So Latin became French in France, Spanish in\nSpain, Italian in Italy, and so on.\nIn this model of language change and dialect differentiation, it should always\nbe possible to relate any variation found within a language to the two factors\nof time and distance alone; e.g., the British and American varieties, or dialects,\nof English are separated by over two centuries of political independence and by\nthe Atlantic Ocean; Northumbrian and Cockney English are nearly 300 miles\nand many centuries apart. In each case, linguists working in this tradition tryto\nexplain any differences they find with models familiar to the historical linguist,\nmodels which incorporate such concepts as the \u2018family tree\u2019 (Latin has \u2018branched\u2019\ninto French, Spanish, and Italian), phonemic \u2018split\u2019 (English \/f\/ and \/v\/ are now\ndistinctive phonemes whereas once they were phonetic variants, or allophones,\nof a single phoneme) or phonemic \u2018coalescence\u2019 (English ea and ee spellings, as\nin beat and beet, once designated different pronunciations), the \u2018comparative\nmethod\u2019 of reconstruction (English knave and German Knabe come from the\nsame source), and \u2018internal reconstruction\u2019 (though mouse and mice now have\ndifferent vowel sounds, this was not always the case).\nDialect geographers have traditionally attempted to reproduce their findings\non maps in what they call dialect atlases. They try to show the geographical\nboundaries of the distribution of a particular linguistic feature by drawing a line\non a map. Such a line is called an isogloss: on one side of the line people say\nsomething one way, e.g., pronounce bath with the first vowel of father, and on\nthe other side they use some other pronunciation, e.g., the vowel of cat. Quite\noften, when the boundaries for different linguistic features are mapped in this\nway the isoglosses show a considerable amount of criss-crossing. On occasion,\nthough, a number coincide; i.e., there is a bundle of isoglosses. Such a bundle\nis often said to mark a dialect boundary. One such bundle crosses the south\nof France from east to west approximately at the 45th parallel (Grenoble to\nBordeaux) with words like chandelle, chanter, and chaud beginning with a sh\nsound to the north and a k sound to the south. Quite often, that dialect bound-\nary coincides with some geographical or political factor, e.g., a mountain ridge,a\nriver, or the boundary of an old principality or diocese. Isoglosses can also show\nthat a particular set of linguistic features appears to be spreading from one\nAITC06 136 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 137\nDanish\n[ik]\nFrisian\n[makvn]\n[dorp]\nAmsterdam\n[dat []\nm a\nkv n]\nBerlin\nSlavic\nD\u00fcsseldorf\nm a\nxv n]\nk] [\n[i\n[makvn]\n[ix] [d [o dr op r] f] Cologne\n[maxvn]\nTrier\n[dat]\nas]\n[ [i mx a]\nxvn] Slavic\n[d ver\n[dorf ]\nRi\n[das] Magyar\nRomance ne\nhi\nR\nBasle\nSlavic\nRomance\nFigure 6.1 The Rhenish Fan\nlocation, a focal area, into neighboring locations. In the 1930s and 1940s\nBoston and Charleston were the two focal areas for the temporary spread of\nr-lessness in the eastern United States. Alternatively, a particular area, a relicarea,\nmay show characteristics of being unaffected by changes spreading out from one\nor more neighboring areas. Places like London and Boston are obviously focal\nareas; places like Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2013 it remained r-pronouncing in the 1930s\nand 1940s even as Boston dropped the pronunciation \u2013 in New England and\nDevon in the extreme southwest of England are relic areas. Wolfram (2004) calls\nthe dialect of such an area a remnant dialect and, in doing so, reminds us that\nnot everything in such a dialect is a relic of the past for such areas also have\ntheir own innovations. Huntley, a rural enclave in Aberdeenshire, Scotland,\nwhere Marshall worked (2003, 2004) is also a relic area (see p. 211).\nThe Rhenish Fan is one of the best-known sets of isoglosses in Europe, setting\noff Low German to the north from High German to the south. The setcomprises\nthe modern reflexes (i.e., results) of the pre-Germanic stop consonants *p, *t,\nand *k. These have remained stops [p,t,k] in Low German but have become the\nfricatives [f,s,x] in High German (i.e., Modern Standard German), giving variant\nforms for \u2018make\u2019 [makvn], [maxvn]; \u2018that\u2019 [dat], [das]; \u2018village\u2019 [dorp], [dorf];\nand \u2018I\u2019 [ik], [ix]. Across most of Germany these isoglosses run virtually together\nfrom just north of Berlin in an east\u2013west direction until they reach the Rhine.\nAt that point they \u2018fan\u2019, as in figure 6.1. Each area within the fan has a different\nAITC06 137 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 138 Language Variation\n\u00d8\/\u00e4\nr\/\u00e4\n\u00d8\/\u00ce\nr\/\u00ce\nFigure 6.2 Intersecting isoglosses\nincidence of stops and fricatives in these words, e.g., D\u00fcsseldorf has [ix], [makvn],\n[dorp], and [dat], and Trier has [ix], [maxvn], [dorf], and [dat]. The boundaries\nwithin the fan coincide with old ecclesiastical and political boundaries. The\nchange of stops to fricatives, called the Second German Consonant Shift,appears\nto have spread along the Rhine from the south of Germany to the north.Political\nand ecclesiastical frontiers along the Rhine were important in that spread as\nwere centers like Cologne and Trier. The area covered by the fan itself is some-\ntimes called a transition area (in this case, between Low and High German)\nthrough which a change is progressing in contrast to either a focal or relic area.\nVery often the isoglosses for individual phonological features do not coincide\nwith one another to give us clearly demarcated dialect areas. For example, in\nEngland the isogloss that separates stood or come pronounced with [\u00e4] rather\nthan [\u00ce] runs roughly east and west (with [\u00e4] to the north). It intersects the\nisogloss that separates farm pronounced with or without the [r], which runs\nroughly northwest to southeast (with [r] to the west, except for pockets of [r]\npronunciation in the West Midlands and Northeast). This gives us the four\ndistinct areas illustrated in figure 6.2: [r] and [\u00e4]; [r] and [\u00ce]; \u00d8, i.e., nothing and\n[\u00e4]; and \u00d8 and [\u00ce]. These two quite different distributions, i.e., the \u2018criss-cross\u2019\npattern, are just about impossible to explain using traditional \u2018family-tree\u2019 type\nmodels of linguistic change. We should also note that the [\u00e4] and [r] pronun-\nciations are \u2018retreating\u2019 before those with [\u00ce] and \u00d8, which are more and more\nassociated with the standard variety of the language. Isoglosses do cross and\nbundles of them are rare. It is consequently extremely difficult to determine\nboundaries between dialects in this way and dialectologists acknowledge this\nfact. Hudson (1996, p. 39) draws a somewhat negative conclusion: \u2018isoglosses\nneed not delimit varieties, except in the trivial sense where varieties each consist\nAITC06 138 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 139\nof just one item; and if we cannot rely on isoglosses to delimit varieties, what\ncan we use?\u2019 However, if we look at Trudgill\u2019s book (1999) on English dialects\nwe can see the many positive results of this kind of work.\nDialect-atlas type approaches such as Trudgill\u2019s take a particular linguistic\nfeature, which we will soon call a linguistic variable (see following section), and\nshow its distribution geographically. They also attempt to relate thatdistribution\nto the historical development of the language, both internally, i.e., linguistically,\nand externally, i.e., politically, socially, and culturally.\nBecause dialect studies grew out of historical studies of languages, it should\nalso come as no surprise that they have focused almost exclusively on rural\nareas. Rural areas were regarded as \u2018conservative\u2019 in the sense that they were\nseen to preserve \u2018older\u2019 forms of the languages under investigation. Urban areas\nwere acknowledged to be innovative, unstable linguistically, and difficult to\napproach through existing survey techniques. When the occasional approach\nwas made, it was biased toward finding the most conservative variety of urban\nspeech. Ignoring towns and cities may be defensible in an agrarian-based soci-\nety; however, it is hardly defensible in the heavily urbanizing societies of today\u2019s\nworld as the only way to study the language variation that exists there. An\nalternative approach is called for.\nOne basic assumption in dialect geography is that regional dialects are really\nquite easy to sample: just find one or two people in the particular location you\nwish to investigate, people who are preferably elderly and untraveled, interview\nthem, and ask them how they pronounce particular words, refer to particular\nobjects, and phrase particular kinds of utterances. A sampling of such people\nfrom various locations throughout a wide geographical area will allow the dia-\nlect geographer to show where particular sounds, forms, and expressions are\nused, and where boundaries can be drawn around these so that area A may be\ndescribed as an area in which linguistic feature X occurs (or is used) whereas\narea B has no instances of that feature. If there are sufficient differences between\nthe linguistic features employed in areas A and B, then we may say that we\nactually have two dialects, A and B, of the particular language in question.\nWhile this kind of study of regional varieties of languages has a long and\nrespected history, it also has serious limitations. As I have said, it tends to ignore\ndensely populated areas, specifically large sprawling urban areas, because of the\ncomplexities of both sampling and data evaluation. The selection of informants\nalso tends not to be very well controlled, often reflecting no more than the judg-\nment of the person collecting the data that a particular individual is \u2018representat-\nive\u2019 of the area being sampled. It certainly lacks the kind of scientific rigor that\nsociologists have come to insist on in sampling any population. For example, the\ninformants chosen for the Linguistic Atlas of the United States and Canada were\nof three types (Kurath, 1939, p. 44), chosen as follows:\nType I: Little formal education, little reading, and restricted socialcontacts\nType II: Better formal education (usually high school) and\/or widerreading\nand social contacts\nType III: Superior education (usually college), cultured background, wide\nreading, and\/or extensive social contacts\nAITC06 139 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 140 Language Variation\nEach of these three types was then sub-categorized as follows:\nType A: Aged, and\/or regarded by the field worker as old-fashioned\nType B: Middle-aged or younger, and\/or regarded by the field worker as\nmore modern\nWe should also note that it was the field worker for the Atlas who decided\nexactly where each informant fitted in the above scheme of things. A certain\ncircularity is obviously involved: the Atlas studies were intended partly to find\nout how speech related to social class, but speech was itself used as one of the\ncriteria for assigning membership in a social class. The field worker alone judged\nwhether a particular informant should be used in the study, and Type IA inform-\nants were particularly prized as being most representative of local speech.\nIn England, the Survey of English Dialects carried out between 1950 and\n1961 with informants from 313 localities in England and Wales employed sim-\nilar criteria (Orton et al., 1978, p. 3):\nThe selection of informants was made with especial care. The fieldworkers were\ninstructed to seek out elderly men and women \u2013 more often men, since women\nseemed in general to encourage the social upgrading of the speech of their families\n\u2013 who were themselves of the place and both of whose parents were preferably\nnatives also. They were to be over 60 years of age, with good mouths, teeth and\nhearing and of the class of agricultural workers who would be familiar with the\nsubject matter of the questionnaire and capable of responding perceptively and\nauthoritatively.\nOnce again we see strong emphasis given to traditional speech forms as we\nmight expect in dialect studies which are a direct offshoot of historical, com-\nparative work in linguistics.\nDialect-atlas studies attempted to relate variation in language to settlement\nhistory and tended to ignore social-class factors. There was some recognition\nof the latter, but it was relatively small owing to the inadequate systems of social\nclassification that were employed in most investigations. However, it is still\npossible to make some observations. For example, in the southern and south\nMidlands dialects of the United States, a form such as you-all is found in use\namong all social classes, whereas I might could and a apple are found in use\nonly among speakers in the low and middle classes, and I seed and fistes, postes,\nand costes (as plurals of fist, post, and cost) are found in use only among\nspeakers from the low class.\nSince most of us realize that it is not only where you come from that affectsyour\nspeech but also your social and cultural background, age, gender, race,occupation,\nand group loyalty, the traditional bias toward geographic origin alone now\nappears to be a serious weakness. Then, too, the overriding model of language\nchange and differentiation is an extremely static one, and one that is reinforced,\nrather than questioned, by the types of data selected for analysis. Speakers from\ndifferent regions certainly interact with one another; dialect breaks orboundaries\nare not \u2018clean\u2019; and change can be said to be \u2018regular\u2019 only if you are prepared\nto overlook certain kinds of irregularities as exceptions, relics, borrowings, \u2018minor\u2019\nvariations, and so on. Furthermore, the varieties of a language spoken withinlarge\nAITC06 140 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 141\ngatherings of people in towns and cities must influence what happens to other\nvarieties of that language: to attempt to discuss the history of English, French,\nor Italian while ignoring the influences of London, Paris, or Florence would\nseem to be something like attempting to produce Hamlet without the prince!\nAll of this is not to say that this kind of individual and social variation has\ngone unnoticed in linguistics. Linguists have long been aware of variation in the\nuse of language: individuals do speak one way on one occasion and other ways\non other occasions, and this kind of variation can be seen to occur within even\nthe most localized groups. Such variation is often ascribed to dialect mixture,\ni.e., the existence in one locality of two or more dialects which allow a speaker\nor speakers to draw now on one dialect and then on the other. An alternative\nexplanation is free variation, i.e., random \u2018meaningless\u2019 variation of no signific-\nance. However, no one has ever devised a suitable theory to explain either\ndialect mixture or free variation, and the latter turns out not to be so free after\nall because close analyses generally reveal that complex linguistic and social\nfactors appear to explain much of the variation.\nThere have been some recent developments in this kind of work which hold\npromise for future discoveries. They result largely from our growing ability to\nprocess and analyze large quantities of linguistic data. One, for example, is\nKretzschmar\u2019s work on the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic\nStates (LAMSAS). He shows (1996) how it is possible to use quantitativemethods\nto demonstrate the probability of occurrence of specific words or sounds in\nspecific areas. This kind of mapping clearly illustrates that when we call some-\nthing dialect A and something else dialect B we are dealing with somewhatvague\nconcepts, for the realities are quite fuzzy; any concepts we may have about an\n\u2018ideal speaker\u2019 or a \u2018dialect boundary\u2019 reside at least as much in our heads as\nthey do in the data. In another approach to dialects, this one focusing on howa\nspecific dialect emerged, Lane (2000) used a variety of economic, demographic,\nand social data from 3,797 residents of Thybor\u00f8n, Denmark, covering the years\n1890\u20131996, to reveal how the local dialect \u2018is the result of a constant situation\nthat led to the formation of a new dialect as a result of massive in-migration...a\nnew system created largely out of materials selected from competing systems in\ncontact and from innovations that indexed the new local linguistic community\u2019\n(p. 287). It was clearly another triumph for an aspiration to achieve a local\nidentity. We can see a similar emphasis on using traditional dialect materials to\nhelp us account for current language varieties in recent writings on new Englishes\n(see Gordon et al., 2004, Hickey, 2004, and Trudgill, 2004).\nI have deliberately not focused at length on dialect geography since it is not\none of our major concerns and I have already (in chapter 2) considered certain\nissues related to dialects. Dialect geography does raise a number of issues,however,\nwhich are important to our concerns. One is the kind of variation that weshould\ntry to account for in language. Another has to do with sampling the population\namong which we believe variation to exist. Still another is the collection,analysis,\nand treatment of the data that we consider relevant. And, finally, there are the\noverriding issues of what implications there are in our findings for theoretical\nmatters concerning the nature of language, variation in language, the language-\nlearning and language-using abilities of human beings, and the processesinvolved\nAITC06 141 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 142 Language Variation\nin linguistic change. It is to these issues that I will now turn, and in doing so,\nfocus on social rather than regional variation in language. The major conceptual\ntool for investigation of such variation will be the \u2018linguistic variable.\u2019\nDiscussion\n1. If you are unfamiliar with such concepts as the \u2018family tree,\u2019 \u2018phonemicsplit,\u2019\nthe \u2018comparative method of reconstruction,\u2019 and \u2018internal reconstruction,\u2019you\nshould consult a good introductory text on linguistics or historicallinguistics.\nThe traditional concept of \u2018dialect\u2019 depends heavily on an understanding of\nthese concepts from historical linguistics. Try to demonstrate that this is so.\n2. Look at how informants were selected for the work that went into thedialect\natlases of Germany, France, England, and New England. For example, note\nthat they were nearly always older men. Discuss the merits of this kind of\nsampling. Look also at the kinds of questions that the informants wereasked,\nand how they were asked them. Do the atlases have any value beyond being\nsome kind of historical record, and a partly \u2018idealized\u2019 one at that?\n3. In a discussion of the maps used in dialect atlases Le Page (1997, p. 18) says\nthat the \u2018dialect areas outlined by the isoglosses on the maps were arti-\nfacts of the geographer; they had to be matched against such stereotypes as\n\u201csouthern dialect\u201d or \u201cAlemmanic\u201d or \u201clangue d\u2019oc,\u201d concepts which often\nrelated in the minds of outsiders to just one or two variables characterizing\na complete, discrete system.\u2019 How do you relate specific pronunciations,\nword choices, and usages to certain regions? Are these characteristic of\nall residents of the regions? Is there, therefore, such a being as a \u2018typical\nCockney,\u2019 a \u2018typical Australian,\u2019 and a \u2018typical Texan\u2019 so far as language is\nconcerned? (See Preston, 1989.)\n4. You might try to find out what you can about how such matters as free\nvariation and dialect mixture are treated in a variety of introductory textsin\nlinguistics. How might a sociolinguist view the same range of phenomena?\n5. Try to list the formative influences on the variety of English you speak andto\ngive relative weights to those influences. You might consider such factors as\nwhen and where you learned English, your social and cultural background,\nthe range of occasions on which you use English, and any other relevant\nmatters. A comparison of your set of factors and the weights you assign\nthese with the sets and weights that others propose should prove interesting.\nThe Linguistic Variable\nThe investigation of social dialects has required the development of an array of\ntechniques quite different from those used in dialect geography. Many of these\nderive from the pioneering work of Labov, who, along with other sociolinguists,\nhas attempted to describe how language varies in any community and to draw\nAITC06 142 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 143\nconclusions from that variation not only for linguistic theory but also sometimes\nfor the conduct of everyday life, e.g., suggestions as to how educators should\nview linguistic variation (see chapter 14). As we will see, investigators now pay\nserious attention to such matters as stating hypotheses, sampling, the statistical\ntreatment of data, drawing conclusions, and relating these conclusions to such\nmatters as the inherent nature of language, the processes of language acquisition\nand language change, and the social functions of variation.\nPossibly the greatest contribution has been in the development of the use of\nthe \u2018linguistic variable,\u2019 the basic conceptual tool necessary to do this kind of\nwork (see Wolfram, 1991). As I have just indicated, variation has long been\nof interest to linguists, but the use of the linguistic variable has added a new\ndimension to linguistic investigations. Although not all linguists find the concept\nuseful in their work, it has nevertheless compelled most of its severest critics to\nreconsider just what it is they are theorizing about when they talk of \u2018language,\u2019\nof a speaker\u2019s \u2018knowledge\u2019 of language, and of the relationship between such\nknowledge and actual \u2018use.\u2019\nA linguistic variable is a linguistic item which has identifiable variants. For\nexample, words like singing and fishing are sometimes pronounced as singin\u2019\nand fishin\u2019. The final sound in these words may be called the linguistic variable\n(ng) with its two variants [\u00ba] in singing and [n] in singin\u2019. Another example of\na linguistic variable can be seen in words like farm and far. These words are\nsometimes given r-less pronunciations; in this case we have the linguistic vari-\nable (r) with two variants [r] and \u00d8 (pronounced \u2018zero\u2019). Still another example\ninvolves the vowel in a word like bend. That vowel is sometimes nasalized and\nsometimes it is not; sometimes too the amounts of nasalization are noticeably\ndifferent. In this case we have the linguistic variable (e) and a number of vari-\nants, [y], [*]1,..., [*]n; here the superscripts 1 to n are used to indicate the degree\nof nasalization observed to occur. We might, for example, find two or even three\ndistinct quantities of nasalization.\nThere are at least two basically different kinds of variation. One is of the kind\n(ng) with its variants [\u00ba] or [n], or (th) with its variants [\u03b8], [t], or [f], as in with\npronounced as with, wit, or wif. In this first case the concern is with which quite\nclearly distinct variant is used, with, of course, the possibility of \u00d8, the zero\nvariant. The other kind of variation is the kind you find above in (e): [*]1,...,\n[*]n, when it is the quantity of nasalization, rather than its presence or absence,\nwhich is important. How can you best quantify nasalization when the phenom-\nenon is actually a continuous one? The same issue occurs with quantifying\nvariation in other vowel variables: quantifying their relative frontness or backness,\ntenseness or laxness, and rounding or unrounding. Moreover, more than one\ndimension may be involved, e.g., amount of nasalization and frontness or\nbackness. In such cases usually some kind of weighting formula is devised, and\nwhen the data are treated it is these weights that are used in any calculations,\nnot just the ones and zeros that we can use in the case of (ng): [\u00ba] or [n], where\n[\u00ba] = 1 and [n] = 0.\nLinguists who have studied variation in this way have used a number of\nlinguistic variables. The (ng) variable has been widely used. So has the (r)variable.\nOthers are the (h) variable in words like house and hospital, i.e., (h): [h] or \u00d8;\nAITC06 143 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 144 Language Variation\nthe (t) variable in bet and better, i.e., (t): [t] or [?]; the (th) and (dh) variables\nin thin and they, i.e., (th): [\u03b8] or [t] and (dh): [\u00a8] or [d]; the (l) variable in French\nin il, i.e., (l): [l] or \u00d8; and consonant variables like the final (t) and (d) in words\nlike test and told, i.e., their presence or absence. Vocalic variables used have\nincluded the vowel (e) in words like pen and men; the (o) in dog, caught, and\ncoffee; the (e) in beg; the (a) in back, bag, bad, and half; and the (u) in pull.\nStudies of variation employing the linguistic variable are not confined solelyto\nphonological matters. Investigators have looked at the (s) of the third-personsin-\ngular, as in he talks, i.e., its presence or absence; the occurrence or nonoccurrence\nof be (and of its various inflected forms) in sentences such as He\u2019s happy, He\nbe happy, and He happy; the occurrence (actually, virtual nonoccurrence) of the\nnegative particle ne in French; various aspects of the phenomenon of multiple\nnegation in English, e.g., He don\u2019t mean no harm to nobody; and the beginnings\nof English relative clauses, as in She is the girl who(m) I praised, She is the girl\nthat I praised, and She is the girl I praised.\nTo see how individual researchers choose variables, we can look briefly at\nthree studies. In a major part of his work in New York City, Labov (1966) chose\nfive phonological variables: the (th) variable, the initial consonant in words like\nthin and three; the (dh) variable, the initial consonant in words like there and\nthen; the (r) variable, r-pronunciation in words like farm and far; the (a) vari-\nable, the pronunciation of the vowel in words like bad and back; and the (o)\nvariable, the pronunciation of the vowel in words like dog and caught. Weshould\nnote that some of these have discrete variants, e.g., (r): [r] or \u00d8, whereas others\nrequire the investigator to quantify the variants because the variation is a con-\ntinuous phenomenon, e.g., the (a) variable, where there can be both raising and\nretraction of the vowel, i.e., a pronunciation made higher and further back in\nthe mouth, and, of course, in some environments nasalization too.\nTrudgill (1974) also chose certain phonological variables in his study of the\nspeech of Norwich: three consonant variables and thirteen vowel variables. The\nconsonant variables were the (h) in happy and home, the (ng) in walking and\nrunning, and the (t) in bet and better. In the first two cases only the presence\nor absence of h-pronunciation and the [\u00ba] versus [n] realizations of (ng) were of\nconcern to Trudgill. In the last there were four variants of (t) to consider: an\naspirated variant; an unaspirated one; a glottalized one; and a glottal stop.\nThese variants were ordered, with the first two combined and weighted as being\nleast marked as nonstandard, the third as more marked, and the last, the glottal\nstop, as definitely marked as nonstandard. The thirteen vowel variables were\nthe vowels used in words such as bad, name, path, tell, here, hair, ride, bird,\ntop, know, boat, boot, and tune. Most of these had more than two variants, so\nweighting, i.e., some imposed quantification, was again required to differentiate\nthe least preferred varieties, i.e., the most nonstandard, from the most preferred\nvariety, i.e., the most standard.\nThe Detroit study (Shuy et al., 1968) focused on the use of three variables:\none phonological variable and two grammatical variables. The phonological\nvariable was the realization of a vowel plus a following nasal consonant as a\nnasalized vowel, e.g., bin realized as [bh] rather than [bin]. The grammatical\nvariables were multiple negation, which I have already mentioned, andpronominal\nAITC06 144 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 145\napposition, e.g., That guy, he don\u2019t care. In a further study of Detroit speech,\nWolfram (1969) considered certain other linguistic variables. These included the\npronunciation of final consonant clusters, i.e., combinations of final consonants\nin words like test, wasp, and left, th in words like tooth and nothing, final stops\nin words like good and shed, and r-pronouncing in words like sister and pair.\nSo far as grammatical variables were concerned, Wolfram looked at matters\nsuch as he talk\/talks, two year\/years, she nice\/she\u2019s nice, he\u2019s ready\/he ready\/he\nbe ready, and multiple negation as in He ain\u2019t got none neither.\nThis brief sample indicates some of the range of variables that have been\ninvestigated. The important fact to remember is that a linguistic variable is an\nitem in the structure of a language, an item that has alternate realizations, as\none speaker realizes it one way and another a different way or the same speaker\nrealizes it differently on different occasions. For example, one speaker may say\nsinging most of the time whereas another prefers singin\u2019, but the first is likely\nto say singin\u2019 on occasion just as the second may be found to use the occasional\nsinging. What might be interesting is any relationship we find between these\nhabits and either (or both) the social class to which each speaker belongs or the\ncircumstances which bring about one pronunciation rather than the other.\nLabov (1972b) has also distinguished among what he calls indicators,markers,\nand stereotypes. An indicator is a linguistic variable to which little or no social\nimport is attached. Only a linguistically trained observer is aware of indicators.\nFor example, some speakers in North America distinguish the vowels in cot and\ncaught and others do not. Whether one distinguishes the vowels or not carries\nlittle or no social significance. On the other hand, a marker does carry with it\nsocial significance. In fact, markers may be potent carriers of social information.\nPeople are aware of markers, and the distribution of markers is clearly related\nto social groupings and to styles of speaking. Pronouncing car and cart in New\nYork City in their r-less varieties marks you as using a type of pronunciation\nassociated with lower-class speech in that city. New Yorkers are conscious of\nthis fact and may vary their use of r according to circumstances. A stereotype\nis a popular and, therefore, conscious characterization of the speech of a par-\nticular group: New York boid for bird or Toitytoid Street for 33rd Street; Texas\n\u2018drawling\u2019 or Howdy Pardner; a Northumbrian Wot-cher (What cheer?)greeting;\nthe British use of chap; or a Bostonian\u2019s Pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd. Often\nsuch stereotypes are stigmatized. A stereotype need not conform to reality;rather,\nit offers people a rough and ready categorization with all the attendantproblems\nof such categorizations. Studies of variation tend therefore to focus ondescribing\nthe distributions of linguistic variables which are markers; they may explainhow\nstereotypes arise, but they merely note indicators. (See Johnstone, 2004, for a\ndiscussion of stereotypes in Pittsburgh speech.)\nDiscussion\n1. The word shibboleth is of biblical origin (see Judges 12: 4\u20136). In this case\ninformation from a \u2018survey\u2019 concerning a particular linguistic variable was\nput to immediate and, for many, drastic use. Explain.\nAITC06 145 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 146 Language Variation\n2. Try to devise a scale or some kind of quantification for the variants of the\nvariable (a) found in words like bat, bad, back, bag, and bang. You will\nhave to note quite fine phonetic differences. What difficulties arise? Try to\nplace your own pronunciations of the vowels in these words on the scale as\nwell as the pronunciations of some other people you know. In doing this\nkind of task, what social judgments do you yourself make of the variants?\n3. Which linguistic variables might be usefully investigated in the part of the\nworld in which you live; that is, what kinds of variation have you noticed\naround you, and how might you characterize the variation using the con-\ncept of the \u2018linguistic variable\u2019?\n4. I have suggested that certain linguistic variables are particularly marked,\ni.e., speakers and listeners are acutely aware of them. We immediately notice\neither the presence or absence of something. One consequence is that all a\nspeaker must do is use a single instance of the \u2018wrong\u2019 variant, e.g., dropan\nh when he or she should not, to reveal that the middle-class style being used\nis actually overlaid on a working-class one. Can you think of otherexamples\nof this phenomenon, when someone \u2018gives himself or herself away\u2019 by using\na linguistic feature in such a way? (Note that it is also possible to give away\nyour middle-class or upper-class origins while pretending to be workingclass.)\n5. In his Prologue to The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer says the following of the\nKnight:\nHe nevere yet no vileyne ne sayde\nIn al his lyf unto no maner wight.\nThis use of multiple negation was common in both Old English and Middle\nEnglish. Although it still persists, it is now highly marked as nonstandard.\nTry to find out why this variant of negation has fallen into such disfavor\n(and who actually disfavors it). See Crystal (1984), Bauer and Trudgill\n(1998), and Wardhaugh (1999).\nLinguistic and Social Variation\nOnce we have identified the linguistic variable as our basic working tool, the\nnext task becomes one of employing that tool in an effort to see how linguistic\nvariation relates to social variation. An early study of linguistic variation by\nGumperz (1958), but one cast in a \u2018modern\u2019 mold, shows some of the intricacies\ninvolved in trying to relate linguistic variation to social variation. Because the\nsociety he was studying is rigidly stratified on the basis of caste membership, the\nproblems are considerably fewer than those encountered in such cities as New\nYork, Detroit, or even Norwich, but they are still present. Gumperz shows how\nrather small differences in speech can effectively distinguish sub-groups insociety\nfrom one another in a study of linguistic usage in the village of Khalapur, eighty\nmiles north of Delhi in India. The social structure of the village is determined\nAITC06 146 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 147\nby Hindu caste membership with Brahmans at the top, then Rajputs (warriors),\nVaishyas (merchants), and several groups of artisans and laborers lower down.\nAt the bottom are three untouchable castes: Chamars (landless laborers), Jatia\nChamars (leather workers and shoe makers), and Bhangis (sweepers). The latter\nare restricted to living in certain neighborhoods and have less freedom to move\nin the village than do members of the upper castes. Ten percent of the popula-\ntion are not Hindus but Muslims; they are outside the caste system.\nSo far as language is concerned, certain characteristics of the Khalapur village\ndialect are clear markers of social-group membership. For example, Bhangis do\nnot make certain phonological contrasts that speakers of all the other castes\nmake. Chamars and Jatia Chamars also lack certain phonological contrasts\nmade by all others, and some, in attempting to make such a contrast, actually\nhypercorrect; that is, they over-extend a particular usage in trying to emulate\nothers. Jatia Chamars have a characteristic pronunciation of words that end\nin [\u00e6] in all other village varieties. Each of the three untouchable castes there-\nfore has speech characteristics that clearly set it off both from the other two\nuntouchable castes and from the touchable castes in the village. Muslim speech\nresembles that of the touchable classes.\nAn anomaly is that the variety of village speech spoken by the lowest caste,\nthe Bhangis, is closest to the dialect of the region in which Khalapur is situated.\nThis fact constrains members of the upper castes in their use of the regional\ndialect since using it would make them sound like untouchables. In their lin-\nguistic usage therefore they are forced to innovate away from the regionalvariety.\nSince untouchables apparently try to emulate the touchables, the direction of\ninnovation for all groups in Khalapur is away from the regional variety with\nthe innovations prompted, of course, by different needs: the touchables\u2019 need\nto signal their clear distinction from the untouchables, and the untouchables\u2019\nattempt to reduce that distinction as much as possible.\nThis study quite clearly shows a direct relationship between linguistic vari-\nation and caste membership. If we know certain things about one, we canpredict\ncertain things about the other. It is just such connections or correlations that\ninterest sociolinguists working with the linguistic variable. What they seek are\nmeasures of social variation to which they can relate the kinds of linguistic\nvariation they observe. However, caste, with its sharp social stratifications, is\nuseless as a measure of social variation outside a few non-Western societies.\nConsequently, the problem becomes one of finding factors in society that show\na relationship to such matters as whether or not an individual says singing or\nsingin\u2019, he go or he goes, or He doesn\u2019t know anything or He don\u2019t knownothing.\nOnce a linguistic variable has been identified, the next issue becomes that of\ncollecting data concerning its variants in such a way that we can draw certain\nconclusions about the social distribution of these variants. To draw such conclu-\nsions, we must be able to relate the variants in some way to quantifiable factors\nin society, e.g., social-class membership, gender, age, ethnicity, and so on. As we\nwill see, there are numerous difficulties in attempting this task, but considerable\nprogress has been made in overcoming them, particularly as studies have built\non those that have gone before in such a way as to strengthen the quality of the\nwork done in this area of sociolinguistics.\nAITC06 147 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 148 Language Variation\nWhile it is fairly easy to relate the occurrences of the variants of a linguistic\nvariable to factors such as gender and age, relating them to factors such as race\nand ethnicity is somewhat more troublesome since these are much moresubjective\nin nature and less easily quantifiable. But the most complicated factor of all is\nsocial-class membership, if we consider \u2018social class\u2019 to be a useful concept to\napply in stratifying society \u2013 and few indeed would deny its relevance! Sociolo-\ngists use a number of different scales for classifying people when they attempt\nto place individuals somewhere within a social system. An occupational scale\nmay divide people into a number of categories as follows: major professionals\nand executives of large businesses; lesser professionals and executives ofmedium-\nsized businesses; semi-professionals; technicians and owners of small businesses;\nskilled workers; semi-skilled workers; and unskilled workers. An educational\nscale may employ the following categories: graduate or professional education;\ncollege or university degree; attendance at college or university but no degree;\nhigh school graduation; some high school education; and less than seven years\nof formal education. Income level as well as source of income are important\nfactors in any classification system that focuses on how much money people\nhave. Likewise, in considering where people live, investigators must concern\nthemselves with both the type of housing and its location.\nIn assigning individuals to social classes, investigators may use any or all of\nthe above criteria (and others too) and assign different weights to them. Accord-\ningly, the resulting social-class designation given to any individual may differ\nfrom study to study. We can also see how social class itself is a sociological\nconstruct; people probably do not classify themselves as members of groups\ndefined by such criteria. Wolfram and Fasold (1974, p. 44) point out that \u2018there\nare other objective approaches [to establishing social groupings] not exclusively\ndependent on socio-economic ranking....An investigator may look at suchthings\nas church membership, leisure-time activities, or community organizations.\u2019 They\nadmit that such alternative approaches are not at all simple to devise but argue\nthat a classification so obtained is probably more directly related to social class\nthan the simple measurement of economic factors. We should note that there is\na current emphasis on \u2018lifestyle\u2019 in classifying people, so obviously patterns of\nconsumption of goods and appearance are important for a number of people in\narriving at some kind of social classification.\nAlternative approaches to using a somewhat simple social-class scale are,\nhowever, still rather infrequent. What we find is that people are assigned to\nsocial classes through the use of composite scores derived from various scales\nwhich \u2018measure\u2019 some of the factors mentioned above. It is also the case that the\nactual scales used must necessarily vary from community to community since\nexactly the same characteristics cannot serve to classify people in England and\nthe United States or in New England and New Mexico. However, as I have\nindicated, nearly all such scales take into account such matters as educational\nachievement, professional training, occupation (sometimes parental occupation\ntoo), \u2018blue\u2019- or \u2018white\u2019-collar work, salary or income level, source of that salary,\nincome, or wage (this difference also being important), gender, age, residential\narea, race, and ethnicity. Weights are then assigned to each of these and some\nkind of unitary scale is devised so that individuals can be fitted into slots\nAITC06 148 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 149\ncarrying such designations as \u2018upper class,\u2019 \u2018middle class,\u2019 \u2018lower working class,\u2019\nand so on. Sometimes the stratifications, or gradations, are few (\u2018upper\u2019 vs.\n\u2018middle\u2019 class), but at other times they are many (\u2018upper middle\u2019 vs. \u2018middle\nmiddle\u2019 class). Most work in sociolinguistics has drawn on commonly used uni-\ntary scales of this kind to designate the social-class membership of individuals\nin an attempt to describe the characteristic linguistic behavior of various social\nclasses.\nIn his study of linguistic variation in New York City, Labov (1966) used the\nthree criteria of education, occupation, and income to set up ten social classes.\nHis class 0, his lower class, had grade school education or less, were laborers,\nand found it difficult to make ends meet. His classes 1 to 5, his working class,\nhad had some high school education, were blue-collar workers, but earned\nenough to own such things as cars. His classes 6 to 8, his lower middle class,\nwere high school graduates and semi-professional and white-collar workers who\ncould send their children to college. His highest class 9, his upper middle class,\nwere well educated and professional or business-oriented. In this classification\nsystem for people in the United States about 10 percent of the population are\nsaid to be lower class, about 40 percent working class, another 40 percent lower\nmiddle class, and the remaining 10 percent fall into the upper middle class or\nan upper class, the latter not included in Labov\u2019s study. In his later study (2001)\nof variation in Philadelphia Labov used a socio-economic index based on occupa-\ntion, education, and house value.\nIn his study of linguistic variation in Norwich, England, Trudgill (1974) dis-\ntinguishes five social classes: middle middle class (MMC), lower middle class\n(LMC), upper working class (UWC), middle working class (MWC), and lower\nworking class (LWC). Trudgill interviewed ten speakers from each of five elec-\ntoral wards in Norwich plus ten school-age children from two schools. These\nsixty informants were then classified on six factors, each of which was scored\non a six-point scale (0\u20135): occupation, education, income, type of housing,\nlocality, and father\u2019s occupation. Trudgill himself decided the cut-off points\namong his classes. In doing so, he shows a certain circularity. His lower working\nclass is defined as those who use certain linguistic features (e.g., he go) more\nthan 80 percent of the time. Out of the total possible score of 30 on his com-\nbined scales, those scoring 6 or less fall into this category. Members of Trudgill\u2019s\nmiddle middle class always use he goes, and that behavior is typical of those\nscoring 19 or more. His study is an attempt to relate linguistic behavior to social\nclass, but he uses linguistic behavior to assign membership in social class. What\nwe can be sure of is that there is a difference in linguistic behavior between\nthose at the top and bottom of Trudgill\u2019s 30-point scale, but this difference is\nnot one that has been established completely independently because of the\nunderlying circularity.\nShuy\u2019s Detroit study (Shuy et al., 1968) attempted to sample the speech of\nthat city using a sample of 702 informants. Eleven field workers collected the\ndata by means of a questionnaire over a period of ten weeks. They assigned each\nof their informants to a social class using three sets of criteria: amount of\neducation, occupation, and place of residence. Each informant was ranked on\na six- or seven-point scale for each set, the rankings were weighted (multiplied\nAITC06 149 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 150 Language Variation\nby 5 for education, 9 for occupation, and 6 for residence), and each informant\nwas given a social-class placement. Four social-class designations were used:\nupper middle class, those with scores of 20\u201348; lower middle class, those with\nscores of 49\u201377; upper working class, those with scores of 78\u2013106; and lower\nworking class, those with scores of 107\u2013134.\nThere are some serious drawbacks to using social-class designations of this\nkind. As Bainbridge (1994, p. 4023) says:\nWhile sociolinguists without number have documented class-related variation in\nspeech, hardly any of them asked themselves what social class was. They treated\nclass as a key independent variable, with variations in speech dependent upon class\nvariations, yet they never considered the meaning of the independent variable. In\nconsequence, they seldom attempted anything like a theory of why class should\nhave an impact, and even more rarely examined their measures of class to see if\nthey were methodologically defensible.\nWoolard (1985, p. 738) expresses a similar view: \u2018sociolinguists have often\nborrowed sociological concepts in an ad hoc and unreflecting fashion, not usu-\nally considering critically the implicit theoretical frameworks that are imported.\u2019\nShe adds (p. 739), \u2018However, to say that our underlying social theories are in\nneed of examination, elaboration, or reconsideration is not to say that the work\nsociolinguists have done or the concepts we have employed are without merit.\u2019\n(See also Horvath\u2019s comment cited on p. 11.)\nChambers (2003, ch. 2) wrestles with the problem of class as a category and\nwith what he calls the \u2018fuzziness\u2019 inherent in class boundaries. He admits (p. 44)\nthat sociolinguists \u2018often rely on their intuitions in assigning social classes to\nindividuals in the sample population in their studies,\u2019 but avers (p. 44) that any\nsuch \u2018judgment sample\u2019 made by an experienced sociolinguist familiar with the\nregion under investigation \u2018carries few risks.\u2019 For Chambers it is apparently\nenough that the sociolinguist has an intuitive grasp of the social-class compo-\nsition of the group being investigated and chooses representative (or\u2018prototypical\u2019)\nindividuals using his or her own best judgment. He admits that this is not the\npreferred sociological method and reveals an \u2018abyss between the samplingmethods\nof sociolinguistic surveys and the type of survey represented by opinion polls\u2019\n(p. 45). He claims, however, that the particular sampling methods of sociolin-\nguistic investigation have been justified by their results, adding (p. 54) that the\nsocial stratification that interests sociolinguists is \u2018often crystal clear.\u2019\nChambers\u2019 view is an optimistic one. \u2018Class\u2019 is not a transparent concept and\n\u2018fuzziness\u2019 is ever present (see Ash, 2002, for an extended discussion). Can you\nclearly assign any John Doe or Jane Doe a class membership? Are the same\ncriteria applicable to all individuals in society, e.g., to both the black and white\ninhabitants of northern cities in the United States, and to both recent immi-\ngrants to London and the residents of Mayfair? Is class structure the same in\nboth the industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the same society? Do the\ncriteria for classification apply equally to John Doe and Jane Doe? Are the\ndifferent generations fairly treated? Another way of looking at John Doe is to\ntry to specify what kinds of groups he belongs to and then relate his various uses\nof language to membership in these groups. The obvious disadvantage of such\nAITC06 150 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 151\nan approach is the lack of generalizability of the results: we might be able to\nsay a lot about the linguistic behavior of John Doe vis-\u00e0-vis his membership in\nthese groups, but we would not be able to say anything at all about anyone\nelse\u2019s linguistic behavior. We can contrast this result with the statements we can\nmake from using the aforementioned social-class designations: they say some-\nthing about the linguistic usage of the \u2018middle middle class\u2019 without assuring us\nthat there is really such an entity as that class; nor do they guarantee us that\nwe can ever find a typical member.\nOne of the major problems in talking about social class is that social space\nis multi-dimensional whereas systems of social classification are one-dimensional.\nAs we have seen, at any particular moment, an individual locates himself or\nherself in social space according to the factors that are relevant to him or her\nat that moment. While he or she may indeed have certain feelings about being\na member of the lower middle class, at any moment it might be more important\nto be female, or to be a member of a particular church or ethnic group, or to\nbe an in-patient in a hospital, or to be a sister-in-law. That is, self-identification\nor role-playing may be far more important than some kind of fixed social-class\nlabeling. There need not, of course, be serious conflict between the two ap-\nproaches. Certain kinds of self-identification and roles to be played may correl-\nate quite closely with certain social-class labels, and they may be more \u2018real\u2019\nand immediate to people, in the sense of accounting more accurately for their\nbehavior from moment to moment.\nThe work of Labov, Trudgill, and others tries to describe the speech charac-\nteristics of members of social groups, that is, various sociolects. Traditionally,\nlinguists have been interested in idiolects, the speech characteristics and lin-\nguistic behavior of individuals. They have also maintained that, once freevariation\nis taken into account, an idiolect is highly representative of the linguistic behavior\nof all the speakers of that language. In fact, that is usually the approach linguists\nadopt in studying an exotic language: they find a speaker who is willing to serve\nas an informant, and they attempt to describe that speaker\u2019s language using\nappropriate field methods. They usually show little hesitation in generalizing\ntheir statements about that speaker\u2019s linguistic behavior to all speakers of the\nlanguage. Sociolects, however, are statements about group norms arrived at\nthrough counting and averaging. To the extent that the groups are real, that is,\nthat the members actually feel that they do belong to a group, a sociolect has\nvalidity; to the extent that they are not, it is just an artifact. In the extremely\ncomplex societies in which most of us live, there must always be some question\nas to the reality of any kind of social grouping: each of us experiences society\ndifferently, multiple-group membership is normal, and both change and stability\nseem to be natural conditions of our existence. We must therefore exercise a\ncertain caution about interpreting any claims made about \u2018lower working-class\nspeech,\u2019 \u2018upper middle-class speech,\u2019 or the speech of any other social group\ndesignated with a class label \u2013 or any label for that matter.\nDistinguishing among social classes in complex modern urban societies is\nprobably becoming more and more difficult. We are far removed from the caste\nsystem described by Gumperz (1958) in his village of Khalapur in India, or the\nclearly differentiated societies so often described by anthropologists. We are also\nAITC06 151 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 152 Language Variation\nconsiderably distanced from the rural societies favored by dialect geographers.\nCities like New York and London continue to change, and some would argue\nthat the process of change itself has actually speeded up \u2013 certainly the process\nof social change has. If such is the case, the very usefulness of \u2018social class\u2019 as\na concept that should be employed in trying to explain the distribution of\nparticular kinds of behavior, linguistic or otherwise, may need rethinking.\nIt was for reasons not unlike these that Milroy (1987a) preferred to explore\nnetwork relationships and the possible connection of these to linguisticvariation,\nrather than to use the concept of \u2018social class.\u2019 In her work, Milroy found that\nit was the network of relationships that an individual belonged to that exerted\nthe most powerful and interesting influences on that individual\u2019s linguistic\nbehavior. When the group of speakers being investigated shows little variation\nin social class, however that is defined, a study of the network of social rela-\ntionships within the group may allow you to discover how particular linguistic\nusages can be related to the frequency and density of certain kinds of contacts\namong speakers. Network relationships, however, tend to be unique in a way\nthat social-class categories are not. That is, no two networks are alike, and\nnetwork structures vary from place to place and group to group, e.g., in Belfast\nand Boston, or among Jamaican immigrants to London and Old Etonians. But\nwhom a person associates with regularly may be more \u2018real\u2019 than any feeling\nhe or she has of belonging to this or that social class. I will have more to say\nin the following chapter about this use of network structure in the study of lin-\nguistic variation. We will also see how the concept of \u2018communities of practice\u2019\nwill be helpful in understanding differences in language behavior.\nDiscussion\n1. How would you try to place individuals according to their social position\nin the community in which you live? What factors would you consider to\nbe relevant, and how would you weight each? What class designations\nwould seem appropriate? Where would you place yourself?\n2. Sociolinguists who have looked at variation in children\u2019s speech often assign\neach child to a social class. In doing so, they have almost always used\nmeasures pertaining to the father rather than to the mother: his occupation,\nincome, education, and so on. Corresponding characteristics of the mother\nmay be used for classification only if they produce a demonstrably higher\nrating for the child than those of the father. Would you recommend any\nchanges? If so, what changes and for what reasons?\n3. For his study of certain varieties of American English, Fries (1940) differ-\nentiated his subjects into social classes. Examine the criteria that Fries used\nand discuss their adequacy for the purposes he had in mind. Was this study\nby Fries also a study of linguistic variation?\n4. Is there an upper working class (or any other class) because a number of\npeople exhibit similar patterns of behavior, and is this a suitable designation\nfor them within society as a whole, or because these same people have a\nparticular view of their place in that society and behave accordingly? That\nAITC06 152 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 153\nis, is social structure continuously created and re-created out of the behavior\nof individuals, or is individual behavior fashioned to meet the requirements\nof an ongoing social structure? Or is this just a riddle best left tophilosophers?\nData Collection and Analysis\nOnce an investigator has made some decision concerning which social variablesmust\nbe taken into account and has formed a hypothesis about a possible relationship\nbetween social and linguistic variation, the next task becomes one of collecting\ndata that will either confirm or refute that hypothesis. In sociolinguistics, this\ntask has two basic dimensions: devising some kind of plan for collecting relevant\ndata, and then collecting such data from a representative sample of speakers. As\nwe will see, neither task is an easy one.\nAn immediate problem is one that I have previously referred to (p. 19) as the\n\u2018observer\u2019s paradox.\u2019 How can you obtain objective data from the real world\nwithout injecting your own self into the data and thereby confounding the\nresults before you even begin? How can you be sure that the data you have\ncollected are uncontaminated by the process of investigation itself? This is a\nbasic scientific quandary, particularly observable in the social sciences where, in\nalmost every possible situation, there is one variable that cannot be controlled\nin every possible way, namely, the observer\/recorder\/analyst\/investigator\/theorist\nhimself or herself. If language varies as much as it does, the presence of an\nobserver will have some effect on that variation. How can we minimize this\neffect? Even data recorded by remote means, e.g., by hidden cameras and sound\nrecorders, may not be entirely \u2018clean\u2019 and will require us to address additional\nethical issues. We know, too, that observations vary from observer to observer\nand that we must confront the issue of the reliability of any observations that\nwe make. Sociolinguists are aware that there are several serious issues here, and,\nas we will see, they have attempted to deal with them.\nThe usual kind of data collection device is a questionnaire designed to elicit\ndata illustrative of the use of the variable or variables that are being investi-\ngated. Since experience has shown that the different variants of a variable occur\nin different circumstances, the questionnaire must be designed to elicit data in\na variety of circumstances. Many studies have made a four-fold distinction in\ncategorizing those circumstances: (1) a casual situation, with sub-categories such\nas speech outside the formal interview, or conversation with a third party (i.e.,\nnot the person doing the interviewing), or responses to general questions, or\nrecall of childhood rhymes, or the narration of a story about feeling one\u2019s life\nto be in peril; (2) an interview situation; (3) the reading aloud of a story; and\n(4) the reading aloud of lists of words and of pairs of words like den and then.\nA questionnaire which elicits these various kinds of linguistic behaviors will\ncover very casual speech (the casual situation), more formal speech (the inter-\nview situation), and the most formal speech of all (the different reading tasks).\nA person who says shootin\u2019 when explaining how he at some time felt himself\nAITC06 153 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 154 Language Variation\nto be in mortal danger may well read the same word presented on a list asshoot-\ning, and someone who pronounces caught and court as homophones during an\ninterview may well distinguish them in some way when the words appear in\ncontrast with each other on a list of pairs of words.\nIn his work in New York City, Labov (1966) investigated both careful and\ncasual speech. His four types of careful speech, from most to least careful, were:\nreading lists of close pairs (e.g., den and then), reading lists of words, reading\na prose passage, and participating in a formal interview. His five types of casual\nspeech came from situations such as speech outside the formal interview, con-\nversation with a third party, responses to questions, telling childhood rhymes,\nand recounting an incident which might have proved fatal. This classification\ngave Labov a total of nine contextual styles for analysis in his work. He also\ninsisted that each style had to be accompanied by appropriate channel cues. In\nparticular, casual style had to be marked by such cues. These cues involved\nchanges of speech pitch, volume, and rate of breathing, and perhaps such things\nas outbursts of laughter. Labov regarded speech not accompanied by one or\nmore of these cues as formal rather than spontaneous and casual. Such cues\nmost often accompanied either the subject\u2019s breaking away from the topic of the\nrecorded interview to deal with some situation in the immediate environment,\ne.g., a family interruption, or a change of topic, particularly a change brought\nabout by Labov\u2019s asking subjects to talk about a narrow escape from death.\nLabov also included what he called a subjective reaction test in his question-\nnaire, requiring subjects to react to taped samples of speech containing the five\nvariables he was concerned with in his study. In this way he was able to com-\npare what informants said about their own and others\u2019 usage with their actual\nusage, note differences between the two, and hypothesize about the consequences\nfor such matters as linguistic change.\nTrudgill\u2019s questionnaire (1974, pp. 195\u2013201) required his subjects to answer\ncertain questions, e.g., \u2018What different parts of Norwich have you lived in?\u2019 and\n\u2018Which schools did you go to?\u2019 It also required that subjects read word listsaloud\n\u2018as naturally as you can,\u2019 and later \u2018as rapidly as you can,\u2019 and also to read pairs\nof words. The word lists contained words like paper, baker, silly, you, avoid, and\ngirl; the pairs lists contained pairs like boot\u2013boat, hair\u2013here, bust\u2013burst, daze\u2013\ndays, and moon\u2013moan. Questions about individual local words were also asked,\ne.g., \u2018Do you know what a \u201cdwile\u201d is?\u2019 and questions about Norwich itself, e.g.,\n\u2018What do you think of Norwich as a place to live?\u2019 Trudgill then asked his\nsubjects to read aloud a short story \u2018as naturally as you can,\u2019 to make judgments\nabout Norwich speech (\u2018Do you like the way people in Norwich speak?\u2019), to\nlisten to certain pronunciations of words and judge whether or not they them-\nselves used those pronunciations, and to judge ten paired sets of words in order\nto \u2018tick which way you think is correct, and then...underline the way you say\nit yourself, either if it\u2019s the same or different.\u2019\nThe other part of the linguist\u2019s task is sampling: finding a representative group\nof speakers. The conclusions we draw about the behavior of any group are only\nas good as the sample on which we base our conclusions. If we choose thesample\nbadly, we cannot generalize beyond the actual group that comprised the sample.\nIf we intend to make claims about the characteristics of a population, we must\nAITC06 154 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 155\neither assess every member of that population for those characteristics or sample\nthe whole population in some way. Sampling a population so as to generalize\nconcerning its characteristics requires considerable skill. A genuine sample drawn\nfrom the population must be thoroughly representative and completelyunbiased.\nAll parts of the population must be adequately represented, and no part should\nbe overrepresented or underrepresented, thereby creating bias of some kind.\nThe best sample of all is a random sample. In a random sample everyone in\nthe population to be sampled has an equal chance of being selected. In contrast,\nin a judgment sample the investigator chooses the subjects according to a set of\ncriteria, e.g., age, gender, social class, education, and so on. Sometimes, too, it\nis the investigator who judges each of these categories, e.g., to which social class\na subject belongs. A judgment sample is obviously less adequate than a random\nsample. However, it is the kind of sample preferred in most sociolinguistic\nstudies (see Chambers, 2003, pp. 44\u20135).\nIn sampling the speech of the Lower East Side in New York City, Labov did\nnot use a completely random sample because such a sample would have pro-\nduced subjects who were not native to the area, e.g., immigrants from abroad\nand elsewhere in the United States. He used the sampling data from a previous\nsurvey that had been made by Mobilization for Youth, a random sample which\nused 1,000 informants. Labov\u2019s own sample size was eighty-nine. He employed\na stratified sample, i.e., one chosen for specific characteristics, from that survey.\nHe also wanted to be sure that he had representatives of certain groups which\nhe believed to exist on the Lower East Side. When he could not, for various\nreasons, interview some of the subjects chosen in the sample, he tried to find out\nby telephoning the missing subjects if his actual sample had been made unrep-\nresentative by their absence. He was able to contact about half of his missing\nsubjects in this way and, on the basis of these brief telephone conversations, he\ndecided that his actual sample was unbiased and was typical of the total popu-\nlation he was interested in surveying.\nThe Detroit study (Shuy et al., 1968) initially collected data from 702 inform-\nants in the city. However, the data used for the actual analysis came from only\nthirty-six informants chosen from this much larger number. In selecting these\nthirty-six, the investigators wanted to be sure that each informant used had been\na resident of Detroit for at least ten years, was \u2018representative,\u2019 had given a\nsuccessful interview, and had provided an adequate amount of taped material\nfor analysis. In other words, to any initial biases that might have been createdin\nchoosing the first set of 702 informants was added the possibility of still further\nbias by choosing non-randomly from the data that had become available. This\nis not to suggest that any such biases vitiate the results: they do not appear to\ndo so. Rather, it is to point out that the kinds of concerns sociolinguists have\nabout data and sources of data have not necessarily been the same as those of\nstatisticians.\nWolfram (1969) chose forty-eight black informants from those interviewed in\nthe Detroit study. These informants were evenly divided into four social classes\nused in that study. Each group of twelve was further divided into three age\ngroups: four informants in the 10\u201312 age group, four in the 14\u201317 age group,\nand four in the 30\u201355 age group. Wolfram also selected twelve white informants\nAITC06 155 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 156 Language Variation\nfrom the highest social class in the Detroit project, again by age and sex.\nWolfram\u2019s study therefore used a total of sixty informants: twenty-four (twelve\nwhite and twelve black) from the upper middle class and thirty-six who were\nblack and were members of the working classes, with equal numbers in each\nsuch class. Such a sample is very obviously highly stratified in nature.\nStudies employing the linguistic variable are essentially correlational innature:\nthat is, they attempt to show how the variants of a linguistic variable are related\nto social variation in much the same way that we can show how children\u2019s ages,\nheights, and weights are related to one another. We must distinguish between\ndependent variables and independent variables. The linguistic variable is a\ndependent variable, the one we are interested in. We want to see what happens\nto language when we look at it in relation to some factor we can manipulate,\nthe independent variable, e.g., social class, age, gender, ethnicity, and so on:\nas one of these changes, what happens to language? As Chambers (2003, p. 26)\nexpresses it, \u2018Socially significant linguistic variation requires correlation: the\ndependent (linguistic) variable must change when some independent variable\nchanges. It also requires that the change be orderly: the dependent variable must\nstratify the subjects in ways that are socially or stylistically coherent.\u2019\nThis kind of sociolinguistic investigation is often called quantitative sociolin-\nguistics and it is, as I have indicated previously, for some sociolinguists the\n\u2018heart of sociolinguistics\u2019 (Chambers, 2003, p. xix). Quantitative studies must\ntherefore be statistically sound if they are to be useful. Investigators must be\nprepared to employ proper statistical procedures not only in their sampling but\nalso in the treatment of the data they collect and in testing the various hypo-\ntheses they formulate. They must be sure that what they are doing is both valid\nand reliable. In our case the issue of validity, that is, whether or not the\nsociolinguist is really measuring what he or she is claiming to be measuring,\nhardly ever arises. Such work certainly meets Lepper\u2019s criterion (2000, p. 173):\n\u2018the researcher must show that what is being described is accurately \u201cnamed\u201d\n\u2013 that is, that the research process has accurately represented a phenomenon\nwhich is recognizable to the scientific community being addressed.\u2019 However,\nthe issue of reliability, that is, how objective and consistent the measurements\nof the actual linguistic data are, is a real and pressing one. There are well-known\nprocedures for making sure that the data we gather have been collected reliably,\nand there are approved tests of that reliability. However, in some sociolinguistic\ninvestigations little attention is paid to this issue. We are simply presented with\nsums of informants\u2019 responses or averages of one kind or another, and given\nlittle or no account of how confident we can be concerning the actual items\nsummed or averaged. If only one person collected the data, how consistent was\nthat person in the actual collection? If two or more were involved, how consist-\nently and uniformly did they employ whatever criteria they were using? Bailey\nand Tillery (2004, pp. 27\u20138) have identified a cluster of such issues, e.g., the\neffects of different interviewers, elicitation strategies, sampling procedures, and\nanalytical strategies, and pointed out that these can produce significant effects\non the data that are collected and, consequently, on any results that are\nreported. Therefore, there may still be room for improving the reliability of our\nresults.\nAITC06 156 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 157\nSerious empirical studies also require experimental hypotheses to be stated\nbefore the data are collected, and suitable tests to be chosen to decide whether\nthese hypotheses are confirmed or not and with what degree of confidence. Such\ntests often require that the data collected be treated quantifiably, so that the\nvariation in the actual distribution of the various responses is taken into account\nin each category. It is not enough just to calculate simple means or averages. The\nstandard deviation, that is, the actual distribution of the various measurements\naround those means, is critical if we wish to compare different means, which is\na standard procedure in sociolinguistics. Peculiar kinds of variations around\nmeans, e.g., skewing or bi-modal distributions, must also be noted.\nPetyt (1980, pp. 188\u201390) points out how the kinds of figures that sociolin-\nguists use in their tables may be misleading in a very serious way. Sociolinguists\nstratify society into sub-groups, the members of which are measured in certain\nways, and then these measurements are pooled. Individual variation is elimin-\nated. Petyt (p. 189) provides the data given in table 6.1. The data come from\nan investigation of h-dropping in West Yorkshire, and the table shows the means\nfor five sub-groups, i.e., social classes. Petyt points out that, if the range of vari-\nation within each sub-group is also acknowledged to be of consequence, there\nis a considerable overlap among the performances of individuals, so that \u2018it is\nnot the case that this continuum can be divided in such a way that the members\nof each social class fall within a certain range, and members of other classes\nfall outside this.\u2019 He indicates the range of individual scores in table 6.2, and\nadds that \u2018in the case of Classes II and V the bracketed figures indicate what the\nrange would have been had there not in each case been one individual whose\nspeech was markedly \u201cstatus incongruent.\u201d If these two individuals had not\nformed part of the sample the figures would look more \u201cregular,\u201d but there\nwould still not be \u201cdiscrete groups which are relatively unified in their linguistic\nbehavior.\u201d\u2019 There is considerable overlap.\nIn cases like this it is quite obvious that if we look only at means we are\ntempted to say one thing, whereas if we consider the distribution of responses\nTable 6.1 H-dropping: means for five social groups\nI II III IV V\n96 64 43 21 17\nSource: Petyt (1980, p. 189)\nTable 6.2 H-dropping: within-group ranges for five social groups\nI II III IV V\n81\u2013100 7\u2013100 2\u2013100 0\u201386 0\u201380\n(40\u2013100) (0\u201337)\nSource: Petyt (1980, p. 189)\nAITC06 157 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 158 Language Variation\nA B\nAmount of X\nNumber of individuals\nFigure 6.3 X for two groups, A and B\nwithin each class we may draw some other conclusion. But the overriding issue\nis that there are approved procedures to help investigators to decide how far\nthey can be confident that any differences that they observe to exist among the\nvarious classes, that is, among the various means, are due to something other\nthan errors in measurement or peculiarities of distribution. Such procedures\nrequire an investigator not only to calculate the means for each class, but also\nto assess the amount of variation in the responses within each class, and then\nto test pairs of differences of means among the classes using a procedure which\nwill indicate what likelihood there is that any difference found occurs by chance,\ne.g., one chance in twenty.\nMost social scientists employing statistical procedures regard this last level\nof significance as a suitable test of a hypothesis. In other words, unless their\nstatistical procedures indicate that the same results would occur by chance in\nfewer than one case in twenty, they will not say that two groups differ in some\nrespect or on a particular characteristic; that is, they insist that their claims be\nsignificant at what they call the 0.05 level of significance. We are also muchmore\nlikely to find two means to be significantly different if they are obtained from\naveraging a large number of observations than a small number.\nFigure 6.3 provides a further illustration of the problems inherent in compar-\ning populations in this way. The two groups A and B that are compared there\nfor characteristic X produce different mean scores and that difference may even\nbe statistically significant. However, there is an enormous overlap among indi-\nviduals in groups A and B \u2013 the shaded area. The majority of individuals in the\ntwo groups overlap in their X-ness, whatever that may be. It would be very\nunsafe indeed to make claims about the X-ness of the next person you meet\nfrom either group A or group B.\nWhenever you look at results reported by sociolinguists, you should keep\nin mind the above-mentioned issues concerning the formulation of hypotheses\nand the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. Statisticians certainlykeep\nthem in mind in assessing the claims they make. In examining individual socio-\nlinguistic investigations, therefore, you must ask what exactly are thehypotheses;\nAITC06 158 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 159\nhow reliable are the methods used for collecting the data; what is the actual sig-\nnificance of results that are reported on a simple graph or histogram; and what\ndo the findings tell us about the initial hypotheses. Anyone who attempts to do\nserious work in sociolinguistics must address himself or herself to such issues.\nLikewise, anyone who wishes to draw conclusions about either the structure of\nlanguage or how language varies within groups or between groups must ask the\nsame questions of data that someone presents to support this or that conclusion.\nSome sociolinguists have tended not to be very rigorous in their statistical treat-\nments, but this has not stopped them from drawing very strong conclusions,\nwhich seem \u2018obvious\u2019 and \u2018interesting\u2019 to them; whether these conclusions are\n\u2018significant\u2019 in the sense of having met an appropriate statistical test of a well-\nstated hypothesis may not be a concern.\nMilroy and Gordon (2003, p. 168) are aware that there may be problems\nhere. However, they ask: \u2018should we equate failure to achieve statistical signific-\nance with sociolinguistic irrelevance?\u2019 Their answer is that \u2018statistical tests, like\nall quantitative procedures are tools to provide insight into patterning in varia-\ntion. They must be used critically.\u2019 Dealing with a critic of Labov\u2019s work, Milroy\n(1992, p. 78) says:\nIt is not surprising that an anti-quantitative linguist should advocate confirmatory\nstatistical testing, but it is very important to understand the proposition putforward\nhere is simply wrong. If Labov\u2019s interpretations were suspect (and of course they\nare not), this would not arise from the fact that he failed to test for significance.\nThere was no reason for him to do so because the claims he wished to make were\nquite simple...and because in his analysis the same patterns were repeated for\nevery variable studied.\nAccording to Milroy, since this kind of sociolinguistic inquiry is \u2018exploratory\u2019\nin nature, it can be likewise \u2018exploratory\u2019 in its quantitative approach. Labov\u2019s\nmost recent work (2001) is still exploratory in nature but it is also extremely\nsophisticated in its sampling, data collection, and hypothesis-testing.Sociolinguists\nnow make increasing use of VARBRUL, a set of computer programs specifically\ndesigned to deal with the kinds of problems encountered in studies of variation\n(see Bayley, 2002, particularly pp. 124\u201334).\nDiscussion\n1. Look at the sampling techniques employed in studies of linguistic variation\nin large cities. How different is the sampling from the dialect-atlas type\nstudies? What weaknesses, if any, still exist? Look particularly at the workof\nsuch investigators as Labov, Trudgill, Shuy, Wolfram, and Fasold. You might\nalso care to look at Sivertsen\u2019s study (1960) of \u2018Cockney phonology,\u2019 using\nmainly four old ladies, Viereck\u2019s study (1966) of the English of Gateshead-\nupon-Tyne, using mainly a dozen old men, and DeCamp\u2019s study (1958\u20139)\nof San Francisco English, using a \u2018judgment\u2019 rather than a random sample.\n2. Sankoff (1974, p. 22) has described the problem of sampling in sociolin-\nguistic surveys as follows:\nAITC06 159 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 160 Language Variation\nTable 6.3 Percentage of non-RP forms for three consonants\n(ng):[n] (t):[>] (h):\u00d8\nMMC 31 41 6\nLMC 42 62 14\nUWC 87 89 40\nMWC 95 92 59\nLWC 100 94 61\nSource: Trudgill (1995, p. 36)\nA speech community sample need not include the large number of individuals\nusually required for other kinds of behavioural surveys. If people within a\nspeech community indeed understand each other with a high degree ofefficiency,\nthis tends to place a limit on the extent of possible variation, and imposes a\nregularity (necessary for effective communication) not found to the same extent\nin other kinds of social behaviour. The literature as well as our own experi-\nence would suggest that, even for quite complex speech communities, samples\nof more than about 150 individuals tend to be redundant, bringing increasing\ndata handling problems with diminishing analytical returns....It is crucial,\nhowever, that the sample be well chosen, and representative of all social sub-\nsegments about which one wishes to generalize.\nKeeping these words in mind, how might you go about trying to sample the\npopulation of some town or city with which you are familiar so that you\nwill be able to account for any linguistic variation that exists there?\n3. Wells (1982, pp. xviii\u2013xix) provides the following set of 24 \u2018keywords\u2019 for\nuse in dialect studies in either Britain or North America: kit, dress, trap, lot,\nstrut, foot, bath, cloth, nurse, fleece, face, palm, thought, goat, goose, price,\nchoice, mouth, near, square, start, north, force, and cure. All the sounds in\nthese words are relevant. Foulkes and Docherty (1999) add happy, letter,\nhorse, and comma to this list but only for their final unstressed vowels. Ask\npeople you know who come from different parts of the English-speaking\nworld to pronounce these words and record the different pronunciations\nyou find.\n4. Given information of the kind contained in table 6.3, and no supporting\nexplanations of how each mean (expressed as a percentage) was determined,\nwhat can you say with confidence about the linguistic behavior of members\nof each of the groups mentioned and about the reported differences in\nbehavior between the various groups? Can you be more confident of some\nconclusions than of others? You might consider questions such as the fol-\nlowing: How important are the differences among the various working\nclasses (UWC, MWC, and LWC)? Between the middle classes (MMC and\nLMC)? Between the middle classes as a whole and the working classes as\na whole? Between the LMC and the UWC? How does performance on the\n(h) variable appear to be different from performance on the (ng) and (t)\nAITC06 160 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Language Variation 161\nvariables in all social classes? Is there any difference in performance on the\n(ng) and (t) variables? What other kinds of information would you require\nto strengthen any conclusions you would wish to draw?\nFurther Reading\nHighly recommended for coverage of issues discussed in this chapter and the\ntwo following chapters are Chambers et al. (2002), Milroy and Gordon (2003),\nand Chambers (2003). Linn (1998) is also useful and Wolfram and Schilling-\nEstes (1998) contains a very useful appendix on American English entitled\n\u2018An Inventory of Socially Diagnostic Structures.\u2019 For the use of statistics in\nlinguistics see Sankoff (1978, 1985).\nAITC06 161 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 162 Some Findings and Issues\n7 Some Findings and Issues\nHaving looked briefly at some of the problems investigators face in using the\nconcept of the \u2018linguistic variable\u2019 to examine linguistic variation in society, I\ncan now turn to some representative quantitative studies. I will look at only a\nfew, and then at only certain of their findings; to deal with all such studies at\nlength would require several book-length treatments. I will comment on various\nparts of the studies selected to show something of the range of concerns that\ninvestigators have had and to indicate the kinds of problems they have faced.\nI will also look at certain claims that have been made concerning the relevance\nthese studies have to achieving a better understanding of the structure of lan-\nguage and of its acquisition and use.\nAn Early Study\nOne of the earliest studies of variation was Fischer\u2019s study (1958) of the (ng)vari-\nable, i.e., pronunciations like singing [\u00ba] versus singin\u2019 [n]. We should observe\nthat there is a long history of both the [\u00ba] and [n] variants in the language, that\nstigmatization of the [n] variant is a phenomenon of the nineteenth andtwentieth\ncenturies, and that even today in some circles in the United Kingdom,necessarily\nprivileged ones, people still go huntin\u2019, shootin\u2019, and fishin\u2019, not hunting, shoot-\ning, and fishing.\nAs part of a study of child-rearing practices in a New England community,\nFischer conducted interviews with young children, twelve boys and twelve girls,\naged 3\u201310. He noted their use of [\u00ba] and [n] in a very formal situation during\nthe administration of the Thematic Apperception Test, in a less formal interview,\nand in an informal situation in which the children discussed recent activities.\nTable 7.1 shows that boys used more -in\u2019 forms than girls in the most formal\nsituation.\nFischer also compared the use of [\u00ba] and [n] of a boy described by his teachers\nas a \u2018model\u2019 boy with that of a boy described as a \u2018typical\u2019 boy. The model boy\nworked well in school and was described as being popular, thoughtful, and\nconsiderate; the typical boy was described as being strong, mischievous, and\napparently unafraid of being caught doing something he should not be doing.\nAITC07 162 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Some Findings and Issues 163\nTable 7.1 Preferences for -ing and -in\u2019 endings, by sex\n-ing > -in\u2019 -ing < -in\u2019\nBoys 5 7\nGirls 10 2\nSource: Fischer (1958, p. 48)\nTable 7.2 Preferences of two boys for -ing and -in\u2019 endings\n-ing -in\u2019\n\u2018Model\u2019 boy 38 1\n\u2018Typical\u2019 boy 10 12\nSource: Fischer (1958, p. 49)\nTable 7.3 Preferences for -ing and -in\u2019 endings, by formality of situation\nMost Formal Informal\nformal interview interview\n-ing 38 33 24\n-in\u2019 1 35 41\nSource: Fischer (1958, p. 50)\nIn the most formal situation these two boys produced the numbers of instances\nof -ing and -in\u2019 reported in table 7.2. However, Fischer further observed that\nthe model boy also used -in\u2019 more as the formality of the situation decreased,\nas can be seen in table 7.3. He observed several more interesting facts. As chil-\ndren relaxed in the most formal situation they produced more instances of -in\u2019.\nSuch usage was also associated with specific verbs, so that verbs like hit, chew,\nswim, and punch, i.e., verbs describing everyday activities, were much more\nlikely to be given -in\u2019 endings than more \u2018formal\u2019 verbs like criticize, correct,\nread, and visit. Fischer\u2019s conclusion (p. 51) is that \u2018the choice between the -ing\nand the -in\u2019 variants appears to be related to sex, class, personality (aggressive\/\ncooperative), and mood (tense\/relaxed) of the speaker, to the formality of the\nconversation and to the specific verb spoken.\u2019\nFischer\u2019s study, then, is a very simple account of the common linguistic vari-\nable (ng). It covers very few subjects, and employs very informal, even casual,\nmethods of data collection. There is also no attempt to subject the findings to\nstatistical testing. But there is also, of course, no attempt to make any profound\nclaims!\nAITC07 163 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 164 Some Findings and Issues\nDiscussion\n1. If you were interested in the same phenomenon as Fischer, the (ng) variable\namong young children, how would you design an investigation so that you\nwould be in a position to make much stronger claims than Fischer was able\nto make?\n2. What particular difficulties do you think there are in investigating children\u2019s\nlanguage that do not exist in investigating adults\u2019 language? How might you\ntry to get around these difficulties?\n3. Do you see any problems with the concepts of a \u2018model\u2019 boy and a \u2018typical\u2019\nboy; e.g., do you see some danger of circularity in the definitions?\nNew York City\nLabov\u2019s work in New York City is usually regarded as setting the pattern for\nquantitative studies of linguistic variation. Labov raised many of the issues that\nare still addressed and devised many methods for tackling these issues. One of\nhis earliest studies of linguistic variation was a small-scale investigation of the\n(r) variable (Labov, 1966). Labov believed that r-pronunciation after vowels was\nbeing reintroduced into New York speech from above, was a feature of the\nspeech of younger people rather than of older people, was more likely to occur\nas the formality level in speech increased, and would be more likely at the ends\nof words (floor) than before consonants (fourth). He set out to test these hy-\npotheses by walking around three New York City department stores (Saks,\nMacy\u2019s, and S. Klein), which were rather clearly demarcated by the social-class\ngroups to which they catered (high, middle, and low, respectively), and asking\nthe location of departments he knew to be situated on the fourth floor. When\nthe shop assistant answered, Labov would seek a careful repetition of \u2018fourth\nfloor\u2019 by pretending not to hear the initial response.\nTable 7.4 shows the incidence of r use that Labov found among individuals\nemployed in the three stores (Labov, 1972b, p. 51). The table shows that 32 and\n31 percent of the personnel approached in Saks and Macy\u2019s respectively used r\nin all possible instances but only 17 percent did so in S. Klein; 79 percent of the\nseventy-one employees in S. Klein who were approached did not use r at all, but\nonly 38 percent of the sixty-eight employees approached in Saks and 49 percent\nof the 125 employees approached in Macy\u2019s were r-less.\nSo far as the position of occurrence of r-pronunciation was concerned\n(i.e., before consonant vs. word final, and first response vs. repeated response),\nLabov found the distribution reported in figure 7.1. This figure shows that\nr-pronunciation was favored in Saks to a greater extent than in Macy\u2019s butmuch\nless so in S. Klein. Careful repetition of the utterance nearly always increased\nr-pronunciation, and pronunciation of the r was found more often in floor than\nAITC07 164 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Some Findings and Issues 165\nTable 7.4 Percentage of r-use in three New York City department stores\nSaks (%) Macy\u2019s (%) S.

Labov did not test his findings for statistical\nsignificance but the data clearly reveal the patterns I have just mentioned.\nA further analysis of the department store data showed that in Saks it was\nolder people who used r-pronunciation less. However, the data from S. Klein on\nthis point were quite inconclusive, and the results from Macy\u2019s pointed in a\ndirection completely opposite to that predicted: r-pronunciation actuallyincreased\nwith age. This fact led Labov to conclude that members of the highest and\nlowest social groups tend not to change their pronunciation after it becomes\nfixed in adolescence but members of middle social groups sometimes do, pos-\nsibly because of their social aspirations. He tested this last hypothesis later ina\nmore comprehensive study of New York City speech and found good confirma-\ntion for it.\nLabov claims that today in New York City pronunciations of words like\ncar and guard with the r pronounced are highly valued. They are associated\nwith the upper middle class even though members of that class do not always\nuse such pronunciations, nor do they use them on all occasions. We should note\nthat r-pronunciation has not always been highly valued in New York City. New\nYork City was r-pronouncing in the eighteenth century but became r-less in\nthe nineteenth, and r-lessness predominated until World War II. At that time\nr-pronunciation became prestigious again, possibly as a result of largepopulation\nmovements to the city; there was a shift in attitude toward r-pronunciation,from\napparent indifference to a widespread desire to adopt such pronunciation.\nThis desire is clearly demonstrated on subjective reaction tests carried out in\nthe 1960s. These tests required subjects to evaluate speech with and without\nr-pronunciation by asking subjects to judge the job prospects of people who\ndiffered only in their pronunciation of words containing r, and to say which of\ntwo pronunciations they used of words containing r. The tests showed that New\nYorkers in the upper middle class and under the age of 40 almost unanimously\napproved r-pronunciation even though fewer than half actually used r in all pos-\nsible instances. People below the age of 20 also used more r-pronunciation than\npeople between the ages of 20 and 40, a fact that would suggest r-pronunciation\nto be on the increase. Above the age of 40, approval fell off to about 60 percent\nand use showed a dramatic decline to less than 10 percent. Other classesexhibited\nmuch the same pattern of approval and use, though, in all cases except one, at\nmuch lower levels. In one case \u2013 that of the lower middle class \u2013 the use of r\nactually exceeded such use in the upper middle class in certain circumstances.\nNot only did lower middle-class speakers approve of r-pronunciation, but they\nalso tended to exceed what appear to be the norms for its use in the next highest\nclass in reading word lists and in pronouncing minimal pairs of words.\nWe should look at this last finding in more detail because Labov makes\nparticularly strong claims concerning it. Figure 7.2 shows the use of r by various\nsocial classes in different styles of speech, from the most casual type of speech\n(e.g., telling about a narrow escape from death) to the most formal type (e.g.,\nreading aloud a list of pairs of words like bit and bid and pa and par) (Labov,\n1966, p. 240). As we can see, the amount of r use increases by social class\nand by formality of style. But there is one noticeable exception: Labov\u2019s lower\nmiddle-class speakers out-perform his upper middle-class speakers on word lists\nAITC07 166 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Some Findings and Issues 167\n100\nSocioeconomic class (SEC)\n0\u20131Lower class\n2\u20134Working class\nSEC\n80 5\u20138Lower middle class\n6\u20138\n9 Upper middle class\n9 60\n4\u20135\n2\u20133\n1\n40\n0\n20\n0\nA B C D D\nCasual Careful Reading Word Minimal\nspeech speech style lists pairs\nContextual style\nFigure 7.2 R-pronunciation in New York City by social class and style of speech\nSource: Labov (1966, p. 240)\nand pairs. This is the finding I mentioned in chapter 6. Labov calls this a cross-\nover in the graph and explains it as an instance of hypercorrection. Hypercorrec-\ntion occurs when individuals consciously try to speak like people they regard as\nsocially superior but actually go too far and overdo the particular linguistic\nbehavior they are attempting to match. Here, lower middle-class speakers know\nhow prestigious r-pronunciations are and, in reading word lists and lists of\npairs, i.e., when they are placed in situations which require them to monitor\ntheir speech closely, they out-perform their reference group, in this case the next\nhighest social class, the upper middle class.\nLabov makes much of this phenomenon of hypercorrection, particularlybecause\nit appears to relate to changes that are taking place in the language. However,\na word of caution is necessary (see earlier remarks on pp. 157\u20138). Such displays\nas we find in figure 7.2 are displays of group means. We have no information\nabout the amount of variance about the means so we cannot be sure how\ncomparable they are. We do know they are based on quite small numbers of\ninformants in each case. In addition, we cannot be sure that any two means\nwhich differ do so significantly in the statistical sense. The cross-over shown in\nAITC07 167 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM\nserocs\nxedni\nr 168 Some Findings and Issues\nfigure 7.2 could, theoretically at least, be the result of the way the data have\nbeen treated. However, the fact that it occurs for both word lists and pairs\nprovides us with some assurance of the correctness of Labov\u2019s claims.\n(If you need to be convinced that using group means drawn from small\ngroups can lead to claims that may not always be valid, consider what you\ncould possibly say about two groups, each of five subjects, who produced the\nfollowing scores on some test or other: scores of 30, 70, 75, 80, and 85 in the\none case and of 75, 76, 77, 78, and 79 in the other. The first group mean is 68\nand the second 77. It would be very dangerous indeed to make any claims about\noverall group behavior other than that the performance of the members of the\nsecond group appears to be more homogeneous, i.e., to contain less variance,\nthan the performance of members of the first.)\nLabov also investigated the (th) variable in New York City, focusing on the\npronunciation of the initial consonants in words like thing and three. There are\nthree possible variants: [t], [t\u03b8], and [\u03b8], the last being the standard pronuncia-\ntion, the first being the most nonstandard (something like ting and tree), and\nthe middle an intermediate variant. Labov shows the distribution of scores on\nwhat he calls the (th) index, our figure 7.3. The higher the index score, thegreater\nthe incidence of nonstandard usage in the particular style of speech. Labov\n(1972b, pp. 238\u201340) observes that in every context members of the speech\ncommunity are differentiated by the use of the variable, but nevertheless every\ngroup behaves in the same way, as indicated by the parallel slope of style-\nshifting. However, individuals are not consciously aware of this general pattern\nfor all groups because each individual is limited in his or her social contacts. The\nsame linguistic variable signals both social and stylistic stratification.\nFinally, what is impressive is the striking regularity of the overall pattern,\nwhich emerges from samples with as few as five individuals in any sub-group,\nusing no more than five or ten utterances in a given style for each individual.\nLabov adds that other variables show similar distributions, e.g., the (dh) vari-\nable in New York City, i.e., the pronunciation of the initial consonants in words\nlike this and then, and the distribution of the (ng) variable in a variety of\nstudies. He also adds that the (th) variable indicates that there is a sharp break\nin linguistic behavior between working-class groups and middle-class groups, as\nwe can see in figure 7.2. He calls a distribution with such a sharp break in the\npattern sharp stratification.\nDiscussion\n1. In both the United States and the United Kingdom it is possible to hear\npronunciations of words like cart and car with or without the r pronounced.\nHowever, r-pronunciation (or the lack of it) is differently valued on the two\nsides of the Atlantic. Explain some of the complexities, linguistic and social,\nof r-pronunciation in the two countries. Consider where r is found in the\ntwo countries, how rs are actually pronounced (and by whom), and also\nsuch pronunciations as Shah(r) of Iran, idea(r) of it, cah but car is, and the\ndifferent pronunciations of the r in very.

Labov\u2019s major study of New York City is based on a sample from the Lower\nEast Side.

Labov has been criticized for what some see as a simplistic approach to\nquantification. For example, Hudson (1996, p. 181) criticizes Labov\u2019s method\nof studying variation because:\nit loses too much information which may be important. Information about the\nuse of individual variants is lost when they are merged into variable scores,\nand information about the speech of individuals is also lost if these are\nincluded in group averages. At each stage the method imposes a structure on\nthe data which may be more rigid than was inherent in the data, and to that\nextent distorts the results \u2013 discrete boundaries are imposed on non-discrete\nAITC07 169 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM\nserocs\nxedni\n)ht( 170 Some Findings and Issues\nphonetic parameters, artificial orderings are used for variants which arerelated\nin more than one way, and speakers are assigned to discrete groups when they\nare actually related to each other in more complex ways.\n(See also Davis, 1983, pp. 97\u2013101.) How justified are such criticisms? For\nLabov\u2019s views, see Labov (1969, p. 731): \u2018We are not dealing here with\neffects which are so erratic or marginal that statistical tests are required to\ndetermine whether or not they might have been produced by chance.\u2019\n4. Hypercorrect linguistic behavior is not at all unusual. What examples do\nyou know of? Who gives evidence of such behavior, and on what occasions?\nNorwich and Reading\nTrudgill (1974) investigated sixteen different phonological variables in his work\nin Norwich, England. He demonstrates, in much the same way as Labov does\nin New York City, how use of the variants is related to social class and level of\nformality. Trudgill\u2019s analysis of the variables (ng), (t), and (h) shows, forexample,\nthat the higher the social class the more frequent is the use of the [\u00ba], [t], and\n[h] variants in words like singing, butter, and hammer rather than the cor-\nresponding [n], [?], and \u00d8 variants. However, whereas members of the lower\nworking class almost invariably say singin\u2019, they do not almost invariably say\n\u2019ammer. Moreover, although members of the lower working class say singin\u2019\nwhen they are asked to read a word list containing words ending in -ing, they\npronounce the (ng) with the [\u00ba] variant on the majority of occasions. The data\nalso suggest that, so far as the (ng) variable is concerned, its variant use is\nrelated not only to social class but also to gender, with females showing agreater\npreference for [\u00ba] than males, regardless of social-class membership.\nTrudgill (1995, pp. 93\u20134) uses data such as those in table 7.5 to demonstrate\ntwo very important points: first, when style is kept constant, the lower the social\nclass the greater the incidence of the nonstandard variant; second, when class is\nkept constant, the less formal the style the greater the incidence of the nonstand-\nard variant. The figures therefore increase in table 7.5 in every column from top\nto bottom and in every row from left to right. Some increases are negligible and\nsome are considerable. For example, middle middle-class speakers always avoid\n-in\u2019 pronunciations in the two most formal styles but \u2018relax\u2019 considerably more\nin casual style. Upper working-class speakers make a very sharp differentiation\nbetween the two reading styles and the two speaking styles. Lower working-\nclass speakers make no real distinction between the two speaking styles and\nuse -in\u2019 pronunciations almost exclusively in both; however, just like middle\nworking-class speakers, they are conscious that -ing pronunciations are used in\nreading styles and do manage to introduce them on many occasions.\nIn an investigation of linguistic variation in Reading, England, Cheshire (1978)\nfocused on the (s) variable in the speech of three groups of boys and girls. The\n(s) variable in this case is the extension of third-person singular verb marking\nto all other persons, e.g., I knows, you knows, we has, and they calls. The\nAITC07 170 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Some Findings and Issues 171\nTable 7.5 Percentage use of -in\u2019 in four contextual styles of speech in\nNorwich\nStyleb\nSocial classa WLS RPS FS CS\nMMC 0 0 3 28\nLMC 0 10 15 42\nUWC 5 15 74 87\nMWC 23 44 88 95\nLWC 29 66 98 100\na Social class: MMC (middle middle class), LMC (lower middle class), UWC (upper\nworking class), MWC (middle working class), LWC (lower working class).\nb Style: WLS (word list), RPS (reading passage), FS (formal), CS (casual).\nSource: based on Trudgill (1995, p. 94)\nsubjects were thirteen boys and twelve girls aged 9\u201317. They came from three\ngroups of friends: an all-male group (Orts Road boys), a small group of three\nboys (Shinfield boys), and an all-female group (Shinfield girls). Members of all\ngroups used nonstandard forms with verbs like know and call on just over half\nof the possible occasions for use. They used the nonstandard has, e.g., we hason\nabout a third of the possible occasions and the nonstandard does on just under\na quarter of the possible occasions for use. The situation with do and does is\ncomplicated by the fact that the nonstandard he do is slightly preferred over he\ndoes. With have, Cheshire found that the has form occurred only as a full verb\n(\u2018We has a muck around in there\u2019) or before an infinitive (\u2018I has to stop in\u2019) but\nnever as an auxiliary (so \u2018I have got,\u2019 not \u2018I has got\u2019).\nFurther investigation showed that, if a verb took a finite complement, i.e., if\nit was followed by a clause in which the verb is marked for tense, then there\nwas no use of this -s ending with persons other than third-person singular.\nConsequently, we find \u2018Oh, I forget what the place is called\u2019 and \u2018I suppose they\nwent to court\u2019 in contrast to \u2018I just lets her beat me\u2019 and \u2018I knows how to stick\nin the boot.\u2019 Moreover, \u2018vernacular\u2019 verbs, i.e., commonly used verbs, like go,\nkill, boot, and learn, were much more likely to take the -s ending in all forms\nthan other verbs, to the extent that use of goes, kills, boots, and learns is almost\nmandatory with such verbs. Cheshire calls these two conditions constraints on\nusage and points out that they work in opposite directions. Consequently, a verb\nstem always takes the -s when it is used in the third-person singular, the -s\nending is favored in all persons when the verb is a \u2018vernacular\u2019 verb, but the\n-s is not used at all if the verb has a complement in which the verb in the\ncomplement is marked for tense (Cheshire, 1978, p. 62).\nSome social factors operate, too, in the pattern of variation. Cheshire devised\nan index based on ambition, degree of \u2018toughness\u2019 (as indicated by such things\nas ability to fight and steal), and peer-group status in order to assess the strength\nof an individual\u2019s membership in the boys\u2019 vernacular culture. She found thathigh\nfrequencies of -s usage went with high index scores and low frequencies with\nAITC07 171 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 172 Some Findings and Issues\nlow index scores. Girls\u2019 vernacular culture had to be defined differently because\nthe girls had different interests from the boys. Girls used the -s ending as much\nas boys, but did not exhibit the same correlation between frequency of use and\nindex scores. They also shifted their use of the (s) variable toward Standard\nEnglish norms in formal situations to a greater extent than the boys. Cheshire\nconcluded (p. 68) that \u2018variation is controlled by both social and linguisticfactors.\nIn boys\u2019 speech, variation is governed by norms that are central to thevernacular\nculture, and are transmitted through the peer group. Variation in the girls\u2019speech\nappears to be a more personal process, and less rigidly controlled by vernacular\nnorms.\u2019 She added that both boys and girls \u2018are subject to two linguistic con-\nstraints on the form of regular present-tense verbs, of which one favours the use\nof the non-standard verb form, and the other favours the use of the standard\nform.\u2019 Nonstandard forms are not without their attraction; they are said to have\ncovert prestige in contrast to the obvious overt prestige of standard forms. They\nsignal that those who use them have no hesitation in identifying with the local\ncommunity through laying claim to local loyalties. Not for them the attractions\nof some other identity, which the use of standard forms might indicate.\nCheshire further observes that \u2018variation in the forms of have and do appears\nto be due to linguistic changes in progress.\u2019 In the next chapter I will have more\nto say on this last point and on how studies of variation have been used to\nindicate not just how much variation exists in a language, but also how such\nvariation can be interpreted to show changes that are occurring.\nDiscussion\n1. Table 7.6 is based on a similar table in Trudgill (1974, p. 94). The table\nshows us how his sixty subjects in Norwich performed on the (ng) variable.\nA score of 000 indicates exclusive use of [\u00ba] pronunciation, e.g., singing,\nwhereas a score of 100 indicates exclusive use of [n] pronunciations, e.g.,\nsingin\u2019. What kinds of conclusions might you be tempted to draw from this\nkind of display? How confident can you be about your conclusions?

The study showed that there is a very close relationship\nbetween the use of multiple negation and social class. Whereas upper middle-\nclass speakers used such negation on about 2 percent of possible occasions, the\ncorresponding percentages for the other three social classes were as follows:lower\nmiddle class, 11 percent; upper working class, 38 percent; and lower working\nclass, 70 percent. From such figures we can make a further observation: it is not\nthat members of the upper middle class always avoid multiple negation and\nmembers of the lower working class always employ it; it may be our impression\nthat such is the case, but the facts do not confirm that impression. No class uses\none variant of the variable to the exclusion of the other, regardless of circum-\nstances. Speech in any social class, therefore, is inherently variable, just as it is\nin society as a whole. However, the analyses of the different variables that\nwere investigated in Detroit clearly show that, although individuals exhibit a\ncertain amount of inconsistency in their linguistic behavior, there is nevertheless\na pattern to that behavior. For example, as the situation becomes more formal,\nan individual\u2019s linguistic usage comes closer to standard usage, and the higher\nthe social class of the speaker, the more standard too is the speaker\u2019s behavior.\nMoreover, children are less standard in their linguistic behavior than adults with\nsimilar social backgrounds, and males are less standard than females.\nWolfram\u2019s study was an attempt to show how the distribution of linguistic\nvariables correlated with such factors as social class, gender, age, and racial\norigin in Detroit. Wolfram wanted to identify varieties of speech which might\nbe associated with specific social groups in the city, e.g., upper middle-class\nAITC07 173 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 174 Some Findings and Issues\nTable 7.7 Informants used in Wolfram\u2019s (1969) study\nWhite Black\nSocial class Age Male Female Male Female\nUpper middle 10\u201312 2 2 2 2\n14\u201317 2 2 2 2\n30\u201355 2 2 2 2\nLower middle 10\u201312 2 2\n14\u201317 2 2\n30\u201335 2 2\nUpper working 10\u201312 2 2\n14\u201317 2 2\n30\u201335 2 2\nLower working 10\u201312 2 2\n14\u201317 2 2\n30\u201335 2 2\nwhites or lower working-class blacks. His work is based on data collected from\nforty-eight black subjects drawn from 702 subjects used initially in the Detroit\nstudy, plus another twelve white subjects. They were selected to conform as\nclosely as possible to the criteria shown in table 7.7.\nHaving identified his groups, Wolfram then attempted to show characteristic\ndifferences in linguistic behavior. He investigated four phonological variables:\nword final consonant cluster simplification; medial and final th, as in nothing\nand path; syllable final d; and the occurrence of r after vowels. He also invest-\nigated four grammatical variables: the zero copula, as in He tired; invariant\nbe, as in He be tired; the -s suffixes, as in girls, boy\u2019s, and goes; and multiple\nnegation. Figure 7.4, for example, shows group means for the absence of the\nthird-person singular tense-marking (z). A close inspection of the figure shows\nthat, whereas it is quite possible that the differences between the two groups at\neach of the ends, i.e., between the upper middle and the lower middle classes\nand between the upper working and the lower working classes, may not be sig-\nnificant, there being only twelve subjects in each group, the difference between\nthe top two groups as a whole and the bottom two groups as a whole, i.e.,\nbetween the middle class and the working class, almost certainly is, andprobably\nat a very high level of significance. There does therefore appear to be a greatdiffer-\nence in usage of the (z) between middle-class and working-class people inDetroit.\nWe can contrast this graph with another from the same study, this one con-\ncerned with (r) absence (Wolfram, 1969, p. 110). Figure 7.5 gives us the informa-\ntion we need. Here we find a progressive step-like set of differences. However,\nwithout statistical testing we cannot be sure that there is a significant difference\nbetween adjacent means, particularly when the groups are small (twelve sub-\njects) and the difference in means is of the order of 61.3 and 71.7 percent.

The data do, however, fall into a very clear pattern and it\nis such patterns that sociolinguists seek to explain.\nWolfram and Fasold (1974, pp. 80\u20131) argue that in the case of (r) absence in\nfigure 7.5 we have an example of what they call gradient stratification, i.e., a\nregular step-like progression in means which matches social groupings. In the\nprevious case of (z) we have sharp stratification, i.e., a clear break between a\nparticular pair of social groupings. The first kind of stratification is said to be\ntypical of the distribution of phonological variables; the second kind to be\ntypical of grammatical variables.\nWolfram\u2019s general findings in Detroit were that social status was the single\nmost important variable correlating with linguistic differences, with the clearest\nboundary being between the lower middle and upper working classes. In each\nclass, however, females used more standard-language forms than males. Older\nsubjects also used fewer stigmatized forms than did younger subjects. Finally,\nreading style showed the fewest deviations of all from standard-language forms.\nAITC07 175 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM\necnesba\n]z[\nfo\n% 176 Some Findings and Issues\n100\n80\n71.7\n61.3\n60\n40 38.8\n20.8\n20\n0\nUpper Lower Upper Lower\nmiddle middle working working\nSocial class\nFigure 7.5 Percentage of (r) absence in words like farm and car in Detroit black\nspeech\nSource: based on Wolfram (1969, p. 110)\nSo far I have mentioned several factors that correlate with linguistic variation:\nsocial class, age, and gender. Another study which looked at all of these is\nMacaulay\u2019s study (1977) of five variables in Glasgow: the vowels in words such\nas hit, school, hat, and now and the occurrence of glottal stops as replacements\nfor [t] in words like better and get. Macaulay surveyed sixteen adults, sixteen\n15-year-olds, and sixteen 10-year-olds, with equal numbers of males and females\nrepresented in each group. His forty-eight subjects were equally divided among\nfour social classes: professional and managerial; white-collar; skilled manual;\nand semi-skilled and unskilled manual. In the case of children, the occupation\nof the father was used unless the mother was (or had been) in a \u2018higher\u2019 occupa-\ntional group. Macaulay counted equal numbers of occurrences of each variable\nfrom each speaker as a further control for volubility.\nMacaulay found a clear correlation between variation and social class, but in\naddition he was able to make certain further interesting observations. He found\nhis two lowest classes to be much alike in behavior. With males, the greatest\ndifference between classes was between his top class (professional andmanagerial)\nand the second-highest class (white-collar), whereas with females the greatest\nAITC07 176 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM\necnesba\n]r[\nfo\n% Some Findings and Issues 177\ndifference was between the two intermediate classes (white-collar and skilled\nmanual). Increase in age also seemed to be associated with an increase in the\ndifference between social classes, this difference showing itself to be clearly\nestablished in the 15-year-olds surveyed (but apparent also in the 10-year-olds).\nFinally, Macaulay found that, when individual rather than group behavior was\nplotted for each variable, a continuum of behavior was exhibited in each case.\nThat is, there was considerable variation within each of the four classes, with\nthe behavior of certain individuals in each class overlapping the behavior of\nindividuals in neighboring classes; however, the means for most classes, except\nthe two lowest as noted above, were clearly different from each other.\nWe can conclude from Macaulay\u2019s study that the linguistic behavior of indi-\nviduals forms a continuum in the same way that social organization is continu-\nous. Social classes are constructs imposed on this continuum. If linguistic variation\nis correlated with the \u2018average\u2019 behavior of individuals in these classes, it will\nshow class differences. This is what we should expect, and it is what happens.\nHowever, the linguistic behavior of certain individuals in one class will overlapthe\nlinguistic behavior of certain individuals in neighboring classes. What is import-\nant in this view is that there is still a certain homogeneity of behavior withinthe\nclasses. The majority of speakers within the various classes behave like oneanother\neven though some individuals do not. This behavior has its own distinctive qual-\nity, and its characteristics are not just the result of some individuals behavinglike\nindividuals \u2018above\u2019 them and other individuals behaving like individuals \u2018below\u2019\nthem in the social hierarchy. That is, the members of each social class exhibit\ncertain ranges of behavior on the linguistic variables and, even though theranges\noverlap, each social class has a distinctive range for each variable.\nKiesling\u2019s research (1998) on the use of the (ng) variable among a small group\nof fraternity men at a university in the United States shows how it might be\npossible to account for individual differences in usage. He recorded conversa-\ntions in a variety of settings and found, predictably, that the use of -in\u2019 was\nclosely related to the type of activity: 75 percent in socializing, 53 percent in\ninterviews, 47 percent in meetings, and 54 percent in reading aloud. The big\ndifference here is between the first activity and the other three. Kiesling focused\non the two extremes, socializing and meetings, and was drawn to try to account\nfor the language behavior of three participants who diverged from the usual\npattern of decreasing their use of -in\u2019 as the social situation became more\nformal, i.e., the difference between casual socializing on the one hand and a\nformal meeting on the other. He concluded that each of the individuals achieved\na personal objective in using -in\u2019 so frequently: for \u2018Speed\u2019 the use of -in\u2019 sym-\nbolized, among other things, values such as hard work, practicality, and freedom\nas well as a certain rebelliousness and independence; for \u2018Waterson\u2019 its use was\nlikewise emblematic of hard work but was also an appeal to camaraderie and\na claim to shared physical power; for \u2018Mick\u2019 the use of -in\u2019 made the same claim\nto hard work but also served as an expression of authority and power. Kiesling\nsays that the (ng) variable is here being used to create identity. Although these\nmen are college students they look to working-class modes of behavior in order\nto express themselves as \u2018hard working,\u2019 \u2018rebellious,\u2019 \u2018casual,\u2019 or\u2018confrontational,\u2019\nand they do this through their language choices.\nAITC07 177 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 178 Some Findings and Issues\nTwo studies of the French spoken in Montreal are of interest because they\nsuggest some of the complexities we face in trying to describe the distribution\nof variants of a variable in one case and the persistence of a rare variant in\nanother. The first study is by Sankoff and Cedergren (1971), who report on the\n(l) variable in Montreal French, i.e., the presence or absence of [l] in expres-\nsions such as \u2018he does,\u2019 [il fy] or [i fy], and \u2018he is,\u2019 [il e] or [y e]. They found\nthat in 94 percent of the cases when the (l) was followed by a consonant or a\nglide it was not produced phonetically, but it went phonetically unrealized inonly\n57 percent of the cases when it was followed by a vowel. Therefore, before a\nconsonant or glide the (l) is generally not pronounced, but it is pronounced\nbefore vowels about two times out of five. However, there is a further con-\nstraint. When the (l) is part of an impersonal pronoun, e.g., the l in il pleut (\u2018it\u2019s\nraining\u2019) or il y a (\u2018there is\/are\u2019), that (l) is almost never realized before a\nconsonant or glide; in contrast, a personal il (\u2018he\u2019) in the same circumstances\nfinds the (l) not realized phonetically about 80 percent of the time. What we find\nhere is that the distribution of the variants of the (l) variable in Montreal French\nis related to both phonological and grammatical factors, not just social ones.\nThe (l) is affected by its relationship to the following phonological segment and\nwhether it occurs in either a personal or impersonal pronoun, when these are\neven of identical form, i.e., il.\nThe second example from Montreal French is Sankoff and Vincent\u2019s study\n(1977) of the use of the negative particle ne. They found that ne is very rarely\nused at all in Montreal; in fact, it is not used in about 99.5 percent of the cases\nin which it would be required in formal written French. This same deletion is\nalso found in Standard Continental French with estimates from Paris, where the\nphenomenon is also advanced, running between 25 and 86 percent for deletions.\nThe deletion phenomenon is even more advanced in Montreal, for among the\nsixty subjects whose speech was analyzed, the woman who deleted least still\nrealized only 8 percent of the nes required by \u2018standard\u2019 treatments of French.\nHowever, ne has not disappeared entirely from Montreal French. Its use is\ncharacteristic of a certain style or effect that speakers wish to achieve. Sankoff\nand Vincent observe (p. 303) that \u2018ne appears in contexts where speakers are\nmost likely to be aware of speech itself, and to be monitoring their own speech.\nThe topics of language, instruction, discipline, and religion tend to spirit people\nback to a normative world in which \u201cproper language\u201d becomes very salient.\u2019\nWhen speakers do use ne, they also tend to use other forms that are rare in\nMontreal French, e.g., nous instead of on as a subject; alors rather than donc\nor ca \u00b8 fait que as a conjunction; and nonreduced forms of elle and elles. Sankoff\nand Vincent claim that ne persists in Montreal French as a syntactic and stylistic\nresource which speakers can employ as they see fit. Although many linguists\nseem to believe that, when a linguistic change has progressed to the point that\nne deletion has progressed in Montreal, it is best to regard it as lost altogether,\nSankoff and Vincent do not agree, claiming that, even at its present extremely\nlow level of use in Montreal, ne still has a function to serve. It is still, therefore,\na variable feature of Montreal French. Today, when you learn French as a\nforeign language, you learn to use ne. You must use it in writing French.

For example, Hudson (1996, pp. 178\u201380) reports ona\nstudy (Jahangiri, 1980) of the pronunciation of certain words in TeheranPersian.\nIn such words, e.g., \/bekon\/\u2018Do!\u2019, the vowel in the first syllable varies between\n[e] and [o] as it assimilates to the second vowel, i.e., comes to resemble it in\npronunciation. In this study forty speakers, divided equally between males and\nfemales and assigned to groups on the basis of amount of education, produced\nthe individual percentages of assimilated vowels in casual speech shown in\ntable 7.8. In this table the average (i.e., mean) for each group is given as wellas\nthe measure of the amount of internal variation within each group, the standard\ndeviation. The latter indicates how homogeneous each group is. What is re-\nmarkable here is how little overlap there is between groups. There is no overlap\nwithin a particular gender grouping, so that all members of the university-\neducated male group use less assimilation than all members of the next group,\nthose with secondary education, and those, in turn, less than the men withprimary\neducation, and so on. The same situation is true of females. The figures show\noverlap between the genders, but even here the pattern is entirely consistent in\nthat males always overlap the next lowest group of females. That is, if vowel\nassimilation is dispreferred, being associated with low educational attainment,\nmales show the consequences of this just a little less than do females. Thedisplay\nin figure 7.6 reorganizes the data of table 7.8 to show this effect. In thefollowing\nchapter we will see that this situation is more complicated still becauseassimilation\ncan also be shown to depend on the actual word in question, so that although\nit may occur in \/bekon\/\u2018Do!\u2019 it need not necessarily occur in \/bebor\/\u2018Cut!\u2019\nAITC07 179 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 180 Some Findings and Issues\n100\n90\n82\n80\n73\n70\n71\n60\n57\n55\n50 48\n46\n41\n40\n30 29 33\n24\n20 18 21\n10\n6\n7\n5\n0\nF M F M F M F M\nUniversity Secondary Primary None\nGender and education\nFigure 7.6 Percentage of vowels assimilated in casual speech in Teheran Persian\nDiscussion\n1.

What might this suggest\nto you about the social structure of Glasgow, about the process of social-\nization there, and about the process of language acquisition?\n2. Evidence exists from studies of language behavior in various communities\nthat forms found in local and lower-class speech are used to signalsolidarity.\nAITC07 180 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM\nnoitalimissa\nlewov\nfo\n% Some Findings and Issues 181\nLabov\u2019s work in New York City and Trudgill\u2019s in Norwich, England, cer-\ntainly show this. But it has also been a common finding among such diverse\ngroups as speakers of Canadian French in Quebec, Lowland Scots, and\nCatalan in Spain, to cite but a few examples. In an era of languagestandard-\nization, which has the support of many public agencies and the mass media,\nthere is a remarkable persistence of both regional and lower-class speechused\nto demonstrate group solidarity and antipathy toward outside influences.\nWhat do you see as the implications, if any, of this phenomenon for public\neducation?\n3. Assuming you have learned Standard French \u2018by the book,\u2019 what kinds of\nunlearning would you have to undergo if you had as your goal \u2018speaking\nMontreal French like a native\u2019? What kinds of abilities would be involved\nin the \u2018unlearning\u2019 process?\n4. I have described the study of vowel assimilation in Teheran Persian as\nproducing results which \u2018verge on the amazing.\u2019 Look at table 7.8 and figure\n7.6 and make several predictions about how different speakers in Teheranwill\npronounce \/bekon\/ and what you can tell about the educational attainmentof\na speaker if you hear him or her pronounce \/bekon\/ a number of times.\nNote the kind of certainty claimed for these predictions. Does it seem to be\njustified? (You should note that Hudson (1996, p. 184) voices some caution\nabout these findings: \u2018the words and speakers were specially selected in\norder to illustrate this point as clearly as possible, and...the pattern for\nthe research as a whole...is much messier.\u2019 See also pp. 216\u201317.)\nBelfast\nThe Milroys took a rather different approach to variation in their study (Milroy\nand Milroy, 1978, and Milroy, 1980, 1987a) of certain aspects of speech in\nthree working-class areas in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Many studies conducted\nin Northern Ireland (and elsewhere) stress the importance of social networks.\nSuch networks, which originate in kinship ties, determine an individual\u2019s access\nto employment and to other resources. People develop close and continuing\nrelationships with each other, and they help one another, first their kin and then\ntheir co-religionists. Belfast has been called an assemblage of urban villages in\nwhich the inhabitants see a need for strong ties because of the external threats\nthey perceive to exist. Furthermore, in spite of other differences, Protestants and\nCatholics are alike in the importance they place on networks of relationships.\nThe Milroys were able to show how a stable set of linguistic norms emerges\nand maintains itself in a community. Lesley Milroy calls these vernacular norms,\nnorms which are \u2018perceived as symbolizing values of solidarity and reciprocity\nrather than status, and are not publicly codified or recognized\u2019 (1980, pp. 35\u2013\n6). These norms contrast with middle-class norms, the ones most of us would\nview as being characteristic of any wide social standard. Consequently, the\nMilroys looked at working-class speech in three stable inner-city working-class\nAITC07 181 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 182 Some Findings and Issues\ncommunities in Belfast: Ballymacarrett, in East Belfast, a Protestant area with\nlittle male unemployment (because of the stability provided by work in the local\nshipyard), close male relationships, and a sharp differentiation between men\u2019s\nand women\u2019s activities with men working within the area and women working\noutside; the Hammer, in West Belfast, also a Protestant area; and the Clonard,\nalso in West Belfast, a Catholic area. In both the Hammer and the Clonard there\nwas considerable male unemployment (about 35 percent), male relationships\nwere less close than in Ballymacarrett, and there was no sharp differentiation\nbetween men\u2019s and women\u2019s activities. Consequently, both the Hammer and the\nClonard exhibited less strong social networks within them than did Ballymacarrett,\nparticularly for males.\nThe Milroys used a modified participant-observer technique, i.e., Lesley Milroy\nbecame part of the system she studied, being introduced into it as \u2018a friend of\na friend,\u2019 and the analysis is based on data collected from forty-six working-\nclass speakers of both sexes with approximately one-third from eachcommunity.\nBeing interested in social networks, the Milroys tried to place each informant\non a six-point scale which characterized that person\u2019s participation in networks.\nAll speakers did so participate, because each of the communities exhibited a\npattern of dense and multiplex ties. As I indicated on p. 129, dense refers to the\nfact that many people share the same social contacts, and multiplex to the fact\nthat people are linked to one another in several ways simultaneously, e.g., as\nkin, neighbors, or fellow employees. The Milroys\u2019 six-point scale for scoring\nindividual network strength used the following factors: membership in a high-\ndensity, territorially based cluster; kinship in the immediate neighborhood;\nworking with at least two people of the same sex from the same area; and\nvoluntary leisure-time association with workmates.\nThe Milroys examined eight linguistic variables and found significant cor-\nrelations between network strength and linguistic usage on five of these, two at\np < .01 (i.e., there is less than one chance in a hundred that there is no such\nrelationship) and three at p < .05 (i.e., there is less than one chance in twenty\nthat there is no such relationship). The two strongest correlations were with\nthe vowel in words like hat, man, and grass (with the vowel being pronounced\nrather like that of father) and the deletion of the fricative th [\u00a8] in mother and\nbrother. The less strong correlations were with the vowel in words like pull,\nshove, and foot (with the vowel being pronounced rather like that of but and\nshut), and the vowel in either monosyllabic words like peck, bet, and went or\nin the accented syllables of polysyllabic words like acc\u00e9nt and s\u00e9cond.\nHowever, a closer inspection of the results by community showed that, withone\nexception, it was only in Ballymacarrett that there was a significant correlation\nbetween the variables and network strength. The greater the network strength,\nthe greater the incidence of the variants identified with the Belfast vernacular.\nThere was also in Ballymacarrett a significant difference between men and women\nin their use of the vernacular, with men showing a much greater incidence of\nvernacular usage. The two other communities showed no similar significant dif-\nferences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s usage, both ranking below those found in\nBallymacarrett, with one exception: young women in the Clonard seemed toprefer\ncertain vernacular variants and seem to be in the vanguard of extendingvernacular\nnorms into that sub-group.\nAITC07 182 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Some Findings and Issues 183\nWhat we see in these working-class communities in Belfast, then, is that the\nstronger the social network, the greater the use of certain linguistic features of\nthe vernacular. The results support Milroy\u2019s (1980, p. 43) hypothesis that \u2018a\ncloseknit network has the capacity to function as a norm enforcement mechan-\nism; there is no reason to suppose that linguistic norms are exempted from this\nprocess. Moreover, a closeknit network structure appears to be very common...in\nlow status communities.\u2019 She adds that \u2018the closeknit network may be seen as\nan important social mechanism of vernacular maintenance, capable of operating\neffectively in opposition to a publicly endorsed and status-oriented set of legitim-\nized linguistic norms.\u2019 Once again, we see how low-status varieties of a language\nmaintain themselves in the face of heavy competition from \u2018above\u2019: they enable\nthose who use them to show their solidarity with one another and achieve some\nkind of group identity.\nDiscussion\n1. Milroy (1987a) says: \u2018In modern urban society, large socially and geograph-\nically mobile sections of the population will lack the conditions necessary\nfor the formation and maintenance of reciprocity networks...individual\nmobility produces inequality of wants, as well as a collapse of wellestablished\nterritorial rights.\u2019 What limit does this statement suggest that there might be\nto the use of networks in the study of linguistic variation? How might you\ntry to make allowances for these?\n2. People use language to unify and band together. Try to find some common\nwords with variant pronunciations and attempt to show how individuals\nmay use these variants to identify themselves with others. Here are a few\nwords you might begin with: breathing, buoy, data, falcon, herb, kiln,\nmischievous, and relevant.\n3. Speakers have been observed to modify their speech to make it more like\nthat of their listeners (see Bell, 1984, and Trudgill, 1986, pp. 8\u20139). Can you\nfind some examples? How might this phenomenon of \u2018accommodation\u2019\ncomplicate work in sociolinguistics?\nControversies\nIn a previous section I noted that linguistic variables may show correlations not\nonly with social variables but also with other linguistic features, i.e., they may\nbe linguistically constrained too, as with the deletion of l in Montreal.

If we look closely at the\nenvironments of these stops, we will find that sometimes the stop is preceded by\na sonorant (a nasal or l) and sometimes by a non-sonorant (a stop or africative),\nand it is followed sometimes by a vowel and sometimes by a consonant (or\nnon-vowel). We can see this distribution more clearly in table 7.9. Wolfram\nand Fasold point out that the constraint of appearing before a non-vowel hasa\ngreater effect than the constraint of appearing after a sonorant, i.e., appearance\nof the stop before a non-vowel leads to a greater amount of deletion than\nappearance after a sonorant. When both constraints are present we find the\nhighest percentage of deletions: 83.3 percent in san(d) castle. When neither\nconstraint is present we have the least: 25.2 percent in lif(t) it. In the intermedi-\nate cases, appearing before a non-vowel is more important than appearing after\na sonorant. Wolfram and Fasold, therefore, call appearing before a non-vowel\na first-order constraint and appearing after a sonorant a second-order con-\nstraint. That is, the former exercises a greater influence on a person\u2019s linguistic\nbehavior than does the latter.\nConstraints may also mix phonological and grammatical features. Wolfram\n(1969, pp. 59\u201369) explains a situation in Detroit in which black speakers also\ndelete final stops in clusters, but in this case make a distinction according to\nthe grammatical function of the stop. In the final cluster in cold the d has no\nindependent grammatical function \u2013 it is part of a single unit of meaning \u2013 but\nin burned it marks past tense and is grammatically the -ed ending, and therefore\nhas its own meaning. The data are distributed as in table 7.10. In this variety\nof English the first-order constraint is once again appearance before a vowel or\nnon-vowel (here consonant). Appearance before a vowel inhibits cluster simpli-\nfication in all cases and appearance before a consonant encourages it. The\nsecond-order constraint is appearance as the -ed ending. That is, such appear-\nance has a lesser effect than whether or not the following sound is a vowel or\nconsonant. Consequently, the greatest loss of [d] in these examples occurs when\nthe following sound is a vowel and the [d] does not represent the -ed grammat-\nical ending. The least loss occurs when the [d] is followed by a vowel and it is\nthe -ed ending. This situation is the same for all social classes, but the actual\namounts of deletion vary from class to class.\nAITC07 184 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Some Findings and Issues 185\nTable 7.10 Final cluster simplification among black speakers in Detroit\nSocial class\nUpper Lower Upper Lower\nmiddle middle working working Example Environment\n0.07 0.13 0.24 0.34 burn(ed) up -ed, before vowel\n0.28 0.43 0.65 0.72 col(d) out not -ed, before vowel\n0.49 0.62 0.73 0.76 burn(ed) coal -ed, before consonant\n0.79 0.87 0.94 0.97 col(d) cuts not -ed, before consonant\nSource: based on Wolfram (1969, pp. 59\u201369)\nTable 7.11 Final cluster simplification among black youth in\nNew York City\nSimplification\n(%) Example Environment\n24 pass(ed) eleven -ed, before vowel\n59 pas(t) eleven not -ed, before vowel\n74 pass(ed) five -ed, before non-vowel\n91 pas(t) five not -ed, before non-vowel\nSource: based on Labov (1972b, p. 222)\nFurther study of this phenomenon by Labov (1972b, p. 222) showed that\ndifferent sub-groups in society may order two constraints differently. Among\nblack speakers in New York City, Labov found that, whereas more adolescent\ngroups order the above constraints in the way reported in table 7.10, upper\nworking-class adults reverse the order. With most adolescents the situation is as\nin table 7.11; however, with upper working-class adults we have the situation\nshown in table 7.12. In this example the first-order constraint is the status ofthe\n[t]: whether or not it represents the -ed ending; the second-order constraint is\nthe next phonological segment: whether or not it is a vowel. Whereasadolescents\nare inhibited in their simplification of final clusters, first by whether thefollowing\nsegment is a vowel and only then by the nature of the [t], adults are inhibited\nin their simplification first by the status of the [t], i.e., they are reluctant to omit\nit if it represents -ed, and only then by the presence of a following vowel.\nUsing information similar to the kind just presented, Wolfram and Fasold\n(1974, pp. 133\u20134) go on to show how it is possible to take a phenomenon like\ncluster simplification and predict certain kinds of linguistic behavior.

Labov has suggested that we should attempt to state what we know by\nwriting variable rules. A variable rule is a modified version of the kind of rule\nfound in grammars modeled on Chomsky\u2019s ideas. It recasts such a rule in the\nform of a statement that introduces probabilities: do this or that at a certain\nfrequency or frequencies according to the presence or absence of factors a, b,\nc,...n. Wolfram and Fasold (1974, p. 110) actually hypothesize that speakers\n\u2018can identify variable rules, which linguistic factors favor rule operation, the\nhierarchical order in which they are ranked, the extent to which higher-order\nconstraints are stronger than lower-order ones, and the probabilities toward rule\noperation contributed by each.\u2019\nIn practice we face considerable difficulties in trying to write even a single\nvariable rule. For example, what kind of rule could cover all instances of the\nvariable (h)? Some people nearly always say happen and after, while instances\nof \u2019appen are rare indeed. Others show considerable use of \u2019appen, and still\nothers never say anything but \u2019appen. None of these say hafter for after. Not a\nfew say \u2019appen and after, but occasionally some of these say happen and also\nhafter. That is, there are h-pronouncers, h-droppers, and h-inserters. Yet one\nvariable rule is supposed to cover all speakers; either that, or there are two\nvariable rules which interact. But this latter proposal would suggest that people\ncommunicate not through the same set of rules but through intersecting sets. It\nwould therefore raise still other issues.\nOne very serious criticism is that, while the concept of \u2018probability\u2019 is often\nuseful in life in explaining the chances of certain things happening, it offers no\nguide to conduct in specific instances. Categorical rules, i.e., rules which say \u2018if\nX then Y,\u2019 do offer a guide to, and therefore an explanation of, conduct, but\nvariable rules do not and cannot. They do no more than summarize general\ntrends, tendencies, or probabilities found within groups. Variable rules are stat-\nistical generalizations based on surveys of language use and they indicate trends\nor norms in populations.\nAdditional concerns have been voiced about the concept of \u2018variability\u2019 as\nsome kind of rule-governed behavior that can also be ascribed to individuals.\nWe must ask what kinds of mental processes would be necessary to handle that\nkind of statistical information and how children could acquire it during their\nlanguage learning (see Kay and McDaniel, 1979). More recently, Fasold (1991,\np. 9) has admitted that, \u2018Variable rules were proposed as a way of understanding\nhow variation works within a theory of human language.\u2019 He adds (p. 18) that\nin reality the variable rule \u2018was never any more than a display device.\u2019 In recent\nyears there has been throughout linguistics a general decline in rule-writing;\nsociolinguistics has seen much less of it too.\nBailey (1973) and Bickerton (1971) have been particularly critical of such\nattempts to use variable rules. They acknowledge variability in language but\nAITC07 187 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 188 Some Findings and Issues\ninsist that it can be explained if we look closely at the environments in which\nvariation occurs and are prepared to relate the environments to one another\nusing some kind of scale. We must note, of course, that they are concerned with\nindividual speech behavior, what they call the isolect, whereas Labov and others\nhave been concerned with group behavior, the sociolect, insisting that such\nbehavior is important in studies of how people actually use language not only\nto communicate verbally but for a variety of other purposes too.\nBailey and Bickerton have proposed that each individual controls an isolect\nof the language, an individual array of linguistic usages which others may ormay\nnot share. Each isolect is a lect. The lects of a language differ from one another\nalong a continuum, which forms a polylectal or panlectal grid such that there\nis an implicational relationship among the various lects: that is, if lect A has\nfeature X, then it will also have features Y and Z, but if lect B has feature Y\nbut not feature X, it will still have feature Z. Lect C may have only feature Z\nand it could not acquire feature X until it first acquired feature Y. As Petyt(1980,\np. 190) points out, if a Yorkshireman pronounces grass with the first vowel of\nfather [ap], he will pronounce cut with [\u00ce]. According to the theory, this\u2018dynamic\u2019\nview of language structure is valid both synchronically, i.e., as a description of\nthe structure of a language at any specific moment in its history, and diachronically,\ni.e., over an extended period of time. It is a new variation of the old wave theory\nof linguistic change, but one that incorporates synchronic matters.\nThe theory proposed by Bailey and Bickerton tries to reduce the amount of\nvariation in language that linguists must consider by requiring an investigator\nto look at individual lects and consider all linguistic behavior as categorical, i.e.,\nfully determined by this or that factor or set of factors. They claim that, when\nthe linguistic behavior of an individual is graphed for a particular linguistic\nvariable, that behavior is far more likely to show an \u2018all-or-none\u2019 characteristic,\ni.e., to be categorical in nature, than to show some kind of statistical distribu-\ntion around a mean, i.e., to be variable in nature, if the particular circumstances\nthat occasion the behavior are known. Individual lects may then be arranged on\nvarious continua that can be related implicationally to one another. At any\nmoment it should also be possible to say exactly what the status of any linguistic\nvariable is, i.e., how speakers are using it over a period of time, in regional or\nsocial space, and along various dimensions of the latter, i.e., according to social\nclass, age, gender, ethnicity, and so on. Such panlectal grammars therefore would\naccount for variation; moreover, Bailey and Bickerton suggest that much of the\nvariation that sociolinguists actually talk about is a creation of the methods they\nemploy, i.e., is a methodological artifact.\nBailey and Bickerton also appear to be making a claim which Labov does not\nmake. Their dynamic model suggests that all variation in language results from\nchanges in progress: variation is the mark of linguistic change. On the other\nhand, Labov does not regard every bit of linguistic variation as being associated\nwith changes in progress. While some variation is associated with changes in\nprogress, he regards variation as an inherent property of language, i.e., you\ncannot have language without variation but only part of that variation \u2018goes\nsomewhere,\u2019 i.e., results in change.\nAITC07 188 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Some Findings and Issues 189\nThe kinds of variation we have seen raise important issues about the very\nnature of language itself. Labov and others have argued that the kinds of gram-\nmars preferred by Chomsky and his associates must be modified to recognizevari-\nation and, particularly, that the famous (or notorious) competence\u2013performance\ndistinction (see pp. 2\u20133) made in such grammars must be reformulated, weak-\nened, or abandoned. Chomsky himself has never appeared to find much value\nin Labov\u2019s work: for him it is a study of linguistic performance and has very\nlittle to offer to a better understanding of language.\nThere is no denying, however, that recent studies employing the linguisticvari-\nable have added an important new dimension to our understanding of language.\nIt is now well documented that variation is a linguistic fact and that it is not\nhaphazard. Previously, dialect geographers had amply documented the differ-\nential but systematic distribution of linguistic forms, and the new techniques of\ninvestigation have revealed similar patterns that can be related to a variety of\nsocial and even linguistic factors. It is also apparent that people are aware,some-\ntimes consciously and sometimes not, that certain variants have more (or less)\nprestige than others. They are also able to modify their speech to reflect chang-\ning circumstances, and do so quite systematically.\nThe distribution of the variants of variables also seems to be clearly related\nto changes that languages undergo. No longer is it possible to separate synchronic\nand diachronic matters into two mutually exclusive domains; descriptive and\nhistorical matters are interrelated. Moreover, some findings, such as Labov\u2019s dis-\ncovery of the cross-over phenomenon, appear to indicate not only the direction\nof change but possibly also some of its motivation. We will turn our attention\nto some of these matters in the chapter that follows.\nDiscussion\n1. Try to devise a small-scale study focusing on the pronunciations of final\nclusters before words beginning with vowels and consonants andcontrolling\nfor the grammatical function of the final stop in the cluster, e.g., past five,\npassed five; past eleven, passed eleven. Try to collect data from subjectshaving\ndifferent social backgrounds and attempt to vary the formality of usage. Do\nyour results correspond in any way to those reported in this chapter?\n2. In comparison with sociologists, linguists who have studied linguistic\nvariation have used very simple ways of determining the social-class mem-\nbership of individuals. They have argued that more sophisticated approaches\nare hardly necessary since the results they have achieved have been \u2018very\nsatisfactory\u2019 (see Chambers and Trudgill, 1998, p. 49, and Chambers, 2003,\npp. 47\u201354). How justified is such a claim about their methodology in gen-\neral? In thinking through your answer, consider how linguists are inclinedto\ntreat specialists in other disciplines who treat linguistic data with a similar\nelementary approach.\n3. The rule that tells you to pronounce the t at the beginning of top with a\nlittle puff of air, as [th], is a categorical rule, as is the rule that tells you to\nAITC07 189 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM 190 Some Findings and Issues\npluralize man as men; such a rule always operates. The rule that allows you\nto pronounce the first vowel in either to resemble that in beet or in bite is\nan optional rule. However, the rule that allows you to say singing on one\noccasion and singin\u2019 on another is a variable rule. Try to clarify the concept\nof \u2018rule\u2019 in each case. Look for other kinds of behavior in which the same\nkinds of distinction can be made. Try to assess the compatibility of these\ndifferent notions of \u2018rule\u2019 within a single theory of behavior.\nFurther Reading\nThe journals Language in Society, Journal of Sociolinguistics, and Language\nVariation and Change often report studies conducted in this \u2018quantitative\u2019\ntradition.\nAITC07 190 5\/9\/05, 4:34 PM Change 191\n8 Change\nRecent work in sociolinguistics has raised once again a long-standing question:\ncan linguistic change be observed while it is actually occurring? In modern\nlinguistics the answer to that question has usually been a resounding negative.\nFollowing the example of two of the founders of the modern discipline, Saussure\n(1959) and Bloomfield (1933), most linguists have maintained that change itself\ncannot be observed; all that we can possibly hope to observe are theconsequences\nof change. The important consequences are those that make some kind of dif-\nference to the structure of a language. At any particular time, it certainly may\nbe possible for linguists to observe variation in language, but that variation is\nof little importance. Such variation must be ascribed either to dialect mixture,\nthat is, to a situation in which two or more systems have a degree of overlap,\nor to free variation, that is, to unprincipled or random variation. Linguists\ntherefore attached little or no theoretical importance to variation. Only in recent\ndecades have some of them seen in it a possible key to understanding how lan-\nguages change.\nThe Traditional View\nIn what I will call the traditional view of language change, the only changes that\nare important in a language are those that can be demonstrated to have struc-\ntural consequences. Consequently, over a period of time a distinction between\ntwo sounds may be lost in a language, as occurred historically in most varieties\nof English in the vowels of meet and meat or horse and hoarse. In most dialects\nthese vowels have fallen together (or coalesced). Alternatively, a distinction may\nbe gained where there was none before, as in a house with an [s] but to house\nwith a [z], or finally in thin and thing, the [n] and [\u00ba]. In each of these cases\na single phonological unit became two: there was a structural split. So we can\nfind instances of phonemic coalescence, situations in which a contrast existed at\none time but later was lost, and instances of phonemic split, situations in which\nthere was no contrast at one time but a contrast developed. According to thisview\nof change, that is all we can really say because it is structural considerations\nalone that are all-important (i.e., do units A and B contrast or do they not?).\nAITC08 191 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 192 Change\nVariation is either controlled by circumstances, e.g., allophonic (as when the pin\npin is aspirated but the p in spin is not), or it is free, i.e., random. Internal\nchange in a language is observed through its consequences.\nSuch change, of course, is not restricted to phonology. The morphology andsyn-\ntax of a language change in the same way. It is possible, therefore, to writeinternal\nhistories of languages showing the structural changes that have occurred over\nperiods of time through use of this principle of \u2018contrast vs. lack of contrast.\u2019\nA second kind of change in a language is external in nature. This is change\nbrought about through borrowing. Changes that occur through borrowing from\nother dialects or languages are often quite clearly distinguishable, for a while at\nleast, from changes that come about internally. They may be somewhat idiosyn-\ncratic in their characteristics or distribution and appear, for a while at least, to\nbe quite \u2018marked\u2019 in this way, e.g., the schl and schm beginnings of Schlitz and\nschmuck, or Jeanne with the J pronounced like zh. There are often good socialor\ncultural reasons for borrowing, and the items that are borrowed are usuallywords\nused to describe \u2018exotic\u2019 objects, e.g., pajamas, tea, perfume, and kangaroo, or\nlearned or scientific words.\nSpeakers of different languages may have different views about borrowing.\nEnglish speakers borrow almost indiscriminately from other languages, but\nspeakers of French, German, Modern Hebrew, and Icelandic are far more dis-\ncriminating. Speakers of Hindi, cultivated ones at least, look to Sanskrit for\nborrowings, and speakers of Urdu look to Arabic. As we will see in the follow-\ning section, there is also some borrowing \u2013 or spread, at least \u2013 of phonological\nand grammatical items through certain areas, but this phenomenon is much\nmore limited \u2013 and undoubtedly much harder to explain \u2013 than the borrowing\nof words to describe objects.\nOf these two kinds of change, internal and external, linguists view the former\nas being far more important even though it is the latter that is inclined to come\nto public attention, as when efforts are made to \u2018purify\u2019 languages. People tend\nto react to the consequences of external change by complaining about \u2018falling\nlanguage standards,\u2019 resisting new usages, and trying to constrain variation. The\ntraditional linguistic approach to change has not been very helpful when con-\ntroversies have arisen. An approach which says that it is languages that change\nand not speakers that change languages has little to contribute to a better public\nawareness of what is happening. As we will see too, it may also be an unreward-\ning approach to take.\nThe traditional view of language change also favors a \u2018family tree\u2019 account of\nchange and of the relationships among languages. Linguists tend to reconstruct\nthe histories of related languages or varieties of a language in such a way that\nsharp differentiations are made between those languages or varieties, so that\nat one point in time one thing (that is, a language itself, or a variety, or even\na specific linguistic item) splits into two or more, or is lost. More rarely, there\nis coalescence. The alternative \u2018wave\u2019 account of change and relationships is\nmuch less easy to work with. In this approach the various changes that occur\nmust be seen as flowing into and interacting with one another. It is not at all\neasy to reconcile the need to find contrasts with the desire to maintain a certain\nAITC08 192 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 193\nfluidity in boundaries. A variant of this latter view of change is that particular\nchanges diffuse throughout a language, sometimes in rather idiosyncratic ways.\nOne extreme version of this last view is the claim that \u2018each word has its own\nhistory,\u2019 a claim that would seem to reduce historical linguistics to etymology,\nthe science of tracing the origins of individual words.\nIt is in the last view of change, through use of the concepts of \u2018wave\u2019 and\n\u2018diffusion,\u2019 that we see the possibilities that the study of variation opens up tous\nfor understanding the process of change. The \u2018family tree\u2019 view focuses on the\nconsequences of change and, particularly, on internal change. But if we believe\nthat languages are changing all the time \u2013 and all linguists do hold that belief\n\u2013 we should also be able to see change in progress if we can recognize it. If we\ncan interpret the variation we see, or some of it at least, as a wave of change\ngoing through a language, and if we can see changes apparently diffusing through\nsets of similar linguistic items, we may also want to recast or even abandon the\ntraditional Saussurean and Bloomfieldian view of language. To do so, however,\nwe will have to be sure that what we are observing is change and not just\nrandom fluctuation. That will be our major concern in the rest of this chapter.\nDiscussion\n1. The English language has changed considerably during its history, as even\na cursory glance at the language of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Chaucer,\nShakespeare, and T. S. Eliot will confirm. But you might look at a few\ndetails to get an indication of some precise changes. For example, why do\nwe say cat and cats but wife and wives and goose and geese? Why do we\nhave voiced sounds at the beginning of this, then, and there but voiceless\nones at the beginning of thin, through, and think? How alive is the subjunct-\nive in Modern English? What did the following words once mean: cunning,\nstench, earl, meat, doctor, lord, and lady? From which languages have we\nborrowed the following words: tea, biology, sauerkraut, pajamas, perfume,\nsputnik, muskrat, blitz, and aria? What can you say about changes in the\nrelative and personal pronouns since the time when the beginning of the\nLord\u2019s prayer was translated as \u2018Our Father, which art in Heaven, Hallowed\nbe Thy name\u2019?\n2. Much recent attention has been focused on the adverb hopefully, particu-\nlarly on its \u2018misuse\u2019 in sentences such as Hopefully, he won\u2019t succeed. Try\nto find out what is happening here. Is this a small linguistic change in\nprogress? You will have to look at similar adverbs (e.g., personally, inter-\nestingly, confidentially), at the function that hopefully has in the overall\npattern of adverb use, and at the possibility that people select items to\nstigmatize somewhat arbitrarily (see Crystal, 1984, and Wardhaugh, 1999).\n3. Are you aware of any special pronunciations or other linguistic usageswhich\nseem to be \u2018creeping in\u2019 to the language? If you are, are they approved or\ndisapproved? Does that approval (or disapproval) depend at all on who is\nusing the linguistic item in question?\nAITC08 193 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 194 Change\n(beg) caught\nbag\/(hat) hot\/(cot)\nFigure 8.1 Northern Cities Shift\nChanges in Progress\nBefore discussing changes in language, we must distinguish between variation\nand change for not all variation is a sign of, or leads to, change. There is what\nLabov (2001, p. 85) calls \u2018long-term stable variation,\u2019 e.g., the distribution of\nthe (ng), (th), and (dh) variables previously discussed and such alternatives as\nthe ask\u2013aks alternation, the latter as old as the language. Schools sometimes\ndevote considerable time and effort \u2013 very often wasted \u2013 in attempts toeradicate\nnonstandard variants of stable variables (see Wolfram and Schilling-Estes, 1998,\nfor a list of examples from American English). Socio-economic class, age, and\ngender in that order appear to be the factors that affect the distributions of these\nvariables and they continue to operate over long periods of time. Labov adds\nthat his work in Philadelphia showed that the \u2018primary determinant of the stable\nsociolinguistic variables is...social class: the higher the position of a speaker\nin the social scale, the smaller...the frequency of nonstandard forms\u2019 (p. 112).\nHowever, Dubois and Horvath (1999, p. 298) warn that their work among\nCajuns in Louisiana showed that a \u2018set of variables cannot be prejudged to be\nstable sociolinguistic variables because they happen to be stable in the English\nlanguage as a whole or even in a surrounding dialect.\u2019 What appears to be an\ninstance of a stable linguistic variable may actually be a local innovation.\nIn contrast, change has a direction, being both progressive and linear. For\nexample, the Great Vowel Shift in English took centuries and is still incomplete,\nand the Northern Cities Shift (NCS) in the United States has lasted several\ngenerations and shows no sign of weakening (see Gordon, 2002, pp. 254\u201364).\nThis last change is a vowel change found in cities settled in a westward move-\nment of people from New York State, and centered in places such as Buffalo,\nDetroit, Chicago, and spreading to smaller urban centers. A major part of it\ninvolves a chain shift in vowels apparently set in motion by the raising of the\nvowel in words like bag to resemble the vowel in beg. The vowel in hot fronts\nto resemble the vowel in hat and the vowel in caught lowers to resemble the\nvowel in cot, as in figure 8.1. The NCS proceeds in a very narrow band as it\nmoves east to west. While its effects are apparent in Detroit, Windsor in Canada\nacross the river is unaffected. Likewise, barely thirty miles to the west ofDetroit,\nYpsilanti is also largely unaffected because of its large population of migrants\nfrom Appalachia. The resultant \u2018tight Appalachian social network in Ypsilanti\nAITC08 194 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 195\nserves as an inhibitor to adopting features of the NCS\u2019 (Evans, 2004, p. 162).\nNot participating in the NCS appears to be potent identity marker in each case.\nLabov points out that language change can be readily observed today: \u2018In\nspite of the expansion and homogenization of the mass media, linguistic change\nis proceeding at a rapid rate...so that the dialects of Boston, New York,\nChicago, Birmingham, and Los Angeles are more different from each other than\nthey were a century ago\u2019 (p. xii). The problem therefore is one of identifying\nchanges that are occurring and then of trying to account for them: what sets\nthem in motion; how they spread; and how they are maintained. These issues\nhave been his concern in his two most recent books (1994, 2001).\nVarious linguists have observed and reported on what they consider to be\nchanges in progress. For example, Chambers and Trudgill (1998, pp. 170\u20135)\ndescribe the spread of uvular r in western and northern Europe. All thelanguages\nof this part of the world once had either an apical (i.e., tongue-tip), trilled, or\nflap r, but from the seventeenth century on a uvular r spread from Paris to\nreplace these other varieties. This new r crossed language boundaries, so that it\nis now standard in French, German, and Danish, and is also found in many\nvarieties of Dutch, Swedish, and Norwegian. It did not cross the Channel into\nEngland, nor has it penetrated into Spain or Italy. What you find, though, when\nyou plot the progress of uvular r, is the importance of cities in its spread. Uvular\nr seems to be adopted initially by city dwellers, e.g., residents of Bergen and\nKristiansand in Norway, The Hague in the Netherlands, Cologne and Berlin in\nGermany, and Copenhagen in Denmark, and then the new use diffuses out-\nwards. Therefore, the strong internal links in the uvular r area are those between\ncities, which form a kind of network. Apparently, uvular r spreads from city to\ncity and later into the countryside surrounding each city.\nAnother phonetician, Gimson (1962, pp. 83\u20135) observed that in mid-twentieth-\ncentury Received Pronunciation (RP) the first part of the diphthong in a word\nlike home was tending to become increasingly centralized and the whole diph-\nthong itself monophthongized. He found such pronunciations mainly among\nthe younger members of fairly exclusive upper-class social groups, but they also\nappeared in less exclusive varieties of RP, e.g., in the variety favored by BBC\nannouncers of that era. Numerous observers of late twentieth-century speech in\nEngland (see particularly Foulkes and Docherty, 1999, 2000) have pointed out\nthe spread of such pronunciations as dwink for drink, be\u2019er for better, bruvver\nfor brother, and \u2019appy for happy. Such pronunciations apparently originated in\nsoutheast England among younger non-RP speakers but are now found in most\nurban areas and across a wide spectrum of social groups. Bailey (1973, p. 19)\nhas pointed out that in the western United States the distinction between the\nvowels in such pairs of words as naughty and knotty, caught and cot, and Dawn\nand Don is disappearing. For many young speakers the vowel distinction is\nalmost entirely gone, so that even hawk and hock are homophonous on many\noccasions. For older speakers, there may be complete loss of the vowel distinc-\ntion before t followed by a vowel, but there is less likely to be such loss before\na word final t or n, and most such speakers still preserve it in the hawk\u2013hock\npair, i.e., before the velar k. There is good reason to believe that this merger is\nnow widespread in North America.\nAITC08 195 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 196 Change\nZeller (1997) has described a sound change apparently now in progress in and\naround Milwaukee, Wisconsin: many speakers pronounce words like haggle and\nbag to rhyme with Hegel and beg, and bank like benk. This is another instance\nof the NCS. Zeller\u2019s investigation showed how it is both age- and gender-related.\nThe younger speakers she recorded, both male and female, have shiftedcompletely\nand have lost the vowel contrast in such words. Older males and females are\nalso participating in the change with older females leading so that older males\nare more likely to retain the vowel contrast than older females. The evidence\nstrongly suggests a change in progress: the loss of a contrast in these vowels\nbefore a voiced velar stop or nasal.\nAll the above are instances of a change diffusing through space. (See Britain,\n2002, for a general discussion.) Density of population and the influence of large\npopulation centers appear to be important factors. This gravity model of diffu-\nsion holds that large, culturally important cities influence smaller cities they\ndominate and eventually changes filter down to surrounding rural areas through\neven smaller towns and communities. A change may even spread directly from\none city to another leapfrogging, as it were, for a while at least, smaller inter-\nvening communities. The actual scale may vary, for it is the relative densities of\nthe various places that are important not their absolute size, i.e., city > town >\nvillage, with later filling of gaps. For example, Britain (pp. 612\u201316) describes\nhow in the Fens of England such a model explains the diffusion pattern in an\narea in which there are only two towns, King\u2019s Lynn and Wisbech, with\npopulations over 20,000 and only fourteen miles apart. These towns influence\nthe areas that surround them because of the road, rail, and waterway infrastucture\nand the social services they provide to rural residents. There is actually a dialect\ndivide between the two areas because there are still physical barriers to prevent\nspatial diffusion.\nA physical barrier such as a river or a range of hills can prevent diffusion. (Of\ncourse, a river can also become an axis for diffusion.) National boundaries may\nalso act as barriers. The NCS meets a national boundary in Detroit; it does not\ncross the river to Windsor in Canada. Boberg (2000) has shown that so far as\nvowel systems are concerned, \u2018Windsor is just as Canadian as Toronto\u2019 (p. 13).\nChambers (2003) points to one very interesting consequence of a national bor-\nder as a barrier to diffusion. He reports that even though children in southern\nOntario (and Toronto) may call the final letter of the alphabet \u2018zee\u2019 for a while\n(influenced no doubt by pre-school television broadcasts originating in the United\nStates), they give up this pronunciation for \u2018zed\u2019 by the time they reach adult-\nhood and this \u2018declining use of \u201czee\u201d as people grow older repeats itself in\nsucceeding generations\u2019 (p. 207). A triumph of Canadian identity over gravity!\nIn some of the examples just cited the factor of age seems to be important:\nyounger speakers are observed to use the language differently from olderspeakers.\nWe might consider such differential use as offering us the key we seek if we\nwant to understand how languages change. But, as we will see, age differences\nof this kind may be quite misleading. We must be sure that something we view\nas linguistic change because older people say one thing and younger people say\nsomething else is not just the phenomenon of age-grading, of using speech\nappropriate to your age group. How can we be sure that in each of the examples\nAITC08 196 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 197\ngiven above the younger people will not change their linguistic ways as they get\nolder, with those changes being in the direction of the use of the groups which\nare presently described as being older? The just cited use of \u2018zee\u2013zed\u2019 in Canada\nis clearly an instance of age-grading. There are at least two ways of answering\nthat question. The first way is to survey the same younger people twenty to\nthirty years later when they become middle-aged to see if they maintain the\ninnovations and really stay quite unlike the present older people; this would be\na panel study. If there was no change in behavior we could be sure that we had\neliminated age-grading as an explanation. The second way is to survey carefully\nchosen samples drawn from the same population at periods of twenty to thirty\nyears to see if comparable groups have changed their behavior; this would be\na trend study. As Eckert (1997, p. 153) says:\nCommunity studies of variation frequently show that increasing age correlates with\nincreasing conservatism in speech. With just the evidence from apparent time, it is\nambiguous whether the language patterns of the community are changing over the\nyears or whether the speakers are becoming more conservative with age \u2013 or both.\nWithout evidence in real time, there is no way of establishing whether or not age-\nstratified patterns of variation actually reflect change in progress.\n(See also Bailey et al., 1991, Chambers 2003, pp. 212\u201325, Chambers and Trudgill,\n1998, pp. 149\u201351, and Labov, 1994, pp. 76\u20137, for various points of view on\nthese issues.)\nOne study which was able to make use of roughly comparable sets of data\nfrom two periods of time is Labov\u2019s study (1963) of certain sound changes\nin progress on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. In this work Labov found that the survey\nconducted for the Linguistic Atlas of New England thirty to forty years before\nprovided him with rich sources of data about the phenomena in which he was\ninterested. The data collection methods of the two surveys, the Linguistic Atlas\nsurvey and Labov\u2019s, differed, but it was possible for Labov to make allowances\nfor these differences in order to achieve the necessary measure of comparability.\nAlthough Labov would have preferred to have worked with sound recordings,\nthat possibility did not exist. (However, it does now for future work.)\nMartha\u2019s Vineyard is a small island lying three miles off the coast of Massa-\nchusetts. At the time of Labov\u2019s investigation it had a small permanentpopulation\nof about 6,000 people, but each summer many more thousands came to stay for\nvarying periods of time. Most of the permanent residents lived in the easternpart\nof the island, the Down-island part, but this area was also the one most favored\nby the summer visitors. The western part of the island, the Up-island part, was\nstill quite rural with its center Chilmark. The permanent population consisted\nof Yankees, Portuguese, and native peoples (i.e., Amerindians). The Yankees\nwere descendants of early settlers; the Portuguese were fairly recent newcomers\nin comparison with the Yankees but had been on the island for several genera-\ntions; the native peoples, who lived on a remote headland, Gay Head, were\ndescended from the original occupants of the island.\nLabov concentrated his attention on the way native Vineyarders pronounced\nthe vowels in the two sets of words: out, house, and trout and while, pie, and\nAITC08 197 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 198 Change\nTable 8.1 Degree of centralization of (ay) and (aw) by age level on\nMartha\u2019s Vineyard\nAge (ay) (aw)\n75+ 25 22\n61\u201375 35 37\n46\u201360 62 44\n31\u201345 81 88\n14\u201330 37 46\nSource: Labov (1972b, p. 22)\nnight. He observed that the first parts of the diphthongs in such words were\nbeing centered: [a\u00e4] to [v\u00e4] and [ai] to [vi], with that centering more noticeable\nin the first set of words than in the second. He called the variable in the first\nset the (aw) variable ([a\u00e4] or [v\u00e4]) and the variable in the second set the (ay)\nvariable ([ai] or [vi]). He set out to collect a large quantity of (aw)s and (ay)s\nto find out who used the variants of each. He plotted his findings from his sixty-\nnine natives of Martha\u2019s Vineyard on various graphs to examine the relation-\nships between the degree of centralization and such factors as age, ethnicity,\noccupation, and place of residence. The survey conducted in the 1930s for the\nLinguistic Atlas of New England provided Labov with data for the earlier lin-\nguistic situation on the island.\nBy age level, Labov (1972b, p. 22) found the distribution of the centralized\nvariants shown in table 8.1. This table shows that centralization is most obvious\nin the 31\u201345 age group. The change was also a little more advanced in those\nof Yankee descent than among those in the other two groups with which Labov\nwas concerned, but not by much. It was more advanced among those who made\na living from fishing than among those who worked in occupations andbusinesses\nserving the summer visitors. It was also much more typical of Up-island speech,\nparticularly around Chilmark, the center of the fishing industry, than Down-\nisland speech, as table 8.2 shows. The change was therefore most advanced inpeople\nin their thirties and early forties who were fishermen living in the Up-islandarea.\nThe explanation that Labov offers is that the change was merely an exaggera-\ntion of an existing tendency to centralize the first part of the diphthong. This\nexaggeration is particularly characteristic of those who identified most closelywith\nthe island. At the time of the survey for the Linguistic Atlas, it appeared that\nthis centralizing tendency was being eliminated. It was virtually extinct in (aw)\nand in only moderate use in (ay). What had happened apparently was that,\ninstead of eliminating the tendency, residents exaggerated it to show their solid-\narity and their difference from the summer population. The more you identified\nwith the island, the more you centralized the first part of the diphthong. As\nLabov says (1972b, p. 36): \u2018When a man says [rvit] or [hvus], he isunconsciously\nestablishing the fact that he belongs to the island: that he is one of the nativesto\nwhom the island really belongs.\u2019 As further evidence of this fact, Labov divided\nAITC08 198 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 199\nTable 8.2 Geographical distribution of centralization on Martha\u2019s Vineyard\n(ay) (aw)\nDown-island 35 33\nEdgartown 48 55\nOak Bluffs 33 10\nVineyard Haven 24 33\nUp-island 61 66\nOak Bluffs 71 99\nN.

He found a very striking relationship between\nsuch feelings and centralization (p. 39), as shown in table 8.3.\nIf we go back to the original distinction by age, which showed the 31\u201345 age\ngroup in the vanguard of this change, we can see that it is they who had most\nto gain by identifying with the island. Many of the young were still ambivalent\nin their feeling: some wanted to leave (and were not inclined to centralize) and\nsome wanted to stay (and did centralize). The very old followed older ways,\nwhich did not involve as much centralization. But a person between 31 and 45\nwas likely to have had to come to terms with life quite recently. That coming\nto terms quite often meant staying on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and showing that\ncommitment by exaggerating centralization, even to the extent of pushing cen-\ntralizing in (aw) to surpass that in (ay). There was also some evidence that those\nwho had been to the mainland and had returned to the island to live were\namong the strongest centralizers. Centralization indicated \u2018Islander\u2019 status and\nlocal loyalty and solidarity. It had also been fixed on by the Portuguese and\nnative peoples, but in their case as marking some kind of equality with the\nAITC08 199 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 200 Change\nYankees. Here we can quite clearly see the social motivation of a sound change;\nin this case, the change is one motivated by a desire to show loyalty to a\nparticular place and solidarity with the people who live there.\nBlake and Josey (2003) replicated Labov\u2019s study forty years later and, in\ndoing so, took \u2018into account recent methodological and theoretical develop-\nments, both acoustic and social, that have been incorporated into sociophonetic\nstudies\u2019 (p. 452): specifically, they measured formant frequencies and used the\nVARBRUL statistical package. They found that Martha\u2019s Vineyard had become\nan even more popular recreational destination so that the locals had become\nalmost entirely dependent on tourism. Fishing had declined in importance. As\nthey became wealthier, the locals no longer sought to separate themselves from\ntourists and \/ay\/ lost its earlier meaning as a local social identifier. Locals are\nnow willing to sound just like tourists.\nA situation similar to the one Labov found in Martha\u2019s Vineyard in the 1960s\nexists still on Ocracoke Island off the coast of North Carolina (Wolfram, 1997,\npp. 116\u201317, Wolfram and Schilling-Estes, 1995, 1997). In this case a local\n\u2018poker game network\u2019 consisting of a small, indigenous group of men who meet\ntwice a week to play poker project their \u2018island\u2019 identity by employing largely\nsymbolic choices such as hoi toide for high tide, words like dingbatter \u2018outsider\u2019\nand mommuck \u2018to annoy,\u2019 and expressions like She was a-fishing. Not all is-\nlanders behave in this way. Middle-aged men, particularly those who socialize\ntogether on a daily basis, provide strongest evidence of this island \u2018brogue.\u2019\nTheir wives, the young, and even the old are less frequent users of these dialect\nfeatures. Change is occurring and the dialect is being lost, but those with strong\nisland identity resist the encroachment of the outside world by emphasizing use\nof the traditional \u2018brogue.\u2019 They mark themselves off in this way from tourists\nand all other outsiders. The difference here though is that these speakers cling\nto traditional speech ways, sometimes even exaggerated, in order to resist changes\nbeing introduced from outside the older island community.\nOne goal of Labov\u2019s work on the (r) variable in the speech of New York\nCity was to achieve some understanding of sound change there. Labov (1994,\npp. 86\u201394) tells how in 1986 Fowler replicated Labov\u2019s earlier study in three\nstores (actually substituting May\u2019s for S. Klein since S. Klein had gone out of\nbusiness). Fowler\u2019s trend study revealed that the stratification of the (r) variable\nwas stable. The figures for r-use were actually somewhat higher in 1986, indi-\ncating that a real change was occurring and could be shown in all classes, age\ngroups, and styles. Labov concludes (p. 91) that, \u2018Under the pressure of the new\nr-pronouncing norm, New York City speech is changing slowly.\u2019 His earlier\nstudy had led him to conclude that lower middle-class speakers cross-over, i.e.,\nbehave hypercorrectly, so far as the use of r is concerned. That is, they tend to\n\u2018over-produce\u2019 r sounds when they try to emulate what they perceive to be the\nkinds of pronunciation favored by those they aspire to equal. Within this lower\nmiddle-class behavior it is also the middle-aged who are at the leading edge of\nthis hypercorrective behavior with women rather than men in the vanguard.Labov\nhad expected that such hypercorrect behavior would hasten the process of sound\nchange. Fowler\u2019s findings, however, lead him to conclude (1994, p. 91) that,\n\u2018Contrary to what I originally expected, the hypercorrect behavior of the lower\nAITC08 200 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 201\nmiddle class, reflected in the pattern of Macy\u2019s employees, has not resulted in\nany sudden advance of r-pronunciation as a whole.\u2019\nLabov (1981, p. 185) points out that, when found, such behavior is a char-\nacteristic of the second-highest status group in a society. It is found in that group\nwhen its members adopt a formal style, and it is also found when they self-\nreport their linguistic usage, and respond to subjective reaction tests that require\nthem to evaluate their own and others\u2019 linguistic usages. Such tests seem to tap\nwhat speakers believe are the norms that operate in society. Moreover, women\nusually out-perform men in their tendency to adopt or support \u2018correct\u2019 behavior;\naccording to Labov, they do this because, in relation to men, \u2018women are con-\nsidered a second highest status group.\u2019\nAs we have observed, r-pronunciation has always been present to some extent\nin New York City speech. What has happened in New York City recently is that\nfor various reasons r-pronunciation in words like farm and car has become pres-\ntigious (or, alternatively, that pronunciation of such words without the r has\nbecome stigmatized). New Yorkers often try to abandon stigmatized features,\nfor New York speech is often considered to be a \u2018sink of negative prestige,\u2019 not\njust by outsiders but also by those who live there. There has therefore been a\nrecent re-evaluation of r-pronunciation along the eastern seaboard of the United\nStates; whereas in England it is r-less pronunciation which is in the ascendancy,\nin the United States it is the r-full variety that is on the increase. What is\nimportant is that it is the women of a particular social class who seem to be in\nthe vanguard of change so far as r is concerned in New York City. In this case,\nthe change seems to be motivated by a desire to be like those who have higher\nsocial prestige.\nTrudgill\u2019s (1972) work in Norwich, England, also shows certain changes in\nprogress. For example, Trudgill found that the distribution of the variants of the\n(ng) variable showed that there were very marked differences between the usage\nof working-class males and working-class females: males favored the [n] variant\n(i.e., pronunciations such as singin\u2019 rather than singing) much more than did\nfemales. He found similar results with other variables, with women showing\nmuch stronger preferences for standard forms than men.\nTrudgill offers (pp. 182\u20133) several possible explanations for women usingforms\nassociated with the prestige standard more frequently than men. He suggests\nthat women may be more status-conscious because they are less secure and have\nless well-developed social networks than men. Their social position is usually\ninferior to men and they are usually subordinate to them. Men are also judged\nby what they do, whereas women are rated on how they appear, and animportant\npart of that appearance is their speech. Women have a much greater need to use\nlanguage to signal their social status than do men. Another important factor in\nthis differential usage is that working-class speech has connotations of \u2018mascu-\nlinity\u2019 and women often want to dissociate themselves from it for that reason,\npreferring types of speech which are regarded as more refined. Consequently,\nTrudgill devoted a considerable part of his research effort to investigating\nworking-class speech and what he calls the \u2018hidden values associated with\nnon-standard speech [which may be] particularly important in explaining thesex\ndifferentiation of linguistic variables\u2019 (p. 183).\nAITC08 201 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 202 Change\nTable 8.4 Percentages of informants overreporting and underreporting\nvariants in Norwich\n(er) (o\u00af) (a\u00af)\nTotal Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female\nOverreport 43 22 68 18 12 25 32 22 43\nUnderreport 33 50 14 36 54 18 15 28 0\nAccurate 23 28 18 45 34 57 53 50 57\nSource: based on Trudgill (1972, p. 187)\nTrudgill employed a self-evaluation test to find out what residents of Norwich\nthought about speech in the city. He asked his informants whether or not they\nused certain pronunciations and compared the responses they gave him with the\nactual pronunciations that his informants used. He reports on three variables:\n(er) as in ear, here, idea; (4) as in road, nose, moan; and (1) as in gate, face,\nname. His findings are shown in table 8.4. In that table \u2018overreporting\u2019 refers\nto informants claiming to use a prestige variant more often than they areactually\nobserved to use it; \u2018underreporting\u2019 is, of course, the opposite. The percentages\nshow that for two of the variables, (er) and (1), speakers in Norwich overreport\ntheir usage; they underreport (4). However, although the percentages differ for\neach variable, in all three cases men tend to underreport and women tend to\noverreport their usages. A further analysis showed that both middle-class and\nworking-class speakers produced very much the same levels of under- and over-\nreporting, so the phenomenon appears to be gender-linked rather than social-\nclass-linked. The same kinds of results appeared when people were asked tomake\njudgments about two pronunciations of better ([bytv] or [by?v]); in this case\nwomen showed a stronger preference than men for the standard pronunciation.\nTrudgill maintains that linguistic changes in a direction away from the stand-\nard norms are led by men from the upper working class and middle working\nclass, at least in Norwich. In the working class, too, young females aged 10\u201329\nunderreported their use in some cases, particularly on the (4) variable. His\ngeneral conclusion, therefore, is that nonstandard working-class speech formsare\nhighly valued by males, and by females under 30, but these values are expressed\ncovertly rather than overtly; that is, people may tell you they do one thing but\nthey actually do something else. Trudgill emphasizes that, though it may becorrect\nthat in certain communities middle-aged middle-class women and the young are\nin the forefront of change toward the standard norm, \u2018in Norwich, at least,\nthere appears to be a considerable number of young WC [working-class] men\nmarching resolutely in the other direction\u2019 (p. 194). They find a certain \u2018covert\nprestige,\u2019 their own form of solidarity, in such behavior. (For somewhat similar\nbehavior among young people in Japan, see Haig, 1991.)\nA further instance of younger women behaving like men in their use of\nnonstandard linguistic forms comes from Chambers and Trudgill (1998, p. 86).\nAITC08 202 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 203\nThey report on a piece of research carried out in Trondheim, Norway. In\nNorwegian it is nonstandard usage to stress loan words on the first syllable\nrather than on the last (i.e., to use \u00e1vis rather than av\u00eds, \u2018newspaper\u2019); this use\nof stress is associated with lower-class behavior. However, whereas Trondheim\nmen of all ages instance approximately two-thirds nonstandard usages of such\nwords, the percentages of such usages in Trondheim women vary directly with\nage: women over 63 use less than 10 percent; between 37 and 62 about 25 percent;\nand younger women almost 60 percent, a percentage not significantly different,\nit would appear, from men of the same \u2013 or of any \u2013 age. These figures do not\nunequivocally indicate that there is a change in progress, for it is quite possible\nthat the women\u2019s linguistic behavior is age-graded, i.e., a behavior that changes\nwith age. But certainly young women, in Trondheim at least, have a different\nattitude from older women toward such linguistic behavior. It remains to beseen\nif that attitude will change, that is, if the behavior is age-graded, or if it stays\nunchanged, and is therefore indicative of a linguistic change in progress.\nTrudgill (1995, pp. 77\u20139) notes an interesting case which, on the surface at\nleast, goes counter to the principle that, in a social setting of the kindexemplified\nby Norwich, women generally lead the way in changes toward the standard and\nmen tend to march in the opposite direction. He observes that working-class\nmen exhibit higher scores than working-class women in the use of RP-likevowels\nin words like top, hot, and dog. He points out that in Norwich it is middle-\nclass women who usually introduce RP vowels. The vowel being introduced\nby the men is actually not an RP vowel, but one from the neighboring area of\nSuffolk and used there in working-class speech. It happens to have the same\nquality as the RP vowel but is introduced as a working-class solidarity marker\nand not at all in imitation of RP. As a working-class solidarity marker, it is not\nvery acceptable to working-class women, who prefer the unrounded non-RP\nlocal vowel, so appearing to be less receptive to the RP vowel than they actually\nare.\nWe must accept Trudgill\u2019s explanation cautiously. He presents only rawpercent-\nages of use in support of his claim and the actual differences are small. Forexample,\nthe different percentages of usage of the standard vowel in the lower workingclass\nare 20 percent for men and 17 percent for women and in the middle workingclass\nthey are 30 percent for men and 29 percent for women. Even in the upperworking\nclass the differences are only 56 percent for men and 32 percent for women.\nThere is certainly an \u2018interesting\u2019 difference here, but not a conclusive one.\nTrudgill (1988) reports on a follow-up in 1983 of his earlier study ofvariation\nin Norwich. He replicated his original study as far as he could with seventeen\nadditional informants born between 1958 and 1973 and therefore aged between\n10 and 25 in 1983. This follow-up study showed that certain changes he had\nnoted earlier had progressed: the vowels in beer and bear had merged entirely;\ngate and face were pronounced with [\u00e6i] rather than [e:]; a new variety of r had\nemerged; and words like thin and fin were no longer always distinguished, both\nbeing pronounced like fin by about 30 percent of younger people. Trudgill also\nreports (1986, pp. 35\u20137) that only children born in Norwich with parents who\nwere also born in Norwich produce a particular local distinction between the\nvowels of moan and mown. This learning constraint is extremely difficult to\nAITC08 203 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 204 Change\nexplain; it is also one that seriously restricts the \u2018heritability\u2019 of this particular\ndistinction.\nYoung people are sometimes found to speak somewhat differently from their\nparents and the surrounding community. Williams and Kerswill (1999), for\nexample, investigated the speech of preadolescent children in Milton Keynes,\na fast-growing new town in England within easy reach of London, Oxford,\nCambridge, Coventry, and Leicester. The town has a young, mobile population\ndrawn mainly from southeast England, is socially fluid, and lacks close net-\nworks. Children born in Milton Keynes speak neither like their parents nor like\npeople from the surrounding area. Their speech provides strong evidence for\ndialect leveling as they produce distinctive local forms that tend towardstandard\npronunciation but at the same time show the influence of the fairly widespread\nyouth culture of southeast England. While it is not clear how lasting suchchanges\nwill be, they do clearly serve to differentiate the young in Milton Keynes from\nall others.\nCheshire\u2019s (1978) finding in Reading, England, that lower-class boys use more\nnonstandard syntax than lower-class girls, further supports the thesis that change\nmay be motivated by a desire for identity and solidarity. The \u2018tougher\u2019 the boy,\nthe more nonstandard his use of the -s ending on verbs in the present tense. Boys\nwho were not regarded as tough produced a lesser incidence of suchnonstandard\nuse. With girls, the more conformist to middle-class values, the lesser theincidence\nof -s endings where they are not found in Standard English. What Reading boys\nappear to have done is take a particular nonstandard usage in their language,\none that actually has a long history in the local dialect but a history whichshows\nthat it is being replaced by the usage found in Standard English, and make it\ninto a solidarity marker.\nWe might actually argue that what we see here is not so much a change in\nprogress but an unconscious resistance to a change being brought in fromStandard\nEnglish. Lacking real-time data, that is, evidence concerning the samephenomenon\ngathered at two distinct points in time, we cannot be absolutely sure that we are\nseeing no more than the latter. Cheshire herself acknowledges such a possibility,\nbeing prepared to go no further than to say (p. 58) that: \u2018Patterns of variation\nin the forms of the present tense have and do show that variation in the use of\nthese forms may reflect on-going linguistic changes in the morphology of the\nverbs.\u2019 She adds that whatever change has occurred, it has apparentlyprogressed\nfurther with have than with do.\nEven if some groups march in the opposite direction or fight rearguardactions,\nthere seems to be a consensus among investigators that linguistic change often\nseems to originate in the lower middle class, with women in the vanguard of\nsuch change. This is the social group that tries to emulate its \u2018betters.\u2019 In addi-\ntion, because of their roles as mothers and sometimes as teachers, women in this\ngroup tend to have an influence far beyond their numbers. However, there is\na strong countervailing force: the nonstandard speech of lower-class males hasits\nown appeal to many men and sometimes even to young women. We cannotignore\nthis factor of solidarity. It is also apparent in Milroy\u2019s account (1980, 1987a)\nof how the vernacular is maintained in Belfast, where the stronger the network,\nthe greater is the influence of the vernacular, and the weaker the network, the\nAITC08 204 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 205\ngreater the influence of outside factors, especially non-working-class norms.\nWhat is especially interesting is that in the working class it is apparently males\nof all ages and sometimes young females who choose solidarity, whereas older\nfemales opt often for prestige.\n\u2018Linguistic marketplace\u2019 forces may also be at work here: what do individuals\nwant and what will they accept or reject linguistically to satisfy these wants? As\nthe introduction to Bourdieu (1991) says:\nLinguistic utterances or expressions are always produced in particular contexts or\nmarkets, and the properties of these markets endow linguistic products with \u2018value.\u2019\nOn a given linguistic market, some products are valued more highly than others;\nand part of the practical competence of speakers is to know how, and to be able,\nto produce expressions which are highly valued on the markets concerned.\nThe linguistic marketplace refers to how language is used in the give-and-take\nof social interaction. Language is not just a neutral medium of exchange; its uses\ntake on symbolic value. Some uses are highly valued and others are lowly\nvalued. These values are assigned through the various power relationships that\nexist. RP in England had (and may still have) a high symbolic value. Standard\nEnglish is more highly valued than nonstandard varieties. High language forms\nare valued highly in diglossic situations and low language forms are valued not\nat all. Traditionally, male language uses have been valued more highly than\nfemale language uses. (There are many other such marketplaces that we are\ninvolved in as humans, e.g., accommodations, dress, food and drink preferences\nchoices of entertainment, and so on.) As we will see in chapter 14, proponents\nof critical discourse analysis question the legitimacy of the power relationships\nthat exist in all of the above.\nLabov (1981, p. 184) makes an interesting observation about the role that\nwomen play in linguistic change. He points out that, whenever there is stratifica-\ntion by style and class in linguistic usage, you can also expect differences\nbetween men and women, with women showing higher values for preferred\nvariants than men, that is, a preference for forms that have more prestige in\nsociety. He adds the following corollary: \u2018[it is] important to bear in mind that\nthis shift of women toward higher prestige forms...is limited to those societies\nwhere women play a role in public life.\u2019 He adds that studies in Teheran and\nIndia showed a reverse tendency. Apparently, then, if a woman\u2019s status is fixed\nunalterably, she has no motivation to change linguistically; only in a society in\nwhich status can be changed does the necessary motivation exist. Returning to\nthe just mentioned concept of the \u2018linguistic marketplace,\u2019 we can say that in\nsuch cases there are simply no market pressures to change so the status quo is\nmaintained.\nWe can actually see what happens when traditions change in a society and\nwomen begin to take a more assertive role in what goes on. For example, in a\nstudy of how the inhabitants of Oberwart, a Hungarian enclave in Austria since\n1921, are shifting from a pattern of stable bilingualism in German and Hungar-\nian to the sole use of German, Gal (1978, 1979) showed how young women are\nin the forefront of the change there. As Oberwart, about 100 kilometres south\nAITC08 205 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 206 Change\nof Vienna, grew from a village of 600 to a town of over 5,000 inhabitants, the\nindigenous bilingual population decreased as a fraction to about a quarter of the\ntotal, and many of these, at least until recently, were peasant farmers. German\nhas become the language of social opportunity and social status, and it is the\nyoung women from the bilingual community who have shown most willingness\nto participate in social change. Hungarian is symbolic of peasant status, and\nmost young people do not want to be peasants. Young bilinguals want to pass\nas monolingual Germans, and children of mixed marriages \u2013 in this case, of a\nbilingual parent and a monolingual German-speaking parent \u2013 do not learn to\nspeak Hungarian.\nAn analysis of language use in Oberwart shows that Hungarian is most likely\nto be used by older people in networks involving many peasant contacts. As the\nnumber of peasant contacts decreases and the participants become younger, the\namount of German used increases. German is now used in more situations in\nwhich Hungarian was once used, and it is also used more and more, even by\nolder bilinguals. Young men with strong peasant networks still use Hungarian\na great deal, but young women with similar strong peasant networks useGerman\neven within these networks. They reject the use of Hungarian, for it is a clear\nindicator of peasant status in the community. Young peasant women also prefer\nnot to marry peasant men. They prefer non-peasant, German-speaking workers\nas spouses. But the effect of this is to force the bilingual peasant men also to\nmarry German-speaking peasant women from neighboring villages. Theoffspring\nof both kinds of marriage are German-speaking children. However, it is the\nyoung women\u2019s desire to participate in the social change that is occurring in\nOberwart and seek the higher status which the use of German alone seems to\noffer that is hastening the change from bilingualism to monolingualism in the\ncommunity.\nIn a similar study involving a Spanish community, Holmquist (1985) describes\nhow women show preferences for a standard variety of a language rather than\na nonstandard one and for marital partners who speak that standard variety. In\nUcieda, a small village near Santander in Spain, the women opt for prestigious\nCastilian pronunciations and look for men who use them as possible husbands.\nConsequently, local men cannot find women in the village to marry and must\nlook for Castilian-speaking wives. Both kinds of marriage erode the Uciedan\ndialect.\nWhat we have seen in all of the above studies are attempts made to isolate\nthe kinds of changes that appear to be occurring in specific places. A close\nexamination of the social context of each change also reveals the particular\nsegment of the community which is most involved in that change and possible\nmotivation for the involvement. These motivations can be various: to try to be\nlike a \u2018higher\u2019 social group or less like a \u2018lower\u2019 one; to mark yourself off from\n\u2018outsiders\u2019; to achieve a feeling of \u2018solidarity\u2019 with others; or to react to the pres-\nsures of the \u2018linguistic marketplace.\u2019 Women may be more active participants\nthan men in some changes, but the situation may be reversed in others.Although\nthe young are usually in the vanguard of most changes, in some it is the not-\nso-young who lead. In the next section we will look more closely at the issue\nof motivation and the actual process of change.\nAITC08 206 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 207\nTable 8.5 Differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s speech\nUMC LMC UWC LWC\nPercentage of multiple negation\nin Detroit speech\nMale 6.3 32.4 40.0 90.1\nFemale 0.0 1.4 35.6 58.9\nPercentage of non-prevocalic \/r\/\nin Detroit Negro speech\nMale 66.7 52.5 20.0 25.0\nFemale 90.0 70.0 44.2 31.7\nPercentage of -in\u2019 forms\nin Norwich speech\nMale 4 27 81 100\nFemale 0 3 68 97\nSource: based on Trudgill (1995, pp. 69\u201370)\nDiscussion\n1.

For a very different view of the pronunciation of final -ing, see Mathisen\n(1999), who reports on the incidence of the actual pronunciation of the final\ng in Sandwell, West Midlands. Young women are leaders but this time in\nthe pronunciation of a nonstandard form with local prestige status. Are\nsuch pronunciations of final gs likely to survive the twenty-first century?\n3. Individuals who shift from one geographic area to another or who are\nupwardly mobile (or both) often provide striking evidence of change in\nprogress. Can you apply any of the observations made in this chapter to\naccount for the changing linguistic usage of any such individual who is\nfamiliar to you? Can we learn anything about linguistic change in general\nfrom looking at individuals in this way?\n4. What consequences, if any, might recent emphases on equality between men\nand women have for linguistic change? This is necessarily a speculative\nquestion, but, in that it asks you to address the issue that certain linguistic\nchanges arise from social differences, it has wider implications than gender\ndifferences alone.\n5. Much of the language instruction provided in schools attended by working-\nclass children is directed toward changing aspects of the language that these\nchildren bring with them to school. Most teachers of young children are\nwomen, many of them of lower middle- and upper working-class origin. Do\nyou see any potential for conflict here? How might you deal with suchconflict?\nAITC08 207 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 208 Change\nThe Process of Change\nIn an early study of linguistic change in Kannada, a language of the Indian\nsub-continent, Bright (1960) examined the Brahman and non-Brahman caste\ndialects, which originate from the same historical source, Old Kannada, and,\nthough mutually intelligible, exhibit both obvious differences and some of the\nsame historical changes. His examination revealed that the Brahman dialect\nseems to have undergone unconscious change, that is, changes in phonology and\nmorphology. Bright hypothesizes that, although \u2018conscious\u2019 linguistic change\noriginates among members of the higher social strata, \u2018unconscious\u2019 change is\nnatural in all strata where the literacy factor does not intervene. He looks to the\ninteraction between social dialects for an understanding of linguistic change. He\nsuggests that the upper classes appear to originate sound change at the phonetic\nlevel and that, in their chase to imitate such phonetic changes, the lower classes\nbring about change at the phonemic level, that is, changes which eventually have\nstructural consequences for the language. In other words, we might say thatchange\nis somehow initiated at the highest social levels but carried through at the lower\nlevels. As we will see, this explanation is a partial one at the best. Such a viewof\nlinguistic change is too simple to account for all the situations we have encoun-\ntered. However, it might be the case that this is indeed what happens when the\nsocial distribution of the variants is caste-based rather than class-based.\nLabov (1981) has pointed out how difficult it is to get the right kinds of\ndata on which to base claims about linguistic change in progress and how easy\nit is to make either false claims or incorrect predictions, giving several instances\nof the latter from Switzerland, Paris, and Philadelphia (pp. 177\u20138). He stresses\nthe importance of having good data on which to base claims. Such data can\ncome from studies of a community conducted at different times. However, it is\noften the case that only a single study is done and the different responses of\nvarious age groups are compared and conclusions drawn about changes. Such\nstudies are apparent-time studies and require real-time confirmation. Since lin-\nguistic usage tends to vary according to the age of the individual, such age-\ngrading must also be taken into account, as we saw, for example, on p. 196 with\nreference to Canadian uses of \u2018zee\u2019 and \u2018zed\u2019. Hibya (1996) showed how real-\ntime data can confirm apparent-time data. He was interested in the denasalization\nof the velar nasal stop in Tokyo Japanese, i.e., the use of [g] for [\u00ba]. Figure 8.2\nshows how he was able to plot this use in 1986 to the left of the vertical broken\nline by year of birth for informants. There is an almost completely lineardecrease\nin such use from older speakers to younger ones. But is the loss age-graded?\nHibya also had recordings made thirty to forty years earlier of speakers aged\nbetween 60 and 80 at that time. Their usage is shown to the right of the vertical\nbroken line: virtually 100 percent use of [\u00ba]. Since in 1986 60- to 80-year-old\nspeakers used [\u00ba] between 10 and 40 percent of the time, the change to [g] is\nconfirmed as a real change.\nLabov insists that the best studies of change in progress look for different\nkinds of data sources, are very much concerned with assessing the accuracy of\nAITC08 208 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 209\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110\nAge in 1986\nFigure 8.2 Age and use of [g] in Tokyo\nSource: based on Hibya (1996)\nthese sources, and are quite cautious in the claims they make. However, he adds\nthat careful surveys of the current state of affairs also enable \u2018a good deal of the\npast [to] be reconstructed from the present if we look into the matter deeply\nenough\u2019 (p. 196). That is, the relationship between diachronic (historical) mat-\nters and synchronic (descriptive) ones is a two-way relationship. There is what\nLabov calls a \u2018dynamic dimension\u2019 to synchronic structure, so that the past helps\nto explain the present and the present helps to explain the past.\nAfter conducting a number of investigations of sound changes in progress,\nLabov (1972b, pp. 178\u201380) suggests that there are two basic kinds of change:\nchange from below, i.e., change from below conscious awareness, and changefrom\nabove, i.e., change brought about consciously. Change from below is systematic,\nunconscious change, whereas change from above is sporadic, conscious, and\ninvolves issues of prestige. Since change from above is conscious change, we\nmight expect such change to involve a movement toward standard linguistic\nnorms. Change from above may not actually be initiated within the highest\nsocial group in society. This group is a kind of reference group to groups lower\ndown in the social scale, and it is among these groups, particularly slightly lower\nones, that such change begins. Change from below is unconscious and away\nfrom existing norms. Some observers believe that in societies such as ours women\nmay be in the vanguard of the first kind of change and men in the vanguard of\nthe second, because women and men have different motives. In this view, women\nare motivated to conform to, and cooperate with, those who are socially more\nAITC08 209 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM\n]g[\nfo\n% 210 Change\npowerful whereas men are more inclined to seek solidarity with peers. Women,\ntherefore, consciously look \u2018up,\u2019 whereas men do not, preferring instead, though\nthey may not be conscious of it, the solidarity they find in the \u2018masculinity\u2019 and\n\u2018toughness\u2019 of peers and even of those they regard as being \u2018below\u2019 them in\nsociety. However, recent work by Labov in Philadelphia (2001) would suggest\nthat such a view is much too simplistic.\nIt is Labov\u2019s view (1994, p. 23) that \u2018cities have always been at the center of\nlinguistic innovation.\u2019 He decided, therefore, to examine the situation in Phila-\ndelphia to see if he could further clarify how and where change begins. He chose\nPhiladelphia because \u2018it appeared that almost all of the Philadelphia vowels were\nin motion\u2019 (1980, pp. 254\u20135). He was particularly interested in the fronting and\nraising of (aw) in words like out and down, the fronting and raising of (ey) in\nchecked syllables in words like made and pain, and the centralization of (ay)\nbefore voiceless consonants in words like right and fight. Labov\u2019s data camefrom\na telephone survey of the whole city together with intensive network studies of\nthe speech behavior of thirty-six individuals in a few selected neighborhoods. He\nfound that \u2018the speakers who are most advanced in the sound changes are those\nwith the highest status in their local community...[have] the largest number of\nlocal contacts within the neighborhood, yet...[have] the highest proportion of\ntheir acquaintances outside the neighborhood\u2019 (p. 261). In Philadelphia the\nleaders in change were upper working-class women, and men lagged by a gen-\neration. He concluded (p. 262):\nThe identification of the innovators of these sound changes allows us to rule out\nsome of the explanations that have been offered in the past for the phenomenon\nof sound change. Their advanced social position and the high esteem they hold in\nthe local community rule out the traditional charge of careless ignorance of the\nnorms of society. Their reputation as vigorous and effective users of the language,\ncombined with the nature of the vowel shifts themselves, makes any discussion of\nthe principle of least effort beside the point. The central position that they hold in\nlocal networks of communication gives new life to the principle of local density,\nthough we cannot project any discontinuity between these speakers and the expo-\nnents of the upper middle-class standard that they are leaving behind in their\ndevelopment of local sound changes. Once we are willing to refine our notion of\nprestige to give full weight to the local prestige associated with the Philadelphia\ndialect...we must be ready to recognize that such a local prestige, which appears\nprimarily in behavior and rarely in overt reactions, is powerful enough to reverse\nthe normal flow of influence, and allow the local patterns to move upward to the\nupper middle class and even to the upper class.\nLabov\u2019s general conclusion (2001) is that the changes that occur essentially arise\nfrom the nonconformity of certain upwardly mobile individuals who influence\nothers to adopt their behavior, thus affecting the behavior of the wider commu-\nnity. He adds that his conclusions are valid only for Philadelphia and then only\nfor the speech of non-blacks there. Blacks do not use this vowel system at all,\npreferring instead that of African American Vernacular English (AAVE).According\nto Labov, the non-black vowel system in Philadelphia gains much of its vitality\nfrom recent immigration to the city, with an accompanying renewed emphasis\nAITC08 210 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 211\non local identification and assertion of local rights and privileges, together with\na resistance to allowing the large black population to have its share of oppor-\ntunities in the city. He suggests that the future direction of change in the vowel\nsystem in Philadelphia will depend very much on social changes that are occur-\nring in the city.\nFurther work in Philadelphia led Labov and Harris (1986, p. 20) to conclude\nthat:\nThe Philadelphia speech community is separating into two distinct speech commu-\nnities: white and black. They share a large part of the general English language,\nand a number of local words as well....But the number of differences between\nthem in grammar and pronunciation seems to be growing steadily greater.\nIn particular they note black speakers\u2019 preference for -s as a \u2018mark of the\nnarrative past,\u2019 a feature that white speakers lack entirely. (I will have more to\nsay about this possible divergence of AAVE on pp. 344\u20135.)\nThe Milroys (Milroy, 1992, and Milroy and Milroy, 1992) are two other\nlinguists who are interested in how change begins. For them the key lies in\nnetwork ties: with strong ties change is slow but weak ties can lead to rapidchange.\nNew forms are adopted by innovators with weak ties to more than one group.\nSome of these innovations are taken up by core members of the groups. Change\nresults. Milroy and Milroy (1992, p. 9) say that \u2018groups linked internally mainly\nby relatively weak ties are susceptible to innovation\u2019 and add that \u2018innovations\nbetween groups are generally transmitted by means of weak rather than strong\nnetwork ties (e.g., through casual acquaintances rather than kin, close friends,\nor workmates).\u2019 They point out (p. 17) that their conclusion that change begins\ntherefore in the middle of the social-class hierarchy \u2018is entirely consistent with\nLabov\u2019s finding that innovating groups are located centrally in the class struc-\nture, characterized by him as upper-working or lower-middle class....For in\nBritish and American society at least, close-knit, territorially based, kin-oriented\nnetworks are located most clearly in the lowest classes, but upper-class networks\nare in some respects structurally similar, being relatively dense.\u2019 Marshall\u2019s work\n(2004) in northeast Scotland also showed that the most revealing factor in\ndetermining how individuals changed their speech behavior was the group to\nwhich they oriented: \u2018Those with the most positive orientation to the local rural\ngroup resist change.\u2019 He adds that those \u2018who have a higher degree of mental\nurbanisation, or an attitude of openness to supra-local norms,...are at the\nforefront of change\u2019 (p. 217).\nMany observers have noted the weakening of network ties as social and\ngeographic mobility increased in the late twentieth century. Social contacts in-\ncreased but became shallower. One consequence for language has been the fairly\nrapid spread of innovation. Some, like slang, are ephemeral. Others, like accent\nchange, produce more lasting effects. In England the old regional dialects have\nbeen much affected. Local varieties adopted linguistic features from influential\ncenters often with women, particularly younger women, in the vanguard. The\nresults have been the creation of various non-localized norms interposedbetween\nthe local vernaculars to which many older and less educated speakers still cling\nand standard RP, itself gradually atrophying.\nAITC08 211 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 212 Change\nJock girls Jock boys Burnout boys Burnout girls\nRange of behavior\nFigure 8.3 Jock and burnout behavior\nEckert\u2019s findings (1988, 1989, 1991, 2000, 2004) from her study of what she\ncalls \u2018jocks\u2019 and \u2018burnouts\u2019 in an almost exclusively white suburban Detroit high\nschool further complicates matters. \u2018Lifestyle\u2019 also seems to be a factor in change.\nJocks are either middle-class students or students with middle-class aspirations,\nand burnouts are either working-class students or students who wish to identify\nthemselves as such. Jocks tend to be college-bound and white-collar-oriented;\nburnouts will leave school for the blue-collar workplace. Jocks willinglyparticipate\nin the activities of the school; burnouts find activities outside school more at-\ntractive. We must note that only about one-third of the students readily iden-\ntified themselves as either jocks or burnouts but the in-betweens, the majority,\nleaned one way or the other. In general, on the linguistic variables that were\nexamined (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 1999) girls ranged far more widely\nthan boys. That is, the difference between jock and burnout girls was greater\nthan that between jock and burnout boys, as in figure 8.3. It would appear that,\nlinguistically, girls were required to do more than boys, i.e., to adopt more\nextreme behaviors in order to establish their places. They developed different\npractices within the communities within which they functioned. As Eckert says\n(2000, p. 35), \u2018A community of practice is an aggregate of people who come\ntogether around some enterprise. United by this common enterprise, people\ncome to develop and share ways of doing things, ways of talking, beliefs, values\n\u2013 in short, practices \u2013 as a function of their joint engagement in activity.\u2019 The\njocks and burnouts had entirely different social networks and norms of behavior\nbecause of the practices of their communities.\nThe jock\u2013burnout allegiance showed no relationship to social class andgender.\nIt was clearly some kind of ideological allegiance. Eckert found that burnouts\nwere much more active than jocks in participating in the NCS (see p. 194), with\nthe most burned-out burnouts clearly in the lead. They see themselves as part\nof the developing local urban landscape and are linguistically engaged in it.\nJocks, on the other hand, have a wider horizon but also one that leads them to\nlinguistic conservatism. Eckert (2000, pp. 1\u20132) comments as follows: \u2018Ultimately,\nthe social life of variation lies in the variety of individuals\u2019 ways of participating\nin their communities \u2013 their ways of fitting in, and of making their mark \u2013 their\nways of constructing meaning in their own lives.\u2019 Variation arises from what\nindividuals do with the language as they attempt to come to terms with their\nsurroundings.\nWhenever a change begins and whatever its causes, it is not an instantaneous\nevent for the language as a whole. It has to establish itself. A number of linguists\n(see Wang, 1969, 1977) have proposed a theory of change called lexical dif-\nfusion. According to this theory, a sound change spreads gradually through the\nAITC08 212 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 213\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nUnits of time\nFigure 8.4 Lexical diffusion over time\nSource: based on Bailey (1973)\nwords in which the change applies. For example, a change in vowel quality is\nnot instantaneous, affecting at some specific point in time all words in which\nthat vowel occurs, as if you went to bed one night with vowel quality A in those\nwords and got up next morning with vowel quality B. Instead, only some words\nthat have the vowel will be affected initially, then others, then still others, and\nso on until the change is complete.\nAccording to this view, change does not proceed at a uniform rate throughout\nthe affected vocabulary. Instead, there is an S-curve effect. That is, there is an\ninitial period of slow change in which as few as 20 percent of the relevant words\nundergo the change, then a shorter period of time of rapid change in which\nabout 60 percent of the affected words show the change, and a final period,\nagain of much the same length as the initial period, in which all or most \u2013 there\nis often a residue \u2013 of the remaining 20 percent of relevant words show the\nchange. Figure 8.4 shows this process of lexical diffusion over time.\nThis hypothesis allows us to make certain predictions. If a sound change is\nobserved to be occurring in less than a quarter of a set of words which have the\nnecessary conditions for changes, we are probably witnessing the beginning of\nthe process or, of course, the end if the rest of the words already show the\nchange to have occurred.

We can see\nthat at that point in the process half the speakers evidence the change in half\nthe words. (Note the similarity of figure 8.5 to figure 8.4.)\nThe theory of lexical diffusion has resemblances to the wave theory oflanguage\nchange: a wave is also a diffusion process. We can see, for example, that the\nRhenish Fan (see p. 137) shows how the diffusion of the Second German Con-\nsonant Shift stopped for different sounds in different places. Figure 8.6 uses the\ndata from figure 6.1 (p. 137) to illustrate how sound change diffuses from south\nto north in the affected sounds in four different words. Here the diffusion is\nover geographical space. However, after reviewing S-curve type diffusion as an\nAITC08 214 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM\negnahc\ngniwohs\nsmeti\nfo\n% Change 215\nNorth\nik makvn dorp dat\nix makvn dorp dat\nix maxvn dorp dat\nix maxvn dorf dat\nix maxvn dorf das\nSouth\nFigure 8.6 Second German Consonant Shift\nattempt to account for different changes that have occurred in English, Denison\n(2003) cautions that: \u2018The S-curve is neither as simple nor as uniform a phenom-\nenon as it is sometimes assumed. Given too the simplistic picture of variation\nit sometimes reflects (and requires), the S-curve should not be seized on too\nreadily as the general shape of language change\u2019 (p. 68).\nThe wave theory of change and the theory of lexical diffusion are very much\nalike. Each attempts to explain how a linguistic change spreads through a lan-\nguage; the wave theory makes claims about how people are affected by change,\nwhereas lexical diffusion makes claims concerning how a particular change\nspreads through the set of words in which the feature undergoing change\nactually occurs: diffusion through linguistic space. That the two theories deal\nwith much the same phenomenon is apparent when we look at how individuals\ndeal with such sets of words. What we find is that in individual usage the change\nis introduced progressively through the set, and once it is made in a particu-\nlar word it is not \u2018unmade\u2019, i.e., there is no reversion to previous use. What\nis remarkable is that, with a particular change in a particular set of words,\nspeakers tend to follow the same order of progression through the set; that is,\nall speakers seem to start with the same sub-set of words, have the same inter-\nmediate sub-set, and extend the change to the same final sub-set. For example,\nin Belfast the change from [\u00e4] to [\u00ce] in the vowel in words like pull, put, and\nshould shows a 74 percent incidence in the first word, a 39 percent incidence\nin the second, and only an 8 percent incidence in the third (Hudson, 1996, p. 182).\nIn East Anglia and the East Midlands of England a sound change is well\nestablished in must and come but the same change is found hardly at all in uncle\nand hundred (Chambers and Trudgill, 1998, p. 161). This diffusion is through\nsocial space.\nDevitt (1989) shows how five features of Standard English diffused into Scots\nEnglish between 1520 and 1659. She examined 121 different texts written by\nScottish writers for the incidence of English and Scots features: which andquhilk\nas a relative-clause marker; -ed and -it as a preterite inflection; no and na as a\nnegative particle; an and ane as an indefinite article; and -ing and -and as a\nAITC08 215 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 216 Change\nTable 8.6 Vowel assimilation in Teheran Persian in six words read by seven\nspeakers\nAssimilation by seven Assimilation in free\nspeakers reading word list speech by all speakers\nA B C D E F G % assimilated Total\n\/bekon\/\u2018Do!\u2019 + + + + + + 91 331\n\/bedo\/\u2018Run!\u2019 + + + + + 78 23\n\/bexan\/\u2018Read!\u2019 + + + + 40 139\n\/begu\/\u2018Tell!\u2019 + + + 22 132\n\/bekub\/\u2018Hit!\u2019 + + 4 122\n\/bebor\/\u2018Cut!\u2019 + 3 124\nSource: Hudson (1996, p. 184), based on Jahangiri (1980)\npresent participle ending. All the texts showed an increase in the use of the\nEnglish feature from about 15 percent to 90 percent during this period, with\n-ing leading the way followed by no. Devitt\u2019s study supports the S-curve view\nof diffusion; she says that although her sources showed only the middle part of\nthe process, \u2018The general pattern of anglicization, recurring across all five vari-\nables, appears to be the S-curve; the changes spread slowly at first, then spread\nvery rapidly before slowing down again at the end\u2019 (p. 46). She adds that the\nS-curve also applied to the different genres of writing although at different rates;\nreligious texts led the way in anglicization, followed by official correspondence,\nprivate records, personal correspondence, and, in last place, national public\nrecords.\nHudson (1996, p. 184) produces data from Teheran Persian (based on Jahangiri,\n1980) which show an even more remarkable pattern. Vowel assimilation in the\nfirst syllable of words like \/bekon\/\u2018Do!\u2019 is apparently progressing through a set\nof words in such a way that, if you hear a speaker assimilate the first vowel in\na word like \/begu\/\u2018Tell!\u2019, you can predict that the speaker also assimilates the\nfirst vowel in \/bexan\/\u2018Read!\u2019, \/bedo\/\u2018Run!\u2019, and \/bekon\/\u2018Do!\u2019 The data are given\nin table 8.6. They are interesting because the behavior of individuals is\nimplicational; that is, if speaker X assimilates the vowel in \/bebor\/\u2018Cut!\u2019, that\nspeaker also assimilates the vowel in all the other words in the set. But that\nbehavior also corresponds to group norms; that is, 91 percent of all speakers\nassimilate the vowel in \/bekon\/\u2018Do!\u2019 but only 3 percent assimilate the vowel in\n\/bebor\/\u2018Cut!\u2019. The data also suggest that a closer analysis might show an S-curve\nhere, since the two highest percentages are so high (91 and 78 percent) and the\ntwo lowest almost non-existent (3 and 4 percent). It appears that the change\nbegan with words like \/bekon\/ and \/bedo\/ and is now thoroughly established in\nthese, that it is progressing through words like \/bexan\/ and \/begu\/, and thatonly\nAITC08 216 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM Change 217\nin the most innovative speakers has it reached as far as words like \/bekub\/ and\n\/bebor\/. I should add that Hudson (1996) points out (p. 184) that data from ten\nspeakers concerning sixty words in all produced \u2018much messier\u2019 results, so that\na simple hypothesis of the uniform diffusion of change through the lexicon\nmight require modification.\nFurther messiness is found in the results reported by Hansen (2001) from a\nstudy of lexical diffusion in relation to an ongoing change in French nasal\nvowels, which appear to be undergoing a clockwise chain shift. She found that\nthis chain shift is indeed in progress, but it is not at all a simple one since \u2018both\na vowel\u2019s prosodic position and its phonetic surroundings in the spoken chain\nare relevant\u2019 (p. 227). The changes also vary by lexical item, found not at all\nin occurrences of sans but in better than 75 percent of occurrences of avant and\nmoment (p. 235). Word frequency was not a factor in change but word class\nappeared to be one. \u2018The type of sound change considered here mixes facets of\ntypical Neogrammarian and typically lexically diffused sound change\u2019 (p. 284).\nHowever, the overall mix appears to resist easy explanation.\nLabov\u2019s view of lexical diffusion is that it has only a very limited role to play\nin change. He says (1994, p. 501), \u2018There is no evidence...that lexical dif-\nfusion is the fundamental mechanism of sound change.\u2019 It happens but is only\na complement \u2013 and a small one at that \u2013 to regular sound change. The most\nimportant factors in linguistic change appear to be long-standing trends in the\nlanguage, internal variation, and social forces among speakers. These interact\nand the result is change. According to Labov, the key problem in explaining that\nchange is ascertaining the relevant data in both language and society, and then\nintegrating the resulting observations into a theory of change which will allow\nus to see how and why change is occurring and plot its course.\nAs I previously indicated, a number of sociolinguists hold the view that such\nendeavors are really what sociolinguistics is all about. If I agreed with them\nthese would be the final words of this book. They are not. There are still many\nmore interesting connections between language and society that deserve our\nattention.\nDiscussion\n1. Labov (1972b, p. 226) says of g-dropping, i.e., saying singin\u2019 for singing,\nthat \u2018we observe listeners reacting in a discrete way. Up to a certain point\nthey do not perceive the speaker \u201cdropping his g\u2019s\u201d at all; beyond a certain\npoint, they perceive him as always doing so.\u2019 How would you propose to\ntest this claim? If the claim is correct, what does it suggest about the way\nin which people react to language and to changes that occur in a language?\n2. Radio, movies, and television show a preponderant use of standard forms.\nSuch media might be expected to exert a considerable influence on linguistic\nchange. Do they, in fact? Try to state a few testable hypotheses on this\nmatter. Note the word testable. You may find it quite easy to come up with\na number of hypotheses, but the problem is how to test these rather than\njust assert them to be obvious truths or well-held beliefs.\nAITC08 217 5\/9\/05, 4:33 PM 218 Change\n3. Not every innovation takes root in a language. In fact, you can argue that\nmost innovations go nowhere. Note that the kinds of changes discussed in\nthis chapter seem to build on something that already exists in a language,\nthat is, some existing variant that is put to use. What kinds of linguistic\ninnovations have you observed to go nowhere? In what way or ways do\nsuch innovations fail to meet the various requirements for \u2018taking root\u2019 that\nare discussed in this chapter?\nFurther Reading\nLabov\u2019s views are most clearly expressed in his 1994 and 2001 books.

It would\nappear that the only problem is deciding the nature of the relationship and\nfinding suitable ways to demonstrate it. But, as we will see, what is \u2018obvious\u2019\nneed not necessarily be \u2018true\u2019: the sun does not rotate around the earth, nor is\nthe earth at the center of the universe! When we do try to specify any such\nrelationship, we run into problems that are no less formidable than those just\nmentioned: we may be misled by the \u2018obvious.\u2019 In this chapter we will look at\nvarious ways in which language and culture have been said to be related. As we\nwill see, some of the resulting claims are unprovable, others are intriguing, but\nonly one or two are potentially of great interest.\nA few words are necessary concerning what I mean by \u2018culture.\u2019 I do not\nintend to use the term culture in the sense of \u2018high culture,\u2019 i.e., the appreciation\nof music, literature, the arts, and so on. Rather, I intend to use it in the sense\nof whatever a person must know in order to function in a particular society.\nThis is the same sense as in Goodenough\u2019s well-known definition (1957, p. 167):\n\u2018a society\u2019s culture consists of whatever it is one has to know or believe in order\nto operate in a manner acceptable to its members, and to do so in any role that\nthey accept for any one of themselves.\u2019 That knowledge is socially acquired: the\nnecessary behaviors are learned and do not come from any kind of genetic\nendowment. Culture, therefore, is the \u2018know-how\u2019 that a person must possess to\nget through the task of daily living; only for a few does it require a knowledge\nof some, or much, music, literature, and the arts.\nWhorf\nOne long-standing claim concerning the relationship between language and culture\nis that the structure of a language determines the way in which speakers of that\nlanguage view the world. A somewhat weaker version is that the structure does\nAITC09 221 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 222 Words and Culture\nnot determine the world-view but is still extremely influential in predisposing\nspeakers of a language toward adopting a particular world-view. This claim has\nintrigued many anthropologists and linguists and there is a fairly extensive\nliterature concerning it. The opposite claim would be that the culture of a\npeople finds reflection in the language they employ: because they value certain\nthings and do them in a certain way, they come to use their language in ways\nthat reflect what they value and what they do. In this view, cultural requirements\ndo not determine the structure of a language \u2013 the claim is never that strong \u2013\nbut they certainly influence how a language is used and perhaps determine why\nspecific bits and pieces are the way they are. A third, \u2018neutral,\u2019 claim would be\nthat there is little or no relationship between language and culture.\nThe claim that the structure of a language influences how its speakers view\nthe world is today most usually associated with the linguist Sapir and hisstudent\nWhorf, a chemical engineer by training, a fire prevention engineer by vocation,\nand a linguist by avocation. However, it can be traced back to others, particu-\nlarly to Humboldt in the nineteenth century. Today, the claim is usually referred\nto as the Linguistic relativity hypothesis, Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis, or the Whorfian\nhypothesis. I will use the latter term since the claim seems to owemuch more\nto Whorf than it does to Sapir.\nSapir acknowledged the close relationship between language and culture, main-\ntaining that they were inextricably related so that you could not understand or\nappreciate the one without a knowledge of the other. The passage which most\nclearly summarizes his views (1929b, p. 207) is as follows:\nHuman beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of\nsocial activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the\nparticular language which has become the medium of expression for their society.\nIt is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the\nuse of language and that language is merely an incidental means of solving specific\nproblems of communication or reflection. The fact of the matter is that the \u2018real\nworld\u2019 is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the\ngroup....We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because\nthe language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation.\nWhorf extended these ideas, going much further than saying that there was a\n\u2018predisposition\u2019; in Whorf\u2019s view, the relationship between language and culture\nwas a deterministic one.\nOne of Whorf\u2019s strongest statements is the following (Carroll, 1956,\npp. 212\u201314):\nthe background linguistic system (in other words, the grammar) of each language\nis not merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas but rather is itself the\nshaper of ideas, the program and guide for the individual\u2019s mental activity, for his\nanalysis of impressions, for his synthesis of his mental stock in trade. Formulation\nof ideas is not an independent process, strictly rational in the old sense, but is part\nof a particular grammar, and differs, from slightly to greatly, between different\ngrammars. We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The\ncategories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find\nAITC09 222 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 223\nthere because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is\npresented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be organized by our\nminds \u2013 and this means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut\nnature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely\nbecause we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way \u2013 an agreement\nthat holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our\nlanguage. The agreement is, of course, an implicit and unstated one, but its terms\nare absolutely obligatory; we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organ-\nization and classification of data which the agreement decrees.\nAlthough this view is a deterministic one, Whorf actually twice uses the word\nlargely. He does not go all the way to say that the structure of a language com-\npletely determines the way its speakers view the world. However, he does go on\nto add (p. 214):\nThis fact is very significant for modern science, for it means that no individual is\nfree to describe nature with absolute impartiality but is constrained to certain\nmodes of interpretation even while he thinks himself most free. The person most\nnearly free in such respects would be a linguist familiar with very many widely\ndifferent linguistic systems. As yet no linguist is in any such position. We are thus\nintroduced to a new principle of relativity, which holds that all observers are not\nled by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their\nlinguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.\nIn this view different speakers will therefore experience the world differently\ninsofar as the languages they speak differ structurally, and not even the most\nsophisticated linguist aware of all the subtleties of structural differences among\nlanguages can escape to see the world as it is rather than as it is presented\nthrough the screen of this language or that.\nOn several occasions Fishman (particularly 1960 and 1972c) has written\nabout the Whorfian hypothesis concerning the kinds of claims it makes. One\nclaim is that, if speakers of one language have certain words to describe things\nand speakers of another language lack similar words, then speakers of the first\nlanguage will find it easier to talk about those things. We can see how this might\nbe the case if we consider the technical vocabulary of any trade, calling, or pro-\nfession; for example, physicians talk easily about medical phenomena, more\neasily than you or I, because they have the vocabulary to do so. A stronger claim\nis that, if one language makes distinctions that another does not make, then\nthose who use the first language will more readily perceive the differences in\ntheir environment which such linguistic distinctions draw attention to. If you\nmust classify camels, boats, and automobiles in certain ways, you will perceive\ncamels, boats, and automobiles differently from someone who is not required to\nmake these differentiations. If your language classifies certain material objects\nas long and thin and others as roundish, you will perceive material objects that\nway; they will fall quite \u2018naturally\u2019 into those classes for you.\nThis extension into the area of grammar could be argued to be a further\nstrengthening of Whorf\u2019s claim, since classification systems pertaining to shape,\nsubstance, gender, number, time, and so on are both more subtle and more\nAITC09 223 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 224 Words and Culture\npervasive. Their effect is much stronger on language users than vocabulary\ndifferences alone. The strongest claim of all is that the grammatical categories\navailable in a particular language not only help the users of that language to\nperceive the world in a certain way but also at the same time limit such percep-\ntion. They act as blinkers: you perceive only what your language allows you, or\npredisposes you, to perceive. Your language controls your \u2018world-view.\u2019Speakers\nof different languages will, therefore, have different world-views.\nWhorf\u2019s ideas were based on two kinds of experience. One was acquired\nthrough his work as a fire prevention engineer for the Hartford Fire Insurance\nCompany; the other was acquired through his linguistic work, as Sapir\u2019sstudent,\non Amerindian languages, principally on the Hopi language of Arizona. In his\nwork investigating the origins of fires, Whorf found that speakers of English\nwould use the words full and empty in describing gasoline drums but only in\nrelation to their liquid content; consequently, they would smoke beside \u2018empty\u2019\ngasoline drums, which were actually \u2018full\u2019 of gas vapor. He found otherexamples\nof such behavior and was led to conclude that \u2018the cue to a certain line of\nbehavior is often given by the analogies of the linguistic formula in which the\nsituation is spoken of, and by which to some degree it is analyzed, classified, and\nallotted its place in that world which is \u201cto a large extent unconsciously built\nup on the language habits of the group\u201d\u2019 (Carroll, 1956, p. 137).\nHowever, it was his work on Amerindian languages that led Whorf to make\nhis strongest claims. He contrasted the linguistic structure of Hopi with the\nkinds of linguistic structure he associated with languages such as English, French,\nGerman, and so on, that is, familiar European languages. He saw theselanguages\nas sharing so many structural features that he named this whole group of\nlanguages Standard Average European (SAE). According to Whorf, Hopi and\nSAE differ widely in their structural characteristics. For example, Hopi gram-\nmatical categories provide a \u2018process\u2019 orientation toward the world, whereas\nthe categories in SAE give SAE speakers a fixed orientation toward time and\nspace so that they not only \u2018objectify\u2019 reality in certain ways but even distinguish\nbetween things that must be counted, e.g., trees, hills, waves, and sparks, and\nthose that need not be counted, e.g., water, fire, and courage. In SAE eventsoccur,\nhave occurred, or will occur, in a definite time, i.e., present, past, or future; to\nspeakers of Hopi, what is important is whether an event can be warranted to\nhave occurred, or to be occurring, or to be expected to occur. Whorf believed\nthat these differences lead speakers of Hopi and SAE to view the world differ-\nently. The Hopi see the world as essentially an ongoing set of processes; objects\nand events are not discrete and countable; and time is not apportioned into\nfixed segments so that certain things recur, e.g., minutes, mornings, and days. In\ncontrast, speakers of SAE regard nearly everything in their world as discrete,\nmeasurable, countable, and recurrent; time and space do not flow into eachother;\nsparks, flames, and waves are things like pens and pencils; mornings recur in\ntwenty-four-hour cycles; and past, present, and future are every bit as real as\ngender differences. The different languages have different obligatorygrammatical\ncategories so that every time a speaker of Hopi or SAE says something, he orshe\nmust make certain observations about how the world is structured because of\nthe structure of the language each speaks. (We should note that Malotki (1983)\nAITC09 224 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 225\nhas pointed out that some of Whorf\u2019s claims about the grammatical structure\nof Hopi are either dubious or incorrect, e.g., Hopi, like SAE, does have verbs\nthat are inflected for tense.)\nIn the Whorfian view, language provides a screen or filter to reality; it deter-\nmines how speakers perceive and organize the world around them, both the\nnatural world and the social world. Consequently, the language you speak helps\nto form your world-view. It defines your experience for you; you do not use it\nsimply to report that experience. It is not neutral but acts as a filter. Romaine\n(1999) states the position as follows: \u2018No particular language or way of speak-\ning has a privileged view of the world as it \u201creally\u201d is. The world is not simply\nthe way it is, but what we make of it through language. The domains of\nexperience that are important to cultures get grammaticalized into languages...\n[and] no two languages are sufficiently similar to be considered as representing\nthe same social reality.\u2019\nThose who find this hypothesis attractive argue that the language a person\nspeaks affects that person\u2019s relationship to the external world in one or more\nways. If language A has a word for a particular concept, then that word makes\nit easier for speakers of language A to refer to that concept than speakers of\nlanguage B who lack such a word and are forced to use a circumlocution.\nMoreover, it is actually easier for speakers of language A to perceive instancesof\nthe concept. If a language requires certain distinctions to be made because of\nits grammatical system, then the speakers of that language become conscious\nof the kinds of distinctions that must be referred to: for example, gender, time,\nnumber, and animacy. These kinds of distinctions may also have an effect on\nhow speakers learn to deal with the world, i.e., they can have consequences for\nboth cognitive and cultural development.\nData such as the following are sometimes cited in support of such claims. The\nGaro of Assam, India, have dozens of words for different types of baskets, rice,\nand ants. These are important items in their culture. However, they have no\nsingle-word equivalent to the English word ant. Ants are just too important\nto them to be referred to so casually. German has words like Gem\u00fctlichkeit,\nWeltanschauung, and Weihnachtsbaum; English has no exact equivalent of any\none of them, Christmas tree being fairly close in the last case but still lacking\nthe \u2018magical\u2019 German connotations. Both people and bulls have legs in English,\nbut Spanish requires people to have piernas and bulls to have patas. Both people\nand horses eat in English but in German people essen and horses fressen. Bedouin\nArabic has many words for different kinds of camels, just as the Trobriand\nIslanders of the Pacific have many words for different kinds of yams. The\nNavaho of the Southwest United States, the Shona of Zimbabwe, and the\nHanun\u00f3o of the Philippines divide the color spectrum differently from each\nother in the distinctions they make, and English speakers divide it differently\nagain. English has a general cover term animal for various kinds of creatures,\nbut it lacks a term to cover both fruit and nuts; however, Chinese does have\nsuch a cover term. French conscience is both English conscience and conscious-\nness. Both German and French have two pronouns corresponding to you, a\nsingular and a plural. Japanese, on the other hand, has an extensive system of\nhonorifics. The equivalent of English stone has a gender in French and German,\nAITC09 225 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 226 Words and Culture\nand the various words must always be either singular or plural in French,\nGerman, and English. In Chinese, however, number is expressed only if it is\nsomehow relevant. The Kwakiutl of British Columbia must also indicate whether\nthe stone is visible or not to the speaker at the time of speaking, as well as its\nposition relative to one or another of the speaker, the listener, or possible third\nparty. Some Japanese sentences are almost completely the reverse of correspond-\ning English sentences in their word order.\nLucy (1992a, 1996) tried to test Whorf\u2019s ideas. He used the grammatical\ncategory of number in English and in Yucatec Maya, a language of Mexico.\nBoth languages mark nouns for plural. English, however, has a contrast between\n\u2018count\u2019 nouns like tree and book and \u2018mass\u2019 nouns like water and sugar (we say\ntrees and books but not waters and sugars, except in very markedcircumstances).\nYucatec pluralization is optional and then only for nouns denoting animates.\nLucy hypothesized that English speakers would be more conscious of the num-\nbers of objects they see than Yucatec speakers and would also see more objects\nas countable. He asked speakers of the two languages to look at pictures of\nordinary village life and, using a cleverly devised non-verbal test requiring sort-\ning and recall, found that the two groups did differ in the predicted directions:\nIn remembering and classifying, English speakers were sensitive to numbers for\nanimate entities and objects but not for substances. By contrast, Yucatec speakers\nwere sensitive to number only for animate entities...the two groups had verysimilar\npatterns of response for the animate and substance referents where the twolanguages\nroughly agree in structure, but...they differed with respect to ordinary object\nreferents, that is, where the grammars of the two languages are in maximalcontrast.\n(1996, pp. 49\u201350)\nOther tests produced similar results. Some evidence, therefore, does exist for the\nkind of claims Whorf made.\nGiven such evidence, we are faced with the task of drawing defensible con-\nclusions. Those conclusions are generally different from the ones that Whorf\ndrew. For example, the words fist, wave, spark, and flame are nouns in English,\nso we tend to see the events or actions they name as having some kind of\nexistence as \u2018things.\u2019 But we also know that this existence is of a different kind\nfrom that of houses, rocks, cats, and trees. We can, therefore, understand that\nwords for the same events or actions can appear as verbs in Hopi: we know that\nhouses and rocks comprise a different order of \u2018things\u2019 from fists and waves.\nOne language refers to certain characteristics of the real world in terms of one\npossible sub-set of characteristics; another favors a different sub-set. However,\nspeakers of both languages may still be aware of all the characteristics. They are\nnot required to refer to all of them.\nSyntactic evidence can also mislead investigators. Much of the evidence is\nprovided by literal translation, as though breakfast were understood as a \u2018break\nin a fast,\u2019 or cats as \u2018cat\u2019 plus \u2018plural,\u2019 as though in a group of cats one cat were\nnoticed independently of, and before, the presence of the other cats. Over-literal\ntranslation is very dangerous, particularly of metaphoric language. English, for\nexample, is full of metaphors: \u2018I see what you mean,\u2019 \u2018He grasped the idea,\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re behind the times,\u2019 and so on. At best, the syntactic evidence suggests\nAITC09 226 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 227\nthat languages allow their speakers to make certain observations more easily in\nsome cases than others. An obligatory grammatical category, for example tense-\nmarking in English verbs, will lead to certain things being said in English that\nneed not be said, for example in Chinese. Periodically, scholars meet to examine\nWhorf\u2019s ideas but the results (e.g., P\u00fctz and Verspoor, 2000, and Enfield, 2002)\ntend to be either disappointing or inconclusive. There continues to be little\nagreement as to exactly what Whorf meant, how the hypothesis associated with\nhis name can be tested, and what any \u2018results\u2019 might indicate.\nPinker (1994, pp. 59\u201367) has no patience at all for any of Whorf\u2019s ideas. He\nsays that Whorf\u2019s claims were \u2018outlandish,\u2019 his arguments were circular, any\nevidence he gave for them was either anecdotal or suspect in some other way,\nand all the experiments conducted to test the ideas have proved nothing. How-\never, Whorf\u2019s ideas still exert their fascination. Do different languages produce\ndifferent world-views? That question is certainly behind many linguists\u2019 belief\nthat endangered languages should be protected (see, for example, Dixon, 1997,\np. 144, and Nettle and Romaine, 2000). It is also, as we will see in chapter 14,\nbehind the idea that teaching a standard language to a child who speaks some\nnonstandard variety is essentially a liberating, empowering act. These are but\ntwo examples.\nBroader attempts to relate types of language structure to patterns of social\norganization have also met with failure. One problem has been trying to char-\nacterize languages by structural types. Language typology is an interesting topic\nin its own right (see Comrie, 1989), but it is somewhat doubtful that there is\nany close relationship between the particular types of language, no matter how\nthese are defined, and the cultures of the people who speak them. Boas (1911)\nlong ago pointed out that there was no necessary connection between language\nand culture or between language and race. People with very different cultures\nspeak languages with many of the same structural characteristics, e.g., Hun-\ngarians, Finns, and the Samoyeds of northern Siberia; and people who speak\nlanguages with very different structures often share much the same culture, e.g.,\nGermans and Hungarians, or many people in southern India, or the widespread\nIslamic culture. Moreover, we can also dismiss any claim that certain types of\nlanguages can be associated with \u2018advanced\u2019 cultures and that others are indi-\ncative of cultures that are less advanced. As Sapir himself observed on this last\npoint (1921, p. 219), \u2018When it comes to linguistic form, Plato walks with the\nMacedonian swineherd, Confucius with the head-hunting savage of Assam.\u2019\nFinally, the claim that it would be impossible to describe certain things in a\nparticular language because that language lacks the necessary resources is only\npartially valid at best. We must assume that all languages possess the resources\nthat any speaker might require to say anything that he or she might want to say\nin that language. Some languages, like English, Russian, French, and Chinese,for\nexample, have had these resources developed in a tremendous variety of ways.\nBut there is no reason to suppose that any other language is incapable of similar\ndevelopment. It might be difficult currently to discuss advanced nuclear physics\nin Tukano or Basque, but should a compelling necessity arise in the Tukano-\nspeaking and Basque-speaking communities for people to become experts in\nnuclear physics and use Tukano and Basque to do so, the two languages should\nAITC09 227 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 228 Words and Culture\nprove quite adequate. No society has rejected such modern \u2018advances\u2019 as tele-\nvision, computers, and sophisticated weaponry because its people lacked the\nlinguistic resources to use them. As recent events in many parts of the world\nhave shown, one can go from camels and abacuses to Mercedes and computers\nin but a few short years.\nThe most valid conclusion concerning the Whorfian hypothesis is that it is still\nunproved. It appears to be quite possible to talk about anything in any language\nprovided a speaker is willing to use some degree of circumlocution. However,\nsome concepts may be more \u2018codable,\u2019 that is, easier to express, in some lan-\nguages than in others. A speaker, of course, will not be aware of such circum-\nlocution in the absence of familiarity with another language that uses a more\nsuccinct means of expression. Every natural language not only provides its\nspeakers with a language for talking about every other language, that is, a\nmetalanguage, but also provides them with an entirely adequate system for\nmaking any kinds of observations that they need to make about the world. If\nsuch is the case, every natural language must be an extremely rich system, one\nthat allows its users to overcome any predispositions that exist and to do this\nwithout much difficulty.\nDiscussion\n1. Sapir (1921, pp. 92\u20133) makes the following observation about the equiva-\nlents in Chinese and Kwakiutl, an Amerindian language, of the English\nsentence, \u2018The farmer kills the duckling\u2019:\nIn the Chinese sentence \u2018Man kill duck,\u2019 which may be looked upon as the\npractical equivalent of \u2018The man kills the duck,\u2019 there is by no means present\nfor the Chinese consciousness that childish, halting, empty feeling which we\nexperience in the literal English translation. The three concrete concepts \u2013 two\nobjects and an action \u2013 are each directly expressed by a monosyllabic word....\nDefiniteness or indefiniteness of reference, number, personality as an inherent\naspect of the verb tense, not to speak of gender \u2013 all these are given no\nexpression in the Chinese sentence....Nothing has been said...as to the\nplace relations of the farmer, the duck, the speaker, and the listener. Are the\nfarmer and the duck both visible or is one or the other invisible from the point\nof view of the speaker, and are both placed within the horizon of the speaker,\nthe listener, or of some indefinite point of reference \u2018off yonder\u2019? In other\nwords, to paraphrase awkwardly certain latent \u2018demonstrative\u2019 ideas, does this\nfarmer (invisible to us but standing behind a door not far away from me, you\nbeing seated yonder well out of reach) kill that duckling (which belongs to\nyou)? or does that farmer (who lives in your neighborhood and whom we see\nover there) kill that duckling (that belongs to him)? This type of demonstrative\nelaboration is foreign to our way of thinking, but it would seem very natural,\nindeed unavoidable, to a Kwakiutl Indian.\nWhat inferences might you want to draw from Sapir\u2019s examples about the\ndifferent cultures that are represented? How confident can you be about\nthese inferences?\nAITC09 228 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 229\n2. A language like English makes use of \u2018natural gender\u2019; German and French\nemploy \u2018grammatical gender\u2019; and Chinese does without either. What do\nsuch facts tell us about the \u2018world-views\u2019 of those who speak English, German,\nFrench, and Chinese?\n3. Many people in the world are completely bilingual or even multilingual in\nlanguages with very different structures. Consider this fact in relation to the\nWhorfian hypothesis. What are some of the implications? How might you\nattempt to test these experimentally?\nKinship\nOne interesting way in which people use language in daily living is to refer to\nvarious kinds of kin. It is not surprising, therefore, that there is a considerable\nliterature on kinship terminology, describing how people in various parts of the\nworld refer to relatives by blood (or descent) and marriage. Kinship systems are\na universal feature of languages, because kinship is so important in social organ-\nization. Some systems are much richer than others, but all make use of such\nfactors as gender, age, generation, blood, and marriage in their organization.\nOne of the attractions that kinship systems have for investigators is that these\nfactors are fairly readily ascertainable. You can therefore relate them with con-\nsiderable confidence to the actual words that people use to describe a particular\nkin relationship.\nThere may be certain difficulties, of course. You can ask a particular person\nwhat he or she calls others who have known relationships to that person, for\nexample, that person\u2019s father (Fa), or mother\u2019s brother (MoBr), or mother\u2019s\nsister\u2019s husband (MoSiHu), in an attempt to show how individuals employ\nvarious terms, but without trying to specify anything concerning the semantic\ncomposition of those terms: for example, in English, both your father\u2019s father\n(FaFa) and your mother\u2019s father (MoFa) are called grandfather, but that term\nincludes another term, father. You will find, too, in English that your brother\u2019s\nwife\u2019s father (BrWiFa) cannot be referred to directly; brother\u2019s wife\u2019s father (or\nsister-in-law\u2019s father) is a circumlocution rather than the kind of term that is of\ninterest in kinship terminology.\nThis kind of approach sometimes runs into serious difficulties. It is often\nvirtually impossible to devise an exhaustive account of a particular system. You\nmay also be unable to account for the many instances you may find of terms\nwhich are very obviously kinship terms but are used with people who are very\nobviously not kin by any of the criteria usually employed, e.g., the Vietnamese\nuse of terms equivalent to English sister, brother, uncle, and aunt in varioussocial\nrelationships. Such an approach also misses the fact that certain terms recur to\nmark different relationships; for example, English uncle is used to designate\nFaBr, MoBr, FaSiHu, and MoSiHu, and also non-kin relationships, as when chil-\ndren are sometimes taught to use it for close friends of their parents. A rather\ndifferent approach to kinship terminology is therefore often employed.\nAITC09 229 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 230 Words and Culture\nIn this latter approach, an investigator seeks to explain why sometimes dif-\nferent relationships are described by the same term, e.g., why Spanish t\u00edo is\nequivalent to both English uncle and either father\u2019s or mother\u2019s male cousin,\nand why similar relationships are described by different terms. Burling (1970,\npp. 21\u20137) describes the kinship system of the Njamal, a tribe of Australianabori-\ngines, in this way. To understand why the Njamal use the terms they do, you\nmust know that every Njamal belongs to one of two \u2018moieties,\u2019 that of his (or\nher) father; the mother belongs to the other moiety. Marriage must be with\nsomeone from the other moiety so that husbands and wives and fathers and\nmothers represent different moiety membership. This fact, and the need also to\nindicate the generation, and sometimes the sex, of the reference or ego (i.e., the\nperson from whom the relationship is expressed), and occasionally the other\u2019s\nage relative to the ego (i.e., as being younger or older), provide the keys to\nunderstanding the Njamal system.\nOne consequence is that a young Njamal man calls by the same name, njuba,\nhis mother\u2019s brother\u2019s daughter (MoBrDa) and his father\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter\n(FaSiDa), which are both English cousin. But he uses turda for his father\u2019s\nbrother\u2019s daughter (FaBrDa) and his mother\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter (MoSiDa) when\nboth are older than he is. He calls any such daughters who are younger than\nhe is maraga. All of these are cousins in English. He may marry a njuba, since\na cross-cousin is of the opposite moiety, but he cannot marry a turda or a\nmaraga, a parallel cousin of the same moiety. Moiety membership is the over-\nriding consideration in the classification system, being stronger than sex.\nFor example, a term like maili is marked as \u2018male,\u2019 e.g., FaFa, FaMoHu, or\nFaMoBrWiBr when used to refer to someone in an ascending generation and\nin the same moiety. In a descending generation, however, maili is also used to\ndesignate membership in the same moiety, but in this case it can be applied to\nboth males and females, to DaDaHu, BrSoDa, and DaSoWiSi.\nIn such an approach, we collect the various kinship terms in use in aparticular\nsociety and then attempt to determine the basic components of each term. We\nmay go even further. For example, as Hudson (1996, pp. 85\u20136) points out, in\nvarious societies, including the Seminole Indians of Florida and Oklahoma andthe\nTrobriand Islanders of the Pacific, a single term may refer to a very differenttype\nof relationship, e.g., father (Fa), father\u2019s brother (FaBr), and so on to includeeven\nfather\u2019s father\u2019s sister\u2019s son\u2019s son (FaFaSiSoSo), but to exclude father\u2019s father (FaFa).\nHudson points out that the key to understanding such a system is to assume\nthat there is some typical concept as \u2018father\u2019 and that there are certain \u2018equiva-\nlence rules\u2019 such that (a) a man\u2019s sister is equivalent to his mother; (b) siblings\nof the same sex are equivalent to each other; and (c) half-siblings are equivalent\nto full siblings. Since same-sex siblings are equivalent, \u2018father\u2019s brother\u2019 equals\n\u2018father.\u2019 The complicated \u2018father\u2019s father\u2019s sister\u2019s son\u2019s son\u2019 reduces to the term\nfor \u2018father,\u2019 as can be seen in table 9.1. In this system the same term is used for\nall the relationships shown in the table. We might feel it strange that one should\nrefer to so many different kinds of relationship with a single term, but this is\nbecause we live in very different circumstances, in which not knowing who your\nfather\u2019s father\u2019s sister\u2019s son\u2019s son is may be more usual than knowing this informa-\ntion. Then too, having to use such a potent term as father to refer to thatperson,\nAITC09 230 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 231\nTable 9.1 Relationships and equivalences in a kinship system\nRelationship Equivalences\nfather\u2019s father\u2019s sister\u2019s son\u2019s son\n\u2193 (a) sister = mother\nfather\u2019s father\u2019s mother\u2019s son\u2019s son\n\u2193 (c) mother\u2019s son = brother\nfather\u2019s father\u2019s brother\u2019s son\n\u2193 (b) father\u2019s brother = father\nfather\u2019s father\u2019s son\n\u2193 (c) father\u2019s son = brother\nfather\u2019s brother\n\u2193 (b) father\u2019s brother = father\nfather\nSource: based on Hudson (1996, p. 86)\nwho may well be younger than oneself, would cause us additional concern.Some\npeople do, of course, use father to people other than their male biologicalparents,\ne.g., to in-laws, adoptive parents, and priests; but these usages tend to be marked,\ni.e., rather special, in ways that the above usage is not.\nIt is important to remember that when a term like father, brother, or older\nbrother is used in a kinship system, it carries with it ideas about how such\npeople ought to behave toward others in the society that uses that system.\nFathers, brothers, and older brothers are assumed to have certain rights and\nduties. In practice, of course, they may behave otherwise. It is the kinship system\nwhich determines who is called what; it is not the behavior of individuals which\nleads them to be called this or that.\nAs social conditions change, we can expect kinship systems to change to\nreflect the new conditions. The profound social change in Russian society in the\nlast century produced certain changes in Russian kinship designation. At one\ntime it was very important to identify certain in-laws. There were separate\nwords for your wife\u2019s brother, shurin, and for your brother\u2019s wife, nevestka. In\nmodern Russian these unitary terms are no longer used. Instead, the phrases\nbrat zheny \u2018brother of wife\u2019 and zhena brata \u2018wife of brother\u2019 are used. Like-\nwise, yatrov \u2018husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife\u2019 has totally disappeared, and the term\nsvoyak is now used to refer to any male relative by marriage when previously\nit could be used only for your wife\u2019s sister\u2019s husband. It is now no longer neces-\nsary to refer constantly to such relatives or to be so precise as to a particular\nrelationship. Changing family structures have removed them from daily contact.\nThe new longer phrasal terms also indicate the current lack of importance given\nto certain kinship relationships, in keeping with a general linguistic principle\nthat truly important objects and relationships tend to be expressed through\nsingle words rather than through phrases.\nAITC09 231 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 232 Words and Culture\nDiscussion\n1. Look at the English kinship system, particularly your own version of it, and\nconsider the various relationships covered by terms such as greatgrandfather,\nuncle, niece, cousin, step-sister, half-brother, second cousin once removed,\nand father-in-law. Where are distinctions made to do with such factors as\ngender, generation, blood, and marriage? Where are such distinctions not\nmade? Is godson part of the system?\n2. Terms such as uncle, father, mother, sister, brother, son, and cousin are\nsometimes used outside the English kinship system. Describe these uses and\ntry to account for them.\n3. Family structures are changing: in many parts of the world the extended\nfamily is becoming less and less important as the nuclear family grows in\nimportance; divorce results in one-parent families; remarriage results in mixed\nfamilies. What are some of the consequences for kinship terminology? For\nexample, whereas you can have an ex-wife, can you have an ex-father-in-\nlaw? Are two people who live together necessarily husband and wife? If\nnot, what are they? In a remarriage do his children, her children, and their\nchildren learn to distinguish whose cousins, uncles, and so on are whose?\n4. If a language uses a term equivalent to English mother to cover MoSi,\nMoBrDa, and MoBrSiDa, and a term equivalent to English sister to cover\nFaBrDa, FaFaSi, and FaSi, what hypotheses might you be tempted to make\nconcerning differences between the family structure of speakers of such a\nlanguage and your own family structure?\nTaxonomies\nThe above discussion of kinship terminology shows how basic are certainsystems\nof classification in language and society. Language itself has its own classes of\nunits: vowels and consonants; nouns and verbs; statements and questions; and\nso on. People also use language to classify and categorize various aspects of the\nworld in which they live, but they do not always classify things the way scien-\ntists do; they often develop systems which we call folk taxonomies rather than\nscientific classifications. A folk taxonomy is a way of classifying a certain part\nof reality so that it makes some kind of sense to those who have to deal with\nit. Typically, such taxonomies involve matters like naturally occurring flora and\nfauna in the environment, but they may also involve other matters too (see\nBerlin, 1992).\nOne of the best-known studies of a folk taxonomy is Frake\u2019s account (1961)\nof the terms that the Subanun of Mindanao in the southern Philippines use to\ndescribe disease. There is a considerable amount of disease among the Subanun\nand they discuss it at length, particularly diseases of the skin. Effective treatment\nof any disease depends on proper diagnosis, but that itself depends onrecognizing\nAITC09 232 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 233\nthe symptoms for what they are. Much effort, therefore, goes into discussing\nsymptoms. As Frake says (pp. 130\u20131):\nThe \u2018real\u2019 world of disease presents a continuum of symptomatic variation which\ndoes not always fit neatly into conceptual pigeonholes. Consequently the diagnosis\nof a particular condition may evoke considerable debate: one reason a patient\nnormally solicits diagnostic advice from a variety of people. But the debate does\nnot concern the definition of a diagnostic category, for that is clear and wellknown;\nit concerns the exemplariness of a particular set of symptoms to the definition.\nThe Subanun have a variety of categories available to them when they dis-\ncuss a particular set of symptoms. These categories allow them to discuss those\nsymptoms at various levels of generality. For example, nuka can refer to skin\ndisease in general but it can also mean \u2018eruption.\u2019 A nuka may be further\ndistinguished as a beldut \u2018sore\u2019 rather than a me\u00baabag \u2018inflammation\u2019 or buni\n\u2018ringworm,\u2019 and then the particular beldut can be further distinguished as a\ntelemaw \u2018distal ulcer\u2019 or even a telemaw glai \u2018shallow distal ulcer.\u2019 What we\nhave is a hierarchy of terms with a term like nuka at the top and telemaw glai\nat the bottom. For example, in this case a telemaw glai contrasts with a telemaw\nbilgun \u2018deep distal ulcer.\u2019 As Frake says (p. 131):\nConceptually the disease world, like the plant world, exhaustively divides into a set\nof mutually exclusive categories. Ideally, every illness either fits into one category\nor is describable as a conjunction of several categories. Subanun may debate, or\nnot know, the placement of a particular case, but to their minds that reflects\na deficiency in their individual knowledge, not a deficiency in the classificatory\nsystem. As long as he accepts it as part of his habitat and not \u2018foreign,\u2019 a Subanun,\nwhen confronted with an illness, a plant, or an animal, may say he does not know\nthe name. He will never say there is no name.\nDiagnosis is the process of finding the appropriate name for a set of symptoms.\nOnce that name is found, treatment can follow. However, we can see that the\nsuccess of that treatment depends critically not only on its therapeutic value but\non the validity of the system of classification for diseases: that last system is a\n\u2018folk\u2019 one, not a scientific one.\nBurling (1970, pp. 14\u201317) has applied this same kind of analysis of part of\nthe vocabulary of a language to the pronoun system in Palaung, a languagespoken\nin Burma. There are eleven pronouns altogether, and these can be plotted as in\ntable 9.2, using the components shown in that table. Such an analysis indicates\nthat we can associate certain phonological features we find in the pronoun sys-\ntem to components of meaning: -ar \u2018duality,\u2019 -y \u2018more than two,\u2019 and the initial\ny-, p-, and g- related to various combinations of \u2018inclusion\u2019 and \u2018exclusion\u2019 of\n\u2018speaker\u2019 and \u2018hearer.\u2019 The analysis also shows us that pronouns referring to a\nsingle person (\u00d1, mi, and \u00cen) exist as a separate phonological set.\nAnalyses into taxonomies and components are useful in that they help us to\norganize data in ways that appear to indicate how speakers use their lan-\nguages to organize the world around them. The analyses show how systematic\nmuch of that behavior is and do so in a rather surprising way.

In a discussion of the various classificatory systems that speakers of differ-\nent languages employ, Loveday (1982, p. 39) gives the following example:\nThe Kwaio of the Solomon Islands label fresh water as one substance,\nsalt water as another; they place birds and bats in one category in contrast to\nmoths, butterflies and the like; they class fish and marine mammals together;\nand they label with a single term colours westerners call blue and black\n(Keesing and Keesing 1971).

A January flight from Acapulco, Mexico, to Toronto, Canada,\ntakes one from a sun-drenched array of colors to a gray drabness. Except to\nthose blinded to it, color is all around but it is not everywhere treated in the\nsame way. The terms people use to describe color give us another means of\nexploring the relationships between different languages and cultures. The color\nspectrum is a physical continuum showing no breaks at all. Yet we parcel it out\nin bits and pieces and assign names to the various component parts: green, blue,\nyellow, red, and so on. We also find that we sometimes cannot directly translate\ncolor words from one language to another without introducing subtle changes\nin meaning, e.g., English brown and French brun. An interesting issue is how\ncolors are referred to in different languages. Are color terms arbitrary, or is there\na general pattern? If there is a pattern, what are its characteristics and why\nmight it exist? Berlin and Kay (1969) tried to answer questions such as these,\ndrawing on data from a wide variety of languages.\nAll languages make use of basic color terms. A basic color term must be a\nsingle word, e.g., blue or yellow, not some combination of words, e.g., light blue\nor pale yellow. Nor must it be the obvious sub-division of some higher-order term,\nas both crimson and scarlet are of red. It must have quite general use; i.e., it\nmust not be applied only to a very narrow range of objects, as, for example,\nblond is applied in English almost exclusively to the color of hair and wood.\nAlso, the term must not be highly restricted in the sense that it is used by only\na specific sub-set of speakers, such as interior decorators or fashion writers.\nAccording to Berlin and Kay, an analysis of the basic color terms found in a\nwide variety of languages reveals certain very interesting patterns. If a language\nhas only two terms, they are for equivalents to black and white (or dark and\nlight). If a third is added, it is red. The fourth and fifth terms will be yellow\nand green, but the order may be reversed. The sixth and seventh terms are blue\nand brown. Finally, as in English, come terms like gray, pink, orange, and\npurple, but not in any particular order. In this view there are only eleven basic\ncolor terms (although Russian is acknowledged to have twelve since it has two\nin the blue region: sinij \u2018dark blue\u2019 and goluboj \u2018light blue\u2019). All other terms for\ncolors are combinations like grayish-brown, variations like scarlet, modifica-\ntions like fire-engine red, and finally the kinds of designations favored by paint\nand cosmetic manufacturers.\nAn attempt has been made to relate the extent of color terminology in specific\nlanguages with the level of cultural and technical complexity of the societies in\nwhich these languages are spoken. There is some reason to believe that commu-\nnities that show little technological development employ the fewest color terms;\ne.g., the Jal\u00e9 of New Guinea have words corresponding to dark and light alone.\nOn the other hand, technologically advanced societies have terms corresponding\nto all eleven mentioned above. Societies in intermediate stages have intermediate\nnumbers: for example, the Tiv of Nigeria have three terms; the Garo of Assam\nand the Hanun\u00f3o of the Philippines have four; and the Burmese have seven.\nAITC09 235 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 236 Words and Culture\nOne approach to investigating color terminology in languages is predicated on\nthe scientific fact that the color spectrum is an objective reality: it is \u2018out there,\u2019\nwaiting to be dealt with and, moreover, we know that humans possess rods and\ncones in their retinas specifically dedicated to color perception. Consequently, if\nyou ask speakers of a language to name chips from the Munsell array of color\nchips you can access their knowledge of what color means to them. The claim\nhere is that human cognition is so alike everywhere that everyone approaches\nthe spectrum in the same way. Moreover, as cultural and technological changes\noccur, it becomes more and more necessary for people to differentiate within the\ncolor spectrum. Instead of picking bits and pieces of the spectrum at random as\nit were and naming them, people, no matter what languages they speak, progres-\nsively sub-divide the whole spectrum in a systematic way. The similar naming\npractices appear to follow from human cognitive needs that are the same\neverywhere.\nLucy (1997) is highly critical of the above claim, declaring that you cannot\nfind out what \u2018color\u2019 means to speakers by simply asking them to label Munsell\ncolor chips. He says (p. 341): \u2018color is not \u201cout there\u201d in the light but in our\nperceptual interpretation of light,...communicatively relevant encodings of visual\nexperience do not lie \u201cin there\u201d in the biology but in socially anchored linguistic\nsystems.\u2019 In this alternate view, color systems are social constructions ratherthan\nbiologically determined ones. The issue is still unresolved.\nWe do know that if speakers of any language are asked to identify the parts\nof the spectrum, they find one system of such identification much easier to\nmanipulate than another. They find it difficult to draw a line to separate that\npart of the spectrum they would call yellow from that part they would call\norange, or similarly to separate blue from green. That is, assigning precise\nborders, or marking discontinuities, between neighboring colors is neither an\neasy task for individuals nor one on which groups of individuals achieve a\nremarkable consensus. However, they do find it easy, and they do reach a better\nconsensus, if they are required to indicate some part of the spectrum they would\ncall typically orange, typically blue, or typically green. That is, they have con-\nsistent and uniform ideas about \u2018typical\u2019 colors. Speakers of different languages\nexhibit such behavior, always provided that the appropriate color terms are in\ntheir languages. As we will see in the following section, we can use this idea that\npeople can and do classify in such a way to propose still another approach to\nrelating language and culture.\nDiscussion\n1. Try to account for the often reported finding that, for English at least, males\nusually display less ability than females in dealing with matters having to\ndo with color, including the actual use of color terminology.\n2. What are some of the more esoteric color designations you have encoun-\ntered recently? Where did you find them? Who used them? What appears\nto be their purpose?\n3. Two other naturally occurring phenomena capable of sub-division are years\nand days. How is each divided? Be careful since systems of division may\nAITC09 236 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 237\ndepend on a variety of factors: geographical, climatic, religious, academic,\nand so on. Note that in each case, unlike the color spectrum, there is a need\nto choose an arbitrary beginning (or end) point.\nPrototypes\nRosch (1976) has proposed an alternative to the view that concepts are com-\nposed from sets of features which necessarily and sufficiently define instances of\na concept. Rosch proposes that concepts are best viewed as prototypes: a \u2018bird\u2019\nis not best defined by reference to a set of features that refer to such matters as\nwings, warm-bloodedness, and egg-laying characteristics, but rather by reference\nto typical instances, so that a \u2018prototypical bird\u2019 is something more like a robin\nthan it is like a toucan, penguin, ostrich, or even eagle. This is the theory of\nprototypes. As we saw in the preceding section, individuals do have ideas of\ntypical instances of colors, and these ideas are remarkably similar among vari-\nous cultural groups. Such similarity in views, however, is found not only in\nreference to birds and colors.\nA variety of experiments has shown that people do in fact classify quite\nconsistently objects of various kinds according to what they regard as being\ntypical instances; for example, (1) furniture, so that, whereas a chair is a typical\nitem of furniture, an ashtray is not; (2) fruit, so that, whereas apples and plums\nare typical, coconuts and olives are not; and (3) clothing, so that, whereas coats\nand trousers are typical items, things like bracelets and purses are not (Clark\nand Clark, 1977, p. 464). The remarkably uniform behavior that people exhibit\nin such tasks cannot be accounted for by a theory which says that concepts are\nformed from sets of defining features. Such a theory fails to explain why some\ninstances are consistently held to be more typical or central than others when\nall exhibit the same set of defining features.\nHudson (1996, pp. 75\u20138) believes that prototype theory has much to offer\nsociolinguists. He believes it leads to an easier account of how people learn to\nuse language, particularly linguistic concepts, from the kinds of instances they\ncome across. He says (p. 77) that:\na prototype-based concept can be learned on the basis of a very small number of\ninstances \u2013 perhaps a single one \u2013 and without any kind of formal definition,\nwhereas a feature-based definition would be very much harder to learn since a\nmuch larger number of cases, plus a number of non-cases, would be needed before\nthe learner could work out which features were necessary and which were not.\nMoreover, such a view allows for a more flexible approach to understanding\nhow people actually use language. In that usage certain concepts are necessarily\n\u2018fuzzy,\u2019 as the theory predicts they will be, but that very fuzziness allowsspeakers\nto use language creatively.\nAccording to Hudson, prototype theory may even be applied to the social\nsituations in which speech occurs. He suggests that, when we hear a newlinguistic\nAITC09 237 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 238 Words and Culture\nitem, we associate with it who typically seems to use it and what, apparently,\nis the typical occasion of its use. Again, we need very few instances \u2013 even\npossibly just a single one \u2013 to be able to do this. Of course, if the particular\ninstance is atypical and we fail to recognize this fact, we could be in for some\ndiscomfort at a later time when we treat it as typical.\nPrototype theory, then, offers us a possible way of looking not only at how\nconcepts may be formed, i.e., at the cognitive dimensions of linguistic behavior,\nbut also at how we achieve our social competence in the use of language. We\njudge circumstances as being typically this or typically that, and we place\npeople in the same way. One person appears to be a \u2018typical\u2019 teacher, jock,\nburnout, teenager, or American, etc., while another does not. We then attempt\nto use language appropriate to the other as we perceive him or her and to the\nsituation we are in. As we will see in chapter 12, there is considerable merit to\nsuch an approach to attempting to understand how conversations, for example,\nproceed.\nDiscussion\n1. Which of the following are most and least typical instances of the initial\n\u2018concept\u2019 (and which might you even want to exclude): \u2018fruit\u2019 \u2013 apple,\ncoconut, plum, tomato, olive, strawberry, fig, banana, lemon, melon, pump-\nkin; \u2018game\u2019 \u2013 soccer, chess, golf, poker, hide-and-seek, boxing, horse-racing,\nbaseball, skiing, snakes-and-ladders; \u2018profession\u2019 \u2013 stockbroker, priest,under-\ntaker, soldier, dentist, photographer, boxer, politician, professor, lawyer;\n\u2018vegetable\u2019 \u2013 potato, carrot, pea, rhubarb, rice, spinach, watercress, tomato,\nmint, cabbage, beans, squash?\n2. Can you give some typical instances of each of the following and some not-\nso-typical instances: \u2018breakfast,\u2019 \u2018war movie,\u2019 \u2018party,\u2019 \u2018lecture,\u2019 \u2018assignment,\u2019\n\u2018request from a stranger for directions or for money,\u2019 and \u2018excuse\u2019?\n3. Can you explain how prototype theory offers some insight into why speak-\ners occasionally say such things as \u2018Technically, a whale is a mammal\u2019 or\n\u2018Strictly speaking, now that he\u2019s eighteen he\u2019s an adult\u2019?\nTaboo and Euphemism\nIn one sense this chapter has been about \u2018meaning,\u2019 specifically about how\ncultural meanings are expressed in language. But language is used to avoid\nsaying certain things as well as to express them. Certain things are not said, not\nbecause they cannot be, but because \u2018people don\u2019t talk about those things\u2019;\nor, if those things are talked about, they are talked about in very roundabout\nways. In the first case we have instances of linguistic taboo; in the second we\nhave the employment of euphemisms so as to avoid mentioning certain matters\ndirectly.\nAITC09 238 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 239\nTaboo is the prohibition or avoidance in any society of behavior believed to\nbe harmful to its members in that it would cause them anxiety, embarrassment,\nor shame. It is an extremely strong politeness constraint. Consequently, so far\nas language is concerned, certain things are not to be said or certain objects can\nbe referred to only in certain circumstances, for example, only by certain people,\nor through deliberate circumlocutions, i.e., euphemistically. Of course, there are\nalways those who are prepared to break the taboos in an attempt to show their\nown freedom from such social constraints or to expose the taboos as irrational\nand unjustified, as in certain movements for \u2018free speech.\u2019\nTabooed subjects can vary widely: sex; death; excretion; bodily functions;\nreligious matters; and politics. Tabooed objects that must be avoided or used\ncarefully can include your mother-in-law, certain game animals, and use of your\nleft hand (the origin of sinister). Crowley (1992, pp. 155\u20136) describes how in\nthe Kabana language of Papua New Guinea people typically have personal\nnames that also refer to everyday objects. However, there is also a strong restric-\ntion against saying the names of one\u2019s in-laws. What happens, therefore, when\nyou want to refer to the actual thing that your in-law is named after even\nthough you are not using the word as a personal name? For such cases the\nlanguage has a set of special words which are either words in the Kabana\nlanguage itself (but with different meanings) or words copied from neighbor-\ning languages with the same meanings. For example, the Kabana word for\na particular kind of fish is urae, so if your in-law is called Urae this fish must\nbe referred to as moi, the Kabana word for \u2018taro\u2019. The Kabana word for\n\u2018crocodile\u2019 is puaea but you cannot use this word if your in-law is called Puaea\nand you must refer to the crocodile as bagale, a borrowing from a neighboring\nlanguage.\nEnglish also has its taboos, and most people who speak English know what\nthese are and observe the \u2018rules.\u2019 When someone breaks the rules, that rupture\nmay arouse considerable comment, although not perhaps quite as much today\nas formerly, as when Shaw\u2019s use of bloody in Pygmalion or the use of damn in\nthe movie Gone with the Wind aroused widespread public comment. Standards\nand norms change. Linguistic taboos are also violated on occasion to draw\nattention to oneself, or to show contempt, or to be aggressive or provocative,\nor to mock authority \u2013 or, according to Freud, on occasion as a form of verbal\nseduction, e.g., \u2018talking dirty.\u2019 The penalty for breaking a linguistic taboo can\nbe severe, for blasphemy and obscenity are still crimes in many jurisdictions, but\nit is hardly likely to cost you your life, as the violation of certain non-linguistic\ntaboos, e.g., incest taboos, might in certain places in the world.\nHaas (1951) has pointed out that certain language taboos seem to arise from\nbilingual situations. She cites the examples of the Creeks of Oklahoma, whose\navoidance of the Creek words f\u00e1kki \u2018soil,\u2019 ap\u00edswa \u2018meat,\u2019 and ap\u00edssi \u2018fat\u2019increased\nas they used more and more English. A similar avoidance can sometimes be\nnoticed among Thai students learning English in English-speaking countries.\nThey avoid Thai words like fag \u2018sheath\u2019 and phrig \u2018(chili) pepper\u2019 in the presence\nof anglophones because of the phonetic resemblance of these words to certain\ntaboo English words. Thai speakers also often find it difficult to say the English\nwords yet and key because they sound very much like the Thai words jed, a\nAITC09 239 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 240 Words and Culture\nvulgar word for \u2018to have intercourse,\u2019 and kh\u00eei \u2018excrement.\u2019 In certain circum-\nstances, personal names may even be changed as a speaker of one language finds\nthat his or her name causes embarrassment in a different linguistic framework,\ne.g., the Vietnamese name Phuc in an anglophone group.\nThe late twentieth century may have seen a considerable change in regard\nto linguistic taboo \u2013 in the English-speaking world at least \u2013 as certain social\nconstraints have loosened. However, that decline may have been more than\nmatched by the marked increase in the use of euphemistic language, the \u2018dress-\ning up\u2019 in language of certain areas in life to make them more presentable, more\npolite, and more palatable to public taste. Euphemistic words and expressions\nallow us to talk about unpleasant things and disguise or neutralize the unpleas-\nantness, e.g., the subjects of sickness, death and dying, unemployment, and\ncriminality. They also allow us to give labels to unpleasant tasks and jobs in an\nattempt to make them sound almost attractive. Euphemism is endemic in our\nsociety: the glorification of the commonplace and the elevation of the trivial.\nWe are constantly renaming things and repackaging them to make them sound\n\u2018better\u2019; we must remember that Orwell\u2019s version of the future relied heavily\non characterizing the inhabitants of that future world as having fallen victim\nto its euphemisms, its renaming of reality to fit a new order of society. It is\neven possible to argue that \u2018politically correct\u2019 language is euphemism in a new\nguise.\nIn a series of publications Nadel (particularly 1954) has described how the\nNupe of West Africa must be among the most prudish people in the world, dis-\ntinguishing sharply between expressions that are suitable for polite conversation\nand those that are not. They constantly resort to circumlocutions and euphem-\nisms in order to avoid direct mention of matters pertaining to parts of the body,\nbodily functions, sex, and so on. At the same time, however, they show an\nintense fascination with language and are prepared to discuss various linguistic\ncomplexities at length. It seems that they are quite aware of what they are doing\nwhen they use circumlocutions and euphemisms. As Nadel says (p. 57), \u2018When\nthey employ metaphors or otherwise manipulate expressions, they are always\nfully aware of the semantic implications.\u2019 Apparently, the Nupe have developed\nindirect ways of referring to tabooed matters, ways they can employ on those\noccasions when it is possible to free themselves from normal constraints, e.g.,\nin certain kinds of story-telling or on specific festive occasions.\nTaboo and euphemism affect us all. We may not be as deeply conscious of the\neffects as are the Nupe, but affect us they do. We all probably have a few things\nwe refuse to talk about and still others we do not talk about directly. We may\nhave some words we know but never \u2013 or hardly ever \u2013 use because they are\ntoo emotional for either us or others. While we may find \u2018some thoughts too\ndeep for words\u2019 \u2013 something hard to prove \u2013 others we definitely take care not\nto express at all even though we know the words, or else we express ourselves\non them very indirectly. Each social group is different from every other in how\nit constrains linguistic behavior in this way, but constrain it in some such way\nit certainly does. Perhaps one linguistic universal is that no social group uses\nlanguage quite uninhibitedly. If so, it would be intriguing to hypothesize why\nthis is the case. What useful function does such inhibition serve?\nAITC09 240 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM Words and Culture 241\nDiscussion\n1. Death and dying is still a heavily tabooed area in Western life. Show that\nthis is the case by finding out what words are avoided? What euphemisms\ndo you find? Good sources of data are obituary notices and almost anything\nthat comes from the various people whose occupation it is to arrange for\nthe disposal of the dead.\n2. All of the following expressions can be said to be euphemistic: pest con-\ntrol officer; building engineer; comfort station; socially deviant behavior;\nseasonal adjustment in employment; culturally deprived children. Try to\nexplain why such expressions arise. Do they have any useful social function\nto perform? Do you know any other similar expressions?\n3. Do taboo and euphemism serve any socially useful purpose? Or are they\njust \u2018relics of the Dark Ages\u2019?\n4. Is there a useful distinction to be made between \u2018euphemistic\u2019 language and\n\u2018politically correct\u2019 language?\nFurther Reading\nSome basic books on language and culture are Foley (1997), Duranti (1997),\nShaul and Furbee (1998), and Brenneis and Macaulay (1996). See Lucy (1992a),\nLee (1996), Gumperz and Levinson (1996), and P\u00fctz and Verspoor (2000) for\nmore on the linguistic relativity hypothesis. A basic collection of Whorf\u2019s writ-\nings is Carroll (1956). There is an extensive literature on kinship systems,\ne.g., Tyler (1969); Burling (1970) provides a good brief introduction. Hudson\n(1996) discusses prototype theory and Blount (1995) and Tsohatzidis (1990) are\nuseful collections of papers. Berlin and Kay (1969) is a basic source for color\nterminology. Taboo and euphemism are also widely discussed: Farb (1974)\nand Mencken (1919) are well worth consulting. See Lakoff and Johnson (1980)\non metaphors we live by.\nThe Journal of Linguistic Anthropology is a useful publication.\nAITC09 241 5\/9\/05, 4:31 PM 242 Ethnographies\n10 Ethnographies\nSpeech is used in different ways among different groups of people. As we will\nsee, each group has its own norms of linguistic behavior. A particular group may\nnot encourage talking for the sake of talking, and members of such a group may\nappear to be quite taciturn to outsiders who relish talk, or they may feel over-\nwhelmed by the demands made on them if those others insist on talking. In\ncontrast, in another group talk may be encouraged to the extent that it may\neven appear to be quite disorderly to an observer who has internalized a differ-\nent set of \u2018rules\u2019 for the conduct of talk. Listening to thunder or stones, as in\nthe Ojibwa examples mentioned earlier (see pp. 3\u20134), may appear to be bizarre,\neven to those who \u2018listen to their consciences\u2019 as a matter of course. We musttry\nto understand how different groups of people use their language (or languages)\nif we are to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how that language (or\nthose languages) is related to the society that uses it. A society that encourages\na wide variety of kinds of talk is likely to be rather different in many non-\nlinguistic ways from one in which speakers are expected neither to waste words\nnor to use words lightly. In this chapter, therefore, I will look at how we can\ntalk about the various ways in which people communicate with one another, in\nan attempt to see what factors are involved.\nHowever, I will also be concerned with the fact that much of that communica-\ntion is directed toward keeping an individual society going; that is, an important\nfunction of communication is social maintenance. Language is used to sustain\nreality. Consequently, a second purpose of this chapter is to look at ways in\nwhich individuals cooperate with one another to sustain the reality of everyday\nlife and at how they use language as one of the means to do so.\nVarieties of Talk\nIt is instructive to look at some of the ways in which various people in the world\nuse talk, or sometimes the absence of talk, i.e., silence, to communicate. For\nexample, Marshall (1961) has indicated how the !Kung, a bush-dwelling people\nof South West Africa, have certain customs which help them either to avoid or\nto reduce friction and hostility within bands and between bands. The !Kung lead\nAITC10 242 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 243\na very harsh life as hunters and gatherers, a life which requires a considerable\namount of cooperation and the companionship of a larger group if survival is\nto be guaranteed. Many of the customs of the !Kung support their social need\nfor cooperativeness and the individual need for personal acceptance. The !Kung\nare talkative people. Talk keeps communication open among them; it offers\nan emotional release; and it can also be used to alert individuals that they are\nstepping out of bounds, so heading off potentially dangerous conflicts between\nindividuals.\nThe !Kung talk about all kinds of things, but principally about food and gift-\ngiving. However, they avoid mentioning the names of their gods aloud, and men\nand women do not openly discuss sexual matters together. Such subjects aretaboo.\nThey have their own styles of joking, and story-telling, but, in the latter case,\nthey do not \u2018make up\u2019 stories, finding no interest at all in that activity. They\nhave one kind of talk to resolve disputes; another, which Marshall calls a \u2018shout,\u2019\nto resolve the kinds of tension that arise when some sudden, dangerous event\noccurs, such as the burning down of a grass hut in a village; and still another,a\nrepetitive trance-like type of speech, to indicate a feeling of some kind of depriva-\ntion concerning food. According to Marshall, speech among the !Kung helps to\nmaintain peaceful social relationships by allowing people to keep in touch with\none another about how they are thinking and feeling. It helps the !Kung torelieve\ntheir tensions, and it prevents pressures from building up and finding their\nrelease in aggression.\nWe can contrast the need the !Kung have to talk in order to ensure that\ntensions do not build up with the Western Apache view of silence (Basso, 1972).\nWhereas the !Kung speak to prevent uncertainty in human relationships, theWest-\nern Apache of east-central Arizona choose to be silent when there is a strong\npossibility that such uncertainty exists. They are silent on \u2018meeting strangers,\u2019\nwhether these are fellow Western Apache or complete outsiders; and strangers,\ntoo, are expected to be silent. The Western Apache do not easily enter into new\nsocial relationships, and silence is deemed appropriate to a new relationship,\nbecause such a relationship is felt to be inherently uncertain.\nChildren returning from government boarding schools are greeted with sil-\nence and the children themselves are expected to be silent. Silence is maintained\nuntil each person once again becomes accustomed to the presence of the others.\nWhen one is \u2018cussed out,\u2019 i.e., disciplined verbally, silence is again the appro-\npriate response, even though the cussing out may be undeserved; the Western\nApache believe that responding will make matters worse. The initial stages of\ncourting behavior also require silence; in this case, silence is taken to be a proper\nindication of the shyness that is expected between two people attempting to\nenter into a close relationship. They regard talkativeness in such a situation,\nespecially in the female of the pair, as immodest.\nSilence is also used as a kind of sympathizing device after someone dies: you\nare silent in the presence of \u2018people who are sad,\u2019 and you should not further\ndisturb those who are already disturbed by grief. Silence is also required during\ncuring ceremonials if you are not to be considered disrespectful or to be inter-\nfering either with the curing process or with the person conducting theceremonial.\nAccording to Basso, the Western Apache resort to silence when they areconfronted\nAITC10 243 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 244 Ethnographies\nwith ambiguity and uncertainty in their social relationships: they do not try to\ntalk their way out of difficulty or uncertainty as people with other cultural\nbackgrounds sometimes try to do.\nSilence is often communicative and its appropriate uses must be learned.Among\nother things it can communicate respect, comfort, support, disagreement, or\nuncertainty. In many societies people do not talk unless they have something\nimportant to say. As Gardner (1966) has observed, the Puliyanese of south India\nare neither particularly cooperative nor competitive, and individuals tend to do\ntheir own thing. They do not find much to talk about, and by the time they are\n40 or so they hardly seem to talk at all. The Aritama of Colombia are described\nas being not only taciturn, but also, when they do speak, deliberately evasive.\nSeveral reports have recounted how Danes appreciate silence, being able to sit\nin one another\u2019s presence for long periods of time without feeling any need to\ntalk and, indeed, finding visitors who insist on talking constantly too demand-\ning. They feel no urge to fill up silences with idle chatter. In other societies, e.g.,\namong certain aboriginal peoples in North America, an acceptable social visit\nis to arrive at someone\u2019s house, sit around for a while, and then leave with\nhardly a word spoken all the while. If you have nothing to say, you do not need\nto speak, and there is no obligation to make \u2018small talk.\u2019\nIn contrast, other people talk for the sheer pleasure of talking. Fox (1974) has\ndescribed how the Roti, the residents of the southwestern tip of the island of\nTimor in eastern Indonesia, consider talk one of the great pleasures of life \u2013 not\njust idle chatter, but disputing, arguing, showing off various verbal skills, and,\nin general, indulging in verbal activity. Silence is interpreted as a sign of some\nkind of distress, possibly confusion or dejection. So social encounters are talk-\nfilled. The Bella Coola of British Columbia are said to talk constantly and to\nprize wittiness. Among the Araucanians of Chile the men take great pride intheir\noratorical skills, but women maintain silence in the presence of their husbands.\nEven communities located physically quite near each other can be quite differ-\nent in this respect. In his Laws, Plato described how the Athenians were great\ntalkers whereas the Spartans were known for their brevity and the Cretans were\nreputed to have more wit than words.\nThe social situation in Antigua in the West Indies requires another kind of\nindulgence in talk. Talk is expected of people. Reisman (1974, p. 113) describes\nwhat happens when someone enters a casual group:\nno opening is necessarily made for him; nor is there any pause or other formal\nsignal that he is being included. No one appears to pay any attention. When\nhe feels ready he will simply begin speaking. He may be heard, he may not.\nThat is, the other voices may eventually stop and listen, or some of them may\nnot; eyes may or may not turn to him. If he is not heard the first time he will try\nagain, and yet again (often with the same remark). Eventually he will be heard or\ngive up.\nIn such a system it is also true that there is no particular reason to find out what\nis going on or who is talking before one starts oneself. There is little pressure to\nrelate one\u2019s subject to any state of the group. Therefore it is also quite reasonable\nto arrive talking, so to speak, and the louder one does so the greater the chances\nthat one is heard.\nAITC10 244 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 245\nIn Antigua a conversation is multi-faceted in that it freely mixes a variety of\nactivities that in certain other groups would be kept quite apart. Reisman points\nout (p. 114) how, \u2018in a brief conversation with me, about three minutes, a girl\ncalled to someone on the street, made a remark to a small boy, sang a little, told\na child to go to school, sang some more, told a child to go buy bread, etc., all\nthe while continuing the thread of her conversation about her sister.\u2019 In Antigua\npeople speak because they must assert themselves through language. They do\nnot consider as interruptions behavior that we would consider to be either\ninterruptive or even disruptive. Reisman says (p. 115) that in Antigua \u2018to enter\na conversation one must assert one\u2019s presence rather than participate in some-\nthing formalized as an exchange.\u2019 In a restaurant or store:\none says aloud what one wants, nobody asks you. Neither is any sign given that\nyour request has been heard. If you feel your request is not getting attention you\nmay repeat it (how often depending on your character, how big a noise you like\nto make generally). But one must not assume in the remarks one makes that one\nhas not been heard the first time or one will be rebuked. One is listened to.\nTalk in Antigua is therefore quite a different kind of activity from talk in\nDenmark. Nor can one kind be said to be \u2018better\u2019 than the other. Each arises\nfrom certain needs in the society and each responds to those needs.\nAs a final example of another special use of languages, I can mention the\nimportance of a certain kind of talk among the Subanun of the Philippines, who\nemploy certain kinds of speech in drinking encounters. Such encounters are very\nimportant for gaining prestige and for resolving disputes. Frake (1964) has\ndescribed how talk, what he calls \u2018drinking talk,\u2019 proceeds in such encounters,\nfrom the initial invitation to partake of drink, to the selection of the propertopics\nfor discussion and problems for resolution as drinking proceeds competitively,\nand finally to the displays of verbal art that accompany heavy, \u2018successful\u2019\ndrinking. Each of these stages has its own characteristics. Those who are the\nmost accomplished at drinking talk become the de facto leaders among the\nSubanun because successful talk during drinking may be used to claim or assert\nsocial leadership. It gives one a certain right to manipulate others, because it is\nduring such talk that important disputes are settled, e.g., disputes which in other\nsocieties would have to be settled in the courts. Drinking talk among the Subanun\nis therefore far removed from \u2018cocktail party chatter,\u2019 as many Westerners know\nthe latter: it is serious business.\nI have used these various examples to provide some insight into how speech,\nor talk, is used in certain societies very differently from the ways we might be\naccustomed to hearing it used. Those ways, of course, derive entirely from the\nnorms we have internalized or from others with which we have become familiar.\nWe should be prepared to acknowledge that some of our own uses of language\nwould undoubtedly strike a !Kung, a Western Apache, an Antiguan, or a Subanun\nas strange, if not bizarre. Just think how often we talk about the weather but\nto no consequence! What we need is some kind of general scheme, or frame-\nwork, to help us make systematic observations about the different ways people\nuse talk. In the next section we will consider such a framework.\nAITC10 245 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 246 Ethnographies\nDiscussion\n1. From what I have said about the various peoples just mentioned, e.g., the\nRotinese, Western Apache, !Kung, Antiguans, and so on, we might predictthat\nchildren learn different ways of speaking in different societies. Samarinreports\n(1969, p. 323) that, among the Gbeya of the Central African Republic:\nGbeya parents and other adults focus little attention on the speech of children.\nNo serious attempt is made to improve their language. In fact, a child only\nuncommonly takes part in a dyadic speech event with an adult....Among the\nGbeya, \u2018children are seen and not heard.\u2019 Finally, there appears to be very\nlittle interest in reporting how a person speaks, particularly whenpsychological\nmotivations are implied.\nWe can contrast this kind of upbringing with the Anang of Nigeria (Mes-\nsenger, 1960, p. 229):\nThe Anang take great pride in their eloquence, and youth are trained from\nearly childhood to develop verbal skills. This proverb riddle instructs young\npeople to assume adult duties and responsibilities as early as possible, even if\ndoing so is difficult and unpleasant at times. As the vine must struggle to\nescape growing into the pit [the riddle], so must the child strive to overcome\nhis shyness and insecurity and learn to speak publicly, as well as perform other\nadult roles.\nHow would you describe your own linguistic upbringing in similar terms?\nDo you know others who have had a different kind of upbringing? Are\nthere any social or cognitive consequences to \u2018the way one learns to speak\u2019\nin this broad sense?\n2. Is there any justification for the claim that different ethnic and social groups\nin society sometimes exhibit quite different ways of speaking, even that a\nbilingual person may sometimes behave quite differently, depending on which\nlanguage he or she is using? If there are such differences, are there any\nconsequences for that society as a whole?\n3. In some speech communities there are special occasions and special places\nfor certain kinds of speech. Bauman (1972, pp. 340\u20131) has described such\na special place, the local store, for people in a community in Nova Scotia:\nWhat is apparently going on in the culture of the La Have Islanders is that,\nwithin the whole range of speech situations making up the speech economy\nof the islanders, the session at the store is singled out as special, isolated from\nthe others and enjoyed for its own sake, because talking there may be enjoyed\nfor its own sake and not as a part of another activity or for some instrumental\npurpose. In other words, the fact that this situation is set aside for sociability,\npure and simple, makes it special.\nDo you know of any equivalent occasions or places within your own social\ngroup? Or any occasions or places in which \u2018normal rules\u2019 are suspended?\nAITC10 246 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 247\n4. The Subanun have prescribed rituals they follow for correct \u2018drinking\u2019\nbehavior. What rituals do we observe when we dine out, e.g., at an elegant\nrestaurant or at a formal banquet?\n5. Exchanging greetings with others seems to be an unremarkable activity.\nHowever, once you begin to ask questions about what is happening you\ndiscover that it may not be so unremarkable after all. Why speak at all?\nWhen do you greet others? Who do you greet? Who speaks first? What can\n(and cannot) be said? What else is involved in an exchange of greetings?\nThe Ethnography of Speaking\nHymes (1974) has proposed an ethnographic framework which takes intoaccount\nthe various factors that are involved in speaking. An ethnography of a communi-\ncative event is a description of all the factors that are relevant in understanding\nhow that particular communicative event achieves its objectives. Forconvenience,\nHymes uses the word SPEAKING as an acronym for the various factors he\ndeems to be relevant. We will now consider these factors one by one.\nThe Setting and Scene (S) of speech are important. Setting refers to the time\nand place, i.e., the concrete physical circumstances in which speech takes place.\nScene refers to the abstract psychological setting, or the cultural definition of the\noccasion. The Queen\u2019s Christmas message has its own unique setting and scene,\nas has the President of the United States\u2019 annual State of the Union Address. A\nparticular bit of speech may actually serve to define a scene, whereas another\nbit of speech may be deemed to be quite inappropriate in certain circumstances.\nWithin a particular setting, of course, participants are free to change scenes, as\nthey change the level of formality (e.g., go from serious to joyful) or as they\nchange the kind of activity in which they are involved (e.g., begin to drink or\nto recite poetry).\nThe Participants (P) include various combinations of speaker\u2013listener,\naddressor\u2013addressee, or sender\u2013receiver. They generally fill certain socially speci-\nfied roles. A two-person conversation involves a speaker and hearer whose roles\nchange; a \u2018dressing down\u2019 involves a speaker and hearer with no role change;\na political speech involves an addressor and addressees (the audience); and a\ntelephone message involves a sender and a receiver. A prayer obviously makes\na deity a participant. In a classroom a teacher\u2019s question and a student\u2019sresponse\ninvolve not just those two as speaker and listener but also the rest of the class\nas audience, since they too are expected to benefit from the exchange.\nEnds (E) refers to the conventionally recognized and expected outcomes of an\nexchange as well as to the personal goals that participants seek to accomplishon\nparticular occasions. A trial in a courtroom has a recognizable social end inview,\nbut the various participants, i.e., the judge, jury, prosecution, defense, accused,\nand witnesses, have different personal goals. Likewise, a marriage ceremony\nserves a certain social end, but each of the various participants may have his or\nher own unique goals in getting married or in seeing a particular couplemarried.\nAITC10 247 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 248 Ethnographies\nAct sequence (A) refers to the actual form and content of what is said: the\nprecise words used, how they are used, and the relationship of what is said to\nthe actual topic at hand. This is one aspect of speaking in which linguists have\nlong shown an interest, particularly those who study discourse andconversa-\ntion, and it is one about which I will have more to say in chapter 12. Otherstoo,\ne.g., psychologists and communication theorists concerned with contentanalysis,\nhave shown a similar interest. Public lectures, casual conversations, and cocktail\nparty chatter are all different forms of speaking; with each go different kinds of\nlanguage and things talked about.\nKey (K), the fifth term, refers to the tone, manner, or spirit in which a par-\nticular message is conveyed: light-hearted, serious, precise, pedantic, mocking,\nsarcastic, pompous, and so on. The key may also be marked nonverbally bycertain\nkinds of behavior, gesture, posture, or even deportment. When there is a lackof\nfit between what a person is actually saying and the key that the person is using,\nlisteners are likely to pay more attention to the key than to the actual content,\ne.g., to the burlesque of a ritual rather than to the ritual itself.\nInstrumentalities (I) refers to the choice of channel, e.g., oral, written, or tele-\ngraphic, and to the actual forms of speech employed, such as the language,dialect,\ncode, or register that is chosen. Formal, written, legal language is one instru-\nmentality; spoken Newfoundland English is another; code-switching between\nEnglish and Italian in Toronto is a third; and the use of Pig Latin is still another.\nIn Suriname a high government official addresses a Bush Negro chief in Dutch\nand has his words translated into the local tribal language. The chief does the\nopposite. Each speaks this way although both could use a commoninstrumental-\nity, Sranan. You may employ different instrumentalities in the course of a single\nverbal exchange of some length: first read something, then tell a dialect joke,then\nquote Shakespeare, then use an expression from another language, and so on.\nYou also need not necessarily change topic to do any of these.\nNorms of interaction and interpretation (N) refers to the specific behaviors\nand properties that attach to speaking and also to how these may be viewed by\nsomeone who does not share them, e.g., loudness, silence, gaze return, and so\non. For example, there are certain norms of interaction with regard to church\nservices and conversing with strangers. However, these norms may vary from\nsocial group to social group, so the kind of behavior expected in congregations\nthat practice \u2018talking in tongues\u2019 or the group encouragement of a preacher in\nothers would be deemed abnormal and unacceptable in a \u2018high\u2019 Anglican set-\nting. Likewise, an Arab and an Anglo-Saxon meeting for the first time are\nunlikely to find a conversational distance that each finds comfortable.\nGenre (G), the final term, refers to clearly demarcated types of utterance; such\nthings as poems, proverbs, riddles, sermons, prayers, lectures, and editorials.These\nare all marked in specific ways in contrast to casual speech. Of course, in the\nmiddle of a prayer, a casual aside would be marked too. While particular genres\nseem more appropriate on certain occasions than on others, e.g., sermons in-\nserted into church services, they can be independent: we can ask someone\nto stop \u2018sermonizing\u2019; that is, we can recognize a genre of sermons when an\ninstance of it, or something closely resembling an instance, occurs outside its\nusual setting.\nAITC10 248 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 249\nWhat Hymes offers us in his SPEAKING formula is a very necessary reminder\nthat talk is a complex activity, and that any particular bit of talk is actually a\npiece of \u2018skilled work.\u2019 It is skilled in the sense that, if it is to be successful, the\nspeaker must reveal a sensitivity to and awareness of each of the eight factors\noutlined above. Speakers and listeners must also work to see that nothing goes\nwrong. When speaking does go wrong, as it sometimes does, that going-wrong\nis often clearly describable in terms of some neglect of one or more of thefactors.\nSince we acknowledge that there are \u2018better\u2019 speakers and \u2018poorer\u2019 speakers, we\nmay also assume that individuals vary in their ability to manage and exploit the\ntotal array of factors.\nEthnographies are based on first-hand observations of behavior in a group of\npeople in their natural setting. Investigators report on what they see and hear\nas they observe what is going on around them. As Duranti (1997, p. 85) says,\n\u2018an ethnography is the written description of the social organization, social\nactivities, symbolic and material resources, and interpretive practices character-\nistic of a particular group of people.\u2019 Ethnographers ask themselves what is\nhappening and they try to provide accounts which show how the behavior that\nis being observed makes sense within the community that is being observed. As\nJohnstone (2004, p. 76) says, ethnography \u2018presupposes...that the best explan-\nations of human behavior are particular and culturally relative\u2019 rather than\ngeneral and universal. Such studies are also qualitative rather than quantitative.\nIn ethnographies of speaking the focus is on the language the participants are\nusing and the cultural practices such language reflects. They very often deal with\nissues of identity and power.\nThree illustrative book-length ethnographic studies are those of Sherzer (1983),\nHill and Hill (1986), and Lindenfeld (1990). Sherzer describes how the Kuna of\nPanama use language: their public language of the gathering house, and their\nuse of language in curing and music, in rites and festivities, and in everyday con-\nversation. He points out that the Kuna wait very patiently to take their turns\nin speaking so that interruptions and overlaps in conversation are rare events.\nHill and Hill describe how the Malinche of Central Mexico use language in their\ndaily lives and continuing struggle, and Lindenfeld offers an account of the\nlanguage of a dozen long-standing urban marketplaces in Paris, Rouen, and\nGrenoble: the talk of vendors, vendor\u2013customer talk, politeness routines, small\ntalk, jokes, insults, etc. She shows how such talk helps to sustain the markets\nas places where goods are bought and sold while at the same time allowing\npeople to associate with one another, an important function in an increasingly\nurbanizing society in which interpersonal relationships appear to be difficult to\nmaintain.\nHazen\u2019s (2002) study of speech in Warren County, North Carolina, required\na year and a half of residence in the community as well as visits over a seven-\nyear period. This participation in the community enabled Hazen to look closely\nat factors affecting the cultural identity of residents and their expression of that\nidentity through linguistic choices. He looked at three local groups (African\nAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans) and whether speakers\nidentified only with Warren County or with both Warren County and areas\noutside the county. He called this their cultural identity. Hazen concludes that\nAITC10 249 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 250 Ethnographies\nwhile \u2018linguistic variation in Warren County correlates with several categories,\nincluding gender, age, and ethnicity...the cultural identity of speakers should\nbe considered for both large-scale studies of social factors and more ethno-\ngraphic studies of individual speakers\u2019 (p. 253). Cultural identity \u2013 a qualitative\nfactor \u2013 turned out to be the one that most clearly accounted for the linguistic\nbehaviors that Hazen observed. (The studies by Gal (see pp. 205\u20136), the Milroys\n(pp. 181\u20133), Eckert (p. 212), Kiesling (p. 177), and Marshall (p. 211) also have\nmajor ethnographic components.)\nAn alternative approach to devising ethnographies is to attempt to describe\nthe different functions of language in communication. Various linguists have\nproposed different categorizations of the functions of language, e.g., Jakobson\n(1960), Halliday (1973), and Robinson (1972). Halliday\u2019s list covers thefollowing\nfunctions: instrumental (satisfying some material need); regulatory (regulating\nthe behavior of people); interactional (maintaining social relationships);personal\n(expressing personality); heuristic (investigating the environment); imaginative\n(playing and creating); and representational (expressing propositions). Robinson\u2019s\nlist (pp. 50\u20131) covers many of the same functions but names them differently\nand, of course, divides them differently: avoidance, conformity to norms,aesthetics,\nencounter regulation, performative, regulation (of self and others), affective,\nmarking of emitter (e.g., emotional state, personality, or identity), role relation-\nship marking, referential, instruction, inquiry, and metalanguage functions.\nWhat is clear from any such list is that there is more to understanding how\nlanguage is used than describing the syntactic composition of sentences or\nspecifying their propositional content. When you learn to use a language, you\nlearn how to use it in order to do certain things that people do with thatlanguage.\nThe term communicative competence is sometimes used to describe this kind of\nability. Gumperz (1972, p. 205) explains that term as follows: \u2018Whereas lin-\nguistic competence covers the speaker\u2019s ability to produce grammatically correct\nsentences, communicative competence describes his ability to select, from the\ntotality of grammatically correct expressions available to him, forms which\nappropriately reflect the social norms governing behavior in specific encounters.\u2019\nWorking with an ethnographic or functional approach, we may attempt to\nspecify just what it means to be a competent speaker of a particular language.\nIt is one thing to learn the language of the Subanun, but quite another to learn\nhow to ask for a drink in Subanun. To do the first you need a certain linguistic\ncompetence; to do the latter you need communicative competence. As Saville-\nTroike (1996, p. 363) says:\nCommunicative competence extends to both knowledge and expectation of who\nmay or may not speak in certain settings, when to speak and when to remain\nsilent, whom one may speak to, how one may talk to persons of different statuses\nand roles, what nonverbal behaviors are appropriate in various contexts, what\nthe routines for turn-taking are in conversation, how to ask for and give informa-\ntion, how to request, how to offer or decline assistance or cooperation, how to\ngive commands, how to enforce discipline, and the like \u2013 in short, everything\ninvolving the use of language and other communicative dimensions in particular\nsocial settings.\nAITC10 250 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 251\nHymes (1972, p. 279) has argued that, in learning a language, children\nmust learn not only how to construct sentences in that language but also must\n\u2018acquire knowledge of a set of ways in which sentences are used. From a finite\nexperience of speech acts and their interdependence with sociocultural features,\nthey develop a general theory of the speaking appropriate in their community,\nwhich they employ, like other forms of tacit cultural knowledge (competence),in\nconducting and interpreting social life.\u2019 Hymes provides some examples of the\nkinds of learning that are involved:\nThey come to be able to recognize, for example, appropriate and inappropriate\ninterrogative behavior (e.g., among the Araucanians of Chile, that to repeat a\nquestion is to insult; among the Tzeltal of Chiapas, Mexico, that a direct question\nis not properly asked (and to be answered \u2018nothing\u2019); among the Cahinahua of\nBrazil, that a direct answer to a first question implies that the answerer has not\ntime to talk, a vague answer, that the question will be answered directly the second\ntime, and that talk can continue).\nAnother often-cited example is the different ways in which American and\nJapanese children are indoctrinated into appropriate language use (see Tobin etal.,\n1989). In contrast to the American encouragement of individual assertiveness\nthe Japanese favor developing social awareness and \u2018harmony.\u2019 A misbehaving\nJapanese child will be told hito ni warawareru \u2018you\u2019ll be laughed at by others\u2019\nand instructed in polite ways of declining and, especially, of avoiding categorical\nrefusals. Such behavior is appropriate within Japanese culture and it is learned\nvery early in life.\nIn learning to speak we are also learning to \u2018talk,\u2019 in the sense of communi-\ncating in those ways appropriate to the group in which we are doing thatlearning.\nThese ways differ from group to group; consequently, as we move from one\ngroup to another or from one language to another, we must learn the new ways\nif we are to fit into that new group or to use that new language properly. Com-\nmunicative competence is therefore a key component of social competence.\nDiscussion\n1. Explain how considerations of when and how are deeply involved in doing\neach of the following: giving bad news; asking for a date (or a loan); leaving\na party rather early; changing your mind about something important; and\nbreaking off a relationship.\n2. Part of the deliberate instruction we give to children about language is\ninstruction in when and how it is appropriate to speak and when you\nshould not speak at all: e.g., \u2018Don\u2019t talk to strangers\u2019; \u2018Say \u201cThank you\u201d\u2019;\nand \u2018Keep your voice down.\u2019 Find some other examples.\n3. Question-and-answer behavior is not as simple as it might appear to be.When\nare indirect questions preferred to direct ones, and vice versa? Must you\nalways answer a question? Can you insist on the answer? When is it appro-\npriate to ask for an answer to be repeated or for you to repeat another\u2019s\nAITC10 251 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 252 Ethnographies\nanswer? Are some questions not meant to be answered at all and to beentirely\nrhetorical? If so, what are these like? How do you recognize them as such?\nHow does the situation control the possibilities that exist for questioning?\n4. Your opportunity to respond positively, critically, or even at all to the speech\nof others is governed by circumstances. Are responses appropriate, and, if\nso, in what way, in the following circumstances: a judge\u2019s pre-sentencing\nremarks to someone who has just been convicted; a parent\u2019s \u2018dressing\ndown\u2019 of a child; a preacher\u2019s sermon to a congregation; a politician\u2019sspeech\nwhile electioneering; a pupil\u2019s reading aloud to a class; cheerleaders\u2019 calls to\nspectators; and a prime minister\u2019s or president\u2019s address to the nation to\nsomeone watching that address on television?\n5. Attempt to specify the essential defining characteristics of each of the fol-\nlowing bits of behavior, focusing specifically on the linguistic characteristics:\ngossiping; heckling; making a speech; giving a poetry reading; passing the\ntime of day; refereeing; debating; and preaching.\nEthnomethodology\nWhile it is possible to investigate talk, the various factors that enter into it, and\nthe variety of its functions, and make many sound observations, this does not\nby any means exhaust all we might want to say on the subject. As indicated at\nthe beginning of the chapter, talk itself is also used to sustain reality and is itself\npart of that reality. We can therefore look at talk as a phenomenon in its own\nright. Ethnomethodology is that branch of sociology which is concerned, among\nother things, with talk viewed in this way.\nEthnomethodologists are interested in the processes and techniques that\npeople use to interpret the world around them and to interact with that world.\nThey are interested in trying to discover the categories and systems that peopleuse\nin making sense of the world. Therefore, they do not conduct large-scale surveys\nof populations, devise sophisticated theoretical models of social organization,\nor hypothesize that some social theory or other will adequately explain social\norganization. Instead, they focus on the phenomena of everyday existence,actually\non various bits and pieces of it, in an attempt to show how those who must deal\nwith such bits and pieces go about doing so. As Leiter (1980, p. 5) states, \u2018the\naim of ethnomethodology...is to study the processes of sense making(idealizing\nand formulizing) that members of society...use to construct the social world\nand its factual properties (its sense of being ready-made and independent of\nperception).\u2019 Another view is that of Fairclough (1989, p. 9):\nEthnomethodologists investigate the production and interpretation of everyday action\nas skilled accomplishments of social factors, and they are interested in conversation\nas one particularly pervasive instance of skilled social action.\nEthnomethodologists are interested in such matters as how people interact, solve\ncommon problems, maintain social contacts, perform routine activities, andshow\nAITC10 252 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 253\nthat they know what is going on around them and communicate that knowledge\nto others.\nWe can use a simple linguistic example to show that we cannot hope to\nunderstand others if we do not share certain background assumptions with\nthose others. Only when there is such sharing is communication possible. In\nunpublished work, Sacks gives the following example of a two-sentencesequence\nto illustrate this point: \u2018The baby cried. The mommy picked it up.\u2019 How do we\nunderstand these two sentences from a child? How do they communicate? We\nunderstand that mommy in the second sentence refers to the mother of baby in\nthe first, but there is nothing in the structure of the sentences themselves to tell\nus this. All we have is a connection between baby and mommy achieved through\nmention in successive sentences. Sacks claims that in such cases there are what\nhe calls membership categorization devices which allow us to assign certain\nmeanings to words like baby and mommy. In this case, we put the words into\na set like baby, mommy, daddy rather than one like baby, child, adult; con-\nsequently, we understand that it is the baby\u2019s mother who is involved in the\nsecond sentence.\nNote that we interpret the following relationship quite differently: \u2018The baby\ncried. The adult picked it up.\u2019 One assumption we apparently share with others\nwho use such sentences (and with the child who used the original pair) is that\nthe world is ordered in such a way that there are certain categories of relation-\nships that are expressed through language. To interpret particular sentences or\nsets of sentences, we must have some knowledge of the categories that speakers\nfind relevant (Sacks, 1972a, 1972b). This knowledge of membership categoriza-\ntion devices is socially acquired. It is also the kind of knowledge in which\nethnomethodologists are interested.\nWe constantly use such categorizations. They are not unlike labels such as\n\u2018jocks\u2019 and \u2018burnouts\u2019 discussed earlier (p. 212) except that they tend to be\ncovert rather than overt. We constantly label people, places, and events around\nus and come to rely on such labels to help us deal with what is going on. Such\nlabeling systems must be learned. What exactly is a \u2018jock,\u2019 a \u2018convenience store,\u2019\na \u2018rave\u2019? \u2018Correct\u2019 labeling enables us to negotiate our way in society; \u2018incorrect\u2019\nlabeling is likely to lead to misunderstanding or possibly even to psychiatric\ncare. If X is indeed a jock and you have correctly identified him as such, you\nhave some idea of what to expect of each other. Misidentification in either\ndirection is likely to produce disorder. If both parties know what a convenience\nstore is and how people usually ask for and give directions, you may be directed\nto the nearest one. A late-night rave may be more difficult to find since it is both\na less widely known category and one often transient as to location.\nEthnomethodologists adopt what is called a phenomenological view of the\nworld; that is, the world is something that people must constantly keep creating\nand sustaining for themselves. In this view, language plays a very significant role\nin that creating and sustaining. Ethnomethodologists regard \u2018meaning\u2019 and\n\u2018meaningful activity\u2019 as something people accomplish when they interactsocially.\nThey focus on what people must do to make sense of the world around them,\nand not on what scientists do in trying to explain natural phenomena. Since\nmuch of human interaction is actually verbal interaction, they have focused\nAITC10 253 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 254 Ethnographies\nmuch of their attention on how people use language in their relationships to one\nanother. They have also focused on how in that use of language people employ\nwhat ethnomethodologists call commonsense knowledge and practicalreasoning.\nCommonsense knowledge refers to a variety of things. It is the understandings,\nrecipes, maxims, and definitions that we employ in daily living as we go about\ndoing things, e.g., knowing that thunder usually accompanies lightning; know-\ning how houses are usually laid out and lived in; knowing how to make a\ntelephone call; knowing that bus drivers do not take cheques; knowing thatthere\nare \u2018types\u2019 of people, objects, and events, e.g., students and professors, class-\nrooms and libraries, and lectures and laboratory sessions. These types help us\nto classify and categorize what is \u2018out there\u2019 and guide us in interpreting what\nhappens out there. This stock of commonsense knowledge is acquired through\nexperience; but since each person\u2019s experience is different from that of everyone\nelse, the knowledge varies from person to person. We also know that it varies,\nand that some people know more about certain things and others less. The stock\nitself is not systematic; in fact, it is quite heterogeneous, and often parts of it\nare inconsistent with other parts \u2013 at times even contradictory \u2013 but that fact\ndoes not usually prove very bothersome to most individuals. In particular circum-\nstances, we draw on the bits and pieces that seem useful; in other circumstances,\nwe look elsewhere in the stock for help and guidance.\nCommonsense knowledge also tells us that the world exists as a factualobject.\nThere is a world \u2018out there\u2019 independent of our particular existence; moreover,\nit is a world which others as well as ourselves experience, and we all experience\nit in much the same way. That world is also a consistent world. Situations and\nevents in it not only occur, they re-occur. Things do not change much from day\nto day. Knowledge acquired yesterday and the day before is still valid today and\nwill be valid tomorrow. We can take that world for granted, for our experience\ntells us it is there and so apparently does the experience of others. Philosophers\nmay question that reality, and psychologists may wonder how we can ever make\ncontact with what may be out there, but our experience of ordinary living raises\nnone of the same doubts in us. However, at any one time only bits and pieces\nof what is out there are relevant to our immediate concerns. We are not required\nto deal with everything all at once; rather, we must ignore what is irrelevant and\nfocus on what is immediately at issue.\nPractical reasoning refers to the way in which people make use of their com-\nmonsense knowledge and to how they employ that knowledge in their conduct\nof everyday life: what they assume; what they never question; how they select\nmatters to deal with; and how they make the various bits and pieces of com-\nmonsense knowledge fit together in social encounters so as to maintain \u2018normal\u2019\nappearances. It is quite different from logical thinking or the formation and\ntesting of scientific hypotheses, both of which we usually learn in formal settings\nand have very specialized goals.\nAs I have just observed, practical reasoning is not the same kind of thing as\nscientific reasoning. People do not think through the problems of everyday life\nthe same way that trained scientists go about solving problems. Scribner (1977),\nfor example, surveyed a number of pieces of research that looked at how people\nin different parts of the world reason. Evidently, people with very little or no\nAITC10 254 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 255\nformal education rely entirely on their own experience in solving problems and\ndo not, or cannot, employ \u2018logical\u2019 thinking. For example, a number of people\nin a rural tribe in Liberia in West Africa were presented with the following\nproblem:\nAll people who own houses pay a house tax.\nBoima does not pay a house tax.\nDoes Boima own a house?\nThe problem proved too difficult for many of the people asked, or, if they did\nmanage to solve it, they could not explain their reasoning. If they said, for\nexample, that Boima did not own a house, they might offer the explanation that\nit was because he was too poor to pay a house tax. This is not, of course, how\nthe above logical problem works, but is instead a practical commonsense inter-\npretation of the material contained within it and of the people\u2019s own experience\nwith house-owning and taxes, that is, with the realities of daily living.\nIn an interesting series of studies, Garfinkel (1972) showed how we conduct\nour everyday existence in ways that clearly demonstrate how we do not question\nthe kinds of assumptions mentioned above. He did this by creating situations in\nwhich his subjects, in this case his students, were not allowed to take certain\nthings for granted; rather, they were required to violate or to question matters\nwhich they would normally accept \u2018routinely.\u2019 Needless to say, language was\ninvolved in every case.\nFor example, Garfinkel asked his students to report a conversation and state\nhow the participants understood what they were talking about. To do so, it was\nnecessary not only to interpret what was actually said but also to contrast the\nsaid with the unsaid, i.e., that which was implied or that which could possibly\nbe inferred, and to make hypotheses about how the various bits and pieces of\nthe conversation fitted together as they did. Each party necessarily had to know\na lot about the other party, about the topic, and about the kind of exchange the\nconversation was; each also had to tolerate considerable inexplicitness in what\nwas actually said. For example, in part of one reported conversation between\na husband and wife, the wife\u2019s question, \u2018Did you take him [our son] to the\nrecord store?\u2019 leads to the following exchange with her husband (p. 4), with the\nwords actually spoken on the left and the husband\u2019s interpretation of these\nwords given on the right:\nHusband: No, to the shoe No, I stopped at the record store on the\nrepair shop. way to get him and stopped at the shoe\nrepair shop on the way home when he\nwas with me.\nWife: What for? I know of one reason why you might have\nstopped at the shoe repair shop. Why did\nyou in fact?\nHusband: I got some new As you will remember, I broke a shoe lace\nshoe laces for my on one of my brown oxfords the other\nshoes. day, so I stopped to get some new laces.\nAITC10 255 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 256 Ethnographies\nWife: Your loafers need Something else you could have gotten that\nnew heels badly. I was thinking of. You could have taken\nin your black loafers which need heels\nbadly. You\u2019d better get them taken care of\npretty soon.\nGarfinkel points out that in such exchanges matters not mentioned or only\npartially mentioned are still understood, that understanding itself develops as\nthe conversation develops, and that understanding depends on the willingness of\neach party to work with the other to develop a common scheme of interpreta-\ntion for what is being talked about. There is common agreement that we have\nto \u2018make sense\u2019 of what we hear. The shared assumption is that the participants\nare engaged in a \u2018normal\u2019 social interaction; that assumption will hold until they\nfind very strong contradictory evidence.\nWhen subjects were asked to take part in conversations and to insist that\nothers clarify casual remarks made in those circumstances, the usual reaction of\nthose others was one of either suspicion or hostility. Garfinkel cites (pp. 6\u20137)\ntwo cases that show these consequences quite clearly:\nCase 1\nS: Hi, Ray. How is your girl friend feeling?\nE: What do you mean, how is she feeling? Do you mean physical or mental?\nS: I mean how is she feeling? What\u2019s the matter with you? (He looked peeved.)\nE: Nothing. Just explain a little clearer what do you mean?\nS: Skip it. How are your Med School applications coming?\nE: What do you mean. How are they?\nS: You know what I mean.\nE: I really don\u2019t.\nS: What\u2019s the matter with you? Are you sick?\nCase 2\nOn Friday night my husband and I were watching television. My husbandremarked\nthat he was tired. I asked, \u2018How are you tired? Physically, mentally, or just bored?\u2019\nS: I don\u2019t know, I guess physically, mainly.\nE: You mean that your muscles ache, or your bones?\nS: I guess so. Don\u2019t be so technical.\n(After more watching.)\nS: All these old movies have the same kind of old iron bedstead in them.\nE: What do you mean? Do you mean all old movies, or some of them, or just\nthe ones you have seen?\nS: What\u2019s the matter with you? You know what I mean.\nE: I wish you would be more specific.\nS: You know what I mean! Drop dead!\nApparently, conversation proceeds on the assumption that a certain vaguenessis\nnormal, that ordinary talk does not require precision, and that manyexpressions\nAITC10 256 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 257\nthat are used in conversation are not to be taken literally. This vague, imprecise,\nand non-literal nature of ordinary talk is deemed to be entirely reasonable, and\nfor someone to question it is to act unreasonably.\nGarfinkel demonstrated this same non-literal quality in still another set of\nsituations in which subjects were asked to question things they normally did not\nquestion, that is, to refuse to accept either \u2018ordinary\u2019 appearances or \u2018ordinary\u2019\nuses. In this case, they were asked to behave as though the other person orpersons\nhad hidden motives; they were to seek these out and, to that extent, be dis-\ntrustful of others. This was not an easy task, because students found it difficult\nto sustain and carry through this distrustful attitude. One student asked a bus\ndriver constantly for reassurances that the bus would pass a certain street and\nreceived the following rebuke: \u2018Look lady, I told you once, didn\u2019t I? How many\ntimes do I have to tell you!\u2019 (p. 13).\nIn still another task, students were asked to perform as \u2018cultural dopes,\u2019 i.e.,\nto behave as if they were not aware of the social rules that pertained to specific\nsituations; for example, they were asked to try to bargain for standard-priced\nmerchandise. In this case, the greatest problem was that of making the initial\nmove; since you do not bargain for such merchandise, it is difficult to begin the\nbargaining process because it involves violating a rule of normative behavior.\nWhat many students found, though, was that, once this norm was violated, it\nwas possible to bargain in many cases, and that the actual bargaining could be\nboth enjoyable and rewarding (p. 25).\nWhat is apparent from these various reports is that much of what we take for\ngranted in our dealings with others depends on our accepting the appearances\nthose others try to project. In other words, we accept the world for what it is,\nand most of what we hear we accept in good faith, and what we doubt we may\nfind hard to confront openly. We accept certain norms; we realize that these vary\nfrom occasion to occasion so that different ones may apply in specific instances,\nbut norms do apply. It is our job to find or negotiate the ones appropriate to\nan occasion \u2013 in fact, it is everyone\u2019s job!\nEthnomethodologists have found that naturally occurring conversations pro-\nvide them with some of their most interesting data. Such conversations show\nhow individuals achieve common purposes by doing and saying certain things\nand not doing and saying others. They obey certain rules of cooperation, trust,\nturn-taking, and so on, and they usually do not confront others openly, doubt\nthem, insist they be always \u2018logical,\u2019 or refuse to do their own part in \u2018sustaining\nreality.\u2019 I will have more to say on such matters in chapter 12. For the moment\nit suffices to say that people use language not only to communicate in a variety\nof ways, but also to create a sense of order in everyday life.\nDiscussion\n1. Ethnomethodology is concerned with \u2018cultural know-how,\u2019 i.e., with what\npeople must know in order to survive in a culture. Explain what kinds of\n\u2018know-how\u2019 are involved in each of the following situations: being a student\nAITC10 257 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 258 Ethnographies\nor teacher in a classroom; buying an automobile; attending a wedding re-\nception or a funeral; declining an invitation; acting \u2018absentmindedly\u2019; flirting.\nFocus specifically on the linguistic aspects of this \u2018know-how.\u2019\n2. We all have a sense of the \u2018usual\u2019 and the \u2018normal\u2019 against which we judge\nthe \u2018unusual\u2019 and the \u2018abnormal.\u2019 What might mark each of the following\nas \u2018unusual\u2019 or \u2018abnormal\u2019: bad service in a restaurant; a bad day at the\noffice; strange behavior on the street; \u2018What\u2019s up with Fred today?\u2019; avant-\ngarde theater?\n3. Teachers and students must cooperate to sustain the \u2018reality\u2019 of the class-\nroom. What are some of the ways in which a teacher and a class that you\nknow cooperate? What particular patterns of behavior and types of lan-\nguage recur? If you have noticed any violations, how can these be described\nin terms of these recurrent patterns, i.e., what norms were violated?\n4. Gumperz (1972, p. 218) recounts the following joke originally told by a\nblack student to Gumperz\u2019s colleague, Alan Dundes:\nGovernor W. died and went to heaven. When he knocked on the door, a voice\nanswered: \u2018Who dat?\u2019 He said, \u2018Never mind, I\u2019ll go to the other place.\u2019\nUse whatever cultural \u2018know-how\u2019 you have to explain how this joke\nworks.\n5. One kind of cultural \u2018know-how\u2019 we assume that others have is a store of\nknowledge about people and places in the world, e.g., the Pope, J. F. Kennedy,\nthe Beatles, Napoleon, Grand Central Station, Paris, Hyde Park, and so on.\nOf course, we assume that different people have different stores. Do you\nremember any incidents in which you drew on what you thought was a\ncommon store of knowledge only to find that the other person did not\nknow what you were talking about? Have you ever been surprised to find\na large common store? Why is communication so much easier in the latter\ncase?\n6. Find some examples of linguistic \u2018know-how,\u2019 i.e., of things which it\nis apparently appropriate to say on specific occasions; for example, \u2018Excuse\nme, do you have a light?\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u2019 What were some com-\npletely inappropriate remarks that you either heard or used? Why were they\ninappropriate?\n7. What kinds of cultural and linguistic \u2018know-how\u2019 are necessary to do each\nof the following:\na. to telephone a movie theater to ask someone there if a parcel you left\nhas been retrieved?\nb. to get a malfunctioning household appliance fixed?\nc. to get a day off work (i) to go to the races, (ii) to go to a funeral, or\n(iii) to go for an interview for a position with a rival firm?\nd. to find out as much as you can about the English poet Isaac Rosenberg\n(1890\u20131918)?\nAITC10 258 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Ethnographies 259\nFurther Reading\nJohnstone (2000) provides an excellent introduction to the research methods\nof non-quantitative sociolinguistics. Agar (1996) is a useful introduction to\nethnography, and Saville-Troike (1989, 1996) are respectively book- and article-\nlength introductions to the ethnography of communication. Philipsen and Car-\nbaugh (1986) is a useful bibliography of ethnographic studies.\nBasic books on ethnomethodology are Heritage (1984), Leiter (1980), and\nTurner (1974). Cicourel (1973) provides another perspective. Button (1991),\nGarfinkel (1967), Psathas (1979), and Sudnow (1972) are collections of articles.\nSee Lepper (2000) for a discussion of categorization.\nAITC10 259 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 260 Solidarity and Politeness\n11 Solidarity and Politeness\nWhen we speak, we must constantly make choices of many different kinds: what\nwe want to say, how we want to say it, and the specific sentence types, words,\nand sounds that best unite the what with the how. How we say something is at\nleast as important as what we say; in fact, the content and the form are quite\ninseparable, being but two facets of the same object. One way of looking at this\nrelationship is to examine a few specific aspects of communication: namely, pro-\nnominal choice between tu and vous forms in languages that require a choice;the\nuse of naming and address terms; and the employment of politeness markers. In\neach case we will see that certain linguistic choices a speaker makes indicate the\nsocial relationship that the speaker perceives to exist between him or her and\nthe listener or listeners. Moreover, in many cases it is impossible to avoid making\nsuch choices in the actual \u2018packaging\u2019 of messages. We will also see that lan-\nguages vary considerably in this respect, at least in regard to those aspects we\nwill examine.\nTu and Vous\nMany languages have a distinction corresponding to the tu\u2013vous (T\/V) distinc-\ntion in French, where grammatically there is a \u2018singular you\u2019 tu (T) and a \u2018plural\nyou\u2019 vous (V) but usage requires that you use vous with individuals on certain\noccasions. The T form is sometimes described as the \u2018familiar\u2019 form and the V\nform as the \u2018polite\u2019 one. Other languages with a similar T\/V distinction are\nLatin (tu\/vos), Russian (ty\/vy), Italian (tu\/Lei), German (du\/Sie), Swedish (du\/ni),\nand Greek (esi\/esis). English, itself, once had such a distinction, the thou\/you\ndistinction.\nAccording to Brown and Gilman (1960), the T\/V distinction began as a\ngenuine difference between singular and plural. However, a complication arose,\nwhich they explain as follows (p. 25):\nIn the Latin of antiquity there was only tu in the singular. The plural vos as a form\nof address to one person was first directed to the emperor, and there are several\ntheories...about how this may have come about. The use of the plural to the\nAITC11 260 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 261\nemperor began in the fourth century. By that time there were actually two em-\nperors; the ruler of the eastern empire had his seat in Constantinople and the\nruler of the west sat in Rome. Because of Diocletian\u2019s reforms the imperial office,\nalthough vested in two men, was administratively unified. Words addressed to one\nman were, by implication, addressed to both. The choice of vos as a form of\naddress may have been in response to this implicit plurality. An emperor is also\nplural in another sense; he is the summation of his people and can speak as their\nrepresentative. Royal persons sometimes say \u2018we\u2019 where an ordinary man would\nsay \u2018I.\u2019 The Roman emperor sometimes spoke of himself as nos, and the reverential\nvos is the simple reciprocal of this.\nThe consequence of this usage was that by medieval times the upper classes\napparently began to use V forms with each other to show mutual respect and\npoliteness. However, T forms persisted, so that the upper classes used mutual V,\nthe lower classes used mutual T, and the upper classes addressed the lower\nclasses with T but received V. This latter asymmetrical T\/V usage therefore came\nto symbolize a power relationship. It was extended to such situations as people\nto animals, master or mistress to servants, parents to children, priest to penitent,\nofficer to soldier, and even God to angels, with, in each case, the first mentioned\ngiving T but receiving V.\nSymmetrical V usage became \u2018polite\u2019 usage. This polite usage spread down-\nward in society, but not all the way down, so that in certain classes, but never\nthe lowest, it became expected between husband and wife, parents and children,\nand lovers. Symmetrical T usage was always available to show intimacy, and its\nuse for that purpose also spread to situations in which two people agreed they\nhad strong common interests, i.e., a feeling of solidarity. This mutual T for\nsolidarity gradually came to replace the mutual V of politeness, since solidarity\nis often more important than politeness in personal relationships. Moreover,\nthe use of the asymmetrical T\/V to express power decreased and mutual V was\noften used in its place, as between officer and soldier. Today we can still find\nasymmetrical T\/V uses, but solidarity has tended to replace power, so that now\nmutual T is found quite often in relationships which previously hadasymmetrical\nusage, e.g., father and son, and employer and employee. Brown and Gilman\u2019s\nstudy of how upper-class French, German, and Italian youth described their use\nof T\/V forms clearly indicates the importance of solidarity over power. They\nobserve as follows (pp. 263\u20134):\nThe many particular differences among the three languages are susceptible of a\ngeneral characterization. Let us first contrast German and French. The German T\nis more reliably applied within the family than is the French T; in addition to the\nsignificantly higher T scores for grandfather and elder brother\u2019s wife, there are\nsmaller differences showing a higher score for the German T on father, mother,\nwife, married elder brother, and remote male cousin. The French T is not automat-\nically applied to remote relatives, but it is more likely than the German pronoun\nto be used to express the camaraderie of fellow students, fellow clerks, fellow\ncountrymen abroad, and fellow soldiers. In general it may be said that the solidar-\nity coded by the German T is an ascribed solidarity of family relationships. The\nFrench T, in greater degree, codes an acquired solidarity, not founded on family\nrelationships but developing out of some sort of shared fate. As for the Italian T,\nAITC11 261 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 262 Solidarity and Politeness\nit very nearly equals the German in family solidarity and it surpasses the French\nin camaraderie. The camaraderie of the Italian male, incidentally, is extended to\nthe Italian female; unlike the French or German student, the Italian says T to the\nco-ed almost as readily as to the male fellow student.\nBecause solidarity is so important, it sometimes falls on one party to initiate\nthe use of T. Brown and Gilman explain how such a change may be initiated,\ni.e., the change from asymmetrical T\/V or polite V\/V to mutual T (p. 260):\nThere is an interesting residual of the power relation in the contemporary notion\nthat the right to initiate the reciprocal T belongs to the member of the dyad having\nthe better power-based claim to say T without reciprocation. The suggestion that\nsolidarity be recognized comes more gracefully from the elder than from the younger,\nfrom the richer than from the poorer, from the employer than from the employee,\nfrom the noble than from the commoner, from the female than from the male.\nIt has been observed that Germans who have come to know each other quite\nwell often make almost a little ceremony (Br\u00fcderschaft trinken) of the occasion\nwhen they decide to say du to each other rather than Sie. One French speaker\nwill also sometimes propose to another that they tutoyer each other. Usually, on\nsuch occasions it is the superior in the relationship who initiates the change.\nOnce a pair of speakers decide on mutual T, it is also impossible to go back to\neither T\/V or V\/V usage without changing the social relationship.\nBrown and Gilman\u2019s study of T\/V usage led them to make the following\nobservation (p. 272):\nThere is enough consistency of address to justify speaking of a personal-pronoun\nstyle which involves a more or less wide use of the solidary T. Even among students\nof the same socioeconomic level there are differences of style, and these are potent-\nially expressive of radicalism and conservatism in ideology. A Frenchman could,\nwith some confidence, infer that a male university student who regularly said T to\nfemale fellow students would favor the nationalization of industry, free love, trial\nmarriage, the abolition of capital punishment, and the weakening of nationalistic\nand religious loyalties.\nThis is an interesting claim, that you could at the time of writing listen to a\nyoung French male of a certain class and from his T\/V usage predict certain\nopinions he would be likely to hold. As we will see, another study confirmed\nmuch the same predictive value for T\/V usage among a corresponding social\ngroup in Italy.\nLambert and Tucker (1976) pointed out that all French communities and all\ngroups within a community are not alike in their T\/V usage. For example, chil-\ndren in Montreal and certain rural parts of Quebec, in the small city of Laval,\nin Mayenne, France, and in the sparsely populated French islands of Saint-Pierre\net Miquelon lying just off the south coast of Newfoundland, Canada, exhibit\ndifferent T\/V usage. In the last two places children use tu with all kin and\ngodparents, but in Quebec, especially in rural areas, they still use a considerable\namount of vous within the family, particularly as distance in age andrelationship\nAITC11 262 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 263\nincreases. Children themselves receive tu in all three places: in Quebec this use\nis almost universal for adults to children and young men, regardless of circum-\nstance. In both Saint-Pierre and Laval, however, either some acquaintanceship or\nsome familiarity is necessary before tu is used reciprocally in most circumstances\nbeyond the family. Quebec appears to be the most conservative in T\/V usage,\nwith vous expected by strangers and older people. When a young person uses\ntu to someone who might expect vous, that violation is noted even though it\nmay not lead to comment.\nAger (1990, p. 209) points out that in an advertising agency in Pariseverybody\nuses tu except to the owner and the cleaning woman. He adds that in general\ntu is used with intimate acquaintances and people considered to be extremely\nsubordinate, commenting that, \u2018There is nothing intimate or friendly in the tu\nused by the policeman who is checking the papers of a young person or an\nimmigrant worker.\u2019 However, upper-class social leaders still use vous widely\nwith intimates: President Giscard d\u2019Estaing in the 1970s used vous in talking to\neverybody in his household \u2013 wife, children, and dogs included \u2013 and at the time\nof writing the well-connected wife of President Chirac addresses her husband\nwith vous but he uses tu to almost everyone.\nA book published in France entitled Savoir-vivre en France (Vigner, 1978)\ngives the following advice to foreigners on the current use of tu and vous there.\nTu should be used between spouses, between brothers and sisters regardless\nof age, between parents and children, between close relatives, between young\npeople living or working closely together or older people engaged in some com-\nmon endeavor, and between adults who have a friendship of long standing,\nparticularly adults of the same gender. Vous should be used between strangers,\nbetween those who have no ties of any kind, and between inferior and superior.\nAccording to Vigner, tu is customary in certain types of work relationships and\namong the young, but there are no precise rules for its use. You should not,\nhowever, use tu indiscriminately, since such behavior will seem excessively famil-\niar and will not be appreciated. Since there is no precise rule for shifting from\nvous to tu, it is best to wait until the other person uses it to address you before\nyou use it to address him or her. This last bit of advice has a certain logic to\nit: if you cannot judge who has power, settle for politeness and wait until the\nother indicates solidarity. However, the inescapable linguistic fact is that tu\ncontinues to replace vous everywhere; the historical progression is clearlytoward\n\u00e9galit\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9 and away from pouvoir.\nTamil also has a T\/V distinction. One study showed that in one caste-based\nTamil-speaking village, the lower the caste, the greater the T usage. In the upper\ncastes there was considerable symmetrical V usage but also instances of asym-\nmetrical T\/V usage. It seems that in such circumstances symmetrical T usage\nis quite non-prestigious and the greater the V usage, the more prestige. In an\nattempt to explain this phenomenon, Brown and Levinson (1979, pp. 332\u20133)\npostulate that \u2018T\/V usage is tied primarily to kinds of social relationship, and\nthe association of T-exchange with low-status groups in stratified societies is due\nto the way that stratification affects the nature of intra-group social relations.\u2019\nThey believe that people in the lower strata in such societies are necessarily quite\ninterdependent, so that \u2018relations of equality and solidarity are likely to arise\nAITC11 263 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 264 Solidarity and Politeness\nbetween adults, appropriately symbolized by mutual T-exchange.\u2019 Social net-\nworks among the upper strata are much more fragmented, people are more\nindependent, and social distance is more normal. Hence the V-exchange found\nin such groups. Family relationships are also more hierarchical and that also\nprecludes the use of T-exchange.\nBolivia is a Spanish-speaking country with two-thirds of its inhabitants of\nindigenous descent, mainly Aymara and Quechua. While Spanish is the language\nof La Paz, many inhabitants prefer to dress in ways that show their indigenous\naffiliation. Placencia (2001) looked at what happened when such people partici-\npated in a variety of service encounters in public institutions, such as hospitals,\na government agency, and a city hall, with the service providers being either\nwhites or indigenous people (white mestizos) who had adopted a Spanishidentity\nin order \u2018to move up the social ladder\u2019 (p. 199). She was particularly interested\nin the use of the familiar t\u00fa and vos, and the formal usted and ustedes. Across\na variety of different encounters, such as making requests for information and\nreceiving instructions or requests for payment or to move up in a waiting line,\nshe found that in contrast to white mestizos seeking similar services, \u2018indigenous\npersons were generally addressed with the familiar form t\u00fa or vos, were not the\nrecipients of titles or politeness formulas, and, in certain interactions were asked\nfor information or were directed to perform actions with more directness than\nwere their white-mestizo counterparts\u2019 (pp. 211\u201312). Placencia says that social\ndiscrimination was quite obviously at work. She adds that \u2018the use of thefamiliar\nform in address to indigenous persons seems to be so ingrained in the linguistic\nbehavior of white-mestizos that they are not even aware of it\u2019 (p. 123). While\nthey thought they were being polite, actual observations showed they were not.\nInequality was ingrained beyond the reach of social consciousness.\nLet us return to a more \u2018democratic\u2019 Europe and look at some class differ-\nences there in T\/V usage. There is some evidence (Bates and Benigni, 1975) to\nsuggest that T\/V usage in Italy is continuing to evolve. A survey of such usage\namong 117 Italian residents of Rome aged between 15 and 35, and 45 and 65\nrevealed that symmetrical address was the norm in most circumstances, with\ndifference in age the only factor likely to bring about asymmetrical usage.\nHowever, upper-class youth and lower-class youth tended to behave differently.\nOn the whole, lower-class youth were more formal in their choices than upper-\nclass youth, who behaved much as they did in the Brown and Gilman study.\nOne reason for the different behaviors may be that lower-class youth aspire to\nwhat they consider to be the practices current among higher social groups, and\nupper-class youth, who quite often show radical tendencies, attempt to imitate\nwhat they consider to be the style of the \u2018people.\u2019 Informal observation tended\nto confirm this interpretation. An upper-class youth faced with the problem of\naddressing a lower-class youth can use tu for solidarity, but tu is also a tradi-\ntional asymmetrical form. The polite Lei is safe. The result sometimes is that\nwith certain upper-class youth there is an almost complete reversal in the use of\ntu and Lei, with Lei used for attempts to achieve solidarity with members of the\nlower classes, e.g., waiters and servants, and tu used to address professors and\nemployers. But the distinction may be no less rigid in practice than the use of\ntu and Lei before the reversal occurred.\nAITC11 264 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 265\nBates and Benigni also comment (pp. 280\u20131) on the following claim that\nBrown and Gilman (1960, p. 175) make concerning the previously quoted political\nviews of a young upper-class French male: \u2018A Frenchman could, with some\nconfidence, infer that a male university student who regularly said T to female\nfellow students would favor the nationalization of industry, free love, trial\nmarriage, the abolition of capital punishment, and the weakening of national-\nistic and religious loyalties.\u2019 They agree that the claim is valid for upper-class\nItalian youth, but for that class alone: \u2018One could not, with any confidence,\npredict the political philosophy of a young blue-collar worker upon hearing him\naddress a young female as tu\u2019 (Bates and Benigni, 1975, p. 281). While upper-\nclass youth appear to be reversing the traditional pattern of T\/V usage without\nnecessarily changing the system, change is apparent in other groups in society,\nparticularly a change toward symmetrical usage. Today, most Italians are likely\nto expect to receive the same address form that they give. For a similar updateon\nGerman usage, see Clyne (1984, pp. 124\u20138), who notes a recent move backtoward\nmore conservative, i.e., earlier, usage. Braun (1988, p. 30) tells, for example, of\nan incident in Germany in 1977. A German greengrocer, a woman, used du to\na policeman, who found such use offensive and took her to court for it. The\njudge agreed with him and fined the greengrocer 2,250 German marks even\nthough she claimed that in her rural dialect such use of du was not offensive.\nThere is considerable evidence that power is no longer as important as it once\nwas in determining T\/V usage; there has been a dramatic shift in recent yearsto\nsolidarity. However, many local variations still remain. For example, solidarity\nin the French Revolution called for symmetrical T usage but in the Russian\nRevolution, symmetrical V usage. Symmetrical T usage has always been charac-\nteristic of lower-class relationships, so it may be avoided in certain circum-\nstances to deny any semblance of lower-class membership in a quest for politeness.\nOn the other hand, T forms have sometimes exerted a very special appeal to\nthose of upper-class origin as they have attempted to give their speech a delib-\nerately democratic flavor. We can expect different societies to devise different\nways of handling the T\/V distinction, and this is indeed what we find, with\nT\/V forms being differently employed currently in Germany, France, and Italy.\nMoreover, that T\/V usage is constantly evolving. It may not even be the case\nthat the evolution is always toward solidarity and away from power. Power is\nstill very much part of modern social structure, and it would be surprising if all\ntraces of its effect were quite suddenly to vanish from T\/V pronominal usage.\nFor example, Keevallik (1999) provides an interesting account of how school\nchildren in Estonia learn to use the T\/V system of that language: sa (or sina) vs.\nte (or teie). There is considerable variety of usage within the system as factors\nsuch as age, town vs. country, formality, and changing power relationships are\ninvolved. There are also avoidance strategies but these are not always available.\nThe result is that \u2018singular and plural address in Estonian is actively and creat-\nively used for establishing and maintaining the character of social relations as\nwell as for accomplishing various activities, such as degrading, condemning, or\nnagging\u2019 (p. 143).\nEnglish, of course, has no active T\/V distinction. The use of T forms by such\ngroups as Quakers is very much limited, but these T forms are a solidarity\nAITC11 265 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 266 Solidarity and Politeness\nmarker for those who do use them. The T\/V use that remains in English is\narchaic, found in fixed formulas such as prayers or in use in plays written during\nthe era when the T\/V distinction was alive or in modern works that try to\nrecapture aspects of that era. It is still possible, however, for speakers of English\nto show power and solidarity relationships through language; they just have to\nuse other means. As we will see, speakers of English, just like speakers of other\nlanguages, can use address terms for that purpose.\nDiscussion\n1. Languages such as Ainu, Tagalog, Tamil, and Turkish also have a T\/V\ndistinction. How does that strengthen or weaken Brown and Gilman\u2019s claims\nabout the origin of the distinction?\n2. Explain the distinction between you and you all as these are used in parts\nof the southern United States. Is this a T\/V distinction of the kind discussed\nin this chapter?\n3. In a novel based on his experiences and entitled Men in Prison, Victor Serge\n(1977) describes the use of tu in a French prison at the beginning of the\ntwentieth century as follows (p. 21):\nOnce inside prison walls, the use of the familiar tu is practically a rule among\ninmates. At the house of detention, where crowds of transients are always\ncoming and going \u2013 in that sudden physical indignity of arrest which is so\nmuch harder on new prisoners than on underworld \u2018regulars\u2019 \u2013 the guards call\nalmost everyone tu. Elsewhere, after a rapid process of classification by social\ncategories, they reserve this vulgarly familiar address for inmates who com-\nmand no respect or consideration. One of my first observations \u2013 the accuracy\nof which was confirmed many times later on \u2013 was that this use of the familiar\nform by guards to inmates, or by policemen to criminals, is an instinctive\nrecognition of a common existence and a common mentality. Guards and\ninmates live the same life on both sides of the same bolted door. Policemen\nand crooks keep the same company, sit on the same barstools, sleep with the\nsame whores in the same furnished rooms. They mold each other like two\narmies fighting with complementary methods of attack and defense on a\ncommon terrain.\nComment on Serge\u2019s explanation of the guards\u2019 use of tu. In a review of\nAndrei Amalrik\u2019s Notes of a Revolutionary in The New Yorker (March 26,\n1984, p. 130), William Maxwell reports the following bit of behavior by\nAmalrik in a Soviet prison:\nTo the prison officials who addressed him by the familiar \u2013 and, in the circum-\nstances, insulting \u2013 second-person singular, he replied by calling them \u2018ty\u2019 also;\nwhereupon they instantly switched to the polite form.\nExplain what the officials and the prisoner were attempting to do through\ntheir choices of T\/V forms on such occasions.\nAITC11 266 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 267\n4. In Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth Night, Sir Toby Belch urges Andrew Aguecheek to\nsend a challenge to the disguised Viola as follows: \u2018Taunt him with the\nlicense of ink, if thou thou\u2019st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss.\u2019 At Sir\nWalter Raleigh\u2019s trial for treason in 1603 Sir Edward Coke attacked him as\nfollows: \u2018All that he did, was at thy instigation, thou viper; for I thou thee,\nthou traitor.\u2019 Explain why in each case T forms are used instead of V forms.\nAddress Terms\nHow do you name or address another? By title (T), by first name (FN), by last\nname (LN), by a nickname, by some combination of these, or by nothing at all,\nso deliberately avoiding the problem? What factors govern the choice you make?\nIs the address process asymmetrical; that is, if I call you Mr Jones, do you call\nme John? Or is it symmetrical, so that Mr Jones leads to Mr Smith and John\nto Fred? All kinds of combinations are possible in English: Dr Smith, John\nSmith, Smith, John, Johnnie, Doc, Sir, Mack, and so on. Dr Smith himself might\nalso expect Doctor from a patient, Dad from his son, John from his brother,\nDear from his wife, and Sir from a police officer who stops him if he drives too\nfast, and he might be rather surprised if any one of these is substituted for any\nother, e.g., \u2018Excuse me, dear, can I see your licence?\u2019 from the police officer.\nIn looking at some of the issues involved in naming and addressing, let us first\nexamine practices among an \u2018exotic\u2019 people to distance ourselves somewhatfrom\nEnglish. A brief look at such a different system may possibly allow us to gain\na more objective perspective on what we do with our own language and in our\nown culture. That objectivity is not just useful; it is quite necessary if we are to\navoid conclusions distorted by ethnocentricity.\nThe Nuer, a Sudanese people, have very different naming practices from those\nwith which we are likely to be familiar (Evans-Pritchard, 1948). Every Nuer has\na personal or birth name, which is a name given to the child by the parents\nshortly after birth and retained for life. A personal name may be handed down,\nparticularly to sons, for a son may be called something equivalent to \u2018son of\n[personal name].\u2019 Nuer personal names are interesting in what they name, e.g.,\nReath \u2018drought,\u2019 Nhial \u2018rain,\u2019 Pun \u2018wild rice,\u2019 Cuol \u2018to compensate,\u2019 Mun \u2018earth,\u2019\nand Met \u2018to deceive.\u2019 Sometimes the maternal grandparents give a child a second\npersonal name. The consequence is that a child\u2019s paternal kin may address the\nchild by one personal name and the child\u2019s maternal kin by another. There are\nalso special personal names for twins and children who are born after twins.\nMales are addressed by their personal names in their paternal villages during\nboyhood, but this usage shifts in later years when senior males are addressed\nas Gwa \u2018father\u2019 by less senior males, who themselves receive Gwa from much\nyounger males. Children, however, call everyone in the village by their personal\nnames, older people and parents included.\nEvery Nuer child also has a clan name, but this name is largely ceremonial\nso that its use is confined to such events as weddings and initiations. Use of the\nAITC11 267 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 268 Solidarity and Politeness\nclan name between females expresses considerable formality as when a woman\nuses it to address her son\u2019s wife. The clan name may also be used by mothers\nto their small children to express approval and pleasure. Clan names are also\nused when one is addressed outside one\u2019s local tribal area by people from other\ntribes.\nIn addition to personal names, which are given, and clan names, which are\ninherited, the Nuer also have ox names, that is, names derived from a favored\nox. A man may choose his own ox name. This is a name which a man uses in\nthe triumphs of sport, hunting, and war, and it is the name used among age-\nmates for purposes of address. Women\u2019s ox names come from the bulls calved\nby the cows they milk. Women\u2019s ox names are used mainly among women.\nOccasionally, young men will address young girls by their ox names as part of\nflirting behavior or their sisters by these names if they are pleased with them.\nMarried women replace the ox names with cow names taken from the family\nherds, and men do not use these names at all.\nEvans-Pritchard points out a number of further complications in naming and\naddressing, having to do with the complicated social arrangements found in\nNuer life. A person\u2019s name varies with circumstances, for each person has a\nnumber of names which he or she can use. In addressing another, the choice of\nname which you use for the other depends both on your knowledge of exactly\nwho that other is (e.g., his or her age and lineage) and on the circumstances of\nthe meeting. (For another fascinating account of naming practices, this time\namong the Giriama, a coastal people of Kenya, see Parkin, 1989.)\nHaving taken this brief glance at Nuer name and addressing practices, we can\nnow turn our attention to English usage. Brown and Ford\u2019s study (1961) ofnam-\ning practices in English was based on an analysis of modern plays, the naming\npractices observed in a business in Boston, and the reported usage of business\nexecutives and children in the mid-western United States and in \u2018Yoredale\u2019 in\nEngland. They report that the asymmetric use of title, last name, and firstname\n(TLN\/FN) indicated inequality in power, that mutual TLN indicated inequality\nand unfamiliarity, and that mutual FN indicated equality and familiarity. The\nswitch from mutual TLN to FN is also usually initiated by the more powerful\nmember of the relationship. Other options exist too in addressing another: title\nalone (T), e.g., Professor or Doctor; last name alone (LN), e.g., Smith; or mul-\ntiple naming, e.g., variation between Mr Smith and Fred. We should note that\nin such a classification, titles like Sir or Madam are generalized variants of the\nT(itle) category, i.e., generic titles, and forms like Mack, Buddy, Jack, or Mate\nare generic first names (FN), as in \u2018What\u2019s up, Mate?\u2019 or \u2018Hey, Mack, I wouldn\u2019t\ndo that if I were you.\u2019\nAddress by title alone is the least intimate form of address in that titles usu-\nally designate ranks or occupations, as in Colonel, Doctor, or Waiter. They are\ndevoid of \u2018personal\u2019 content. We can argue therefore that Doctor Smith is more\nintimate than Doctor alone, acknowledging as it does that the other person\u2019s\nname is known and can be mentioned. Knowing and using another\u2019s first nameis,\nof course, a sign of considerable intimacy or at least of a desire for suchintimacy.\nUsing a nickname or pet name shows an even greater intimacy. When someone\nuses your first name alone in addressing you, you may feel on occasion that that\nAITC11 268 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 269\nperson is presuming an intimacy you do not recognize or, alternatively, is trying\nto assert some power over you. Note that a mother\u2019s John Smith to a misbehav-\ning son reduces the intimacy of first name alone, or first name with diminutive\n(Johnny), or pet name (Honey), and consequently serves to signal a rebuke.\nWe can see some of the possible dangers in cross-cultural communication\nwhen different relationships are expressed through what appears, superficially at\nleast, to be the same address system. The dangers are even greater if you learn\nthe terms in a new address system but fail to appreciate how they are related\nto one another. Ervin-Tripp (1972, p. 231) provides the following example:\nSuppose the speaker, but not the listener, has a system in which familiarity, not\nmerely solidarity, is required for use of a first name. He will use TLN in the United\nStates to his new colleagues and be regarded as aloof or excessively formal. He will\nfeel that first-name usage from his colleagues is brash and intrusive. In the same\nway, encounters across social groups may lead to misunderstandings within the\nUnited States. Suppose a used-car salesman regards his relation to his customers as\nsolidary, or a physician so regards his relation to old patients. The American...might\nregard such speakers as intrusive, having made a false claim to a solidary status.\nIn this way, one can pinpoint abrasive features of interaction across groups.\nI might add that the use of a person\u2019s first name in North America does not\nnecessarily indicate friendship or respect. First names are required among people\nwho work closely together, even though they may not like each other at all. First\nnames may even be used to refer to public figures, but contemptuously as well\nas admiringly.\nThe asymmetric use of names and address terms is often a clear indicator of\na power differential. School classrooms are almost universally good examples;\nJohn and Sally are likely to be children and Miss or Mr Smith to be teachers.\nFor a long time in the southern states of the United States, whites used nam-\ning and addressing practices to put blacks in their place. Hence the odious use\nof Boy to address black males. The asymmetrical use of names also was part\nof the system. Whites addressed blacks by their first names in situations which\nrequired them to use titles, or titles and last names, if they were addressing\nwhites. There was a clear racial distinction in the practice. According to Johnson\n(1943, p. 140), one consequence of this practice was that:\nmiddle- and upper-class Negro women never permit their first names to be\nknown....The wife of a well-to-do Negro business man went into a department\nstore in Atlanta to enquire about an account. The clerk asked her first name and\nshe said \u2018Mrs William Jones.\u2019 The clerk insisted on her first name, and when she\nrefused to give it declared that the business could not be completed without it. It\nwas a large account; and the manager, to whom appeal was made, decided that\n\u2018Mrs\u2019 was simply good business and not \u2018social equality.\u2019\nIn this case \u2018good business\u2019 overrode the desire to reinforce the social inequality\nthat would have resulted from the woman\u2019s giving the sales-clerk the informa-\ntion requested and then the inevitable use of that first name alone by the clerk\nin addressing the customer.\nAITC11 269 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 270 Solidarity and Politeness\nBharati Mukherjee\u2019s novel Jasmine (1989) is the story of an Indian woman\nJyoti, who early in life marries a \u2018modern\u2019 man Prakash (p. 77):\nHe wanted me to call him by his first name. \u2018Only in feudal societies is the woman\nstill a vassal,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Hasnapur is feudal.\u2019 In Hasnapur wives used only\npronouns to address their husbands. The first months, eager and obedient as I was,\nI still had a hard time calling him Prakash. I\u2019d cough to get his attention, or start\nwith \u2018Are you listening?\u2019 Every time I coughed he\u2019d say, \u2018Do I hear a crow trying\nhuman speech?\u2019 Prakash. I had to practice and practice (in the bathroom, in the\ntarped-over corner of the verandah which was our kitchen) so I could say the name\nwithout gagging or blushing in front of his friends. He liked to show me off. His\nfriends were like him: disrupters and rebuilders, idealists.\nPrakash is opposed to the feudalistic traditions which surround them and\nasymmetrical naming, being one of them, must go. Jyoti also becomes Jasmine\nand has to struggle with these new ways and the new identity the name gives\nher. Such an asymmetrical system between spouses is not at all unusual. In Java\na wife may address her husband as mas \u2018elder brother\u2019 and get her first name,\na nickname, or dhik \u2018younger sibling\u2019 from him, a reflection of the traditional\ndifference in status between husband and wife.\nDickey (1996, 1997a, 1997b) examined 11,891 address terms in Greek prose\nwriters over more than six centuries (approximately 450 bce to 160 ce) plus\n1,683 other terms from other sources. In this upper-class Athenian society names\n\u2013 and these Greeks had only a single name, a given name \u2013 were commonly\nused in addressing others, e.g., by free adult males to address each other. Slaves\nwere usually addressed as pa\u00ee \u2018child\u2019; they in turn addressed their masters and\nmistresses as d\u00e9spota \u2018master\u2019 or d\u00e9spoina \u2018mistress,\u2019 although they sometimes\nused names too. Men addressed women by either name or g\u00fanai \u2018woman,\u2019 and\nwomen and children addressed men by name. Children addressed parents as\neither pater \u2018father\u2019 or m\u00eater \u2018mother,\u2019 and parents addressed children as hui\u00e9\n\u2018son,\u2019 th\u00fagater \u2018daughter,\u2019 or pa\u00ee \u2018child.\u2019 Siblings used names or \u00e1delphe \u2018brother\u2019\nor adelphe \u2018sister.\u2019 Husbands usually addressed their wives by g\u00fanai and their\nmistresses by name. A wife used either her husband\u2019s name or \u00e1ner \u2018husband.\u2019\nDickey says (1997b, p. 8) that \u2018there was, to all intents and purposes, only one\nway to address a man by name in Athens.\u2019\nIn English, when we are in doubt as to how to address another we can\nactually avoid the difficulty by not using any address term at all. We can say\nGood morning as well as Good morning, Sir\/Mr Smith\/Susie. In other languages\nsuch avoidance may be either impolite or deficient. In France, you cannot say\nBonjour, Au revoir, Merci, or Pardon without attaching an address term. So the\nFrench say Bonjour, Monsieur or Merci, Pierre, whereas we can say simplyGood\nmorning or Thank you.\nIn English we therefore have the possibility of the avoidance of an address\nterm, that is, \u00d8 use, or of a choice between familiar and polite. One simple test\nfor distinguishing familiar, informal address terms from polite, formal ones in\nEnglish is to look at them in conjunction with informal and formal greetings\nand leave-takings, e.g., Hi, Bye, and So long in comparison with Good morning\nAITC11 270 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 271\nand Goodbye. Hi, Sally; Bye, Honey; and So long, Doc are possible, just as are\nGood morning, Mr Smith and Goodbye, Sir. However, there is somethingpeculiar\nabout Hi, Colonel Jones; Bye, Professor; Good morning, Mate; and Goodbye,\nPussykins. (See McConnell-Ginet, 2003, for a discussion of naming and address-\ning in relation to issues of gender.)\nAs you age and your family relationships change, issues of naming and\naddressing may arise. For example, knowing how to address your father-in-\nlaw (or mother-in-law) has often been a problem for many people: Mr Smith is\nsometimes felt to be too formal, Bill too familiar, and Dad pre-empted or even\n\u2018unnatural.\u2019 The arrival of grandchildren is sometimes seen as a way out, it\nbeing easier to call a father-in-law Grandad than Dad. Such a move may also\nbe accompanied in some families with a switch of address for your own parents,\nso that your mother is addressed as Grandma rather than Mom; sometimes this\nappears to be intended only as a temporary help to the grandchildren in learn-\ning the right terms of address, but it can easily become a permanent change\nso that Grandad and Grandma come to replace Dad and Mom. In some cases\nGrandma may be used for the maternal grandmother and Gran or Nana for\nthe paternal one, or vice versa.\nSome languages actually employ what we regard as kinship terms for use as\naddress terms. We saw the equivalent of English father so used among the Nuer.\nLuong (1990) describes how Vietnamese makes extensive use of kinship terms\nas forms of address, e.g., ch\u00e1u \u2018grandchild,\u2019 b\u00e0 \u2018grandmother,\u2019 and b\u00e1c \u2018senior\nuncle\/aunt.\u2019 The kinship system itself is generation- and age-oriented with terms\nfor both the paternal and maternal sides. It also gives more weight to males than\nfemales. Children are also ordered, for example as \u2018sibling two,\u2019 \u2018sibling three,\u2019\netc. \u2013 there is no \u2018sibling one\u2019 \u2013 and a term like anh can be used for both \u2018elder\nbrother\u2019 and \u2018male cousin, same generation.\u2019 Bare English translation of Viet-\nnamese terms into English words like aunt, cousin, etc., always seems deficient\nto Vietnamese; as Luong says, \u2018linguistic forms...play a vital instrumental role\nin the structuring of sociocultural reality\u2019 (p. 166) so that the Englishequivalents\nfall far short of Vietnamese understanding of social relationships. As a further\ninstance, Pham (2002) says that \u2018Between married couples, minh [\u201cbody\u201d] is\nused to address the spouse, by either the husband or wife. If the speaker is the\nhusband, he uses anh \u201celder brother\u201d for self-reference. If the speaker is a wife,\nshe uses em \u201cyounger sibling\u201d for self-reference\u2019 (p. 295). However, times are\nchanging and in \u2018urban settings now, if husbands are younger than their wives,\nwives \u2013 particularly educated ones \u2013 consider the term em for self-reference to\nbe either humorous or embarrassing. In this case, proper names come to the\nrescue: wives refer to their husbands and to themselves by proper names, or they\nuse anh \u201celder brother\u201d to address their husbands and their own proper names\nto refer to themselves\u2019 (p. 308). Vietnamese address non-relatives using various\nsuch kinship terms because neither names (patronyms, middle names, and per-\nsonal names) find extensive use nor do personal pronouns, the latter tending to\nexpress non-solidarity or used typically only by children or certain less favored\nsocial groups. (See Oyetade, 1995, for still another example of the use of kin-\nship terms to address strangers, this time among the Yoruba of Nigeria.) Dickey\n(1997a, p. 272) hypothesizes that such systems of terms originated in thetendency\nAITC11 271 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 272 Solidarity and Politeness\nof adults to take the perspective of small children in referring to older relatives\nin order to teach the children how to address these relatives \u2018correctly.\u2019\nOne additional peculiarity of systems of naming and addressing is that people\nsometimes give names to, and address, non-humans as well as humans. In a\nsociety where people keep a lot of pets of different kinds, there is likely to be\na considerable variety of names and forms of address used depending on the\nkind of pet, e.g., horse, cat, or gerbil, and the circumstances, e.g., whether you\nare alone with the pet or in public view, feeding it, or reprimanding it. It is\nsometimes said that you can learn a lot about other people from the pets they\nkeep; if this is so, part of that \u2018keeping\u2019 is how those pets are treatedlinguistically.\nWe should not be surprised that people who view animals very differently are\nsometimes mystified by our treatment of animals and the way we talk to them,\nquite often in ways that resemble the way we employ with very young children.\nIf we look at what is involved in addressing another, it seems that a variety\nof social factors usually governs our choice of terms: the particular occasion; the\nsocial status or rank of the other; gender; age; family relationship; occupational\nhierarchy; transactional status (i.e., a service encounter, or a doctor\u2013patient rela-\ntionship, or one of priest\u2013penitent); race; or degree of intimacy. The choice is\nsometimes quite clear; when racial or caste origin is important in society, that\nis likely to take preference; when family ties are extremely strong, that is likely\nto be preferred; and so on. In societies which claim to be egalitarian there may\nbe some doubt as to what is the appropriate address term, and consequentlynone\nat all may be used between, say, husband and wife\u2019s mother; son who is learning\na lowly job in a company and father who is the company president; policeofficer\nand young male offender; and older male and much younger feminist. There\nalso seems to be an ordered relationship, something like the steps in courting\nbehavior; you proceed to greater and greater familiarity with no back-tracking!\nWhen one party insists on stopping at a point both have previously gone be-\nyond, this is likely to signal a reduction in familiarity and to indicate and be\nperceived as a kind of violation.\nOne consequence is that choosing the right terms of address to use in a hier-\narchical organization may not always be easy. Not many organizations are as\nrigidly organized as the military, for example, but even here there are occasional\ndifficulties, since soldiers must not only maintain a clear chain of command\nbut sometimes must live together, occasionally in very dangerous circumstances\nrequiring solidarity, for long periods of time. The business world is also hier-\narchically organized, though generally less rigidly than the military. One unpub-\nlished study (Staples, 1971) showed that in a large department store employees\nhad a very good idea of how they should address others and be addressed by\nthem. Relative rank in the organizational structure was the key factor in deter-\nmining how two employees would address each other, with status in the organ-\nization overriding any age difference. However, younger employees tended to be\nless formal than older employees in their choice of address terms, and informal\nsituations produced greater familiarity in address than formal ones. What is\napparent too is that, in such a hierarchical structure, those at the bottom seek\nto minimize their difference in status from those at the top and those at the top\nseek to maximize that difference. In trying to do this, members of each group\nAITC11 272 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 273\nTable 11.1 Uses of T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec in China\nCombination Example\n\u00d8 + Title T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Comrade\u2019\nGiven name + Title W\u00e9ig\u00fao T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Comrade Weiguo\u2019\nModifier + Title LAo T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Old Comrade\u2019\nXiAo T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Young Comrade\u2019\n\u00d8 + Title + Title ZhEr\u00e8n T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Comrade Director\u2019\nFamily name + Title W\u00e1ng T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Comrade Wang\u2019\nFamily name + Given name + Title W\u00e1ng W\u00e9ig\u00fao T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Comrade\nWang Weiguo\u2019\nModifier + Family name + Title LAo W\u00e1ng T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018Old Comrade\nWang\u2019\nSource: based on Scotton and Wanjin (1983, pp. 484\u20135)\nuse address terms as a resource in the resulting power struggle, with those at the\nbottom preferring the most familiar terms they can manage to use and those at\nthe top the most formal ones.\nWe can also note that the terms we use to address others are not necessarilythe\nsame as those we use to refer to them when speaking to others. However,Dickey\n(1997a, p. 268) indicates that when A speaks to B about C there is often \u2018a close\nrelationship between the way that person A addresses person C and the waythat\nA refers to C.\u2019 She adds that this is another example of accommodation, spe-\ncifically of convergence behavior, i.e., the need to gain another\u2019s social approval.\nA society undergoing social change is also likely to show certain indicationsof\nsuch change if the language in use in that society has (or had) a complex system\nof address. One such society is modern China (Scotton and Wanjin, 1983, and\nFang and Heng, 1983). The Communist Party of China has promoted the useof\nt\u00f3ngzh\u00ec \u2018comrade\u2019 to replace titles for owners and employers, e.g., lAobAn \u2018pro-\nprietor,\u2019 and also honorific titles, e.g.,\nxi1n.\nsheng \u2018mister.\u2019 The party wants to\nput everyone on an equal footing through encouraging the use of an address\nform that implies no social or economic differences and unites all politically.\nTitles, however, have not entirely disappeared from use. Professional titles are\nstill used, e.g., lAosh3 \u2018teacher\u2019 and d\u00e0i-fu \u2018doctor,\u2019 and skilled workers prefer to\nbe addressed as sh3-fu \u2018master.\u2019 Table 11.1 shows that t\u00f3ngzh\u00ec can be used in a\nvariety of ways (Scotton and Wanjin, 1983, pp. 484\u20135). However, there are\nclear differences among the choices. T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec is used in situations that are some-\nwhat neutral, i.e., when there are no clear indications of power or solidarity and\nno familiarity between the parties, e.g., to an unknown stranger or to someone\nwhose occupation carries with it no title. T\u00f3ngzh\u00ec can also be used deliberately\nto keep another at arm\u2019s length, as it were. For example, a superior may use\nt\u00f3ngzh\u00ec rather than an inferior\u2019s title before offering a rebuke. It can also be\nused in the opposite direction, from inferior to superior, to remind the superior\nof shared interests, or between equals if such sharing is deemed to be more\nAITC11 273 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 274 Solidarity and Politeness\nimportant on a particular occasion than some other difference which could be\nacknowledged through choice of another term.\nHowever, many Chinese still prefer the use of a title to the use of t\u00f3ngzh\u00ec, e.g.,\nzhu\u02c7r\u00e8n \u2018director\u2019 or zhAng \u2018chief.\u2019 There is also widespread use of lAo \u2018old\u2019 and\nxCao \u2018little\u2019 in conjunction with last names as polite forms not only between\nintimates but also to mark social distinctions between non-intimates. An inferior\nmay therefore address a superior by either LAo + LN or LN + title, with practice\nvarying according to location (Fang and Heng, 1983, p. 499), the first variant\nbeing preferred in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the second in less egali-\ntarian medium and small towns. Still another form of address used to elderly\nofficials and scholars and showing great deference is LN + LAo, e.g., W\u00e1ng LAo.\nSome old titles are still used but mainly to accommodate non-Chinese, e.g.,\nt\u00e0itai \u2018Mrs.\u2019 The Chinese address form for a spouse is usually \u00e0iren \u2018lover.\u2019 The\nold xi1nsheng \u2018Mr\u2019 is now applied only to certain older scholars; young teachers\nare called lAosh3 or, if they are professors, ji\u00e0osh\u00f2u. Fang and Heng conclude as\nfollows (p. 506): \u2018The address norms in China are indeed extremelycomplicated.\n...What we have discussed...[are]...some of the changes in address norms\nbrought about by the Revolution. Taken as a whole, changes in address modes\nin today\u2019s China are unique and drastic. Few countries in the world, we believe,\nhave been undergoing such drastic changes in this respect.\u2019 In a later report on\nthe same phenomenon, Ju (1991) points out that sh3-fu has become somewhat\ndevalued through overextension to those not originally deserving it and that\nxi1nsheng has lost its previous derogatory connotations, especially among young\npeople. He concludes (p. 390), \u2018China is changing as are its political and cultural\nsystems. Predictably, there will be further changes in its use of its address terms.\u2019\nKeshavarz (1988) reports on a somewhat similar situation in Iran. The revolu-\ntion there that led to the flight of the Shah resulted in the choice of address\nterms indicating solidarity; however, the old honorifics were also retained.\nConsequently, the need to express solidarity led to greater use of terms like\n\/b\u00e6rad\u00e6r\/ \u2018brother\u2019 and \/xah\u00e6r\/ \u2018sister\u2019 and honorifics have beenreinterpreted\nas indicators of humility and politeness rather than of flattery.\nOne interesting hypothesis about address terms (Robinson, 1972, p. 129) is\nthat, in those societies in which a person\u2019s status derives from his or her achieve-\nments, few distinctions in address are made. In such societies people may use\nonly one basic form of address; they rely on other means for signaling the\nvariety of relationships that we must presume still exist. However, in societies\nwhere status is ascribed, i.e., derived from birth into a particular social group,\nwe are much more likely to find sets of finely graded address terms. Such sets\nreflect the social structures of those societies. Data from the English of North\nAmerica and from a highly stratified society like Java seem to illustrate the two\nextremes; data on address forms from Japan and Korea would also suggest that\nthese societies are much more stratified and that social position within them is\nmore ascribed than earned in contrast to the situations in either North America\nor the United Kingdom. Undoubtedly, some social theorists would strongly dis-\nagree, pointing out that in the last two cases it is still birth rather than ability\nwhich makes the greater contribution to your life chances. Consequently, no\nmatter how intriguing the thesis is, it remains unproved.\nAITC11 274 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 275\nDiscussion\n1.

Murphy (1988) reports that in a North American university setting a\nnumber of factors influenced the choice among various combinations of\ntitles and names when a speaker referred to a third person.

In addition, the relationship between the speaker\nand the addressee also affected the choice.

Do\nyou find any evidence that men and women are treated differently?\n13. Ervin-Tripp (1972, p. 242) says that \u2018one cannot say to a stranger on\nthe street, \u201cMy name is George Landers. What time is it?\u201d or \u201cHello, sir.\nWhere is the post office?\u201d.\u2019 Explain why these are not possible and mark\noff the speaker as in some way unfamiliar with correct English usage.\nPoliteness\nThrough our choice of pronominal forms when a T\/V distinction exists and of\naddress terms, we can show our feelings toward others \u2013 solidarity, power, dis-\ntance, respect, intimacy, and so on \u2013 and our awareness of social customs. Such\nawareness is also shown through the general politeness with which we use lan-\nguage. Politeness itself is socially prescribed. This does not mean, of course, that\nwe must always be polite, for we may be quite impolite to others on occasion.\nHowever, we could not be so if there were no rules of politeness to be broken.\nImpoliteness depends on the existence of standards, or norms, of politeness.\nThe concept of \u2018politeness\u2019 owes a great deal to Goffman\u2019s original work\n(1955, 1967) on \u2018face.\u2019 In social interaction we present a face to others and to\nothers\u2019 faces. We are obliged to protect both our own face and the faces of\nothers to the extent that each time we interact with others we play out a kind\nof mini-drama, a kind of ritual in which each party is required to recognize the\nidentity that the other claims for himself or herself. The consequence is, as\nScollon and Scollon (2001) tell us: \u2018One of the most important ways in which\nwe reduce the ambiguity of communication is by making assumptions about the\npeople we are talking to\u2019 (p. 44). They add: \u2018Any communication is a risk to\nface; it is a risk to one\u2019s own face, at the same time it is a risk to the otherperson\u2019s.\nWe have to carefully project a face for ourselves and to respect the face rightsand\nclaims of other participants....\u201cThere is no faceless communication\u201d\u2019 (p.48).\nIn discussing \u2018politeness,\u2019 the concept of interest to them, Brown and Levinson\n(1987, p. 61) define face as \u2018the public self-image that every member wants to\nclaim for himself.\u2019 They also distinguish between positive face and negative face.\nAITC11 276 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 277\nPositive face is the desire to gain the approval of others, \u2018the positive consistent\nself-image or \u201cpersonality\u201d...claimed by interactants\u2019 (p. 61). Negative face is\nthe desire to be unimpeded by others in one\u2019s actions, \u2018the basic claim to ter-\nritories, personal preserves, rights to non-distraction...freedom of action and\nfreedom from imposition\u2019 (p. 61). Positive face looks for solidarity; negative\nface, however, is more problematic for it requires interactants to recognize each\nother\u2019s negative face, i.e., the need to act without giving offense.\nWhen we interact with others we must be aware of both kinds of face and\ntherefore have a choice of two kinds of politeness. Positive politeness leads to\nmoves to achieve solidarity through offers of friendship, the use of compliments,\nand informal language use: we treat others as friends and allies, do not impose\non them, and never threaten their face. On the other hand, negative politeness\nleads to deference, apologizing, indirectness, and formality in language use: we\nadopt a variety of strategies so as to avoid any threats to the face others are\npresenting to us. Symmetric pronominal use is a good example of positive\npoliteness and asymmetric T\/V use of negative politeness. This approach to\npoliteness has been quite revealing when applied to many Western societies.\nHowever, it has been criticized (Mills, 2003) for encapsulating stereotypical,\nwhite, middle-class (and largely female) language behavior. It may also not work\nso well in other cultures. We will look at two examples: Java and Japan.\nSome languages seem to have built into them very complex systems of polite-\nness. Javanese, one of the principal languages of Indonesia, is a language inwhich,\nas Geertz (1960, p. 248) says \u2018it is nearly impossible to say anything without\nindicating the social relationships between the speaker and the listener in terms\nof status and familiarity.\u2019 Before one Javanese speaks to another, he or she must\ndecide on an appropriate speech style (or styleme, in Geertz\u2019s terminology):\nhigh, middle, or low. Such a decision is necessary because for many words there\nare three distinct variants according to style. For example, the equivalent to the\nEnglish word now is samenika in high style, saniki in middle style, and saiki in\nlow style. You cannot freely shift styles, so the choice of saiki will require the\nspeaker to use arep for the verb equivalent to go rather than adjeng or bade,\n\u02d9\nwhich would be required by the choices of saniki and samenika, respectively.\nBut there is still another level of complication. Javanese has a set of honor-\nifics, referring to such matters as people, body parts, possessions, and human\nactions. These honorifics can be used to further modulate two of the style levels,\nthe high and the low. There are both high honorifics, e.g., dahar for eat, andlow\n\u02d9\nhonorifics, e.g., neda for eat. Only high honorifics can accompany high style,\n\u02d9\nbut both high and low honorifics can accompany low style. We can also use the\nequivalent of English eat to show a further complication. Neda is found in the\n\u02d9\nhigh style with no honorifics, the middle style (which cannot have honorifics),\nand the low style with low honorifics. Dahar for eat always signals high honorifics\n\u02d9\nin either high or low style. In low style without honorifics eat is mangan. We\ncan see the various combinations that are possible if we combine the various\nequivalents of eat and now, as in table 11.2. In addition, table 11.3 shows the\nequivalent of the English sentence, \u2018Are you going to eat rice and cassava now?\u2019\nin the six levels that are possible in Javanese. Geertz adds a further interesting\nobservation: as you move from low to high style, you speak more slowly and\nAITC11 277 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 278 Solidarity and Politeness\nTable 11.2 Levels in Javanese\nSpeech level Example\neat now\n3a high style, high honorifics Dahar samenika\n3 high style, no honorifics neDa samenika\n2 middle style, no honorifics neDa saniki\n1b low style, high honorifics Dahar saiki\n1a low style, low honorifics neDa saiki\n1 low style, no honorifics mangan saiki\nLevel names: 3a krama inggil (high style, high honorifics)\n3 krama biasa (high style, no honorifics)\n2 krama madya (middle style, no honorifics)\n1b ngoko sae (low style, high honorifics)\n1a ngoko madya (low style, low honorifics)\n1 ngoko biasa (low style, no honorifics)\nSource: Geertz (1960)\nTable 11.3 Level differences in a Javanese sentence\nAre you going to eat rice and cassava now?\n3a menapa pandjenengan baD\u00e9 Dahar sekul kalijan kasp\u00e9 samenika\n3 menapa samp\u00e9jan baD\u00e9 neDa sekul lan kasp\u00e9 samenika\n2 napa samp\u00e9jan adjeng neDa sekul lan kasp\u00e9 saniki\n1b apa pandjenengan arep Dahar sega lan kasp\u00e9 saiki\n1a apa samp\u00e9jan arep neDa sega lan kasp\u00e9 saiki\n1 apa kow\u00e9 arep mangan sega lan kasp\u00e9 saiki\nSource: Geertz (1960, p. 250)\nsoftly and more evenly in terms of rhythm and pitch, so that the highest levels,\n\u2018when spoken correctly, have a kind of stately pomp which can make thesimplest\nconversation seem like a great ceremony\u2019 (p. 173).\nIt is not at all easy to specify when a particular level is used. As Geertz says\n(pp. 257\u20138):\nA thorough semantic study of the contexts within which the different levels are\nemployed would in itself be a complex and extended investigation, for the number\nof variables specifically determining the selection of a particular level are very\nAITC11 278 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 279\nnumerous. They include not only qualitative characteristics of the speakers \u2013 age,\nsex, kinship relation, occupation, wealth, education, religious commitment, family\nbackground \u2013 but also more general factors: for instance, the social setting (one\nwould be likely to use a higher level to the same individual at a wedding than in\nthe street); the content of the conversation (in general, one uses lower levels when\nspeaking of commercial matters, higher ones if speaking of religious or aesthetic\nmatters); the history of social interaction between the speakers (one will tend to\nspeak rather high, if one speaks at all, with someone with whom one has quarreled);\nthe presence of a third person (one tends to speak higher to the same individual\nif others are listening). All these play a role, to say nothing of individual idiosyn-\ncratic attitudes. Some people, particularly, it seems, wealthier traders and self-\nconfident village chiefs, who tend to think the whole business rather uncomfortable\nand somewhat silly, speak ngoko to almost everyone except the very high in status.\nOthers will shift levels on any pretext. A complete listing of the determinants of\nlevel selection would, therefore, involve a thorough analysis of the whole frame-\nwork of Javanese culture.\nIrvine (1998, p. 56) points out that \u2018the higher...levels are considered to\nbe governed by an ethic of proper order, peace, and calm. In them one \u201cdoes\nnot express one\u2019s own feelings\u201d....The \u201clower\u201d levels...are the language\none loses one\u2019s temper in.\u2019 The levels are addressee-focused: \u2018polite conduct\ntoward a respected addressee is conduct that is stylized, depersonalized, and\nflat-affect...use of \u201chigh\u201d deferential styles also implies the speaker\u2019s own\nrefinement, as shown by the speaker\u2019s ability to efface emotion, sensitivity to\nthe equanimity of others, and pragmatic delicacy.\u2019 Overall, those of the highest\nsocial rank control the widest range of styles and all the subtleties of the\nhighest of those, while those of low rank employ only a small range at the\nlow end.\nIt is possible to state a few principles that seem to operate. Highest style is\nused among the old aristocrats or by anyone at the highest levels of society who\nwants to give the appearance of elegance. Middle style is used by town-dwellers\nwho are not close friends, or by peasants addressing superiors. Village-dwellers\nwould also use this level with very high superiors since they cannot be expected\nto have any knowledge of high style. Low level is the style all children learn first\nregardless of social-class origin, and everyone uses it on some occasion, even\nclose acquaintances of the highest classes. It is also used to clear inferiors, e.g.,\nby high government officials to peasants and perhaps even to townspeople. Low\nhonorifics added to low style indicate a lack of intimacy and mark a certain\nsocial distance but not much. It is mainly the aristocracy who use the low level\nwith high honorifics but townspeople might use it too; such use seems to indi-\ncate a need to express both intimacy through the use of the low style and respect\nthrough the use of the honorifics, a kind of compromise solution. Men and\nwomen are also required to speak differently. Women are expected to be more\ntalkative than men and to err on the side of being over-polite in their word\nchoices. Javanese men, on the other hand, are required to be extremely careful\nin manipulating the styles of speech because nuanced speech is highly prized.\nMoreover, it is just such a difference that maintains men\u2019s dominance in public\nlife and reserves the domestic realm for women.\nAITC11 279 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 280 Solidarity and Politeness\nGeertz\u2019s caveat still applies: there are many personal and local variations so\nthat the total system is extremely complex and the possibilities for makingwrong\nchoices abound. As Java has modernized, certain changes have occurred.\nOne important change has been the spread of the national language, Bahasa\nIndonesia, a more \u2018democratic\u2019 language. Bahasa Indonesia already dominates\nthe political life of Java because it enables people to talk about issues without\nhaving to choose a particular level of speech which necessarily conveys attitudes\nthey might not want to convey. However, there is no reason to assume that\nJavanese itself will change and that the various levels will disappear. Rather, the\nspread of Bahasa Indonesia in Java may best be seen as offering a choice to\nthose who know both Javanese and Bahasa Indonesia. As Geertz says (p. 259),\nBahasa Indonesia \u2018seems destined, at least in the short run, to become part of\nthe general Javanese linguistic system, to become one more type of sentence\namong those available, to be selected for use in certain special contexts and for\ncertain special purposes.\u2019\nOne thing that is not clear in the above analysis is just which aspects of usage\ncome from the requirements of positive politeness and which from the require-\nments of negative politeness. There is reason to believe that many choices in\nJavanese are determined by a wider need to maintain the existing social arrange-\nment rather than by any individual\u2019s need to address his or her momentarywants.\nJapan offers us another example.\nThe Japanese are also always described as being an extremely polite people.\nMartin (1964) has summarized some of the ways in which the Japanese use\nlanguage to show this politeness: honorific forms incorporating negatives (ana-\nlogous to English \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you like to...?\u2019) are more polite than thosewithout\nnegatives; the longer the utterance the more polite it is felt to be; utterances with\nlocal dialect in them are less polite and those with a few Chinese loan words\nin them are more polite; you are more polite to strangers than to acquaintances;\nyour gender determines your use of honorifics, with men differentiating more\nthan women among the available honorifics; whereas knowledge of honorifics\nis associated with education, attitudes toward using them vary with age; polite-\nness is most expected when women address men, the young address the old, and\nmembers of the lower classes address members of the upper classes, with the\nlast, i.e., class differences, overriding the first two; and, although people may\nsay that it is inappropriate to use honorifics with your relatives, they still use\nthem. Martin says that there are four basic factors at work here: in choosing the\nproper, or polite, address term for another, a Japanese considers out-groupness,\nsocial position, age difference, and gender difference in that order. Martin ob-\nserves that anyone who comes to such a complicated system of politeness and\naddress from a simple one may get \u2018the feeling that Japanese conversation is all\nformula, with no content\u2019 (p. 407). To the argument that such a complicated\nsystem must necessarily give way \u2018as feudalism is replaced by democracy,\u2019 Martin\nreplies that \u2018we shall probably have speech levels in Japanese...as long as we\nhave plurals in English\u2019 (p. 412).\nThe Japanese are very polite. But how much of that politeness is negative\npoliteness? According to Matsumoto (1989) and Ide (1989), perhaps not a great\ndeal. Both argue that the concept does not offer the best explanation of what\nAITC11 280 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 281\nis happening. The Japanese are always very much aware of the social context\nof every utterance they use. They are brought up to use wakimae \u2018discernment,\u2019\ni.e., how to do the right thing socially, so personal face requirements, if any, are\npushed into the background. The evidence to support this claim and a similar\nclaim by Nwoye (1992) concerning the Igbo of Nigeria is suggestive rather than\nconclusive. However, it does remind us that while people must be polite every-\nwhere they are not necessarily polite in the same way or for the same reasons.\nFor example, a recent study (Sreetharan, 2004) of the use of a nonstandard\nvariety of Japanese by men in the Kansai (western) region of Japan revealed that\nin all-male situations while young men between the ages of 19 and 23 preferred\nto use forms of speech that are stereotypically masculine, older men between 24\nand 68 tended to avoid such language. Indeed, the older they were, the greater\nthe preference for polite, traditionally feminine forms. They thereby cultivated\na polite image, no longer needing to project their masculinity (and the power\nassociated with that) through their language.\nWe can turn to a European language, French, to show still another aspect of\npoliteness. In Savoir-vivre en France (Vigner, 1978) we find some examples that\nclearly illustrate how longer utterances are considered to be more polite than\nshorter ones in certain circumstances. For example, in asking someone to pick\nyou up at three o\u2019clock, you can say each of the following (pp. 77\u20138):\nA trois heures, avec votre voiture.\n\u2018At three o\u2019clock, with your car.\u2019\nVous voudriez bien venir me prendre \u00e0 trois heures avec votre voiture.\n\u2018You should come and get me at three o\u2019clock with your car.\u2019\nPourriez-vous venir me prendre \u00e0 trois heures avec votre voiture?\n\u2018Could you come and get me at three o\u2019clock with your car?\u2019\nThe first sentence is not at all polite; in the last sentence there is a further\nsoftening through choice of the question format. Asking a stranger on the street\nthe way to the Gare de Lyon, you can say (pp. 79\u201380):\nLa Gare de Lyon?\n\u2018Lyon Station?\u2019\nPour aller \u00e0 la Gare de Lyon, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet?\n\u2018The way to Lyon Station, please?\u2019\nPourriez-vous m\u2019indiquer le chemin pour me rendre \u00e0 la Gare de Lyon?\n\u2018Could you tell me which way I should go for Lyon Station?\u2019\nAuriez-vous l\u2019obligeance de bien vouloir m\u2019indiquer le chemin pour me rendre\n\u00e0 la Gare de Lyon?\n\u2018Would you be so obliging as to want to inform me which way I should go\nfor Lyon Station?\u2019\nWhereas the first request is almost certainly too abrupt, the last is almost cer-\ntainly too obsequious. Finally, you enter an office and must disturb someone\nwho is working there to find out where exactly you should go (pp. 80\u20131):\nAITC11 281 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 282 Solidarity and Politeness\nLe service des bourses?\n\u2018The Finance Office?\u2019\nPardon, le service des bourses, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet?\n\u2018Excuse me, the Finance Office, please?\u2019\nJe m\u2019excuse de vous d\u00e9ranger, mais pourriez-vous m\u2019indiquer le service des\nbourses, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet?\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry for disturbing you, but would you tell me where the Finance Office\nis, please?\u2019\nAccording to Vigner (p. 88), this French politeness formula is made up of three\ncomponents: (1) an initial mitigating component (which can be short, e.g., Pouvez-\nvous, or long, e.g., Est-ce que vous voudriez bien) or its absence; (2) the central\nrequest or order component; and (3) a final component, the presence or absence\nof something like s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet. You can therefore have each of the following:\n\u00d8 \u2013 request \u2013 \u00d8\n\u00d8 \u2013 request \u2013 final\nshort mitigator \u2013 request \u2013 final\nlong mitigator \u2013 request \u2013 final\nRequests made in the form \u00d8 \u2013 request \u2013 \u00d8 are therefore power-loaded, or\nimpolite, or both; requests made in the form, long mitigator \u2013 request \u2013 final,\nmay be so polite as to appear to be overdone. Notice that a request by a\nsuperior to an inferior put in this last form is likely to be interpreted as sarcastic:\n\u2018Would you mind, Mr Smith, if I asked you to try occasionally to get to work\non time, please?\u2019\nPoliteness is a very important principle in language use; we must consider\nothers\u2019 feelings. The next chapter will again take up the issue of politeness and\ntry to place it in a still broader context.\nIn using a language, we make use of the devices that the language employs\nto show certain relationships to others and our attitudes toward them. Indeed,\nto use the language properly, we must do so. In using French, we cannot avoid\nthe tu\u2013vous distinction; in communicating in English, we must refer to others\nand address them on occasion; in speaking Javanese or Japanese, we must\nobserve the conventions having to do with the correct choice of speech level and\nhonorifics. It is quite possible that we may not like what we must do and find\nthe demands made either onerous or undemocratic, or both. It is also possible\nthat such systems will change over a period of time, but that kind of change is\nslow and, when it does occur, as we saw with the example from China, not at\nall easy. There seems to be little doubt that language use and certain aspects of\nsocial structure are intimately related. The exact nature of that relationship may\ncontinue to intrigue us. That is, do speakers of Javanese and Japanese behave\nthe way they do because their languages require them to do so, or do their lin-\nguistic choices follow inevitably from the social structures they have developed,\nor is it a bit of both? Was Whorf right, wrong, or partly right? I will, of course,\nleave these questions unanswered once more.\nAITC11 282 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Solidarity and Politeness 283\nDiscussion\n1. Martin states a number of principles that govern politeness in Japanese. Do\nwe have anything at all equivalent in English?\n2. Refer back to Martin\u2019s observation concerning Japanese speech levels\nand English plurals. How valid is Martin\u2019s point? Look at what is actually\nsaid in such a long polite utterance as \u2018Would I be bothering you awfully\nif I asked you to move over one seat?\u2019 What makes it so polite? Give some\nother examples. Contrast these polite utterances with some impoliteness.\n3. Record a conversation. Note all the signs of politeness. Take them out.\nWhat are you left with? How does the resulting conversation sound, i.e.,\nwhat is its effect? Alternatively, record an impolite exchange and try to\nspecify exactly why it is impolite.\n4. If more polite utterances tend to be longer than less polite ones, how do you\naccount for the fact that people who live and work very closely with each\nother often communicate effectively (and politely) with very few words?\nRefer to the concept of \u2018phatic communion\u2019 (see pp. 286\u20137).\n5. Observe how young children address each other and try to describe their\n\u2018rules of politeness.\u2019 Contrast these rules with those of their parents. How\ndo you learn to be polite?\n6. Try to work out some of the difficulties one might experience in giving and\nreceiving compliments, particularly the \u2018power\u2019 and \u2018solidarity\u2019 issues. In\nwhat ways do compliments given in symmetrical relationships differ from\nthose given in asymmetrical relationships?\n7. It has been said that an apology is a special kind of politeness device that\naddresses the face needs of a hearer or hearers when some kind of offense\nhas been given. Analyze some offenses and apologies from this perspective.\nFurther Reading\nIn addition to the sources cited in the text, Friedrich (1972) provides interest-\ning data on the T\/V distinction in Russian, and M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler and Harr\u00e9 (1990)\nexamine T\/V usage at length.

(1994).\nAITC11 283 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 284 Talk and Action\n12 Talk and Action\nIn speaking to one another, we make use of sentences, or, to be more precise,\nutterances. We can attempt to classify these utterances in any one of a variety\nof ways. We can try to classify them by length, e.g., by counting the number of\nwords in each utterance, but that appears to be of little interest except to those\nwho believe that shorter utterances are more easily understood than longer ones.\nWe can try to classify them by grammatical structure along a number of dimen-\nsions, e.g., their clausal type and complexity: active\u2013passive; statement\u2013question\u2013\nrequest\u2013exclamatory; various combinations of these; and so on. We may even\ntry to work out a semantic or logical structure for each utterance. But it is also\npossible to attempt a classification in terms of what sentences do, i.e., to take\na \u2018functional\u2019 approach, but one that goes somewhat beyond consideration of\nsuch functions as stating, questioning, requesting, and exclaiming. In recent\nyears a number of philosophers have had interesting things to say about what\nutterances do as well as mean, observing that part of the total meaning is this\nvery doing.\nAs soon as we look closely at conversation in general, we see that it involves\nmuch more than using language to state propositions or convey facts. We also\nvery rarely use language monologically and such uses are clearly marked. The\nunmarked use is dialogical, i.e., with another or others in various kinds of\nverbal give-and-take which we call conversation (see also p. 114). Through\nconversation we establish relationships with others, achieve a measure of\ncooperation (or fail to do so), keep channels open for further relationships, and\nso on. The utterances we use in conversation enable us to do these kinds of\nthings because conversation itself has certain properties which are well worth\nexamining. Our concern in this chapter is therefore twofold: we will be con-\ncerned both with what utterances do and how they can be used, and, specific-\nally, with how we use them in conversation.\nSpeech Acts\nOne thing that many utterances do is make propositions: they do this mainly in\nthe form of either statements or questions but other grammatical forms are also\nAITC12 284 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 285\npossible. Each of the following is a proposition: \u2018I had a busy day today,\u2019 \u2018Have\nyou called your mother?,\u2019 and \u2018Your dinner\u2019s ready!\u2019 Such utterances areconnected\nin some way with events or happenings in a possible world, i.e., one that can\nbe experienced or imagined, a world in which such propositions can be said to\nbe either true or false. They have been called constative utterances.\nA different kind of proposition is the ethical proposition, e.g., \u2018Big boys don\u2019t\ncry,\u2019 \u2018God is love,\u2019 \u2018Thou shalt not kill,\u2019 \u2018You must tell the truth,\u2019 and even\n\u2018Beethoven is better than Brahms.\u2019 Just like an ordinary proposition, an ethical\nproposition may be true or false, although not in the same sense. But truth and\nfalsity are not the real purpose of ethical propositions; their real purpose is to\nserve as guides to behavior in some world or other. \u2018Big boys don\u2019t cry\u2019 is\nobviously value-laden in a way in which \u2018Your dinner\u2019s ready!\u2019 definitely is not.\nAnother kind of utterance is the \u2018phatic\u2019 type, e.g., \u2018Nice day!,\u2019 \u2018How do youdo?,\u2019\nand \u2018You\u2019re looking smart today!\u2019 We employ such utterances not for their pro-\npositional content but rather for their affective value as indicators that oneperson\nis willing to talk to another and that a channel of communication is either being\nopened or being kept open. Phatic utterances do not really communicateanything;\nrather, their use allows communication to occur should there be anything of\nconsequence to say. I will have a little more to say on this matter shortly.\nAustin (1975), a philosopher, distinguished still another kind of utterancefrom\nthese, the performative utterance. In using a performative utterance, a person is\nnot just saying something but is actually doing something if certain real-world\nconditions are met. To say \u2018I name this ship \u201cLiberty Bell\u201d\u2019 in certain circum-\nstances is to name a ship. To say \u2018I do\u2019 in other circumstances is to find oneself\na husband or a wife \u2013 or a bigamist. To hear someone say to you \u2018I sentence\nyou to five years in jail\u2019 in still other circumstances is to look forward to a rather\nbleak future. Such utterances perform acts: the naming of ships, marrying, and\nsentencing in these cases. A speech act changes in some way the conditions that\nexist in the world. It does something, and it is not something that in itself is\neither true or false. Truth and falsity may be claims made about its having been\ndone, but they cannot be made about the actual doing.\nAustin pointed out that the \u2018circumstances\u2019 mentioned above can beprescribed.\nHe mentions certain felicity conditions that performatives must meet to be\nsuccessful. First, a conventional procedure must exist for doing whatever is to\nbe done, and that procedure must specify who must say and do what and in\nwhat circumstances. Second, all participants must properly execute this proced-\nure and carry it through to completion. Finally, the necessary thoughts, feelings,\nand intentions must be present in all parties. In general, the spoken part of the\ntotal act, the actual speech act, will take the grammatical form of having a first-\nperson subject and a verb in the present tense; it may or may not also includethe\nword hereby. Examples are \u2018I (hereby) name,\u2019 \u2018We decree,\u2019 and \u2018I swear.\u2019 This\nkind of utterance is explicitly performative when it is employed in aconventional\nframework, such as naming ships, making royal proclamations, and taking an\noath in court.\nThere are also less explicit performatives. Declarations like \u2018I promise,\u2019 \u2018I\napologize,\u2019 or \u2018I warn you\u2019 have many of the same characteristics as the previ-\nously mentioned utterances but lack any associated conventional procedure; for\nAITC12 285 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 286 Talk and Action\nanyone can promise, apologize, and warn, and there is no way of specifying the\ncircumstances quite so narrowly as in naming ships, proclaiming, or swearing\nan oath. It is also on occasion possible to use other grammatical forms than the\ncombination of first person and present tense. \u2018Thin ice,\u2019 \u2018Savage dog,\u2019 \u2018Slippery\nwhen wet,\u2019 and \u2018Loitering is forbidden\u2019 are all very obviously warnings, so to\nthat extent they are performatives. What we can observe, then, is that, in con-\ntrast to constative utterances, that is, utterances which are often used to assert\npropositions and which may be true or false, they are used either appropriately\nor inappropriately and, if used appropriately, their very utterance is the doing\nof the whole or part of an action.\nAustin divides performatives into five categories: (1) verdictives, typified by\nthe giving of a verdict, estimate, grade, or appraisal (\u2018We find the accused\nguilty\u2019); (2) exercitives, the exercising of powers, rights, or influences as in\nappointing, ordering, warning, or advising (\u2018I pronounce you husband and wife\u2019);\n(3) commissives, typified by promising or undertaking, and committing one to\ndo something by, for example, announcing an intention or espousing a cause\n(\u2018I hereby bequeath\u2019); (4) behabitives, having to do with such matters as apolo-\ngizing, congratulating, blessing, cursing, or challenging (\u2018I apologize\u2019); and\n(5) expositives, a term used to refer to how one makes utterances fit into an\nargument or exposition (\u2018I argue,\u2019 \u2018I reply,\u2019 or \u2018I assume\u2019).\nOnce we begin to look at utterances from the point of view of what they\ndo, it is possible to see every utterance as a speech act of one kind or other, that\nis, as having some functional value which might be quite independent of the\nactual words used and their grammatical arrangement. These acts may not be\nas explicit or direct as \u2018Out!,\u2019 \u2018I do,\u2019 or \u2018We hereby seek leave to appeal\u2019 butthere\ncan be little dispute that even to say something like \u2018I saw John this morning\u2019\nis an act; at the simplest level it is an act of telling the truth (or what you believe\nto be the truth) or not. There is also no reason to assume that every language\nhas the same performatives. Although it is unlikely that a language will be with-\nout performatives for ordering, promising, and challenging, it is quite easy to see\nit doing without those for baptizing, naming ships, passing jail sentences, and\nmaking bets. Performativity almost certainly varies by culture.\nWe can now return to expressions like \u2018Nice day!,\u2019 \u2018How do you do?,\u2019 and\n\u2018You\u2019re looking smart today.\u2019 A specific kind of speech is the kind we havereferred\nto previously as phatic communion. According to Malinowski (1923, p. 315),\nphatic communion is a type of speech in which ties of union are created by a\nmere exchange of words. In such communion words do not conveymeanings.\nInstead, \u2018they fulfill a social function, and that is their principal aim.\u2019 What,there-\nfore, is the function of apparently aimless gossip? Malinowski answers asfollows:\nIt consists in just this atmosphere of sociability and in the fact of the personal\ncommunion of these people. But this is in fact achieved by speech, and the situation\nin all such cases is created by the exchange of words, by the specific feelings which\nform convivial gregariousness, by the give and take of utterances which make up\nordinary gossip. The whole situation consists in what happens linguistically. Each\nutterance is an act serving the direct aim of binding hearer to speaker by a tie of\nsome social sentiment or other. Once more, language appears to us in this function\nnot as an instrument of reflection but as a mode of action.\nAITC12 286 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 287\nMalinowski himself uses the word act in this explanation. In phatic communion,\ntherefore, we have still another instance of language being used to dosomething,\nnot just to say something. (See also Cheepen, 1988, pp. 14\u201319.)\nAccording to Searle (1969, pp. 23\u20134), we perform different kinds of acts\nwhen we speak. The utterances we use are locutions. Most locutions expresssome\nintent that a speaker has. They are illocutionary acts and have an illocutionary\nforce. A speaker can also use different locutions to achieve the same illocutionary\nforce or use one locution for many different purposes. Schiffrin (1994, ch. 3) has\na very good example of the latter. She shows how one form, \u2018Y\u2019want a piece of\ncandy?\u2019 can perform many functions as a speech act, including question,request,\nand offer. In contrast, we can see how different forms can perform a single\nfunction since it is quite possible to ask someone to close the door with different\nwords: \u2018It\u2019s cold in here,\u2019 \u2018The door\u2019s open,\u2019 and \u2018Could someone see to the\ndoor?\u2019 Illocutions also often cause listeners to do things. To that extent they\nare perlocutions. If you say \u2018I bet you a dollar he\u2019ll win\u2019 and I say \u2018On,\u2019 your\nillocutionary act of offering a bet has led to my perlocutionary uptake ofaccepting\nit. The perlocutionary force of your words is to get me to bet, and you have\nsucceeded.\nSearle (1999, pp. 145\u20136) says that illocutionary acts must be performed\n\u2018intentionally.\u2019 In order to communicate something in a language that will be\nunderstood by another speaker of that language as an utterance it must (1) be\ncorrectly uttered with its conventional meaning and (2) satisfy a truth condition,\ni.e., if it is \u2018It is raining\u2019 it must indeed be raining, and the hearer should\nrecognize the truth of (1) and (2): \u2018if the hearer knows the language, recognizes\nmy intention to produce a sentence of the language, and recognizes that I amnot\nmerely uttering that sentence but that I also mean what I say, then I will have\nsucceeded in communicating to the hearer that it is raining.\u2019 Searle also recasts\nAustin\u2019s five categories of performative (here repeated in parentheses) by what\nhe calls their point or purpose: assertives (expositives), which commit the hearer\nto the truth of a proposition; directives (verdictives), which get the hearer tobelieve\nin such a way as to make his or her behavior match the propositional content\nof the directive; commissives (commissives), which commit the speaker to under-\ntake a course of action represented in the propositional content; expressives\n(behabitives), which express the sincerity conditions of the speech act; and\ndeclaratives (exercitives), which bring about a change in the world byrepresenting\nit as having been changed.\nIf we look at how we perform certain kinds of acts rather than at how\nparticular types of utterances perform acts, we can, as Searle (1975) has indi-\ncated, categorize at least six ways in which we can make requests or give orders\neven indirectly. There are utterance types that focus on the hearer\u2019s ability to do\nsomething (\u2018Can you pass the salt?\u2019; \u2018Have you got change for a dollar?\u2019); those\nthat focus on the speaker\u2019s wish or desire that the hearer will do something\n(\u2018I would like you to go now\u2019; \u2018I wish you wouldn\u2019t do that\u2019); those that focus\non the hearer\u2019s actually doing something (\u2018Officers will henceforth wear ties at\ndinner\u2019; \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to eat your cereal?\u2019); those that focus on the hearer\u2019s\nwillingness or desire to do something (\u2018Would you be willing to write a letter\nof recommendation for me?\u2019; \u2018Would you mind not making so much noise?\u2019);\nAITC12 287 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 288 Talk and Action\nthose that focus on the reasons for doing something (\u2018You\u2019re standing on my\nfoot\u2019; \u2018It might help if you shut up\u2019); and, finally, those that embed one of the\nabove types inside another (\u2018I would appreciate it if you could make less noise\u2019;\n\u2018Might I ask you to take off your hat?\u2019). As Searle says (1999, p. 151), \u2018one can\nperform one speech act indirectly by performing another directly.\u2019\nSearle has concentrated his work on speech acts on how a hearer perceives a\nparticular utterance to have the force it has, what he calls the \u2018uptake\u2019 of an\nutterance. In particular, what makes a promise a promise? For Searle there are\nfive rules that govern promise-making. The first, the propositional content rule,\nis that the words must predicate a future action of the speaker. The second and\nthird, the preparatory rules, require that both the person promising and the\nperson to whom the promise is made must want the act done and that it would\nnot otherwise be done. Moreover, the person promising believes he or she can\ndo what is promised. The fourth, the sincerity rule, requires the promiser to\nintend to perform the act, that is, to be placed under some kind of obligation;\nand the fifth, the essential rule, says that the uttering of the words counts as\nundertaking an obligation to perform the action.\nIf this view is correct, it should be possible to state the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for every illocutionary act. Many of these require that the parties to\nacts be aware of social obligations involved in certain relationships. They may\nalso make reference to certain other kinds of knowledge we must assume the\nparties have if the act is to be successful. For example, a command such as\n\u2018Stand up!\u2019 from A to B can be felicitous only if B is not standing up, can stand\nup, and has an obligation to stand up if A so requests, and if A has a valid\nreason to make B stand up. Both A and B must recognize the validity of all these\nconditions if \u2018Stand up!\u2019 is to be used and interpreted as a proper command. We\nshould note that breaking any one of the conditions makes \u2018Stand up!\u2019 invalid:\nB is already standing up, is crippled (and A is not a faith healer!), outranks A,\nor is at least A\u2019s equal, or A has no reason that appears valid to B so that\nstanding up appears unjustified, unnecessary, and uncalled for.\nThese kinds of conditions for illocutionary acts resemble what have been\ncalled constitutive rules rather than regulative rules (Rawls, 1955). Regulative\nrules are things like laws and regulations passed by governments and legislative\nbodies: they regulate what is right and wrong and sometimes prescribe sanctions\nif and when the rules are broken, e.g., \u2018Trespassing is forbidden\u2019 or \u2018Noparking.\u2019\nConstitutive rules, on the other hand, are like the rules of baseball, chess, or\nsoccer: they actually define a particular activity in the form of \u2018doing X countsas\nY\u2019 so that if, in certain prescribed circumstances, you strike a ball in a particular\nway or succeed in moving it into a certain place, that counts as a \u2018hit\u2019 or a\u2018goal.\u2019\nThe rules constitute the game: without them the game does not exist. In thesame\nway, speech acts are what they are because saying something counts assomething\nif certain conditions prevail. As Schiffrin (1994, p. 60) says, \u2018Language can do\nthings \u2013 can perform acts \u2013 because people share constitutive rules that create\nthe acts and that allow them to label utterances as particular kinds of acts.\u2019\nIn contrast to Austin, who focused his attention on how speakers realize their\nintentions in speaking, Searle focuses on how listeners respond to utterances,\nthat is, how one person tries to figure out how another is using a particular\nAITC12 288 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 289\nutterance. Is what is heard a promise, a warning, an assertion, a request, or\nsomething else? What is the illocutionary force of a particular utterance? What\nwe see in both Austin and Searle is a recognition that people use language to\nachieve a variety of objectives. If we want to understand what they hope to\naccomplish, we must be prepared to take into account factors that range far\nbeyond the actual linguistic form of any particular utterance. A speaker\u2019s intent,\nor perceived intent, is also important, as are the social circumstances that appar-\nently determine that, if factors X, Y, and Z are present, then utterance A counts\nas an example of P, but if X, Y, and W are present, then the same utterance\ncounts as an example of Q. We can see that this is the case if we consider pro-\nmises and threats: these share many of the same characteristics, but they must\ndiffer in at least one essential characteristic or there would be no distinction.\nDiscussion\n1. Austin specified certain felicity conditions if performatives are to succeed.\nHe says that if either of the first conditions is not met we have a misfire,\nbut if the third is not met we have an abuse. Why do you think he chose\nthose terms? Can you give some examples from your own experience of\nmisfires and abuses?\n2. Standing by the side of a swimming pool, you say to a small girl \u2018Can you\nswim?\u2019 expecting either \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 as an answer. However, she jumps into\nthe water instead. Explain how she interpreted your words. Does the same\nexplanation hold for the reply \u2018I\u2019ll bring you one in a minute\u2019 rather than\n\u2018Yes, we don\u2019t need any\u2019 to the question, \u2018Is there any beer in the fridge?\u2019\n3. Why may each of the following be said to fail in some way as a\nperformative?\na. I sentence you to five years of misery.\nb. I promise you I\u2019ll kill you.\nc. I baptize this dog \u2018Fido.\u2019\nd. I pronounce you husband and wife (said by the captain of the Dover\u2013\nCalais ferry somewhere in the English Channel).\ne. I order you to stop (small boy to dog).\nf. I congratulate you for your failure to win the cup.\ng. I order you to resume breathing.\n4. What observations can you make about the relationship of grammatical\nform and speaker\u2019s intent from data such as the following?\na. Have you tidied up your room yet?\nb. When do you plan to tidy up your room?\nc. Don\u2019t you think your room\u2019s a mess?\nd. Are you planning to do anything about your room?\ne. Can you go upstairs and tidy up your room?\nf. Would you mind tidying up your room?\nAITC12 289 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 290 Talk and Action\ng. Wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to tidy up your room?\nh. Go and tidy up your room.\ni. Your room needs tidying up.\nj. If you don\u2019t tidy up your room, you don\u2019t go out.\nk. Tidy up your room and you can have some ice cream.\nl. Upstairs, and tidy up your room right now.\nm. Kids who can\u2019t keep their rooms tidy don\u2019t get ice cream.\n5. Searle says that neither of the following is a promise: a teacher says to a lazy\nstudent, \u2018If you don\u2019t hand in your paper on time, I promise you I will give\nyou a failing grade in the course\u2019; a person accused of stealing money says\n\u2018No, I didn\u2019t, I promise you I didn\u2019t.\u2019 Why does Searle adopt this view even\nthough in each case we have an instance of I promise? He also says that a\nhappily married man who promises his wife that he will not desert her in\nthe next week is likely to provide more anxiety than comfort. Again, why\nis this the case?\n6. Gordon and Lakoff (1975, p. 85) argue that a listener will not understand\nthe following sentences as requests to take out the garbage. Why not? How\nmight a listener understand each sentence? Why?\na. Are you likely to take out the garbage?\nb. I suppose you\u2019re going to take out the garbage.\nc. Must you take out the garbage?\nd. Ought you to take out the garbage?\n7. Austin and Searle appear to be making a claim about all languages, i.e., that\nevery language will be like every other language in the range of \u2018speech acts\u2019\nit permits. However, Wittgenstein (1958, p. 11) claims that \u2018new types of\nlanguage, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and\nothers become obsolete and get forgotten.\u2019 What kinds of evidence would\nbe necessary to test between these claims?\nCooperation\nWe can view utterances as acts of various kinds and the exchanges of utterances\nthat we call conversations as exchanges of acts, not just exchanges of words,\nalthough they are this too. However, we may well ask how we can make such\nexchanges without achieving some prior agreement concerning the very prin-\nciples of exchange. In fact, we do not. According to philosophers such as Grice,\nwe are able to converse with one another because we recognize common goals\nin conversation and specific ways of achieving these goals. In any conversation,\nonly certain kinds of \u2018moves\u2019 are possible at any particular time because of the\nconstraints that operate to govern exchanges. These constraints limit speakers as\nto what they can say and listeners as to what they can infer.\nAITC12 290 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 291\nGrice (1975, p. 45) maintains that the overriding principle in conversation is\none he calls the cooperative principle: \u2018Make your conversational contribution\nsuch as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or\ndirection of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.\u2019 You must therefore\nact in conversation in accord with a general principle that you are mutually\nengaged with your listener or listeners in an activity that is of benefit to all, that\nbenefit being mutual understanding.\nGrice lists four maxims that follow from the cooperative principle: quantity,\nquality, relation, and manner. The maxim of quantity requires you to make your\ncontribution as informative as is required. The maxim of quality requires you\nnot to say what you believe to be false or that for which you lack adequate\nevidence. Relation is the simple injunction: be relevant. Manner requires you to\navoid obscurity of expression and ambiguity, and to be brief and orderly. This\nprinciple and these maxims characterize ideal exchanges. Such exchanges would\nalso observe certain other principles too, such as \u2018Be polite.\u2019\nGrice points out (p. 47) that these maxims do not apply to conversationalone.\nHe says:\nit may be worth noting that the specific expectations or presumptions connected\nwith at least some of the foregoing maxims have their analogs in the sphere of\ntransactions that are not talk exchanges. I list briefly one such analog for each\nconversational category.\n1. Quantity. If you are assisting me to mend a car, I expect your contribution\nto be neither more nor less than is required; if, for example, at a particular\nstage I need four screws, I expect you to hand me four, rather than two\nor six.\n2. Quality. I expect your contributions to be genuine and not spurious. If I need\nsugar as an ingredient in the cake you are assisting me to make, I do not\nexpect you to hand me salt; if I need a spoon, I do not expect a trick spoon\nmade of rubber.\n3. Relation. I expect a partner\u2019s contribution to be appropriate to immediate\nneeds at each stage of the transaction; if I am mixing ingredients for a cake,\nI do not expect to be handed a good book, or even an oven cloth (though this\nmight be an appropriate contribution at a later stage).\n4. Manner. I expect a partner to make it clear what contribution he is making,\nand to execute his performance with reasonable dispatch.\nWhat we can observe, therefore, is that the maxims are involved in all kinds of\nrational cooperative behavior: we assume the world works according to a set of\nmaxims or rules which we have internalized, and we generally do our best to\nmake it work in that way. There is nothing special about conversation when we\nview it in such a way.\nOf course, everyday speech often occurs in less than ideal circumstances.\nGrice points out that speakers do not always follow the maxims he hasdescribed,\nand, as a result, they may implicate something rather different from what they\nactually say. They may violate, exploit, or opt out of one of the maxims, or two\nof the maxims may clash in a particular instance. Grice offers the following\nAITC12 291 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 292 Talk and Action\nexamples (pp. 51\u20133). In the first set he says that no maxim is violated, for B\u2019s\nresponse in each case is an adequate response to A\u2019s remark:\nA: I am out of petrol.\nB: There is a garage round the corner.\nA: Smith doesn\u2019t seem to have a girlfriend these days.\nB: He has been paying a lot of visits to New York lately.\nHe gives further examples, however, in which there is a deliberate exploitation\nof a maxim. For example, a testimonial letter praising a candidate\u2019s minor\nqualities and entirely ignoring those that might be relevant to the position for\nwhich the candidate is being considered flouts the maxim of quantity, just as\ndoes protesting your innocence too strongly. Other examples are ironic, meta-\nphoric, or hyperbolic in nature: \u2018You\u2019re a fine friend\u2019 said to someone who has\njust let you down; \u2018You are the cream in my coffee\u2019; and \u2018Every nice girl loves\na sailor.\u2019 What we do in understanding an utterance is to ask ourselves just what\nis appropriate in terms of these maxims in a particular set of circumstances.\nWe assess the literal content of the utterance and try to achieve some kind of\nfit between it and the maxims. Consequently, the answer to the question, \u2018Why\nis X telling me this in this way?\u2019 is part of reaching a decision about what\nexactly X is telling me. To use one of Grice\u2019s examples (p. 55), if, instead of\nSmith saying to you that \u2018Miss X sang \u201cHome Sweet Home,\u201d\u2019 he says \u2018Miss X\nproduced a series of sounds that corresponded closely with the score of \u201cHome\nSweet Home,\u201d\u2019 you will observe that Smith\u2019s failure to be brief helps damn Miss\nX\u2019s performance.\nThe theory of implicature explains how, when A says something to B, B will\nunderstand A\u2019s remarks in a certain way because B will recognize that A said\nmore than was required, or gave a seemingly irrelevant reply, or deliberately\nobfuscated the issue. B will interpret what A says as a cooperative act of a par-\nticular kind in the ongoing exchange between A and B, but that cooperation\nmay be shown somewhat indirectly. B will have to figure out the way in which\nA\u2019s utterance is to be fitted into their ongoing exchange, and B\u2019s operating\nassumption will be that the utterance is coherent, that sense can be made of\nit, and that the principles necessary to do so are available. The task is never an\nunprincipled one: Grice\u2019s maxims provide the necessary interpretive framework\nwithin which to establish the relevance of utterances to each other because these\n\u2018principles operate even when being flouted\u2019 (Levinson, 2001, p. 141). What is\nleft unsaid may be just as important as what is said.\nHowever, when we try to apply any set of principles, no matter what kind\nthey are, to show how utterances work when sequenced into what we call con-\nversations, we run into a variety of difficulties. Ordinary casual conversation is\npossibly the most common of all language activities. We are constantly talking\nto one another about this or that. Sometimes the person addressed is an intimate\nfriend, at other times a more casual acquaintance, and at still other times a\ncomplete stranger. But we still manage conversation. Because it is such a com-\nmonplace activity, we tend not to think about conversation from the point of\nAITC12 292 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 293\nview of how it is organized, i.e., how particular conversations \u2018work\u2019 is beneath\nour conscious awareness unless we are one of those who have tried to \u2018improve\u2019\nour conversational ability by taking courses in self-improvement or by reading\ncertain books on the topic. Such courses and books have their own focus: they\ntend to concentrate on the subject matter of talk, on \u2018correct\u2019 pronunciation,\ndiction, and grammar, and on matters of personal taste and behavior. They very\nrarely tell us anything very informative about how we actually manage conversa-\ntions, i.e., what makes a particular conversation work. They are examples of\nwhat Cameron (1995) calls \u2018verbal hygiene\u2019 (see p. 53).\nA commonplace activity is one that occurs frequently and is easilyrecognizable.\nIt must also conform to certain principles which we may or may not be able\nto state explicitly. Many activities are commonplace by this definition: eating,\nsleeping, going to work, passing one another in the street, shopping, and,\nof course, conversing, to cite but a few. We also recognize that in many cases\nsome people are more successful than others in dealing with the commonplace\naspects of life. So far as conversation is concerned, we recognize the fact that\nsome people are better conversationalists than others, but at the same time we\nmay find it difficult to say what makes some better and others worse. In addi-\ntion, most of us are sensitive to bizarre conversational behavior in others, but\nwe may not always be able to say why a particular piece of speaking strikes\nus as odd. It is only by attempting to state explicitly the principles that appear\nto operate in conversations that we can explain these various judgments and\nreactions.\nAbove all, conversation is a cooperative activity in the Gricean sense, one\nthat depends on speakers and listeners sharing a set of assumptions about what\nis happening. If anything went in conversation, nothing would happen. The\nwhole activity would be entirely unpredictable and there would be too much\nuncertainty to make conversations either worthwhile or pleasant. Not anything\ngoes; indeed, many things do not occur and cannot occur because they would\nviolate the unconscious agreement that holds between speakers and listeners\nthat only certain kinds of things will happen in a normal conversation and that\nboth speakers and listeners will hold to that agreement. Conversation makes use\nof the cooperative principle; speakers and listeners are guided by considerations\nof quantity, quality, and so on, and the process of implicature which allows\nthem to figure out relationships between the said and the unsaid. Grice\u2019sprinciples,\ntherefore, form a fundamental part of any understanding of conversation as a\ncooperative activity. (See Sperber and Wilson, 1995, for an interesting extension\nof many of these ideas into a cognitively oriented theory of \u2018relevance\u2019 and\nClark (1996) for an approach which has as its thesis that language use is a form\nof joint action located within social activities.)\nConversation is cooperative also in the sense that speakers and listeners tend\nto accept each other for what they claim to be: that is, they accept the face that\nthe other offers (see p. 276). That face may vary according to circumstances, for\nat one time the face you offer me may be that of a \u2018close friend,\u2019 on another\noccasion a \u2018teacher,\u2019 and on a third occasion a \u2018young woman,\u2019 but it is a face\nwhich I will generally accept. I will judge your words against the face you are\npresenting, and it is very likely that we will both agree that you are at a\nAITC12 293 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 294 Talk and Action\nparticular moment presenting a certain face to me and I am presenting a certain\nface to you. We will be involved in face-work, the work of presenting faces to\neach other, protecting our own face, and protecting the other\u2019s face. We will be\nplaying out a little drama together and cooperating to see that nothing mars the\nperformance. That is the norm.\nOf course, one party may violate that norm. I can refuse to accept you for\nwhat you claim to be, deny your right to the face you are attempting to present,\nand even challenge you about it. I may also regard your face as inappropriate\nor insincere, but say nothing, reserving my judgments about your demeanor and\nwords to myself. The second course of action is the more usual; challenging\nsomeone about the face he or she is presenting is generally avoided, and those\nwho make a regular practice of it quickly find themselves unwelcome almost\neverywhere \u2013 even to each other! Conversation therefore involves a considerable\namount of role-playing: we choose a role for ourselves in each conversation,\ndiscover the role or roles the other or the others are playing, and then proceed\nto construct a little dramatic encounter, much of which involves respecting\nothers\u2019 faces. All the world is a stage, and we are players!\nWe do get some help in trying to decide what face another is presenting\nto us and what role is being attempted, but it requires us to have certain skills.\nAs Laver and Trudgill (1979, p. 28) observe, \u2018Being a listener to speech is not\nunlike being a detective. The listener not only has to establish what it was that\nwas said, but also has to construct, from an assortment of clues, the affect-\nive state of the speaker and a profile of his identity.\u2019 The last two phrases,\n\u2018the affective state of the speaker\u2019 and \u2018a profile of his identity,\u2019 are much the\nsame as what I have called \u2018face,\u2019 for they are concerned with what the\nspeaker is trying to communicate about himself or herself on a particular\noccasion. Laver and Trudgill add that, \u2018Fortunately, the listener\u2019s task is made\na little easier by the fact that the vocal clues marking the individual physical,\npsychological, and social characteristics of the speaker are numerous.\u2019 In other\nwords, there is likely to be a variety of linguistic clues to help the listener.\nObviously, listeners will vary in their ability to detect such clues, just as speakers\nwill vary in their ability to present or maintain faces. Consequently, we find here\none area of human activity in which there may be a wide range of human\nabilities so that, whereas X may be said to be \u2018sensitive\u2019 to others, Y may appear\n\u2018insincere,\u2019 and Z may be completely \u2018deviant,\u2019 and all because of the \u2018faces\u2019 they\npresent to the world and the amount of success they achieve in their chosen\nroles.\nConversation is cooperative in at least one further way. As we saw in chapter\n10, ethnomethodologists are concerned with how human beings interact with\nthe world around them in dealing with the mundane phenomena of humanexist-\nence. They insist that human beings make use of commonsense knowledge,\nwhich is different in kind from scientific knowledge, and that they employ prin-\nciples of practical reasoning, which are again somewhat different from scientific\nprinciples. Moreover, all humans share this orientation and thus cooperate to\ndeal with the world in much the same way. Consequently, we do not do certain\nkinds of things \u2013 insist on the literal interpretations of remarks, constantly ques-\ntion another\u2019s assumptions, refuse to take things for granted, attack received\nAITC12 294 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 295\nwisdom, require logical proofs in all reasoning, and so on. There is an unwritten\nagreement to deal with the world and matters in the world in certain ways; con-\nsequently, we put ourselves in serious peril of misunderstanding if we violatethat\nagreement. As we will see in the following section, there is also a considerable\nmeasure of agreement about how conversations are organized, and once more\nwe will see that we violate these principles of organization at our peril.\nDiscussion\n1. What might happen if you said to a friend, \u2018completely out of the blue,\u2019\neach of the following? Why?\na: Your husband\/wife is still faithful.\nb: The sun did rise this morning.\nc: Your shoes are clean today.\nd: I\u2019m the happiest person in the world.\ne: Tomorrow\u2019s [Friday].\nf: Love makes the world go round.\n2.

Part of a professional face is being able to handle the language and tools\nof a particular calling with assurance.

Face involves more than demeanor, i.e., how one appears. It involves what\nwe project about, and claim for, ourselves. How is each of the following\nfaces projected or claimed linguistically: anger, contentment, suffering,sorrow,\nexcitement, decisiveness, meekness, and contrition?\n6. Why is B\u2019s response odd in each case?\nA: I wonder what time the sun rises tomorrow.\nB: The sun doesn\u2019t rise; the earth rotates.\nA: Have a nice day.\nB: What\u2019s a nice day?\n7. The reaction of most people to finding out that a conversation they have\nhad with another has been recorded in some way is nearly always one of\nbetrayal or suspicion. How do you account for this reaction?\n8. In an article entitled \u2018Questions and Non-Answers\u2019, Pride (1986) points out\nnine different kinds of non-answers to questions: an outright lie; three kinds\nof refusal (unqualified, objection-raising, and remedied or mitigated); and\nfour kinds of evasion (not answering, implicit response, delayed response,\nand forestalling or heading-off). This schema takes into account the motive\nof the responder, i.e., the non-answerer. Try to use it to examine a variety\nof question-and-answer encounters.\nConversation\nSpeech can be planned or unplanned (Ochs, 1979). We should note that a lot\nof speech has a certain amount of planning in it: it may not be all thought out\nand carefully planned and even rehearsed, as, for example, is the welcoming\nspeech of a visiting head of state, but parts may be pre-planned to a greater or\nlesser extent. Unplanned speech is talk which is not thought out prior to its\nexpression. Unplanned speech has certain characteristics: repetitions; simple active\nsentences; speaker and listener combining to construct propositions; stringing of\nclauses together with and or but or the juxtapositioning of clauses with no overt\nlinks at all; deletion of subjects and referents; and use of deictics, e.g., wordssuch\nas this, that, here, and there. It may also be filled with equivocations (or hedges),\ni.e., words and expressions such as well, like, maybe, but, sort of, you know,\nI guess, etc. The syntax of unplanned conversation is also not at all that of\nformal, edited written prose. It is composed of utterances that are often frag-\nmented and overlapping. They are not the complete, non-overlapping sentences\nwhich we carefully organize into larger units like the paragraphs, sections, and\nchapters of a book such as this one. It is the rare person indeed who \u2018speaks\nin paragraphs.\u2019 Unplanned speech, however, is not unorganized speech. Unor-\nganized speech would be speech in which anything goes. We saw in the first part\nof this chapter a number of overriding constraints on what we say. We obviously\nAITC12 296 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 297\ncannot say anything to anyone at any time. Nor, as we will now see, can we say\nwhat we say in any way that we please. There are specific procedures we must\nfollow as we indulge in the give-and-take of conversation. We ignore or violate\nthese at our peril. A very simple illustration should suffice. You find yourself lost\nin a large city and need to seek help. Who do you approach, what do you say,\nand what limits are there to any subsequent verbal exchanges?\nAnalysts working in the ethnomethodological tradition described in theprevious\nchapter have paid close attention to conversation. They have examined howpeople\nmanage conversations, how talk proceeds in turns, how one utterance relates to\nanother often in some kind of pair relationship, how topics are introduced,\ndeveloped, and changed, and so on. Their concern is the very orderliness of talk;\nthey regard conversation as skilled work in which we necessarily participate.\nTheir goal is to explain that order and those skills. The data they use are \u2018closely\ntranscribed examples of actual talk recorded in naturally occurring settings\u2019\n(Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998, p. 5) \u2018...produced for the specific people present\nat the time, whether face to face or on the other end of a telephone line...[and]\nwhat we have to do is look to see how the recipient(s) of such utterances\ninterpreted them\u2019 (p. 16) \u2018...[because] talk-in-interaction can be treated as an\nobject of analysis in its own right, rather than simply as a window through\nwhich we can view other social processes or broader sociological variables\u2019\n(p. 21).\nWhen we look at how actual speech or conversation is organized, we begin\nto appreciate how complex it is as soon as we try to devise any kind of system\nfor talking about the various bits and pieces that occur and recur. If aconversation\nis \u2018interesting,\u2019 it is largely so because of the unpredictability of its content, so\nclassifying by content is likely to be an impossible task. However, finding the\norganizational principles used offers us some hope. Even the most unpredict-\nable of conversations is likely to make use of such principles; in fact, we might\nargue that something is a conversation not so much by reason of what was said\nbut by reason of how it was said, i.e., by the use of certain principles that we\nemploy time and time again to structure what we want to say. What speakers\nand listeners have is a set of such principles; what they do in a particular\nconversation is draw on that set. It is also sometimes said that conversations are\nlocally managed, i.e., they actually proceed without any conscious plan and the\nparticipants simply rely on using the principles that are available to them to\nachieve any wider objectives they have.\nOne particularly important principle used in conversation is the adjacency\npair. Utterance types of certain kinds are found to co-occur: a greeting leads to\na return of greeting; a summons leads to a response; a question leads to an\nanswer; a request or offer leads to an acceptance or refusal; a complaint leads\nto an apology or some kind of rejection; a statement leads to some kind of\nconfirmation or recognition; a compliment leads to acceptance or rejection; a\nfarewell leads to a farewell; and so on. This basic pairing relationship provides\nthe possibilities of both continuity and exchange in that it enables both parties\nto say something and for these somethings to be related. It also allows foroptions\nin the second member of each pair and for a kind of chaining effect. A ques-\ntion can lead to an answer, which can lead to a comment, which can lead to an\nAITC12 297 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 298 Talk and Action\nacknowledgment, and so on. The ring of a telephone (summons) can lead to a\nresponse (\u2018Hello\u2019) with the rising intonation of a question, which thus requires\nan answer, and so on. These are purely linear chains. But there can be othertypes\nof chain, as when a question\u2013answer or topic\u2013comment routine is included as\na sub-routine into some other pair.\nIt has proved possible to plot the structure of many conversations using these\nideas of pairing and chaining in order to show how dependent we are on them.\nWe can also show this same dependence by acknowledging what happens when\nthere are violations: not responding to a question; not offering a comment when\none is solicited; not acknowledging a request; not exchanging a greeting; and so\non. These violations tend to disrupt conversations or to require explanations.\nFor example, if your telephone keeps ringing when I dial your number, I will\ntend to assume that you are out rather than that my summons is being ignored.\nThere is actually some controversy over whether there is such a basic two-part\nexchange. Another view holds that a basic \u2018exchange\u2019 has three parts: \u2018initia-\ntion,\u2019 \u2018response,\u2019 and \u2018feedback.\u2019 In this view, unless some form of feedback\noccurs the total exchange is incomplete (see Stubbs, 1983). Tsui (1989) also\nargues for such a three-part exchange in which a following move of some kind\ncloses out the sequence: \u2018a potentially three-part exchange, which may contain\nnonverbal component parts, is more adequate than an adjacency pair as a basic\nunit of conversational organization\u2019 (p. 561).\nConversation is a cooperative activity also in the sense that it involves two\nor more parties, each of whom must be allowed the opportunity to participate.\nConsequently, there must be some principles which govern who gets to speak,\ni.e., principles of turn-taking. Turn-taking in conversation is much morecomplex\nthan it might appear because we engage in it so easily and skillfully. Utterances\nusually do not overlap other utterances, and the gaps between utterances are\nsometimes measurable in micro-seconds and on average are only a few tenths\nof a second. Turn-taking also applies in a variety of circumstances: between as\nfew as two participants and upward of a score; on the telephone as well as in\nface-to-face interaction; and regardless of the length of particular utterances or\nhow many people want to take a turn. It seems that there must be some system\nof \u2018traffic rules\u2019 which we are aware of since we manage the taking of turns so\nwell. It is very rare indeed to see turn-taking spelled out in advance, e.g., in\nceremonials or formal debates in which turns are pre-allocated. Ordinary con-\nversation employs no such pre-allocation: the participants just \u2018naturally\u2019 take\nturns. We will see, however, that we can offer some account of what actually\noccurs.\nIn most conversations \u2013 Schegloff (2000, pp. 47\u20138) admits that there may be\nexceptions \u2013 only one person speaks at a time and that person is recognized to\nbe the one whose turn it is to speak. At the conclusion of that turn another may\nspeak, and, as I have indicated, there may also be slight overlapping of speaking\nduring the transition between turns. The existence of adjacency pairing assures\nthat there will be turns; however, it does not assure that these turns will be of\nany particular length. Once a speaker gets a turn to speak, he or she may be\nreluctant to give up that turn and may employ any one or more of a variety of\ndevices to keep it: avoidance of eye contact with listeners; stringing utterances\nAITC12 298 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 299\ntogether in a seamless manner; avoiding the kinds of adjacency pairings that\nrequire others to speak; employing gestures and a posture that inhibit others\nfrom speaking; and so on. In these ways a speaker can exploit a turn, but such\nexploitation can be dangerous if carried to the extreme of \u2018hogging\u2019 the con-\nversation, turning it into a speech or a monolog, or just simply boring thelisteners\nby not allowing them the opportunity to participate or possibly even to escape.\nYou must be prepared to give others a turn if you expect to take a turn yourself.\nTurn-taking may actually vary by cultural group. Tannen (1987) identifies\na New York conversational style which she labels (p. 581) as \u2018conversational\noverlap.\u2019 She claims that New Yorkers like a lot of talk going on in casual\nconversation to the extent that they talk while others are talking. In a later book\n(1994) she calls this kind of simultaneous speech \u2018cooperative overlapping\u2019 (p.62).\nShe adds that it is \u2018supportive rather than obstructive, evidence not of domina-\ntion but of participation, not power, but the paradoxically related dimension,\nsolidarity.\u2019 It is speech motivated by high involvement rather than disruption.\nShe does admit, though, in the earlier discussion that those unfamiliar with this\nhabit may well consider themselves to be constantly interrupted or even talked\ninto silence, their turn-taking principles having been violated.\nThere are also certain linguistic and other signals that go with turn-taking.\nSpeakers may signal when they are about to give up a turn in any one of several\nways, or by some combination (Duncan, 1972, 1974). The final syllable or final\nstressed syllable of an utterance may be prolonged. The pitch level of the voice\nmay signal closure, for example, by dropping in level on the final syllable. An\nutterance may be deliberately closed syntactically to achieve a sense of complete-\nness. Words or expressions like \u2018you know\u2019 or \u2018something\u2019 can also be used to\nindicate a turn-point. Finally, the body itself, or part of it, may signal closure:\na relaxing of posture; a gesture with a hand; or directing one\u2019s gaze at the\nlistener. Such cues signal completion and allow the listener to take a turn. They\nsignal what has been called a \u2018transition relevant place.\u2019 We must be alert to\nsuch places if we want to take a turn. Of course, such places also offer the\nspeaker the opportunity to select the next speaker. When there are several lis-\nteners present, a speaker may attempt to address the cues to a specific listener\nso as to select that listener as next speaker. Speaking is not always a matter of\nself-selection; sometimes a specific person is clearly being called upon to speak,\neven on the most informal of occasions. A speaker\u2019s use of gaze, i.e., lookingat\na specific individual, or of a name (\u2018honey,\u2019 or \u2018John,\u2019 or \u2018coach\u2019) or even a plain\n\u2018you\u2019 may suffice, but such usage varies widely by group and situation (Lerner,\n2003). Sometimes, when there is no such selection, there is often an embarrass-\ning pause, and, since conversationalists (certainly English conversationalists!)\nabhor silence, someone will usually try to take up the turn as soon as possible.\nIf pairing and turn-taking are integral parts of all conversations, they are so\nby virtue of the fact that we can identify a certain kind of language activity as\nconversation and particular instances as specific conversations. Conversations\nmust also have ways of getting started, have some recognizable core or sub-\nstance to them, i.e., topic or topics, and be concludable. Each conversation must\nbe recognizable as an instance of the genre; however, what makes each recogniz-\nable is not its content but rather its form.\nAITC12 299 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 300 Talk and Action\nThe beginning of a conversation will generally involve an exchange ofgreetings\n(see Schegloff, 1986). A telephone conversation may involve an exchange of\n\u2018Hello\u2019s; a meeting between strangers might require an exchange of \u2018How do\nyou do\u2019s followed by some kind of self-identification; a meeting between very\nintimate acquaintances who spend much time together may have its own special\nritualistic beginning. Much of this preliminary part of a conversation is highly\nprescribed by cultural setting: how you answer the telephone varies from group\nto group; greeting exchanges involving the use of names or address terms vary\nenormously, as we saw in chapter 11; who speaks first, what a suitable reply is,\nand even what variety of language is employed may also be tightly constrained\nby circumstances.\nTo return briefly to the subject of answering the telephone, I can illustrate\na little of the variety we find. In Japan, it is the caller who speaks first on the\ntelephone, and, in doing so, identifies himself or herself. In the Netherlands and\nSweden (Lindstr\u00f6m, 1994) people usually answer the telephone by identifying\nthemselves. In France, a telephone call is an intrusion, so the caller feels some\nobligation to verify the number, identify himself, and be excused for intruding\n(Godard, 1977). We can see the process of verification at work when the caller\nsays such things as All\u00f4, c\u2019est toi Nicole?, All\u00f4, je suis bien chez M. Thibault?,\nor All\u00f4, la Mairie? and then proceeds to identify himself (Ici, Jacques), because,\naccording to one source (Vigner, 1978), the rule is Dire tr\u00e8s rapidement qui vous\n\u00eates et indiquer aussi la raison de votre appel (\u2018Say very quickly who you are\nand also state the reason for your call\u2019). In North America, telephone calls are\nnot regarded as intrusive to the same extent. They quite routinely interrupt\nother activities. People seem to find it difficult not to answer the telephone, and\napologies for calling are rarely offered or are not taken very seriously, except\nat strange hours, e.g., a wrong number dialed at 4 a.m. (For how Greeks have\ntaken to the telephone and integrated its use into their culture, see Sifianou,\n1989.) As telephone technology changes with the addition of screening systems\nand answering devices it will be interesting to see how calls are managed to\nreflect these new ways of answering the telephone. When you call someone you\nare choosing the time and topic and are exercising some degree of power. When\nyou return someone\u2019s call you are choosing the time if not the topic but you are\nnot unprepared. If you do not return the call you have exercised some power\nof your own, little though that may be. (See also Hopper, 1992, ch. 9.)\nOnce a conversation has been initiated and the opening forms have been\nexchanged, it will be necessary to establish a topic or topics on which to talk.\nOne party may have something he or she wishes to convey to, or discuss with,\nthe other. In a telephone conversation, for example, you assume that it is the\ncaller who has a definite topic in mind. If a telephone caller does not have a\nspecific topic in mind, he or she must quickly mention this fact in some way. If\nthe caller attempts to complete the call without either bringing up a topic or\nexplaining that it was a call without a pre-designated topic, the party called is\nlikely to feel somewhat bewildered.\nMost investigators are agreed that what actually constitutes a topic in a\nconversation is not at all clear. Brown and Yule (1983, pp. 89\u201390) discuss this\nissue as follows:\nAITC12 300 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 301\nit is a feature of a lot of conversation that \u2018topics\u2019 are not fixed beforehand, but\nare negotiated in the process of conversing. Throughout a conversation, the next\n\u2018topic\u2019 of conversation is developing. Each speaker contributes to the conversation\nin terms of both the existing topic framework and his or her personal topic. It is\nclear...that some elements in a speaker\u2019s personal topic do not become salient\nelements in the conversation if neither the other participant nor the speaker herself\nmentions them again....Characterising the individual speaker\u2019s topic as \u2018what I\nthink we\u2019re talking about\u2019 incorporates both that element which theconversational\nanalyst tends to abstract as the \u2018topic of conversation\u2019 for the participants (\u2018What\nwe\u2019re talking about\u2019) and the individual speaker\u2019s version (\u2018I think\u2019), as he\/she\nmakes a conversational contribution. That speakers do introduce what they want\nto say via some form of personal reference has a noticeable effect on the structure\nof contributions in conversational discourse....\nFrom what we have proposed as speakers\u2019 topics in conversational discourse, it\nmust occasionally happen that there are at least two versions of \u2018What I think\nwe\u2019re talking about\u2019 which are potentially incompatible. It is a noticeable feature\nof co-operative conversational discourse, however, that this potential incompatibil-\nity rarely leads to conflict over the topic of conversation. What typically happens\nis that, in the negotiation process, one speaker realises that his version is incom-\npatible with what the other appears to be talking about and makes his contribu-\ntions compatible with \u2018what I think you (not we) are talking about\u2019.\nIn one sense, then, the topic is obviously the thing that is talked about, but each\nof the talkers may have quite different views from the others concerning exactly\nwhat was talked about. Moreover, since parts of some conversations and some-\ntimes the whole of others may be mainly phatic in intent, what exactly was\ntalked about may be less important than the fact that talk itself occurred. It is\nalso often possible to give a better account of what topics were discussed after\na conversation than during it because topics work themselves out in the process\nof talking. It is very rare indeed, usually only on very special and, therefore,\nhighly marked occasions, that speakers and listeners work systematically through\na topic. What they are much more likely to do is talk topically, and in doing\nso exhibit a considerable degree of tolerance for unclarity, ambiguity, inexplicit-\nness, and even incoherence in the expectation that all, or at least those parts that\nare necessary for proper understanding, will eventually be revealed.\nSpeaking around and about a topic requires what has been called floor man-\nagement, i.e., ensuring that everyone gets to make the contribution he or she\nwishes to make. Speakers may overlap one another so that simultaneous talk\nwill occur, there will be back-channel cues given and taken (often verbal encour-\nagements), and almost certainly some synchronicity of movements and gestures.\nHayashi (1996) compared English and Japanese conversations using groups of\nuniversity students, four of which were English-speaking Americans and four\nJapanese-speaking Japanese, with each group divided equally by gender. She\nfound that whereas Japanese males held the floor to a greater extent than\nJapanese females, American males and females shared the floor equally. The\nJapanese showed a greater preference for back-channeling than did the Ameri-\ncans. The Japanese women were generally quiet listeners who tended to support\nmen rather than interact with them as equals. Itakura and Tsui (2004) used\nconversations produced by eight mixed-gender pairs of Japanese university\nAITC12 301 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 302 Talk and Action\nstudents to look at issues of turn-taking and dominance, i.e., who gets to control\nthe floor in conversation. They found that \u2018male speakers\u2019 self-oriented conver-\nsational style and female speakers\u2019 other-oriented conversational style are com-\nplementary and mutually reinforcing rather than competing. In other words,\nmale dominance is not something predetermined and imposed on female speak-\ners. It is instead mutually constructed by the two parties\u2019 (p. 244). While topic\nmanagement and floor management may employ the same devices everywhere,\nthey do not always produce the same results.\nSince topics in conversation are usually not well defined, they may be fairly\neasily changed. One topic exhausts itself so a new one is introduced. However,\nif most of the conversationalists are fully engaged with a topic and one person\ntries to force such a change before the point of exhaustion, that attempt is likely\nto be resisted. It may be successful only if the person trying to force the changehas\nsome special power in the group, that is, if he or she is a leader, boss, or teacher,\nfor example. A premature change in topic may be regarded as an interruption,\nand when the interruption is dealt with, as when the new topic is dropped or\nthe person with power moves away, the original topic may be resumed.Sometimes\na topic exhausts itself and there appears to be no new topic available to the\ngroup; in such circumstances silence is likely to result with some attempt made\nto fill it. If the attempt to fill the silence is unsuccessful, the group may disband.\nAlternatively, there may be competition among two or more new topics and\nspeakers, with some consequent overlap until one topic gets established and the\nother or others are dropped or shelved for a while. If all participants regard that\nnew topic as a suitable one, it will be developed; if not, they may drop it quite\nquickly, particularly if one of the shelved topics now appears to be more inter-\nesting, a fact which need not have been immediately obvious to the group.\nOnce a topic is established, speakers can keep it going by employing many\nof the same devices they use as individuals to keep their turns going. They can\nlink utterances together thematically, syntactically, or logically. A wide variety of\ndevices is available to achieve such continuity. In the case of an individual turn\nthese devices can prevent interruption in that they can be used to show that\nthe speaker is not finished and that the turn will not be completed until it is\nproperly marked as completed. So far as continuing a topic is concerned, the\nsame types of device serve to link utterance to utterance. One speaker can link\nremarks to another speaker\u2019s remarks, overlap another\u2019s remarks, or even delib-\nerately adopt or adapt the devices the other is employing. Feedback, an import-\nant element in warranting the continuation of a turn, can also lend approval to\nthe continuation of a topic. The nods of approval or other gestures of listeners,\n\u2018mhm\u2019s and \u2018yes\u2019s, and other empathetic signals indicate to a speaker that the\nfloor is still his or hers and the topic is of interest. When such feedback (or back-\nchanneling) ceases, both turn and topic are put at risk. (See Schiffrin, 1987, for\na general discussion of \u2018discourse markers.\u2019)\nSpeakers are sometimes interrupted or even interrupt themselves. A skillful\nspeaker may try to lessen the chances of the first kind of interruption by struc-\nturing his or her remarks in such a way as to lessen the possibilities of inter-\nruption, controlling the amount and kind of gaze used between self and others,\nand ensuring that the kinds of signals that tend to indicate that a turn is being\nAITC12 302 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 303\nrelinquished are not allowed to occur by accident. But interruptions may still\noccur: there may be a knock at the door, the telephone may ring, someone may\nknock over a glass, and so on. What sometimes occurs then is a kind ofinsertion\nsequence (Schegloff, 1968), a piece of conversational activity with its own struc-\nture but a piece completely unrelated to the ongoing conversation and inserted\nwithin it. The word inserted is used because in most such instances the original\nconversation tends to be resumed where it broke off, sometimes without indica-\ntion that anything at all has happened, particularly if it is some kind of ritual\nthat is involved, or with the most minor kind of acknowledgment: \u2018Now where\nwere we? Oh, yes.\u2019 Here is an example of such an insertion:\nA: ...and as I was saying (telephone rings) Mary, get the phone.\nC: Okay.\nA: ...as I was saying, it should be next week.\nB: I see.\nOn the other hand, a side sequence (Jefferson, 1972) serves as a kind of\nclarification:\nA: You\u2019ll go then?\nB: I don\u2019t have to wear a tie?\nA: No!\nB: Okay, then.\nThe above BA sequence is a side sequence within the initial-final AB sequence\nof \u2018You\u2019ll go then?\u2019 and \u2018Okay, then.\u2019 Wootton (1975, p. 70) gives the following\ninteresting example of such a sequence used in a conversation between a patient\nand a therapist:\nPatient: I\u2019m a nurse, but my husband won\u2019t let me work.\nTherapist: How old are you?\nPatient: Thirty-one this December.\nTherapist: What do you mean, he won\u2019t let you work?\nIn this case we can see that the therapist\u2019s question about the patient\u2019s age is\ndirected toward clarifying the patient\u2019s claim that her husband will not let her\nwork. Apparently, the therapist considers that at 31 years of age the patient\nshould realize that she can exercise more control over her life than she seems\nprepared to exercise.\nSometimes side sequences act as repairs. Repairs are corrections of some kind\nof \u2018trouble\u2019 that arises during the course of conversation, that trouble coming\nfrom any one of a variety of factors. \u2018Excuse me\u2019 is sometimes interjected by a\nlistener into a speaker\u2019s words in an attempt to seek some kind of clarification:\nthis is other-initiated repair. Self-repair occurs when the speaker seeks to clarify\nin some way what is being said and not being understood. Egbert (1996) reports\non an interesting example of other-directed repair, the use of bitte \u2018pardon\u2019 in\nGerman. Bitte initiates repair but only when there is no mutual gaze between\nAITC12 303 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 304 Talk and Action\nthe parties. This use of bitte carries over to the telephone where there can be\nno such mutual gaze. Egbert points out (p. 608) that this use of \u2018bitte indexes\nthe fact that no mutual gaze is established during the delivery of the trouble-\nsource turn,\u2019 i.e., the place in the conversation where there is some breakdown\nin communication.\nConversations must also be brought to a close (see Aston, 1995). Quite often\nthe close itself is ritualistic, e.g., an exchange of \u2018Goodbye\u2019s. But such rituals\ndo not come unannounced: they are often preceded by clear indications that\nclosings are about to occur. All topics have been exhausted and nothing more\nremains to be said, but it is not quite the time to exchange farewells. It is into\nsuch places that you fit pre-closing signals which serve to negotiate the actual\nclosing. Such signals can involve an expression like \u2018Well, I think that\u2019s all,\u2019 or\na brief, deliberate summary of some earlier agreement, or a personal exchange\nlike \u2018Give my regards to your wife,\u2019 or they may take the form of a gesture or\na physical movement such as rising from a chair or adjusting your posture in\nsome way. Such signals indicate that the conversation is being closed with final\nclosure waiting only for a ritual exchange. Once conversationalists arrive at the\npre-closing stage, specific acknowledgment of that fact must be made ifsomehow\nthe conversation does not actually proceed to close: \u2018Oh, by the way; I\u2019ve just\nremembered,\u2019 or \u2018Something else has just occurred to me.\u2019\nAn actual closing may involve several steps: the closing down of a topic,\ne.g., \u2018So that\u2019s agreed\u2019 or \u2018One o\u2019clock, then\u2019 repeated by the other party or ac-\nknowledged in some form; then possibly some kind of pre-closing exchange,e.g.,\n\u2018Okay-Okay\u2019; a possible further acknowledgment of the nature of the exchange,\ne.g., \u2018Good to see you,\u2019 \u2018Thanks again,\u2019 or \u2018See you soon\u2019; and finally anexchange\nof farewells, e.g., \u2018Bye-Bye.\u2019 The following is an example of such a closing:\nA: So, that\u2019s agreed?\nB: Yep, agreed.\nA: Good, I knew you would.\nB: Yes, no problem really.\nA: Thanks for the help.\nB: Don\u2019t mention it.\nA: Okay, I\u2019ll be back soon.\nB: Okay, then, Bye. Take care.\nA: Bye.\nPre-closing signals may indeed be regarded as a sub-variety of mitigating\nexpressions used in conversation. Such expressions serve the twofold function of\nkeeping conversation going in a systematic manner and doing so while allowingthe\nconversationalists to preserve either the reality or the appearance ofcooperation.\nFor example, a pre-request to a secretary might take the following form:\nA: Are you doing anything important right now?\nB: No, not really.\nA: Okay, then, can you do this letter for me? I need it in a hurry.\nAITC12 304 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 305\nConsequently, we ask if we can make a request; or we negotiate a closing; orwe\nquestion someone\u2019s veracity, but, in doing so, we carefully tone down ourdoubts\nabout the truthfulness of what we are being told. We observe the decencies of\nlinguistic behavior, choosing our words to match the circumstances. Those cir-\ncumstances tell us that a particular conversation is but one in a long stream of\nconversations that will fill our lives. If we want to keep that stream flowing, and\nmost of us do, we have to work with others and constantly address issues of\nface and politeness.\nBoxer (2002, p. 51) provides a very short conversation that illustrates many\nof the points just made. Two female students pass each other on campus on the\nway to class:\nA: Hey, how are you doing?\nB: Fine, how about you? Going to class?\nA: Calculus, I hate it! (keeps moving)\nB: Ugh! Well, catch you later.\nA: Yeah, see you at the meeting.\nHere we have various pairings, including a greeting and a farewell, and a topic\nbriefly raised and dealt with, and all this done in a mutually supportive way. As\nBoxer says, this \u2018sequence, despite being on the run, does important interactional\nwork for these interlocutors\u2019 (p. 52).\nThe characteristics I have just discussed are some of the more interesting ones\nthat have been observed in ordinary everyday conversation. Almost any conver-\nsation will provide examples of some of them, and any long conversation will\nprobably provide instances of just about all. What will be remarkable is that\nnone of the conversations will strike you as being unusual in any respect, but\nwithout the kinds of organizing principles I have described they would not exist\nat all. Strange or unusual conversations may be so described because of the way\nin which they violate, fail to employ, or exploit one or more of the principles\nmentioned above. For example, a monolog does not allow for turn-taking;talk-\ning to oneself involves turn-taking without the usual accompanying exchange of\nspeaker and listener; and an aside in a speech within a play is a particular kind\nof side-sequence employed as a stage convention.\nHowever, there are conversational settings that are unusual in still other ways.\nBecause of the way in which certain of the principles are used, particular typesof\nconversation may be given quite specific names: for example, teaching,interview-\ning, or interrogating. That is, in certain circumstances some of the principles we\ncustomarily use in conversation are not used at all, or are used in special ways,\nor are used in an \u2018abnormal\u2019 manner.\nThe use of language in the classroom by teachers and students provides agood\nexample. Most teaching involves a lot of talk, but classroom talk is dominated\nby the teacher, who selects topics, sees that participants stick to the chosentopics,\nand decides how these will be discussed and who will be allowed, evennominated,\nto discuss them. The teacher has special rights and also has the power to control\nmuch of what happens in the classroom. As Coulthard (1977, p. 101) says,\nAITC12 305 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 306 Talk and Action\nVerbal interaction inside the classroom differs markedly from desultory conversa-\ntion in that its main purpose is to instruct and inform, and this difference is\nreflected in the structure of the discourse. In conversation, topic changes are un-\npredictable and uncontrollable, for...a speaker can even talk \u2018on topic\u2019 without\ntalking on the topic intended by the previous speaker. Inside the classroom it is one\nof the functions of the teacher to choose the topic, decide how it will be subdivided\ninto smaller units, and cope with digressions and misunderstandings.\nMoreover, the teacher gets to ask most of the questions, and, on the whole,\nthese questions are of a very special kind: they are usually questions to which\nthe teacher already has the answer. The questions are quite often addressed to\na whole group of listeners and individuals in that group are required to bid for\nthe right to answer. Furthermore, when someone is chosen to answer thequestion,\nthe whole answering ritual is gone through for the benefit of all participants, not\njust for the benefit of the one who asked the question. Finally, the questioner\nactually evaluates the answer as one which is not only right in providing the\ninformation that was sought but also right in relation to how the teacher is seek-\ning to develop the topic. The conversation can also be made topical, asresponses\ncan be judged for their quality, quantity, and appropriateness (or lack of it).\nClassroom conversational activity is very highly marked, for any of the above\nactivities carried over to ordinary everyday conversation would result in strong\nobjections by \u2018innocent\u2019 parties in such conversation: they would feel that they\nwere being manipulated.\nClassroom conversation is different from ordinary conversation in the sense\nthat the teacher may be said to \u2018own\u2019 the conversation, whereas in ordinary\nconversations such ownership may be said to be shared. You own aconversation\nwhen you control such matters as topic selection, turn-taking, and evenbeginnings\nand endings. In such circumstances there is also a reduction of localmanagement,\nthat is, the need to work things out in conversation as you proceed. Classroom\nconversations have officially appointed managers, just like coronations, parlia-\nmentary debates, religious services, court hearings, and so on.\nTeachers actually get to comment on the contributions of others with theintent\nof making such contributions fit a predetermined pattern. We can try to imagine\nwhat would happen if we attempted to manage an ordinary conversation insuch\na manner: if we insisted on selecting topics and saw that others keep to them\nand to our definitions of them; decided who was to speak and for how long, and\ninterrupted as we felt the urge; began or ended the talk to meet our own goals\nor external demands, such as bells and recesses; and told X that what he said\nwas irrelevant, Y that what she said was just repeating W, and asked Z to\nsummarize what A and B said, and then expressed our approval (or disapproval)\nof the result. Children must learn about such ownership, and that learning may\nnot be at all easy.\nDoctor\u2013patient or lawyer\u2013client interviewing is also full of questioning behavior,\nbut in this case the questions are asked for the purposes of double-checking and\neliciting anything that might be relevant to deciding on a particular course ofac-\ntion. Such questioning may also be used for the purpose of classification: thename\nof a disease given to symptoms that have been elicited; a course of therapyindicated\nas a result of psychiatric assessment; or a particular plea to be made or position\nAITC12 306 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 307\nto be adopted by a client in a legal case. In each case the conversation is directed\ntoward establishing relevant \u2018facts\u2019 at a level of certainty that one would never\ntolerate in ordinary discussion of what happened or is happening. The extreme\nof this behavior is the investigative or interrogative process which a person in\ncustody or a witness in the witness box sometimes undergoes, with its goal the\nestablishing of what happened, \u2018the truth,\u2019 \u2018guilt,\u2019 or \u2018innocence.\u2019 Special rulesoften\nexist to control just what kinds of question can be asked in such circumstances.\nIn these various circumstances there is an important evaluative component:\nthe question and answering is conducted so that someone, not always the ques-\ntioner, can make a judgment of some kind. Ordinary conversation too involves\nevaluation, but not at the same level of intensity. A \u2018good\u2019 patient, witness, or\neven candidate being interviewed for a job realizes how important such evalu-\nation is and acts accordingly, tailoring responses to fit this known requirement\nand, in that respect, reacting differently than he or she would toward similar\nquestions asked in less marked circumstances. To fail to do so in certain circum-\nstances, as when you have sworn in court to tell the truth, may lead to a charge\nof perjury. Likewise, in an interview for a job, a refusal to play along to some\nextent with the conventions of interviewing may lead to a failure to acquire the\ndesired position. We should also be aware that not everyone possesses the same\nknowledge of the conventions that apply in such circumstances.\nOne consequence is that verbal exchanges which involve people from different\ncultural backgrounds can more easily go wrong than those that involve people\nwho share the same cultural background (Gumperz and Cook-Gumperz, 1982,\np. 14):\nMany of the meanings and understandings, at the level of ongoing processes of\ninterpretation of speaker\u2019s intent, depend upon culturally specific conventions, so\nthat much of the meaning in any encounter is indirect and implicit. The ability to\nexpose enough of the implicit meaning to make for a satisfactory encounter be-\ntween strangers or culturally different speakers requires communicative flexibility.\nNot everyone has such communicative flexibility, this ability to cross cultural\nboundaries. Consequently, when the cross-cultural exchange involves someimport-\nant matter, e.g., a trial, an interview for a position, or a disagreement between\nemployer and employee, there can be a serious breakdown in communication\nfrom the lack of such flexibility, as one party finds the other to be \u2018evasive,\u2019\n\u2018confrontational,\u2019 \u2018irrelevant,\u2019 \u2018angry,\u2019 \u2018aloof,\u2019 or \u2018indifferent.\u2019 We tend to rely\nvery heavily on our own cultural background in interpreting the talk of others,\nand it may not be at all easy to understand how this can create difficulties when\nthe others are either complete strangers or come from quite different cultural\nbackgrounds.\nAs Fairclough (1989) points out, many such situations are also asymmetric\ninsofar as power is concerned. When the parties to an exchangehave both\ndifferent norms of behavior and claims to power, their intentions toward each\nother must be our concern. Farf\u00e1n (2003) recounts a very good example of such\ninequalities in power between a Mestizo professional middleman buyer and a\npoor female H\u00f1ah\u00f1u occasional seller in a marketplace in Mexico. The buyer\nhas better control of Spanish and the money that she needs for goat skins she\nAITC12 307 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 308 Talk and Action\nmust sell to survive. The convention is that they should bargain to reach a fair\nprice for the skins because they are \u2018equal\u2019 parties. However, in addition to\nthe inequalities in language, gender, and power, there is consistent violation of\nthe linguistic conventions of buying and selling. The buyer takes control of the\nopening exchange, manipulates the turn-taking, cuts short the seller\u2019s responses,\nand, in fact, produces what might better be described as a monolog. For the\nbuyer this strategy maximizes his profits; for the seller it provides further con-\nfirmation of her oppression. The language use testifies to the fundamental social\nasymmetry that exists. In the chapters that follow we will look further at certain\nother possible asymmetries in the distribution of power, and at the views of\nFairclough and others like him that sociolinguists should do more than just\nreport on the imbalances they find: they should seek to reduce them.\nDiscussion\n1. Gumperz (1982a, p. 1) cites the following conversation recorded in a small\noffice:\nA: Are you gonna be here for ten minutes?\nB: Go ahead and take your break. Take longer if you want to.\nA: I\u2019ll just be outside on the porch. Call me if you need me.\nB: OK, don\u2019t worry.\nWhat can you say about the people, the situation, and their relationship\nfrom this brief exchange? (Gumperz discusses the conversation after he\ncites it.) Examine the following conversation in the same way (Levinson,\n1983, p. 48):\nA: So can you please come over here right now.\nB: Well, I have to go to Edinburgh today sir.\nA: Hmm. How about this Thursday?\n(Levinson also discusses what one might reasonably say about it.)\n2. Here are three more conversations with a few details you might need for\ninterpretation (Wardhaugh, 1985). Try to explain how each remark in the\nconversation relates to what has gone before and what follows.\na. This is a simple home-coming routine. Speaker B is in the house as\nSpeaker A enters and takes off his coat. Charlie is a cat.\nA: (Loudly) Hi, Sue!\nB: (Loudly) Hi, John!\nA: (Quietly) Hi, Charlie! Had your dinner?\nB: (Quite loudly) I\u2019ve fed the animals already.\nA: (Walks to kitchen) Been home long?\nAITC12 308 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 309\nB: Just a few minutes. I was out in a school all afternoon.\nA: Ah. We eating at home?\nB: Could I suppose.\nA: No. Let\u2019s go out. I\u2019ve got to look for a book.\nB: OK. Give me a few minutes to get changed. By the way...\nA: Yes?\nB: Oh, nothing. Chinese food?\nA: Yeah. If you want. I\u2019ll take the dog out for a walk while you\nget ready. (Loudly) Rufus!\nb. In this conversation the setting is a neighborhood convenience store\nand the time 11 p.m. Speaker A is a woman in one of the two lines\nto the cash registers. These lines are quite closely packed because there\nis not much space in the area in front of the registers. Speaker B, a\nman, is directly behind A in the same line. He is looking around at\nshelves and others in the store but is paying no particular attention to\nthe woman in front of him \u2013 she is just one of those \u2018others.\u2019\nA: (Looks directly at B) Would you like to get in front of me?\nB: (Surprised) No!\nA: You know I can feel your tension.\nB: (Edges back) I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not aware of it. (Turns away,\nraises his eyebrows, and shrugs his shoulders, directing these\nlast two actions toward the next one in line, C, who has over-\nheard the brief exchange.)\nC: (Similar shrugging behavior)\nc. This conversation involves an encounter between complete strangers.The\nsetting is a park adjacent to a university, one frequented by students\nand also by the general public. It is small, tree-filled, and pleasant.\nThe time is a fine autumn afternoon and the park is well populated.\nSpeaker B is sitting on a park bench. She is dressed in the style favored\nby students. There is an open book on her lap and some books on the\nbench beside her. Speaker A approaches her. He is a young man dressed\nin jeans and a black leather jacket, not a style of dress favored by\nstudents. As A approaches B, he speaks.\nA: You look a little lonely.\nB: Not at all.\nA: You smoke hash?\nB: I don\u2019t want to buy any, and I don\u2019t have any to sell.\nA: How about coke?\nB: Look! I\u2019m not bothering anyone and I was quite contentuntil...\nA: Two\u2019s company.\nB: You\u2019re a crowd.\nA: Don\u2019t get fresh with me.\nB: (Stands up, picks up books, leaves)\nAITC12 309 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM 310 Talk and Action\n3. Here are some conversational openers. When might each be suitable?\na: What time is it, please?\nb: Gotta match?\nc: Do you have the time?\nd: The bus is sure late!\ne: What a mess!\nf: Can I help you?\ng: Did you see that?\nh: Sorry!\ni: You seem lonely.\nj: Are you looking for Mr Jones?\nWhich of the above would be improved by an introductory \u2018Excuse me\u2019?\n4. Account for the \u2018Oh!\u2019 in the following conversation:\nA: Hello, John, how are you today?\nB: Awful. I\u2019ve got a horrible cold, my dog\u2019s sick, and work\u2019s just piling\nup all around me.\nA: Oh!\n5. You are at a party and you approach a group of strangers, one of whom\nsays \u2018Hello, we were just talking about the news from the Middle East.\u2019\nWhat do you consider to be the purpose of such a remark?\n6. What is the function of \u2018Yes\u2019 in the following two exchanges?\nTeacher: So which is the dependent variable?\nStudent: Age.\nTeacher: Yes.\nPhysician: How often do you get this itching?\nPatient: Often, just about every night.\nPhysician: Yes.\nWould you expect the two utterances of \u2018Yes\u2019 to be alike in loudness and\npitch? Who would speak next? What might be said?\n7. Try to formulate what you consider to be the characteristics of a \u2018good\u2019\nconversationalist and of a \u2018poor\u2019 conversationalist. Be as specific as you\ncan in trying to assess such matters as fluency, style of speech adopted,\nspecial mannerisms, types of expressions used, and so on.\n8. People seem to be reluctant to leave messages on answering machines. Can\nyou think of any reasons why this should be so? What kinds of instruc-\ntions to potential answerers seem to help?\n9. Edwards (1981, p. 303) contrasts \u2018relatively \u201copen\u201d\u2019 and \u2018\u201ctypical\u201d class-\nrooms\u2019 as follows:\nIn relatively \u2018open\u2019 classrooms, the greater range of semantic options avail-\nable to pupils may be evident in more overlapping talk, more pupil-selected\nAITC12 310 5\/9\/05, 4:30 PM Talk and Action 311\nnext speakers, more self-selected next speakers, more interruptions by pupils,\nfewer pauses, fewer invited stories and fewer but more tentative and more\nwidely distributed formulations. In short, more of the speech exchange sys-\ntem will be locally managed, and pupils too will be able to direct speakership\nin a creative way....In \u2018typical\u2019 classrooms, the point of persistent reference\nis the authority of the teacher as expert, which provides a more or less\ncontinuous interpretive context. A basic presupposition of teacher know-\nledge and pupil ignorance is a main resource from which both teacher and\npupils accomplish mutually comprehensible talk. Where the teacher\u2019s author-\nity has been partly relinquished or eroded, then the resulting interplay of\nalternative frames of reference and relevance will be evident in the discourse.\nRecord some examples of student\u2013teacher linguistic interaction in a class-\nroom (or classrooms) with which you are familiar and use them to justify\na claim that they reveal an \u2018open\u2019 situation rather than a \u2018typical\u2019 one, or\nvice versa.\n10. \u2018You know\u2019 and \u2018like\u2019 are two expressions (hedges) that often peppercertain\nconversations; they seem to be spread all over. Try to figure out some of\nthe uses of either (or both). (See Dailey-O\u2019Cain, 2000, for \u2018like.\u2019)\n11. Much of the humor in movies featuring the Marx Brothers comes from\ntheir crazy conversations as they violate many of the principles discussed\nin this chapter. Find some examples and try to explain what is going on.\nFurther Reading\nThe best general book on topics in this chapter is Schiffrin (1994).

Do the men and women\nwho speak a particular language use it in different ways? If they do, do these\ndifferences arise from the structure of that language, which would therefore be\none kind of confirmation of the Whorfian hypothesis (chapter 9), or, alternat-\nively, do any differences that exist simply reflect the ways in which the sexes\nrelate to each other in that society, whatever the reason? May it be possible to\ndescribe a particular language as \u2018sexist,\u2019 or should we reserve such a description\nfor those who use that language? If the answer to either question is affirmative,\nwhat could and should be done?\nThese issues generated a considerable amount of thought and discussion in\nthe last decades of the twentieth century and many are still unresolved. They\nare also very emotional issues for many who have chosen either to write on\nthem or to discuss them, and that they should be so is quite understandable. The\nliterature on these issues is now vast; it has been one of the biggest \u2018growth\u2019\nareas within sociolinguistics in recent years. In this chapter I will attempt to see\nwhat some of the underlying facts are and to avoid the kinds of rhetoric and\ndialectic that characterize much of the discussion of \u2018sexism in language,\u2019 a topic\nwhich often seems to invite \u2018large\u2019 arguments based on \u2018small\u2019 data.\nI should note too that in certain earlier editions of this book I entitled this\nchapter \u2018Language and Sex\u2019 rather than \u2018Language and Gender\u2019 or just simply\n\u2018Gender,\u2019 the current title. I said then that I preferred not to use the word gender\nbecause it was a technical term in linguistics (see Corbett, 1991) and many of\nthe issues dealt with in the chapter focused on claims about \u2018sexism.\u2019 I think that\nstatement is still true. However, the current vogue is to use gender rather than\nsex as the cover word for the various topics discussed in this chapter and I have\ntherefore adopted it here. Sex is to a very large extent biologically determined\nwhereas gender is a social construct (but still one heavily grounded in sex, as\nwe can see in recent publications that use the term \u2018sexuality,\u2019 e.g., Kulick, 2003,\nand Cameron and Kulick, 2003) involving the whole gamut of genetic, psycho-\nlogical, social, and cultural differences between males and females. Wodak (1997b,\np. 13) says that gender is \u2018not...a pool of attributes \u201cpossessed\u201d by a person,\nbut...something a person \u201cdoes.\u201d\u2019 Elsewhere (1997a, p. 4) she adds that\u2018what\nit means to be a woman or to be a man [also] changes from one generation to\nAITC13 315 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 316 Gender\nthe next and...varies between different racialized, ethnic, and religious groups,\nas well as for members of different social classes.\u2019 In such a view, gender must\nbe learned anew in each generation. Cameron (1998b, pp. 280\u20131) states that\nview in a slightly different way:\nMen and women...are members of cultures in which a large amount of discourse\nabout gender is constantly circulating. They do not only learn, and then mechanic-\nally reproduce, ways of speaking \u2018appropriate\u2019 to their own sex; they learn a much\nbroader set of gendered meanings that attach in rather complex ways to different\nways of speaking, and they produce their own behavior in the light of these\nmeanings....\nPerforming masculinity or femininity \u2018appropriately\u2019 cannot mean giving exactly\nthe same performance regardless of the circumstances. It may involve different\nstrategies in mixed and single-sexed company, in private and public settings, in the\nvarious social positions (parent, lover, professional, friend) that someone might\nregularly occupy in the course of everyday life.\nGender is also something we cannot avoid; it is part of the way in which\nsocieties are ordered around us, with each society doing that ordering differ-\nently. As Eckert and McConnell-Ginet (2003, p. 50) say: \u2018The force of gender\ncategories in society makes it impossible for us to move through our lives in a\nnongendered way and impossible not to behave in a way that brings out gendered\nbehavior in others.\u2019 Gender is a key component of identity.\nWe will look at some of the evidence that there are gender differences in\nlanguage use. One purpose will be to evaluate that evidence: just how good is\nit? However, the main purpose is to try to discover, when indeed there is good\nevidence, what it is good evidence of. That languages can be sexist? That those\nwho use languages may be sexist? That language-learning is almost inevitably\ntied to gender-learning? That such learning is almost always skewed in such a\nway as to favor one gender over the other? That change is not only desirable\nbut possible? It is issues such as these that will be our concern.\nDifferences\nThat there are differences between men and women is hardly a matter of dis-\npute. Females have two X chromosomes whereas males have an X and a Y; this\nis a key genetic difference and no geneticist regards that difference as unim-\nportant. On average, females have more fat and less muscle than males, are not\nas strong, and weigh less. They also mature more rapidly and live longer. The\nfemale voice usually has different characteristics from the male voice, and often\nfemales and males exhibit different ranges of verbal skills. However, we also\nknow that many of the differences may result from different socialization prac-\ntices (see Philips et al., 1987). For example, women may live longer than men\nbecause of the different roles they play in society and the different jobs they tend\nto fill. Differences in voice quality may be accentuated by beliefs about what\nAITC13 316 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 317\nmen and women should sound like when they talk, and any differences in verbal\nskills may be explained in great part through differences in upbringing. (It has\noften been noted that there is far more reading failure in schools among boys\nthan girls, but it does not follow from this fact that boys are inherently less well\nequipped to learn to read, for their poor performance in comparison to girls\nmay be sociocultural in origin rather than genetic.) There is also an important\ncaveat concerning all such studies showing differences between groups, and the\ntwo genders are just groups like any other; it is one I made earlier (p. 158) and\nwill repeat here. For many in the two groups under comparison there will beno\ndifference at all: the next person you meet on the street may be male or female,\ntall or short, long-lived or short-lived, high-voiced or low-voiced, and so on,\nwith not one of these characteristics being predictable from any other. (Given a\nthousand or more such encounters some tendencies may emerge, but even knowing\nwhat these are would not help you with the very next person you meet.)\nNumerous observers have described women\u2019s speech as being different from\nthat of men (see Baron, 1986, Arliss, 1991, pp. 44\u2013112, and pp. 162\u2013207 of\nthis book). I should also observe that there is a bias here: men\u2019s speech usually\nprovides the norm against which women\u2019s speech is judged. We could just as\nwell ask how men\u2019s speech differs from that of women, but investigators havenot\nusually gone about the task of looking at differences in that way. For example,\nin discussing language change in Philadelphia, Labov (2001, pp. 281\u20132) delib-\nerately recasts his statement that \u2018Women conform more closely than men to\nsociolinguistic norms that are overtly prescribed, but conform less than men\nwhen they are not\u2019 to read that men \u2018are less conforming than women with\nstable linguistic variables, and more conforming when change is in progress\nwithin a linguistic system.\u2019 He does this so as to avoid appearing to bias his\nfindings.\nAny view too that women\u2019s speech is trivial (see the denial in Kipers, 1987),\ngossip-laden, corrupt, illogical, idle, euphemistic, or deficient is highly suspect;\nnor is it necessarily more precise, cultivated, or stylish \u2013 or even less profane (see\nDe Klerk, 1992, and Hughes, 1992) \u2013 than men\u2019s speech. Such judgments lack\nsolid evidentiary support. For example, apparently men \u2018gossip\u2019 just as much as\nwomen do (see Pilkington, 1998); men\u2019s gossip is just different. Men indulge in\na kind of phatic small talk that involves insults, challenges, and various kinds\nof negative behavior to do exactly what women do by their use of nurturing,\npolite, feedback-laden, cooperative talk. In doing this, they achieve the kind of\nsolidarity they prize. It is the norms of behavior that are different.\nIn the linguistic literature perhaps the most famous example of gender differ-\nentiation is found in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies among the Carib\nIndians. Male and female Caribs have been reported to speak different lan-\nguages, the result of a long-ago conquest in which a group of invading Carib-\nspeaking men killed the local Arawak-speaking men and mated with the Arawak\nwomen. The descendants of these Carib-speaking men and Arawak-speaking\nwomen have sometimes been described as having different languages for men\nand women because boys learn Carib from their fathers and girls learn Arawak\nfrom their mothers. This claim of two separate languages is now discounted.\nWhat differences there are actually do not result in two separate or different\nAITC13 317 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 318 Gender\nlanguages, but rather one language with noticeable gender-based characteristics\n(Baron, 1986, pp. 59\u201363, and Taylor, 1951b).\nPhonological differences between the speech of men and women have been\nnoted in a variety of languages. In Gros Ventre, an Amerindian language of the\nnortheast United States, women have palatalized velar stops where men have\npalatalized dental stops, e.g., female kjatsa \u2018bread\u2019 and male djatsa. When afemale\nspeaker of Gros Ventre quotes a male, she attributes female pronunciations to\nhim, and when a male quotes a female, he attributes male pronunciations to her.\nMoreover, any use of female pronunciations by males is likely to be regarded as\na sign of effeminacy. In a northeast Asian language, Yukaghir, both women and\nchildren have \/ts\/ and \/dz\/ where men have \/tj\/ and \/dj\/. Old people of bothgenders\nhave a corresponding \/7j\/ and \/jj\/. Therefore, the difference is not only gender-\nrelated, but also age-graded. Consequently, in his lifetime a male goes through\nthe progression of \/ts\/, \/tj\/, and \/7j\/, and \/dz\/, \/dj\/, and \/jj\/, and a female has a\ncorresponding \/ts\/ and \/7j\/, and \/dz\/ and \/jj\/. In Bengali men often substitute\n\/l\/ for initial \/n\/; women, children, and the uneducated do not do this. Likewise,\nin a Siberian language, Chukchi, men, but not women, often drop \/n\/ and \/t\/\nwhen they occur between vowels, e.g., female nitvaqenat and male nitvaqaat. In\nMontreal many more men than women do not pronounce the l in the pronouns\nil and elle. Schoolgirls in Scotland apparently pronounce the t in words like\nwater and got more often than schoolboys, who prefer to substitute a glottal\nstop. Haas (1944) observed that in Koasati, an Amerindian language spoken\nin southwestern Louisiana, among other gender-linked differences, men often\npronounced an s at the end of verbs but women did not, e.g., male lak\u00e1ws\n\u2018he is lifting it\u2019 and female lak\u00e1w. What was interesting was that this kind of\npronunciation appeared to be dying out, because younger women and girls\ndo not use these forms. That older speakers recognized the distinction as\ngender-based is apparent from the fact that women teach their sons to use the\nmale forms and men narrating stories in which women speak employ female\nforms in reporting their words. This practice is in direct contrast to the\naforementioned situation in Gros Ventre, where there is no such changeover in\nreporting or quoting.\nThere is also a very interesting example from English of a woman being\nadvised to speak more like a man in order to fill a position previously filled only\nby men. Margaret Thatcher was told that her voice did not match her position\nas British Prime Minister: she sounded too \u2018shrill.\u2019 She was advised to lower the\npitch of her voice, diminish its range, and speak more slowly, and thereby adopt\nan authoritative, almost monotonous delivery to make herself heard. She was\nsuccessful to the extent that her new speaking style became a kind of trademark,\none either well-liked by her admirers or detested by her opponents.\nIn the area of morphology and vocabulary, many of the studies have focused\non English. In a paper which, although it is largely intuitive, anecdotal, and\npersonal in nature, is nevertheless challenging and interesting, Lakoff (1973),\nclaims that women use color words like mauve, beige, aquamarine, lavender,\nand magenta but most men do not. She also maintains that adjectives such as\nadorable, charming, divine, lovely, and sweet are also commonly used by women\nbut only very rarely by men. Women are also said to have their own vocabulary\nAITC13 318 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 319\nfor emphasizing certain effects on them, words and expressions such as so good,\nsuch fun, exquisite, lovely, divine, precious, adorable, darling, and fantastic.\nFurthermore, the English language makes certain distinctions of a gender-based\nkind, e.g., actor\u2013actress, waiter\u2013waitress, and master\u2013mistress. Some of these\ndistinctions are reinforced by entrenched patterns of usage and semantic devel-\nopment. For example, master and mistress have developed quite different rangesof\nuse and meaning, so that whereas Joan can be described as Fred\u2019s mistress, Fred\ncannot be described as Joan\u2019s master. Other pairs of words which reflect similar\ndifferentiation are boy\u2013girl, man\u2013woman, gentleman\u2013lady, bachelor\u2013spinster, and\neven widower\u2013widow. In the last case, whereas you can say \u2018She\u2019s Fred\u2019s widow,\u2019\nyou cannot say \u2018He\u2019s Sally\u2019s widower.\u2019 Lakoff cites numerous examples and\nclearly establishes her point that \u2018equivalent\u2019 words referring to men and women\ndo have quite different associations in English. A particularly telling example\nis the difference between \u2018He\u2019s a professional\u2019 and \u2018She\u2019s a professional.\u2019 Other\ninvestigators have documented the same phenomenon in other languages, for\nexample in French uses of gar\u00e7on and fille.\nOne of the consequences of such work is that there is now a greater aware-\nness in some parts of the community that subtle, and sometimes not so subtle,\ndistinctions are made in the vocabulary choice used to describe men and women.\nConsequently, we can understand why there is a frequent insistence that neutral\nwords be used as much as possible, as in describing occupations e.g., chair-\nperson, letter carrier, salesclerk, and actor (as in \u2018She\u2019s an actor\u2019). If language\ntends to reflect social structure and social structure is changing, so that judgeships,\nsurgical appointments, nursing positions, and primary school teaching assign-\nments are just as likely to be held by women as men (or by men as women),\nsuch changes might be expected to follow inevitably. This kind of work does\ntwo things: it draws our attention to existing inequities, and it encourages us to\nmake the necessary changes by establishing new categorizations (e.g., Ms), and\nsuggesting modifications for old terms (e.g., changing policeman to police officer\nand chairman to chairperson). However, there is still considerable doubt that\nchanging waitress to either waiter or waitperson or describing Nicole Kidman\nas an actor rather than as an actress indicates a real shift in sexist attitudes.\nReviewing the evidence, Romaine (1999, pp. 312\u201313) concludes that \u2018attitudes\ntoward gender equality did not match language usage. Those who had adopted\nmore gender-inclusive language did not necessarily have a more liberal view of\ngender inequities in language.\u2019\nOne particular bit of sexism in languages that has aroused much comment is\nthe gender systems that so many of them have, the he\u2013she\u2013it \u2018natural\u2019 gender\nsystem of English or the le\u2013la or der\u2013die\u2013das \u2018grammatical\u2019 gender systems of\nFrench and German. The possible connections between gender systems (mascu-\nline, feminine, neuter) and gender differences (male, female, neither) are vari-\nous. See Romaine (1999) for some observations and claims concerning these\nconnections, e.g., her claim (p. 66) that \u2018ideological factors in the form of\ncultural beliefs about women...enter into gender assignment in [grammatical]\nsystems that are supposedly purely formal and arbitrary.\u2019 In English such con-\nnections sometimes create problems for us in finding the right pronoun:\ncompare the natural \u2018Everybody should hand in their papers in five minutes\u2019\nAITC13 319 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 320 Gender\nto the apparently biased \u2018No person in his right mind would do that.\u2019 Again,\nhe\u2013she distinctions can often be avoided \u2013 sometimes clumsily, to be sure \u2013 so\nit probably does not follow that languages with gender distinctions must be\nsexist, which would also be a clear argument in support of the Whorfian\nhypothesis (see pp. 221\u20138). It is the people who use languages who are or who\nare not sexist; Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Turkish do not make the kinds\nof gender distinctions English makes through its system of pronouns, but it\nwould be difficult to maintain that males who speak these languages are less\nsexist than males who speak English!\nThere certainly are gender differences in word choice in various languages.\nJapanese women show they are women when they speak, for example, by the\nuse of a sentence-final particle ne or another particle wa. In Japanese, too, a\nmale speaker refers to himself as boku or ore whereas a female uses watasi or\natasi. Whereas a man says boku kaeru \u2018I will go back\u2019 in plain or informal\nspeech, a woman says watasi kaeru wa (Takahara, 1991). Children learn to\nmake these distinctions very early in life. However, Reynolds (1998, p. 306)\npoints out that \u2018the use of boku...by junior high school girls has recently\nbecome quite common in Tokyo. Girls who were interviewed in a TV program\nexplain that they cannot compete with boys in classes, in games or in fights with\nwatasi....The use of boku and other expressions in the male speech domain\nby young female speakers has escalated to a larger area and to older groups of\nspeakers.\u2019 In polite conversation a female speaker of Thai refers to herself as\nd\u00ecchAn whereas a man uses pho\u02c7m. In Thai, too, women emphasize a repeated\naction through reduplication, i.e., by repeating the verb, whereas men place a\ndescriptive verb, mak, after the verb instead.\nDifferent languages do seem to prescribe different forms for use by men and\nwomen. To cite another example, according to Sapir (1929a), the Yana language\nof California contains special forms for use in speech either by or to women.\nHowever, very few are like the language of the Dyirbal people of North Queens-\nland, Australia, who have a special language which is gender-differentiated in a\nrather novel way (Dixon, 1971). The normal everyday language, Guwal, is used\nby both genders; but, if you are a man and your mother-in-law is present, or\nif you are a woman and your father-in-law is present, you use Dyal\u00bauy, a\n\u2018mother-in-law\u2019 variety. This variety has the same phonology and almost thesame\ngrammar as Guwal but its vocabulary is entirely different. However, bothgenders\nhave access to both varieties.\nAnother Australian aboriginal language, Yanyuwa, spoken by approximately\n90 to 150 people, has gender-differentiated dialects. The dialects use the same\nword stems but there are different class-marking prefixes on nouns, verbs, and\npronouns. According to Bradley (1998), men use one dialect among themselves\nand women use the other. Men also use men\u2019s dialect to speak to women and\nwomen use women\u2019s dialect to speak to men. Children are brought up in\nwomen\u2019s dialect with boys required to shift \u2013 not always done easily \u2013 to\nmen\u2019s dialect as they are initiated into manhood. Bradley adds (p. 16) that: \u2018If\nindividuals wish to speak Yanyuwa then they are expected to speak the dialect\nwhich is associated with their sex \u2013 there is no other alternative.\u2019 A person\ncan use the other sex\u2019s dialect only in very well-defined circumstances such as\nAITC13 320 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 321\nstory-telling, joking, and certain singing rituals. The Yanyuwa find all of this\nperfectly normal and natural.\nIn the Dyirbal example cited above we may find an important clue as to\nwhy there are sometimes different varieties for men and women. One variety\nmay be forbidden to one gender, i.e., be taboo, but that gender is apparently\nnearly always the female gender. (See pp. 238\u201340.) This phenomenon has been\nnoted among the Trobriand Islanders, various aboriginal peoples of Australia,\nMayans, Zulus, and Mongols, to cite but a few examples. The taboos often\nhave to do with certain kinship relationships or with hunting or with some\nreligious practice and result in the avoidance of certain words or even sounds\nin words. They derive from the social organization of the particular group\ninvolved and reflect basic concerns of the group. Such concerns quite often lead\nto women being treated in ways that appear inimical to egalitarian-oriented\noutsiders.\nWhen we turn to certain grammatical matters in English, we find that Brend\n(1975) claims that the intonation patterns of men and women vary somewhat,\nwomen using certain patterns associated with surprise and politeness more often\nthan men. In the same vein, Lakoff says that women may answer a questionwith\na statement that employs the rising intonation pattern usually associated with\na question rather than the falling intonation pattern associated with making a\nfirm statement. According to Lakoff, women do this because they are less sure\nabout themselves and their opinions than are men. For the same reason, she says\nthat women often add tag questions to statements, e.g., \u2018They caught the robber\nlast week, didn\u2019t they?\u2019 These claims about tag questions and insecurity have\nbeen tested by others (Dubois and Crouch, 1975, Cameron et al., 1989, and\nBrower et al., 1979) and found wanting: experimental data do not necessarily\nconfirm intuitive judgments. The latter investigators did find, however, that the\ngender of the addressee was an important variable in determining how a speaker\nphrased a particular question.\nWe have already seen at other places in this book instances of language\nbehavior varying according to gender. Many of these are quantitative studies in\nwhich sex is used as one of the variables that are taken into account. As Milroy\nand Gordon (2003, p. 100) say, \u2018Strictly speaking...it makes sense...to talk\nof sampling speakers according to sex, but to think of gender as the relevant\nsocial category when interpreting the social meaning of sex-related variation.\u2019 I\nwill remind you of a few of these studies. Fischer\u2019s work (see pp. 162\u20133) showed\nhow very young boys and girls differ in certain choices they make, as did\nCheshire\u2019s work in Reading (pp. 170\u20132) in an older group. Labov\u2019s studies in\nNew York (pp. 164\u20138) and Philadelphia (pp. 209\u201311) also revealed noticeable\ngender differences in adult speech. These led him to make some interesting\nclaims about what such differences indicated, e.g., about women\u2019s role in lan-\nguage change. The Milroys\u2019 study exploring network relationships (pp. 181\u20133)\nshowed certain characteristics of men\u2019s and women\u2019s speech: how they were\nalike in some ways but different in others. Jahangiri\u2019s study in Teheran (pp.\n179\u201380) is of interest because of the very clear differences he reported between\nthe speech of males and females. Finally, Gal\u2019s study in the Oberwart of Austria\n(pp. 205\u20136) showed how it is not only what women say but who they are\nAITC13 321 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 322 Gender\nwilling to say it to that is important. We have also noted that there are often\ndifferent politeness requirements made of men and women.\nStill other gender-linked differences are said to exist. Women and men may\nhave different paralinguistic systems and move and gesture differently. The\nsuggestion has been made that these often require women to appear to be sub-\nmissive to men. Women are also often named, titled, and addressed differently\nfrom men. Women are more likely than men to be addressed by their first names\nwhen everything else is equal, or, if not by first names, by such terms as lady,\nmiss, or dear, and even baby or babe. Women are said to be subject to a wider\nrange of address terms than men, and men are more familiar with them than\nwith other men. Women are also said not to employ the profanities and obscen-\nities men use, or, if they do, use them in different circumstances or are judged\ndifferently for using them. (However, the successful American television series\n\u2018Sex and the City\u2019 might seriously challenge that idea!) Women are also some-\ntimes required to be silent in situations in which men may speak. Among the\nAraucanian Indians of Chile, men are encouraged to talk on all occasions, but\nthe ideal wife is silent in the presence of her husband, and at gatherings where\nmen are present she should talk only in a whisper, if she talks at all.\nSome writers are not impressed with the kinds of findings reported in the pre-\nceding paragraphs. These findings come from quantitative, variationist studiesof\nthe kind I discussed in chapters 6\u20138. For example, Cameron (1998a, pp. 945\u20136)\nsays that these findings \u2018belong to the tradition of empirical sex difference\nstudies that do no more than set out to find statistically significant differences\nbetween women\u2019s and men\u2019s behavior. This research formula has proved as\ndurable as it is dubious (not to say dull).\u2019 She adds that this kind of work \u2018deals\nin arcane sound changes presented through complex statistics.\u2019 In this view,\nmerely to observe, count, and graph linguistic phenomena is not enough. An\ninvestigator needs some kind of theory about such behavior and some ideas to\ntest before beginning an investigation. And, possibly, as we will see, some kind\nof ideology to suggest the \u2018right\u2019 theory.\nIn setting out a list of what she calls \u2018sociolinguistic universal tendencies,\u2019\nHolmes (1998) does offer some testable claims. There are five of these:\n1. Women and men develop different patterns of language use.\n2. Women tend to focus on the affective functions of an interaction more often\nthan men do.\n3. Women tend to use linguistic devices that stress solidarity more often than\nmen do.\n4. Women tend to interact in ways which will maintain and increase solidarity,\nwhile (especially in formal contexts) men tend to interact in ways which will\nmaintain and increase their power and status.\n5. Women are stylistically more flexible than men.\nIt is through testing claims such as these that we are likely to refine our under-\nstanding of those matters that interest us.\nThere are differences in gendered speech, some undoubtedly real but others\nalmost certainly imaginary. Any differences that do exist surely also mustinteract\nAITC13 322 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 323\nwith other factors, e.g., social class, race, culture, discourse type, group mem-\nbership, etc. In the next section we will look more closely at some possible\nexplanations for them. We will also try to avoid examining women\u2019s speech in\nrelation to men\u2019s speech as though the latter provides the norm. (To show just\nhow \u2018normal\u2019 that is, the paragraph on p. 322 beginning \u2018Still other gender-\nlinked...\u2019 was deliberately written in that way. You might try to recast it using\nwomen\u2019s language behavior as the norm.)\nDiscussion\n1. Lakoff (1973, pp. 50\u20132) says that, in each of the following pairs, it is quite\nclear which utterance is used only by females:\n1a. Oh dear, you\u2019ve put the peanut butter in the refrigerator again.\n1b. Shit, you\u2019ve put the peanut butter in the refrigerator again.\n2a. What a terrific idea!\n2b. What a divine idea!\nWhat is your opinion? How do you explain any difference in usage?\n2. When do you use the words boy(s) and girl(s) to refer to members of your\nown sex or of the other sex? Are there any uses of these words that you\nhear but refuse to employ yourself? Why? Has this always been the case?\nIf not, why not?\n3. How do you use the words lady and woman? Do you ever use combina-\ntions such as lady doctor or woman executive? Do you use cleaning lady,\ncleaning woman, or some other term? Are lady and woman synonymous?\n4. Whereas a young man may sometimes be referred to as a stud, dude, or guy,\na young woman may be referred to as a broad, chick, dame, doll, fox, or dog.\nYou might know some other terms too. Are there any fairly clear semanticdif-\nferences between the two sets? If there are, what would you say theyindicate?\n5. How do you address men and women who hold equivalent positions? Do\nyou make any kind of distinction by gender? How do such people address\nyou? Is there a difference according to whether they are male or female?Do\nthey address someone of the same age as yourself but of different gender\nin the same manner?\n6. Check the etymologies of the following words: lady, lord, woman, female,\nspinster, witch, housewife. Any conclusions?\n7. What are your views of proposed new words like chairperson, anchor-person,\nspokesperson, craftsperson, personslaughter, personhandle, and personhood?\n8. In March, 1991, Mayor David Dinkins of New York City referred to\nmilitary personnel returning from the Gulf War as \u2018our heroes and she-\nroes.\u2019 Any comment?\n9. Are words like masterpiece, masterful, mastery, and to master sexist?\n10. Sex and grammatical gender are different. What do the following French\nwords refer to: la sentinelle, un mannequin, la recrue, and un laideron?\nAITC13 323 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 324 Gender\n11. Holborow (1999, p. 192) offers the following criticism of gender studies:\n\u2018it is cooperation between men and women for social purposes not com-\npetition that has...been decisive historically, and...social divisions are\nmore significant than sexual ones.\u2019 She claims that differences associated\nwith gender are not the same as those arising from social class. The latter\nare far more important than the former. Indeed, concentration on gender\ndifferences may undermine our understanding of how language really func-\ntions in our lives, men and women alike. How tenable is such a view?\n12. There are many magazines oriented toward a specific gender. Can you\ndistinguish a magazine\u2019s orientation by its linguistic choices alone?\n13. Some newspapers and magazines carry columns devoted to men and women\nseeking other men and women for a variety of purposes. How do those\nusing such columns label themselves and those they seek? What do such\nlabels reveal about any of the issues discussed in this chapter?\n14. Check the definitions of person, man, and woman in a variety of diction-\naries, including as many old ones as you can find. Are you uncomfortable\nwith any of them?\nPossible Explanations\nWhen we turn to matters having to do with how men and women use language\nin a wider sense, that is, in social interaction and to achieve certain ends, we find\nclues to possible explanations for the differences we encounter. One analysis of\nhow women are presented in a set of cartoons produced some interesting findings\n(Kramer, 1974). The cartoons were taken from thirteen issues of The New\nYorker magazine published between February 17 and May 12, 1973. The an-\nalysis showed that, when both genders were represented in the cartoon, men\nspoke twice as much as women. In the cartoons men and women also spoke on\ndifferent topics, with men holding forth on such topics as business, politics, legal\nmatters, taxes, and sports, and women on social life, books, food and drink,\nlife\u2019s troubles, and lifestyle. Women spoke less forcefully than men, and men\nswore much more than women. Men were also more blunt and to the point in\ntheir speaking. There was also some evidence that the use of words like nice\nand pretty was gender-linked. Although such cartoons are not actual records\nof what happens in speech, they must be based on what people think happens\nif they are to be effective. They make use of the stereotypes we have about the\nspeech of men and women. Let us look at some better evidence freed from such\nstereotyping.\nIn conversations involving both men and women many researchers agree\nthat men speak more than women do. One also found that when men talked to\nmen, the content categories of such talk focused on competition and teasing,\nsports, aggression, and doing things. On the other hand, when women talkedto\nwomen, the equivalent categories were the self, feelings, affiliation with others,\nhome, and family. Women are also reported to use more polite forms and more\nAITC13 324 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 325\ncompliments than men. In doing so, they are said to be seeking to develop\nsolidarity with others in order to maintain social relationships. On the other\nhand, men are likely to use talk to get things done. However, these are tenden-\ncies only; men also try to bond and women also try to move others to action.\nMills (2003) contests the view that women are more polite than men. She says\nthat \u2018politeness\u2019 is not a property of utterances; it is rather \u2018a set of practices or\nstrategies which communities of practice develop, affirm, and contest\u2019 (p. 9).\nPoliteness requirements vary by situation and there is no overall imperative to\nbe polite to others; we can be impolite too and other views of politeness are\nincorrect (see p. 276). While there may be a stereotypical, white, middle-class\n(and largely female) idea of what politeness is, it is not widely shared (although\nit is extremely influential in the literature on politeness). \u2018For some women, this\nstereotype may be important, but for others it may be something which they\nactively resist and reject\u2019 (p. 214). Politeness \u2018is clearly a resource which\ninteractants use to structure their relations with others, and they are able to be\nself-reflexive about their own and others\u2019 use of politeness and impoliteness\u2019\n(pp. 245\u20136).\nWhen the two genders interacted, men tended to take the initiative in conver-\nsation, but there seemed to be a desire to achieve some kind of accommodation\nso far as topics were concerned: the men spoke less aggressively and competi-\ntively and the women reduced their amount of talk about home and family. A\nthorough review of the literature by James and Drakich (1993) showed incon-\nsistency in the findings when fifty-six studies of talk either within or between\ngenders were examined. What was important in determining who talked was\n\u2018the context and the structure of the social interaction within which gender dif-\nferences are observed\u2019 (p. 281). James and Drakich add (pp. 302\u20133):\nwomen are expected to use and do use talk to a greater extent than men to serve\nthe function of establishing and maintaining personal relationships (this is not\nsurprising, as the responsibility for interpersonal relationships primarily rests with\nwomen); for example, as we have observed, women, to a greater extent than men,\nare expected to talk, and do talk, simply in order to keep the interaction flowing\nsmoothly and to show goodwill toward others, and they are expected to talk, and\ndo talk, about personal feelings and other socioemotional matters relevant to\ninterpersonal relationships to a greater extent than men...what is particularly\nimportant in female friendships is the sharing of intimate feelings and confidences\nthrough talk, whereas in male friendships the sharing of activities is moreimportant.\nAnother interesting claim is that in cross-gender conversations men frequently\ninterrupt women but women much less frequently interrupt men (Zimmerman\nand West, 1975). James and Clarke (1993) looked at fifty-four studies that\naddressed the claim that men are much more likely than women \u2018to use inter-\nruption as a means of dominating and controlling interactions\u2019 (p. 268). They\nreport that the majority of studies have found no significant differences between\ngenders in this respect and both men and women interrupt other men andwomen.\nHowever, according to James and Clarke, \u2018A small amount of evidence exists\nthat females may use interruptions of the cooperative and rapport-building type\nto a greater extent than do males, at least in some circumstances\u2019 (p. 268).\nAITC13 325 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 326 Gender\nStill another claim is that there is evidence that in cross-gender conversation\nwomen ask more questions than men, encourage others to speak, use more\nback-channeling signals like mhmm to encourage others to continue speaking,\nuse more instances of you and we, and do not protest as much as men when\nthey are interrupted. On the other hand, men interrupt more, challenge, dispute,\nand ignore more, try to control what topics are discussed, and are inclined to\nmake categorical statements. Such behaviors are not characteristic of women in\nconversations that involve both men and women. In other words, in their\ninteractional patterns in conversation, men and women seem often to exhibit\nthe power relationship that exists in society, with men dominant and women\nsubservient.\nIf different behaviors are sometimes found in cross-gender communication,\nwhat do we find within same-gender groups? Coates (1996) discusses conversa-\ntion among women friends. She analyzed over nineteen hours of recorded con-\nversation among women interacting socially in small groups. Coates admits that\nshe is no longer a \u2018dispassionate investigator\u2019 of language. She is a middle-class\nwoman and feminist, and an ethnographer who puts women at the center of her\nwork. She says (p. 39) that her work shows that among the groups she looked\nat \u2018friendships with women are a constant in women\u2019s lives.\u2019 In such conversa-\ntions women tell and exchange stories, constantly hedge what they say, use\nquestions to invite others to talk, i.e., for conversational maintenance, and often\nrepeat what others say. Such talk is collaborative and establishes a feeling of\nsolidarity among those who use it.\nIn still another study, this time one that used an experimental setting, Freed\nand Greenwood (1996) recorded and analyzed the casual conversations of ap-\nproximately thirty-five minutes each of eight same-sex pairs of friends, four\nmale and four female. They focused particularly on the use of you know and\nquestions. The setting of each of the 35-minute conversations was manipulated\nso that each conversation provided a period of \u2018spontaneous\u2019 talk, one of \u2018con-\nsidered\u2019 talk, and finally one of \u2018collaborative\u2019 talk. Freed and Greenwood found\nno differences in the use of you know and questions: \u2018Women and men of the\nsame speech community, speaking in same-sex pairs in the same conversational\ncontext, with equal access to the conversational floor, do not differ either in the\nfrequency of the use of you know or in the number of questions uttered\u2019 (p. 3).\nWomen and men also use you know and questions for the same purposes. It is\nthe linguistic task or the speaking situation that determines the style of speaking\nnot the gender of the speaker. They add (p. 22) that \u2018just as the communicative\nstyle of women has been overly stereotyped as cooperative, so too the verbalstyle\nof men has been overgeneralized as competitive and lacking in cooperativeness.\u2019\nWhen we do observe gender differences in language behavior we are con-\nfronted with the task of trying to explain them. One explanation is that lan-\nguages can be sexist. I will have a little more to say about this idea later. For\nnow, three other claims are of interest. The first claim is that men and women\nare biologically different and that this difference has serious consequences for\ngender. Women are somehow predisposed psychologically to be involved with\none another and to be mutually supportive and non-competitive. On the other\nhand, men are innately predisposed to independence and to vertical rather than\nAITC13 326 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 327\nhorizontal relationships. There appears to be little or no evidence for this claim;\nit seems rather to be a clear case of stereotyping, which offers no more than a\nfacile solution to a difficult problem.\nThe second claim is that social organization is best perceived as some kind\nof hierarchical set of power relationships. Moreover, such organization by power\nmay appear to be entirely normal, justified both genetically and evolutionarily,\nand therefore natural and possibly even preordained. Language behavior reflects\nmale dominance. Men use what power they have to dominate each other and,\nof course, women, and, if women are to succeed in such a system, they must\nlearn to dominate others too, women included. Men constantly try to take\ncontrol, to specify topics, to interrupt, and so on. They do it with each other\nand they do it with women, who, feeling powerless, let them get away with it,\npreferring instead to seek support from other women. Consequently, since women\nare relatively powerless they opt for more prestigious language forms to protect\nthemselves in dealing with the more powerful. At the same time the use of such\nforms serves to mark them off from equally powerless males of the same social\nclass. Women may also have weaker social networks than men but they show\na greater sensitivity to language forms, especially standard ones.\nLakoff (1975) adopts the position that men are dominant and women lack\npower. Women may have to behave more like men if this unequal relationship\nis to be changed. Others share Lakoff\u2019s view. For example, DeFrancisco (1997,\np. 39) proposes that \u2018power be placed at the centre of [feminist] analysis and\nthat gender, race, ethnicity, social class, age, sexual orientation, and other social\ncategories be examined as political tools of oppression.\u2019 Crawford (1995) is\nanother who declares that power relations best explain what happens when men\nand women interact linguistically. Her explicit goal is \u2018to create a feminist social\nscience for all women\u2019 (p. 8). Talbot (1998, pp. 133\u20134) sounds a cautionary\nnote: \u2018A major determinant [of the dominance framework] is that male domin-\nance is often treated as though it is pan-contextual. But...all men are not in\na position to dominate all women.\u2019 Furthermore, anthropologists have pointed\nout that women are never without power and effectively control some societies.\nDominance clearly fails as a universal explanation of gendered language\ndifferences.\nThe third claim, which does not actually deny the second claim, is that men\nand women are social beings who have learned to act in certain ways. Language\nbehavior is largely learned behavior. Men learn to be men and women learn tobe\nwomen, linguistically speaking. Society subjects them to different lifeexperiences.\nThis is often referred to as the difference (sometimes also deficit) view asopposed\nto the dominance view just mentioned.\nMaltz and Borker (1982) propose that, in North America at least, men and\nwomen come from different sociolinguistic sub-cultures. They have learned to\ndo different things with language, particularly in conversation, and when thetwo\ngenders try to communicate with each other, the result may be miscommunication.\nThe mhmm a woman uses quite frequently means only \u2018I\u2019m listening,\u2019 whereas\nthe mhmm a man uses, but much less frequently, tends to mean \u2018I\u2019m agreeing.\u2019\nConsequently, men often believe that \u2018women are always agreeing with them\nand then conclude that it\u2019s impossible to tell what a woman really thinks,\u2019\nAITC13 327 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 328 Gender\nwhereas \u2018women...get upset with men who never seem to be listening\u2019 (p.202).\nThey conclude that women and men observe different rules in conversing and\nthat in cross-gender talk the rules often conflict. The genders have differentviews\nof what questioning is all about, women viewing questions as part of conversa-\ntional maintenance and men primarily as requests for information; different\nconventions for linking; different views of what is or is not \u2018aggressive\u2019 linguistic\nbehavior, with women regarding any sign of aggression as personally directed,\nnegative, and disruptive, and men as just one way of organizing a conversa-\ntion; different views of topic flow and topic shift; and different attitudes toward\nproblem-sharing and advice-giving, with women tending to discuss, share, and\nseek reassurance, and men tending to look for solutions, give advice, and even\nlecture to their audiences. (See also Preisler, 1986.)\nTannen (1990, 1993, 1994, 1998) is undoubtedly the best-known proponent\nof the claim that women and men have been raised to live in different sub-\ncultures. Consequently, \u2018cross-cultural communication,\u2019 Tannen\u2019s words, can be\ndifficult. In various interesting and entertaining accounts, Tannen has tried to\nshow how girls and boys are brought up differently. Part of the socialization\nprocess is learning not only gender-related activities and attitudes but gender-\nrelated language behavior. We saw earlier in Fischer\u2019s study (pp. 162\u20133) how\nvery young children show that they have learned to act \u2018like boys and girls.\u2019\nGender differences in language become established early and are then used to\nsupport the kinds of social behavior males and females exhibit. It is mainly\nwhen males and females interact that the behavior each uses separately becomes\nnoticeable. As Holmes (1992, p. 330) says,\nThe differences between women and men in ways of interacting may bethe result\nof different socialisation and acculturation patterns. If we learn the ways of talking\nmainly in single sex peer groups, then the patterns we learn are likely to be sex-\nspecific. And the kind of miscommunication which undoubtedly occurs between\nwomen and men will be attributable to the different expectations each sex has of\nthe function of the interaction, and the ways it is appropriately conducted.\nOne consequence of such differences is that women\u2019s speech has often been\ndevalued by men, for, as Tannen rightly observes, her difference approach in no\nway denies the existence of male dominance (1993, p. 9). Tannen\u2019s solution is\nan interesting one, although one not without its critics. She believes that men\nand women should try to understand why they speak as they do and try to\nadapt to each other\u2019s styles. However, the self-help nature of her 1990 book\nYou Just Don\u2019t Understand might seem to thrust much of such work onto the\nshoulders (or tongues?) of women rather than men. Although by no means as\nbig a best-seller as John Gray\u2019s Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\n(1992), Tannen\u2019s book was widely acclaimed, so its message obviously spoke\nto many people, women in particular. As Talbot (1998) observes of the book,\nwith its appearance of objectivity and neutrality and its stress on differences and\nequality, Tannen\u2019s approach provides a \u2018comfortable explanation\u2019 (p. 139) for\nsome troublesome issues.\nA variation of the third claim is found in the concept of \u2018community of\npractice.\u2019 According to Eckert and McConnell-Ginet (1998), gender issues are\nAITC13 328 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 329\nessentially complex and not easy to separate from other issues. They deplore\n(p. 485) the fact that too often,\nGender is abstracted whole from other aspects of social identity, the linguistic\nsystem is abstracted from linguistic practice, language is abstracted from social\naction, interactions and events are abstracted from community and personal his-\ntory, difference and dominance are each abstracted from wider social practice, and\nboth linguistic and social behavior are abstracted from the communities in which\nthey occur.\nIn order to understand what is happening when people acquire and use lan-\nguage, we must try to understand the various communities of practice in which\npeople function. They explain this concept as follows (p. 490):\nA community of practice is an aggregate of people who come together around\nmutual engagement in some common endeavor. Ways of doing things, ways of\ntalking, beliefs, values, power relations \u2013 in short, practices \u2013 emerge in the course\nof their joint activity around that endeavor. A community of practice is different\nas a social construct from the traditional notion of community, primarily because\nit is defined simultaneously by its membership and by the practice in which that\nmembership engages. Indeed, it is the practices of the community and members\u2019\ndifferentiated participation in them that structures the community socially.\nThey add that various kinds of differences arise in such circumstances, including\ngender differences: \u2018gender is...produced and reproduced in differential forms\nof participation in particular communities of practice....The relations among\ncommunities of practice when they come together in overarching communities\nof practice also produce gender arrangements\u2019 (p. 491). Individuals participate\nin various communities of practice and these communities interact in various\nways with other communities. Since these processes of participation and inter-\naction are constantly changing, there is also constant reshaping of both indi-\nvidual identity and any kind of group identity, including gender identity. You\nmust learn to be a jock or a burnout, a particular kind of man or a particular\nkind of women, and, as we will see shortly (p. 332), any other kind of socially\ncategorized or gendered person. Individual identity is created through interac-\ntion with others and, as interactants change, so may identity.\nIf either of the last two claims is correct, we must be prepared to acknowledge\nthe limits of proposals that seek to eliminate \u2018sexist\u2019 language without first\nchanging the underlying relationship between men and women. Many of the\nsuggestions for avoiding sexist language are admirable, but some, as Lakoff\npoints out with regard to changing history to herstory, are absurd. Many changes\ncan be made quite easily: early humans (from early man); salesperson (from\nsalesman); ordinary people (from the common man); and women (from the fair\nsex). But other aspects of language may be more resistant to change, e.g., the\nhe\u2013she distinction. Languages themselves may not be sexist. Men and women\nuse language to achieve certain purposes, and so long as differences in gender\nare equated with differences in access to power and influence in society, we may\nexpect linguistic differences too. For both men and women, power and influence\nAITC13 329 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 330 Gender\nare also associated with education, social class, regional origin, and so on, and\nthere is no question in these cases that there are related linguistic differences.\nGender is still another factor that relates to the variation that is apparently\ninherent in language. While we may deplore that this is so, variation itself may\nbe inevitable. Moreover, we may not be able to pick and choose which aspects\nof variation we can eliminate and which we can encourage, much as we might\nlike to do so.\nAs still another example that gender differences in language may be social in\norigin rather than linguistic we can look at a study of norms and norm-breaking\nin Malagasy (Keenan, 1974). Among the Malagasy, men do not put others into\nsituations in which they may lose face. They use language subtly, try to maintain\ngood communication in their relationships, and avoid confrontations. They are\ndiscreet, they prefer indirectness as an expression of respect, and they are con-\nsidered to be able speechmakers: men\u2019s \u2018requests are typically delayed and inex-\nplicit, accusations imprecise, and criticisms subtle\u2019 (p. 141). We should note that\nmany of these characteristics of men\u2019s speech might be associated with women\u2019s\nspeech in another society. Therefore, how do women speak in Malagasy?\nWomen do not operate with the same set of rules. They openly and directly\nexpress anger toward others. They also criticize and confront, and men use them\nto do this. They can be direct and straightforward, and because they can be\nso, they perform tasks, such as interacting with strangers, buying and selling\nwhen these require negotiating a price, and reprimanding children, which men\nprefer not to perform. In this society, then, it is the men who are indirect and\nthe women (and children) who are direct. But the most interesting fact is that\nit is indirectness of speech which is prized in Malagasy society and regarded as\n\u2018traditional\u2019 and it is the men who employ it. On the other hand, \u2018direct speech\n...is associated with a loss of tradition, with contemporary mores\u2019 and it is\nfound among women and children (p. 142). Women are definitely inferior to\nmen in this society too, for \u2018where subtlety and delicacy [which are prized\ncharacteristics] are required in social situations, men are recruited,\u2019 but \u2018where\ndirectness and explicitness [necessary at times but not prized characteristics] are\ndesired in social situations, women are recruited\u2019 (p. 143). Consequently, once\nmore we can see how the speech of the genders reflects their relationship within\nthe total society.\nThe kinds of evidence we have looked at strongly suggests that men and\nwomen differ in the kinds of language they use because men and women often\nfill distinctly different roles in society. We may expect that the more distinct the\nroles, the greater the differences, and there seems to be some evidence to support\nsuch a claim, for the greatest differences appear to exist in societies in which the\nroles of men and women are most clearly differentiated. Since boys are brought\nup to behave like men in those societies and girls to behave like women, the\ndifferences are also perpetuated.\nIn societies that are less rigidly stratified and in which men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nroles are less clearly differentiated, we may expect to find a reflection of this\nsituation in the language that is used and also, if change in society is occurring,\nchange in the language too. This is, indeed, what we do find, as we saw in\nchapters 7 and 8: men and women, and even boys and girls, exhibit certain\nAITC13 330 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 331\ndifferences in language use in such cities as New York, Norwich, Reading, and\nBelfast. Most of those differences can be explained by the different positions\nmen and women fill in society. Men have more power and may be more assert-\nive; women tend to be kept \u2018in their place\u2019 but aspire quite often to a different\nand \u2018better\u2019 place. Women therefore appear to be more conscious of uses of\nlanguage which they associate with their \u2018betters\u2019 in society, that is, those they\nregard as being socially superior. They therefore direct their speech toward the\nmodels these provide, even to the extent in some cases of hypercorrection, as\nin the example from New York City (p. 167). Women, therefore, tend to be in\nthe vanguard of change toward the norms of the upper classes, and lower\nmiddle-class women are at the very front.\nOne consequence is that sometimes we view the speech of certain women as\nbeing hypercorrect. That too is a normative-laden concept. It assumes a correct\nmale norm and characterizes the female norm as deviant. Once again difference\nrather than deviance might be a better characterization, with the difference\narising from the different experiences that females and males have of the world.\nMen have power, even lower-class men. They are less influenced linguistically\nby others and, in the case of the lower working class, may seek solidaritythrough\nthe \u2018toughness\u2019 that nonstandard varieties of the language seem to indicate. If\nthey lead in any kind of change, such change may well be away from the norm\n(p. 202). Again, as I indicated earlier (pp. 205\u20136), women may not find appro-\npriate the kinds of solidarity that men seek through the use of a particular\nlanguage or certain kinds of language. The peasant women of Oberwart inAustria\nseek not Hungarian-speaking peasant husbands, but German-speaking worker\nhusbands and, in doing so, lead the traditionally bilingual peasant population\naway from Hungarian\u2013German bilingualism toward German monolingualism.\nWomen are not without solidarity; it is just a different kind of solidarity from\nthat of men and just as normal.\nAll deliberate attempts to change or modify languages to free them ofperceived\nsexism or make them gender-neutral are a form of language planning. Some-\ntimes the goal appears to be to force language to catch up to social change, and\nat other times it seems designed to bring about social change through mandating\nlanguage change. Whatever it is, it requires us to accept a very Whorfian view\nof the interrelationship of language and culture and is subject to all the difficult-\nies of interpretation and implementation that we saw in chapter 9. Here is\nPauwels\u2019 (1998, p. 228) statement of a similar position:\nThe aims of many feminist LP [langage planning] efforts are to expose the inequalit-\nies in the linguistic portrayal of the sexes which reflect and contribute to the\nunequal positions of women and men in society and to take action to rectify this\nlinguistic imbalance. Language action...is social action, and to bring about lin-\nguistic change is to effect social change.\n(See Pauwels, 2003, on attempts at language reform in a variety of countries.)\nSome feminists want to go further than \u2018cleaning up\u2019 the language and even\ndeny any possibility of \u2018neutrality.\u2019 Their expressed mission is to \u2018reclaim\u2019 lan-\nguage for themselves (see especially Lakoff, 1990, Penelope, 1990, Sellers, 1991,\nAITC13 331 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 332 Gender\nand Spender, 1985). Spender adopts a Whorfian view of language (see pp.221\u2013\n8), declaring (p. 3) that: \u2018Language helps form the limits of our reality. It is our\nmeans of ordering and manipulating the world. It is through language that we\nbecome members of a human community, that the world becomes comprehen-\nsible and meaningful, that we bring into existence the world in which we live.\u2019\nHowever, she goes much further than Whorf, asserting (p. 12) that \u2018the English\nlanguage has been literally man-made and...is still primarily under male con-\ntrol\u2019 and that males, as the dominant group, have produced language, thought,\nand reality. Penelope argues that women should be aware of \u2018the lies of the\nfathers\u2019 tongues\u2019 and of the \u2018Patriarchal Universe of Discourse.\u2019 Her view is that\nwomen should in a sense reinvent language for their own purposes, and many\nfeminists have indeed tried to develop their own linguistic conventions, e.g.,\nnon-competitive, non-interruptive speech, in order to \u2018liberate\u2019 women. How-\never, other feminists such as Cameron (1992) do not hold such strong views.\nThey would require intervention into language use on a grand scale. Any such\nintervention would have to be based not on any rational view of language\nbehavior but entirely on ideology.\nLanguage and gender studies have seen an interesting development in recent\nyears, known by such terms as queer linguistics and lavender linguistics. These\nstudies deal with the language of non-mainstream groups such as gays, lesbians,\nbisexuals, the transgendered, etc., and focus on \u2018sexuality\u2019 rather than sex or\ngender. In fact, a major claim is that the focus on sex or gender may have been\nmisdirected. In their book-length treatment of sexuality, Cameron and Kulick\n(2003) adopt a postmodern aproach heavily dependent on the ideas of Derrida,\nFoucault, and Lacan, and argue that a concept they call \u2018desire\u2019 should play a\ncentral role in trying to understand human behavior since \u2018\u201cdesire\u201dencompasses\nmore than just the preference for partners of the same or the other sex: it also\ndeals with the non-intentional, non-conscious and non-rational dimensions of\nhuman sexual life. The unconscious and irrational aspects of sexuality may not\nbe manifested on the surface of people\u2019s behaviour in the same way that their\nbehaviour displays the sexual identities they have consciously chosen (\u201cgay,\u201d\n\u201clesbian,\u201d \u201cstraight,\u201d etc.)\u2019 (p. 140). They argue that the issues of identity and\npower are less important, an argument that Bucholtz and Hall (2004) reject,\nclaiming that \u2018desire\u2019 is much too vague a concept to be useful and that issues\nof identity and power are not only relevant but essential in any research on such\nlanguage varieties. Just what the ultimate significance to the subject matter of\nthis chapter this concern for \u2018marginalized\u2019 groups will have is difficult to pre-\ndict. The research has produced some findings of interest to us, e.g., Barrett\u2019s\nstudy discussed on p. 117, and to ignore such findings would be to fall into the\ntrap of appearing to use \u2018power\u2019 oppressively. However, only time will tell if this\nwill ultimately prove to be a significant development.\nIt is also apparent, as Freed has indicated (2003, p. 706), that \u2018despite the\nenormity of our research results, the public representation of the way women\nand men speak is almost identical to the characterization provided thirty years\nago.\u2019 Too often researchers talk only to each other, research results are either\nignored or misrepresented, and stereotyped views continue to influence how\npeople think and behave.\nAITC13 332 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Gender 333\nMy own view is that men\u2019s and women\u2019s speech differ because boys and girls\nare brought up differently and men and women often fill different roles in\nsociety. Moreover, most men and women know this and behave accordingly. If\nsuch is the case, we might expect changes that make a language less sexist to\nresult from child-rearing practices and role differentiations which are less sexist.\nMen and women alike would benefit from the greater freedom of choice that\nwould result. However, it may be utopian to believe that language use will ever\nbecome \u2018neutral.\u2019 Humans use everything around them \u2013 and language is just a\nthing in that sense \u2013 to create differences among themselves. Speech may well\nbe gendered but there actually may be no easy solution to that problem.\nDiscussion\n1. Kramer\u2019s analysis of cartoons (see p. 324) may be worth replicating. What\ndo you find in some other set? You can also apply the same approach to\nillustrations in children\u2019s books, comic books, and other similar sources.\n2. Women are usually expected to react differently from men to jokes, particu-\nlarly risqu\u00e9 jokes. Describe any differences you have observed between men\nand women, not only in reactions to jokes but also to various other kinds\nof boisterous or playful linguistic behavior. Account for the differences.\n3. Graffiti tend to be a commonplace of modern life. You and someone of the\nopposite gender might try to collect graffiti from a couple of neighboring\nlocations, one frequented by males and the other by females, e.g., adjacent\nwashrooms. A comparison of the language used and the themes covered\nmight prove to be very interesting.\n4. A set of guidelines issued by an educational publishing house (Scott, Foresman\nand Company, 1972), one of many such sets issued by publishers and pro-\nfessional groups during the late twentieth century, e.g., the LinguisticSociety\nof America in 1995, advises substitutions of the kinds indicated below to\navoid sexist language and role-stereotyping in publications. How effective\nare such suggestions \u2013 another is King (1991) \u2013 likely to be?

How likely is it that certain child-rearing practices encourage different kinds\nof linguistic behavior in young boys and girls? Consider, for example, the\nfact that girls are often encouraged to participate with mothers in non-\ncompetitive domestic activities in which language is very important; on the\nother hand, boys may be expected to be more competitive, to play outside\nmore, and to be engaged in physical rather than social activity. They may\nalso have less contact with their fathers than their sisters have with their\nmothers. Can you think of any specific examples of linguistic usage that\nmay be explained in this way?\n6. Smith (1979, p. 138) makes the following observation about the relation-\nship between language and gender:\nwe must beware of relegating speech to the role of the \u2018symptom\u2019 of social\nrelations. Speech and language use itself may play an active role in thedevelop-\nment of the subjective aspects of gender identity and hence in the development\nand use of language itself.\nWhat opinions do you have on this matter, and what evidence seems to you\nto support those opinions?\n7. In Shaw\u2019s Pygmalion, Professor Higgins goes about transforming Eliza\nDoolittle by teaching her to talk like a lady. Colonel Pickering treats her like\na lady and ignores her talk. Eliza observes that any success she has is attri-\nbutable to Pickering\u2019s approach rather than to Higgins! Is there anything\nwe can learn about the relationship of language to behavior from Eliza\u2019s\nobservation?\n8. There is an ongoing debate about the desirability of single-sex classes within\nschools and of single-sex schools. Which arguments for and against seem to\nyou to be the strongest and which the weakest?\nFurther Reading\nGender is one of the great \u2018growth\u2019 areas in sociolinguistics and there is an\nabundant literature. Holmes and Meyerhoff (2003) provide very useful compre-\nhensive coverage, and other useful books are Baron (1986), Coates (1993, 1996),\nEckert and McConnell-Ginet (2003), Graddol and Swann (1989), Holmes (1995),\nKey (1996), Lakoff (1975), Pauwels (1998), Romaine (1999), Smith (1985), and\nTalbot (1998). Some recent collections of papers are Bergvall et al. (1996),\nCameron (1998c), Coates (1998), Hall and Bucholtz (1995), Kotthoff and Wodak\n(1997), and Cheshire and Trudgill (1998). See Swann (1993) for the language\nof boys and girls, Johnson and Meinhof (1997) for \u2018language and masculinity,\u2019\nCoates (2002) for the language of men, and Cameron and Kulick (2003), Livia\nand Hall (1997), and Leap (1996) for still other \u2018gendered\u2019 varieties of language.\nAITC13 334 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 335\n14 Disadvantage\nAs we have seen, each language exists in a number of different varieties, and\nindividuals vary in their language use according to occasion. Not every indi-\nvidual will necessarily command the same range of varieties as every other\nperson. Throughout the total linguistic community there will be a considerable\noverlap, a situation which seems necessary if there is to be good communi-\ncation. However, as we saw in chapter 2, such differences may exist within the\ntotal community that the variety (or varieties) spoken by one group may be\nquite unlike the variety (or varieties) spoken by some other group, while both\ngroups may still be said to be speaking the same language. In such circumstances\nwe may appreciate why a variety spoken by a group that has a favored position\nin society is likely to be accorded more prestige \u2013 and hence often comes to be\nused as a model for speakers of other varieties \u2013 than one spoken by a group\nthat is less favored. In this way, as we also saw in chapter 2, one variety may\neventually be promoted to serve as a standard for the whole community and\nbecome the norm against which all other varieties are judged.\nWe should observe that linguists are agreed that no variety of a language is\ninherently better than any other. They insist that all languages and all varieties\nof particular languages are equal in that they quite adequately serve the needs\nof those who use them. The only exceptions they recognize are pidgins, which\nare by definition restricted varieties, or the varieties we associate with people\nwho are impaired in some way, e.g., certain mentally or physically handicapped\npeople. A standard variety of a language is \u2018better\u2019 only in a social sense: it has\na preferred status; it gives those who use it certain social advantages; and it\nincreases their life chances. Nonstandard varieties tend to produce the opposite\neffect. These are some of the consequences that follow from elevating one var-\niety and denigrating others, but there is no reason to suppose that any one of\nthe varieties is intrinsically more worthy than any other. If the capital cities of\nEngland and France had been York and Avignon respectively, Standard English\nand Standard French today would be quite different from what they actuallyare,\nand speakers of RP and Parisian French would in such circumstances beregarded\nrather differently, as speaking somewhat peculiar local dialects that would not\nbe very helpful \u2018if you want to get on in the world.\u2019\nThis attitude that linguists have toward different languages and their different\nvarieties is not one that everyone else shares. Many people believe that some\nlanguages or varieties are better than others, e.g., that some languages are\nAITC14 335 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 336 Disadvantage\nparticularly \u2018beautiful,\u2019 others \u2018primitive,\u2019 some dialects more \u2018expressive,\u2019others\n\u2018deficient,\u2019 and so on. In other words, it is widely believed that you can be\nadvantaged or disadvantaged not just socially or esthetically, but also cognitively,\ni.e., intellectually, by the accident of which language or variety of a language\nyou happen to speak.\nIn this chapter I will look at two different linguistic situations which havebeen\nwidely discussed in terms of such disadvantage. One of these concerns certain\nsocial class differences in the use of language in England; the other is the variety\nof English found in the United States that is now usually referred to as African\nAmerican Vernacular English. In each case, one or more investigators have\npointed out important social and educational consequences of the linguistic\ndifferences that they believe to exist. We will attempt to look at some of thebasic\nfacts and issues and to assess the various claims that have been made about both\nthose linguistic differences and the consequences that are said to follow.\nCodes Again\nThe work of Bernstein, a British sociologist concerned with educational matters,\nhas been very influential, particularly in the United Kingdom and Germany.\nBernstein\u2019s interest is socialization, i.e., how a child acquires a specific cultural\nidentity and responds to that identity. In particular, he has been interested in the\nrole of language in socialization. Bernstein\u2019s work and theories have been widely\ndiscussed and both misconstrued and misrepresented, so it is not always easy to\ndetermine whether he actually said what he is said to have said. He has not\nalways helped his own case either, for his writings are often obscure and some-\ntimes ambiguous. Certain North Americans have been particularly critical of\nBernstein, as we will see, but he has not gone uncriticized on his own side of\nthe Atlantic either.\nBernstein\u2019s views of the relationship between language and culture are heavily\ninfluenced by his reading of Whorf (see chapter 9). On more than one occasion\nhe has pointed out how Whorf alerted him to what he calls the deep structure\nof linguistically regulated communication. Bernstein regards language as some-\nthing which both influences culture and is in turn influenced by culture. A child\ngrowing up in a particular linguistic environment and culture learns the lan-\nguage of that environment and that culture and then proceeds to pass on that\nlearning to the next generation. Bernstein believes that there is a direct and\nreciprocal relationship between a particular kind of social structure, in both its\nestablishment and its maintenance, and the way people in that social structure\nuse language. Moreover, this relationship is a continuing one in that it is handed\ndown from generation to generation. For Bernstein, a particular kind of social\nstructure leads to a particular kind of linguistic behavior and this behavior in\nturn reproduces the original social structure. Consequently, a cycle exists inwhich\ncertain social patterns produce certain linguistic patterns, which in turn repro-\nduce the social patterns, and so on.\nAITC14 336 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 337\nIndividuals also learn their social roles through the process of communica-\ntion. This process differs from social group to social group, and, because it is\ndifferent in each social group, existing role differences are perpetuated in society.\nWhat is of particular concern to Bernstein, therefore, are the quite differenttypes\nof language that different social groups employ. He claims that there are two\nquite distinct varieties of language in use in society. He calls one variety elabor-\nated code (originally formal code) and the other variety restricted code(originally\npublic code). According to Bernstein, these codes have very different character-\nistics. For example, elaborated code makes use of accurate \u2013 in the sense of\nstandard \u2013 grammatical order and syntax to regulate what is said; uses complex\nsentences that employ a range of devices for conjunction and subordination;\nemploys prepositions to show relationships of both a temporal and logical nature;\nshows frequent use of the pronoun I; uses with care a wide range of adjectives\nand adverbs; allows for remarks to be qualified; and, according to Bernstein(1961,\np. 169), \u2018is a language use which points to the possibilities inherent in a complex\nconceptual hierarchy for the organizing of experience.\u2019 In contrast, restricted\ncode employs short, grammatically simple, and often unfinished sentences of\npoor \u2013 in the sense of nonstandard \u2013 syntactic form; uses a few conjunctions\nsimply and repetitively; employs little subordination; tends toward a dislocated\npresentation of information; is rigid and limited in the use of adjectives and\nadverbs; makes infrequent use of impersonal pronoun subjects; confounds rea-\nsons and conclusions; makes frequent appeals to \u2018sympathetic circularity,\u2019 e.g.,\nYou know?; uses idioms frequently; and is \u2018a language of implicit meaning.\u2019\nIt is Bernstein\u2019s view that every speaker of the language has access to the\nrestricted code because all employ this code on certain occasions; e.g., it is the\nlanguage of intimacy between familiars. However, not all social classes haveequal\naccess to the elaborated code, particularly lower working-class people and their\nchildren, who are likely to have little experience with it. According to Bernstein\n(1972b, p. 173), the consequences of this unequal distribution are considerable.\nIn particular, children from the lower working class are likely to find themselves\nat a disadvantage when they attend school, in which extensive use is made of\nthe elaborated code. He says:\nthe different focusing of experience through a restricted code creates a major\nproblem of educability only where the school produces discontinuity between its\nsymbolic orders and those of the child. Our schools are not made for these chil-\ndren; why should the children respond? To ask the child to switch to an elaborated\ncode which presupposes different role relationships and systems of meaning with-\nout a sensitive understanding of the required contexts must create for the child a\nbewildering and potentially damaging experience.\nAccording to Bernstein, therefore, there are serious consequences for the chil-\ndren of the lower working class when they come to school because elaborated\ncode is the medium of instruction in schooling. When schools attempt todevelop\nin children the ability to manipulate elaborated code, they are really involved in\ntrying to change cultural patterns, and such involvement may have profound\nsocial and psychological consequences for all engaged in the task. Educational\nfailure is likely to be the result.\nAITC14 337 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 338 Disadvantage\nBernstein\u2019s theories have been employed in a variety of studies. A typical\nstudy is one by Henderson (1972), who investigated the language used by 100\nmothers to their 7-year-old children. The mothers were divided into a middle-\nclass (MC) group and a working-class (WC) group. Henderson reports that,\nrelative to working-class mothers, middle-class mothers report they favor theuse\nof abstract definitions, explicit rather than implicit definitions, and information-\ngiving strategies in answering children\u2019s questions, and they use language to\ntransmit moral principles and to indicate feelings. In contrast to a child from\nthe working class, a child from the middle class is oriented through language\nto principles as these relate to objects and persons and is given access to the\nsystems through which knowledge is acquired. Henderson\u2019s findings appear to\nsupport Bernstein\u2019s theory that social classes differ in their use of language and\npass these differences on from generation to generation. Henderson points out\n(p. 329) the consequences such findings have so far as education is concerned:\nIt should be apparent that the linguistic socialization of the MC child is critically\nrelevant to his ability to profit from the educational experience as this is currently\ndefined. There is little discontinuity between the symbolic orders of the school and\nthose to which he has been socialized through his family. Whereas for the working-\nclass child there is a hiatus between the symbolic orders of the school and those\nof his family. He is less oriented towards the meta-languages of control and innova-\ntion and the pattern of social relationships through which they are transmitted.\nThe genesis of educational failure, according to our findings, may well be foundin\nthe pattern of communication and control which are realizations and thus trans-\nmitters of specific subcultures.\nThe important word here is hiatus: there is a gap between what the lower\nworking-class child brings to school and what happens in school. Moreover,\npresent types of schooling do not close the gap, and child-rearing practices con-\ntinue to ensure that it exists in subsequent generations.\nBernstein (1972b, pp. 174\u20136) also shows his concern with what he calls\nposition-oriented and person-oriented families. In position-oriented families lan-\nguage use is closely related to such matters as close physical contact among\nmembers, a set of shared assumptions, and a preference for implicit rather than\nexplicit meaning in communication. On the other hand, in person-oriented\nfamilies language use depends less on these factors, and communication is more\nexplicit and more context-free, that is, less dependent for interpretation on such\nmatters as the physical surroundings. According to Bernstein, positionorientation\nleads to a strong sense of social identity with some loss of personal autonomy,\nwhereas person orientation fosters personal autonomy but at the expense of\nsocial identity. We can easily note how these two orientations relate to Bernstein\u2019s\nrestricted and elaborated codes, for position orientation appears to require less\ncomplexity and elaboration in language use than person orientation. Ammon\n(1994) likewise relates the use of restricted code to the closed, multiplex social\nnetworks typical of members of the working class or lower social classes in\ngeneral because \u2018for want of other resources [they are] more dependent on\nmutual assistance in everyday life, which also explains why solidarity usually\nAITC14 338 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 339\nranks high as a value among them\u2019 (p. 579). Such people, he says, are also more\nstatus-oriented (i.e., position-oriented) than person-oriented.\nOther investigators, many undoubtedly influenced by Bernstein\u2019s ideas, have\ncommented on the different ways in which adults in various social classes re-\nspond linguistically to their children. Cook (1971) found that lower working-\nclass mothers used more commands to their young children than did middle-class\nmothers, who preferred to point out to their children the consequences of what\nthey were doing, particularly the consequences to the mother\u2019s feelings; e.g.,\n\u2018Now you\u2019ve broken that cup and I am very angry.\u2019 Cook also found that lower\nworking-class mothers often relied on their positional authority to get their\nway, by saying things like \u2018I\u2019m your mother\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m telling you to do that.\u2019\nOther investigators, e.g., Newson and Newson (1970), found that working-class\nmothers invoke authority figures such as police officers in threatening their\nchildren. Robinson and Rackstraw (1967) found that middle-class mothers, far\nmore often than lower working-class mothers, tried to answer their children\u2019s\nWh-questions, i.e., information-seeking questions, with genuine explanations\nrather than with answers like \u2018Because I say so\u2019 or \u2018Because they do.\u2019 Such\nexplanations would involve causes, consequences, analogies, and so on. Similar\nevidence is reported from studies in the United States, e.g., Hess and Shipman\n(1965). In this study, middle-class mothers and lower working-class mothers,\nfaced with the task of helping their 4-year-old children in either block-sorting\ntasks or the use of an Etch-a-Sketch, revealed important differences in behavior,\nwith middle-class mothers far better able to help or instruct their children than\nlower working-class mothers, who were unable to offer much assistance to their\nchildren. In a discussion of their results, Hess and Shipman (1967, p. 79) point\nout how frustrated the child of a lower working-class mother must feel in such\ncircumstances. The child is often required to do things without any explanation\nbeing given, without adequate instructions, and without models for the desired\nbehavior; moreover, rewards and punishments seem quite random and, when\nthese do occur, punishments are usually more frequent and intense thanrewards.\nThese views are in accord with Bernstein\u2019s. It is his view that people in the\nmiddle class much more so than those in the working class employ language to\ndiscuss cause and effect, and moral principles and their application in bringing\nup children. They are more likely to encourage verbal interaction, less likely\nto avoid answering difficult questions and employ coercion, and more likely to\nemploy language to induce desired behavioral changes.\nBernstein believes that the British social-class system does not allow the lower\nworking class easy access to the elaborated code. Members of that class most\nfrequently use restricted code, which limits the intellectual horizons of its\nspeakers. We should note that in Bernstein\u2019s view it is the lower working class,\nnot the whole of the working class, who are penalized in this way; too often\nhis work is interpreted as a claim about the working class as a whole. Of course,\nBernstein and his followers must accept much of the responsibility for this\nmisunderstanding since they generally omit the word lower and appear to be\ndiscussing the whole of the working class. Among critics, however, Rosen (1972)\nhas criticized Bernstein on the ground that he has not looked closely enough at\nworking-class life and language and that many of the key terms in his work are\nAITC14 339 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 340 Disadvantage\nquite inadequately defined, e.g., code, class, elaborated, and so on. Many of the\narguments also appear to be circular in nature and the hypotheses weak.\nLabov (1972a) has echoed many of these criticisms and added a few of his\nown. He has argued that one cannot reason from the kinds of data presented\nby Bernstein that there is a qualitative difference between the two kinds ofspeech\nBernstein describes, let alone a qualitative difference that would result in cog-\nnitive and intellectual differences. For example, he says (1970, p. 84): \u2018The\ncognitive style of a speaker has no fixed relation to the number of unusual\nadjectives or conjunctions that he uses.\u2019 A quantitative difference does not estab-\nlish a qualitative one, particularly if the functions of language are ignored or\ndown-played. Many linguists would agree with Labov that it is not the range\nof devices that is found in a particular variety of language that is important so\nmuch as the way in which speakers actually use whatever devices exist. For\nexample, the English of a thousand years ago, Old English, lacked certain de-\nvices that Modern English has, but it would surely be false to claim that King\nAlfred was considerably less \u2018smart\u2019 than your next door neighbor as a con-\nsequence of this apparent \u2018deficiency.\u2019\nFor his part, Bernstein has tried to refute some of Labov\u2019s criticisms. He says\n(1990, p. 115) that the story told by Larry (see pp. 345\u20136) could bear adifferent\ninterpretation from that offered by Labov, i.e., that it shows good logical rea-\nsoning. Bernstein points out that Larry needs five probes to structure hisargument.\nThis example and another that Labov uses really show \u2018interchanges which are\nembedded in different social bases and thus founded upon different rules and\ncompetences\u2019 (p. 117). Bernstein adds that what is needed is \u2018less ad hoc ideol-\nogy and interpretation and a more systematic, general understanding of thesocial\nbasis of modalities of communication and their distributive principles and differ-\nential outcomes\u2019 (p. 118), which is what he is trying to gain through his work.\nBernstein is, of course, aware that not all of the language differences between\nworking-class children and middle-class children are advantageous to the latter.\nHe has acknowledged that young middle-class children do not tend to respond\nas uninhibitedly as their working-class counterparts in certain activities, for\nexample role-playing. Apparently, they often want to know what the rules are\nbefore they will play in this way because they want to avoid doing the wrong\nthing. There may also be an additional constraint at work in the use of elabor-\nated code: you tailor your language to fit the social occasion and particularly\nthe expectations that others have of you. Therefore, when you are unsure of, or\nconcerned with, those expectations, you may react by saying little and saying\nthat very carefully. In certain circumstances it will even be the case that users\nof the restricted code will be the more verbal, since they are unlikely to be as\nconcerned with the impression they are making on others.\nIn his work Bernstein has opened up an interesting area of investigation into\nthe varieties of language used by children. His views have been dismissed far too\nreadily by many linguists, who tend to reject all his claims because a few appear\nto be untenable. The kinds of data that Bernstein has presented raise important\nissues. Linguists generally approach these issues differently but it cannot really\nbe said that they have been any more successful than Bernstein in dealing with\nthem.\nAITC14 340 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 341\nDiscussion\n1. Try to elicit some examples of speech from several children. You should try\nto vary a number of factors. For example, you might try younger andolder\nchildren; spontaneous conversation, story-telling, and playing games with\nthem; formal and informal settings; individual and group activities; home\nand out-of-the-home settings; and so on. Try to determine as far as you can\ndo so how the different approaches affect what you can say about children\u2019s\nlanguage. Are there any characteristics which seem easier than others to\nassess, and, if so, why? You might also like to compare the techniques you\nemploy with the kinds of techniques for eliciting children\u2019s language that\nare described in books published for use by teachers, language consultants,\nspeech therapists, child psychologists, and so on. You should also look at\nthe advice that is often given in such sources about the significance of\ncertain results. Is any such advice questionable? And, if so, for what\nreasons?\n2. Try to design an experiment that will either confirm (or disconfirm) the\nexistence of restricted and elaborated codes. You might look at Bernstein\n(1972a, 1972b) for some guidance in this matter. You might also try to use\ncertain other possible measures of language differences if you can isolatetwo\n(or more) discrete varieties of speech, e.g., counting word production, meas-\nuring clause and\/or sentence length and\/or complexity, and so on. Youmight\nalso investigate some other sources for data concerning how different social\ngroups use forms of speech which might be called \u2018codes\u2019 of the kind that\ninterest Bernstein. Written sources might be useful, e.g., plays, short stories,\nand novels. It may be important, however, to assess the accuracy of the\npresentation of characters in such sources since stereotyping is a distinct\npossibility.\n3. According to Bernstein, education proceeds through the use of elaborated\ncode, although, of course, there are also many instances of the use ofrestricted\ncode in classrooms. Try to apply Bernstein\u2019s concept of the two codes to\nclassroom activity to see how useful they are. Do you find any instances of\nmisunderstanding which might be explained as failure to deal adequately\nwith a particular code?\n4. Bernstein has been criticized for saying that lower working-class speech\nhas certain characteristics and then going out to find confirmation of his\nclaims. Another approach might be to go out and collect data concerning\nsuch speech before making any hypotheses at all. How might you attemptto\norganize such a collection of linguistic data? What problems do you think\nmight arise in your work?\n5. Try to observe mothers controlling, disciplining, or explaining things to very\nyoung children. Try to find a \u2018naturalistic\u2019 method for collecting your data,\nbecause Hess and Shipman\u2019s study has been criticized on the ground that\nit used an experimental, hypothetical situation rather than a natural one,\ntherefore raising doubts about the generalizations you can make from it.\nWhat kinds of language do mothers use and what kinds of strategies do\nAITC14 341 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 342 Disadvantage\nthey employ? Do there appear to be differences that you can associate with\nclass or with other factors?\nAfrican American Vernacular English\nLinguists who have described the speech that is characteristic of many black\nresidents of the northern United States have noticed how uniform that speech\nis in many respects. In other words, blacks who live in New York City, Boston,\nChicago, Detroit, and Seattle speak very much alike, whereas the same cannot\nbe said of non-blacks who live in the same cities. The speech of blacks in these\ncities also resembles the speech of blacks in southern states in many respects. In\none respect this similarity is the result of the relatively recent migrations of\nblacks out of the south; in another, it is one reflection of long-standing patterns\nof racial segregation only now slowly changing, patterns which have tended to\nseparate the population of the United States along color lines. Linguists have\nreferred to this variety of speech as Black English, Black Vernacular English,\nand Afro-American Vernacular English. Today, the most-used term is African\nAmerican Vernacular English (AAVE) but Ebonics (a blend of Ebony andphonics)\nhas also recently achieved a certain currency.\nAAVE has certain phonological, morphological, and syntactic characteristics.\nWords like thing and this may be pronounced as ting and dis. Bath may sound\nlike baff, brother like bruvver, nothing like nuffin, and thread like tred. Still\nother examples are bik for big, kit for kid, and cup for cub, as final stops are\ndevoiced. Others may be lost. Test, desk, and end may be pronounced without\ntheir final consonants. The plural of test may actually be tess or tesses,depending\non how an individual forms the plural. Carol, Paris, protect, and from mayshow\nloss of r, and car and cart will nearly always show loss of r. As a result, your\nbrother may become identical to you brother. Cold may show loss of the final\nd (col\u2019) or even loss of both l and d (co\u2019), because l after a vowel is often deleted.\nThe result may be that bold and bowl become homophonous with bow.\nOne result of such losses is that there are likely to be quite differenthomophones\nin AAVE and in standard varieties of the language. Vowels may be nasalized and\nnasal consonants lost: run and end may just be in the first case an r followed\nby a nasalized vowel and in the second case a simple nasalized vowel with no\npronunciation at all of the final nd. The diphthongs in words like find and found\nmay be both monophthongized and nasalized, and the words may lack any\npronunciation of the final nd. Consequently, find, found, and even fond may\nbecome homophonous, all pronounced with an f and a following nasalized\nvowel.\nIn morphology, because final t and d are often unpronounced, there may be\nno overt signaling of the past tense, so that I walked sounds just like I walk.\nThere may also be no signaling of the third-person singular in the present tense\nof the verb, resulting in a form like he go. Tesses as a pronunciation of tests\nwould also indicate that there is no final t at all in the speaker\u2019s basic form of\nAITC14 342 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 343\nthe word, which has become for that speaker a word just like dress, with its\nplural dresses.\nSyntactically, AAVE has special uses of be, or lack of be (the zero copula),\nas in a contrast between \u2018He nice\u2019 (\u2018He is nice right now\u2019) and \u2018He be nice\u2019\n(\u2018He is nice sometimes\u2019). The negatives of these sentences would also be \u2018He\nain\u2019t nice\u2019 and \u2018He don\u2019t be nice,\u2019 respectively. \u2018You tired\u2019 may be an equivalent\nof the standard \u2018You\u2019re tired.\u2019 AAVE also employs constructions such as \u2018I asked\nJoe what can he do,\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t nobody do that\u2019 (as a statement), and \u2018It ain\u2019t no\nheaven for you to go to,\u2019 in which it functions like there in Standard English (or\nSE). Ain\u2019t is used frequently, as is multiple negation, and there are also special\nauxiliary verb uses of done and been, as in \u2018He done told me\u2019 and \u2018I been\nwashing it.\u2019\nOne of the most interesting characteristics of AAVE is the above-mentioned\nuse of the zero copula. As Labov (1969) has explained, the rule for its use is\nreally quite simple. If you can contract be in SE, you can delete it in AAVE. That\nis, since \u2018He is nice\u2019 can be contracted to \u2018He\u2019s nice\u2019 in SE, it can become \u2018He\nnice\u2019 in AAVE. Likewise, \u2018But everybody\u2019s not black\u2019 can become \u2018But everybody\nnot black.\u2019 However, \u2018I don\u2019t know where he is\u2019 cannot be contracted to \u2018I don\u2019t\nknow where he\u2019s\u2019 in SE and, consequently, it cannot become \u2018I don\u2019t know\nwhere he\u2019 in AAVE, nor can \u2018That\u2019s the way it is here\u2019 become \u2018That\u2019s the way\nit here.\u2019 The latter can become \u2018That the way it is here\u2019 (or even \u2018That the way\nit be here,\u2019 depending on whether the observation is being made only about the\npresent moment \u2013 it is \u2013 or about a habitual condition \u2013 it be). In both SE and\nAAVE the verb be must be realized in the last example.\nWe should note that the zero copula is very rarely found in the speech of\nwhites, even poor southern whites. Not all blacks use it, either. Labov (1972a)\nshows, for example, that zero copula use can be correlated with strength ofgroup\nmembership among certain black youths in Harlem, members of a gang called\nthe Jets. His work revealed that the gang had core members, secondarymembers,\nand peripheral members. Outside were non-members, who were called lames\nby the members. Zero copula use diminished as strength of group membership\ndecreased: core members had 45 percent zero copula use; secondary members\n42 percent; peripheral members 26 percent; and lames 21 percent. Even the\nlames, those black youths who are least closely associated with black culture,use\nthe zero copula 21 percent of the time: they show their \u2018blackness\u2019 through such\nuse. However, they use it much less than those who might be regarded as more\ntypical examples of both black culture and black linguistic usage. Obviously,\nthen, certain characteristics of AAVE indicate solidarity; indeed, the use of AAVE\nitself may be regarded as a strong solidarity marker for this ethnic group in\nthe United States. As Labov (1972a, p. 258) says, \u2018It is only by virtue of being\navailable and on the city street every day that anyone can acquire the deep\nfamiliarity with local doings and the sure command of local slang that are\nneeded to participate in vernacular culture.\u2019\nThe above are some of the more frequently noted characteristics of AAVE.\nLinguists, however, disagree on how AAVE relates to other varieties of English\nin the United States. Some, such as Kurath (1949, p. 6) and McDavid (1965,\np. 258), argue that it has no characteristics which are not found in othervarieties\nAITC14 343 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 344 Disadvantage\nof English, particularly nonstandard varieties spoken by Americans of any color\nin the south. This is sometimes called the Anglicist hypothesis of origin. In this\nview, AAVE is just another dialect of American English (see Wolfram and Schilling-\nEstes, 1998, pp. 175\u20138). That black speakers may produce greater quantities of\ncertain nonstandard usages is merely a peculiarity of the style of speaking they\nhave adopted. This claim that AAVE is a variety of southern United States\nEnglish is also quite compatible with another claim that is sometimes made: that\nthe speech of blacks in the southern states has had a considerable influence on\nthe speech of whites living there, e.g., in the latter\u2019s borrowing of such words\nas goober (\u2018peanut\u2019), buckra (\u2018white man\u2019), gumbo (a type of soup), and perhaps\njazz and banjo. Wolfram (2003) and Wolfram and Thomas (2002) take a slightly\ndifferent position, favoring a neo-Anglicist hypothesis that early African Ameri-\ncans maintained certain features of the languages they brought with them\nwhile at the same time accommodating to the local dialects of English. Wolfram\nand Thomas say that the substrate influence of the African languages still per-\nsists in AAVE, certainly in the variety they examined in Hyde County, North\nCarolina.\nDiametrically opposed to this view is the view of the creolists, e.g., Stewart\n(1967), Dillard (1972), and Rickford (1977, 1997, 1999a), who maintain that\nAAVE is of creole origin (see chapter 3), and therefore a variety of English\nwhich originated quite independently of SE. In this view, AAVE has features that\nare typical of creoles, particularly the zero copula, some residual Africanisms,\nand certain styles of speaking (such as rapping, sounding, signifying, rifting, and\nfancy talk), which look back to an African origin. AAVE, therefore, is not a\ndialect of English but a creolized variety of English which still, for many people,\nhas certain profound differences from the standard variety, differences which\nmust be acknowledged if we are to make wise decisions in matters affecting the\neducation of children. Ewars (1996) adopts a somewhat intermediate position\nthat the characteristics of AAVE are neither those of a variety of English of\ncreole origin nor those related to a specific variety of English. AAVE may have\n\u2018taken a development of its own\u2019 (p. 227). (See also Poplack, 2000.)\nA third view, that of linguists such as Labov (1972a), is that the issue of\nwhether or not AAVE originated as a creole is now moot. Labov claims that\nevery feature that you might be tempted to regard as unique to AAVE can be\nrelated \u2018by rule\u2019 to SE. What speakers of AAVE possess is basically the same\ngrammar that all speakers of English possess. Just as speakers of Cockney\nEnglish and Newfoundland English have special rules to produce their unique\nvarieties, so speakers of AAVE have their special rules; however, the core rules\nare alike for all. In this view, AAVE is just another variety of English.\nAnother issue that intrigues linguists is whether or not AAVE and SE are\nconverging or diverging. Bailey and Maynor (1989) say that they are diverging\nin the Brazon Valley in Texas, with only black speakers using constructions like\n\u2018He always be tryin\u2019 to catch up\u2019 and resisting the adoption of post-vocalic r in\nwords like farm. In this view the English of blacks and whites is diverging in\ncertain parts of the United States. Butters (1989) argues that there is no solid\nevidence to support such a claim, pointing out that there are both divergent and\nconvergent features. He says that AAVE is just like any other dialect of English;\nAITC14 344 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 345\nit has its own innovations but remains strongly influenced by the standard\nvariety. Wolfram (1990) also discusses the idea that these varieties are diverging\nand concludes that the evidence is \u2018flimsy\u2019 (p. 131). However, another review of\nthe evidence (Spears, 1992) finds some substance. There may actually, as just\nstated, be both convergence and divergence, for as Wolfram and Thomas say\n(p. 24), \u2018it is quite possible for particular structures, or structures on one level\nof language organization, to show convergence at the same time that other\nstructures indicate divergence.\u2019 Rickford (1999a, pp. 274\u20137) also points to\nevidence of both convergence and divergence in East Palo Alto, California, with\nblack adults showing evidence of convergence and black teenagers of divergence\nalthough whether the latter is mainly an age-graded phenomenon is not at all\nclear.\nWhatever theory about origins is correct and however opinions differ con-\ncerning the direction of change, we can be sure that there is such a variety of\nEnglish as AAVE in the United States. Labov (2001, pp. 506\u20138) says that it is\nalmost identical in cities such as Boston, New York, Detroit, Chicago, San\nFrancisco, and Los Angeles and shows none of the changes that are occurring\nin the white populations of these cities. Nor do blacks readily participate in the\nNCS (see p. 194). Those who speak AAVE recognize that what they speak is\nsomething different from the varieties employed by most non-blacks. Most\nAmericans are prepared to categorize someone who contacts them by telephone\nas either black or non-black using speech alone as the criterion, and most such\ncategorizations are correct. In cases of mis-categorization, it is usually because\nof special circumstances: a black person has been brought up among non-blacks,\nor a non-black has been brought up among blacks.\nDiscussion\n1. As an example of both AAVE and the logic that can be expressed in AAVE,\nLabov (1972a, pp. 214\u201315) cites the following conversation between Larry,\na 15-year-old core member of the Jets, a Harlem gang, and JL, aninterviewer:\nJL: What happens to you after you die? Do you know?\nLarry: Yeah, I know.\nJL: What?\nLarry: After they put you in the ground, your body turns into \u2013 ah \u2013\nbones, an\u2019 shit.\nJL: What happens to your spirit?\nLarry: Your spirit \u2013 soon as you die, your spirit leaves you.\nJL: And where does the spirit go?\nLarry: Well, it all depends...\nJL: On what?\nLarry: You know, like some people say if you\u2019re good an\u2019 shit, your\nspirit goin\u2019 t\u2019heaven...\u2019n\u2019 if you bad, your spirit goin\u2019 to hell.\nWell, bullshit! Your spirit goin\u2019 to hell anyway, good or bad.\nJL: Why?\nAITC14 345 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 346 Disadvantage\nLarry: Why? I\u2019ll tell you why. \u2019Cause, you see, doesn\u2019 nobody really\nknow that it\u2019s a God, y\u2019know, \u2019cause I mean I have seen black\ngods, pink gods, white gods, all color gods, and don\u2019t nobody\nknow it\u2019s really a God. An\u2019 when they be sayin\u2019 if you good, you\ngoin\u2019 t\u2019heaven, tha\u2019s bullshit, \u2019cause you ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to no heaven,\n\u2019cause it ain\u2019t no heaven for you to go to.\nWhat characteristics of AAVE are there in Larry\u2019s speech and how logical\nis his argument?\n2. The United Kingdom and Canada each contain a significant minority black\npopulation. In what ways does the speech of these people correspond to\nAAVE? In what way is it different? How relevant are statements and claims\nmade about AAVE to the situations that exist in the United Kingdom and\nCanada?\n3. To what extent might the relationship between AAVE and SE becharacterized\nas a diglossic one? (Refer back to chapter 4.)\nConsequences for Education\nThere has been widespread misunderstanding in the United States of AAVE,\nboth of its characteristics and of how it is used (see Mufwene et al., 1998). This\nmisunderstanding has had a number of unfortunate consequences. Many edu-\ncators regarded the various distinguishing characteristics of AAVE as deficien-\ncies: black children were deficient in language ability because their language did\nnot have certain features of the standard, and the consequence of that deficiency\nwas cognitive deficiency. This is sometimes called the Deficit hypothesis. For\nexample, Bereiter and Engelmann (1966, p. 39) state that such children show \u2018a\ntotal lack of ability to use language as a device for acquiring and processing\ninformation. Language for them is unwieldy and not very useful.\u2019 In the late\n1960s, this view led to certain proposals to teach black children the standard\nvariety of the language. To remedy the deficiencies they believed to exist, Bereiter\nand Engelmann proposed a program designed to teach black children how to\nspeak: e.g., how to make statements, to form negatives, to develop polar con-\ncepts (\u2018big\u2019 and \u2018little\u2019), to use prepositions, to categorize objects, and to perform\nlogical operations. In this view, black children suffered from \u2018verbal deprivation\u2019\nor \u2018had no language,\u2019 and it was the duty and responsibility of educators to\nsupply them with one. This view also found support among many African\nAmericans who looked down on AAVE. Lippi-Green (1997, p. 200) hasobserved\nthat \u2018It cannot be denied that some of the most scornful and negative criticism\nof AAVE speakers comes from other African Americans,\u2019 and from all walks of\nlife (see Rickford, 2004).\nLabov and others have been severely critical of such views, believing that they\ncompletely misrepresent the linguistic abilities of black children. These children\nspeak a variety of English which is different from the standard favored by\nAITC14 346 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 347\neducators, but it is neither deficient nor unsystematic. Indeed, the variety is both\nsystematic in itself and is also related systematically to the standard. Moreover,\nblack children live in a rich verbal culture in which linguistic ability is highly\nprized and in which many opportunities are offered for competition in verbal\nskill. To assume that such children cannot affirm, negate, categorize, or think\nlogically because they perform poorly in certain extremely inhibiting testing\nsituations is absurd. They must use language all the time in order to get by, and\nany fair test of linguistic ability shows them to be as skilled as any otherchildren.\nIn addition, black children have a rich store of verbal games (e.g., sounding,\nsignifying, toasts, rifting, louding, and so on) which encourage them to develop\ntheir verbal skills. That such children need \u2018compensatory education\u2019 for their\nlack of linguistic ability is a complete misinterpretation of the facts. They may\nneed some help in adjusting to certain middle-class values about how language\nis used in education, but that is a different matter and is a problem for many\nnon-black children too. Such views also assume that a major function of school-\ning is to indoctrinate working-class children into middle-class ways, withlanguage\ncentral to this process.\nIn questioning Bereiter and Engelmann\u2019s claim that black children appear to\nhave no language at all, \u2018the myth of verbal deprivation,\u2019 Labov (1972a) points\nout that, if you put a black child in front of an adult white interviewer who then\nproceeds to fire questions at that child, you may expect few responses (p. 185):\n\u2018The child is in an asymmetrical situation where anything he says can literallybe\nheld against him. He has learned a number of devices to avoid saying anything\nin this situation, and he works very hard to achieve this end.\u2019 Perhaps nowhere\nare the inadequacies of Bereiter and Engelmann\u2019s program more clearlyillustrated\nthan in the following incident recounted by Fasold (1975, pp. 202\u20133):\nA film showing the corrective program developed by a team of educational psych-\nologists for children alleged to have these language deficiencies was screened for\nlinguists at the 1973 Linguistic Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It contained the\nfollowing sequence:\nEarnest White teacher, leaning forward, holding a coffee cup: \u2018This-is-not-a-\nspoon.\u2019\nLittle Black girl, softly: \u2018Dis not no \u2019poon.\u2019\nWhite teacher, leaning farther forward, raising her voice: \u2018No, This-is-not-a-\nspoon.\u2019\nBlack child, softly: \u2018Dis not a \u2019poon.\u2019\nWhite teacher, frustrated: \u2018This-is-not-a-spoon.\u2019\nChild, exasperated: \u2018Well, dass a cup!\u2019\nThe reaction of the linguists, after they had finished applauding and cheering for\nthe child, was a mixture of amusement, incredulity, and anger.\nIt is quite apparent from the child\u2019s final frustrated response that children may\nbe much smarter than adults believe them to be, and sometimes, as in this case,\nsmarter than those who would help them.\nAfrican Americans are aware that African American children perform poorly\nin schools. Rickford (1999a, p. 305) paints a bleak picture of the school per-\nformance of black third- and fourth-graders in East Palo Alto, Californiabetween\nAITC14 347 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 348 Disadvantage\n1989 and 1993. Green (2002, pp. 28\u20139) shows how in a national study con-\nducted as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress about two-\nthirds of African American fourth-graders in inner city schools were found to\nbe reading below their grade level in the 1990s, and even in the twelfth grade\nthe proportion exceeded two-fifths. (The corresponding rates for white students\nwere 29 percent and 17 percent.) Even for those who regard AAVE as a genuine\nand inherently non-limiting variety of English, there still remains the problem of\nhow to deal with that variety in the classroom (see Smitherman, 1999). One\napproach is to attempt to eradicate AAVE and replace it with SE: AAVE may\nnot limit its users cognitively but it certainly limits them socially, and one of the\npurposes of education is the achievement of social equality. This is the tradi-\ntional attitude that educators have toward nonstandard dialects. (You do not\nhave to be a speaker of AAVE to experience this opinion of your speech, as\nany Cockney, Scouse, Geordie, or New Yorker knows who has been told his\nspeech sounds poor, slovenly, ugly, bad, or lazy!) But this approach has not\nbeen particularly effective. Great solidarity can be gained by effectively resisting\nacquisition of the standard variety; as we saw in chapter 7, Labov, Trudgill,\nCheshire, and others have amply documented such resistance. We should note\nthat among black youths in New York City the less standard the variety of\nEnglish spoken, the more successfully formal education appears to have been\nresisted, e.g., Labov\u2019s comments on the Jets reported in the previous section (see\np. 343). Likewise, some adolescents of Caribbean descent in cities like London\nare deliberately recreolizing (see p. 85) their speech as a solidarity marker when\nthey find they do not fit into the wider society.\nAn alternative approach has been called the approach through bidialectalism.\nSpeakers of AAVE should be taught to speak SE, but no attempt should be made\nto eradicate AAVE. Indeed, in the early stages of instruction AAVE itself should\nbe used as the language of instruction. For example, in recommending that\nreading materials written for black children should recognize the existence of\nAAVE, Stewart (1969, pp. 185\u20136) advocates the use of transitional materials.He\nsays that in the very first stage of reading, such children would meet a sentence\nlike \u2018Charles and Michael, they out playing.\u2019 Later, after they had learned to use\nthe copula, they would see \u2018Charles and Michael, they are out playing.\u2019 Finally,\nthey would meet the standard \u2018Charles and Michael are out playing.\u2019\nThis attempt to use transitional reading materials written in AAVE proved a\ncomplete failure. Those who advocated the use of such materials saw them as\nproviding a kind of bridge into readers written in SE. They argued that black\nchildren had enough problems when they entered school without facing the\nadditional barrier of learning to read from readers written in an alien dialect.\nThey could learn to read in their own dialect and make a later transition to\nbooks written in the standard. Blacks themselves led the opposition to such a\nmove, and teachers, parents, and black activists united to oppose it. (In England,\nmany parents of Caribbean descent have shown a similar resistance to any use\nof \u2018creole\u2019 in the classroom \u2013 see Sebba, 1997, pp. 78\u201383.) Their motives were\nvarious: some felt that such readers would disadvantage their children; others\ndenied the validity of the variety of language itself; still others resisted thenotion\nthat there should be any differences at all made in teaching white and black\nAITC14 348 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 349\nchildren; and still others insisted that the problem, if there was one, wasascribable\nto attitudes, i.e., was a problem of racism, and not a linguistic problem at all.\nRace and language were united, however, in two important incidents affecting\nthe schooling of blacks in the United States. The by-now famous \u2018Ann Arbor\nDecision\u2019 of 1979 is an example of a successful claim that AAVE is a bona fide\ndialect that schools must recognize. The parents of eleven African American\nchildren attending Martin Luther King School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, sued the\nschool board in federal court saying that their children had been denied the\n\u2018equal opportunity\u2019 to which they were entitled on account of the variety of\nEnglish they spoke. The judge in the case agreed and ordered the board to take\nappropriate action to teach the children to read. If that action required the\nschool system to recognize that the children did speak a different variety of the\nlanguage from that used elsewhere in the school system then the school system\nhad to adjust to the children and not the children to the school system.\nAlthough this was not quite a decision in favor of using both AAVE and SE, it\ndid give both legal and public recognition to AAVE as an issue that educators\ncould not shy away from.\nThe second decision involved Ebonics, a term particularly popular among\nthose who believe that there are strong connections between AAVE and African\nlanguages, specifically Niger-Congo languages (see Williams, 1975). On Decem-\nber 18, 1996, the Oakland School Board in California decided to recognize,\nmaintain, and use Ebonics in the classroom so that black children would even-\ntually acquire fluency in SE. In effect, the board declared Ebonics to be a\nseparate language from English, one moreover that was \u2018genetically based,\u2019\nwhatever that meant. This decision was supported by a unanimous vote of the\nLinguistic Society of America at its annual meeting on January 7, 1997, as being\n\u2018linguistically and pedagogically sound\u2019 without that organization giving any\nkind of endorsement to the idea that Ebonics was indeed \u2018genetically based.\u2019\nElsewhere it produced a very strong negative reaction (see Perry and Delpit,\n1998, Adger et al., 1999, Rickford, 1999a, 1999b, 2004, Lakoff, 2000, and\nBaugh, 2000). For example, it led to a United States Senate sub-committee\nhearing in January, 1997, and strong opposition from both prominent African\nAmericans (e.g., Jesse Jackson, until he changed his mind after taking time to\nreconsider the issues) and white conservatives (e.g., Rush Limbaugh). The result-\ning furore caused the board to drop the word Ebonics from its proposal in\nApril, 1997. If nonstandard varieties of English were to have a place in Oakland\nclassrooms, they would have to enter through the back door rather than the\nfront door. (There is now a considerable literature on Ebonics, little of which\nis very illuminating, for what is said is often just as confusing as the term itself,\nwhat happened in Oakland, and ideas about what people should do next time\nsomething similar happens.)\nMany linguists believe that language should not be an issue at all in educa-\ntion. They regard all varieties of a language as equal, so what we should be\ndoing is teaching everyone to be tolerant and accepting of other varieties (Trudgill,\n1995, pp. 186\u20137). This is a perhaps hopelessly utopian view. The inescapable\nreality is that people do use language as a discriminator in just about every sense\nof that word. Milroy and Milroy (1999) state that what actually happens is that\nAITC14 349 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 350 Disadvantage\nalthough public discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, and social class\nis not now publicly acceptable, it appears that discrimination on linguistic grounds\nis publicly acceptable, even though linguistic differences may themselves be\nassociated with ethnic, religious, and class differences. Varieties of a language do\nexist, and people do use these varieties for their own purposes, not all of them\nto be applauded. As linguists we may deplore this fact, but we would be naive\nto ignore it. It may not be something we can do anything about, for it may well\nbe the case that this is an inevitable use people make of language, and in that\nsense some kind of linguistic (or social) universal.\nFairclough (1995) goes even further in his criticism of any kind of live-and-\nlet-live solution. He criticizes the \u2018language awareness\u2019 approach advocated in\nvarious government reports in England in which students are taught SE but\nasked to recognize the legitimacy of other varieties for certain purposes. He\nsays (p. 225) that this is a doubtful bit of \u2018social engineering,\u2019 that \u2018passing on\nprestigious practices and values such as those of standard English without de-\nveloping a critical awareness of them...implicitly legitim[izes] them,\u2019 that it\n\u2018dress[es] up inequality as diversity.\u2019 Moreover, \u2018attributing the stigmatization of\nvarieties to individual prejudice papers over the systematic, social legitimized\nstigmatization of varieties.\u2019 It does so because \u2018it puts linguistics...in the posi-\ntion of helping to normalize and legitimize a politically partisan representation,\nand turns a social scientific discipline into a resource for hegemonic struggle\u2019\n(p. 250). In Fairclough\u2019s view, when linguists say that they should not take sides,\nthey are actually taking sides, having been ideologically co-opted \u2013 though\nunwittingly \u2013 into the struggle about language and power in society.\nI have said that there may be a certain solidarity to be found in the use of\nAAVE and also that Bernstein has argued that the characteristic language of the\nlower working class successfully perpetuates itself. In neither case are the users\nof these two varieties unfamiliar with SE. Nor are they unaware that SE has a\nprestige which their variety lacks. It is quite easy to document such familiarity\nand awareness. For example, some of the studies reported in chapter 7 clearly\nindicate that speakers know that certain varieties are preferred but they do not\nnecessarily choose to use these varieties. One 15-year-old Glasgow boy had this\nto say on that subject to Macaulay (1977): \u2018I don\u2019t think I would change the\nway I speak. I wouldn\u2019t like to have an English accent. I think it\u2019s a very daft\none. They pronounce words correctly but they don\u2019t sound very nice. In your\nown environment you\u2019d feel out of place. If you live in Glasgow you must talk\nlike a Glaswegian.\u2019\nA number of other studies have clearly demonstrated that adolescents and\neven very young children are quite aware of language differences and some of\nthe consequences of such differences. Giles and Powesland (1975, p. 102) report\non one study in which an investigator who could speak in either a Birmingham\naccent or RP spoke to two groups of 17-year-olds about psychology, using one\naccent with one group and the other with the other. When the students were\nasked certain questions after the two talks, it was apparent that the investigator\nwas rated higher in his RP guise so far as his intelligence was concerned. Moreover,\nstudents wrote more to him and about him in this guise than in his Birmingham\nguise. Apparently, even though many students themselves do not use an RPaccent,\nAITC14 350 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 351\nand may say they do not like it, they are still willing to ascribe certain virtuesto\nthose who speak it, whether or not these are deserved, as this use of the matched-\nguise technique (see pp. 112\u201313) effectively demonstrates. RP speakers are judged\nmore competent, intelligent, and industrious, but non-RP speakers are judged to\nhave greater personal integrity, to be better-humored, and to be more socially\nattractive.\nIn still another study the same investigators (p. 31) found that, although\n12-year-olds knew which accents have social prestige and which accents lacksuch\nprestige, they tend not to judge their own accents reliably, many considering that\nthey use an RP accent when in fact they actually use a strong local accent. Such\nstudies may have interesting consequences for those who attempt to matchteachers\nand pupils, for it is quite likely that the various possible mixes of RP and local\naccents, and standard and local varieties, will produce differential results as\nteachers and students view each other differently and react accordingly.\nPerhaps the most interesting study of all is Rosenthal\u2019s study (1974) of atti-\ntudes toward two kinds of speech using 136 schoolchildren between the ages\nof 3 and 6, ninety upper-class white children and the rest lower-class black\nchildren. Each child saw two identical cardboard boxes, and each box contained\na cassette-tape recorder and a present hidden from the child\u2019s view. Each box\nrepresented a \u2018head,\u2019 and the \u2018voice\u2019 in each head described the present in the\nbox. One voice spoke AAVE and the other SE. Each child was asked to choose\nwhich of the two presents he or she preferred and to answer certain questions.\nAsked which voice spoke better, 79 percent of the children chose the speaker\nwith the standard voice, and 73 percent said they expected a better present from\nthe box that contained this voice. So far as accent was concerned, 92 percent\nof the white children identified one voice as belonging to a black person and 72\npercent the other as belonging to a white person. The corresponding percentages\nfor the black children\u2019s identifications were 73 and 59 percent. Black children\nsaid they liked the AAVE voice more than the other and almost half (46 percent)\nopted to take the present from its box. This study clearly shows that even very\nyoung children have learned that people speak differently and that such differ-\nences have social consequences.\nChildren very quickly learn to associate certain types of speech with race,\nclass, gender, and so on. Reviewing work on language disadvantage done dur-\ning the 1980s, Edwards (1989, p. 149) reports that \u2018Recent studies of language\nattitudes indicate that problems associated with speech perceptions and speech\nstereotyping continue.\u2019 He adds that nonstandard varieties continue to be dis-\nfavored, even by those who use them. His conclusion (p. 151) is that\nwhile the logical course of action, given unfavourable attitudes to certain varieties,\nis to alter the attitudes, this is at best a long-term strategy and, at worst simply\nutopian. Besides, social needs quite reasonably dictate a common standard which,\nwhile not the maternal variety of everyone, can at least be presented to all through\neducation, particularly in the more formal domains of reading and writing.\nIt was just such a view that was behind the British government\u2019s \u2018Better English\u2019\ncampaign of 1995 designed to improve spoken English: there was to be a war\non \u2018communication by grunt,\u2019 i.e., nonstandard English.\nAITC14 351 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 352 Disadvantage\nIt is the social consequences of the use of nonstandard English and the need\nfor a common standard that Honey (1983, 1989, 1997) has tried to address. In\nHoney\u2019s view, the schools would be doing a disservice to students if they did not\nteach SE. For Honey, all varieties of English are not equal because people do not\nview them as equal. (Honey himself does not believe that all varieties of the\nlanguage are equal. He is quite sure that SE and RP are the \u2018best.\u2019) He says\n(1989, p. 174):\nThere is a simplistic argument which says that rather than requiring the child to\nadapt to society, we should change society to accommodate the characteristics of\nthe child. Those who use this argument to deny children access to any awareness\nof the implications of speaking with one accent rather than another are doing them\nan obvious disservice, if they cannot also guarantee that society\u2019s attitudes will\nhave changed in time for that generation of children to benefit.\nIn Honey\u2019s view, schools should provide students with advantages. One of these\nis to be \u2018well-spoken,\u2019 well-spokenness being \u2018an attribute of human dignity\u2019\n(p. 176). Finally, he adds (p. 177) that, \u2018Whether we like it or not, the abilityto\nhandle one of the most widely acceptable accents [presumably RP] has become\nan important indicator of an individual\u2019s ability to control the world around\nhim.\u2019 Discussing SE, he says (1997, p. 42) that \u2018causing children to learnstandard\nEnglish is an act of empowerment which will give them access to a whole world\nof knowledge and to an assurance of greater authority in their dealings with the\nworld outside their own homes, in a way which is genuinely liberating.\u2019 Honey\u2019s\nviews have not been popular among sociolinguists because they feel that many\nof his statements misrepresent the positions linguists hold, or lack any evidence\nto support them, or are just plain wrong. However, they do appeal to those who\nseek simple solutions to complex problems.\nThe advantages of adopting styles of speech associated with the middle class\nand giving up those of the working class often seem to teachers to be too\nobvious to be questioned. They seem directly related to social mobility, which\nis a \u2018good thing.\u2019 Many teachers have actually gone through this process, at least\nto some extent, themselves. However, for many working-class children, perhaps\na large majority, the advantages are not at all obvious. Many see no advantage\nto buying what the educational system is trying to sell because they find no\nvalue in what is being sold: only promises too often broken. As we saw earlier\n(chapter 7), many members of the working class, including children, find much\nto be gained from hanging on to their language and resisting attempts that\nothers make to change it. They find solidarity in working-class speech. The\nprestige it has may be negative and covert, but it is not without its comforts.\nMoreover, they may be quite aware of what it means to change: almost certain\nalienation from their peers without necessarily acceptance by social superiors.\nAttempting to \u2018speak posh\u2019 in Newcastle or Liverpool is almost certain to bring\nabout your social isolation if you attend a local state school. Eckert\u2019s work\n(1989) with jocks and burnouts (see p. 212) clearly shows how important\nidentifying with the local area is for the latter group. In London, Sebba (1993,\np. 33) found that London Jamaican was \u2018a sign of ethnic identity and solidarity,\nAITC14 352 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 353\nand [provided] an in-group language for adolescents.\u2019 An instructive account of\nsome of the pressures and consequences of making any such change is contained\nin Hoggart\u2019s account (1970) of moving from a working-class childhood to a\nmiddle-class, intellectually oriented adulthood. All that may happen fromteachers\u2019\nexhortations to children to adopt a \u2018better\u2019 variety of language is an increase in\nany linguistic insecurity the children have. The consequences may therefore be\nquite negative for many children.\nWhile linguists may try to offer what they regard as correctives to views asso-\nciated with Bernstein and to false and misleading statements about the language\nabilities of many blacks in the United States, they may not necessarily be able\nto provide any solutions to these problems. For example, Alim (2005) describes\nhow difficult it is to deal with the issue of teaching standard English to black\nyouths in Haven High, a high school in a small American city in which oppor-\ntunities for blacks are constantly decreasing. Teachers have a poor knowledge\nof the language of black youths and do not understand why they resist \u2018white\ncultural and linguistic norming\u2019 (p. 195), what Alim calls attempts to \u2018gentrify\u2019\ntheir language. His view is that some kind of balance must be found between\nthe two language varieties; however, he offers no suggestions as to how such a\nbalance might possibly be achieved. Perhaps that is not surprising since the\nproblem has proved to be intractable everywhere it has been identified.\nWe must take seriously certain observations by Goody and Watt (1972), who\nwarn against ignoring the oral transmission of knowledge and all that goes with\nsuch transmission. They say (pp. 342\u20133):\nIf...we return to the reasons for the relative failure of universal compulsory\neducation to bring about the intellectual, social, and political results that James\nMill expected, we may well lay a major part of the blame on the gap between the\npublic literate tradition of the school, and the very different and indeed often\ndirectly contradictory private oral traditions of the pupil\u2019s family and peer group...\nthere seem to be factors in the very nature of literate methods which make them\nill-suited to bridge the gap between the street-corner society and the blackboard\njungle....In a literate society...the mere fact that reading and writing are nor-\nmally solitary activities means that, in so far as the dominant cultural tradition is\na literate one, it is very easy to avoid....and even when it is not avoided its actual\neffects may be relatively shallow. Not only because, as Plato argued, the effects of\nreading are intrinsically less deep and permanent than those of oral converse; but\nalso because the abstractness of the syllogism and of the Aristotelian categoriza-\ntions of knowledge do not correspond very directly with common experience. The\nabstractness of the syllogism, for example, of its very nature disregards the indi-\nvidual\u2019s social experience and immediate personal context; and the compartmentaliza-\ntion of knowledge similarly restricts the kind of connections which the individual\ncan establish and ratify with the natural and social world. The essential way of\nthinking of the specialist in literate culture is fundamentally at odds with that of\ndaily life and common experience; and the conflict is embodied in the long tradi-\ntion of jokes about absent-minded professors.\nSuch a view of education places both AAVE and Bernstein\u2019s views concerning\nthe linguistic socialization of children into a much broader framework than the\none within which linguists usually work. We should also remind ourselves that\nAITC14 353 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 354 Disadvantage\nthe problems that educators must deal with in their work are extremely com-\nplex, and, while linguists may make a contribution toward solving some of these\nproblems, that contribution may not be a particularly large one. Language is but\none factor among many that we must consider when we try to solve pressing\nsocial problems. A total solution must take other factors into account too.\nLinguists must be prepared to recognize that fact.\nDiscussion\n1. As we saw in the previous section, there are at least three quite differentviews\nof the relationship between AAVE and SE: (1) AAVE is a dialect (probably\nbest considered a nonstandard one rather than a regional one) of SE; (2)\nAAVE is a creolized variety of English and its speakers use it in a creole\ncontinuum; and (3) AAVE is a variety of English related systematically toall\nother varieties of English. What do you see as the educational consequences\nof each of these views?\n2. How would you propose to deal with each of the following in the\nclassroom:\na. AAVE in Detroit?\nb. West Indian Creole in London?\nc. South Asian (i.e., Indian) English in Toronto?\nd. Scouse in Liverpool?\nWhat kinds of factors would be important to you in your decision-making?\n3. \u2018People often say one thing but do another\u2019 is an observation that is not\ninfrequently made about human behavior. How might such an observation\napply to the linguistic beliefs and practices of children, parents, members of\ndifferent social classes and ethnic groups, and teachers? What are some of\nthose beliefs and practices?\n4. Goody and Watt (1972, p. 353) comment on the persistence of the oral\ntradition in Western civilization as follows:\nin our civilization, writing is clearly an addition, not an alternative, to oral\ntransmission. Even in our Buch und Lesen culture, childrearing and a multi-\ntude of other forms of activity both within and outside the family depend\nupon speech; and the relationship between the written and the oral traditions\nmust be regarded as a major problem in Western cultures.\nIf their claim is correct, what implications do you find in it for language\neducation?\n5. Stubbs (1980, p. 156) makes the following observation concerning the work\nof Bernstein and Labov: \u2018The two bodies of work are...not directly com-\nparable in terms of either data or theory.\u2019 To what extent do Bernsteinand\nLabov seem to address the same issues? To the extent that they do addressthe\nsame issues, who seems to make the greater contribution to understanding?\nAITC14 354 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Disadvantage 355\nTo the extent that they address different issues, who seems to have more to\nsay to linguists, sociolinguists, and educators?\n6. Sociolinguists sometimes appear as \u2018expert witnesses\u2019 in cases before the\ncourts. Try to find some examples of their testimony. Why was it helpful\/\nunhelpful, accepted\/disregarded?\nFurther Reading\nFor a brief overview of the topics dealt with here, see Edwards (1994).

Such\nchanges are usually described as instances of language planning. According to\nWeinstein (1980, p. 56), \u2018Language planning is a government authorized, longterm,\nsustained, and conscious effort to alter a language\u2019s function in a society for the\npurpose of solving communication problems.\u2019 It may involve assessing resources,\ncomplex decision-making, the assignment of different functions to different lan-\nguages or varieties of a language in a community, and the commitment ofvaluable\nresources. As we will see, language planning can take a variety of forms and\nproduce many different kinds of results. It is also not without its controversies.\nLanguage planning has become part of modern nation-building because a\nnoticeable trend in the modern world is to make language and nation synonym-\nous. Deutsch (1968) has documented the tremendous increase within Europe\nduring the last thousand years in what he calls \u2018full-fledged national languages.\u2019\nA millennium ago these numbered six: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Anglo-\nSaxon (i.e., Old English), and Church Slavonic. By 1250 this number had in-\ncreased to seventeen, a number that remained fairly stable until the beginning\nof the nineteenth century with, of course, changes in the actual languages, as\nHebrew, Arabic, Low German, Catalan, and Norwegian either were submerged\nor became inactive, and languages like English, Dutch, Polish, Magyar, and\nTurkish replaced them in the inventory. In the nineteenth century the total\nnumber of fully fledged national languages increased to thirty. According to\nDeutsch, it showed a further increase to fifty-three by 1937, and it has further\nincreased since then. Each \u2018new\u2019 country wanted its own language, and language\nbecame a basic expression of nationalistic feeling, as we see in such examples\nas Finnish, Welsh, Norwegian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Irish, Breton,\nBasque, Georgian, and Hebrew. Consequently, governments have had to plan\nto develop or promote certain languages and sometimes to hinder or demote\nothers, and a demand for \u2018language rights\u2019 is often one of the first demands\nmade by a discontented minority almost anywhere in the world.\nI will discuss some of the ideas that have gone into planning efforts made on\nbehalf of some of these languages and, in doing so, mention briefly whatplanning\nhas meant for certain other languages. I will also comment on the \u2018global\u2019\nnature of English at the beginning of the third millennium.\nAITC15 356 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 357\nIssues\nLanguage planning is an attempt to interfere deliberately with a language or one\nof its varieties: it is human intervention into natural processes of language\nchange, diffusion, and erosion. That attempt may focus on either its status with\nregard to some other language or variety or its internal condition with a view\nto changing that condition, or on both of these since they are not mutually\nexclusive. The first focus results in status planning; the second results in corpus\nplanning.\nStatus planning changes the function of a language or a variety of a language\nand the rights of those who use it. For example, when speakers of a minority\nlanguage are denied the use of that language in educating their children, their\nlanguage has no status. Alternatively, when a government declares that hence-\nforth two languages rather than one of these alone will be officially recognizedin\nall functions, the newly recognized one has gained status. Status itself is a rela-\ntive concept; it may also be improved or reduced by degrees, and usually is.\nSo far as languages and their varieties are concerned, status changes are nearly\nalways very slow, are sometimes actively contested, and often leave strong\nresidual feelings. Even relatively minor changes or proposals for changes can\nproduce such effects, as the residents of many countries, e.g., Norway, Belgium,\nCanada, and India, are well aware.\nCorpus planning seeks to develop a variety of a language or a language,\nusually to standardize it, that is, to provide it with the means for serving every\npossible language function in society (see Clyne, 1997, for a collection of recent\npapers). Consequently, corpus planning may involve such matters as the devel-\nopment of an orthography, new sources of vocabulary, dictionaries, and a liter-\nature, together with the deliberate cultivation of new uses so that the language\nmay extend its use into such areas as government, education, and trade. Corpus\nplanning has been particularly important in countries like Indonesia, Israel,\nFinland, India, Pakistan, and Papua New Guinea. These two types of planning\noften co-occur, for many planning decisions involve some combination of a\nchange in status with internal change. As one particular language in Papua New\nGuinea is developed, all other languages are affected, whether or not the effects\nare recognized officially. We must also note then that, just as planning may\neither be deliberate or proceed somewhat haphazardly, even accidentally, so its\nresults may be deliberately intended or not at all as intended. Even though it is\npossible to recognize most of the relevant parameters, language planning is still\nfar from being any kind of exact science. Linguists have also been quite involved\nin many planning activities and surrounding controversies. A few take another\nposition, e.g., Calvet, 1998, maintaining that all such activities, since they are\nprescriptive in nature, necessarily conflict with the basic tenets of linguistics,\nwhich is essentially descriptive in its focus.\nCobarrubias (1983) has described four typical ideologies that may motivate\nactual decision-making in language planning in a particular society: these are\nlinguistic assimilation, linguistic pluralism, vernacularization, andinternationalism.\nAITC15 357 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 358 Planning\nLinguistic assimilation is the belief that everyone, regardless of origin, should\nlearn the dominant language of the society. Examples are easy to find. France\napplied this policy to various peoples within its borders. The United States also\napplied the policy both internally to immigrants and externally in a possession,\nGuam, where Chamorro was suppressed until 1973, and in the Philippines,\nwhere instruction in the schools had to be in English throughout the period in\nwhich the United States ruled that country; a similar assimilationist ideology\nprevailed in Puerto Rico until the 1940s. Linguistic assimilation is practiced\nwidely and in a wide variety of forms, e.g., policies of Hellenization of Macedo-\nnian in Greece and of Russification in the former Soviet Union.\nLinguistic pluralism, the recognition of more than one language, also takes a\nvariety of forms. It can be territorially based or individually based or there may\nbe some combination of the two. It can be complete or partial, so that all or\nonly some aspects of life can be conducted in more than one language in a\nsociety. Examples are countries like Belgium, Canada, Singapore, South Africa,and\nSwitzerland. Vernacularization is the restoration or elaboration of an indigenous\nlanguage and its adoption as an official language, e.g., Bahasa Indonesia in\nIndonesia; Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea; Hebrew in Israel; Tagalog (renamed\nFilipino) in the Philippines; and Quechua in Peru.\nInternationalization is the adoption of a non-indigenous language of wider\ncommunication either as an official language or for such purposes as educa-\ntion or trade, e.g., English in Singapore, India, the Philippines, and Papua New\nGuinea. The languages that have been most internationalized in this sense are\nEnglish and French with English much more so than French. (Currently France\nis seeking to develop La Francophonie as an organization to further French in\nthe world.) I will have more to say about English later in this chapter.\nAs a result of planning decisions, a language can achieve one of a variety of\nstatuses (Kloss, 1968). A language may be recognized as the sole official lan-\nguage, as French is in France or English in the United Kingdom and the United\nStates. This fact does not necessarily mean that the status must be recognized\nconstitutionally or by statute; it may be a matter of long-standing practice, as\nit is with English in the two cases cited above. Two or more languages may\nshare official status in some countries, e.g., English and French in Canada and\nin Cameroon; French and Flemish in Belgium; French, German, Italian, and\nRomansh (even though the latter has very few speakers and is actually only a\n\u2018national\u2019 language) in Switzerland; English and Afrikaans in South Africa; and\nEnglish, Malay, Tamil, and Chinese in Singapore, although in this case Malay\nhas an additional \u2018national-language\u2019 status.\nA language may also have official status but only on a regional basis, e.g.,Igbo,\nYoruba, and Hausa in Nigeria; German in Belgium; and Marathi in Maharashtra,\nIndia. A language may be a \u2018promoted\u2019 language, lacking official status, butused\nby various authorities for specific purposes, e.g., many languages in Canada. A\ntolerated language is one that is neither promoted nor proscribed or restricted,\ne.g., Basque in France, many immigrant languages in western Europe, and\nAmerindian languages in North America. Finally, a discouraged or proscribed\nlanguage is one against which there are official sanctions or restrictions, e.g.,\nBasque in the early years of Franco\u2019s regime in Spain; Scots Gaelic after the\nAITC15 358 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 359\n1745 rising; Macedonian in Greece; until recently many immigrant and native\nlanguages in areas like North America and Australia, particularly in schools for\nthe children of such people; and the Norman French patois of the Channel\nIslands during the German occupation in World War II. Kurdish is today largely\nproscribed in Turkey. The language cannot be used for writing anything, but\nsince 1991 it can be used in speaking and singing!\nPlanning decisions will obviously play a very large role in determining what\nhappens to any minority language or languages in a country (Cobarrubias,\n1983, pp. 71\u20133). They can result in deliberate attempts to eradicate such a\nlanguage, as with Franco\u2019s attempt to eliminate Basque from Spain by banning\nthat language from public life. Official neglect may result in letting minority\nlanguages die by simply not doing anything to keep them alive. This has been\nthe fate of many Amerindian languages and is likely to be the fate of many\nmore. In France Basque was neglected; in Spain it was virtually proscribed. One\ninteresting consequence is that, while once there were more speakers of Basque\nin France than in Spain, now the situation is reversed. Instead of neglect there\nmay be a level of tolerance, so that if a community with a minority language\nwishes to keep that language alive, it is allowed to do so but at its own expense.\nIn 1988 the Council of Europe adopted a Charter on Regional or Minority\nlanguages that gave some recognition to such languages but really allowed each\ncountry to do as it pleased with them.\nTwo other issues are worthy of comment. The first has to do with what lan-\nguage rights immigrants to a country should have in an era of widespread\nimmigration motivated by a variety of concerns but within a system of states\nwhich often equates statehood or nationhood with language and sometimes\nwith ethnicity. It is not surprising, therefore, that what language rights immi-\ngrants should have is a controversial issue almost everywhere. One view is that\nimmigrants give up their rights to their languages and their cultures bymigrating.\nThe opposite view is that no one should be required to give up a mother tongue\nby reason of such movement, and that this is particularly regrettable in a world\nin which population movement is either encouraged, e.g., nineteenth-century\nmigration to the Americas, or enforced, e.g., by persecutions. Both UNESCO\nand the United Nations have declared that ethnic groups have the right to\nmaintain their languages. However, it is not at all clear that immigrants to\ncountries like the United States, Canada, and Australia, or the families of Euro-\npean \u2018guest workers\u2019 are covered by such declarations. Indigenous populations\nclearly are, but there may be disagreement as to what constitutes an indigenous\ngroup, as various people have learned, sometimes fatally, in places like the\nformer Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Burundi, and Sri Lanka to cite but a few\nexamples.\nThe second issue concerns the problem of identifying the right kinds of datathat\nmust go into planning decisions. Planning must be based on good information,\nbut sometimes the kinds of information that go into planning decisions are not\nvery reliable. Census-takers, for example, may have considerable difficulty in\ndetermining just who speaks what languages when and for what purposes. The\ncensus of India has always had this problem. The issues are complex, andgatherers\nof such information may have great difficulty in getting answers even to simple\nAITC15 359 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 360 Planning\nquestions. You also get different answers according to the way you phrase your\nquestions. What is your mother tongue? What was the first language you learned?\nWhat languages do you speak? What language do you speak at home? What\nlanguages are you fluent in? Do you speak Spanish (French) (German)? And so\non. Moreover, the questions and how they are answered may be politically\nmotivated. The different answers are also subject to a variety of interpretations.\nFurthermore, it is easier to elicit particular kinds of information at certain\ntimes than at other times. During World War II many people in North America\napparently suppressed information concerning either a German ethnicity or any\nability to speak German. By the 1960s and 1970s the ability to speak Spanish\nwas something to be proud of in the United States, just as was the ability to\nspeak French in Canada. Recent Canadian censuses show more and more people\nclaiming bilingual ability in English and French, but little assessment is made of\nsuch self-reported claims; it is apparently enough that people should wish to\nmake them! Consequently, we must always exercise caution in interpreting\nuntreated data from censuses.\nQuestions asked at ten-year periods may also produce different answers, partly\nbecause there have been objective quantifiable changes but also because less\nquantifiable and more subjective psychological changes have occurred. A par-\nticularly telling example is the so-called \u2018re-discovery\u2019 of ethnicity in the United\nStates in the late twentieth century. We must remember that we cannot ignore\nthe feelings that people have about who they are, what they speak, and what\nrights they should have. Such feelings are real. For example, as mentioned\nearlier, speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin insist they speak the same language\neven though linguists deny that they do; such a feeling of \u2018sameness\u2019 is every bit\nas important in language planning as is the linguists\u2019 fact of \u2018difference.\u2019\nDiscussion\n1. Refer back to pp. 358\u20139 to the examples given of languages whichmay\nbe described as official, joint official, regional official, promoted, tolerated,\nand proscribed. Find further examples for as many of these categories as\nyou can.\n2. Some people are minorities everywhere so far as language is concerned, e.g.,\nBasques, Lapps, Kurds, and most aboriginal peoples. What linguistic \u2018rights\u2019\ndo you consider such minorities to possess?\n3. Can you find any instances in your own community of languages that enjoy\ndifferent statuses? That is, how many different languages do you come\nacross, and how must, or how do, those in authority deal with people who\nuse these languages?\n4. The Maori language of New Zealand has been described as an endangered\nlanguage. Virtually every Maori speaks English, and, while many young\nMaori are bilingual, an increasing number do not speak any Maori at all.\nIn fact, Maori is used as an everyday language only in some rural areas.\nEducation is conducted in English, English is the language of towns and\ncities in which the Maori increasingly prefer to live, and Maori itself is\nAITC15 360 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 361\nused more and more only by older speakers on ceremonial occasions, with\nattempts to teach it as a subject in many secondary schools so far showing\nfew signs of success. Do you know of any situations which appear to be\nanalogous to the situation with the Maori? How would you plan to pre-\nserve Maori language and culture?\n5. Gaelic was not allowed to be taught in Scottish schools until 1918, and then\nonly as a subject of instruction. It took a further forty years for it to become\nused as a language of instruction. The Welsh gained the same right to use\nWelsh as a language of instruction only in 1953. Some would argue that\n\u2018progress\u2019 has been made; others, \u2018regress.\u2019 Why are there such conflicting\nviews?\n6. There are different kinds of migrants in the modern world, e.g., perman-\nent \u2018voluntary\u2019 migrants, \u2018guest workers,\u2019 refugees, and temporary residents.\nHow are the language rights, if any, of such people viewed in different\ncountries?\nA Variety of Situations\nIn this section we will look at a variety of linguistic situations in the world\nto see some instances of planning. In the following section we will look at a\nnumber of countries chosen because they show some of the variety of issues\nthat states engaged in planning face as they continue to make changes. Many\nother examples could be cited; I have chosen these to illustrate certain points.\nDoubtless other examples would have served just as well, for it is probably\ntrue to say that nowhere in the world can you find a country where nothing is\nbeing done, either directly or by default, concerning the language or languages\nof that country.\nFrance serves as a good example of a country which has a single national\nlanguage and does little or nothing for any other language. Most inhabitants\nsimply assume that French is rightly the language of France. Consequently they\nvirtually ignore other languages so that there is little national interest in any\nmove to try to ascertain exactly how many people speak Proven\u00e7al or Breton\nor to do anything for, or against, Basque. Likewise, if an immigrant group to\nFrance, e.g., Algerians or Vietnamese, wants to try to preserve its language, it\nmust try to do so in its own time and with its own resources, for it is widely\nassumed that French is the proper language of instruction in schools in France.\n(The only major exception is that German is taught in Alsace.) This situation\nis little different from the one that existed in the old colonial days, in which it\nwas assumed that the French language and the curriculum of Metropolitan\nFrance were entirely appropriate in the lyc\u00e9es of colonies such as Algeria and\nIndo-China (now Vietnam) attended by the more fortunate local children, who\nmight then aspire to higher education in France. France is a highly centralized\ncountry with Paris its dominant center even to the extent that when traveling\nin France you often see signposts indicating exactly how far you are from Paris\nAITC15 361 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 362 Planning\n(actually from the cathedral of Notre Dame, its symbolic center). It has been so\nsince the time of Richelieu. France and the French language are inseparable.\nRegional languages such as Breton, Basque, Occitan, Flemish, Catalan,Corsican,\nand Franco-Proven\u00e7al persist, get varying amounts of state support, and provide\nlocal identities to those who maintain them. Such languages may be tolerated\nbut they cannot be allowed to threaten a state unified around French. TheFrench,\nof course, are not alone in seeing their country as essentially a monolingual one;\nthe English just across the Channel and the Japanese right across the world are\nlike them in this respect.\nAdjacent to France we have in one direction the multilingualism of Switzer-\nland and in another the bilingualism of Belgium, but it is the second of these\nto which I will refer. Today, French and Flemish (Dutch) coexist in a somewhat\nuneasy truce in Belgium. The struggle between the French and Flemish in that\ncountry has a long history. In 1815 the politically and socially ascendant French\nin Belgium found themselves returned at the end of the Napoleonic Wars to\nDutch rule. William of Holland proceeded to promote Dutch interests and\nlanguage and limit the power of the French, the Walloons. He was also a strong\nCalvinist, and in 1830 both Flemish and Walloon Catholics rebelled and gained\nindependence for Belgium. However, this religious unity between the Flemish\nCatholics and the Walloon Catholics soon gave way to cleavage along linguistic\nlines, language proving in this case to be a stronger force for divisiveness than\nreligion for cohesion. The new state became French-oriented and Flemish was\nbanned from the government, law, army, universities, and secondary schools.\nFrench domination was everywhere, and it was not until the twentieth century\nthat the Flemish, who are actually a majority of the population, were able to\ngain a measure of linguistic and social equality. Today\u2019s equality, however, is still\ncolored by memories of past discrimination based on language. The Belgians\nhave tried to settle their differences by separating the languages on a territorial\nbasis and regarding Brussels as a bilingual city, even though it is clearly French-\ndominant. Periodically, however, linguistic differences surface in Belgium to create\ntensions between the Walloons and the Flemish, just as they do, as we will see,\nin Canada.\nIn Spain the recent revival of Catalan is of interest. The Catalans have had\na long and proud history, traditionally regarding themselves as more prosperous\nand progressive than the Castilians and constantly having to assert themselves\nto see that they were not exploited, e.g., by revolts in 1640 and 1705, and\nthrough expressing their displeasure with the mismanagement that led to the\nloss of Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century. But Catalan, a language\nwhich resembles French as much as it does Spanish, itself was a dying language\nby the end of the nineteenth century, spoken monolingually only in the villages\nand giving way to Castilian even in Barcelona. However, a group of intellectuals\nand poets succeeded in reviving the language in the early twentieth century in\nconjunction with a movement to promote Catalan nationalism. When this\nmovement failed in 1923, an era of repression began, which led to a further\nreform movement culminating in the founding of the Republic of Spain and its\nconsequence, the Spanish Civil War. Catalonia suffered dreadfully during that\nwar. One of the war\u2019s results was, again, the suppression of Catalan, and this\nAITC15 362 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 363\nwas not effectively ended until after Franco\u2019s death and the restoration of a\ndemocratic system of government. As a result of the decrees of King Juan\nCarlos, it is now once more possible to worship in Catalan, to be educated in\nCatalan, and to use the language freely without being suspected of disloyalty.\nSimilar rights were given to the Basques, another linguistically persecuted group\nin Spain during Franco\u2019s time. Catalan has once more achieved a considerable\namount of the status it once enjoyed in the Spanish peninsula, and Basque now\nenjoys a measure of status long denied to it. There is even some evidence of a\nkind of backlash against any kind of exclusivity for Catalan in Catalonia.\nO\u2019Donnell (1996) reports that many Catalonians fear recent changes may have\ngone a bit too far: they are happy to be able to use Catalan without restriction\nbut they also want to retain their Castilian-language ability and its widerSpanish\nconnection.\nTurkey provides a good example of very deliberate language planningdesigned\nto achieve certain national objectives and to do this very quickly. When Kemal\nAtat\u00fcrk (ata \u2018father\u2019), the \u2018father of the Turks,\u2019 established the modern republic\nof Turkey, he was confronted with the task of modernizing the language. It had\nno vocabulary for modern science and technology, was written in an unsuitable\nArabic orthography, and was strongly influenced by both Arabic and Persian.\nIn 1928 Atat\u00fcrk deliberately adopted the Roman script for his new modern\nTurkish. This effectively cut the Turks off from their Islamic past and directed\ntheir attention toward both their Turkish roots and their future as Turks in a\nmodern world. Since only 10 percent of the population was literate, there was\nno mass objection to the changes. It was possible to use the new script almost\nimmediately in steps taken to increase the amount of literacy in the country.\nIn the 1930s Atat\u00fcrk promoted a further move away from Arabic and Persian\nin the development of the new vocabulary that the language required in order\nto meet the needs of science and technology. The \u2018Sun Language Theory\u2019 was\ndeveloped, a theory which said that Turkish was the mother tongue of the world\nand that, when Turkish borrowed from other languages, it was really takingback\nwhat had originally been Turkish anyway. Some deliberate attempts were made\nto purify the language, but these were not very successful, and today Turkish\nis full of borrowings, particularly from English, French, and other European\nlanguages. Corpus planning was very effective for a while in bringing about a\nmodernizing, secular-oriented Turkey. However, it stagnated in the last decades\nof the twentieth century as problems arose with defining a new Turkish identity:\nsecular or religious, European or Asian, Western or Islamic. (See Lewis, 1999,\nand Dokan\u00e7ay-Aktuna, 2004, together with the rest of that issue of the Inter-\nnational Journal of the Sociology of Language for assessments of recent devel-\nopments.)\nIn the former Soviet Union there was a great amount of language planning\ndating from its very founding, though not all of it was coherent or consistent.\nOne of the most important policies was Russification. Needless to say, in a state\nas vast as the Soviet Union, composed of approximately 100 different nation-\nalities, each with its own language or variety of a language, there were several\ndifferent aspects to such a policy. One of these was the elevation of regional and\nlocal dialects into \u2018languages,\u2019 a policy of \u2018divide and rule.\u2019 Its goal was to\nAITC15 363 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 364 Planning\nprevent the formation of large language blocks and also allow the central gov-\nernment to insist that Russian be used as a lingua franca. It also led to the large\nnumber of languages that flourished in the Soviet Union.\nIn addition, the Cyrillic script was extended to nearly all the languages of the\nSoviet Union. This orthography further helped to cut off the Muslim peoples of\ncentral Asia from contact with Arabic, Turkish, and Persian influences. In the\n1930s these people were actually provided with Romanized scripts, but Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s\nRomanization of Turkish posed a threat in that it made the Turkish world\naccessible to the Soviet peoples of central Asia. Consequently, Romanizationwas\nabandoned in 1940, Cyrillic alphabets were reimposed, and deliberate attempts\nwere made to stress as many differences as possible among the variouslanguages\nof the area (e.g., by developing special Cyrillic characters for local pronuncia-\ntions) as part of the policy of divide and rule. Russification also required the\nlocal languages of the Soviet Union to borrow words from Russian when new\nwords were needed. Population migrations, not necessarily voluntary, also spread\nRussian (and Russians) throughout the country as a whole, e.g., into Kazakhstan\nwhere Kazakhs became a minority, and into the Baltic republics, particularly\nLatvia and Estonia.\nWhile many local and regional languages were actively encouraged in the\nSoviet Union, so that Russian itself could be legitimized as a lingua franca, a\nnumber of languages were banned from support, e.g., Arabic, Hebrew, and\nGerman, since it was not deemed to be in the interests of the state to support\nthese. Russian was also promoted as a universal second language and as a lan-\nguage of instruction in the schools. However, there was resistance in such areas\nas Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Baltic republics.\nWhen the Soviet Union eventually fell into disarray at the end of the 1980s\nsuch policies had interesting consequences. The Soviet Union had been organ-\nized internally by republics constructed primarily on language and ethnicity. It\nproceeded to divide that way. For example, Ukraine, even though the language\nitself and the people had been heavily Russified, became a separate state. The\nBaltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania went their ways too. Moldavia\nbecame Moldova and its Moldavian language was finally acknowledged to be\nwhat it was, Romanian, and was renamed Moldavian\u2013Romanian. Georgia,\nArmenia, and Kazakhstan separated too and proclaimed Georgian, Armenian,\nand Kazakh as their national languages, even though in the last case only\n40 percent of the population were Kazakhs and 37 percent were Russians. The\nTurkic-speaking republics, deliberate creations within the Soviet Union, also\nseparated and found their main linguistic problem to be how closely they should\nidentify with Turkey itself. Their abandonment of the Cyrillic script and choice\nof Roman scripts rather than Arabic-Persian ones appears to indicate a close but\nsecular relationship.\nFinland is a very close, and sometimes uncomfortable, neighbor of both\nRussia and Sweden. In the nineteenth century the Finns developed theirlanguage\nto differentiate themselves from both the Russians and the Swedes by turning\nwhat was essentially an unwritten spoken language into one with a writing sys-\ntem, literature, and the full panoply of uses that signify a standard language.\nThis deliberate bit of corpus planning gave them a distinct language and\nAITC15 364 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 365\nreinforced the differences they felt to exist between them and both Russians and\nSwedes, differences further accentuated by the fact that Finnish belongs to an\nentirely different language family (Finno-Ugric) from the other two languages\n(Indo-European).\nIn a more general vein, we can observe that there was a marked difference in\nthe twentieth century in the way in which the old European and central Asian\nempires broke up and the way in which imperial bonds were loosened elsewhere\nin South and Southeast Asia and in Africa. When the Austro-Hungarian,Russian,\nand Ottoman Empires broke up, the result was the emergence of nation-states\nbased primarily on claims about language with a consequent complete redraw-\ning of boundaries. This redrawing did not suit everyone, since many former\nminorities proved to be no more tolerant of smaller \u2018captive\u2019 language groups\nthan their previous oppressors once they had achieved political recognition as\nnation-states. When European imperialism was finally effectively removed from\nAsia and Africa, however, there was no such redrawing of political boundaries.\nThe previous colonies, often peculiar amalgams of language and ethnic groups,\nsince conquest rather than language or ethnicity had accounted for their ori-\ngins, became independent whole states except in a few cases, such as Pakistan,\nBurma, and Sri Lanka, when there was successful separation in contrast to\nBiafra\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to secede from Nigeria and Katanga\u2019s from Za\u00efre.\nMany of the resultant states have no common language, no common ethnicity,\nand strong internal linguistic and ethnic rivalries, making national planning and\nconsensus difficult to achieve at the best.\nOne important consequence is that the new states of Africa and Asia are often\nmultilingual but, as a result of their histories, have elites who speak a European\nlanguage such as English or French. This language not only serves many as an\ninternal working language but is also still regarded as the language of mobility.\nIt is both the language that transcends local loyalties and the one that opens up\naccess to the world outside the state. It is unlikely that in these circumstances\nsuch outside languages will disappear; rather, it is likely that they will continue\nto be used and that positions of leadership will continue to go only to those who\nhave access to them, unless present conditions change.\nAn attempt is sometimes made to find a \u2018neutral\u2019 language, that is, a language\nwhich is not English and which gives no group an advantage. In 1974 President\nKenyatta of Kenya decreed that Swahili was to become the language of the\ncountry, the language of national unity, even though most Kenyans did not\nspeak the language; it was not the language of the major city, Nairobi; it was\nspoken in a variety of dialects and pidgins; the majority of those who did speak\nit did not speak it well; and English was better known in the higher echelonsof\ngovernment, the professions, and so on. Both Swahili and English were toremain\nas official languages, however. Swahili was chosen over one of the local lan-\nguages, e.g., the president\u2019s own Kikuyu, a language spoken by about 20 percent\nof the population, because the ethnic composition of the country made anyother\nchoice too difficult and dangerous. In that respect, Swahili was a neutral lan-\nguage. It was for much the same reason \u2013 that it was a neutral unifying language\nin a state with over 100 indigenous languages \u2013 that Swahili was also chosen\nin Tanzania as the national language, although in this case it was spoken fairly\nAITC15 365 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 366 Planning\nwidely as a trade language along the coast and also in the capital, Dar es\nSalaam. The consequence of the 1974 decree in Kenya is that Swahili is now\nused much more than it was, but it has not by any means replaced English in\nthose areas of use in which English was previously used.\nAlthough the use of Swahili in Kenya has become a matter of national pride,\nthis does not mean that its extension into certain spheres of life goes unresisted.\nOne consequence has been that Kenyans have developed their own version, or\nversions, of the language. Like Tanzanians, they speak \u2018bad\u2019 Swahili, according\nto many of those for whom it is an ancestral language. The Kenyan and Tan-\nzanian varieties are also different. National pride may cause even further differ-\nentiation to emerge, with the Kenyan variety of Swahili eventually becoming\nsomewhat different from the original coastal variety of the language on which\nit is based and different from the Tanzanian variety standardized on the speech\nof Zanzibar: Kenya\u2019s variety is likely to be based on the speech of Mombasa.\nCurrently, Tanzania has moved much further than Kenya in the use of Swahili.\nHowever, full social mobility in both countries requires a citizen to be able to\nuse Swahili, English, and one or more local vernaculars since each has appro-\npriate occasions for use.\nIndia, with more than a billion people, is another country which has had\nto face similar problems. In this case the solution has been to promote Hindi\nin the Devanagari script as the official language that unites the state, but more\nthan a dozen other languages, including Sanskrit, are recognized as official\nlanguages in the nation\u2019s constitution. However, there are serious obstacles to\nthe spread of Hindi in India. There is a considerable difference between liter-\nary Hindi and the various regional and local spoken varieties (see chapter 2).\nGandhi tried to emphasize building Hindi on popular speech so as to bridge the\ngap between the literary and colloquial varieties and also to unify the regions.In\nan attempt to overcome some of the difficulties, the Indian governmentestablished\nvarious groups to develop scientific terminology, glossaries, dictionaries, and an\nencyclopedia. One noticeable development has been the way in which those\nentrusted with such tasks, usually the Hindi elite, have looked to Sanskrit in\ntheir work: they have followed a policy of Sanskritization in their attempts to\npurify Hindi of English and also increasingly to differentiate Hindi from Urdu,\nthe variety of the language used in Muslim Pakistan. The effects have been\nparticularly noticeable in literary Hindi, which has possibly grown further away\nfrom the evolving colloquial varieties as a result of such activities. There has\nbeen some periodic dissatisfaction with what has happened (Gumperz, 1971,\npp. 146\u20137), for example with teaching Hindi in the same way as Sanskrit has\nbeen taught traditionally.\nThe linguistic situation in India is further complicated today in a way it was\nnot complicated at the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan(and\nthen later into a third state, Bangladesh). India came into existence as a unitary\nstate. However, local opposition to such centralization was strong and the coun-\ntry was quickly reorganized by states, the first being the Telugu-speaking Andhra\nstate in 1953. Now India has two important levels of government, the central\none in New Delhi looking after common interests, and the other, the state\nlevel with each state government looking after that state\u2019s interests and, more\nAITC15 366 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 367\nimportantly, doing so in the language of that state and not in the Hindi or\nEnglish of the central government.\nHindi is often viewed in India as giving northern Indians unwarranted ad-\nvantages over Indians elsewhere. This feeling is particularly strong in the\nsouth of India, where various Dravidian languages are spoken. To that extent,\nEnglish continues to offer certain advantages. Its use spread throughout the\nupper social strata everywhere in India in the former imperial regime; now it\ncan be viewed as quite neutral even though, of course, its use may be opposed\nstrongly at an official level, where it is recognized only as an \u2018auxiliary\u2019 language\n(Inglehart and Woodward, 1967). English is used in the higher courts, as a\nlanguage of parliamentary debate, as a preferred language in the universities,\nand as a language of publication in learned journals. Although Hindi is pro-\nmoted as the unifying language of India, many Indians now see such promotion\nto be at the expense of some other language they speak, or a set of religious\nbeliefs, or the opportunity to acquire a world language like English. Language\nplanning in India, however, is largely confined to elites: the masses, whose\nneeds are more immediate, are largely unaffected. Like any other kind of\nplanning in India, it seems fraught with difficulties, dangers, and unforeseen\nconsequences.\nFinally, if we return to the English-speaking world, or rather to a country\nwhich is assumed to be thoroughly committed to English, we can observe how\nit too must confront a number of issues to do with language. Language planning\nhas become a serious concern in the United States in recent years, particularly\nas a result of a recognition that there is a large indigenous Spanish-speaking\npopulation and because of continued immigration into the country (see Fishman,\n1966, and Veltman, 1983). Recent censuses have shown that as many as one in\nsix people in the United States do not have English as their mother tongue, that\nthe majority of these are native-born Americans and that the proportion is\ngrowing, particularly in the southwest, i.e., Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and\nCalifornia, and along parts of the eastern seaboard (Waggoner, 1981). A recent\nsource (Huntington, 2004) points out that Hispanics comprised 12 percent of\nthe population in 2000, that their proportion in the total population exceeded\nthat of black Americans in 2002, and that it is estimated that by 2040 25\npercent of the total population will be of Hispanic origin (p. 224). In recent\nyears, too, more and more languages from Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle\nEast are represented in the population.\nNot only is a language other than English the mother tongue of a great\nnumber of residents of the United States, but many do not speak English at all\nor speak it with difficulty. There is obviously a vast resource of languages in the\nUnited States, but the traditional policy of assimilation is still widely pursued.\nEnglish is very much the language of the mainstream, and even though lan-\nguages such as Spanish may be in widespread use in some areas and have certain\nofficial approval there, this use is motivated by pragmatic concerns alone. We\ncan note that only two of the states are officially bilingual: New Mexico, with\nthe other language being Spanish, and Hawaii, with the other language being\nHawaiian. It is of interest to note too that in 1993 Puerto Ricans restored\nEnglish as an official language in the Commonwealth after an earlier 1991 law\nAITC15 367 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 368 Planning\nmade Spanish the sole official language. English had become part of Puerto\nRican identity (Morris, 1996, Velez and Schweers, 1993).\nFishman (1981) has pointed out that Americans regard English as something\nto be used rather than something that they necessarily must take pride in.\nMoreover, this view spreads to other languages too, with one consequence being\nthat, since most Americans are monolingually English, little effort is expended\non preserving other languages. Indeed, as Fishman observes (p. 517), \u2018The great-\nest American linguistic investment by far has been in the Anglification of its\nmillions of immigrant and indigenous speakers of other languages.\u2019 The Bilin-\ngual Education Act, he insists, was primarily \u2018an act for the Anglification of\nnon-English speakers and not an act for bilingualism,\u2019 but rather an act against\nbilingualism. Bilingualism is seen as potentially divisive in the United States\nas \u2018Quebecization\u2019 or \u2018Balkanization,\u2019 in Fishman\u2019s words. Bilingual education,\ntherefore, is expediency. It is transitional education designed to ease those who\ndo not speak English into the mainstream of English. As Fishman says (p. 522),\n\u2018Language maintenance in the USA is not part of public policy because it is\nrarely recognized as being in the public interest,\u2019 being regarded as divisive and\nincompatible with progress, modernity, and efficiency.\nThe United States actually has no official language but, as Schiffman (1996,\np. 213) says, the language policy of the United States:\nis not neutral, it favors the English language. No statute or constitutional amend-\nment or regulatory law is necessary to maintain this covert policy \u2013 its strength lies\nin the basic assumptions that American society has about language. These basic\nassumptions range from simple communicative competence in English to deeply\nheld prejudices, attitudes, biases (often supported by religious belief), and other\n\u2018understandings\u2019 that constitute what I call American linguistic culture, which is\nthe locus of covert policy in this (or any) polity.\nThere has even been a move in Congress in recent years to amend the constitu-\ntion in order to make English the official language and many individual states\nhave enacted legislation giving English official status within them (see Adams\nand Brink, 1990, Baron, 1990, Crawford, 1992a, 1992b, and Schmid, 2001).\nThose in favor of this move believe that the increasing use of other languages\nthan English in the United States, and in particular the increasing use of Spanish,\nposes some kind of internal threat. Rickford (2004) has even gone so far as to\nclaim that some of the hostility shown to Ebonics (see p. 349) arose from this\nsame source: fear of recognizing any other language than Standard English.\nProponents of English only have pointed to Canada as an example of a country\nwhere bilingualism has not worked in their argument for making the United\nStates officially monolingual in English. That official bilingualism may have\nactually been Canada\u2019s salvation seems not to have occurred to them, nor does\nthe fact that the two countries have had entirely different, though not necessar-\nily unrelated, histories.\nIn the United States there is a growing awareness that the country is not\nunilingual and that either an attempt must be made to make it so or there must\nbe some recognition that it is not so (see Dicker, 1996). Huntington (2004),\na prominent American political scientist, says that Americans are currently\nAITC15 368 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 369\nexperiencing a crisis of identity. For nearly two centuries they upheld the \u2018Amer-\nican creed,\u2019 some of the components of which were the English language, Chris-\ntianity, religious commitment, the rule of law, the importance of individual\nrights, Protestant values of individualism, and a strong work ethic (p. xvi).\nAccording to Huntington, this creed provided Americans with a national iden-\ntity that began to erode in the 1960s and continues to do so still under an influx\nof immigrants, a tolerance of multilingualism, the encouragement ofbilingualism,\nthe rise of group identities based on race, ethnicity, and gender, the growing\ncommitment of elites to cosmopolitan identities and globalization (acommitment\nnot shared by the population at large), and after the late 1980s no perceived\nexternal enemy (until 2001). He says that English-only moves, hostility to group\nrights and bilingual education, and the growing religiosity of the American\npopulation can all be explained as a reaction to this perceived decreased com-\nmitment to a national identity. Huntington ends by suggesting that the new\ncentury requires a reaffirmation of the traditional identity but it is clear that this\nwill not be an easy task.\nDiscussion\n1. As we saw in chapter 2, it is not at all easy to define language and to\ndistinguish it from dialect. There may be strong political and other consid-\nerations for creating numerous distinctions where few originally existed, or\nfor doing the opposite. Supply examples where differences have deliberately\nbeen created between varieties of a language or between languages them-\nselves to accentuate differences. Supply examples of the opposite kind too,\nthat is, of deliberate attempts to minimize differences.\n2. Discussing the origins of Flemish, Dutch, German, and Afrikaans, Deutsch\n(1968, pp. 602\u20133) remarks as follows: \u2018It was not at first these languages\nthat made history; it was history that made these languages.\u2019 What do you\nunderstand by this remark? If Deutsch\u2019s observation is correct, what are its\nimplications for emerging nations?\n3. The Polish, Czech, and Romanian alphabets were Romanized in the nine-\nteenth century and Cyrillic alphabets were abandoned. How might you\naccount for such changes?\n4. Many new Asian and African states are multilingual and multi-ethnic. They\nare nearly all subject to the same pressures which led to the foundation of\nEuropean-type nation-states founded on linguistic and ethnic groupings,\npressures which could result in their break-up. What kinds of planning\nactivities appear to be necessary if these new states are to evolve in a\ndifferent way from those owing their origin to linguistic and ethnic separat-\nism? What kinds of planning appear to be necessary in the latter both to\nreduce national rivalries and deal with \u2018captive\u2019 minorities?\n5. Hebrew has been successfully revived in Israel, but the Irish have been\nunsuccessful in their attempts to revive Irish Gaelic in Ireland. Today, Gaelic\nis spoken by less than 5 percent of the population and then only in small\npockets, mainly along the west coast. What factors seem to explain success\nin one case and failure in the other?\nAITC15 369 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 370 Planning\n6. The United States has nearly always been characterized as a \u2018melting-pot\u2019 so\nfar as its linguistic treatment of immigrants and even of minorities has been\nconcerned. To what extent has the myth been based on fact? Is it still valid\nto any extent? You might also compare this myth with that of the \u2018cultural\nmosaic\u2019 said to be favored by its neighbor Canada, and ask the same two\nquestions about that country and its myth.\nFurther Examples\nSome further examples of kinds of planning decisions that have been made in\na number of countries in different parts of the world will show how difficult at\ntimes planning can be. The first example is Papua New Guinea, a nation of 700\nor more indigenous languages, some, possibly more than a third, with fewerthan\n500 speakers, and this in a total population of approximately 4 million. Papua\nNew Guinea has three official languages which are all second languages to the\nvast majority of its people: Hiri Motu, Tok Pisin, and English. The first two\nare pidgin-based languages. Of the three, Tok Pisin is becoming more and more\nthe first language of many young people, particularly city dwellers. Although\nall children learn English in school and most parents feel that knowledge of\nEnglish brings great advantages to their children, very little use is made of Eng-\nlish outside certain formal contexts, e.g., in schools and in certain occupations\nsuch as the legal profession. Tok Pisin is now used almost exclusively for\npurposes of debate in the House Assembly, which is the parliament of Papua\nNew Guinea. It is also frequently used in broadcasting, even to report on and\ndiscuss matters of considerable complexity, and increasingly in the press and\nin education, particularly at the lower levels. One representative view of the\nimportance of Tok Pisin to Papua New Guinea is the following (Wolfers, 1971,\npp. 418\u201319):\n[Tok Pisin], then, whatever one may argue as to its intrinsic merits, has revolution-\nized New Guinea society. It has broken down old barriers, and allowed for direct\ninter-racial and inter-language-group communication where this was not previously\npossible. It has made a national radio news-service feasible, and a newspaper, the\nNu Gini Toktok, available to the relatively unsophisticated. The pidgin has been\none of the most important elements in the Territory\u2019s slow and hesitant groping\ntowards nationhood. Its very history, its origins on the plantations and in Euro-\npean employ generally, have allowed for, if not encouraged, the growth of that\ncommon set of experiences and attitudes from which a nation grows.\nTok Pisin is a pidgin-based language; consequently, it must be developed to\nmeet the various new needs it must serve. Such growth is not without its dif-\nficulties. One particular development that has met with negative reaction from\na number of linguists is that, for pragmatic reasons, vocabulary expansion has\ntaken place through large-scale borrowing from English, rather than through the\nexploitation of native resources, e.g., words such as amenmen, ekspendisa, eleksen,\nAITC15 370 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 371\nkomisin, mosin, praim minista, privilij, and spika. English exerts a powerful\ninfluence on Tok Pisin. Anglicized varieties of the language may show not only\nborrowings of English words but also the occasional English plural -s, use of\nEnglish subordination patterns and the English counting system, and so on. At\nthe moment, in spite of certain Anglicizations that are apparent in some var-\nieties, Tok Pisin is still so distinct from English that there is no evidence of a\ncontinuum between Tok Pisin and English. However, there is a real danger that\na continuum could develop with Standard English at the \u2018top\u2019 and local varieties\nof Tok Pisin at the \u2018bottom,\u2019 much as in Jamaica (see p. 81), with all the\nattendant problems.\nTok Pisin has also developed a number of sub-varieties, particularly in urban\nareas, so that it is now not as uniform as it once was. There is some risk that,\nwithout a deliberate effort to standardize the language, it will not remain as\nefficient a lingua franca as it has been. Deliberate language planning rather than\nad hoc developments seem increasingly necessary. It is also in the country\u2019s\ninterest that the variety that should be developed is the rural variety, the less\nAnglicized, more stable variety recognized by the people themselves as the \u2018good\u2019\nvariety of Tok Pisin.\nHiri Motu is the other pidgin-based official language of Papua New Guinea.\nIt is identified with Papua and Papuan languages are quite different from those\nin New Guinea. Many people there take great pride in using Hiri Motu, the\ndescendant of Police Mutu, a native-based, pidgin language of the area, rather\nthan Tok Pisin to show local loyalties. The result has been a dramatic increase\nin the use of Hiri Motu in Papua New Guinea, particularly among separatist-\nminded Papuans.\nAs we can see, then, each of the three official languages of Papua New Guinea\nconfers advantages of certain kinds to its speakers. However, it seems still too\nearly to predict the future pattern of coexistence for the three languages and, of\ncourse, for those who speak them.\nOur second example is Singapore (see also pp. 101\u20132), an independentrepublic\nof approximately 3 million people (see Kuo, 1977). It is also a small island,\nsituated at the tip of the Malayan peninsula with another large Malay-speaking\nnation, Indonesia, to its south. The 2000 census showed its population to be\napproximately 77 percent Chinese, 14 percent Malays, 8 percent Indians, andjust\nover 1 percent others, e.g., Eurasians, Europeans, and Arabs. Five major lan-\nguages are spoken in Singapore (Malay, English, Mandarin, Tamil, and Hokkien)\nand three minor ones (Teochew, Cantonese, and Hainanese). At the time of\nindependence four of these languages were given official status: Malay,Mandarin,\nTamil, and English. The first three represented Singapore\u2019s traditions; the last\nwas deliberately chosen because of its international status, particularlyimportant\nbecause of Singapore\u2019s position as a trading nation. Officially, it is a language\nof convenience only, a neutral language dissociated from issues of ethnicity\n(Lee, 2002).\nOf the four official languages, Malay is also the national language because of\nSingapore\u2019s position in the Malay world, not because more people in Singapore\nspeak or understand Malay better than any other language. However, English\nhas become the working language of Singapore: it is the language of the\nAITC15 371 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 372 Planning\ngovernment bureaucracy, the authoritative language of all legislation and court\njudgments, and the language of occupational mobility and social and economic\nadvancement (see Foley, 1988). It is also the language of banking, work in\ngovernment offices, public transportation, hotels and tourism, and much non-\nfood shopping. All schoolchildren are required to learn English (Gupta, 1994)\nand another of the official languages, although the first language of instruction\ncan be any one of the four official languages. However, the majority of parents\nchoose English-medium schools for their children.\nOne result of these decisions has been that English is now understood by\nmore than half the population, even though only a much smaller percentage\nspeak it comfortably. \u2018English is becoming the dominant language; it already is\nthe de facto national language of intra- and inter-communication\u2019 (Foley, 1988,\np. xvi). Although the major Chinese language in Singapore is Hokkien, it is\nMandarin, the language that unites Singapore to China, that is taught in schools.\nThere has been a dramatic increase in recent years, therefore, in the percentage\nof the population who understand Mandarin. The government also actively\nsupports the use of Mandarin in its \u2018Speak Mandarin\u2019 campaign and seeks to\neradicate the other Chinese \u2018dialects\u2019 (Gupta, 1994, Gupta and Yeok, 1995).\nMalay continues to have a place in everyday life in Singapore but knowledge of\nTamil has declined. Consequently, a native of Singapore is likely to understand,\nand use, with different levels of success, Mandarin, Hokkien, English, Malay,\nand local varieties of each of these. Truly a multilingual situation!\nThis multilingualism is particularly prevalent in the younger generation, and,\nsince Singapore is also a country with a large proportion of young people in\nits population, it is likely to be a change that will accelerate. A survey of 15-\nto 20-year-olds in 1975 showed them able to understand the major languages\nas follows: English (87.3 percent), Malay (50.3 percent), Mandarin (72.5 per-\ncent), Hokkien (74.0 percent), and Tamil (5.8 percent). A comparison across\nage-groups showed that young people had a much better knowledge (i.e., un-\nderstanding) of English and Mandarin than old people, but only a slightly better\nknowledge of Hokkien, and much less knowledge of Malay and Tamil. In 2004\nthe Singapore Minister of Education acknowledged that about half of Singa-\npore\u2019s ethnic Chinese children use English at home compared with 34 percent\nin 1994 and that such use of English is increasing: \u2018There is a clear generational\nshift in language use at home\u2019 (The Times, December 18, 2004). Such evidence\nwould appear to confirm that Singapore is basically a Chinese nation somewhat\nprecariously located in a Malay-speaking area and extremely conscious of the\nfact that its vitality and future lie in preserving a Chinese heritage in a trading\nworld dominated by English.\nThe language policies pursued by the government of Singapore are not\nwithout certain difficulties because they are allied to a policy which says that\nSingapore itself has no distinctive culture but is a composite of three cultures:\nChinese, Malay, and Indian. Each group is forced to distinguish itself culturally\nfrom the others to achieve support, yet it must be careful in what it promotes\nso as not to offend the others and not to appear to be too closely attached\nto foreign places. Banton (1983, p. 394) has described the consequences as\nfollows:\nAITC15 372 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 373\nthe policy presses the Chinese to become more Chinese, the Indians more Indian\nand the Malays more Malay. Each culture turns in upon itself since it has to be\nSingaporean and cannot develop ties with the original homeland. Secondly, the arts\n(or \u2018high\u2019 culture) have difficulty obtaining official support and financial backing.\nIndividualistic (and therefore \u2018non-racial\u2019) creations are seen as irrelevant or pos-\nsibly as examples of decadent foreign influence. Thirdly, the Singaporeans\u2019 image\nof themselves and of their history is distorted to fit the four-category model. Cultural\ncharacteristics are assumed to derive from distinctive genetic backgrounds and\ntherefore to change only very slowly indeed. In reality, people of all groups are\nchanging as they adapt to the opportunities provided by a bustling commercial city,\nand this is the real basis for a commonality of culture which is growing rapidly.\nThe current plans for language and culture in Singapore may be creating certain\nparadoxes, even contradictions, which may require at some point still another\nround of planning and considerable changes.\nThe third example is also that of a small country, this time one with a\npopulation of about 4 million people who are faced with the problem of recon-\nciling an internal linguistic split. Modern Norway with its two varieties of one\nlanguage, or its two languages in some views, has some particularly interesting\nproblems so far as planning is concerned. When, after four centuries of domina-\ntion, the Norwegians managed to separate themselves politically from Denmark\nin 1814, the country found itself with a variety of Danish and local dialects\nbut no national language (Haugen, 1966b, 1968). In the nineteenth century\ntherefore attempts were made to develop a Norwegian language. Two attempts\nwere noteworthy, those of Knud Knudsen and Ivar Aasen. The former developed\na language which is a modified variety of Standard Danish, known later as\nRiksm\u00e5l \u2018State language\u2019 (since 1928 called Bokm\u00e5l \u2018Book language\u2019); the latter\ndeveloped a language based on local Norwegian dialects, known as Landsm\u00e5l\n\u2018Language of the country\u2019 (now called Nynorsk \u2018New Norwegian\u2019). We can see\nthe similarities in the two languages from the following sentences (and their\ngloss) taken from Haugen (1968, pp. 686\u20137):\nNynorsk\nDet rette heimlege m\u00e5i i landet er det som landets folk har arva ifr\u00e5 forfedrene, fr\u00e5\nden eine \u00e6tta til den andre, og som no om stunder, trass i all fortrengsle og\nvanv\u00f8nad, enno har grunnlag og emne til eit bokm\u00e5l, like s\u00e5 godt som noko av\ngrannfolk-m\u00e5la.\nBokm\u00e5l\nDet rette heimlige m\u00e5l i landet er det som landets folk har arvet ifra forfedrene,fra\nden ene \u00e6tt til den andre, og som n\u00e5 om stunder, trass i all fortrengsle og vanv\u00f8nad,\nenn\u00e5 har grunnlag og emne til et bokm\u00e5l, like s\u00e5 godt som noe av nabo-m\u00e5lene.\nEnglish\nThe right native tongue in this country is the one that the people of the country\nhave inherited from their ancestors, from one generation to the next, and which\nnowadays, in spite of all displacement and contempt, still has the basis and mater-\nial for a written language just as good as any of the neighbors\u2019 languages.\nAITC15 373 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 374 Planning\nDuring the twentieth century the major planning task has been to unite the\ntwo varieties, since, as we can see, they do differ in certain ways in spelling,\ngrammar, and vocabulary. Progress in that unification has been slow as com-\npromises have not been easy to achieve. It is now virtually at a standstill and\nlanguage reform continues to be a contentious issue in Norway. Although,\naccording to its defenders, Nynorsk is said to be more \u2018Norwegian\u2019 in spirit,\nmany Norwegians find certain aspects of it vulgar and rustic because of its\norigins in western rural dialects; consequently, they reject it in favor of the more\n\u2018civilized\u2019 Bokm\u00e5l. Currently, the proponents of Bokm\u00e5l are in the stronger posi-\ntion linguistically in that this variety more closely conforms to standard collo-\nquial (i.e., spoken) Norwegian, but \u2018true\u2019 nationalists still insist on Nynorsk,\nBokm\u00e5l still being too \u2018Danish\u2019 for them. Today, Bokm\u00e5l is the language of the\nnational press and the majority of books, and the instructional medium of five\nout of every six schoolchildren. Bokm\u00e5l dominates the towns and cities, but\nofficial documents still employ both varieties, and children must learn to use\nboth. The search for a compromise goes on, but it is unlikely that Norwegians\nwill easily agree on one variety to the exclusion of the other while an important\nregional minority regards Nynorsk as a clear marker of their identity (Vik\u00f8r,\n2002).\nOur fourth example of language planning is Canada, a country of 31 million\npeople, which is now, by its new constitution of 1982, a constitutionally bilin-\ngual country. However, bilingualism itself continues to be a controversial issue\nin Canada, as anyone who reads its newspapers or follows political discussions\nthere will know. Canada is a federal country, with its origins in the conquest of\nthe French (of what is now Quebec) by the English in 1759. This conquest was\nfollowed by the gradual expansion of the nation to include other British posses-\nsions in North America and to fill the prairies to the north of the United States.\nAlthough the country dates its \u2018birth\u2019 to 1867 and it was effectively independent\nfrom the United Kingdom after that date, its constitution remained an act of the\nParliament of the United Kingdom until 1982. Controversies over language\nrights played a prominent part in discussions leading up to making the consti-\ntution entirely Canadian in 1982.\nIn 1867 the French in Canada seemed assured of opportunities to spread their\nlanguage and culture throughout the country. Just as English rights in Quebec\nwere protected in the constitution of that year, so French rights outside Quebec\nseemed to have a strong measure of protection. But that was not to be, as the\nFrench soon found in the new province of Manitoba, where French rights were\ndeliberately abrogated. Increasingly, the French in Canada found themselves\nconfined to Quebec, itself dominated by the English of Montreal, and saw the\ncountry develop as a country of two nations (or \u2018two solitudes\u2019) with one of\nthem \u2013 theirs \u2013 in a very inferior position. Today, of the less than 30 percent of\nCanadians who are of French origin, approximately 80 percent live in the prov-\nince of Quebec.\nThe Canadian government appointed a Royal Commission on Bilingualism\nand Biculturalism in 1963 to look into the resulting situation. The commission\u2019s\nreport led to the Official Languages Act of 1969 (reaffirmed in a new form\nin 1988), which guaranteed the French in Canada certain rights to language\nAITC15 374 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 375\neverywhere in the country in order to preserve the nation as a bilingual one. The\nact also appointed an ombudsman, a Commissioner of Official Languages, to\nreport annually to Parliament on progress in implementing new policies. Later,\nthe Constitution Act of 1982 incorporated these language rights guaranteed by\nstatute in 1969 into the patriated constitution. However, if Canada is officially\na \u2018bilingual\u2019 country, bilingualism in the two official languages is found mainly\nin the population of French origin and truly bilingual communities are few, e.g.,\nMontreal, Sherbrooke, and the Ottawa-Hull area.\nAt the same time as the Government of Canada was guaranteeing French\nrights throughout Canada, the Government of Quebec took measures tominimize\nthe use of English within the province. While the federal government was trying\nto extend bilingualism in the rest of Canada, the Government of Quebec was\ntrying to restore French unilingualism within Quebec. They did this becausethey\nfound that bilingualism led to unilingualism in English. Outside Quebec, the\nFrench in Canada were losing French in favor of English as they went over the\ngenerations from being unilingual in French, to being bilingual in French and\nEnglish, and finally to being unilingual in English. There was mounting evidence\nthat this was also happening within Quebec. However, such moves to restrict\nthe use of English in Quebec, e.g., in public education, have come under attackas\na violation of rights provided in the new constitution, and in 1984 the Supreme\nCourt of Canada voided those parts of Quebec\u2019s Bill 101 of 1977 that restricted\ncertain rights of anglophones in that province. Quebec does have a variety of\nlanguage laws to protect French in the province and the authorities are vigilant\nin enforcing them. Some of those who dislike these laws have moved to other\nprovinces. Others, particularly immigrants, often prefer to learn English rather\nthan French, but between 1971 and 2001 governmental measures have increased\nthe proportion of those who learn French from 29 percent to 46 percent.\nCertain legislation on the statute books in Manitoba for nearly a century has\nlikewise been voided for denying francophone rights in that province, e.g., to\nhave legislation enacted in French.\nThe basic English\u2013French polarization still exists. The French are still aminor-\nity in Canada. Their proportion in the overall population continues to decline,no\nmatter what statistic is used (ethnic origin, mother tongue use, or language of\nthe home), with that decline being over 1 percent between the nationalcensuses\nof 1971 and 1981. By the 1991 census whereas 73 percent of the population\nreported English as their first official language only 25 percent reported French\nand that proportion continues to fall. The decline in the use of French is par-\nticularly noticeable outside Quebec. It is not really surprising, therefore, that in\nrecent years the French within Quebec have toyed with \u2018separatist\u2019 notions,\nbelieving that, if they cannot guarantee their future within Canada as a whole,\nthey should at least guarantee it within their home province. The separatist\ndesire increased dramatically in 1990 with the failure that year to reach a\ncountrywide agreement \u2013 the so-called Meech Lake Accord \u2013 on amending the\n1982 constitution. A further attempt at some kind of constitutional settlement\nfailed in 1992 when the Charlottetown Agreement was defeated in a national\nreferendum. However, in 1995 a Quebec referendum on separation from Canada\nalso failed, narrowly though, to gain support for such a move.\nAITC15 375 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 376 Planning\nThe language situation is further complicated by the fact that Canada is\nalso a country of immigrants who have flocked mainly to the larger cities. For\nexample, in 1996, 37 percent of the residents of Toronto and 34 percent of\nthe residents of Vancouver had a mother tongue other than English or French.\nThere are large numbers of speakers of Italian, German, Ukrainian, Portuguese,\nSpanish, Polish, and Chinese. (In 1996, 17 percent of the Canadian population\nwere immigrants in contrast to 8 percent in the United States.) Many of these\nimmigrants face language loss, and some who speak on their behalf say that the\nFrench in Canada, particularly the French outside Quebec, should have no\nprivileges, so far as language is concerned, that they themselves do not enjoy.\nThis feeling is particularly strong in many parts of western Canada. The import-\nance of such claims is better understood if one realizes that Canadians of ethnic\norigins other than French or English now comprise the same proportion of\nthe Canadian population as those of French origin. The French of Quebec are\nentirely opposed to the idea that they are just another non-English group within\nCanada. In the view of many they are one of the two founding peoples and a\n\u2018nation\u2019 with the right to separate whenever conditions are right.\nLanguage planning in Canada is obviously not complete. The ongoing dispute\nover the constitution and moves to enact various language laws that might be\nacceptable within the new constitutional framework are but the latest incidents\nin Canada\u2019s continual concern with language planning. Canada\u2019s two official\nlanguages are increasingly becoming territorially based (like the situation in\nSwitzerland and Belgium). However, the constitution rejects such \u2018territoriality.\u2019\nIt is not a happy situation.\nOur final example is China, a state with 1.3 billion inhabitants. Eight differ-\nent varieties of Chinese, Hanyu (the \u2018Han\u2019 language), are spoken. Linguists call\nthese eight different varieties \u2018languages\u2019 but the Chinese themselves prefer to\ncall them different dialects (fang yan) because of the writing system they share.\nAmong those who speak Hanyu, the following percentages are said to speak\nthese varieties: Mandarin 71 percent, Wu 8 percent, Xiang 5 percent, Cantonese\n5 percent, Hakka 4 percent, Southern Min (Fukienese) 3 percent, Gan 2 percent,\nand Northern Min (Fukienese) 1 percent. There are also estimated to be about\n5 percent of speakers of non-Chinese languages in China, languages such as\nMongolian, Tibetan, and Korean. Although Mandarin is by far the dominant\nlanguage numerically and geographically, it is only quite recently that it has\nachieved a political status commensurate with its numbers, since an archaic\nform of Chinese dominated written usage well into the twentieth century. Lan-\nguage reform and planning has long been a feature of Chinese life, but it has\nbecome increasingly important since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina.\nThere are plans to change Chinese in three ways: the first is to simplifyChinese\ncharacters; the second is to popularize the Beijing variety of Mandarin, Putonghua\n(\u2018the common language\u2019), as it is now referred to; the third is to develop a\nphonetic alphabet. As we will see, only very limited progress has been made in\nall three areas, even though the changes advocated by the Committee onLanguage\nReform have the strong support of the State Council of the central government.\nAITC15 376 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 377\nThe simplification of the estimated 7,000\u20138,000 Chinese characters has been\ngiven top priority, and periodically the Committee on Language Reformpublishes\nlists of new simplifications and recommends that they be used. The goal is to\nsimplify about half of the characters. The recommendations are widelyfollowed,\nso that all new publications are printed in simplified characters, many public\nsigns employ them, and they are taught in schools. Today, the effect of this\nsimplification is easily observed: Chinese materials printed in China use simpli-\nfied characters, whereas those produced in Hong Kong and Taiwan and by most\noverseas Chinese continue to use the unsimplified ones.\nMuch effort has also gone into extending the use of Putonghua throughout\nthe nation. Putonghua actually uses the pronunciation of Beijing, the grammar\nof the northern dialects, and the vocabulary of modern literary Chinese. It has\nbecome the language of Chinese political life, its use is encouraged on various\noccasions, and it is increasingly taught in schools. However, in such a vast\ncountry as China, the extension of Putonghua is a complex and formidable task\nthat will require a long period of time for completion. At the moment, more\nand more use of Putonghua is noticeable in large urban areas, e.g., Canton\nand Shanghai. There is also considerable tolerance for local pronunciations of\nPutonghua, and those who do not speak it at all do not see it as a threat to the\nvarieties they do speak; instead, Putonghua is acknowledged to be the national\nlanguage just as some other variety is the local one.\nSo far as the phoneticization of Chinese writing is concerned, that is, the\ndevelopment of an alphabetic writing system, the current use of Pinyin is merely\nthe latest in a series of attempts to alphabetize; for example, the Wade-Giles\nsystem going back to 1859; the proposal for a National Phonetic Alphabet in\n1913; the National Language Romanization proposed by Chao and others in\n1925\u20136; and another attempt, Latinxua (\u2018Latinization\u2019), to develop a Romanized\nscript for the Chinese living in Russia in 1913. Pinyin is now used as an aid in\nlearning Chinese characters, in certain dictionaries, and in the orthographies for\nseveral previously unwritten minority languages, e.g., Zhuang, Miao, Yi, and\nDong. Its further use seems to depend on the spread of Putonghua, but not\neveryone agrees on such use. There is agreement, however, that any spread\nshould be slow.\nThere is also considerable disagreement concerning whether Pinyin should\nreplace traditional characters or just provide a supplementary system of writing.\nWhile Pinyin is taught in early years in elementary schools, it is not used a great\ndeal, it tends to be forgotten since few materials employ it, and the attention of\nchildren is quickly directed to learning the more useful Chinese characters. The\nChinese are very conscious of their past, have a great reverence for learning,\nand their traditional writing system provides a strong unifying force; they are\nunlikely, therefore, easily to abandon it. While there is evidence that more and\nmore Chinese can use Pinyin and do use it for certain purposes in a growing\nnumber of places, e.g., on maps and street signs, and in textbooks, the changes\nare actually very moderate. The plan seems to be to move slowly in this area;\nsimplifying characters and extending the uses of Putonghua are obviously much\nmore important goals in language planning in contemporary China. We must\nAITC15 377 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 378 Planning\nalso remember that even fulfilling the simplest of goals becomes an immense\ntask when it involves so many people.\nDiscussion\n1. The size of a country seems to be quite unrelated to the problems in lan-\nguage planning it may face, because both small and large countries can have\nproblems. What seem to you to be the most important factors in creating\nproblems and in resolving them?\n2. Statements of the following kind have sometimes been made in anattempt\nto relate the number of languages spoken in a nation to the \u2018success\u2019 of that\nnation.\na. Linguistically homogeneous countries may be rich or poor, but, in\ngeneral, they are more advanced economically and more stable than\nlinguistically heterogeneous countries.\nb. The latter are always less advanced or less developed in importantways.\nc. Language uniformity is a necessary but not sufficient condition of eco-\nnomic development (see Fishman, 1968b, and Pool, 1972).\nHow correct are such observations? Are they basically correct except for\none or two notable exceptions, e.g., Switzerland? Or are the observations\ncolored entirely by their authors\u2019 value systems?\n3. Assess the \u2018wisdom\u2019 of each of the following:\na. adopting Tok Pisin instead of English in Papua New Guinea;\nb. giving official status to Mandarin rather than Hokkien in Singapore;\nc. trying to effect a compromise solution to the \u2018two-language\u2019 problem in\nNorway rather than choosing one of the languages;\nd. adopting Pinyin in China;\ne. making Canada a country bilingual in its federal machinery from coast\nto coast rather than a country of two regional unilingualisms with\nFrench in Quebec and English everywhere else.\nWinners and Losers\nIt seems fitting to close a chapter on language planning in various places in the\nworld by indicating some of the facts about languages in general. We live in a\nworld of more than 6 billion people and by the most generous estimate 6,000\nlanguages. Many of these are endangered or even dying (see Dorian, 1981,\n1989, 1998, Fase et al., 1992, Grenoble and Whaley, 1998, and M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler,\n1996). Dixon estimates that there may be actually as few as 4,000 languages\nspoken today with that number steadily decreasing. He says (1996, p. 199) that:\nAITC15 378 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 379\nEach language encapsulates the world-view of its speakers \u2013 how they think, what\nthey value, what they believe in, how they classify the world around them, how\nthey order their lives. Once a language dies, a part of human culture is lost \u2013 for\never.\nThe most important task in linguistics today \u2013 indeed, the only really important\ntask \u2013 is to get out in the field and describe languages, while this can still be done.\nNettle and Romaine (2000) voice a very similar view, say that as many as 60\npercent of all languages are already endangered, and go so far as to claim that\nsome of the endangered languages have much to tell us about the natural world,\ne.g., invaluable information about ecological matters, and even perhaps about\nthe nature of reality (see the Whorfian hypothesis, pp. 221\u20138): \u2018each language...\n[is] a way of coming to grips with the external world and developing a symbol-\nism to represent it so that it can be talked and thought about\u2019 (p. 69). Crystal\n(2000) also deplores the reduction of language diversity brought about by lan-\nguage death.\nEstimates of language loss go as high as 95 percent within the new century\nif nothing is done to stop the decline. It is for just such a reason that the\nLinguistic Society of America has gone on record as deploring language loss and\nestablished a Committee on Endangered Languages and their Preservation to\nhelp arrest it. However, we should note that not all linguists agree that they\nshould be out in the field trying to describe \u2013 and possibly preserve \u2013 threatened\nlanguages. M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler (1996) goes so far as to argue that linguists are some-\ntimes part of the problem rather than part of the solution. However, no matter\nwhat happens the number of languages spoken in the world will almost cer-\ntainly continue to decline.\nIn marked contrast to such decline, a few languages thrive, e.g., the Mandarin\nvariety of Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, and Spanish (with its enormous growth poten-\ntial in South America), and one, English, has spread everywhere in the world\n(see Wardhaugh, 1987, and Crystal, 2003b, 2004). Languages like French (even\nwhen promoted by La Francophonie), Russian, German, and Japanese, on the\nother hand, do not thrive in the same way: they win few converts and, as the\nworld\u2019s population grows, they decrease proportionally. As Crystal has pointed\nout, English spread initially through conquest and then by being in the right\nplace at the right time for use in international relations, the worldwide media,\ninternational travel, education, and now communications. He estimates that\none-quarter of the world\u2019s population have some kind of fluency in the lan-\nguage. Its major appeal is as a lingua franca, a common second language with\na certain amount of internal diversity (see Meierkord, 2004). In December 2004,\na British Council report estimated that 2 billion more people would begin learn-\ning English within a decade and by 2050 there would be over 3 billion speakers\nof English in the world. The main motivation to learn English would continue\nto be an economic one and an important consequence would be a great increase\nin bilingualism\/multilingualism in English and one or more other languages.\n(According to this report, Chinese, Arabic, and Spanish would also become\nincreasingly important languages.)\nHuntington (1996, p. 61) puts the case for English as follows:\nAITC15 379 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 380 Planning\nEnglish is the world\u2019s way of communicating interculturally just as the Christian\ncalendar is the world\u2019s way of tracking time, Arabic numbers are the world\u2019s way\nof counting, and the metric system is, for the most part, the world\u2019s way of\nmeasuring. The use of English in this way, however, is intercultural communica-\ntion; it presupposes the existence of separate cultures. A lingua franca is a way of\ncoping with linguistic and cultural differences, not a way of eliminating them. It\nis a tool for communication not a source of identity and community.\nHe adds (p. 62):\nThe people who speak English throughout the world also increasingly speak dif-\nferent Englishes. English is indigenized and takes on local colorations which dis-\ntinguish it from British or American English and which, at the extreme, make these\nEnglishes almost unintelligible one to the other, as is also the case with varieties\nof Chinese.\nIn its spread English has differentiated; there are New Englishes, and English is\nnot just a single language any more. It also lacks a dominant center; English is\npluricentric and is used to express various national identities (Schneider, 2003).\n(See also Kachru, 1992, Fishman et al., 1996, McArthur, 1998, Gordon et al.,\n2004, Hickey, 2004, and Trudgill, 2004.)\nHuntington points out that languages inherently compete with each other and\nvoices the following caution (p. 63):\nAs the power of the West gradually declines relative to that of other civilizations,\nthe use of English and other Western languages in other societies and for commun-\nication between societies will also slowly erode. If at some point in the distant\nfuture China displaces the West as the dominant civilization in the world, English\nwill give way to Mandarin as the world\u2019s lingua franca.\nHowever, Bruthiaux (2002), after reviewing possible factors that might diminish\nthe current dominance of English, concludes that no other language will \u2018dis-\nplace English as the dominant global language in the 21st century\u2019 (p. 153).\nThe spread of English in the world has not gone without critics (see Phillipson,\n1992, 2003, M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler, 1996, and Pennycook, 1998) who regard the lan-\nguage as a clear expression of political, cultural, and economic imperialism \u2013 a\nkind of dominance \u2013 and assail all efforts to promote the further use of English\nin the world, e.g., by government-sponsored teaching programs. Writing in the\ntradition of critical theory (or critical discourse analysis; see p. 350), such critics\ncannot conceive of English as a value-free language. As Pennycook says, there\nis nothing \u2018neutral\u2019 about English use in Hong Kong: \u2018this image of English use\nas an open and borrowing language, reflecting an open and borrowing people,\nis a cultural construct of colonialism that is in direct conflict with the colonial\nevidence\u2019 (p. 143). Others apply this kind of judgment everywhere English has\nspread. M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler (1996), for example, regards languages like English \u2013\nothers are Bahasa Indonesia and Mandarin Chinese \u2013 as \u2018killer languages\u2019\nbecause as national languages of modernization, education, and development\nthey stifle and eventually kill local languages. Dorian (1998, p. 9) states the\ncase unequivocally: \u2018Europeans who come from polities with a history of stand-\nardizing and promoting just one high-prestige form carried their \u201cideology of\nAITC15 380 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Planning 381\ncontempt\u201d for subordinate languages with them when they conquered far-flung\nterritories to the serious detriment of indigenous languages.\u2019\nHouse (2003) draws a different conclusion concerning the spread of English\nin the European Union. There, English is spreading because it is an effective\nlingua franca and she says that this spread may actually strengthen local lan-\nguages as people seek to maintain local identities. The European Union shows\nhow such a compromise has occurred. Wright (2004, p. 14) comes to a similar\nconclusion but one not limited to the European Union: \u2018it is not inconceivable\nthat as intergroup communication happens increasingly in English, speakers\nfrom the smaller language groups will move from being bilingual in their own\nlanguage and the national language to being bilingual in their own language and\nEnglish. This latter bilingualism might be more stable than the former.\u2019\nThere is a paradox here: linguists are told that they save languages best by\nnot acting at all; certainly they should do nothing to promote English in the\nworld, or to standardize a language, or possibly to help in any kind of language\nplanning anywhere. Yet, there is no assurance that they will save a singlelanguage\nby not acting. An alternative possibility is that intervention actually slows down\ndecline and loss. However, there is really no hard evidence for either position.\nEach is essentially ideologically derived: if you believe this you do one thing and\nif you believe that you do another. We do well to remember that because we are\ninvolved in socio-linguistic matters, ideology is likely to be at least as potent a\nfactor as science in determining which approach we ultimately adopt. Issues of\nidentity and power will also never be far from the surface.\nDiscussion\n1. Bickerton (1977, p. 197) makes the following observation: \u2018Wherepopulation\nremains stable, indigenous languages will survive and even flourish under\nconsiderable adverse pressure; where a population is abruptly transferred\nto a new terrain, languages will wither even in the fact of positive effort to\nkeep them alive.\u2019 Although Bickerton was addressing himself to pidgins and\ncreoles when he made these remarks, it seems they have a wider applic-\nability. Can you find examples to support what Bickerton says? Are there\ncounter-examples?\n2. Latin is a dead language and Hebrew once again a live one. How did Latin\ndie? (Remember it is still very much alive in the sense that French, Italian,\nSpanish, and Portuguese, i.e., its \u2018dialects,\u2019 are spoken today!) How was\nHebrew revitalized? (See Myhill, 2004.)\n3. What are some of the difficulties faced in trying to revive a dead language\nor trying to maintain, even at some minimal level, a dying language?

Just what can you\npossibly conclude when the issues are so complex, the data so varied, and the\napproaches so different? However, I will attempt to say a few words.\nOur consideration of various issues has revealed above all how complex a\nthing a language is, or any variety of a language. Languages are just as complex\nas societies, and we all know how difficult it is to make generalizations about\nthose. That languages should be so complex is not surprising. Languages and\nsocieties are related, and social and linguistic complexity are not unrelated. Just\nas it is naive to believe that there are societies that possess only very primitive\ncultures, so it is equally naive to believe that certain peoples speak primitive\nlanguages. All cultures and all languages are extremely complex. Some may\nactually be more complex than others, but we do not as yet have an exhaustive\nand definitive study of a single culture or of a single language from anywhere\nin the world, nor are there any immediate prospects of one. If both the culture\nand language of any group of people almost defy adequate description, then we\ncan be assured that the relationships that certainly exist between the two are not\nlikely to be more transparent, even to well-informed observers.\nA further complication is added by the fact that, among the various kinds of\ncomplexity we observe in language, one kind must give us considerable concern:\nthat is, the amount of variation that is apparent wherever we look. Language\nvaries in many kinds of ways, and investigations repeatedly show that people\nare aware of this fact, even though they may not be conscious of precisely what\nthey are doing or how they are reacting to the variants that others use. Variation\nseems to be an inherent property of language. If it is, it creates a number of\ntheoretical problems for linguists.\nLinguists working in the Chomskyan tradition have generally tried not to\ninvolve themselves with variation, preferring to adopt a view of language which\nsees it as homogeneous and describing a linguistic competence which theyassume\nall speakers possess. However, if an important part of the linguistic competence\nof language users is their ability to handle variation and the various uses of\nlanguage in society, then the competence that needs to be explained is one that\nencompasses a much wider range of abilities: it is communicative competence,\nof which linguistic competence is but a part. While sociolinguists have talked\nAITC16 383 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 384 Conclusion\nat length, however, about communicative competence, attempts to specify just\nwhat it is have not been very successful, probably because it is so complex and\nall-encompassing. Furthermore, attempts to use the concept in applied work,\ne.g., the teaching of foreign languages, have tended to rely more on rhetoric\nthan on substance.\nIf there is such a thing as communicative competence, and there must surely\nbe in some sense, a further problem arises in trying to explain how it develops\nin individuals. Just how does an individual learn to use the variants of alinguistic\nvariable, to code-switch, to use sexist language, and so on? Moreover, how does\nthat individual learn to use these in the same way as certain other individuals\nand in slightly different ways from still other individuals? What are the social\nforces that bring about such learning, what intellectual abilities are called for,\nand what survival value follows from the results? These are all very important\nlinguistic and social problems, answers to which will bring us important under-\nstanding about human linguistic and social organization.\nOne of the facts that our various inquiries have certainly shown is that the\ndata we can use in explorations of the relationships between language andsociety\nseem boundless. Moreover, there is no shortage of concepts and categories avail-\nable to use in our attempts to make sense of those data. We have seen various\nattempts at such organization. We can begin with concepts like \u2018language\u2019 and\n\u2018dialect\u2019 in an attempt to discover how useful these are. In just about every\ncase, such an approach has revealed shortcomings. While such concepts allow\nus to organize large amounts of data, they fail us too often to become the\nbuilding blocks of a comprehensive theory. For example, we cannot adequately\ndefine either language or dialect, nor can we infallibly distinguish the one from\nthe other.\nQuantification is another approach that has both its strengths and its weak-\nnesses. We can count instances of certain kinds of language use; we can devise\ntables, draw graphs, and show trends and correlations; we can even subject the\nresulting quantities to statistical analysis and claim significance for certain findings.\nI have referred to numbers and percentages throughout the preceding chapters,\nbut have made special reference to such matters in discussion of the linguistic\nvariable. Quantification is useful in showing what kinds of behavior you may\nexpect to find among groups of people and trends in that behavior acrossvarious\ndimensions such as time, space, gender, age, and social class. But any resulting\nclaims are claims about the behavior we can expect of groups, or of sub-groups.\nIn that respect they are statements about an idealized typical member, whoever\nhe or she might be. In actual fact, individuals are never typical, and certainly\ntheir behavior is never ideal by almost any criterion. What is interesting is\nthe particular fit between individuals and such idealizations, and especially the\nfundamental sociological puzzle of whether people model their behaviors on\ncertain ideals they perceive to exist or whether any ideals that people claim to\nexist are just idealizations arrived at through emphasizing similarities we believe\nto exist in people\u2019s behavior and down-playing differences. The approach through\nquantification is therefore not without a whole array of problems, ranging from\nvery simple issues such as collecting data, to profound ones having to do with\nthe nature of social reality.\nAITC16 384 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM Conclusion 385\nAn approach through language functions may also be indicated by the factthat\nlanguage is used for so many purposes. As we have seen, there are many ways\nof trying to deal with language function. We can try an ethnographic approach,\nwe can analyze conversations, we can attempt to distinguish what people do\nwith language as opposed to what they use language to say, as in a speech-acts\napproach, and so on. Much understanding of language use has been achieved\nby investigations conducted with such aims. Above all, though, they show how\nsubtle and varied are the differences that exist, yet how easily and confidently\nspeakers (and listeners) handle these subtleties.\nOne thing that our examination of various issues has revealed though is how\nimportant such concepts as \u2018identity,\u2019 \u2018class,\u2019 \u2018power,\u2019 \u2018solidarity,\u2019 \u2018politeness,\u2019\nand \u2018gender\u2019 are in trying to make sense of the data we find. Unfortunately, we\nhave no grand theory to unite these. Figueroa concludes her study of sociolin-\nguistic theory in general and specifically the ideas of Labov, Hymes, and Gumperz\nby saying (1994, p. 179), \u2018There is no unified theory of sociolinguistics, or even\nfor that matter, a shared metatheory. There is a shared sociolinguistic subject\nmatter \u2013 \u201cutterance\u201d \u2013 but this would not necessarily delimit sociolinguistics\nfrom other types of linguistics.\u2019\nSome sociolinguists insist on a narrow view. We may agree with Chambers\n(2003, pp. 273\u20134) that:\nwe have come to understand how variables function in vernacular and standard\ndialects. It is time now to go beyond that and ask why. Why do certain variables\nrecur in dialects all around the world? Why is it these particular variables, not\nothers, that persist? Why are they constrained in exactly the same ways in widely\nseparated communities? Why are they embedded so similarly in the social strata?\nHowever, his next sentence, \u2018This vast, virtually unexplored area lies at the very\nroot of our discipline,\u2019 might give us pause. Are there no other roots? Is that all\nsociolinguistics should be about?\nPerhaps the study of language in society is best served by resisting premature\nurges to declare that it must proceed along certain lines and may not proceed\nalong others. Repeatedly, we have seen the multi-dimensional nature of any\nissue we have looked at. Even when we took a uni-dimensional approach, we\ndid so knowing full well what we were doing and in the knowledge that another\napproach or other approaches might cast a different light on the issue. Although\npeople have long been interested in the relationships between language and\nsociety, it is only fairly recently that scientific approaches have been adopted.\nIt seems wiser to encourage a variety of scientific approaches and the genera-\ntion of a range of theories than to put our entire trust and hope into a single\nway of doing sociolinguistics. That is certainly the way I have gone about\nlooking at how language and society are related. I have not avoided theor-\netical issues, and I have not avoided looking at data themselves, and not simply\nin the sense that \u2018you cannot have data without a theory.\u2019 However, I have\nfound it neither useful nor possible to adopt a single theoretical approach.\nThis, I suggest, is also a correct characterization of current sociolinguistic\ninquiries; there are numerous theories, vast amounts of data, and important\nAITC16 385 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM 386 Conclusion\nfindings, but there is no central doctrine a sociolinguist must adhere to. In no\nway do I regard the absence of such a doctrine as a fatal flaw; rather, it should\nserve to encourage us to try to make new discoveries and find new areas to\nexplore in the hope of gaining a still better understanding of both language\nand society and of the many relationships between the two. Some of us may\neven be tempted then to try to change some of the relationships we find. I have\nsuggested we use caution if we are so tempted: ideology has too often proved\nto be a sure path to disaster!\nAITC16 386 5\/9\/05, 4:29 PM "}
