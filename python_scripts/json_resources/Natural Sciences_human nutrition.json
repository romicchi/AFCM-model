The CK-12 foundation defines a flexbook as a \u201cfree and open source\ntextbook platform where one can build and edit collaborative\ntextbooks1.\u201d The FNDH 400 (formerly the HN 400 flexbook,\ndepartment changed its name from Human Nutrition to Food,\nNutrition, Dietetics and Health) Flexbook fits this definition, but I\nfeel the name is particularly accurate due to the flexibility of Google\nDocs. Students in addition to having access through Google Docs,\ncan download the flexbook as an .odt, .pdf, .rtf, .doc, text, or html\nfile giving them flexibility to use the document how they would\nlike. Students can also choose whether they would like to read the\nflexbook digitally or print and read it on paper.\nThe flexbook is divided into 13 chapters with sections and\nsubsections. These are numbered in such a way that the first\nnumber represents the chapter. A period separates the chapter\nfrom the section number, and another period is followed by the\nsubsection number. The figures are non-copyrighted figures or I\nhave made them myself in PowerPoint. The flexbook also contains\nlinks to articles, videos, and animations in Web Link boxes.

Ideally on-campus students take the course\nduring the spring semester of their sophomore year. Most on-\ncampus students in the class are majoring in Nutritional Sciences,\nNutrition and Health (previously Public Health Nutrition), Nutrition\nand Kinesiology, Athletic Training, or Dietetics. There is an\nincreasing number of Biology, Life Sciences and other majors taking\nthe course. Online, more students are nontraditional and a little\nmore than half are distance dietetics students (K-State offers a\ndistance dietetics degree).\nAbout the Author/Instructor\nBrian Lindshield, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the\n2 | Human Nutrition Department of Food, Nutrition, Dietetics and Health.

This means that our understanding\nand practices are constantly changing and being updated. Some of\nnutrition\u2019s dynamic nature may be due to the fact that nutrition, as\na discipline, is relatively young (many vitamins weren\u2019t isolated until\nthe 1930s) compared to many other scientific fields. New research\nis always being conducted and the findings are continuously being\nreported to the public. With so much information, discernment\nmust be exercised. In order to interpret these new findings, you\nneed to understand how the research was conducted and the\nnutrition research hierarchy. Everyone eats, so people are going to\nface nutrition choices and questions on a daily basis. This section\nwill provide you with an integrated understanding of the different\nforms of nutrition research and how to evaluate them relative to one\nanother.\n1.1 The Basics\nNutrition can be defined as the science of the action of food,\nbeverages, and their components in biological systems. A nutrient is\na compound that provides a needed function in the body. Nutrients\ncan be further classified based on the amount needed in the body.\nMacronutrients: nutrients needed in larger amounts\nMicronutrients: nutrients needed in smaller amounts (but still\nimportant)\nThe following table lists the different macronutrients and\nmicronutrients.\nTable 1.11 Macronutrients and Micronutrients\nNutrition Basics | 9 Macronutrients Micronutrients\nCarbohydrates Vitamins\nProteins Minerals\nLipids\nWater\nCarbohydrates\nThe name carbohydrate means \u201chydrated carbon\u201d, or carbon with\nwater. Thus, it isn\u2019t a surprise that carbohydrates are made up of\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Sucrose (table sugar) is an example\nof a commonly consumed carbohydrate. Some dietary examples\nof carbohydrates are whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, rice, sugary\nsnacks/drinks, and pasta.\nFigure 1.11 Pancakes, a food source of carbohydrates\n10 | Human Nutrition Proteins\nProteins are also made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but\nthey also contain nitrogen. Several dietary sources of proteins\ninclude nuts, beans/legumes, skim milk, egg whites, and meat.\nFigure 1.12 Eggs, a food source of protein and lipid\nLipids\nLipids consist of fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and\nsterols (i.e. cholesterol). Lipids are also composed of carbon,\nhydrogen, and oxygen. Some dietary sources of lipids include oils,\nbutter, and egg yolks.\nNutrition Basics | 11 Figure 1.13 Butter, a food source of lipids\nWater\nWater is made up of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is the only\nmacronutrient that doesn\u2019t provide energy.\nVitamins\nCompounds that are essential for normal physiologic processes in\nthe body.\nMinerals\nElements (think periodic table) that are essential for normal\nphysiological processes in the body.\nNo References\n12 | Human Nutrition 1.11 Calories (Food Energy)\nFood energy is measured in kilocalories (kcals), commonly referred\nto as calories by the general public. The general public \u201ccalorie\u201d\nterm is incorrect (most do not know or understand the difference\nbetween the kilocalorie and calorie terms), but it is important to\nunderstand how what the term calorie represents when it is used\nin this way. A kilocalorie is the amount of energy needed to raise\n1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius. A food\u2019s kilocalories are\ndetermined by putting the food into a bomb calorimeter and\ndetermining the energy output (energy = heat produced). The first\nlink below is to an image of a bomb calorimeter and a link to a video\nshowing how one is used.\nWeb Links\nBomb Calorimeter (inactive link as of 05/18/2021)\nVideo: Bomb Calorimetry (2:19)\nAmong the nutrients, the amount of kilocalories per gram that each\nprovide are shown below.\nEnergy (kcal/g) No Energy\nCarbohydrates (4) Vitamins\nProteins (4) Minerals\nLipids (9) Water\nAs can be seen, only carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids provide\nenergy. However, there is another energy source in the diet that\nis not a nutrient\u2026\u2026alcohol. Just to re-emphasize, alcohol is NOT a\nnutrient! But it does provide energy.\nNutrition Basics | 13 Figure 1.112 Wine is a\ntype of alcohol.\nThe following table lists the energy sources in the diet from lowest\ncalories per gram to the highest calories per gram. Knowing these\nnumbers allows a person to calculate/estimate the amount of\ncalories the food contains if you know the grams of the different\nenergy sources.\nEnergy Sources (kcal/g)\nCarbohydrates \u2192 4\nProtein \u2192 4\nAlcohol \u2192 7\nLipids \u2192 9\nLinks\nBomb Calorimeter \u2013 https://www.learner.org/courses/\nchemistry/text/\n14 | Human Nutrition text.html?dis=U&num=Ym5WdElUQS9PQ289&sec=YzJWaklUQS9Oe\nW89 (inactive link as of 05/18/21)\nBomb Calorimetry \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=ohyA9amFfsc\n1.12 Phytochemicals, Zoochemicals & Functional\nFoods\nBeyond macronutrients and micronutrients, there is a lot of interest\nin non-nutritive compounds found in foods that may be either\nbeneficial or detrimental to health.\nPhytochemicals\nFigure 1.121 Tomatoes and other plants contain\nphytochemicals.\nNutrition Basics | 15 Phytochemicals are compounds in plants (phyto) that are believed\nto provide healthy benefits beyond the traditional nutrients. One\nexample is lycopene in tomatoes, which is thought to potentially\ndecrease the risk of some cancers (in particular prostate cancer).\nDiets rich in fruits and vegetables have been associated with\ndecreased risk of chronic diseases. Many fruits and vegetables are\nrich in phytochemicals, leading some to hypothesize that\nphytochemicals are responsible for the decreased risk of chronic\ndiseases. The role that phytochemicals play in health is still in the\nearly stages of research, relative to other areas of nutrition such as\nmicronutrients. The following 2 links contain good information on\nphytonutrients if you are interested in learning more about them.\nWeb Link\nLinus Pauling Institute: Phytochemicals\nZoochemicals\nZoochemicals are the animal equivalent of phytochemicals in\nplants. They are compounds in animals that are believed to provide\nhealth benefits beyond the traditional nutrients that food contains.\nHopefully the name is pretty easy to remember because you can\nfind animals at a zoo. Some compounds can be both phytochemicals\nand zoochemicals. An example of compounds that can be classified\nas both are the yellow carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. Kale,\nspinach, and corn contain phytochemicals and are good sources of\nlutein and zeaxanthin. Whereas egg yolks contain zoochemicals and\nare also a good source of these carotenoids.\nFunctional Foods\nThere are a number of definitions of functional foods. Functional\nfoods are generally understood to be a food, or a food ingredient,\nthat may provide a health benefit beyond the traditional nutrients\n(macronutrients and micronutrients) it contains. Functional foods\nare often a rich source of a phytochemical or zoochemical, or\ncontain more of a certain nutrient than a normal food.\nLinks\n16 | Human Nutrition Linus Pauling Institute: Phytochemicals \u2013\nhttp://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/phytochemicals.html\n1.13 The Scientific Method\nThe basis of what we know about nutrition is derived from research\nand the scientific method underlies how research is conducted. The\nfollowing figure shows the steps in the scientific method.\nFigure 1.131 The scientific method\nNutrition Basics | 17 Steps in the Scientific Method\n1. The first step is to come up with a scientific or research\nquestion that you are interested in investigating.\n2. Based on your research question, a hypothesis or an educated\nguess is formulated.\n3. The next step is to design and conduct the experiment. A good\ndesign should take into account what has been done\npreviously. Thus, a thorough review of methods and results\npublished previously should be undertaken. This will help\nprevent making the same mistakes and save a lot of time\nconducting the research.\n4. Perform the experiment/research and collect results and draw\nconclusions.\n5. If the hypothesis is not supported, then a new hypothesis/\nresearch question should be created and a new experiment be\nconducted.\n6. Ultimately, researchers hope to publish their research in peer-\nreviewed journals.\nNo References\n1.2 Epidemiology\nEpidemiology is defined as the study of human populations. These\nstudies often investigate the relationship between dietary\nconsumption and disease development. There are three main types\nof epidemiological studies: cross-sectional, case-control, and\nprospective cohort studies.\n18 | Human Nutrition Figure 1.21 Types of epidemiology (Adapted from Levin[footnote]Levin K.\n(2006) Study design III: Cross-sectional studies. Evidence - Based Dentistry\n7(1): 24.[/footnote])\n1. Cross-Sectional Studies\nCross-sectional studies compare different populations at the\nsame point in time. It is as if you take a snapshot of the two different\npopulations to compare them to one another. An example of a\ncross-sectional study led to a phenomenon known as the \u201cFrench\nParadox.\u201d Cholesterol and saturated fat intake were associated with\nincreased risk of coronary heart disease across a wide variety of\ncountries. However, within the study they noticed a surprising\nresult. European countries with very similar cholesterol-saturated\nfat intakes had hugely different death rates from coronary heart\ndisease deaths, as shown below.\nNutrition Basics | 19 Figure 1.22 An example of a cross-sectional study, \u201cThe \u201cFrench Paradox\u201d. The\nx-axis shows four different European countries with similar\ncholesterol-saturated fat intakes[footnote]Artaud-Wild SM, Connor SL,\nSexton G, Connor WE. (1993) Differences in coronary mortality can be\nexplained by differences in cholesterol and saturated fat intakes in 40\ncountries but not in france and finland. A paradox. Circulation 88(6):\n2771.[\\footnote] (the numbers shown within the bars), and the y-axis\nrepresents coronary heart disease rate.\nThe French had a 5-fold lower risk of dying from coronary heart\ndisease than the Finns, despite having similar cholesterol-saturated\n1\nfat intakes .\n1. Artaud-Wild SM, Connor SL, Sexton G, Connor WE.\n(1993) Differences in coronary mortality can be\nexplained by differences in cholesterol and saturated fat\nintakes in 40 countries but not in france and finland. A\nparadox. Circulation 88(6): 2771.[\\footnote]. A paradox\nmeans something contradictory, which this finding\nseemed to be. The \"French Paradox\" has led to research\n20 | Human Nutrition 2. Case-Control Studies\nCase-control studies look at a group of cases (e.g. people with a\ndisease) vs. controls (e.g. people without the disease). Most case-\ncontrol studies are retrospective (looking back in time, or looking at\nthe past). These studies try to determine if there were differences\nin the diets of the cases compared to controls in the past. Cases\nand controls are matched on characteristics such as age, sex, BMI,\nhistory of disease, and many others. This means researchers try to\nchoose a control that has similar characteristics to the case. The\nresearchers then compare the exposure levels between the cases\nand controls, as shown below. In this example a greater proportion\nof diseased (cases) individuals than disease-free individuals\n(controls) were exposed to something.\non red wine, and one of its active components,\nresveratrol, because the French consume a lot of this\nalcoholic beverage. Cross-sectional studies are\nconsidered the weakest type of epidemiology because\nthey are based only on group outcomes. This may lead\npeople to believe that members of the group have\ncharacteristics, which as individuals they do not. This is\nknown as ecologic (another name that is used to refer to\nthis type of study) fallacy, and is a limitation of cross-\nsectional studies[footnote]Gordis L. (2004)\nEpidemiology. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Saunders.\nNutrition Basics | 21 Figure 1.23 An example of a case-control study in which the diseased were\nmore likely to have been exposed than those who were disease-free. Cases are\nrepresented by the red box on the left, and the controls are the green box on\nthe right (Adapted from Gordis[footnote]Gordis L. (2004) Epidemiology.\nPhiladelphia, PA: Elsevier Saunders.[/footnote]).\nUsing trans-fat intake as the exposure, and cardiovascular disease\nas the disease, the figure would be expected to look like this:\nFigure 1.24 An example of a case-control study that indicates that more cases\nhad high trans-fat intake compared to the controls.\nTo determine people's intakes of foods and food components, food\n22 | Human Nutrition frequency questionnaires are commonly used. As the name\nsuggests, a food frequency questionnaire is a series of questions\nthat determines how frequently you consume a certain food. An\nexample of a question on a food frequency questionnaire is shown\nbelow:\n\"Over the past 12 months, how often did you drink milk?\"\nNever\n1 time/month less 1 time/day\n2-3 times/month 2-3 times/day\n1-2 times/week 4-5 times/day\n3-4 times/week 6 or more times/day\n5-6 times/week\nAn example of a food frequency questionnaire is shown in the link\nbelow.\nWeb Link\nNHANES Food Frequency Questionnaire\n3. Prospective Cohort Studies\nA cohort is \"a group of subjects.\" Most cohort studies are\nprospective. Initial information is collected (usually by food\nfrequency questionnaires) on the intake of a cohort of people at\nbaseline, or the beginning. This cohort is then followed over time\n(normally many years) to quantify health outcomes of the individual\nwithin it. Cohort studies are normally considered to be more robust\nthan case-control studies, because these studies do not start with\ndiseased people and normally do not require people to remember\ntheir dietary habits in the distant past or before they developed a\ndisease. An example of a prospective cohort study would be if you\nfilled out a questionnaire on your current dietary habits and are\nthen followed into the future to see if you develop osteoporosis. As\nshown below, instead of separating based on disease versus disease-\nfree, individuals are separated based on exposure. In this example,\nNutrition Basics | 23 those who are exposed are more likely to be diseased than those\nwho were not exposed.\nFigure 1.25 An example of cohort study in which those exposed are more likely\nto develop the disease. (Adapted from Gordis[footnote]Gordis L. (2004)\nEpidemiology. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Saunders.[/footnote])\nUsing trans-fat intake again as the exposure and cardiovascular\ndisease as the disease, the figure would be expected to look like this:\nFigure 1.26 An example of a cohort study where higher trans-fat intake is\nassociated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease\n24 | Human Nutrition There are several well known examples of prospective cohorts\u2019\nstudies:\nFramingham Heart Study\nThe Framingham Heart Study started in 1948 and has been\nfollowing the residents of Framingham, Massachusetts to identify\nrisk factors for heart disease. This cohort has been very fruitful\nin finding a number of important factors associated with coronary\nheart disease. In 2002, a third generation of participants was\nenrolled to be followed. The following links show more about the\nFramingham Heart Study.\nWeb Links\nFramingham Heart Study History (inactive link as of 05/18/2021)\nFramingham Heart Study Research Milestones (inactive link as of 05/\n18/2021)\nNurses Health Study\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study started in 1976 and enrolled 122,000\nfemale nurses. Every 4 years they received a food frequency\nquestionnaire to assess their dietary habits.\nWeb Link\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study\nHealth Professionals Follow-Up Study\nThe Health Professionals Follow-Up Study started in 1986 and\nenrolled 51,529 male health professionals (dentists, pharmacists,\noptometrists, osteopathic physicians, podiatrists, and\nveterinarians). Every 4 years they received a food frequency\nquestionnaire to assess their dietary habits.\nWeb Link\nHealth Professionals Follow-up Study\nThe Health Professionals Follow-Up Study is a good example for\nNutrition Basics | 25 how cohort studies can be important in nutrition research. We\nwill consider one example in which the researchers administered\nfood frequency questionnaires that contained 131 food and beverage\nitems to determine whether their intake was associated with\nincreased or decreased risk of developing prostate cancer. Of these\nitems, intake of four foods (tomatoes, tomato sauce, pizza, and\nstrawberries) were associated with decreased incidence of prostate\n2\ncancer, as illustrated in the figure below .\n2.

In vitro\nmeans \"within glass\", so these methods are performed within flasks,\ndishes, plates, and test tubes, although most of these are no longer\nglass (mostly plastic now). These studies are performed outside of a\nliving organism, so the results need to be interpreted with this fact\nin mind.\nOne common form of in vitro research is cell culture. This\ninvolves growing cells in flasks and dishes. In order for cells to grow\nthey need a nutrient source. For cell culture the nutrient source\nis referred to as media. Media supplies nutrients to the cells in\nvitro similarly to how blood performs this function within the body.\nMost cells adhere to the bottom of the flask and are so small that a\nmicroscope is needed to see them.\nCells are only handled inside a biosafety cabinet (aka cell culture\nhood). The hood is sterile and protects the cells from the outside\nenvironment. The cells need to be protected because they do not\nhave human skin as a barrier to keep microorganisms, etc., from\ncontaminating them.\n28 | Human Nutrition Figure 1.32 Flask containing media and cells (left); biosafety cabinet (cell\nculture hood, right)\nCells are grown inside an incubator, which is a device that provides\nthe optimal temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2)\nconcentrations for cells and microorganisms. By imitating the\nbody's temperature and CO2 levels (37 degrees Celsius, 5% CO2),\nthe incubator allows cells to grow even though they are outside the\nbody.\nFigure 1.33 Outside and inside of an incubator\nAnimal Studies\nAnimal studies are one form of in vivo research, which translates\nto \"within the living\". Rats and mice are the most common animals\nused in nutrition research.\nWhy do animal research?\nNutrition Basics | 29 Animals can be used in research that would be unethical to\nconduct in humans. Researchers can make sure that a certain\nregimen is safe before it is researched in humans. One advantage\nof animal dietary studies is that researchers can control exactly\nwhat the animals eat. In human studies, researchers can tell subjects\nwhat to eat and provide them with the food, but that does not\nnecessarily mean that they are going to consume exactly what they\nare supposed to. Also people are not great at estimating, recording,\nor reporting how much or what they eat/ate. Animal studies are\nalso, normally, far less expensive than human studies.\nThere are some important factors to keep in mind when\ninterpreting animal research. First, an animal\u2019s metabolism and\nphysiology is different than humans. As a result, animals' absorption\nand bioavailability of compounds can differ from humans.\nFurthermore, animal models of disease (cancer, cardiovascular\ndisease, etc.), although similar, are different from the human\ndisease. So these factors have to be considered when interpreting\nresults from this type of research. Nevertheless, animal studies have\nbeen, and continue to be, important for nutrition research.\nNo References\n1.4 Human Intervention Studies/Clinical\nTrials\nThere are a variety of human intervention study designs in nutrition\nresearch, but the most common, especially in pharmaceutical/\nmedical research, is the clinical trial. A clinical trial is a scientifically\ncontrolled study using consenting people to find the safety and\neffectiveness of different items/regimens. Clinical trials are the\n\"gold standard\" research method. Their findings carry the most\nweight when making decisions about a certain research area\nbecause they are the most rigorous scientific studies. Every\n30 | Human Nutrition pharmaceutical must go through a series of clinical trials before\nbeing approved for the market by the FDA (specifically the\nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments). As\nshown in the figure below, human intervention studies/clinical\ntrials are normally prospective. By the end of this section you should\nhave an understanding of what randomized, double-blind, and\nplacebo-controlled means.\nFigure 1.41 Clinical trials are prospective (Adapted from Levin[footnote]Levin\nK. (2006) Study design III: Cross-sectional studies. Evidence - Based Dentistry\n7(1): 24.[/footnote])\nNutrition Basics | 31 Placebo and The Placebo Effect\nA placebo is a fake pill or treatment that serves as a comparison\nto an active treatment. An examples of placebos are shown below.\nFigure 1.42 Placebo\npills[footnote]http://en.wikipedia.org/\nwiki/File:Cebocap.jpg[/footnote]\nThe use of a placebo is necessary in medical research because of\na phenomenon known as the \"placebo effect\". The placebo effect\nresults from a subject's belief in a treatment, even though there is\nactually no treatment being administered. An example would be an\nathlete who consumes a sports drink a\nnd runs the 100 meter dash in 11.00 seconds. The athlete then,\nunder the exact same conditions, drinks what he is told is \"Super\nDuper Sports Drink\" and runs the 100 meter dash in 10.50 seconds.\nBut what the athlete didn't know was that Super Duper Sports Drink\nwas the Sports Drink + Food Coloring. There was nothing different\nbetween the drinks, but the athlete believed that the \"Super Duper\n32 | Human Nutrition Sports Drink\" was going to help him run faster, so he did. This\nimprovement is due to the placebo effect.\nFigure 1.43 Placebo effect example\nIronically, a study similar to the example given above has been\nconducted and its results support that there is a \u201cplacebo effect.\u201d\nWeb Link\nA Placebo Can Make You Run Faster\nRandomization\nRandomization is the process of randomly assigning subjects to\ngroups to decrease bias. Bias, according to the Merriam-Webster\ndictionary, is \"a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing\n3\nby selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others \".\nBias can occur in assigning subjects to groups in a way that will\n3. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bias\nNutrition Basics | 33 influence the results. An example of bias in a study of an\nantidepressant drug is shown below. In this nonrandomized\nantidepressant drug example, researchers (who know what the\nsubjects are receiving) put depressed subjects into the placebo\ngroup, while \"less depressed\" subjects are put into the\nantidepressant drug group. As a result, even if the drug isn't\neffective, the group assignment may make the drug appear effective,\nthus biasing the results as shown below.\nFigure 1.44 Non-randomized antidepressant drug example\nThis is a bit of an extreme example, but even if the researchers are\ntrying to prevent bias, sometimes bias can still occur. However, if\nthe subjects are randomized, the sick and the healthy people will\nideally be equally distributed between the groups. Thus, the trial will\nbe unbiased and a true test of whether or not the drug is effective.\n34 | Human Nutrition Figure 1.45 Randomized antidepressant drug example\nBlinding\nBlinding is a technique to prevent bias in human intervention\nstudies. A study without blinding is referred to as \"open label\"\nbecause both the subject and the researchers know what treatment\nthe subject is receiving (i.e. placebo or drug). This can lead to bias,\nso these types of trials are used less frequently.\nNutrition Basics | 35 Figure 1.46 In an open-label study, both the subject and researcher know what\ntreatment the subject is receiving.\nIn a single-blind study, the researcher knows what treatment the\nsubject is receiving, but the subject does not. If the subjects are\nrandomized, these types of trials should produce robust results, but\nit is still possible that the researcher can bias the results.\n36 | Human Nutrition Figure 1.47 In a single-blind study, the researcher knows what treatment the\nsubject is receiving, but the subject does not.\nFinally there is the double-blind study, where neither the researcher\nnor the subject know what treatment the subject is receiving. A\nseparate board reviews the collected results and decides the fate\nof the trial. This is the \"gold standard\" because it prevents observer\nbias from occurring.\nNutrition Basics | 37 Figure 1.48 In a double-blind study, neither the subject nor the researcher\nknow what treatment the subject is receiving.\nThe following video does a nice job explaining and illustrating how\ndouble-blind randomized trials are performed.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Double-blind clinical trial (1:40)\nLink\nA placebo can make you run faster -\nhttp://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/a-placebo-can-make-\nyou-run-faster/\nVideo\nHow double-blind randomized controlled trials are done -\n38 | Human Nutrition http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x12igoz_double-blind-\nclinical-trials_news\n1.5 Nutrition Research Statistics\nOne important aspect in being able to interpret research is to have\na basic understanding of statistical significance. Statistical\nsignificance means that there is sufficient statistical evidence to\nsuggest that the results are most likely not due to chance.\nStatistical significance is represented by p-values in most\nresearch. The p-value is an estimate of whether the difference is\na statistical accident or due to random chance. A p-value of less\nthan 0.05 (commonly written p-value <0.05 or p <0.05) is used in\nmost cases to indicate statistical significance. This value means that\n5% of the time the statistical results are accidental or not true.\nResearchers accept this level of uncertainty.\nEpidemiological research usually uses different statistics to\nanalyze their results. Epidemiological results are commonly\nreported as odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs), or hazard ratios\n(HRs). These values can be interpreted similarly regardless of which\nis used. For example, the odds ratio represents the odds of a certain\nevent occurring (often a disease) in response to a certain exposure\n(in nutrition this is often a food or dietary compound). In a paper it\nis common to see one of these measures in this form: OR = 2.0. What\ndoes this mean? As shown below, an OR, RR, or HR of 1 means that\nexposure is associated with neither increased nor decreased risk\n(neutral). If an OR, RR or HR is less than 1, that exposure is associated\nwith a decreased risk. If an OR, RR, or HR is greater than 1, that\nexposure is associated with an increased risk. An OR,RR, or HR of 2\nmeans there is twice the risk, while an OR, RR, or HR of 0.5 means\nthere is half the risk of the exposure versus the comparison group.\nNutrition Basics | 39 Figure 1.51 Risk in relation to exposure for OR, RR, or HR\nTo determine whether OR, RR, and HR are significantly different\nfor a given exposure, most epidemiological research uses 95%\nconfidence intervals. Confidence intervals indicate the estimated\nrange that the measure is calculated to include. They go below and\nabove the OR, RR, and HR itself. It is a calculation of how confident\nthe researchers are that the OR, RR, and HR value is correct. Thus:\nLarge Confidence Intervals = Less Confidence in Value\nSmall Confidence Intervals = More Confidence in Value\nThus, 95% confidence intervals indicate that researchers are 95%\nconfident that the true value is within the confidence intervals. A\nconfidence interval is normally written in parenthesis following the\nOR, RR, or HR or represented as bars in a figure as shown below.\n40 | Human Nutrition Figure 1.52 Confidence Intervals for OR, RR, or HRs in text form (left) and\nfigure form (right)\nMost of the time, the OR, RR, or HR will be found in the middle of\nthe 95% confidence interval, but not necessarily all of the time. For\ninstance, there could be much greater confidence that the value is\nnot much lower than the OR, RR, or HR, but not much confidence\nthat the value does not exceed the HR, RR, or HR. This could lead to\nconfidence interval looking skewed above the OR, RR, or HR (more\nconfidence interval above, than below, the OR, RR, or HR).\nIf the 95% confidence intervals of the OR, RR, or HR does not\ninclude or overlap 1, then the value is significant. If the 95%\nconfidence intervals include or overlap 1, then the OR, RR, or HR is\nnot significant, because it is possible the the true value is 1, which is\nneutral, and can not be significantly different than 1.\nNutrition Basics | 41 Figure 1.53 Confidence intervals (95%) that include 1 indicate that the value is\nnot significantly different. Confidence intervals above or below 1 without\nincluding it indicate that the value is significantly different.\n1.7 Interpreting Research\nNow that you are familiar with the different forms of nutrition\nresearch, the next step is understanding how to interpret and\nsynthesize the information. To synthesize information on a certain\ntopic, the two most popular methods are meta-analyses and\nsystematic literature reviews. While there are differences between\nthese two methods, they are similar overall in that they aim to draw\na conclusion from the body of research evidence rather than from\none study. We will focus on systematic literature reviews because of\ntheir rising popularity in biomedical literature.\nA systematic literature review does what the name implies, it\nsystematically reviews the literature related to a certain research\nquestion. For example, the research question might be, \"Does\nchocolate decrease blood pressure?\" There is a method for\n42 | Human Nutrition performing the review established ahead of time that details\nanswers to questions such as:\nHow will journal articles be identified?\nUsing what databases?\nWhat search terms will be used?\nThe end product is a conclusion based on the evidence in the\nidentified journal articles. A person in the following video compares\nit to reading Consumer Reviews or a consumer report about\nsomething that you are going to buy. The Cochrane Collaboration\nperforms many systematic reviews; the first link is to a video about\nthe Cochrane Collaboration, the second is a link to the site itself.\nWeb Links\nVideo: The Cochrane Collaboration - 1st 3 minutes (7:11)\nThe Cochrane Collaboration\nBecause they synthesize the findings from multiple trials,\nsystematic literature reviews are considered the highest level of\nnutrition research evidence and are therefore shown at the top of\nthe strength of nutrition research pyramid below. In vitro studies\nare shown at the bottom of the triangle because they are the\nweakest form of evidence overall. It should be pointed out that most\nsystematic literature reviews only consider epidemiological studies\nand clinical trials and do not include animal studies or in vitro\nevidence. While these studies are of less strength, they should still\nbe considered.\nNutrition Basics | 43 Figure 1.71 Strength of scientific research, a higher position on the pyramid\nmean greater strength of that form of evidence.\nThere are a couple of other factors to consider relating to the\ndifferent forms of research. First, epidemiological studies cannot\nshow causality (i.e. smoking causes lung cancer), but instead\nidentify relationships or associations (i.e. smoking is associated with\nlung cancer occurrence). Clinical trials/human studies are the best\nform of primary research because their findings should be directly\ntranslatable to patients. So why use other forms of research? The\ndescription below should help explain why the other forms of\nresearch are also important.\nIn general, a certain sequence of studies in nutrition research is\noften followed as shown in the figure below.\n44 | Human Nutrition Figure 1.72 The progression of nutrition research. The shape indicates the\nselection of the most promising and safest hypotheses being moved to the next\nlevel. Thus, there is a decrease in the overall number of hypotheses\nrepresented by the height of the figure) being investigated by the next form of\nresearch.\nEpidemiological studies find relationships between food/food\ncomponents and a specific health outcome. This relationship is then\ninvestigated by in vitro studies and then, some of the most\npromising move to animal studies. Then the most promising and\nsafe food/food components are moved into clinical trials/human\nstudies. If it is an individual compound, there will be smaller trials\ndesigned to see if the compound is safe before it is moved into\nlarger clinical trials to determine whether the food/food\ncomponent results in beneficial health outcomes. The overall effect\nof this process is to select the most promising and safe food/food\ncomponents for the clinical trials/human studies. This allows time\nand money to be used more efficiently, because while clinical trials/\nNutrition Basics | 45 human studies are the best form of research, they are also normally\nthe most expensive and time-consuming.\nResearchers nevertheless have been tempted to skip directly to\nclinical trials in the past rather than following the research\nprogression. To illustrate what happens in these situations, the\nfollowing describes a couple of examples when \"normal\" research\nprogression hasn't been followed.\nBeta-Carotene and Lung Cancer\nIn the early 1980s there was a lot of excitement among\nresearchers over the epidemiological evidence showing that higher\ndietary consumption of the carotenoid, beta-carotene, decreased\n4\nlung cancer risk . By the mid 1980\u2019s, two large, randomized,\nplacebo-controlled trials began to determine whether high-dose\n\u03b2-carotene supplementation (far higher than dietary intake) could\ndecrease lung cancer incidence in high-risk populations before in\nvitro or animal studies had investigated this relationship. The\nresearch community was shocked when these two studies were\nterminated early in the mid 1990s because of significant increases\nin lung cancer incidence among smokers receiving \u03b2-carotene\n56\nsupplements , . In vitro and animal studies completed after the\n4. Peto R, Doll R, Buckley JD, Sporn MB. Can dietary beta-\ncarotene materially reduce human cancer rates? Nature\n290, 201-208, 1981.\n5.

The beta-carotene and\nretinol efficacy trial: Incidence of lung cancer and\n46 | Human Nutrition clinical trial found that as \u03b2-carotene intake shifts from normal\ndietary levels to high, supplement-type levels, the effect on lung\ncancer development also shifts from beneficial to detrimental in\n7\ncombination with smoke or carcinogen exposure . Thus, if the\nnormal research progression had been followed, it is likely that\na lower dose of beta-carotene would have been used or trials\nwouldn't have been undertaken at all.\nSelenium, Vitamin E, and Prostate Cancer\nAnother example of when the research progression was not\nfollowed was the relationship between selenium, vitamin E, and\nprostate cancer. Two clinical trials had found secondary results\nthat suggested that selenium and vitamin E supplementation may\n89\ndecrease prostate cancer risk , .

Rather\nthan examining the relationship using in vitro and animal studies, a\nclinical trial was undertaken to determine if selenium and vitamin\nE supplementation alone, or in combination, could decrease the\n10\ndevelopment of prostate cancer incidence . This clinical trial was\nalso terminated early because of a nonsignificant increase in\n11\nprostate cancer in those receiving vitamin E , and a nonsignificant\n12\nincrease in diabetes among those receiving selenium . In vitro\nstudies and animal models performed since the clinical trial was\nundertaken and after its termination suggest that vitamin E is not\neffective and that another form of selenium could have possibly\n13\nbeen more effective .\n10.

Lindshield, B.L., Ford, N.A., Canene-Adams, K., Diamond\n48 | Human Nutrition In addition to the lessons learned about the sequence of research\nin nutrition, these studies add to growing evidence that suggests\nthat single-agent interventions, even in combination, may not be\nan effective strategy for improving health. The common nutrition\nresearch approach, after epidemiology finds an association or\nrelationship, is to use in vitro and animal studies to identify the\nspecific compound in a certain food that is responsible. This has\nbeen termed the reductionist approach because it takes something\ncomplex (food) and reduces it down to its simpler components.\nHowever, there is growing evidence that this may be a flawed\napproach. Some nutrition researchers feel that more focus should\nbe on the food itself, rather than trying to discern exactly what is\nresponsible for the beneficial health outcomes. Because it may not\nbe one or 2 compounds alone that are responsible for the effect,\nit might be difficult to determine from the multitude of nutrients\nin foods which are responsible for the beneficial effect. This will\nmean changes in the overall research approach, especially at the\nhuman intervention studies/clinical trials level, because in most\n1415\ncases there is not a way to give a \u201cplacebo food\u201d , .\nLinks\nA.M., Wallig, M.A., Erdman, J.W., Jr. Selenium, but not\nlycopene or vitamin E, decreases growth of\ntransplantable Dunning R3327-H rat prostate tumors.\nPLoS One. 2010.\n14.

This chapter\ngoes more in depth about these major dietary components.\nSections:\n2.1 Carbohydrates\n2.2 Proteins\n2.3 Lipids\n2.1 Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates have become surprisingly divisive. Some people\nswear by them, others swear against them. But it is important to\nunderstand that carbohydrates are a diverse group of compounds\nthat have a multitude of effects in the body. Thus, trying to make\nblanket statements about carbohydrates is probably not a good idea.\nCarbohydrates are named because they are hydrated (as in water,\nH2O) carbon. Below is the formula showing how carbon dioxide\n(CO2) and water (H2O) are used to make carbohydrates (CH2O)n and\noxygen (O2). The \u201cn\u201d after the carbohydrate in the formula indicates\nthat the chemical formula is repeated an unknown number of times,\nbut that for every carbon and oxygen, there will always be two\nhydrogens.\n\\begin{equation}\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 51 \\ce{CO2 + H2O \\to (CH2O)_n + O2}\n\\end{equation}\nCarbohydrates are produced by plants through a process known\nas photosynthesis. In this process, plants use the energy from\nphotons of light to synthesize carbohydrates. The formula for this\nreaction looks like this:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\ce{6CO2 + 6H2O + Light \\to C6H12O6 + 6O2}\n\\end{equation}\nThere are many different types of carbohydrates as shown in the\nfigure below. The first way that carbohydrates can be divided is into\nsimple, complex, and sugar alcohols. As the names imply, complex\ncarbohydrates contain more sugar units, while simple\ncarbohydrates contain either 1 or 2 sugars. In the next sections, you\nwill learn more about the different forms of carbohydrates.\nFigure 2.11 The different forms of carbohydrates\nSubsections:\n2.11 Simple Carbohydrates\n52 | Human Nutrition 2.12 Alternative Sweeteners\n2.13 Oligosaccharides\n2.14 Polysaccharides\nNo References\n2.11 Simple Carbohydrates\nAs shown in the figure below, simple carbohydrates can be further\ndivided into monosaccharides and disaccharides. Mono- means\none, thus monosaccharides contain one sugar. Di- means two, thus\ndisaccharides contain 2 sugar units.\nFigure 2.111 Overview of Carbohydrates\nMonosaccharides\nThe 3 monosaccharides are: glucose, fructose and galactose.\nNotice that all are 6-carbon sugars (hexoses). However, fructose has\na five member ring, while glucose and galactose have 6 member\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 53 rings. Also notice that the only structural difference between\nglucose and galactose is the position of the alcohol (OH) group that\nis shown in red.\nFigure 2.112 The 3 monosaccharides\nGlucose \u2013 Product of photosynthesis, major source of energy in our\nbodies\nFructose \u2013 Commonly found in fruits and used commercially in\nmany beverages\nGalactose \u2013 Not normally found in nature alone, normally found\nin the disaccharide lactose\nWeb Link\nNot familiar with ring structures, see how glucose forms a ring\nDisaccharides\nDisaccharides are produced from 2 monosaccharides. The\ncommonly occurring disaccharides are:\nMaltose (glucose + glucose, aka malt sugar) \u2013 seldom found in\nfoods, present in alcoholic beverages and barley\nSucrose (glucose + fructose, aka table sugar) \u2013 only made by\nplants.\nLactose (galactose + glucose, aka milk sugar) \u2013 primary milk sugar\n54 | Human Nutrition The different disaccharides and the monosaccharides\ncomponents are illustrated below.\nFigure 2.113 The 3 disaccharides\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 55 Each of these disaccharides contains glucose and all the reactions\nare dehydration reactions. Also notice the difference in the bond\nstructures. Maltose and sucrose have alpha-bonds, which are\ndepicted as v-shaped above. You might hear the term glycosidic\nused in some places to describe bonds between sugars. A glycoside\nis a sugar, so glycosidic is referring to a sugar bond. Lactose, on\nthe other hand, contains a beta-bond. We need a special enzyme,\nlactase, to break this bond, and the absence of lactase activity leads\nto lactose intolerance.\nHigh-Fructose Corn Syrup\nFood manufacturers are always searching for cheaper ways to\nproduce their food. One method that has been popular is the use\nof high-fructose corn syrup as an alternative to sucrose. High-\nfructose corn syrup contains either 42 or 55% fructose, which is\nsimilar to sucrose1. Nevertheless, because an increase in high-\nfructose corn syrup consumption (see figure below) has coincided\nwith the increase in obesity in the U.S., there is a lot of controversy\nsurrounding its use.\nFigure 2.114 U.S. per capita sugar and sweetener consumption2\n56 | Human Nutrition Opponents claim that high-fructose corn syrup is contributing to\nthe rise in obesity rates. As a result, some manufactures have\nstarted releasing products made with natural sugar. You can read\nabout this trend in the following New York Times article in the\nlink below. Also, manufacturers tried to rebrand high-fructose corn\nsyrup as corn sugar to get around the negative perception of the\nname. But the FDA rejected the Corn Refiners Association request to\nchange the name officially to corn sugar as described in the second\nlink.

We will first\nconsider sugar alcohols and then the alternative sweeteners in\nsubsequent sections.\nBelow you can see the structure of three common sugar alcohols:\nxylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol.\nFigure 2.121 Structure of three commonly used sugar alcohols: xylitol, sorbitol,\nand mannitol1-3\nRemember that alcohol subgroups are (OH), and you can see many\nof them in these structures.\nSugar alcohols are also known as \u201csugar replacers\u201d, because some\nin the public might get confused by the name sugar alcohol. Some\nmight think a sugar alcohol is a sweet alcoholic beverage. Another\nname for them is nutritive sweeteners, which indicates that they do\nprovide calories. Sugar alcohols are nearly as sweet as sucrose but\nonly provide approximately half the calories as shown below. The\nname polyols also seems to be increasingly used to describe these\ncompounds.\nTable 2.121 Relative sweetness of monosaccharides, disaccharides,\nand sugar alcohols4,5\n58 | Human Nutrition Sweetener Relative Sweetness Energy (kcal/g)\nLactose 0.2 4*\nMaltose 0.4 4\nGlucose 0.7 4\nSucrose 1.0 4\nFructose 1.2-1.8 4\nErythritol 0.7 0.4\nIsomalt 0.5 2.0\nLactitol 0.4 2.0\n*Differs based on a person\u2019s lactase activity\nSugars are fermented by bacteria on the surfaces of teeth. This\nresults in a decreased pH (higher acidity) that leads to tooth decay\nand, potentially, cavity formation. The major advantage of sugar\nalcohols over sugars is that sugar alcohols are not fermented by\nbacteria on the tooth surface. There is a nice picture of this process\nin the link below as well as a video explaining the process of tooth\ndecay.\nWeb Links\nSugar and Dental Caries\nVideo: Tooth Decay (1:06)\nWhile not a sugar alcohol, tagatose is very similar to sugar alcohols.\nTagatose is an isomer of fructose, that provides a small amount\nof energy (1.5 kcal/g). 80% of tagatose reaches the large intestine,\nwhere it is fermented by bacteria, meaning it has a prebiotic-type\neffect4. Notice the similarity in structure of tagatose to sugar\nalcohols, the only difference being a ketone (=O) instead of an\nalcohol (OH) group.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 59 Figure 2.122 Structure of tagatose11\nReferences & Links\n1. https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/\nxylitol#section=Top\n2. https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/D-\nSorbitol#section=Top\n3. https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/D-\nmannitol#section=Top\n4.

Many have been\ndeveloped to provide zero-calorie or low calorie sweetening for\nfoods and drinks.\nBecause many of these provide little to no calories, these\nsweeteners are also referred to as non-nutritive sweeteners (FDA\nis using high-intensity sweeteners to describe these products3).\nAside from tagatose (described in sugar alcohol section), all of the\nsweeteners on the list below meet this criteria. Aspartame does\nprovide calories, but because it is far sweeter than sugar, the small\namount used does not contribute meaningful calories to a person\u2019s\ndiet. Until the FDA allowed the use of stevia, this collection of\nsweeteners were commonly referred to as artificial sweeteners\nbecause they were synthetically or artificially produced. However,\nwith stevia, the descriptor artificial can no longer be used to\ndescribe these sweeteners. More recently, Luo Han Guo Fruit\nextracts have also been allowed to be used as another high-intensity\nsweetener that is not synthesized or artificially produced. The table\nin the link below summarizes the characteristics of the FDA\napproved high-intensity sweeteners.\nWeb Link\nFDA High-Intensity Sweeteners\nSaccharin\nSaccharin is the oldest of the artificial sweeteners. You do not\nwant to use it in cooking or baking because it develops a bitter\ntaste4.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 61 Figure 2.131 Structure of saccharin5\nAspartame\nAspartame is made up of 2 amino acids (phenylalanine and\naspartate) and a methyl (CH3) group. The compound is broken down\nduring digestion into the individual amino acids. This is why it\nprovides 4 kcal/g, just like protein4. Because it can be broken down\nto phenylalanine, products that contain aspartame contain the\nfollowing message: \u201cPhenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine.\u201d\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) will be covered in greater detail in section\n2.25. When heated, aspartame breaks down and loses its sweet\nflavor1.\n62 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.132 Structure of aspartame6\nNeotame\nNeotame is like aspartame version 2.0. Neotame is structurally\nidentical to aspartame except that it contains an additional side\ngroup (bottom of figure below, which is flipped backwards to make\nit easier to compare their structures). While this looks like a minor\ndifference, it has profound effects on the properties of neotame.\nNeotame is much sweeter than aspartame and is heat-stable. It can\nstill be broken down to phenylalanine, but such small amounts are\nused that it is not a concern for those with PKU1,4.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 63 Figure 2.133 Structure of neotame7\nAdvantame\nThe newest, sweetest alternative sweetener approved by the FDA\nin 2014 is advantame. It is heat-stable and does not have a trade\nname yet3. Notice it also has a similar structure to aspartame and\nneotame. Like Neotame it can broken down to phenylalanine, but\nsuch small amounts are used that it is not a concern for those\nwith PKU. However, it has a much higher acceptable daily intake\nthan Neotame4, meaning there is less concern about adverse effects\nfrom consuming too much.\n64 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.134 Structure of advantame8\nAcesulfame-Potassium (K)\nAcesulfame-potassium (K) is not digested or absorbed, therefore\nit provides no energy or potassium to the body1. It is a heat-stable\nalternative sweetener.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 65 Figure 2.135 Structure of acesulfame-potassium (K)9\nSucralose\nSucralose is structurally identical to sucrose except that 3 of the\nalcohol groups (OH) are replaced by chlorine molecules (Cl). This\nsmall change causes sucralose to not be digested and as such is\nexcreted in feces1,4. It is a heat-stable alternative sweetener.\n66 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.136 Structure of sucralose10\nStevia\nStevia is derived from a South American shrub, with the leaves\nbeing the sweet part. The components responsible for this sweet\ntaste are a group of compounds known as steviol glycosides. The\nstructure of steviol is shown below.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 67 Figure 2.137 Structure of steviol12\nThe term glycoside means that there are sugar molecules bonded\nto steviol. The two predominant steviol glycosides are stevioside\nand rebaudioside A. The structure of these two steviol glycosides\nare very similar13. The structure of stevioside is shown below as an\nexample.\n68 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.138 Structure of stevioside14\nThe common name for a sweetener containing primarily\nrebaudioside A is rebiana13. Stevia sweeteners had been marketed\nas a natural alternative sweeteners, something that has been\nstopped by lawsuits as described in the following link.\nWeb Link\nWhat is natural and who decides?\nStevia is a heat-stable alternative sweetener.\nLuo Han Guo Fruit Extracts\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 69 Luo Han Guo (aka Siraitia grosvenrii Swingle, monk) fruit extracts\nare a newer, natural heat-stable alternative sweetener option\nderived from a native Chinese fruit. These extracts are sweet\nbecause of the mogrosides that they contain3. The structure of a\nmogroside is shown below.\nFigure 2.139 Structure of a mogroside15\nReferences & Links\n1.

There are 3 main classes of polysaccharides:\nstarch, glycogen, and most fibers. The following sections will\ndescribe the structural similarities and differences between the 3\nclasses of polysaccharides that are divided in the figure below.\nSubsections:\n2.151 Starch\n2.152 Glycogen\n2.153 Fiber\n2.151 Starch\nStarch is the storage form of glucose in plants. There are two forms\nof starch: amylose and amylopectin. Structurally they differ in that\namylose is a linear polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin is\nbranched. The linear portion of both amylose and amylopectin\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 75 contains alpha 1-4 glycosidic bonds, while the branches of\namylopectin are made up of alpha 1-6 glycosidic bonds.\nFigure 2.1511 Structure of amylose\nFigure 2.1512 Structure of amylopectin\nAmylopectin is more common than amylose (4:1 ratio on average) in\nstarch1,2. Some starchy foods include grains, root crops, tubers, and\nlegumes.\nReferences & Links\n1. Stipanuk MH. (2006) Biochemical, physiological, & molecular\naspects of human nutrition.

It is even more highly branched than\namylopectin, as shown below.\nFigure 2.1521 Structure of glycogen\nLike amylopectin, the branch points of glycogen are alpha 1-6\nglycosidic bonds, while the linear bonds are alpha 1-4 bonds, as\nshown below.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 77 Figure 2.1522 Structure of glycogen1\nThe advantage of glycogen\u2019s highly branched structure is that the\nmultiple ends (shown in red above) are where enzymes start to\ncleave off glucose molecules.

Whitney E, Rolfes SR. (2008) Understanding nutrition.\nBelmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.\n2.153 Fiber\nThe simplest definition of fiber is indigestible matter. Indigestible\nmeans that it survives digestion in the small intestine and reaches\nthe large intestine.\nThere are 3 major fiber classifications1:\nDietary Fiber \u2013 nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin that are\nintrinsic and intact in plants\nFunctional Fiber \u2013 isolated, nondigestible carbohydrates that have\nbeneficial physiological effects in humans\nTotal Fiber \u2013 dietary fiber + functional fiber\nThe differences between dietary and functional fiber are\ncompared in the table below:\nTable 2.1531 Differences between dietary fiber and functional\nfiber\nDietary Fiber Functional Fiber\nIntact in plants Isolated, extracted, or synthesized\nCarbohydrates + lignins Only carbohydrates\nOnly from plants From plants or animals\nNo proven benefit Must prove benefit\nDietary fiber is always intact in plants, whereas functional fiber\ncan be isolated, extracted or synthesized. Functional fiber is only\ncarbohydrates, while dietary fiber also includes lignins. Functional\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 79 fiber can be from plants or animals, while dietary fiber is only\nfrom plants. Functional fiber must be proven to have a physiological\nbenefit, while dietary fiber does not.\nPolysaccharide fiber differs from other polysaccharides in that\nit contains beta-glycosidic bonds (as opposed to alpha-glycosidic\nbonds). To illustrate these differences, consider the structural\ndifferences between amylose and cellulose (type of fiber). Both are\nlinear chains of glucose, the only difference is that amylose has\nalpha-glycosidic bonds, while cellulose has beta-glycosidic bonds as\nshown below.\nFigure 2.1531 Structures of amylose and cellulose\nThe beta-bonds in fiber cannot be broken down by the digestive\nenzymes in the small intestine so they continue into the large\nintestine.\nFiber can be classified by its physical properties. In the past,\nfibers were commonly referred to as soluble and insoluble. This\nclassification distinguished whether the fiber was soluble in water.\nHowever, this classification is being phased out in the nutrition\ncommunity. Instead, most fibers that would have been classified\nas insoluble fiber are now referred to as nonfermentable and/or\n80 | Human Nutrition nonviscous and soluble fiber as fermentable, and/or viscous\nbecause these better describe the fiber\u2019s characteristics2.\nFermentable refers to whether the bacteria in the colon can ferment\nor degrade the fiber into short chain fatty acids and gas. Viscous\nrefers to the capacity of certain fibers to form a thick gel-like\nconsistency. The following table lists some of the common types of\nfiber and provides a brief description about each.\nTable 2.1532 Common types of nonfermentable, nonviscous\n(insoluble) fiber\nFiber Description\nCellulose Main component of plant cell walls\nHemicellulose Surround cellulose in plant cell walls\nLignin Noncarbohydrate found within \u201cwoody\u201d plant cell walls\nTable 2.1533 Common types of fermentable, viscous (soluble) fiber\nFiber Description\nHemicellulose Surround cellulose in plant cell walls\nFound in cell walls and intracellular tissues of fruits and\nPectin\nberries\nBeta-glucans Found in cereal brans\nGums Viscous, usually isolated from seeds\nThe following table gives the percentage of total dietary fiber in 5\nfoods.\nTable 2.1534 Total dietary fiber (as percent of sample weight)3\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 81 Food Total Dietary Fiber\nCereal, all bran 30.1\nBlueberries, fresh 2.7\nBroccoli, fresh, cooked 3.5\nPork and beans, canned 4.4\nAlmonds, with skin 8.8\nThe table below shows the amount of nonfermentable, nonviscous\nfiber in these same five foods.\nTable 2.1535 Nonviscous fiber (as percent of sample weight)3\nFood Hemicellulose Cellulose Pectin Lignin Total\nCereal, all bran 15.3 7.5 0.9 4.3 28.0\nBlueberries, fresh 0.7 0.4 0.4 0.9 2.4\nBroccoli, fresh,\n0.9 1.2 0.7 0.3 3.1\ncooked\nPork and beans,\n0.9 1.6 0.3 0.2 3.0\ncanned\nAlmonds, with skin 1.8 3.3 1.6 1.9 8.6\nThe table below shows the amount of fermentable, viscous fiber in\nthese same five foods.\nTable 2.1536 Viscous Fiber (as percent of sample weight)3\nFood Hemicellulose Pectin Total\nCereal, all bran 2.0 0.1 2.1\nBlueberries, fresh 0.1 0.2 0.3\nBroccoli, fresh, cooked 0.2 0.2 0.4\nPork and beans, canned 1.1 0.3 1.4\nAlmonds, with skin 0.2 tr 0.2\ntr = trace amounts\nFoods that are good sources of non fermentable, non viscous\n82 | Human Nutrition fiber include whole wheat, whole grain cereals, broccoli, and other\nvegetables. This type of fiber is believed to decrease the risk of\nconstipation and colon cancer, because it increases stool bulk and\nreduces transit time4. This reduced transit time theoretically means\nshorter exposure to consumed carcinogens in the intestine, and\nthus lower cancer risk.\nFermentable, viscous fiber can be found in oats, rice, psyllium\nseeds, soy, and some fruits. This type of fiber is believed to decrease\nblood cholesterol and sugar levels, thus also lowering the risk of\nheart disease and diabetes, respectively4. Its viscous nature slows\nthe absorption of glucose preventing blood glucose from spiking\nafter consuming carbohydrates. It lowers blood cholesterol levels\nprimarily by binding bile acids, which are made from cholesterol,\nand causing them to be excreted. As such, more cholesterol is used\nto synthesize new bile acids.\nReferences & Links\n1. DRI Book \u2013 [Anonymous].

But instead of sugars, protein is\nmade up of amino acids. In the following sections, you will learn\nmore about how protein is synthesized and why it is important in\nthe body.\nSubsections:\n2.21 Amino Acids\n2.22 Protein Synthesis\n2.23 Protein Structure\n2.24 Protein Functions\n2.25 Types of Amino Acids\n2.26 Amino Acid Structures\n2.27 Protein Quality\n2.28 Protein-Energy Malnutrition\n2.21 Amino Acids\nSimilar to carbohydrates, proteins contain carbon (C), hydrogen (H),\nand oxygen (O). However, unlike carbohydrates (and lipids) proteins\nalso contain nitrogen (N). Proteins are made up of smaller units\ncalled amino acids. This name, amino acid, signifies that each\ncontains an amino (NH2) and carboxylic acid (COOH) groups. The\nonly structural difference in the 20 amino acids is the side group\nrepresented by the R below.\n84 | Human Nutrition Fig 2.211 Structure of an amino acid\nTo illustrate the differences in the side group we will consider\nglycine and alanine, the two simplest amino acids. For glycine the R\ngroup is hydrogen (H), while in alanine the R group is a methyl (CH3).\nThe structures of these two amino acids are shown below.\nFigure 2.212 Structure of glycine\nFigure 2.213 Structure of alanine\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 85 Individual amino acids are joined together using a peptide bond\n(green) and is shown in the figure below.\nFigure 2.214 Peptide bond formation1\nAmino acids can also come together to form tripeptides (three\namino acids), oligopeptides (3-10 amino acids), and polypeptides (10\nor more amino acids). A polypeptide is a chain of amino acids as\nshown below.\n86 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.216 A polypeptide chain2\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peptidformationball.svg\n2. http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=149\n2.22 Protein Synthesis\nThe process of protein synthesis is not as simple as stringing\ntogether amino acids to form a polypeptide. As shown below, this is\na fairly involved process. DNA contains the genetic code that is used\nas a template to create mRNA in a process known as transcription.\nThe mRNA then moves out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where\nit serves as the template for translation, where tRNAs bring in\nindividual amino acids that are bonded together to form a\npolypeptide.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 87 Figure 2.221 The process of creating a polypeptide1\nProteins, known as ribosomes, assist with translation. After\ntranslation, the polypeptide can be folded or gain structure as\nshown below and will be discussed in the next subsection (Protein\nStructure).\n88 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.222 Protein synthesis and processing\nThese videos do an excellent job of showing and explaining how\nprotein synthesis occurs.\nWeb Links\nVideo: Transcription (1:49)\nVideo: Translation (2:05)\nReferences & Links\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 89 1. http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Hyperion/DIR/VIP/\nGlossary/Illustration/mrna.cfm?key=messenger%20RNA\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Proteinsynthesis.png\nVideos\nTranscription \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MfSYnItYvg\nTranslation \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dsTvBaUMvw\n2.23 Protein Structure\nThere are four levels of protein structure. Primary structure is the\nlinear polypeptide chain. Secondary structure occurs when\nhydrogen bonding between amino acids in the same polypeptide\nchain causes the formation of structures such as beta-pleated\nsheets and alpha-helices. Tertiary structure occurs as a result of an\nattraction between different amino acids of the polypeptide chain\nand interactions between the different secondary structures.\nFinally, certain proteins contain quaternary structure where\nmultiple polypeptide chains are bonded together to form a larger\nmolecule. Hemoglobin is an example of a protein with quaternary\nstructure. The figure below illustrates the different levels of protein\nstructure.\n90 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.231 Different Protein Structures1\nThis video does a nice job of illustrating and explaining the different\nprotein structures.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Protein Structure (0:52)\nReferences & Links\n1. \u201c225 Peptide Bond-01\u201d by OpenStax College \u2013 Anatomy &\nPhysiology, Connexions Web site. http://cnx.org/content/\ncol11496/1.6/, Jun 19, 2013..

An enzyme catalyzes (enhances the\nrate) of a chemical reaction. The key part of an enzyme is its \u201cactive\nsite\u201d. The active site is where a compound to be acted on, known as\na substrate, enters. Enzymes are specific for their substrates; they\ndo not catalyze reactions on any random compounds floating by.\nYou might have heard the \u201clock and key\u201d analogy used for enzymes\nand substrates, respectively. After the substrate enters the active\nsite and binds, the enzyme slightly changes shape (conformation).\nThe enzyme then catalyzes a reaction that, in the example below,\nsplits the substrate into two parts. The products of this reaction are\nreleased and the enzyme returns to its native or original shape. It is\n92 | Human Nutrition then ready to catalyze another reaction. The figure and video below\nnicely illustrate the function of an enzyme.\nFigure 2.242 The function of enzymes2\nWeb Link\nVideo: Enzymes (0:49)\nEnzymes\u2019 names commonly end in -ase, and many are named for\ntheir substrate. For example the enzyme amylase cleaves bonds\nfound in amylose and amylopectin.\nHormones\nMany hormones are proteins. A hormone is a compound that is\nproduced in one tissue, released into circulation, then has an effect\non a different organ. Most hormones are produced from several\norgans, collectively known as endocrine organs. Insulin is an an\nexample of a hormone that is a protein.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Hormones (1:02)\nFluid Balance\nProteins help to maintain the balance between fluids in the\nplasma and the interstitial fluid. Interstitial fluid is the fluid that\nsurrounds cells. Interstitial fluid and plasma (fluid part of blood) are\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 93 the two components of extracellular fluid, or the fluid outside of\ncells. The following figure illustrates the exchange of fluid between\ninterstitial fluid and plasma.\nFigure 2.243 Interstitial Fluid and plasma3\nAcid-Base Balance\nProteins serve as buffers, meaning that they help to prevent the\npH of the body from getting too high or too low.\nTransport\nTransport proteins move molecules through circulation or across\ncell membranes. One example is hemoglobin that transports oxygen\nthrough the body. We will see a number of other examples as we\nmove through class.\nImmune Function\nAntibodies are proteins that recognize antigens (foreign\nsubstances that generate antibody or inflammatory response) and\n94 | Human Nutrition bind to and inactivate them. Antibodies are important in our ability\nto ward off disease.\nOther Functions\nProteins can also serve as neurotransmitters and can be used for\nenergy by forming glucose through gluconeogenesis.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Collagentriplehelix.png\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Induced_fit_diagram.svg\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Illu_capillary_microcirculation.jpg\nVideos\nEnzymes \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbZsXjgPDLQ\nHormones \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIPYVV4aThM\n2.25 Types of Amino Acids\nThere are 20 amino acids our body uses to synthesize proteins.\nThese amino acids can be classified as essential, non-essential, or\nconditionally essential. The table below shows how the 20 amino\nacids are classified.\nTable 2.251 Essential, conditionally essential, and nonessential\namino acids1\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 95 Essential Conditionally Essential Non-essential\nHistidine Arginine Alanine\nIsoleucine Cysteine Asparagine\nLeucine Glutamine Aspartic Acid or Aspartate\nLysine Glycine Glutamic Acid or Glutamate\nMethionine Proline Serine\nPhenylalanine Tyrosine\nThreonine\nTryptophan\nValine\nThe body cannot synthesize nine amino acids. Thus, it is essential\nthat these are consumed in the diet. As a result these amino acids\nare known as essential, or indispensable, amino acids. As an example\nof how amino acids were determined to be essential, Dr. William\nC.

Rose\nNon-essential, or dispensable, amino acids can be made in our body,\nso we do not need to consume them. Conditionally essential amino\nacids become essential for individuals in certain situations. An\nexample of a condition when an amino acid becomes essential is\nthe disease phenylketonuria (PKU). Individuals with PKU have a\nmutation in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which normally\nadds an alcohol group (OH) to the amino acid phenylalanine to form\ntyrosine as shown below.\n96 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.251 Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from a mutation in the enzyme\nphenylalanine hydroxylase2,3\nSince tyrosine cannot be synthesized by people with PKU, it\nbecomes essential for them. Thus, tyrosine is a conditionally\nessential amino acid. Individuals with PKU have to eat a very low\nprotein diet and avoid the alternative sweetener aspartame, because\nit can be broken down to phenylalanine. If individuals with PKU\nconsume too much phenylalanine, phenylalanine and its\nmetabolites, can build up and cause brain damage and severe\nmental retardation. The drug Kuvan was approved for use with PKU\npatients in 2007 who have low phenylalanine hydroxylase activity\nlevels.

You are not expected to memorize these structures. Often I\nsay the name of amino acids and not all students understand that\nI am talking about an amino acid. Each amino acid differs only by\nits side group, which is circled in red in each figure below.

Animal proteins such as meat, fish, milk, and eggs are\ngood examples of complete proteins. Incomplete proteins do not\ncontain adequate amounts of one or more of the essential amino\nacids. For example, if a protein doesn\u2019t provide enough of the\nessential amino acid leucine it would be considered incomplete.\nLeucine would be referred to as the limiting amino acid, because\nthere is not enough of it for the protein to be complete. Most plant\n102 | Human Nutrition foods are incomplete proteins, with a few exceptions such as soy.\nThe table below shows the limiting amino acids in some plant foods.\nTable 2.271 Limiting amino acids in some common plant foods1\nFood Limiting Amino Acid(s)\nBean and Most Legumes Methionine, Tryptophan\nTree Nuts and Seeds Methionine, Lysine\nGrains Lysine\nVegetables Methionine, Lysine\nComplementary Proteins\nEven though most plant foods do not contain complete proteins,\nit does not mean that they should be sworn off as protein sources.\nIt is possible to pair foods containing incomplete proteins with\ndifferent limiting amino acids to provide adequate amounts of the\nessential amino acids. These two proteins are called complementary\nproteins, because they supply the amino acid(s) missing in the other\nprotein. A simple analogy would be that of a 4 piece puzzle. If one\nperson has 2 pieces of a puzzle, and another person has 2 remaining\npieces, neither of them have a complete puzzle. But when they are\ncombined, the two individuals create a complete puzzle.\nFigure 2.271 Complementary proteins are kind of like puzzle\npieces\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 103 Two examples of complementary proteins are shown below.\nFigure 2.272 Two complementary protein examples2,3\nIt should be noted that complementary proteins do not need to\nbe consumed at the same time or meal. It is currently recommended\nthat essential amino acids be met on a daily basis, meaning that if\na grain is consumed at one meal, a legume could be consumed at a\nlater meal, and the proteins would still complement one another4.\nMeasures of Protein Quality\nHow do you know the quality of the protein in the foods you\nconsume? The protein quality of most foods has been determined\nby one of the methods below.\nBiological Value (BV) \u2013 (grams of nitrogen retained / grams of\nnitrogen absorbed) x 100\nProtein Efficiency Ratio (PER) \u2013 (grams of weight gained / grams\nof protein consumed)\nThis method is commonly performed in growing rats.\nChemical or Amino Acid Score (AAS) \u2013 (Test food limiting essential\namino acid (mg/g protein) / needs of same essential amino acid\n(mg/g protein))\nProtein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) \u2013\n(Amino Acid Score x Digestibility)\nThis is the most widely used method and was preferred by the\nFood and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization\n(WHO) until recently5,6.\n104 | Human Nutrition The following table shows the protein quality measures for some\ncommon foods.\nTable 2.272 Measures of protein quality5\nProtein PER Digestibility AAS (%) PDCAAS\nEgg 3.8 98 121 100*\nMilk 3.1 95 127 100*\nBeef 2.9 98 94 92\nSoy 2.1 95 96 91\nWheat 1.5 91 47 42\n*PDCAAS scores are truncated (cut off) at 100. These egg and milk\nscores are actually 118 and 121 respectively.\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recently\nrecommended that PDCAAS be replaced with a new measure of\nprotein quality, the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score\n(DIAAS). \u201cDIAAS is defined as: DIAAS % = 100 x [(mg of digestible\ndietary indispensable amino acid in 1 g of the dietary protein) / (mg\nof the same dietary indispensable amino acid in 1g of the reference\nprotein)].\u201d Ileal digestibility should be utilized to determine the\ndigestibility in DIAAS; ideally in humans, but if not possible in\ngrowing pigs or rats6.\nThe main differences between DIAAS and PDCAAS are that DIAAS:\n1. Takes into account individual amino acids digestibility rather\nthan protein digestibility.\n2. Focuses on ileal instead of fecal (total) digestibility.\n3. Has 3 different reference patterns (different age groups, 0-6\nmonths, 6 months- 3 years, 3-10 years old) instead of a single\npattern\n4. Are not truncated7\nHow do I find out the protein quality of what I\u2019m eating and\nidentify complementary proteins?\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 105 Nutrition Data is a useful resource for determining protein quality\nand identifying complementary proteins. To use the site, go to\nwww.nutritiondata.com, type in the name of the food you would\nlike to know about in the search bar and hit \u2018Enter\u2019. When you\nhave selected your food from the list of possibilities, you will be\ngiven information about this food. Included in this information is\nthe Protein Quality section. This will give you an amino acid score\nand a figure that illustrates which amino acid(s) is limiting. If your\nfood is an incomplete protein, you can click \u201cFind foods with a\ncomplementary profile\u201d. This will take you to a list of dietary choices\nthat will provide complementary proteins for your food.

Instead it is often coupled\nwith insufficient energy intake. As a result, the condition is called\nprotein-energy malnutrition (PEM). This condition is not common\nin the U.S., but is more prevalent in less developed countries.\nKwashiorkor and marasmus are the two forms of protein energy\nmalnutrition. They differ in the severity of energy deficiency as\nshown in the figure below.\nFigure 2.281 The 2 types of protein-energy malnutrition\nKwashiorkor is a Ghanaian word that means \u201cthe disease that the\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 107 first child gets when the new child comes1.\u201d The characteristic\nsymptom of kwashiorkor is a swollen abdomen.

We\ndo need to consume certain fats and we should try to incorporate\nsome fats into our diets for their health benefits. However,\nconsumption of certain fats is also associated with greater risk of\ndeveloping chronic disease(s). In this section we will dive deeper\ninto fats and why they do not need to be feared altogether.\nSubsections:\n2.31 How does fat differ from lipids?\n2.32 Fatty Acids\n2.33 Fatty Acid Naming & Food Sources\n2.34 Essential Fatty Acids\n2.35 Triglycerides\n2.36 Phospholipids\n2.37 Sterols\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 111 2.31 How Does Fat Differ From Lipids?\nThe answer you receive from this question will depend on who you\nask, so it is important to have an understanding of lipids and fats\nfrom a chemical and nutritional perspective.\nTo a chemist, lipids consist of:\nTriglycerides\nFatty Acids\nPhospholipids\nSterols\nThese compounds are grouped together because of their\nstructural and physical property similarities. For instance, all lipids\nhave hydrophobic (water-fearing) properties. Chemists further\nseparate lipids into fats and oils based on their physical properties\nat room temperature:\nFats are solid at room temperature\nOils are liquid at room temperature\nFrom a nutritional perspective, the definition of lipids is the same.\nThe definition of a fat differs, however, because nutrition-oriented\npeople define fats based on their caloric contribution rather than\nwhether they are solid at room temperature. Thus, from a nutrition\nperspective:\nFats are triglycerides, fatty acids, and phospholipids that provide\n9 kcal/g.\nThe other difference is that from a caloric perspective, an oil is a\nfat. For example, let\u2019s consider olive oil. Clearly, it is an oil according\nto a chemist definition, but from a caloric standpoint it is a fat\nbecause it provides 9 kcal/g.\nThe following sections will discuss the different lipid classes\nintroduced above in detail.\n112 | Human Nutrition 2.32 Fatty Acids\nFatty acids are lipids themselves, and they are also components of\ntriglycerides and phospholipids. Like carbohydrates, fatty acids are\nmade up of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O).\nOn one end of a fatty acid is a methyl group (CH3) that is known\nas the methyl or omega end. On the opposite end of a fatty acid is a\ncarboxylic acid (COOH). This end is known as the acid or alpha end.\nThe figure below shows the structure of fatty acids.\nFigure 2.321 Structure of a saturated fatty acid\nThere are a number of fatty acids in nature that we consume that\ndiffer from one another in three ways:\n1. Carbon chain length (i.e. 6 carbons, 18 carbons)\n2. Saturation/unsaturation\n3. Double bond configuration (cis, trans)\n1. Carbon Chain Length\nFatty acids differ in their carbon chain length (number of carbons\nin the fatty acid). Most fatty acids contain somewhere between 4-24\ncarbons, with even numbers (i.e. 8, 18) of carbons occurring more\nfrequently than odd numbers (i.e. 9, 19). Fatty acids are classified as\nshort-chain fatty acids, medium-chain fatty acids, and long-chain\nfatty acids based on their carbon chain length using the criteria\nshown in the table below.\nTable 2.321 Fatty acid classification\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 113 Classification # of carbons\nShort-Chain Fatty Acid < 6\nMedium-Chain Fatty Acid 6-12\nLong-Chain Fatty Acid \u226512\nCarbon chain length also impacts the physical properties of the fatty\nacid. As the number of carbons in a fatty acid chain increases, so\ndoes the melting point as illustrated in the figure below.\nFigure 2.322 The melting point of saturated fatty acids of varied lengths1\nThus, shorter chain fatty acids are more likely to be liquid, while\nlonger chain fatty acids are more likely to be solid at room\ntemperature (20-25?C, 68-77?F).\n2. Saturation/Unsaturation\nA saturated fatty acid is one that contains the maximum number\nof hydrogens possible, and no carbon-carbon double bonds. Carbon\nnormally has four bonds to it. Thus, a saturated fatty acid has\nhydrogens at every position except carbon-carbon single bonds and\ncarbon-oxygen bonds on the acid end. Two examples of the same\n18 carbon saturated fatty acid (stearic acid/stearate) are shown in\n114 | Human Nutrition Figures 2.321 and 2.323. Figure 2.323 is the simplified view of the this\nfatty acid.\nFigure 2.323 A simplified view of 18 carbon saturated fatty acid stearic acid2.\nEach corner of the zigzag pattern represents a carbon, and the hydrogens are\nnot shown to allow quicker recognition of the carbon chain\nUnsaturation means the fatty acid doesn\u2019t contain the maximum\nnumber of hydrogens on each of its carbons. Instead, unsaturated\nfatty acids contain a carbon-carbon double bond and only 1\nhydrogen off each carbon. The simplest example of unsaturation is\na monounsaturated fatty acid. Mono means one, so these are fatty\nacids with one degree of unsaturation, or one double bond (shown\nbelow).\nFigure 2.324 Structure of the monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid)\nFigure 2.325 The simplified structure of the monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic\nacid)4\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 115 Any fatty acid that has two or more double bonds is considered\na polyunsaturated fatty acid. As you may remember from the\npolysaccharide section, poly means many. A simple example of a\npolyunsaturated fatty acid is linoleic acid (shown below).\nFigure 2.326 Structure of the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid, a\npolyunsaturated fatty acid with two carbon-carbon double bonds5\n3. Double Bond Configuration (Shape)\nDouble bonds in unsaturated fatty acids are in one of two\nstructural orientations: cis or trans. In a trans orientation, the\nhydrogens on the carbons involved in the double bond are opposite\nof one another. In the cis orientation the hydrogens are on the same\nside of the bond. Steric hindrance in the cis orientation causes the\nchain to take on a more bent shape.\nFigure 2.327 Cis and trans structural conformations of a monounsaturated\nfatty acid\n116 | Human Nutrition Most natural unsaturated fatty acids are in the cis conformation.\nAs can be seen in Figure 2.327, the cis fatty acids have a more of\nkinked shape, which means they do not pack together as well as the\nsaturated or trans fatty acids. As a result, the melting point is much\nlower for cis fatty acids compared to trans and saturated fatty acids.\nTo illustrate this difference, the figure below shows the difference\nin the melting points of saturated, trans-, and cis-monounsaturated\n18 carbon fatty acids.\nFigure 2.328 The melting point of saturated, trans, and cis 18 carbon\nmonounsaturated fatty acids1\nThere are some naturally occurring trans fatty acids, such as\nconjugated linoleic acid (CLA), in dairy products. However, for the\nmost part, trans fatty acids in our diets are not natural; instead,\nthey have been produced synthetically. The primary source of trans\nfatty acids in our food supply is partially hydrogenated vegetable\noil. The \u2018hydrogenated\u2019 means that the oil has gone through the\nprocess of hydrogenation. Hydrogenation, like the name implies, is\nthe addition of hydrogen. If an unsaturated fatty acid is completely\nhydrogenated it would be converted to a saturated fatty acid as\nshown below.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 117 Figure 2.329 Fatty acid hydrogenation\nHowever, this isn\u2019t/wasn\u2019t always desirable, thus partially\nhydrogenated vegetable oil became widely used. To visualize the\ndifference in the amount of hydrogenation consider the difference\nbetween tub margarine and stick margarine.\nStick margarine is more fully hydrogenated leading it to have a\nmuch harder texture. This is one of the two reasons to hydrogenate,\nto get a more solid texture. The second reason is that it makes it\nmore shelf-stable, because the double bond(s) of unsaturated fatty\nacids are susceptible to oxidation, which causes them to become\nrancid.\nPartial hydrogenation causes the conversion of cis to trans fatty\nacids along with the formation of some saturated fatty acids.\nOriginally, it was thought that trans fatty acids would be a better\nalternative to saturated fat (think margarine vs. butter). However,\nit turns out that trans fat is actually worse than saturated fat in\naltering biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease. Trans\nfat increases LDL and decreases HDL levels, while saturated fat\nincreased LDL without altering HDL levels. But this does not mean\nthat butter is a better choice than margarine as described in the\n118 | Human Nutrition first link. The FDA revoked Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)\nstatus of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil as described in the\nsecond link, and is requiring its use to be phased out by 2018. After\nthat point, permission will need to be requested to use them in\nfoods.\nWeb Links\nButter vs. Margarine: Which is better for my heart?\nFDA to Limit Trans Fats in Foods\nReferences & Links\n1.

Delta nomenclature\n2. Omega nomenclature\n3. Common names\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 119 The omega nomenclature and common names are used more in\nthe field of nutrition than the delta nomenclature when describing\nspecific fatty acids.\n2. Delta Nomenclature\nFor delta nomenclature you need to know 3 things:\n1. Number of carbons in the fatty acid\n2. Number of double bonds\n3. Number of carbons from the carboxylic acid (alpha) end to the\nfirst carbon in the double bond(s)\nLet\u2019s consider the example in the figure below.\nFigure 2.331 Delta Nomenclature\n1. Number of carbons in the fatty acid = 18\n2. Number of double bonds = 1\n3. Number of carbons from the carboxylic acid end to the first\ncarbon in the double bond = 9\nThis is then written as shown in Figure 2.331.\n2. Omega Nomenclature\n120 | Human Nutrition The omega nomenclature is almost exactly the same as the delta\nnomenclature, the only differences being:\n1. Carbons are counted from the methyl (omega) end instead of\nthe carboxylic acid end\n2. The omega symbol is used instead of the delta symbol\nFor omega nomenclature you need to know 3 things:\n1. Number of carbons in the fatty acid\n2. Number of double bonds\n3. Number of carbons from the methyl end (aka Omega end) to\nthe first carbon in the double bond closest to the methyl end\nWe will again consider the same fatty acid.\nFigure 2.332 Omega Nomenclature\n1. Number of carbons in the fatty acid = 18\n2. Number of double bonds = 1\n3. Number of carbons from the methyl (aka omega) end to the\nfirst carbon in the double bond closest to the methyl end = 9\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 121 If it is a saturated fatty acid, then the omega nomenclature is not\nadded to the end of the name. If it is an 18 carbon saturated fatty\nacid, then it would be named 18:0.\nThis is written as shown in figure 2.332. Instead of an omega\nprefix, the prefix n- (i.e. n-3) is also commonly used.\n3. Common Names\nThe common names of fatty acids are something that, for the\nmost part, have to be learned/memorized. The common name of\nthe fatty acid we have been naming in this section is oleic acid.\nFigure 2.333 Oleic acid\nHowever, it can also be called oleate. The only difference is that,\ninstead of a carboxylic acid on the end of the fatty acid, it has been\nionized to form a salt (shown below). This is what the -ate ending\nindicates and the two names are used interchangeably.\n122 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.334 Oleate\nThe table below gives the common names and food sources of some\ncommon fatty acids.\nTable 2.331 Common names of fatty acids2\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 123 Omega Name Common Name\n4:0 Butyric Acid\n12:0 Lauric Acid\n14:0 Myristic Acid\n16:0 Palmitic acid\n18:0 Stearic Acid\n20:0 Arachidic Acid\n24:0 Lignoceric Acid\n18:1 (n-9) Oleic Acid\n18:2 (n-6) Linoleic Acid\n18:3 (n-3) Alpha-linolenic Acid\n20:4 (n-6) Arachidonic Acid\n20:5 (n-3) Eicosapentanoic Acid\n22:6 (n-3) Docosahexanoic Acid\nThe NutritionData link below can help you identify foods that are\nhigh in a specific fatty acid.\nWeb Link\nNutritionData: Fatty Acids\nFood Sources of Fatty Acids\nAfter going through this wide array of fatty acids, you may be\nwondering where they are found in nature. The figure below shows\nthe fatty acid composition of certain oils and oil-based foods. As you\ncan see, most foods contain a mixture of fatty acids. Stick margarine\nis the only product in the figure that contains an appreciable\namount of trans fatty acids. Corn, walnut, and soybean are rich\nsources of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, while flax seed is fairly\nunique among plants in that it is a good source of n-3\npolyunsaturated fatty acids. Canola and olive oil are rich sources of\nmonounsaturated fatty acids. Lard, palm oil, butter and coconut oil\nall contain a significant amount of saturated fatty acids.\n124 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.335 Fatty acid composition of foods and oils3\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Myristoleic_acid.png\n2.

The structures of\nthe two essential fatty acids are shown below.\nFigure 2.341 Linoleic acid1\nFigure 2.342 Alpha-linolenic acid2\nHowever, we do possess enzymes that can take the essential fatty\nacids, elongate them (add two carbons to them), and then further\ndesaturate them (add double bonds) to other omega-6 and omega-3\nfatty acids. Thus, there are 2 families of fatty acids that the majority\nof polyunsaturated fatty acids fit into as shown below.\n126 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.343 Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and eicosanoid production3\nThe same enzymes are used for both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty\nacids. However, we cannot convert omega-3 fatty acids to omega-6\nfatty acids or omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids. Among\nthese families, the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),\nand the omega-6 fatty acids, dihomo gamma-linolenic acid and\narachidonic acid (AA), are used to form compounds known as\neicosanoids. These 20 carbon fatty acid derivatives are biologically\nactive in the body (like hormones, but they act locally in the tissue\nthey are produced). There are four classes of eicosanoids:\nProstaglandins (PG)\nProstacyclins (PC)\nThromboxanes (TX)\nLeukotrienes (LT)\nSome examples of eicosanoid structures are shown in the figure\nbelow:\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 127 Figure 2.344 Eicosanoid structures4-8The difference in the effects\nand outcomes of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid intake is primarily\na result of the eicosanoids produced from them. Omega-6 fatty acid\nderived eicosanoids are more inflammatory than omega-3 fatty acid\nderived eicosanoids. As a result, omega-3 fatty acids are considered\nanti-inflammatory because replacing the more inflammatory\nomega-6 fatty acid derived eicosanoids with omega-3 fatty acid\nderived eicosanoids will decrease inflammation. As an example of\nthe action of eicosanoids, aspirin works by inhibiting the enzymes\ncyclooxygenase (Cox)-1 and Cox-2. These enzymes convert\narachidonic acid into inflammatory prostaglandins as shown below.\n128 | Human Nutrition Figure 2.345 Aspirin inhibits Cox-1 and Cox-29\nYou have probably heard that you should get more omega-3s in\nyour diet, and in general polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered\nhealthy. However, since omega-3 fatty acids are competing for the\nsame enzymes as omega-6 fatty acids, and because the omega-6\nfatty acids are more inflammatory, consuming too many omega-6s\nis probably more detrimental than helpful. As a result, many people\ntalk about the omega-3:omega-6 fatty acid ratio in people\u2019s\u2019 diets.\nFor most Americans, the ratio is believed to be too high, at almost\n10-20 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids10.\nThe table below shows good food sources of some selected omega-3\nand omega-6 fatty acids.Table 2.341 Good food sources of selected\nomega-3 and omega-6 fatty acidsEven though Figure 2.343\nillustrates the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to EPA and DHA,\nthis conversion is actually quite limited; 0.2-8% of ALA is converted\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 129 to EPA and 0-4% of ALA is converted to DHA11. Thus, dietary\nconsumption is the most effective way to get the longer chain fatty\nacids (EPA and DHA) in our bodies. It is less clear whether ALA\nconsumption is as beneficial as EPA and DHA, but a recent study\nfound it to be equally effective in decreasing blood triglyceride\nconcentrations. In that study, DHA had the added positive benefit of\nincreasing HDL12. These are all positive outcomes that are expected\nto reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However,\nthere is evidence accumulating that there is not much\ncardiovascular benefit from taking fish oil supplements as described\nin the article below.Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency Essential fatty\nacid deficiency is rare and unlikely to occur, but the symptoms\nare:Growth retardationReproductive problemsSkin\nlesionsNeurological and visual problemsReferences & Links\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LAnumbering.png\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ALAnumbering.png\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EFA_to_Eicosanoids.svg\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prostaglandin_E1.svg\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thromboxane_A2.png\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leukotriene_B4.svg\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prostaglandin_I2.png\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leukotriene_E4.svg\n\u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eicosanoid_synthesis.svg\n\u2022 Simopoulos AP.

Breaking down the name triglyceride tells\na lot about their structure. \u201cTri\u201d refers to the three fatty acids,\n\u201cglyceride\u201d refers to the glycerol backbone that the three fatty acids\nare bonded to. Thus, a monoglyceride contains one fatty acid, a\ndiglyceride contains two fatty acids. Triglycerides perform the\nfollowing functions in our bodies:Provide energyPrimary form of\nenergy storage in the bodyInsulate and protectAid in the absorption\nand transport of fat-soluble vitamins.A triglyceride is formed by\nthree fatty acids being bonded to glycerol as shown below.\nFigure 2.351 Triglyceride formation\nWhen a fatty acid is added to the glycerol backbone, this process\nis called esterification. This process is so named, because it forms\nan ester bond between each fatty acid and the glycerol. Three\nmolecules of water are also formed during this process as shown\nbelow.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 131 Figure 2.352 Esterification of three fatty acids to glycerol\nA stereospecific numbering (sn) system is used to number the three\nfatty acids in a triglyceride sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3 respectively. A\ntriglyceride can also be simply represented as a polar (hydrophilic)\nhead, with 3 nonpolar (hydrophobic) tails, as shown below.\nFigure 2.353 Stereospecific numbering (sn) of triglycerides\n132 | Human Nutrition The three fatty acids in a triglyceride can be the same or can each be\na different fatty acid. A triglyceride containing different fatty acids\nis known as a mixed triglyceride. An example of a mixed triglyceride\nis shown below.\nFigure 2.354 Structure of a mixed triglyceride\nNo References2.36 PhospholipidsPhospholipids are similar in\nstructure to triglycerides, with the only difference being a\nphosphate group and nitrogen-containing compound in the place of\na fatty acid.\nEnergy-Yielding Macronutrients | 133 Figure 2.361 Structure of a phospholipid, R represents the\ndifferent fatty acids, X represents the nitrogen-containing\ncompound off of the phosphate group1\nThe best known phospholipid is phosphatidylcholine (aka lecithin).\nAs you can see in the structure below, it contains a choline off of the\nphosphate group.\nFigure 2.362 Structure of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin)\nHowever, you will not normally find phospholipids arranged like a\n134 | Human Nutrition triglyceride, with the 3 tails opposite of the glycerol head.

The gastrointestinal (GI, digestive) tract, the passage\nthrough which our food travels, is a \u201ctube within a tube.\u201d The trunk\nof our body is the outer tube and the GI tract is the interior tube, as\nshown below. Thus, even though the GI tract is within the body, the\nactual interior of the tract is technically outside of the body. This is\nbecause the contents have to be absorbed into the body. If it\u2019s not\nabsorbed, it will be excreted and never enter the body itself.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 145 Figure 3.11 The digestive tract, also known as the gastrointestinal\ntract, is a \u201ctube within a tube\u201d\nA number of organs are involved in digestion, which collectively are\nreferred to as the digestive system.\n146 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.12 The digestive system1\nThe organs that form the gastrointestinal tract (mouth, esophagus,\nstomach, small intestine, large intestine (aka colon), rectum, and\nanus) come into direct contact with the food or digestive content.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 147 Figure 3.13 The gastrointestinal or digestive tract2\nThe journey through the gastrointestinal tract starts in the mouth\nand ends in the anus as shown below:\nMouth \u2013> Esophagus \u2013> Stomach \u2013> Small Intestine \u2013> Large\nIntestine \u2013> Rectum \u2013> Anus\nIn addition to the GI tract, there are digestion accessory organs\n(salivary glands, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver) that play an\nintegral role in digestion.

The salivary glands release\nsaliva, mucus, and the enzymes, salivary amylase and lysozyme.\n150 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.21 The mouth1\nSalivary amylase cleaves the alpha 1-4 glycosidic bonds in the starch\nmolecules, amylose and amylopectin. However, salivary amylase\ncannot cleave the branch points in amylopectin where there are\nalpha 1-6 glycosidic bonds, as shown in the figure below. Overall this\nenzyme accounts for a minor amount of carbohydrate digestion.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 151 Figure 3.22 Enzymatic action of salivary amylase. Purple arrows point to\nalpha 1-4 glycosidic bonds that can be cleaved. The yellow arrows point to the\nalpha 1-6 glycosidic bonds that cannot be cleaved\nLysozyme helps break down bacteria cell walls to prevent a possible\ninfection. Another enzyme, lingual lipase, is also released in the\nmouth. Although it is released in the mouth, it is most active in\nthe stomach where it preferentially cleaves short-chain fatty acids\nin the sn-3 position. Lingual lipase has a small role in digestion\nin adults, but may be important for infants to help break down\ntriglycerides in breast milk2.\nSwallowing\nNow that the food has been thoroughly chewed and formed into a\nbolus, it can proceed down the throat to the next stop in digestion.\nIt will move down the pharynx where it reaches a \u201cfork in the road\u201d,\nwith the larynx as one road and the esophagus as the other. The\nesophagus road leads to the stomach; this is the direction that food\nshould go. The other road, through the larynx, leads to the trachea\nand ultimately the lungs. This is definitely not where you want your\nfood or drink going, as this is the pathway for the air you breathe.\n152 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.23 Cross section of face. The epiglottis covers larynx to prevent food\nand drink from entering the lungs3\nFortunately, our body was designed in such a way that a small tissue,\ncalled the epiglottis, covers the opening to the trachea. It directs the\nfood down the correct road as shown below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 153 Figure 3.24 Epiglottis is like a traffic cop guiding food down the correct\ndigestion road.\nEsophagus\nBefore being correctly guided into the esophagus, the bolus of\nfood will travel through the upper esophageal sphincter. Sphincters\nare circular muscles that are found throughout the gastrointestinal\ntract that essentially serve as gates between the different sections.\nOnce in the esophagus, wavelike muscular movements, known as\nperistalsis, occur, as shown in the animation and video in the links\nbelow.\nWeb Links\nPeristalsis Animation\nVideo: Peristalsis (0:57)\nAt the end of the esophagus the bolus will encounter the lower\nesophageal sphincter. This sphincter keeps the harmful acids of\nthe stomach out of the esophagus. However, in many people this\nsphincter is leaky, which allows stomach acid to reflux, or creep up,\nthe esophagus. Stomach acid is very acidic (has a low pH). The ruler\nbelow will give you an idea of just how acidic the stomach is.

Our stomach is involved in both chemical and mechanical\ndigestion. Mechanical digestion occurs as the stomach churns and\n156 | Human Nutrition grinds food into a semisolid substance called chyme (partially\ndigested food).\nThe lining of the stomach is made up of different layers of tissue.\nThe mucosa is the outermost layer (closest to stomach cavity) as\nshown in the figure below.\nFigure 3.31 The anatomy of the stomach1\nThe mucosa is not a flat surface. Instead, its surface is lined by\ngastric pits, as shown in the figure below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 157 Figure 3.32 Gastric pits2\nGastric pits are indentations in the stomach\u2019s surface that are lined\nby four different types of cells.\n158 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.33 Blowup of mucosa to show the structure of gastric pits1\nThe following video is a nice introduction to gastric pits and talks\nabout chief and parietal cells that are covered in more detail below.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Gastric Pits (0:56)\nAt the bottom of the gastric pit are the G cells that secrete the\nhormone gastrin. Gastrin stimulates the parietal and chief cells that\nare found above the G cells. The chief cells secrete the zymogen\npepsinogen and the enzyme gastric lipase. A zymogen is an inactive\nprecursor of an enzyme that must be cleaved or altered to form the\nactive enzyme. The parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl),\nwhich lowers the pH of the gastric juice (water + enzymes + acid).\nThe HCl inactivates salivary amylase and catalyzes the conversion of\npepsinogen to pepsin. Finally, the top of the pits are the neck cells\nthat secrete mucus to prevent the gastric juice from digesting or\ndamaging the stomach mucosa3. The table below summarizes the\nactions of the different cells in the gastric pits.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 159 Table 3.41 Cells involved in the digestive processes in the stomach\nType of Cell Secrete\nNeck Mucus\nChief Pepsinogen and gastric lipase\nParietal HCl\nG Gastrin\nThe figure below shows the action of all these different secretions\nin the stomach.\nFigure 3.34 The action of gastric secretions in the stomach\nTo reiterate, the figure above illustrates that the neck cells of the\ngastric pits secrete mucus to protect the mucosa of the stomach\nfrom essentially digesting itself. Gastrin from the G cells stimulates\nthe parietal and chief cells to secrete HCl and enzymes, respectively.\nThe HCl in the stomach denatures salivary amylase and other\nproteins by breaking down the structure and, thus, the function\nof it. HCl also converts pepsinogen to the active enzyme pepsin.\nPepsin is a protease, meaning that it cleaves bonds in proteins. It\nbreaks down the proteins in food into individual peptides (shorter\n160 | Human Nutrition segments of amino acids). The other enzyme that is active in the\nstomach is gastric lipase. This enzyme preferentially cleaves the\nsn-3 position of triglycerides to produce 1,2-diglyceride and a free\nfatty acid, as shown below4. It is responsible for up to 20% of\ntriglyceride digestion3.\nFigure 3.35 Gastric Lipase action results in production of 1,2-diglyceride and\na free fatty acid\nThe chyme will then leave the stomach and enter the small intestine\nvia the pyloric sphincter (shown below).\nFigure 3.36 Cross section of the stomach showing the pyloric sphincter5\nMacronutrient Digestion | 161 Table 3.32 Summary of chemical digestion in the stomach\nChemical or Enzyme Action\nStimulates chief cells to release pepsinogen\nGastrin\nStimulates parietal cells to release HCl\nDenatures salivary amylase\nHCl\nDenatures proteins\nActivates pepsinogen to pepsin\nPepsin Cleaves proteins to peptides\nGastric lipase Cleaves sn-3 FA of triglycerides\nReferences & Links\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach#/media/\nFile:Illu_stomach2.jpg\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gray1055.png\n3.

It is divided into\nthree sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (shown below).\nAfter leaving the stomach, the first part of the small intestine that\nchyme will encounter is the duodenum.\n162 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.41 Three sections of the small intestine1\nThe small intestine consists of many layers, which can be seen in the\ncross section below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 163 Figure 3.42 Cross section of the small intestine2\nExamining these layers closer, we are going to focus on the\nepithelium, which comes into contact with the chyme and is\nresponsible for absorption. The lumen is the name of the cavity that\nis considered \u201coutside the body\u201d that chyme moves through.\n164 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.43 Cross section of small intestine with the structures labeled2\nThe organization of the small intestine is in such a way that it\ncontains circular folds and finger-like projections known as villi. The\nfolds and villi are shown in the next few figures.\nFigure 3.44 Folds in the small intestine2\nMacronutrient Digestion | 165 Figure 3.45 Villi in the small intestine3\nFigure 3.46 Villi line the surface of the small intestine2,4\nIf we were to zoom in even closer, we would be able to see that\nenterocytes (small intestine absorptive cells) line villi as shown\nbelow.\n166 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.47 Enterocytes line villi4\nThe side, or membrane, of the enterocyte that faces the lumen is not\nsmooth either. It is lined with microvilli, and is known as the brush\nborder (aka apical) membrane, as shown below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 167 Figure 3.48 Enterocyte, or small intestinal absorptive cell is lined with\nmicrovilli. This lined surface is referred to as the brush border membrane.\nTogether these features (folds + villi + microvilli) increase the\nsurface area ~600 times versus if it was a smooth tube5. More\nsurface area leads to more contact with the enterocytes and thus,\nincreased absorption.\nGoing even closer, we discover that the surface of the microvilli\nis covered by the hair-like glycocalyx, which is glycoproteins and\ncarbohydrates as shown below.\n168 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.49 Glycocalyx lines the microvilli\nNow that you have learned about the anatomy of the small intestine,\nthe following subsections go through the different digestive\nprocesses that occur there.\nSubsections:\n3.41 Digestive Hormones, Accessory Organs, & Secretions\n3.42 Carbohydrate Digestion in the Small Intestine\n3.43 Protein Digestion in the Small Intestine\n3.44 Lipid Digestion in the Small Intestine\nReferences & Links\n1. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nImage:Illu_small_intestine_catal%C3%A0.png\n2.

Digestion accessory organs assist in digestion,\nbut are not part of the gastrointestinal tract. How are these organs\ninvolved?\nUpon entering the duodenum, the chyme causes the release of\ntwo hormones from the small intestine: secretin and\ncholecystokinin (CCK, previously known as pancreozymin) in\nresponse to acid and fat, respectively. These hormones have\nmultiple effects on different tissues. In the pancreas, secretin\nstimulates the secretion of bicarbonate (HCO3), while CCK\nstimulates the secretion of digestive enzymes. The bicarbonate and\ndigestive enzymes released together are collectively known as\npancreatic juice, which travels to the small intestine, as shown\nbelow.\n170 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.411 The hormones secretin and CCK stimulate the pancreas to secrete\npancreatic juice1\nIn addition, CCK also stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder\ncausing the secretion of bile into the duodenum.\nPancreas\nThe pancreas is found behind the stomach and has two different\nportions. It has an endocrine (hormone-producing) portion that\ncontains alpha and beta cells that secrete the hormones glucagon\nand insulin, respectively. However, the vast majority of the pancreas\nis made up of acini, or acinar cells, that are responsible for\nproducing pancreatic juice. The following video does a nice job of\nshowing and explaining the function of the different pancreatic\ncells.\nWeb Link\nVideo: The Pancreas (First 53 seconds)\nBicarbonate is a base (high pH) meaning that it can help neutralize\nMacronutrient Digestion | 171 acid. You can find sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, baking soda) on\nthe ruler below to get an idea of its pH.\nFigure 3.412 pH of some common items2\nThe main digestive enzymes in pancreatic juice are listed in the\ntable below. Their function will be discussed further in later\nsubsections.\nTable 3.411 Enzymes in pancreatic juice\n172 | Human Nutrition Enzyme\nPancreatic alpha-amylase\nProteases\nPancreatic Lipase & Procolipase*\nPhospholipase A2\nCholesterol Esterase\n*Not an enzyme\nLiver\nThe liver is the largest internal and most metabolically active\norgan in the body. The figure below shows the liver and the\naccessory organs position relative to the stomach.\nFigure 3.413 Location of digestion accessory organs relative to the stomach3\nThe liver is made up two major types of cells. The primary liver\ncells are hepatocytes, which carry out most of the liver\u2019s functions.\nHepatic is another term for liver. For example, if you are going to\nrefer to liver concentrations of a certain nutrient, these are often\nreported as hepatic concentrations. The other major cell type is the\nhepatic stellate (also known as Ito) cells. These are fat storing cells\nin the liver. These two cell types are depicted below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 173 Figure 3.414 Hepatocytes (PC) and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) along with an\nelectron microscope image showing the lipid droplets within a stellate cell4\nThe liver\u2019s major role in digestion is to produce bile. This is a\ngreenish-yellow fluid that is composed primarily of bile acids, but\nalso contains cholesterol, phospholipids, and the pigments bilirubin\nand biliverdin. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol. The two\nprimary bile acids are chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid. In the\nsame way that fatty acids are found in the form of salts, these bile\nacids can also be found as salts. These salts have an (-ate) ending, as\nshown below.\n174 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.415 Structures of the 2 primary bile acids\nBile acids, much like phospholipids, have a hydrophobic and\nhydrophilic end. This makes them excellent emulsifiers that are\ninstrumental in fat digestion. Bile is then transported to the\ngallbladder.\nGallbladder\nThe gallbladder is a small, sac-like organ found just off the liver\n(see figures above). Its primary function is to store and concentrate\nbile made by the liver. The bile is then transported to the duodenum\nthrough the common bile duct.\nWhy do we need bile?\nBile is important because fat is hydrophobic and the environment\nin the lumen of the small intestine is watery. In addition, there is an\nunstirred water layer that fat must cross to reach the enterocytes in\norder to be absorbed.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 175 Figure 3.416 Fat is not happy alone in the watery environment of the small\nintestine.\nHere triglycerides form large triglyceride droplets to keep the\ninteraction with the watery environment to a minimum. This is\ninefficient for digestion, because enzymes cannot access the\ninterior of the droplet. Bile acts as an emulsifier, or detergent. It,\nalong with phospholipids, forms smaller triglyceride droplets that\nincrease the surface area that is accessible for triglyceride digestion\nenzymes, as shown below.\n176 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.417 Bile acids and phospholipids facilitate the production of smaller\ntriglyceride droplets.\nSecretin and CCK also control the production and secretion of bile.\nSecretin stimulates the flow of bile from the liver to the gallbladder.\nCCK stimulates the gallbladder to contract, causing bile to be\nsecreted into the duodenum, as shown below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 177 Figure 3.418 Secretion stimulates bile flow from liver; CCK stimulates the\ngallbladder to contract3\nReferences & Links\n1.

Pancreatic alpha-amylase, like salivary amylase, cleaves the\nalpha 1-4 glycosidic bonds of carbohydrates, reducing them to\nsimpler carbohydrates, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and\ndextrins (oligosaccharides containing 1 or more alpha 1-6 glycosidic\nbonds). Pancreatic amylase is also unable to cleave the branch point\nalpha 1-6 bonds1.\nFigure 3.421 The function of pancreatic amylase\nMacronutrient Digestion | 179 Figure 3.422 Products of pancreatic amylase\nThe pancreatic amylase products, along with the disaccharides\nsucrose and lactose, then move to the surface of the enterocyte.\nHere, there are disaccharidase enzymes (lactase, sucrase, maltase)\non the outside of the enterocyte. Enzymes, like these, that are on\nthe outside of cell walls are referred to as ectoenzymes. Individual\nmonosaccharides are formed when lactase cleaves lactose, sucrase\ncleaves sucrose, and maltase cleaves maltose. There is also another\nbrush border enzyme, alpha-dextrinase. This enzyme cleaves alpha\n1-6 glycosidic bonds in dextrins, primarily the branch point bonds\nin amylopectin. The products from these brush border enzymes are\nthe single monosaccharides glucose, fructose, and galactose that\nare ready for absorption into the enterocyte1.\nFigure 3.423 Disaccharidases on the outside of the enterocyte.\n180 | Human Nutrition References & Links\n1.

Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing.\n3.43 Protein Digestion in the Small Intestine\nThe small intestine is the major site of protein digestion by\nproteases (enzymes that cleave proteins). The pancreas secretes a\nnumber of proteases as zymogens into the duodenum where they\nmust be activated before they can cleave peptide bonds1. This\nactivation occurs through an activation cascade. A cascade is a\nseries of reactions in which one step activates the next in a\nsequence that results in an amplification of the response. An\nexample of a cascade is shown below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 181 Figure 3.431 An example of a cascade, with one event leading to many more\nevents\nIn this example, A activates B, B activates C, D, and E, C activates F\nand G, D activates H and I, and E activates K and L. Cascades also\nhelp to serve as control points for certain process. In the protease\ncascade, the activation of B is really important because it starts the\ncascade.\nThe protease/colipase activation scheme starts with the enzyme\nenteropeptidase (secreted from the intestinal brush border) that\nconverts trypsinogen to trypsin. Trypsin can activate all the\nproteases (including itself) and colipase (involved in fat digestion)1\nas shown in the 2 figures below.\n182 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.432 Protease/colipase activation cascade\nMacronutrient Digestion | 183 Figure 3.433 The protease/colipase activation cascade\nThe products of the action of the proteases on proteins are\ndipeptides, tripeptides, and individual amino acids, as shown below.\nFigure 3.434 Products of pancreatic proteases\nAt the brush border, much like disaccharidases, there are peptidases\nthat cleave some peptides down to amino acids. Not all peptides\nare cleaved to individual amino acid, because small peptides can\nbe taken up into the enterocyte, thus, the peptides do not need\n184 | Human Nutrition to be completely broken down to individual amino acids. Thus the\nend products of protein digestion are primarily dipeptides and\ntripeptides, along with individual amino acids1.\nFigure 3.435 Peptidases are produced by the brush border to cleave some\npeptides into amino acids\nReferences & Links\n1.

There are\nspecific enzymes for the digestion of triglycerides, phospholipids,\nand cleavage of esters from cholesterol. We will look at each in this\nsection.\nTriglycerides\nThe pancreas secretes pancreatic lipase into the duodenum as\npart of pancreatic juice. This major triglyceride digestion enzyme\npreferentially cleaves the sn-1 and sn-3 fatty acids from\ntriglycerides. This cleavage results in the formation of a\n2-monoglyceride and two free fatty acids as shown below.\nFigure 3.441 Pancreatic lipase cleaves the sn-1 and sn-3 fatty acids of\ntriglycerides\n186 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.442 The products of pancreatic lipase are a 2-monoglyceride and two\nfree fatty acids\nTo assist lipase, colipase serves as an anchor point to help lipase\nattach to the triglyceride droplet.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 187 Figure 3.443 Colipase helps anchor lipase to the triglyceride droplet\nPhospholipids\nThe enzyme phospholipase A2 cleaves the C-2 fatty acid of\nlecithin, producing lysolecithin and a free fatty acid.\nFigure 3.444 Phospholipase A2 cleaves the C-2 fatty acid of lecithin\n188 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.445 Products of phospholipase A2 cleavage\nCholesterol Esters\nThe fatty acid in cholesterol esters is cleaved by the enzyme,\ncholesterol esterase, producing cholesterol and a free fatty acid.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 189 Figure 3.446 Cholesterol esterase cleaves fatty acids off of cholesterol\nFigure 3.447 Products of cholesterol esterase\n190 | Human Nutrition Formation of Mixed Micelles\nIf nothing else happened at this point, the 2-monoglycerides and\nfatty acids produced by pancreatic lipase would form micelles. The\nhydrophilic heads would be outward and the fatty acids would be\nburied on the interior. These micelles are not sufficiently water-\nsoluble to cross the unstirred water layer to get to the brush border\nof enterocytes. Thus, mixed micelles are formed containing\ncholesterol, bile acids, and lysolecithin in addition to the\n2-monoglycerides and fatty acids, as illustrated below1.\nFigure 3.448 Normal (left) and mixed (right) micelles\nMixed micelles are more water-soluble, allowing them to cross the\nunstirred water layer to the brush border of enterocytes for\nabsorption.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 191 Figure 3.449 Mixed micelles can cross the unstirred water layer for absorption\ninto the enterocytes\nReferences & Links\n1.

We could follow the uptake\nof the digested compounds into the enterocyte or we could finish\nfollowing what has escaped digestion and is going to continue into\nthe large intestine. Obviously from the title of this section we are\ngoing to do the latter. As we learned previously, fiber is a crude term\nfor what has survived digestion and has reached the large intestine.\nFigure 3.61 The fork in the road between finishing digestion in the colon and\nabsorption into the enterocyte\nThe ileocecal valve is the sphincter between the ileum and the large\nintestine. This name should make more sense as we go through the\nanatomy of the large intestine.\n196 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.62 The ileocecal valve1\nThe large intestine consists of the colon, the rectum, and the anus.\nThe colon can be further divided into the cecum (hence the -cecal\nin ileocecal valve, ileo- refers to ileum), ascending colon, transverse\ncolon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon as shown below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 197 Figure 3.63 Anatomy of the large intestine and rectum2\nThe large intestine is responsible for absorbing remaining water\nand electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride). It also forms\nand excretes feces. The large intestine contains large amounts of\nmicroorganisms like those shown in the figure below.\n198 | Human Nutrition Figure 3.64 Magnified image of bacteria3\nThe large intestine can also be referred to as the gut. There are\na large number of microorganisms found throughout the\ngastrointestinal tract that collectively are referred to as the flora,\nmicroflora, biota, or microbiota. Technically, microbiota is the\npreferred term because flora means \u201cpertaining to plants\u201d. There\nare 10 times more microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract than\ncells in the whole human body4. As can be seen in the figure below,\nthe density of microorganisms increases as you move down the\ndigestive tract.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 199 Figure 3.65 Relative amount of bacteria in selected locations of the GI tract.\ncfu/ml = colony forming unit, a measure of the number of live\nmicroorganisms in 1 mL of digestive sample5,6\nAs described in the fiber sections, there are two different fates for\nfiber once it reaches the large intestine. The fermentable, viscous\nfiber is fermented by bacteria. Fermentation is the metabolism of\ncompounds by the microorganisms in the gut. An example of\nfermentation is the utilization of the oligosaccharides raffinose and\nstachyose by microorganisms that results in the production of gas,\nwhich can lead to flatulence. Also, some bile acids are fermented\nby microorganisms to form secondary bile acids that can be\nreabsorbed. These secondary bile acids represent approximately\n20% of the total bile acids in our body. Fermentable fibers can be\nused to form short-chain fatty acids that can then be absorbed\nand used by the body. The nonfermentable, nonviscous fiber is not\nreally altered and will be a component of feces, that is then excreted\nthrough the rectum and anus. This process involves both an internal\nand external sphincter that are shown in figure 3.63 above.\nSubsection:\n3.61 Probiotics & Prebiotics\n200 | Human Nutrition References & Links\n1. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gray1075.png\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Illu_intestine.jpg\n3. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nImage:Cholera_bacteria_SEM.jpg\n4.

This is because there\nare beneficial and non-beneficial bacteria inhabiting our\ngastrointestinal tracts. Thus, theoretically, if you can increase the\nbeneficial or decrease the non- beneficial bacteria, there may be\nimproved health outcomes. In response to this, probiotics and\nprebiotics have been identified/developed. A probiotic is a live\nmicroorganism that is consumed, and colonizes in the body as\nshown in the figures below.\nMacronutrient Digestion | 201 Figure 3.611 Probiotics the consumption of the bacteria itself\nA prebiotic is a nondigestible food component that selectively\nstimulates the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria. An example\nof a prebiotic is inulin, which is shown in the figure below.\nFigure 3.612 Inulin, an indigestible food component that is a commonly used\nprebiotic\n202 | Human Nutrition The net result is the same for both prebiotics and probiotics, an\nincrease in the beneficial/non beneficial microorganism ratio.\nFigure 3.613 An effective prebiotic or probiotic should result in an increase in\nthe beneficial bacteria\nThe following video does a nice job of explaining and illustrating\nhow probiotics work. The NCCAM website is a good source of\ninformation if you have further questions on the topic.\nWeb Links\nVideo: Probiotics (3:40)\nNCCAM: Probiotics\nSome common examples of probiotics are DanActive\u00ae and\nActivia\u00ae.\nWeb Links\nDanActive\u00ae (inactive link as of 05/18/2021)\nActivia\u00ae\nThe claims that companies made about their produce probiotic\nMacronutrient Digestion | 203 products have come under scrutiny.

Not\neverything that is taken up into the enterocyte from the lumen\nwill be absorbed, so the term uptake refers to compounds being\ntransported into the enterocyte. Absorption means that a\ncompound is transported from the enterocyte into circulation.\nUnder most circumstances, compounds that are taken up will then\nbe absorbed. After this chapter, hopefully this distinction between\nthese terms will be clear. After later micronutrient chapters,\nhopefully you will understand the reason for emphasizing this\ndistinction.\nSections:\n4.1 Crypts of Lieberkuhn & Enterocyte Maturation\n4.2 Absorptive Lineup & Cell Membranes\n4.3 Types of Cell Uptake/Transport\n4.4 Carbohydrate Uptake, Absorption, Transport & Liver Uptake\n4.5 Protein Uptake, Absorption, Transport & Liver Uptake\n4.6 Lipid Uptake, Absorption & Transport\n4.7 Glycemic Response, Insulin & Glucagon\n4.1 Crypts of Lieberkuhn & Enterocyte\nMaturation\nThere are some additional anatomical and physiological features of\nthe small intestine that are important to understand before before\ndefining uptake and absorption. Crypts of Lieberkuhn are pits\nbetween villi as pointed out by the green arrow in the figure below.\n206 | Macronutrient Uptake,\nAbsorption & Transport Figure 4.11 A crypt of Lieberkuhn is the pit between the villi in the small\nintestine as pointed out by the green arrow1\nThe crypts of Lieberkuhn (often referred to simply as crypts) are\nsimilar to the gastric pits in the stomach. The crypts contain stem\ncells that can produce a number of different cell types, including\nenterocytes2. From these stem cells in the crypt, immature\nenterocyte cells are formed that mature as they rise, or migrate up,\nthe villi. Thus, the tips at the top of villi are where the mature, fully\nfunctioning enterocytes are located, as represented by the purple\ncells in the figure below3.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 207 Figure 4.12 Crypts are represented by green arrows, fully mature enterocytes\nare represented by the purple cells at the top of the villi\nThis maturation and migration is a continuous process. The life\ncycle of an enterocyte is 72 hours once it enters the villus from the\ncrypt2. At the top, enterocytes are sloughed off, and, unless they are\ndigested (contain proteins and lipid) and components are taken up\nby enterocytes still on villi, they will be excreted in feces as depicted\nin the figure below.\n208 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.13 Enterocytes sloughed off the villus. Unless these cells are digested\nand their components are taken up by other enterocytes on the villus, they\nwill be excreted in feces\nThus, we define absorption as reaching body circulation, because\ncompounds taken up into enterocytes might not make it into body\ncirculation, and thus are not necessarily absorbed.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/\n2.

Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing.\n4.2 Uptake Lineup & Cell Membranes\nHaving completed digestion in the small intestine, a number of\ncompounds are ready for uptake into the enterocyte. The figure\nbelow shows the macronutrient uptake lineup, or what is ready to\nbe taken up into the enterocyte.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 209 Figure 4.21 The macronutrient uptake lineup\nFrom lipids, we have the lysolecithin (from phospholipid),\n2-monoglyceride (from triglycerides), fatty acids, and cholesterol.\nFrom protein, there are small peptides (di- and tripeptides) and\namino acids. From carbohydrates, only the monosaccharides\nglucose, galactose, and fructose will be taken up. The other\nmacronutrient, water, has not been discussed so far because it does\nnot undergo digestion.\nHowever, these compounds must now cross the plasma (cell)\nmembrane, which is a phospholipid bilayer. In the cell membrane,\nthe hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids point into the lumen as\nwell as towards the interior of the cell, while the tails are on the\ninterior of the plasma membrane as shown below.\n210 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.22 Plasma membrane of a cell\nThe plasma membrane contains proteins, cholesterol, and\ncarbohydrates in addition to the phospholipids. Membrane proteins,\nsuch as channels and pumps, are important for the transport of\nsome compounds across the cell membrane. The figure and two\nvideos below do a nice job of illustrating the components of the cell\nmembrane.\nFigure 4.23 Cell membrane1\nWeb Links\nVideo: Cell Membrane (1:27)\nVideo: Voyage inside the cell: Membrane (1:23)\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Cell_membrane_detailed_diagram_4.svg\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 211 Videos\nCell Membrane \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=owEgqrq51zY\nVoyage Inside the Cell: Membrane \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=GW0lqf4Fqpg\n4.3 Types of Cell Uptake/Transport\nThere are a number of different forms of uptake/transport utilized\nby your body. These can be classified as passive or active. The\ndifference between the two is whether energy is required and\nwhether (from a solute perspective) they move with or against a\nconcentration gradient. Passive transport does not require energy\nto move with a concentration gradient. Active transport requires\nenergy to move against the concentration gradient.\nThe energy for active uptake/transport is provided by adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency in the body. The\nstructures of adenosine and phosphate are shown below.\n212 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.31 Structures of adenosine (left) and phosphate (right)\nTri- means three, thus ATP is adenosine with three phosphate\ngroups bonded to it, as shown below.\nFigure 4.32 Structure of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 213 Phosphorylation is the formation of a phosphate bond.\nDephosphorylation is removal of a phosphate bond. Overall\nphosphorylation is a process that require energy. The net effect of\ndephosphorylation is the release of energy. Thus, energy is required\nto add phosphates to ATP, energy is released through removing\nphosphates from ATP.\nThe concentration gradient is a way to describe the difference\nbetween the concentration of the solute outside of a cell versus\nthe concentration inside of a cell. A solute is what is dissolved in a\nsolvent in a solution; the more solute the higher the concentration.\nMoving with the gradient is typically moving of solute from a region\nof higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. The\nexception is osmosis, which moves solvent instead of solute to have\nthe same effect of equalizing concentrations on both sides of the\nmembrane. Moving against the gradient is moving solute from an\narea of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.\nSubsections:\n4.31 Passive Uptake/Transport\n4.32 Active Uptake/Transport\n4.31 Passive Uptake/Transport\nThere are three forms of passive uptake/transport:\n1. Simple Diffusion\n2. Osmosis\n3. Facilitated Diffusion\nBelow is more information of each type of uptake/transport.\n1. Simple Diffusion\nSimple diffusion is the movement of solutes from an area of higher\n214 | Human Nutrition concentration (with the concentration gradient) to an area of lower\nconcentration without the help of a protein, as shown below.\nFigure 4.311 Simple diffusion\n2. Osmosis\nOsmosis is similar to simple diffusion, but water moves instead of\nsolutes. In osmosis water molecules move from an area of lower\nconcentration to an area of higher concentration of solute as shown\nbelow. The effect of this movement is to dilute the area of higher\nconcentration.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 215 Figure 4.312 Osmosis\nThe following videos do a nice job of illustrating osmosis.\nWeb Links\nVideo: Osmosis (0:47)\nVideo: Osmosis in the Kitchen (0:58)\nAnother example illustrating osmosis is the red blood cells in\ndifferent solutions shown below.\n216 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.313 Effect of salt solution concentration on red blood cells1\nWe will consider the simple example of salt as the solute. If the\nsolution is hypertonic, that means that there is a greater\nconcentration of salt outside (extracellular) the red blood cells than\nwithin them (intracellular). Water will then move out of the red\nblood cells to the area of higher salt concentration, resulting in\nthe shriveled red blood cells depicted. Isotonic means that there is\nno difference between concentrations. There is an equal exchange\nof water between intracellular and extracellular fluids. Thus, the\ncells are normal, functioning red blood cells. A hypotonic solution\ncontains a lower extracellular concentration of salt than the red\nblood cell intracellular fluid. As a result, water enters the red blood\ncells, possibly causing them to burst.\n3. Facilitated Diffusion\nThe last form of passive absorption is similar to diffusion in that it\nfollows the concentration gradient (higher concentration to lower\nconcentration). However, it requires a carrier protein to transport\nthe solute across the membrane.

Active Carrier Transport\n2. Endocytosis\n218 | Human Nutrition 1. Active Carrier Transport\nActive carrier transport is similar to facilitated diffusion in that it\nutilizes a protein (carrier). However, energy is also used to move\ncompounds against their concentration gradient.

Endocytosis\nEndocytosis is the engulfing of particles, or fluids, to be taken up\ninto the cell. If a particle is endocytosed, this process is referred to\nas phagocytosis. If a fluid is endocytosed, this process is referred to\nas pinocytosis as shown below.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 219 Figure 4.322 Different types of endocytosis2\nThe following video does a really nice job of showing how\nendocytosis occurs.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Endocytosis (0:35)\nReferences & Links\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scheme_sodium-\npotassium_pump-en.svg\n2. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Endocytosis_types.svg\nVideos\nActive Transport \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=STzOiRqzzL4\nEndocytosis \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gLtk8Yc1Zc\n220 | Human Nutrition 4.4 Carbohydrate Uptake, Absorption,\nTransport & Liver Uptake\nMonosaccharides are taken up into the enterocyte. Glucose and\ngalactose are taken up by the sodium-glucose cotransporter 1\n(SGLT1, active carrier transport). The cotransporter part of the\nname of this transporter means that it also transports sodium along\nwith glucose or galactose. Fructose is taken up by facilitated\ndiffusion through glucose transporter (GLUT) 5. There are 12\nglucose transporters that are named GLUT 1-12, and all use\nfacilitated diffusion to transport monosaccharides. The different\nGLUTs have different functions and are expressed at high levels\nin different tissues. Thus, the intestine might be high in GLUT5,\nbut not in GLUT12. Moving back to monosaccharides, inside the\nenterocyte, all three are then transported out of the enterocyte into\nthe capillary (absorbed) through GLUT2 as shown below1.\nFigure 4.41 Carbohydrate uptake and absorption\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 221 Inside of each villus there are capillaries and lacteals as shown\nbelow. Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels in the body, lacteals\nare also small vessels but are part of the lymphatic system, as will be\ndescribed further in a later subsection.\nFigure 4.42 Anatomy of a villus2\nThe following video does a nice job of illustrating capillaries and\nlacteal and provides some basic detail on uptake and absorption.\n222 | Human Nutrition Web Link\nVideo: Absorption in the Small Intestine\nThe capillaries in the small intestine join to the portal vein, which\ntransports monosaccharides directly to the liver. The figure below\nshows the portal vein and all the smaller vessels from the stomach,\nsmall intestine, and large intestine that feed into it.\nFigure 4.43 The portal vein transports monosaccharides and amino acids to\nthe liver3\nAt the liver, galactose and fructose are completely taken up through\nGLUT5, while only 30-40% of glucose is taken up through GLUT2.\nAfter the monosaccharides are taken up, they are phosphorylated\nby their respective kinase enzymes forming galactose-1-phosphate,\nfructose-1-phosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate as shown below.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 223 Figure 4.44 Hepatic monosaccharide uptake\nKinase enzymes normally phosphorylate substrates.\nPhosphorylation of the monosaccharides is important for\nmaintaining the gradient (by keeping unphosphorylated\nmonosaccharide levels within hepatocytes low) needed for\nfacilitated diffusion through the GLUT transporters3.\nReferences & Links\n1.

How the body handles the rise in blood glucose\nafter a meal is referred to as the glycemic response. The pancreas\nsenses the blood glucose levels and responds appropriately. After\na meal, the pancreatic beta-cells sense that glucose levels are high\nand secrete the hormone insulin, as shown below1.\nFigure 4.51 Pancreatic beta-cells sense high blood glucose and secrete insulin\nThus, as can be seen in the following figure, blood insulin levels peak\nand drop with blood glucose levels over the course of a day.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 225 Figure 4.52 Representative figure of blood glucose and insulin levels during a\n24-hour period2\nBlood glucose and insulin levels rise following carbohydrate\nconsumption, and they drop after tissues have taken up the glucose\nfrom the blood (described below). Higher than normal blood sugar\nlevels are referred to as hyperglycemia, while lower than normal\nblood sugar levels are known as hypoglycemia.\nInsulin travels through the bloodstream to the muscle and\nadipose cells. There, insulin binds to the insulin receptor. This\ncauses GLUT4 transporters that are in vesicles inside the cell to\nmove to the cell surface as shown below.\n226 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.53 Response of muscle and adipose cells to insulin; 1) binding of\ninsulin to its receptor, 2) movement of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell surface.\nThe movement of the GLUT4 to the cell surface allows glucose to\nenter the muscle and adipose cells. The glucose is phosphorylated\nto glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase (different enzyme but same\nfunction as glucokinase in liver) to maintain gradient.\nFigure 4.54 Response of muscle and adipose cells to insulin part 2; hexokinase\nphosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 227 Glucagon is a hormone that has the opposite action of insulin.\nGlucagon is secreted from the alpha-cells of the pancreas when\nthey sense that blood glucose levels are low, as shown below.\nFigure 4.55 Glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells in response to low\nblood glucose levels.\nGlucagon binds to the glucagon receptor in the liver, which causes\nthe breakdown of glycogen to glucose as illustrated below..\n228 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.56 Glucagon binding to its receptor leads to the breakdown of\nglycogen to glucose.\nThis glucose is then released into circulation to raise blood glucose\nlevels as shown below.\nFigure 4.57 Glucagon leads to the release of glucose from the liver.\nSubsections:\n4.51 Diabetes\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 229 4.52 Glycemic Index\n4.53 Glycemic Load\nReferences & Links\n1.

The\nprevalence of diabetes in the US has been rapidly increasing; the link\nbelow provides some statistics about prevalence.\nWeb Link\nDiabetes Statistics\nThere are 2 forms of diabetes, type 1 and type 2.\nIn type 1 diabetes, not enough insulin is produced, as shown in the\nfigure below.\n230 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.512 Type 1 diabetes\nAs a result, GLUT4 does not make it to the surface of muscle and\nadipose cells, meaning glucose is not taken up into these cells.\nType 1 diabetes was previously known as juvenile-onset, or\ninsulin-dependent diabetes and is estimated to account for 5-10% of\ndiabetes cases1. Type 1 diabetics receive insulin through injections\nor pumps to manage their blood sugar.\nIn type 2 diabetes, the body produces enough insulin, but the\nperson\u2019s body is resistant to it. In type 2 diabetics the binding of\ninsulin to its receptor does not cause GLUT4 to move to the surface\nof the muscle and adipose cells, thus no glucose is taken up.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 231 Figure 4.513 Type 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95% of diabetes cases and was\nonce known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes or adult-onset\ndiabetes1. However, with the increasing rates of obesity, many\nyounger people are being diagnosed with type 2, making the latter\ndefinition no longer appropriate. Some people with type 2 diabetes\ncan control their condition with a diet and exercise regimen. This\nregimen improves their insulin sensitivity, or their response to the\nbody\u2019s own insulin. Others with type 2 diabetes must receive insulin.\nThese individuals are producing enough insulin, but are so resistant\nto it that more is needed for glucose to be taken up by their muscle\nand adipose cells.\nThe video below illustrates type 2 diabetes. However, I do not\nagree, nor do I teach, that type 2 diabetics have decreased insulin\nlevels as described in the video.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Diabetes Mellitus (1:36)\n232 | Human Nutrition References & Links\n1. http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/statistics/#what\nLink\nDiabetes Statisitics \u2013 http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/\nstatistics/\nVideo\nDiabetes Mellitus \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=VLiTbb6MaEU\n4.52 Glycemic Index\nResearch has indicated that hyperglycemia is associated with\nchronic diseases and obesity. As a result, measures of the glycemic\nresponse to food consumption have been developed so that people\ncan choose foods with a smaller glycemic response. The first\nmeasure developed for this purpose was the glycemic index. The\nglycemic index is the relative change in blood glucose after\nconsumption of 50 g of carbohydrate in a test food compared to\n50 g of carbohydrates of a reference food (white bread or glucose).\nThus, a high glycemic index food will produce a greater rise in blood\nglucose concentrations compared to a low glycemic index food, as\nshown below.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 233 Figure 4.521 Blood glucose response to a high glycemic index (GI) food\ncompared to a low glycemic index food1\nAs a general guideline, a glycemic index that is 70 or greater is high,\n56-69 is medium, and 55 and below is low. A stop light graphical\npresentation has been designed to emphasize the consumption of\nthe low glycemic index foods while cautioning against the\nconsumption of too many high glycemic index foods2.\n234 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.522 Food glycemic index classifications2\nThe main problem with the glycemic index is that it does not take\ninto account serving sizes. Let\u2019s take popcorn (glycemic index\n89-127) as an example. A serving size of popcorn is 20 g, 11 g of\nwhich is carbohydrate3. This is equal to approximately 2.5 cups of\npopcorn4. Thus, a person would have to consume over 11 cups of\npopcorn to consume 50 g of carbohydrate needed for the glycemic\nindex measurement. Another example is watermelon, which has a\nglycemic index of 103, with a 120 g serving containing only 6 g of\ncarbohydrates3. To consume the 50 g needed for glycemic index\nmeasurement, a person would need to consume over 1000 g (1 kg)\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 235 of watermelon. Assuming this is all watermelon flesh (no rind), this\nwould be over 6.5 cups of watermelon4.\nThe website glycemicindex.com (link provided below) contains a\ndatabase where you can search to see the food\u2019s glycemic index and\nglycemic load (covered in the next section). The database contains\ndetail on how the measurement was done and more information on\nthe product itself. The top link below will take you to this website.\nThe second link is to another database that contains the same\ninformation that might be easier for some people to use. However,\nplease note that in the second link the glycemic loads are calculated\nusing 100 g serving sizes for all foods. This might not be the actual\nserving size for all foods, which is what is typically used, so it is\nimportant to keep this in mind.\nWeb Links\nglycemicindex.com\nGlycemic Index & Glycemic Load of Foods\nReferences & Links\n1. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/\nGlycemic.png\n2. www.glycemicindex.com\n3.

It is calculated as\nshown below:\nGlycemic Load = (Glycemic Index X (g) Carbs/serving)/100\nThus, for most people, the glycemic load is a more meaningful\nmeasure of the glycemic impact of different foods.

Individual amino\nacids are taken up through a variety of amino acid transporters.\nOnce inside the enterocyte, peptidases cleave the peptides to\nindividual amino acids. These cleaved amino acids, along with those\nthat were taken up as individual amino acids, are moved into the\ncapillary by another variety of amino acid transporters (some are\nthe same as on the brush border, some are different).\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 239 Figure 4.61 Protein uptake and absorption\nThe capillary inside a villus is shown below.\n240 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.62 Anatomy of a villus1\nLike monosaccharides, amino acids are transported directly to the\nliver through the portal vein.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 241 Figure 4.63 The portal vein transports monosaccharides and amino acids to\nthe liver2\nAmino acids are taken up into the hepatocyte through a variety of\namino acid transporters.

One mechanism is that\nindividual components of micelles may diffuse across the\nenterocyte. Otherwise, it is believed that some components may be\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 243 taken up through unresolved transporters. For example, cholesterol\ntransporters have been identified, but their overall mechanism of\nabsorption is not well understood. The individual compounds are\ntaken up as shown below.\nFigure 4.71 Uptake of mixed micelle components into the enterocyte\nOnce inside the enterocyte, there are different fates for fatty acids,\ndepending on their length. Short- and medium-chain fatty acids\nmove through the enterocyte and enter circulation through the\ncapillaries; they are transported by the protein albumin. They will\nbe carried to the liver by the portal vein, like monosaccharides and\namino acids. Long-chain fatty acids, 2-monoglyceride, lysolecithin,\nand cholesterol will be re-esterified forming triglycerides,\nphosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol esters, respectively. These re-\nesterified lipids are then packaged into chylomicrons, which are\nlipoproteins, that are described in further detail in the next section.\nThese chylomicrons are too large to fit through the pores in the\ncapillaries, but they can fit through the larger fenestrations\n(openings) in the lacteal.\n244 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.72 Fates of lipids in the enterocyte\nLacteals (shown below) are small vessels that feed into the lymphatic\nsystem. Thus, the chylomicrons enter the lacteals and enter into\nlymphatic circulation.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 245 Figure 4.73 Anatomy of a villus, with the lacteal shown in blue1\nThe lymphatic system is a system similar to the circulatory system\nin that it contains vessels that transport fluid. However, instead\nof blood, the lymphatic system contains a clear fluid known as\nlymph. There are a number of lymph nodes (small glands) within the\nlymphatic system that play a key role in the body\u2019s immune system.\nThe figure below shows the lymphatic system.\n246 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.74 The lymphatic system2\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 247 The following videos describe and illustrate how the lymphatic\nsystem and lymph functions.\nWeb Links\nVideo: Lymphatic System (0:49)\nVideo: Lymph Movement (0:44)\nThe lymphatic system enters general circulation through the\nthoracic duct that enters the left subclavian vein as shown below.\nGeneral in this case means that it is not directed to the liver like\nother components that have been absorbed.\nFigure 4.75 The thoracic duct is where the lymphatic system enters\ncirculation.\n248 | Human Nutrition The animation below is an overview of lipid digestion, uptake, and\ninitial transport.\nWeb Links\nAnimation: Lipid Digestion, Uptake, and Transport\nSubsection:\n4.71 Lipoproteins\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Intestinal_villus_simplified.svg\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illu_lymphatic_system.jpg\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gray505.png\nLink\nhttp://www.wiley.com/college/grosvenor/0470197587/\nanimations/Animation_Lipid_Digestion_and_Absorption/\nEnergy/media/content/dig/anima/dig5a/frameset.htm\nVideos\nLymphatic system \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=qTXTDqvPnRk\nLymph Movement \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=ZdYxx4CHb-A\n4.71 Lipoproteins\nLipoproteins, as the name suggests, are complexes of lipids and\nprotein. The proteins within a lipoprotein are called apolipoproteins\n(aka apoproteins). There are a number of different apolipoproteins\nthat are abbreviated apo-, then an identifying letter (i.e. Apo A) as\nshown in the chylomicron below.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 249 Figure 4.711 Chylomicron structure1\nThe following video does a nice job of illustrating the different\nlipoprotein components.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Lipoproteins (0:28)\nThere are a number of lipoproteins in the body. They differ by\nthe apolipoproteins they contain, size (diameter), density, and\ncomposition. The table below shows the difference in density and\ndiameter of different lipoproteins. Notice that as diameter\ndecreases, density increases.\nTable 4.711 The density and diameter of different lipoproteins2\n250 | Human Nutrition Lipoprotein Density (g/dL) Diameter (nm)\nChylomicrons 0.95 75-1200\nVLDL (very low-density lipoproteins) 0.95-1.006 30-80\nIDL (intermediate-density lipoproteins) 1.006-1.019 25-35\nLDL (low-density lipoproteins) 1.019-1.063 18-25\nHDL (high-density lipoproteins) 1.063-1.21 5-12\nThis inverse relationship is a result of the larger lipoproteins being\ncomposed of a higher percentage of triglyceride and a lower\npercentage of protein as shown below.\nFigure 4.712 Composition of lipoproteins3\nProtein is more dense than triglyceride (why muscle weighs more\nthan fat), thus the higher protein/lower triglyceride composition,\nthe higher the density of the lipoprotein. Many of the lipoproteins\nare named based on their densities (i.e. very low-density\nlipoproteins).\nAs described in the last subsection, the lipoproteins released from\nthe small intestine are chylomicrons. The video below does a nice\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 251 job of showing, describing, and illustrating how chylomicrons are\nconstructed and function.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Chylomicrons (0:55)\nThe endothelial cells that line blood vessels, especially in the muscle\nand adipose tissue, contain the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL\ncleaves the fatty acids from lipoprotein triglycerides so that the\nfatty acids can be taken up into tissues. The figure below illustrates\nhow endothelial cells are in contact with the blood that flows\nthrough the lumen of blood vessels.\nFigure 4.713 Lining of a blood vessel. The lumen is where the blood would be\nflowing, thus endothelial cells are those that are in contact with blood4\nLPL cleaves fatty acids from the triglycerides in the chylomicron,\ndecreasing the amount of triglyceride in the lipoprotein. This\n252 | Human Nutrition lipoprotein with less triglycerides becomes what is known as a\nchylomicron remnant, as shown below.\nFigure 4.714 The cleavage of triglycerides by LPL from a chylomicron leads to\nthe formation of a chylomicron remnant.\nNow in the form of a chylomicron remnant, the digested lipid\ncomponents originally packaged into the chylomicron are directed\nto the liver where the chylomicron remnant is endocytosed. This\nprocess of clearing chylomicrons from the blood takes 2-10 hours\nafter a meal2. This is why people must fast 12 hours before having\ntheir blood lipids (triglycerides, HDL, LDL etc.) measured. This fast\nallows all the chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants to be cleared\nbefore blood is taken. However, whether patients should be asked ot\nfast has been questioned as described in the link below.\nWeb Link\nShould you fast before a cholesterol test?\nAfter the chylomicron remnant is endocytosed, it is broken down\nto its individual components (triglycerides, cholesterol, protein\netc.). In the liver, VLDL are produced, similar to how chylomicrons\nare produced in the small intestine. The individual components are\npackaged into VLDL and secreted into circulation as shown below.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 253 Figure 4.715 Chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver. The liver\nsecretes VLDL that contain cholesterol (C)\nLike it does to chylomicrons, LPL cleaves fatty acids from\ntriglycerides in VLDL, forming the smaller IDL (aka VLDL remnant).\nFurther action of LPL on IDL results in the formation of LDL. The\nC in Figures 4.715 and 4.716 represents cholesterol, which is not\nincreasing; rather, since triglyceride is being removed, it constitutes\na greater percentage of particle mass of lipoproteins. As a result,\nLDL is composed mostly of cholesterol, as depicted in the figure\nbelow.\n254 | Human Nutrition Figure 4.716 Formation of IDL and LDL from VLDL\nLDL contains a specific apolipoprotein (Apo B100) that binds to\nLDL receptors on the surface of target tissues. The LDL are then\nendocytosed into the target tissue and broken down to cholesterol\nand amino acids.\nHDL are made up of mostly protein and are derived from the liver\nand intestine. HDL participates in reverse cholesterol transport,\nwhich is the transport of cholesterol back to the liver. HDL picks\nup cholesterol from tissues/blood vessels and returns it to the liver\nitself or transfers it to other lipoproteins returning to the liver.\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 255 Figure 4.717 HDL is involved in reverse cholesterol transport\nThe animation under the transport button in the following link\ndoes a really nice job of going through the process of lipoprotein\ntransport.\nWeb Link\nLipoprotein Animation\nYou are probably familiar with HDL and LDL being referred to as\n\u201cgood cholesterol\u201d and \u201cbad cholesterol,\u201d respectively. This is an\noversimplification to help the public interpret their blood lipid\nvalues, because cholesterol is cholesterol; it\u2019s not good or bad. LDL\nand HDL are lipoproteins, and as a result you can\u2019t consume good\nor bad cholesterol, you consume cholesterol. A more appropriate\ndescriptor for these lipoproteins would be HDL \u201cgood cholesterol\ntransporter\u201d and LDL \u201cbad cholesterol transporter.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s so bad about LDL? LDL enters the endothelium where\nit is oxidized. This oxidized LDL is engulfed by white blood cells\n256 | Human Nutrition (macrophages), leading to the formation of what are known as foam\ncells. The foam cells eventually accumulate so much LDL that they\ndie and accumulate, forming a fatty streak. From there the fatty\nstreak, which is the beginning stages of a lesion, can continue to\ngrow until it blocks the artery. This can result in a myocardial\ninfarction (heart attack) or a stroke. HDL is good in that it scavenges\ncholesterol from other lipoproteins or cells and returns it to the\nliver. The figure below shows the formation of the fatty streak and\nhow this can progress to a point where it greatly alters blood flow.\nFigure 4.718 The formation of a lesion in an artery5\nMacronutrient Uptake, Absorption & Transport | 257 The video below does an excellent job of illustrating this process.\nHowever there are two caveats to point out. First, it incorrectly\nrefers to cholesterol (LDL-C etc.), and second, it is clearly made\nby a drug company, so keep these factors in mind.

This results in a\nlesion known as a peptic ulcer, as shown below.\nFigure 5.11 A peptic ulcer in the duodenum1\nThe first video says that goblet cells secrete mucus in the stomach.\nThis is not correct; they secrete mucus in the intestine. It should be\nneck cells in the stomach. The second link shows what two ulcers\nactually look like in the stomach.\nWeb Links\nVideo: Gastric Ulcers (1:21)\nVideo: Endoscopy of Two Giant Gastric Ulcers (0:26)\nCommon Digestive Problems | 261 10% of Americans will develop an ulcer in their lifetime. Despite\ncommon beliefs, these ulcers are not caused by stress or spicy\nfoods. Most ulcers are believed to be caused by the acid-resistant\nbacteria, Helicobacter pylori. 30-40% of Americans are infected with\nthis bacteria. Helicobacter pylori causes a thinning of the mucus\nthat protects the stomach and duodenum from gastric acid. It is\nnot clear how Helicobacter pylori is transmitted, though it may be\nthrough contaminated food or water. It might also be spread\nthrough contact with vomit, feces, or saliva of an infected person1.\nProlonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)\nsuch as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen (Aleve) are also frequent\ncauses of peptic ulcers. NSAIDs inhibit the production of a\nprotective eicosanoid1.\nReferences & Links\n1.http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/\ndigestive-diseases/peptic-ulcer/Pages/definition-facts.aspx\nVideos\nGastric Ulcers \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=98JaiKH2q3E\nEndoscopy of Two Giant Gastric Ulcers \u2013\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHcpzCnjGQ&feature=related\n5.2 Gallstones\nIt is estimated that up to 1 million Americans are hospitalized\nannually as a result of gallstones, making it the most common of\nall digestive diseases1. Gallstones are formed when bile hardens\nin the gallbladder. 80% of gallstones are a result of cholesterol\nprecipitation, while 20% are are a result of bile pigment\nprecipitation2. The cause of gallstones is unknown2. The way in\nwhich gallstones are formed is shown in the following video.\n262 | Human Nutrition Web Link\nVideo: Gallstones (0:27)\nThe following figure shows a severe case of gallstones.\nFigure 5.21 Gallstones within a dissected gallbladder3\nMany people do not experience symptoms from gallstones. They are\nusually discovered during examination for another health condition.\nHowever, some people experience an \u201cattack\u201d or pain that results\nfrom blockage of the bile ducts. The gallbladder is not essential,\nso the primary treatment is cholecystectomy, the removal of the\ngallbladder. Bile then flows directly from the liver into the small\nintestine.\nReferences & Links\n1. Bar-Meir S. (2001) Gallstones: Prevalence, diagnosis and\ntreatment.

A\nsyndrome is a group of symptoms, not a disease. In IBS, the colon\ndoes not function correctly. The symptoms of IBS are cramping,\nbloating, gas, diarrhea, and/or constipation. The cause of IBS is\nunknown. Diet changes, stress reduction, and medicine may help\nmanage the condition1. To learn more about IBS, see the reference\nbelow.\nReference\n1. http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/\ndigestive-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome/pages/\ndefinition-facts.aspx\n5.4 Inflammatory Bowel Disease\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a number of\ninflammatory conditions in the intestine. The two most common\nare Crohn\u2019s Disease and ulcerative colitis. These two conditions\ndiffer mainly in the areas of the intestine that are affected. Crohn\u2019s\ndisease can occur anywhere throughout the GI tract, but most\ncommonly occurs in the last part of the ileum. Crohn\u2019s disease may\nalso involve all layers of the intestine1. Ulcerative colitis are ulcers,\nor sores, in the lining of the colon and/or rectum2. It is estimated\nthat up to 1 million people have IBD in the United States. Half\n264 | Human Nutrition of these individuals have Crohn\u2019s disease, and the other half have\nulcerative colitis3.\nThe figure in the link below illustrates the differences between\nthese two conditions.\nWeb Links\nUlcerative Colitis vs. Crohn\u2019s Disease\nThe exact causes of these two diseases is not known. One\nhypothesized cause is an overactive immune system (autoimmune\nresponse, the immune system attack tissues/cells rather than\npathogens) that results in the chronic inflammation and collateral\ndamage to the cells of the intestine, resulting in formation of lesions.\nCrohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis present symptoms similar\nto other gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome\nand GERD.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/\ndigestive-diseases/crohns-disease/Pages/facts.aspx\n2.http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/\ndigestive-diseases/ulcerative-colitis/Pages/facts.aspx\n3. http://www.ccfa.org/info/about/crohns\nLinks\nUlcerative Colitis vs. Crohn\u2019s Disease \u2013 http://www.quibd.com/\nwp-content/uploads/2015/08/DIFFERENCES001.jpg\nCommon Digestive Problems | 265 5.5 Celiac Disease & Gluten\n1 out of every 133 people in the United States has celiac disease1.\nPeople with celiac disease cannot consume the protein gluten\nbecause it causes their body to generate an autoimmune response\n(immune cells attack the body\u2019s own cells) that causes damage to the\nvilli in the intestine, as shown below.\nFigure 5.51 Different stages of celiac disease2\nThis damage to the villi impairs the absorption of macronutrients\nand micronutrients from food.\nThere are a variety of symptoms for celiac disease that vary\ndepending on age and from person to person. For a listing of all\nsymptoms, see the first link below. The second link describes the\ndifficulty in diagnosing this disease, which is reinforced by the the\nthird video link.\nWhat is gluten?\nGluten is a protein that is bound to starch in the endosperm of\ngrains such as:\nWheat\nBarley\nRye\nTriticale\n266 | Human Nutrition Figure 5.51 Parts of a wheat granule3\nThe video below does a nice job of providing some more information\nabout this disease.\nCommon Digestive Problems | 267 Gluten-free diets have been increasing in popularity even for\npeople who don\u2019t have celiac disease. The thinking among those\nconsuming these diets is that they might be non-celiac gluten-\nsensitive, meaning that they experience adverse effects from\nconsuming it. However, as the study describes, it seems more likely\nthat it is fructan, a fructooligosaccharide, that causes these issues\nas found in the research described in the abstract below. These\nare apart of fermentable oligosaccharides-, disaccharides,\nmonosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). Low FODMAP diets are\nincreasing in use for similar reasons as gluten-free diets were used,\nbut there is better evidence justification for their use.\nWeb Link\nFructan, Rather Than Gluten, Induces Symptoms in Patients With Self-\nReported Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity\nReferences & Links\n1. http://www.celiac.org/\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coeliac_Disease.png\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wheat_seed.jpg\nLinks\nFructan, Rather Than Gluten, Induces Symptoms in Patients With\nSelf-Reported Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29102613#\n5.6 Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis\nApproximately 10% of people under 40, and 50% of people over\n60 years old have a condition known as diverticulosis1. In this\ncondition, diverticula (plural, diverticulum singular), or outpouches,\nare formed at weak points in the large intestine, primarily in the\n268 | Human Nutrition lowest section of the sigmoid colon, as nicely shown in the figure\nbelow and in the video in the web link below.\nFigure 5.61 Diverticula on the large\nintestine1\nWeb Link\nVideo: Diverticulosis (1:24)\nIt is believed that diverticula are formed as a result of a low-fiber\ndiet because people may strain more during bowel movements.\nMost people with diverticulosis do not know that they have the\ncondition. However, if the pouches become inflamed, then the\ncondition is known as diverticulitis. The most common symptom of\nthis condition is abdominal pain. A liquid diet may be needed until\nthe inflammation is decreased, then fiber is gradually increased1.\nReferences & Links\n1.http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/\ndigestive-diseases/diverticular-disease/Pages/facts.aspx#1\nVideo\nCommon Digestive Problems | 269 A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the\ntext.

An internal hemorrhoid occurs within the anus, while an\nexternal hemorrhoid occurs in the skin surrounding the anus.\nSymptoms of hemorrhoids include bleeding, pain during bowel\nmovements, and/or itching1. It is estimated that \u201cabout 75% of\npeople will have hemorrhoids at some point in their lives\u201d2.\n270 | Human Nutrition Figure 5.71 Hemorrhoids3\nThe first 55 seconds of the following video does a nice job of\nillustrating what hemorrhoids are and how they develop.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Hemorrhoids (2:05)\nThe anus and lower rectum experience high pressure during bowel\nmovements. Thus, hemorrhoids are believed to be caused by\nstraining during bowel movements. To prevent this condition from\noccurring, it is recommended that people consume a high-fiber\ndiet, drink plenty of water, and exercise to produce regular, large,\nsoft stools. In addition, people should \u201cgo\u201d at first urge and not wait\nuntil it is more than an urge2.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hemorrhoids-topic-\nCommon Digestive Problems | 271 overview\n2. http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/\ndigestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/Pages/facts.aspx\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hemorrhoid.png\nVideo\nHemorrhoids \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=C8vZoIhQCwU\n272 | Human Nutrition Macronutrient & Alcohol\nMetabolism\nNow that we have digested, taken up, absorbed, and transported the\nmacronutrients, the next step is to learn how these macronutrients\nare metabolized. Alcohol is also included at the end of this chapter,\neven though it is not a macronutrient.\nSections:\n6.1 Metabolism Basics\n6.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism\n6.3 Lipid Metabolism\n6.4 Protein Metabolism\n6.5 Alcohol Metabolism\n6.1 Metabolism Basics\nMetabolism consists of all the chemical processes that occur in\nliving cells. These processes/reactions can generally be classified\nas either anabolic or catabolic. Anabolic means to build, catabolic\nmeans to breakdown. If you have trouble remembering the\ndifference between the two, remember that anabolic steroids are\nwhat are used to build enormous muscle mass.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol\nMetabolism | 273 Figure 6.11 One of these two is taking anabolic steroids, which one would be\nyour guess?\nAn anabolic reaction/pathway requires energy to build something.\nA catabolic reaction/pathway generates energy by breaking down\nsomething. This is shown in the example below of glucose and\nglycogen. The same is true for other macronutrients.\n274 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.12 The breakdown of glycogen to glucose is catabolic. The glucose can\nthen be used to produce energy. The synthesis of glycogen from glucose is\nanabolic and requires energy.\nAnabolic and catabolic can also be used to describe conditions in\nthe body. For instance, after a meal there is often a positive energy\nbalance, or there is more energy and macronutrients than the body\nneeds at that time. Thus, some energy needs to be stored and the\nmacronutrients will be used for synthesis, such as amino acids being\nused for protein synthesis. However, after a fast, or a prolonged\nperiod without energy intake, the body is in negative energy balance\nand is considered catabolic. In this condition, macronutrients will\nbe mobilized from their stores to be used to generate energy. For\nexample, if prolonged enough, protein can be broken down, then\nthe released amino acids can be broken down to be used as an\nenergy source.\nA number of the metabolic reactions oxidize or reduce\ncompounds. A compound that is being oxidized loses at least one\nelectron, while a compound that is reduced gains at least 1 electron.\nTo remember the difference, a mnemonic device such as OIL\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 275 (oxidation is lost), RIG (reduction is gained) is helpful. Oxidation-\nreduction reactions are illustrated in the figure below.\nFigure 6.13 The purple compound is being oxidized, the orange compound is\nbeing reduced1\nAnother way to remember oxidation versus reduction is LEO goes\nGER (like a lion)\nLose Elections = Oxidize\nGain Elections = Reduce\nIron is a good example we can use to illustrate oxidation-\nreduction reactions. Iron commonly exists in two oxidation states\n(Fe3+ or Fe2+). It is constantly oxidized/reduced back and forth\nbetween the two states. The oxidation/reduction of iron is shown\nbelow.\n\\begin{align}\n\\ce{Fe^{3+} + e^- \u2192 Fe^{2+} Reduced}\n\\ce{Fe^{2+} \u2192 Fe^{3+} + e^- Oxidized}\n\\end{align}\n276 | Human Nutrition However, some oxidation reduction reactions are not as easy to\nrecognize. There are some simple rules to help you recognize less\nobvious oxidation/reduction reactions that are based upon the gain\nor loss of oxygen or hydrogen. These are as follows:\nOxidation: gains oxygen or loses hydrogen\nReduction: loses oxygen or gains hydrogen\nReferences\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nImage:Gulf_Offshore_Platform.jpg\n6.11 Cofactors\nA number of enzymes require cofactors to function. Some also\nrequire what other textbooks and resources refer to as coenzymes.\nBut to keep things simple, we are going to include these coenzymes\nin our definition of cofactors. Thus, cofactors can be either organic\nor inorganic molecules that are required by enzymes to function.\nMany organic cofactors are vitamins or molecules derived from\nvitamins. Most inorganic cofactors are minerals. Cofactors can be\noxidized or reduced for the enzymes to catalyze the reactions.\nTwo common cofactors that are derived from the B vitamins,\nniacin and riboflavin, are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)\nand flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), respectively. The structure of\nNAD and FAD are shown below.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 277 Figure 6.111 Structure of NAD1 upside down. The atoms are circled to help\norient this structure with Figure 6.113\n278 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.112 Structure of FAD2. The nitrogens are circled to help orient this\nstructure with Figure 6.114\nBoth of these cofactors can be reduced; NAD is reduced to form\nNADH, while FAD is reduced to form FADH2 as shown in the 2\nfigures below.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 279 Figure 6.113 The reduction of NAD to form NADH3\nFigure 6.114 The reduction of FAD4 to FADH2\nAn example of a mineral that serves as a cofactor is Fe2+ for proline\nand lysyl hydroxylases. We will discuss later in detail why vitamin C\n(ascorbic acid) is needed to reduce iron to Fe2+ so that it can serve\nas a cofactor for proline and lysyl hydroxylases.\n280 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.115 Iron (Fe2+) is a cofactor for proline and lysyl hydroxylases\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NAD%2B_phys.svg\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide.png\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:NAD_oxidation_reduction.svg\n4. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:FAD_FADH2_equlibrium.png\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 281 6.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism Pathways\nThere are many metabolic pathways/cycles/processes/reactions\nthat are involved in the synthesis or degradation of carbohydrates\nand compounds formed from them. Please note that most of these\npathways aren\u2019t specific to carbohydrates only.

The figure below reminds you\nthat in the liver, galactose and fructose have been phosphorylated.\nFigure 6.211 Uptake of monosaccharides into the hepatocyte\nGalactose\nIn the liver, galactose-1-phosphate is converted to\nglucose-1-phosphate, before finally being converted to\nglucose-6-phosphate1. As shown below, glucose 6-phosphate can\nthen be used in either glycolysis or glycogenesis, depending on the\nperson\u2019s current energy state.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 283 Figure 6.212 Conversion of galactose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate\nFructose\nUnlike galactose, fructose cannot be used to form\nphosphorylated glucose. Instead, fructose-1-phosphate is cleaved in\nthe liver to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a glycolysis (pathway\nthat breaks down glucose) intermediate . This occurs through\nmultiple steps, as depicted below.\n284 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.213 Conversion of fructose-1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate\nGlucose-6-Phosphate\nWithin hepatocytes or myocytes (muscle cells),\nglucose-6-phosphate can be used either for glycogenesis (glycogen\nsynthesis) or glycolysis (breakdown of glucose for energy\nproduction). If the person is in an anabolic state, they will use\nglucose-6-phosphate for storage. If they are in a catabolic state,\nthey will use it for energy production.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 285 Figure 6.214 The \u201cfork in the road\u201d for glucose-6-phosphate\nReferences & Links\n1. Gropper SS, Smith JL, Groff JL. (2008) Advanced nutrition and\nhuman metabolism. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing.\n6.22 Glycogenesis & Glycogenolysis\nAs discussed earlier, glycogen is the animal storage form of glucose.\nIf a person is in an anabolic state, such as after consuming a meal,\nmost glucose-6-phosphate within the myocytes (muscle cells) or\nhepatocytes (liver cells) is going to be stored as glycogen. The\nstructure is shown below as a reminder.\n286 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.221 Structure of glycogen1\nGlycogen is mainly stored in the liver and the muscle. It makes\nup ~6% of the wet weight of the liver and only 1% of muscle wet\nweight. However, since we have far more muscle mass in our body,\nthere is 3-4 times more glycogen stored in muscle than in the\nliver2. We have limited glycogen storage capacity. Thus, after a\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 287 high-carbohydrate meal, our glycogen stores will reach capacity.\nAfter glycogen stores are filled, glucose will have to be metabolized\nin different ways for it to be stored in a different form.\nGlycogenesis\nThe synthesis of glycogen from glucose is a process known as\nglycogenesis. Glucose-6-phosphate is not inserted directly into\nglycogen in this process. There are a couple of steps before it is\nincorporated. First, glucose-6-phosphate is converted to\nglucose-1-phosphate and then converted to uridine diphosphate\n(UDP)-glucose. UDP-glucose is inserted into glycogen by either the\nenzyme, glycogen synthase (alpha-1,4 bonds), or the branching\nenzyme (alpha-1,6 bonds) at the branch points3.\nFigure 6.222 Glycogenesis\nGlycogenolysis\nThe process of liberating glucose from glycogen is known as\nglycogenolysis. This process is essentially the opposite of\nglycogenesis with two exceptions: (1) there is no UDP-glucose step,\nand (2) a different enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase, is involved.\nGlucose-1-phosphate is cleaved from glycogen by the enzyme,\nglycogen phosphorylase, which then can be converted to\nglucose-6-phosphate as shown below3.\n288 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.223 Glycogenolysis\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Glycogen.png\n2.

Energy harvesting step \u2013 1 NADH and 2 ATPs are produced\nfrom each 3 carbon molecule (there are two 3 carbon\nmolecules formed from each glucose).\nFigure 6.235 Glycolysis step 3, energy harvesting1\n292 | Human Nutrition Thus, from a molecule of glucose, the harvesting step produces a\ntotal of four ATPs and two NADHs. Subtracting the harvesting from\nthe investment step, the net output from one molecule of glucose is\ntwo ATPs and two NADHs.\nThe figure below shows the stages of glycolysis, as well as the\ntransition reaction, citric acid cycle, and electron transport chain\nthat are utilized by cells to produce energy.

If there are not adequate oxygen\nlevels (anaerobic conditions), pyruvate will instead be used to\nproduce lactate in the cytoplasm. We are going to focus on the\naerobic pathway to begin with, then we will address what happens\nunder anaerobic conditions in the anaerobic respiration section.\nFigure 6.241 Pyruvate fork in the road. What happens depends on whether it\nis aerobic or anaerobic respiration1\n294 | Human Nutrition The transition reaction is the transition between glycolysis and\nthe citric acid cycle. The transition reaction converts pyruvate (3\ncarbons) to acetyl CoA (2 carbons), producing carbon dioxide (CO2)\nand a NADH as shown below. The figure below shows the transition\nreaction with CoA and NAD entering, and acetyl-CoA, CO2, and\nNADH being produced.\nFigure 6.242 Transition reaction2\nThe acetyl is combined with coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl-CoA.\nThe structure of CoA is shown below.\nFigure 6.243 Structure of coenzyme A3\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 295 Thus, for one molecule of glucose, the transition reaction produces\n2 acetyl-CoAs, 2 molecules of CO2, and 2 NADHs.\nReferences & Links\n1. https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria#/media/\nFile:Animal_mitochondrion_diagram_en_(edit).svg\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nImage:Citric_acid_cycle_with_aconitate_2.svg\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Coenzym_A.svg\n6.25 The Citric Acid Cycle\nAcetyl-CoA is a central point in metabolism, meaning there are\na number of ways that it can be used. We\u2019re going to continue to\nconsider its use in an aerobic, catabolic state (need energy). Under\nthese conditions, acetyl-CoA will enter the citric acid cycle (aka\nKrebs Cycle, TCA Cycle). The following figure shows the citric acid\ncycle.\nFigure 6.251 The citric acid cycle1\n296 | Human Nutrition The citric acid cycle begins by acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) combining\nwith oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to form citrate (aka citric acid, 6\ncarbons). A series of transformations occur before a carbon is given\noff as carbon dioxide and NADH is produced. This leaves alpha-\nketoglutarate (5 carbons). Another carbon is given off as CO2 to\nform succinyl CoA (4 carbons) and produce another NADH. In the\nnext step, one guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is produced as\nsuccinyl-CoA is converted to succinate. GTP is readily converted to\nATP, thus this step is essentially the generation of 1 ATP. In the next\nstep, an FADH2 is produced along with fumarate. Then, after more\nsteps, another NADH is produced as oxaloacetate is regenerated.\nThus, the net output from one cycle is:\n2 CO2\n3 NADH\n1 FADH2\n1 GTP (converted to ATP)\nThe two carbons that are given off as CO2 originally came from\nacetyl-CoA.\nThe first video and the animation do a good job of explaining and\nillustrating how the cycle works.

More specifically, the electron transport chain takes\nthe energy from the electrons on NADH and FADH2 to pump\nprotons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This creates a proton\ngradient between the intermembrane space (high) and the matrix\n(low) of the mitochondria. ATP synthase uses the energy from this\ngradient to synthesize ATP. Oxygen is required for this process\nbecause it serves as the final electron acceptor, forming water.\nCollectively this process is known as oxidative phosphorylation.

Remember that this is aerobic and requires oxygen to be the\nfinal electron acceptor. If 3 ATP/NADH and 2 ATP/FADH2 are used\ninstead of 2.5 ATP/NADH and 1.5 ATP/FADH2 that were used above,\ntotal ATP and percentage of ATP produced by the electron transport\nchain would be different.

Without the electron transport\nchain functioning, all NAD has been reduced to NADH and glycolysis\ncannot continue to produce ATP from glucose.\nFigure 6.282 Why NAD needs to be regenerated under anaerobic conditions2\nThus, there is a workaround to regenerate NAD by converting\npyruvate (pyruvic acid) to lactate (lactic acid) as shown below.\nFigure 6.283. The conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid regenerates NAD3,4\n304 | Human Nutrition However, anaerobic respiration only produces 2 ATP per molecule\nof glucose, compared to 32 ATP for aerobic respiration.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)\n2. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)\nDespite performing the same function, at the adipose level, the\nenzymes are primarily active for seemingly opposite reasons. In\nthe fed state, LPL on the endothelium of blood vessels cleaves\nlipoprotein triglycerides into fatty acids so that they can be taken\nup into adipocytes, for storage as triglycerides, or myocytes where\nthey are primarily used for energy production. This action of LPL on\nlipoproteins is shown in the two figures below.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 307 Figure 6.312 Lipoprotein lipase cleaves fatty acids from the chylomicron,\nforming a chylomicron remnant.\nFigure 6.313 Lipoprotein lipase cleaves triglycerides from VLDL and IDL,\nforming subsequent lipoproteins (IDL and LDL) that contain less triglyceride\nHSL is an important enzyme in adipose tissue, which is a major\nstorage site of triglycerides in the body. HSL activity is increased by\nglucagon and epinephrine (\u201cfight or flight\u201d hormone), and decreased\nby insulin. Thus, in hypoglycemia (such as during a fast) or a \u201cfight or\nflight\u201d response, triglycerides in the adipose are cleaved, releasing\n308 | Human Nutrition fatty acids into circulation that then bind with the transport protein\nalbumin. Thus, HSL is important for mobilizing fatty acids so they\ncan be used to produce energy. The figure below shows how fatty\nacids can be taken up and used by tissues such as the muscle for\nenergy production1.\nFigure 6.314 Hormone-sensitive lipase\nWe are not going to focus on glycerol, but it does have two\nmetabolic fates.\n1.

This\nprocess occurs in the mitochondria, but long chain fatty acids\ncannot diffuse across the mitochondrial membrane (similar to\nabsorption into the enterocyte). Carnitine, an amino acid-derived\ncompound, helps shuttle long-chain fatty acids into the\nmitochondria. The structure of carnitine is shown below.\n310 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.321 Carnitine shuttles fatty acids into the mitochondria1,2\nFatty Acid Shuttling\nAs shown below, there are two enzymes involved in this process:\ncarnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI) and carnitine\npalmitoyltransferase II (CPTII). CPTI is located on the outer\nmitochondrial membrane, CPTII is located on the inner\nmitochondrial membrane. The fatty acid is first activated by\naddition of a CoA (forming acyl-CoA), then CPTI adds carnitine.\nAcyl-Carnitine is then transported into the mitochondrial matrix\nwith the assistance of the enzyme translocase. In the matrix, CPTII\nremoves carnitine from the activated fatty acid (acyl-CoA).\nCarnitine is recycled back into the cytosol to be used again, as\nshown in the figure and animation below.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 311 Figure 6.322 Transfer of fatty acids into the mitochondria3\nWeb Link\nFatty acid transfer from cytoplasm to mitochondria\nFatty Acid Activation\nAs shown below, the first step of fatty acid oxidation is activation.\nA CoA molecule is added to the fatty acid to produce acyl-CoA,\nconverting ATP to AMP in the process. Note that in this step, the\nATP is converted to AMP, not ADP. Thus, activation uses the\nequivalent of 2 ATP molecules4.\n312 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.323 Fatty Acid Oxidation\nFatty Acid Oxidation\nFatty acid oxidation is also referred to as beta-oxidation because 2\ncarbon units are cleaved off at the beta-carbon position (2nd carbon\nfrom the acid end) of an activated fatty acid. The cleaved 2 carbon\nunit forms acetyl-CoA and produces an activated fatty acid (acyl-\nCoA) with 2 fewer carbons, acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2.\nTo completely oxidize the 18-carbon fatty acid above, 8 cycles of\nbeta-oxidation have to occur. This will produce:\n9 acetyl-CoAs\n8 NADH\n8 FADH2\nThose 9 acetyl-CoAs can continue into the citric acid cycle, where\nthey can produce:\n9 GTP\n9 FADH2\n27 NADH\nThe products of the complete oxidation of a fatty acid are shown\nbelow.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 313 Figure 6.324 Complete oxidation of a 18 carbon (C) fatty acid\nAdding up the NADH and FADH2, the electron transport chain ATP\nproduction from beta-oxidation and the citric acid cycle looks like\nthis:\nNADH\n8 (beta-oxidation) + 27 (TCA) = 35 NADH X 2.5 ATP/NADH = 87.5\nATP\nFADH2\n8 (beta-oxidation) + 9 (TCA) = 17 FADH2 X 1.5 ATP/FADH2 = 25.5\nATP\nGTP\n9 GTP = 9 ATP\nTotal ATP from complete oxidation of an 18 carbon fatty acid:\n87.5 + 25.5 + 9 = 122 ATP\nSubtract 2 ATP (ATP\u2013>AMP) required for activation of the fatty\nacid:\n122-2 = 120 Net ATP\nCompared to glucose (32 ATP) you can see that there is far more\nenergy stored in a fatty acid. This is because fatty acids are in a more\n314 | Human Nutrition reduced form and thus, they yield 9 kcal/g instead of 4 kcal/g like\ncarbohydrates4.\nThe following animation reviews lipolysis and beta-oxidation.\nWeb Link\nFatty Acid Metabolism\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carnitine_structure.png\n2. https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria#/media/\nFile:Animal_mitochondrion_diagram_en_(edit).svg\n3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nCarnitine_palmitoyltransferase_I#/media/File:Acyl-\nCoA_from_cytosol_to_the_mitochondrial_matrix.svg\n4.

Acetyl-CoA has to first move out of the mitochondria, where\nit is then converted to malonyl-CoA (3 carbons). Malonyl-CoA then\nis combined with another acetyl-CoA to form a 4 carbon fatty acid\n(1 carbon is given off as CO2). The addition of 2 carbons is repeated\nthrough a similar process 7 times to produce a 16 carbon fatty acid1.\nFigure 6.331 Fatty acid synthesis2\nMost fatty acids synthesized will be esterified into triglycerides for\nstorage.\nReferences\n1.

As shown below,\nthere are a large number of reactions and enzymes involved in\ncholesterol synthesis.\nFigure 6.351 Cholesterol synthesis pathway1\n320 | Human Nutrition Simplifying this, acetyl-CoA is converted to acetoacetyl-CoA (4\ncarbons) before forming 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-\nCoA). HMG-CoA is converted to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-\nCoA reductase. This enzyme is important because it is the\nrate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.\nFigure 6.352 Cholesterol synthesis simplified2\nA rate-limiting enzyme is like a bottleneck in a highway, as shown\nbelow, that determines the flow of traffic past it.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 321 Figure 6.353 Bottleneck in traffic3\nRate-limiting enzymes limit the rate at which a metabolic pathway\nproceeds. The pharmaceutical industry has taken advantage of this\nknowledge to lower people\u2019s LDL levels with drugs known as statins.\nThese drugs inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and thus decrease\n322 | Human Nutrition cholesterol synthesis.

Now statins are\nprescribed at set therapeutic doses based on assessed\ncardiovascular risk rather than based off LDL and HDL target levels.\nIt is also recommended that only statins that have been shown to\ndecrease cardiovascular disease risk be used, some have only been\nshown to improve LDL/HDL levels. The link below is to the online\ncalculator that can be used to estimate individual\u2019s risk. The third\nlink talks about a drug that was effective at lowering LDL, increasing\nHDL, but did not improve cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Thus, this\nsection will focus on how proteins and amino acids are broken\ndown. There are four protein metabolic pathways that will be\ncovered in this section:\nTransamination\n-transfer of an amino group from one amino acid to another\nDeamination\n-removal of an amino group, normally from an amino acid.\nGluconeogenesis\n-synthesis of glucose from a non-carbohydrate source.\nProtein Turnover/Degradation\n-liberation of amino acids from proteins.\nSubsections:\n6.41 Transamination, Deamination, & Ammonia Removal as Urea\n6.42 Gluconeogenesis\n6.43 Protein Turnover/Degradation\n324 | Human Nutrition 6.41 Transamination, Deamination & Ammonia\nRemoval as Urea\nThe first step in catabolizing, or breaking down, an amino acid is the\nremoval of its amine group (-NH3). Amine groups can be transferred\nor removed through transamination or deamination, respectively.\nTransamination\nTransamination is the transfer of an amine group from an amino\nacid to a keto acid (amino acid without an amine group), thus\ncreating a new amino acid and keto acid as shown below.\nFigure 6.411 Generic transamination reaction where the top\nketo acid is converted to an amino acid, while the bottom\namino acid is converted to a keto acid1\nKeto acids and/or carbon skeletons are what remains after amino\nacids have had their nitrogen group removed by deamination or\ntransamination. Transamination is used to synthesize nonessential\namino acids.\nDeamination\nDeamination is the removal of the amine group as ammonia (NH3),\nas shown below.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 325 Figure 6.412 Deamination of cytosine to uracil (nucleotides, not amino acids)2\nThe potential problem with deamination is that too much ammonia\nis toxic, causing a condition known as hyperammonemia. The\nsymptoms of this condition are shown in the following figure.\n326 | Human Nutrition Figure 6.413 Symptoms of Hyperammonemia3\nOur body has a method to safely package ammonia in a less toxic\nform to be excreted. This safer compound is urea, which is\nproduced by the liver using 2 molecules of ammonia (NH3) and 1\nmolecule of carbon dioxide (CO2). Most urea is then secreted from\nthe liver and incorporated into urine in the kidney to be excreted\nfrom the body, as shown below.\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 327 Figure 6.414 Production of urea helps to safely remove ammonia from the\nbody4-6\nReferences\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Transaminierung.svg\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DesaminierungCtoU.png\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Symptoms_of_hyperammonemia.svg\n4. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Liver.svg\n5. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/\nKidney_section.jpg\n6. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Urea.png\n328 | Human Nutrition 6.42 Gluconeogenesis\nGluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate\nsources. Certain amino acids can be used for this process, which\nis the reason that this section is included here instead of the\ncarbohydrate metabolism section. Gluconeogenesis is glycolysis in\nreverse with an oxaloacetate workaround, as shown below.\nRemember oxaloacetate is also an intermediate in the citric acid\ncycle.\nFigure 6.421 Gluconeogenesis is glycolysis in reverse with an oxaloacetate\nworkaround1\nNot all amino acids can be used for gluconeogenesis. The ones that\ncan be used are termed glucogenic (red), and can be converted to\neither pyruvate or a citric acid cycle intermediate. Other amino\nacids can only be converted to either acetyl-CoA or acetoacetyl-\nCoA, which cannot be used for gluconeogenesis. However, acetyl-\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 329 CoA or acetoacetyl-CoA can be used for ketogenesis to synthesize\nthe ketone bodies, acetone and acetoacetate. Thus, these amino\nacids are instead termed ketogenic (green).\nFigure 6.422 Glucogenic (red), ketogenic (green), and glucogenic and ketogenic\namino acids2\nFatty acids and ketogenic amino acids cannot be used to synthesize\nglucose. The transition reaction is a one-way reaction, meaning that\nacetyl-CoA cannot be converted back to pyruvate. As a result, fatty\nacids can\u2019t be used to synthesize glucose, because beta-oxidation\nproduces acetyl-CoA. Even if acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle,\nthe carbons from it will eventually be completely oxidized and given\noff as CO2. The net result is that these carbons are not readily\navailable to serve as keto-acids or carbon skeletons for amino acid\nsynthesis. Some amino acids can be either glucogenic or ketogenic,\ndepending on how they are metabolized. These amino acids are\nreferred to as glucogenic and ketogenic (pink).\nReferences\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CellRespiration.svg\n330 | Human Nutrition 2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amino_acid_catabolism.png\n6.43 Protein Turnover/Degradation\nProteins serve a number of functions in the body, but what happens\nwhen cells, enzymes, etc. have completed their lifespan? They are\nrecycled.\nFigure 6.431 Recycling symbol1\nProteins are broken down to amino acids that can be used to\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 331 synthesize new proteins. There are 3 main systems of protein\ndegradation:\n1. Ubiquitin-proteasome degradation\n2. Lysosome degradation\n3. Calpain degradation\n1. Ubiquitin-Proteasome Degradation\nProteins that are damaged or abnormal are tagged with the protein\nubiquitin. There are multiple protein subunits involved in the\nprocess (E1-E3), but the net result is the production of a protein\n(substrate) with a ubiquitin tail, as shown below.\nFigure 6.432 Ubiquitination of a protein (substrate)2\nThis protein then moves to the proteasome for degradation.

The alcohol we consume\ncontains two carbons and is known as ethanol.\nFigure 6.51 Structure of ethanol1\nEthanol is passively absorbed by simple diffusion into the\nenterocyte. Ethanol metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, but\n10-30% is estimated to occur in the stomach2. For the average\nperson, the liver can metabolize the amount of ethanol in one drink\n(1/2 ounce) per hour3. There are three ways that alcohol is\nmetabolized in the body.\n1. Catalase \u2013 an enzyme that we will cover again in the\n334 | Human Nutrition antioxidants section. Catalase is estimated to metabolize less\nthan 2% of ethanol, so it is not shown below or discussed\nfurther4.\n2. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) \u2013 This is the major ethanol-\nmetabolizing enzyme that converts ethanol and NAD to\nacetaldehyde and NADH, respectively. Aldehyde\ndehydrogenase (ALDH) uses NAD, CoA, and acetaldehyde to\ncreate acetyl-CoA and to produce another NADH. The action\nof ADH is shown in the figure below.\nFigure 6.52 Ethanol Metabolism1,5\n3. Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) \u2013 When a person\nconsumes a large amount of alcohol the MEOS, is the overflow\npathway, that also metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde. It is\nestimated that the MEOS metabolizes 20% of ethanol3, and it\ndiffers from ADH in that it uses ATP to convert reduced\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH + H+) to\nNADP+. The action of the MEOS is shown in the figure above.\nAt high intakes or with repeated exposure, there is increased\nMacronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 335 synthesis of MEOS enzymes resulting in more efficient metabolism,\nalso known as increased tolerance. ADH levels do not increase based\non alcohol exposure. MEOS also metabolizes a variety of other\ncompounds (drugs, fatty acids, steroids) and alcohol competes for\nthe enzyme\u2019s action. This can cause the metabolism of drugs to slow\nand potentially reach harmful levels in the body3.\nFemales have lower stomach ADH activity and body H2O\nconcentrations. As a result, a larger proportion of ethanol reaches\ncirculation, thus, in general, females have a lower tolerance for\nalcohol. About 50% of Taiwanese, Han Chinese, and Japanese\npopulations have polymorphisms in ALDH which cause the enzyme\nto have low activity6. This leads to buildup of acetaldehyde and\nundesirable symptoms such as: flushing, dizziness, nausea, and\nheadaches2. The following short video explains what happens when\nthe MEOS system gets involved in alcohol metabolism.\nWeb Link\nVideo: MEOS Overflow Pathway\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ethanol_flat_structure.png\n2.

However, an integrated understanding of the\ninterconnectedness and tissue specificity of metabolism is where\nthis knowledge really becomes powerful. To this end, we will first\ncover how the different pathways feed into one another and then\ntalk about the metabolic capabilities of the different tissues in the\nbody. We will then discuss what happens metabolically during\ndifferent conditions or when consuming certain diets.\nSections:\n7.1 Integration of Macronutrient & Alcohol Metabolic Pathways\n7.2 Liver Macronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism\n7.3 Extrahepatic Macronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism\n7.4 Metabolic Conditions\n7.1 Integration of Macronutrient and\nAlcohol Metabolic Pathways\nIf you were to draw all the macronutrient and alcohol metabolic\npathways covered in chapter 6, hopefully it would look something\nlike the figure below.

However, there are two major macronutrient\nmetabolic processes, lactate synthesis and ketone body breakdown,\nthat the liver will not normally perform, as shown in the figure\nbelow.\nFigure 7.21 Ketone body breakdown and lactate synthesis are major\nmacronutrient metabolic pathways that the liver does not normally perform1\nBut aside from those two pathways, the liver performs all the other\nmetabolic pathways that you have learned about that are listed and\nshown below:\nGlycogen synthesis and breakdown\n342 | Human Nutrition Glycolysis\nGluconeogenesis\nAlcohol oxidation\nKetone body synthesis\nFatty acid synthesis and breakdown\nTriglyceride synthesis and breakdown\nProtein synthesis and breakdown\nUrea synthesis\nVLDL synthesis\nGlucose-6-phosphatase\nFigure 7.22 Metabolic capability of the liver1\nThe liver is the only tissue that performs the following functions:\nKetone body synthesis\nUrea synthesis\nVLDL synthesis\nIntegration of Macronutrient & Alcohol Metabolism | 343 The liver is also the primary, but not exclusive site, of the\nfollowing functions:\nAlcohol oxidation (also occurs in the stomach)\nGluconeogenesis (also occurs in the kidney(s))\nGlucose-6-phosphatase activity (also occurs in the kidney(s))\nLactate breakdown (also occurs in muscle)2\nGlucose-6-phosphatase is important because it removes the\nphosphate from glucose-6-phosphate so that glucose can be\nreleased into circulation. Kidneys can perform gluconeogenesis and\nhas glucose-6-phosphatase. However, it is estimated that 90% of\nglucose formed from gluconeogenesis is produced by the liver; the\nremaining 10% is produced by the kidney(s). It is also important to\nnote that the muscle does not have this enzyme, so it cannot release\nglucose into circulation3.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CellRespiration.svg\n2.

It is the only\nextrahepatic tissue with significant glycogen stores. However,\nunlike the liver, the muscle cannot secrete glucose after it is taken\nup (no glucose-6-phosphatase). Thus, you can think of the muscle\nas being selfish with glucose.

In fasting, we\u2019re\ngoing to be considering what is happening metabolically during a\nprolonged period without food. This is a catabolic condition. The\nAtkins diet is a carbohydrate-restricted diet, so we are going to\nconsider what happens metabolically when someone is eating a diet\n358 | Human Nutrition that essentially only contains protein and lipids over an extended\nperiod of time. This is an anabolic condition. Finally the Ornish/\nPritikin diet is a very low fat diet, so we\u2019re going to consider what\nhappens metabolically when someone is eating a diet that is\nessentially only carbohydrates and protein over an extended period\nof time. This is an anabolic condition. For each of these conditions,\nwe\u2019re going to consider what is happening in the liver, muscle,\nadipose, and brain.\nNow that you should have an understanding of the glycemic\nresponse and macronutrient metabolism, you should be able to\nunderstand the broader effects of insulin and glucagon that are\nsummarized in the following tables.

These fatty acids will be used to synthesize triglycerides\nfor storage. With glucagon levels high in this condition, hormone-\nsensitive lipase would be active.

Minerals can be divided up\ninto three different categories:\nMacrominerals\nTrace Minerals (aka Microminerals)\nUltratrace Minerals\nThere is not an exact, agreed on definition for how the different\ncategories are defined, but in general they are defined by the\namount required and found in the body such that:\nMicronutrients Overview & Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) | 369 Macrominerals > Trace Minerals > Ultratrace Minerals\nTable 8.21 Alphabetical listing of the 20 minerals and their\nchemical symbols\nMacrominerals Trace Minerals Ultratrace Minerals\nCalcium (Ca) Chromium (Cr) Arsenic (As)\nChloride (Cl)a Copper (Cu) Boron (B)\nMagnesium (Mg) Fluoride (F) Nickel (Ni)\nPhosphorus (P)b Iodine (I) Silicon (Si)\nPotassium (K) Iron (Fe) Vanadium (V)\nSodium (Na) Manganese (Mn)\nMolybdenum (Mo)\nSelenium (Se)\nZinc (Zn)\na Chlorine ion, Cl-\nb Phosphate in body, PO4\nThe table below shows the estimated amount of the\nmacrominerals, trace minerals, and ultratrace minerals found in the\nbody.\nTable 8.22 Amount of different minerals found in the body1\nMacrominerals Trace Minerals Ultratrace\nMinerals\n370 | Human Nutrition Calcium 1200 g Iron 4 g Silicon 1 g\nPhosphorus 780 g Fluoride 3-6 g Boron 17 mg\nPotassium 110-140 g Zinc 2.3 g Nickel 15 mg\nSodium 100 g Copper 70 mg Arsenic 7 mg\nChloride 95 g Selenium 14 mg Vanadium 0.1 mg\nMagnesium 25 g Manganese 12 mg\nIodine 10-20 mg\nMolybdenum 5 mg\nChromium 1-2 mg\nMinerals are elements.

The traditional way is to start with fat-soluble\nvitamins and go down through the vitamins alphabetically (i.e.\nvitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K). However, this method\nleads students to learn about vitamins and minerals more\nindividually instead of how they work together. For instance, it\nmakes sense to cover calcium with vitamin D, and iron with copper\nand zinc. We are going to cover vitamins and minerals based on\ntheir function rather than covering them by whether they are a\nwater-soluble vitamin or trace mineral. The hope is that you will\ngain a more integrative understanding of vitamins and minerals\nfrom this approach.\nHere are the different functional categories that we are going\nto cover. Notice that some micronutrients fit into more than one\nfunctional category. Each vitamin and mineral will be covered only\nin one section, with some mention of its overlap in other section(s)\nin certain cases.\n372 | Human Nutrition Macronutrient 1-Carbon Bones &\nAntioxidants Blood Electrolytes\nMetabolism Metabolism Teeth\nVitamin\nVitamin E Thiamin Folate Vitamin D Sodium\nK\nVitamin C Riboflavin Vitamin B12 Iron Calcium Potassium\nVitamin\nSelenium Niacin Vitamin B6 Vitamin K Chloride\nB6\nPantothenic\nIron Folate Phosphorus Phosphorus\nAcid\nVitamin\nCopper Vitamin B6 Magnesium Magnesium\nB12\nZinc Biotin Copper Fluoride\nManganese Vitamin B12 Calcium Vitamin A\nRiboflavin Vitamin C Iron\nIodine Copper\nManganese Zinc\nMagnesium\nNo References\n8.4 Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are more than numbers in the\ntable, even though that is often how many people view them.

These tables have been updated to include\nthe new RDAs for vitamin D and calcium.\nWeb Link\nDRI Tables (inactive link as of 05/18/2021)\nMost of you are probably familiar with Dietary Guidelines. DRIs\nMicronutrients Overview & Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) | 373 and Dietary Guidelines provide different information for different\naudiences.\nDietary Guidelines provide qualitative advice to the public about\ndiet and chronic disease prevention and maintaining health.\nDRIs provide quantitative advice to professionals about amounts\nof nutrients or food components to be of benefit.\nDRIs are a collective term to refer to these components:\nEstimated Average Requirement (EAR)\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\nAdequate Intake (AI)\nTolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)\nA number of people refer to the UL as simply the \u201cupper limit\u201d,\nleaving off \u201ctolerable\u201d.\nThe RDA is the measure that professionals use to assess the\nquality of people\u2019s diets. It is the requirement estimated to meet the\nneeds of 97.5% of the population. But the RDA is calculated using\nthe EAR. Therefore, the EAR needs to be set before an RDA can be\nset. There must be applicable research in order to set an EAR. An\nEAR is the estimated requirement for 50% of the population (hence\nthe average in its name), as shown in the figure below. On the left\nvertical axis is the risk of inadequacy, and on the bottom of the\nfigure is the observed level of intake that increases from left to right.\nWe will talk about the right axis label in a later figure. Notice that for\nthe EAR, the risk for inadequacy is 0.5 (50%) whereas the RDA the\nrisk of inadequacy is 0.025 (2.5%).\n374 | Human Nutrition Figure 8.41 The EAR meets the needs of 50% of the population, RDA meets the\nneeds of 97.5% of the population.\nThe figure below shows the EAR on the normal distribution and\nsplits out the different standard deviations as percents. Notice that\nfor 50% of population, their adequate intake is below the EAR and\n50% of the population their adequate intake is above the EAR.\nMicronutrients Overview & Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) | 375 Figure 8.42 The EAR meets the needs of 50% of the population as depicted in\nthis normal distribution. SD \u2013 standard deviation\nIf an EAR is set, the formula for setting the RDA is:\nEAR + 2 Standard Deviations = RDA\nThe following figure shows the distribution and how the\npercentages and standard deviation changes from the EAR. Only\n2.5% of the population will have a need above the RDA for a\nparticular nutrient.\n376 | Human Nutrition Figure 8.43 The RDA meets the needs for 97.5% of the population\nFor nutrients lacking the research evidence needed to set an EAR,\nan AI is set instead. An AI is a level that appears to be adequate\nin a defined population or subgroup. As you can see, the EAR is\nadequate for 50% (0.5) of the population and is lower than the RDA.\nThe RDA is adequate for 97.5% (0.025) of the population, and higher\nthan the EAR. The AI level of intake is believed to be between the\nEAR/RDA and the UL, but since it is not research-based, it is not\nexactly known where this level falls as shown below.\nMicronutrients Overview & Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) | 377 Figure 8.44 The AI compared to the other DRI components, the question mark\nand dotted line are meant to indicate that it is not known exactly where the AI\nwould fall relative to an RDA if one was set\nThe last of the DRIs is the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). This is\nthe highest level of daily nutrient intake that is unlikely to pose risk\nof adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the population.\nTo set this, the committee first sets a no observed adverse effect\nlevel (NOAEL) and/or the lowest observed adverse effect level\n(LOAEL). The UL is then set lower based on a number of\nuncertainty/safety factors off the NOAEL or LOAEL as shown below.\nThe right vertical axis is used to represent the risk of an adverse\nevent. Notice the NOAEL at the point where no adverse effects have\nbeen reported. The LOAEL is somewhere above the NOAEL. The UL\nis set at a level where it is believed that people will not experience\nthe selected adverse effect.\n378 | Human Nutrition Figure 8.45 Setting of the UL\nHow are Americans doing in meeting the DRIs?

As you have learned already,\noxidation is the loss of an electron as shown below.\nFigure 9.111 The purple compound is oxidized; the orange compound is\nreduced1\nSome important terms to understand:\nFree Radical \u2013 a molecule with an unpaired electron in its outer\norbital.\nThe following example shows normal oxygen losing an electron\nfrom its outer orbital and thus, becoming an oxygen free radical.\n384 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.112 Normal oxygen is converted to an oxygen free radical by losing\none electron in its outer orbital, leaving one unpaired electron\nFree radicals are highly reactive because they actively seek an\nelectron to stabilize the molecule.\nReactive Oxygen Species (ROS) \u2013 an oxygen-containing, free\nradical species.\nSome of the most common ROS are (\u25cf symbolizes radical):\nSuperoxide (O2\u25cf)\nHydroxyl Radical (\u25cfOH)\nHydrogen Peroxide Radical (HO2\u25cf)\nPeroxyl Radical (ROO2\u25cf)\nAlkoxyl Radical (RO\u25cf)\nOzone (O3)\n1\nSinglet Oxygen (O2)\nHydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)\nOxidative Stress \u2013 the imbalance between the production of\nROS/free radicals and the body\u2019s ability to quench them.\nThe following video does a good job illustrating how free radicals\ncan be formed and quenched by antioxidants.\nWeb Link\nVideo: How Antioxidants Work (4:31), watch first minute\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 385 The following figure shows that inflammation caused by hitting\nyour thumb with a hammer, exposure to UV light, radiation,\nsmoking, and air pollution are all sources of free radicals.\nFigure 9.113 Some sources of free radicals\nFree radicals can be generated by a variety of sources that can be\nclassified as endogenous (within the body) and exogenous sources\n(outside the body).\nSo, we have these free radicals searching for an electron, what\u2019s\nthe big deal? The problem arises if the free radicals oxidize LDL,\nproteins, or DNA as shown below.\n386 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.114 Free radicals can attack LDL, proteins, and DNA2,3\nOxidized LDL is more atherogenic, meaning it is more likely to\ncontribute to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) than\nnormal LDL. Protein oxidation is believed to be involved in the\ndevelopment of cataracts. Cataracts are the clouding of the lens of\nthe eye.

As a\nhumorous introduction, the link below is to a cartoon that shows\nAuntie Oxidant kicking free radicals out of the bloodstream.\nWeb Link\nAuntie Oxidant\nBut it\u2019s not quite that simple. You have probably heard the saying\n\u201ctake one for the team.\u201d Instead of taking one for the team,\nantioxidants \u201cgive one for the team.\u201d The \u2018giving\u2019 is the donation\nof an electron from the antioxidant to a free radical, in order to\nregenerate a stable compound, as shown below.\n388 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.121 Regeneration of normal oxygen from oxygen free radical by the\ndonation of an electron from an antioxidant\nDonating an electron is how vitamins act as antioxidants. Minerals,\non the other hand, are not antioxidants themselves. Instead, they\nare cofactors for antioxidant enzymes.\nThese antioxidant enzymes include:\nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD): uses copper, zinc, and manganese\nas cofactors (there is more than one SOD enzyme); converts\nsuperoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen1.\nCatalase: uses iron as a cofactor; converts hydrogen peroxide to\nwater1.\nGlutathione peroxidase (GPX): is a selenoenzyme that converts\nhydrogen peroxide to water. It can also convert other reactive\noxygen species (ROSs) to water1.\nThe action of these enzymes is shown below.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 389 Figure 9.122 Antioxidant enzymes that use minerals as cofactors\nAntioxidants are thought to work in concert with one another,\nforming what is known as the antioxidant network. An example of\nthe antioxidant network is shown below. Alpha-tocopherol (major\nform of vitamin E in our body) is oxidized, forming an alpha-\ntocopherol radical. This donation of an electron stabilizes reactive\noxygen species. Ascorbate (vitamin C) is then oxidized, forming\ndehydroascorbate to regenerate (reduce) alpha-tocopherol.\nAscorbate is then regenerated by the selenoenzyme thioredoxin\nreductase. This demonstrates how antioxidants can function as a\nnetwork to regenerate one another so they can continue to function\nas antioxidants.\n390 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.123 The theorized antioxidant network2\nReferences & Links\n1.

For\nthe most part, this is for a good reason. Many food companies\nput antioxidant numbers on the packages that sound good to\nconsumers, who have no idea how to interpret them. Thus, it is\nincreasingly important to have an understanding of what a\nmeaningful antioxidant actually is.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 391 A meaningful antioxidant has two characteristics (these are based\non the assumption that the compound is an antioxidant):\n1. Found in appreciable amounts right location where there are\nfree radicals/ROS that need to be quenched\n2. It is not redundant with another antioxidant that is already\nserving as an antioxidant\nWhat do these mean? Let\u2019s consider the example of lycopene and\nvitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), which are both fat-soluble\nantioxidants. In vitro antioxidant assays have found that lycopene\nis 10-fold more effective in quenching singlet oxygen than alpha-\ntocopherol1. However, when you look at the concentrations found\nin the body, there is far more alpha-tocopherol than lycopene. For\nexample:\nLDL on average contains 11.6 molecules of alpha tocopherol and\n0.9 molecules of lycopene. Thus, if we divide alpha tocopherol by\nlycopene 11.6/0.9 we find that there is on average 12.9 times more\nalpha-tocopherol than lycopene1.\nOther examples in the body:\nProstate \u2013 162-fold higher alpha-tocopherol than lycopene\nconcentrations\nSkin \u2013 17 to 269-fold higher alpha-tocopherol than lycopene\nconcentrations\nPlasma \u2013 53-fold higher alpha tocopherol than lycopene\nconcentrations1\nThus, despite the fact that lycopene is a better antioxidant in\nvitro, since the concentration of alpha-tocopherol is so much higher\nin tissues (locations of need), it is likely the more meaningful\nantioxidant. In addition, if lycopene and alpha-tocopherol have\nsimilar antioxidant functions (fat-soluble antioxidants), lycopene\u2019s\npotential antioxidant action is redundant to alpha-tocopherol\u2019s\nantioxidant function and thus, also less likely to be a meaningful\nantioxidant. Indeed, further examination of the literature has not\n392 | Human Nutrition suggested that lycopene can act as an antioxidant in vivo, even\nthough it is a good one in vitro1.\nYou may be wondering \u201cWhat about the in vitro antioxidant\nassays, like the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay\nthat some food and supplement companies are including on their\nlabels?\u201d This is an example of how some companies/businesses\nuse ORAC values to market their product(s). However, the USDA\nremoved its table of ORAC values \u201cdue to mounting evidence that\nthe values indicating antioxidant capacity have no relevance to the\neffects of specific bioactive compounds, including polyphenols on\nhuman health2.\u201d\nWeb Link\nSozo Coffee ORAC Comparison\nHowever, going back to the two characteristics of meaningful\nantioxidants, there really is no evidence that shows that a high\nORAC score leads to any benefit in vivo. This is because the measure\nalso doesn\u2019t take into account characteristics such as bioavailability.\nBioavailability is the amount of a compound that is absorbed or\nreaches circulation. Many of these purported super antioxidants\nhave not been shown to be absorbed or maintained in the body in a\nway that would suggest that they would be meaningful antioxidants.\n5 years after it was removed, industry and suppliers think it has\nbeen a good thing that it is no longer used as indicated in the\nfollowing article.\nWeb Link\nSaying goodbye to ORAC was a good thing for industry, suppliers say\nReferences & Links\n1.

Antioxidants as\nPro-oxidants\nChapter 1 described a clinical trial that found that high-dose beta-\ncarotene supplementation increased lung cancer risk in smokers.\nThis is an example of findings that support that high doses of\nantioxidants may be \u201ctoo much of a good thing\u201d, causing more harm\nthan benefit. The parabolic, or U-shaped figure, below displays how\nthe level of nutrient concentration or intake (x-axis) relates to an\nantioxidant measure (y-axis). The lowest level of antioxidant intake\nor tissue concentration results in nutrient deficiency if the\nantioxidant is essential (vitamins and minerals). Intake levels above\ndeficient, but less than optimal, are referred to as low suboptimal.\nSuboptimal means the levels are not optimal. Thus, low suboptimal\nand high suboptimal sandwich optimal. The high suboptimal level is\nbetween optimal and where the nutrient becomes toxic.\n394 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.142 How the levels of nutrient concentration or intake alters\nantioxidant measures in the body. Adapted from reference 1\nAn example of where this phenomenon has been shown to occur is\nin the dog prostate with toenail selenium concentrations, which are\na good indicator of long-term selenium status1. Researchers found\nthat when they plotted prostate DNA damage (antioxidant measure)\nagainst toenail selenium status (nutrient concentration or intake)\nthat it resulted in a U-shaped curve like the one shown above1.

The difference between tocopherols and tocotrienols\nis that the former have a saturated tail, while the latter have an\nunsaturated tail. Within tocopherols and tocotrienols, the\ndifference between the different forms is the position of the methyl\ngroups on the ring. The 4 different forms within the tocopherol\nand tocotrienols are designated by the Greek letters: alpha, beta,\ngamma, and delta. The difference in these structures is shown in the\nfigures below.\nFigure 9.21 Structures of the different forms of vitamin E\nFor reasons that will be covered in a later subsection, the primary\nform of vitamin E found in the body is alpha-tocopherol. The major,\nand possibly only, function of vitamin E is as an antioxidant. When\nit serves as an antioxidant it forms an alpha-tocopherol radical, as\nshown below.\n396 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.23 Alpha-tocopherol radical1\nAlpha-tocopherol is believed to be the first part of an antioxidant\nnetwork (shown below) where it is oxidized to donate an electron to\nstabilize reactive oxygen species.

The\nfigure below shows the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of\nvitamin E.\n402 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.221 The absorption, metabolism, and excretion of vitamin E\nThe liver contains a protein called alpha-tocopherol transfer\nprotein (alpha-TTP), which is responsible for maintaining higher\nlevels of alpha-tocopherol in the body. Alpha-TTP preferentially\nbinds to 2R alpha-tocopherol and helps facilitate its incorporation\ninto VLDL. 2R means any form of alpha-tocopherol in which the 2\nposition is in the R conformation. The following table summarizes\nthe forms of alpha-tocopherol that bind well to alpha-TTP, and\nthose that don\u2019t bind well to alpha-TTP.\nTable 9.221 Alpha-tocopherol isomers and binding to alpha-TTP\nDo not bind well to alpha-TTP Bind well to alpha-TTP\nSRR RRR\nSSR RRS\nSSS RSS\nSRS RSR\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 403 Other forms of vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols) also\ndon\u2019t bind well to alpha-TTP and thus, are found in lower levels than\nalpha-tocopherol in the body. The following graph shows plasma\nvitamin E levels from a study in which subjects were given 150\nmg each of RRR-alpha-tocopherol, all-rac-alpha-tocopherol, or\ngamma-tocopherol1.\nFigure 9.222 Plasma vitamin E concentrations in response to a 150 mg dose of\nRRR-alpha-tocopherol, all-rac-alpha-tocopherol, or gamma-tocopherol.\nAdapted from reference 1\nAs you can see in the figure, there was a greater rise in the plasma\nalpha-tocopherol levels after receiving RRR-alpha-tocopherol vs.\nall-rac-alpha-tocopherol. This is not a surprise because\napproximately 50% of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol is 2R alpha-\ntocopherol that binds well with alpha-TTP. You can also see that the\nplasma gamma-tocopherol concentration is much lower than either\nnatural or synthetic alpha-tocopherol.\nFrom VLDL and subsequent lipoproteins, vitamin E reaches\ntissues, with most vitamin E in the body being found in the adipose\ntissue. There are 2 main routes of vitamin E excretion. The major\nroute of excretion is through bile that is then excreted in feces. The\n404 | Human Nutrition second route is in the urine after vitamin E is chain-shortened in a\nprocess similar to beta-oxidation to make them more water-soluble.\nReference\n1. Traber MG, Elsner A, Brigelius-Floh R. (1998) Synthetic as\ncompared with natural vitamin E is preferentially excreted as\nalpha-CEHC in human urine: Studies using deuterated alpha-\ntocopheryl acetates. FEBS Lett 437(1-2): 145-148.\n9.23 Dietary Vitamin E & Amounts Found in\nBody\nThe best food sources of vitamin E are primarily oils and nuts.\nAs you can see below, the forms of vitamin E that nuts and oils\ncontain varies, with the two major forms being alpha and gamma-\ntocopherol. Soybean, corn, and flaxseed oils are good sources of\ngamma-tocopherol. Palm and canola oils contain almost equal\namounts of alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol. Safflower oil,\nalmonds, sunflower oil, and wheat germ oil are good sources of\nalpha-tocopherol. Beta-tocopherol and delta-tocopherol are found\nin lower levels in foods. Tocotrienols, for the most part, are not\nfound in high levels in the diet. The amount of tocopherols in\ndifferent nuts and oils are shown in the figure below.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 405 Figure 9.231 Tocopherol distribution in plant products1\nThree-fourths of the oil Americans consume is soybean oil. As a\nresult, it is estimated that we consume 2-4 times more gamma-\ntocopherol than alpha-tocopherol. Europeans consume more olive,\nsunflower, and canola oil and thus are believed to consume at least\n2 times more alpha-tocopherol than gamma-tocopherol1.\nDespite Americans\u2019 higher intake of gamma tocopherol compared\nto other countries, our serum concentrations do not differ much as\nillustrated in the table below.\nTable 9.231 International serum gamma-tocopherol and alpha-\ntocopherol concentrations (uM/L)1\n406 | Human Nutrition Location Gamma-tocopherol Alpha-tocopherol\nUSA 1* 2-7 15-20\nUSA 2 5.4 22.3\nUSA 3 2.5 21.8\nCosta Rica 2.7 28.6-31.8\nFrance 1.05-1.28 26.7\nIreland 1.74-1.87 26.3\nThe Netherlands 2.3 23.9-25.5\nSpain 0.88-1.14 27.4-28.3\nItaly 1.29 24.3\nSweden 3.2 23.8\nLithuania 1.64 21.7\nAustria 1.48 21.1\nThere are 3 different studies that have reported serum levels in the\nUnited States.\nTissue concentrations, for the most part, also indicate a greater\naccumulation of alpha-tocopherol than gamma-tocopherol as\nshown in the table below.\nTable 9.232 Tissue gamma-tocopherol and alpha-tocopherol\nconcentrations (nM/g)1\nTissue Gamma-tocopherol Alpha-tocopherol\nSkin 180 127\nAdipose 176 440\nMuscle 107 155\nReference\n1.

Depletion studies require\nyears on a vitamin E-deficient diet to cause deficiency1. Deficiency\nprimarily occurs in people with lipid malabsorption problems or\nAtaxia with Isolated Vitamin E Deficiency (AVED). Individuals with\nAVED have a mutation in their alpha-TTP that prevents it from\nfunctioning correctly. The primary symptoms of vitamin E\ndeficiency are neurological problems.\nHigh levels of vitamin E intake do not result in a noted toxicity.\nHowever, higher levels of intake of alpha-tocopherol (like achieved\nby taking supplements) are associated with decreased blood\ncoagulation. In particular, hemorrhagic stroke has been linked to\nhigh alpha-tocopherol intake levels. The link below shows that in\nthis condition a blood vessel ruptures or leaks in the brain.\nWeb Link\nHemorrhagic Stroke (inactive link as of\n05/18/2021)\nIt is believed that this increased bleeding risk is due to a alpha-\ntocopherol metabolite that has anti-vitamin K activity. This\npotential antagonism will be described more in the vitamin K\nsection.\nReferences & Links\n1. DRI (2000) Dietary reference intakes for vitamin C, vitamin E,\nselenium, and carotenoids.\nLink\nHemorrhagic Stroke \u2013 http://heart.arizona.edu/heart-health/\npreventing-stroke/lowering-risks-stroke\n408 | Human Nutrition 9.25 Vitamin E DRI & IUs\nBefore 2001, all forms of vitamin E contributed to the RDA, using\na measure called alpha-tocopherol equivalents. In 2001, the Dietary\nReference Intake (DRI) committee decided only 2R forms of alpha-\ntocopherol should be used to estimate the requirement, because\nthese forms bind to alpha-TTP. Thus, other forms of vitamin E\n(gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols etc.) do not count toward the\nrequirement and the unit is now mg of alpha-tocopherol. As a result,\nsoybean, corn, and flaxseed oils, which are good sources of gamma-\ntocopherol, are no longer considered to be good sources of vitamin\nE. The figure below is a reminder of the tocopherol content of\ndifferent nuts and oils.\nFigure 9.251 Only the yellow bars count toward the 2001 DRI requirement1\nAnother level of complexity is added by the introduction of\ninternational units (IU). IUs are a unit that are used to describe the\nbioactivity of different compounds, including 4 vitamins: A, D, E, and\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 409 C. It would be less confusing if these units were not used. However,\nmost supplements use IUs. IUs are not as common on food items.\nFor vitamin E, IUs are specific for alpha-tocopherol and adjusted\nfor the molecular weight of the different forms (alpha-tocopherol\nacetate etc.). The conversion factors for converting IU to mg of\nalpha-tocopherol are:\n0.67 for RRR-alpha-tocopherol (and its esters)\n0.45 for all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (and its esters)\nHere are some example calculations showing how to use these\nconversion factors:\nExample 1. For a supplement containing 100 IU of RRR-alpha\ntocopherol:\n100 IU X 0.67 = 67 mg alpha-tocopherol\nExample 2. For a supplement containing 100 IU of all-rac-alpha\ntocopherol:\n100 IU X 0.45 = 45 mg alpha-tocopherol2,3\nReferences & Links\n1. Wagner KH, Kamal-Eldin A, Elmadfa I.

Other mammals that don\u2019t\nsynthesize vitamin C include primates, guinea pigs, and other less\nprevalent species1.\n410 | Human Nutrition Vitamin C\u2019s scientific names are ascorbic acid or ascorbate and\nthe oxidized form is dehydroascorbic acid or dehydroascorbate. The\nstructure of vitamin C is shown below.\nFigure 9.31 Structure of ascorbic acid2\nWhen ascorbic acid is oxidized, it forms semidehydroascorbate (1\ndegree of oxidation) and then dehydroascorbate (2 degrees of\noxidation). The structure of dehydroascorbic acid is shown below.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 411 Figure 9.32 Structure of dehydroascorbic acid3\nThe figure below shows the reaction through which ascorbic acid\ncan stabilize or quench 2 free radicals. The 2 circled hydrogens are\nlost and replaced by double bonds when ascorbic acid is oxidized\nto dehydroascorbic acid. Reducing dehydroascorbic acid back to\nascorbic acid is the opposite reaction.\n412 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.33 The oxidation-reduction reaction between ascorbic acid (left) and\ndehydroascorbic acid (right)2,3\nAscorbic acid is believed to be a part of an antioxidant network\n(shown below) where it is oxidized to reduce alpha-tocopherol\nradicals. Dehydroascorbic acid can be reduced by thioredoxin\nreductase, a selenoenzyme, to regenerate ascorbic acid.\nFigure 9.34 The theorized antioxidant network4\nSubsections:\n9.31 Absorption and Tissue Accumulation of Vitamin C\n9.32 Enzymatic Functions\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 413 9.33 Vitamin C Deficiency \u2013 Scurvy\n9.34 Vitamin C Toxicity, Linus Pauling, & the Common Cold\nReferences & Links\n1.

The bioavailability of\nvitamin C is high at lower doses as shown below, but drops to less\nthan 50% at higher doses.\nTable 9.311 Bioavailability of vitamin C1\nDose (mg) % Bioavailability\n200 112\n500 73\n1250 49\nAscorbic acid is actively absorbed by the sodium vitamin C\ncotransporter (SVCT) 1. This active transport is driven by the sodium\nelectrochemical gradient created by sodium-potassium ATPase.\nAscorbic acid then diffuses into the capillary and ultimately enters\ngeneral circulation. Vitamin C generally circulates as ascorbic acid.\n414 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.311 Ascorbic acid (Asc) absorption\nAccumulation\nMost water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body. Vitamin\nC is not stored, but is accumulated in certain tissues in the body\nwhere it can be 5-100 times higher than found in the plasma2.\nThe table below shows the concentrations of vitamin C in different\ntissues and fluids.\nTable 9.312 Human tissue & fluid ascorbic acid concentrations1\nOrgan/ Vitamin C Vitamin C\nOrgan/Tissue\nTissue Concentration* Concentration*\nPituitary\n40-50 Lungs 7\nGland\nAdrenal Skeletal\n30-40 3-4\nGland Muscle\nEye Lens 25-31 Testes 3\nLiver 10-16 Thyroid 2\nCerebrospinal\nBrain 13-15 3.8\nFluid\nPancreas 10-15 Plasma 0.4-1\nSpleen 10-15 Saliva 0.1-9.1\nKidneys 5-15\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 415 * mg/100 g wet tissue, mg/100 mL fluids\nHow does the body accumulate such high levels of vitamin C?\nThere are 2 primary mechanisms:\n1. Ascorbic Acid (Ascorbate) uptake using sodium-dependent\nvitamin C transporter (SVCT) 1 or 2\n2. Ascorbic Acid (Ascorbate) Recycling\nAscorbic Acid (Ascorbate) transport using sodium-dependent\nvitamin C transporter (SVCT) 1 or 2\nAs shown below, SVCT 1 and SVCT 2 transport ascorbic acid\nor ascorbate into the cell against the concentration gradient\n(represented by the orange wedge in the figure below). Like\nabsorption, this uptake is driven by the action of sodium-potassium\nATPase. This mechanism is saturable, meaning that at high\nconcentrations it reaches a threshold where it cannot take up\nascorbic acid any faster. Thus, there is a limit to how much can be\ntaken up through this mechanism3.\nFigure 9.312 Ascorbic acid (Asc) uptake using SVCT 1 and 2 against the\nascorbic acid concentration gradient3\n416 | Human Nutrition Ascorbic Acid (Ascorbate) Recycling\nIn ascorbic acid recycling, ascorbic acid is oxidized to\ndehydroascorbic acid (DHA). DHA is then transported into the cell\nmoving with its concentration gradient using GLUT1 or 3. Once\ninside the cell, DHA is reduced back to ascorbic acid, thus\nmaintaining the DHA gradient. As a result, the cell is able to\naccumulate high levels of ascorbic acid3. The figure below depicts\nascorbic acid recycling.\nFigure 9.313 Ascorbic acid recycling3\nReferences & Links\n1.

J Nutr 137(10): 2171-2184.\n9.32 Enzymatic Functions\nIn addition to its antioxidant function, vitamin C is also a cofactor\nfor a number of enzymes. The enzymes proline hydroxylase and\nlysyl hydroxylase are important in the formation of the protein\ncollagen. Hydroxylase means that the enzymes add alcohol\n(hydroxyl, -OH) to the amino acids proline and lysine, as shown\nbelow.\nFigure 9.321 Prolyl hydroxylase adds an alcohol group (circled) to proline\nforming hydroxyproline1,2\nFigure 9.322 Lysyl hydroxylase adds an alcohol group (circled) to lysine\nforming hydroxylysine3,4\nAs shown below, prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases require ferrous iron\n418 | Human Nutrition (Fe2+) to function. But in the course of the hydroxylating proline or\nlysine, ferrous iron (Fe2+) is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe3+). Ascorbic\nacid is required to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+, forming\nsemidehydroascorbic acid in the process. With Fe2+, the enzyme is\nthen able to continue to hydroxylate proline and lysine.\nFigure 9.323 Ascorbic acid reduces iron so that it can continue to serve as a\ncofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases\nWhy should you care about collagen formation? Because collagen\nis estimated to account for 30% or more of total body proteins5.\nCollagen contains a number of hydroxylated prolines and lysines\nthat are needed for collagen strands to properly cross-link. This\ncross-linking is important for collagen to wind together like a rope,\nforming the strong triple helix known as tropocollagen. This process\nis shown in the following animation, as well as in the figure below.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 419 Figure 9.324 Production of cross-linked tropocollagen in the presence of\nadequate vitamin C\nBut if there isn\u2019t enough ascorbic acid available, the collagen strands\nare underhydroxylated and instead of forming strong tropocollagen,\nthe underhydroxylated collagen is degraded as shown below.\nFigure 9.325 Production of underhydroxylated collagen\n420 | Human Nutrition This weak collagen then results in the symptoms seen in the vitamin\nC deficiency, scurvy, that will be discussed in the next subsection.\nAscorbic Acid is also needed for:\nCarnitine synthesis\nTyrosine synthesis and catabolism\nSerotonin (neurotransmitter) synthesis\nOther hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis6\nThe figure below shows how ascorbic acid is needed for dopamine\nhydroxylase, which ultimately produces the hormone epinephrine.\nFigure 9.326 Dopamine beta-hydroxylase requires\nascorbic acid to produce norepinephrine7\nReferences & Links\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline#/media/File:Prolin_-\n_Proline.svg\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 421 2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Hydroxyproline_structure.svg\n3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine#/media/File:L-lysine-\nmonocation-2D-skeletal.png\n4. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hydroxylysine.png\n5.

Because\nthey explain the symptoms of vitamin C deficiency. While it is rare\nin the United States, vitamin C deficiency, known as scurvy, displays\nsymptoms that are a result of weak collagen, that in turn, weakens\nconnective tissue throughout the body. Symptoms of scurvy include\nbleeding gums, pinpoint hemorrhages, and corkscrew hairs as\nshown in the figure and link below.\n422 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.331 Bleeding gums that occur in scurvy1\nWeb Link\nCorkscrew Hairs\nAdditional symptoms include impaired wound and fracture healing,\neasy bruising, and loose or decaying teeth. Scurvy can be fatal if not\ntreated. Scurvy was the first discovered nutrition deficiency in 1746\nby James Lind, who is shown below.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 423 Figure 9.332 Dr. James Lind discovered that scurvy was caused by a\nnutrition deficiency3\nKeep in mind as you read the description below that suggesting\nscurvy was due to a diet deficiency, at that time, sounded like flu\nwas caused by not consuming green beans. Sounds pretty crazy,\nright?\nLind was a surgeon on a British navy ship. Frequently during\nvoyages the sailors would develop scurvy for reasons that weren\u2019t\n424 | Human Nutrition understood at the time. It was known that citrus fruits could cure or\nprevent scurvy, but it was believed this was due to their acidity. Lind\nperformed clinical trials comparing citrus juice to dilute sulfuric\nacid and vinegar and found that only citrus juice caused the sailors\nto recover, as depicted in the link below. As a result of the discovery,\nthe British sailors became known as \u201cLimeys\u201d because they would\ndrink lime juice to prevent the development of the disease4.\nWeb Link\nCuring Scurvy\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scorbutic_gums.jpg\n2.

In\naddition, high intake of vitamin C increases excretion of uric acid\n(urate) and oxalic acid (oxalate). The structure of these 2 compounds\nare shown below.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 425 Figure 9.341 Structure of uric acid1\nFigure 9.342 Structure of calcium oxalate2\nThese compounds are the primary components of 2 types of kidney\n426 | Human Nutrition stones3. The figures below show the most common sites of pain in\nsomeone with kidney stones.\nFigure 9.343 Kidney stones normally\ncause pain in the shaded areas4\nThe following video describes what kidney stones are and the\nsymptoms that can occur if someone has kidney stones. The second\nlink shows some pictures of kidney stones.\nWeb Links\nVideo: Kidney Stones (1:16)\nKidney Stones\nCalcium oxalate is one of the primary forms of kidney stones with\nuric acid stones being more rare3. However, a link between\nexcretion of these compounds and actual stone formation hasn\u2019t\nbeen established. Nevertheless, high-dose vitamin C\nsupplementation should be approached with some caution, since it\nis not clear whether it increases the risk of forming kidney stones5.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 427 Linus Pauling and the common cold\nThe person who popularized taking megadoses of vitamin C was\nDr. Linus Pauling. Dr. Pauling was a chemist, and is the only person\nto receive 2 unshared Nobel Prizes. The Nobel Prize is a prestigious\naward, and Dr. Pauling was close to solving the structure of DNA.\nThis would have likely netted him another Nobel prize, but Watson\nand Crick beat him to it.\n428 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.344 Linus Pauling6\nLater in his life Pauling became convinced that megadoses of\nvitamin C could prevent the common cold. In 1970 his book Vitamin\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 429 C and the Common Cold was released and became a bestseller.\nLater he came to believe that vitamin C could prevent\ncardiovascular disease, cancer, and combat aging7. However, critics\nof his beliefs countered that all megadose supplementation was\ndoing was creating \u201cexpensive urine\u201d. This refers to the fact that\nthe RDA is only 75-90 mg/day for adults and Pauling recommended\ntaking 1-2 grams of vitamin C daily8. Thus, with vitamin C being\nwater-soluble, most of the vitamin C that people on the regimen\nwere paying to consume was being excreted in the urine, thus\nmaking it \u201cexpensive\u201d.\nA recent review of vitamin C and colds found that that routine\nmegadoses of vitamin C do not reduce the risk of the common cold\nin most individuals. However, there is some evidence that it might\nbenefit people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise\n(marathon runners) or cold environments (skiers and soldiers in\nsubarctic conditions). There has been little research conducted in\nchildren, so it is not known whether vitamin C supplementation is\nbeneficial in this age group9.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Harns%C3%A4ure_Ketoform.svg\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Calcium_oxalate.png\n3. https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-\ndiseases/kidney-stones\n4. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pos-renal.png\n5.

The primary inorganic forms of selenium are selenite (SeO3)\nand selenate (SeO4). Selenite and selenate are not commonly found\nalone in nature; they are usually complexed with sodium to form\nsodium selenite (Na2SeO3) and sodium selenate (Na2SeO4)1.\nSelenomethionine is the most common organic form of selenium.\nThe structure of selenomethionine is shown above the structure of\nthe amino acid methionine in the figure below.\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 431 Figure 9.41 Structures of organic forms of selenium and similar\nsulfur-containing amino acids\nIn comparing the structures of selenomethionine or methionine,\nyou can see that the only difference is that selenium has been\nsubstituted for the sulfur (S) atom in methionine. Selenocysteine is\nconsidered the 21st amino acid by some, because there is a codon\nthat directs its insertion into selenoproteins. Like selenomethionine\nversus methionine, the only difference between selenocysteine and\ncysteine is the substitution of selenium for sulfur. The last organic\nform is methylselenocysteine (aka Se-methylselenocysteine). Notice\nthat its structure is like selenocysteine, but with a methyl group\nadded (like the name suggests).\nThe selenium content of plants is dependent on the soil where\nthey are grown. As shown below, soil selenium levels vary greatly\nthroughout the United States, meaning that the selenium content of\nplant foods also greatly vary.\n432 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.42 United States soil selenium levels2\nThe above map is interactive, so to see the soil selenium levels in a\ncertain county or state, click on it in the link below.\nWeb Link\nUSGS Soil Selenium Levels\nInorganic forms of selenium are commonly used in supplements.\nSelenomethionine is the most common organic form of selenium in\nsupplements and food. It is found in cereal grains such as wheat,\ncorn, and rice as well as soy. Yeast are typically used to produce\nselenomethionine for supplements.\nIt should be noted that selenomethionine accumulates at much\nhigher levels in the body than other forms of selenium. This is\nbecause it can be nonspecifically incorporated into body proteins\nin place of methionine. However, despite accumulating at higher\nlevels, selenomethionine is less effective than the\nmethylselenocysteine in decreasing cancer incidence or growth in\nanimal models3. However, methylselenocysteine is not commonly\nconsumed, because it is a form that plants accumulate to prevent\nselenium from becoming toxic to themselves. Thus, plants need to\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 433 be grown in the presence of high selenium levels to accumulate\nmeaningful amounts of methylselenocysteine.\nSubsections:\n9.41 Selenoprotein\n9.42 Selenium Absorption, Excretion, Toxicity & Its Questionable\nDeficiency\nReferences & Links\n1.

This is illustrated\nin the figure below, where the different colored circles represent\namino acids in the crescent shaped enzyme. In most enzymes, the\nmineral is a cofactor that is external to the enzyme, as shown on\nthe left. Selenoenzymes contain selenocysteine as an amino acid\nin the active site of the enzyme. Thus, in selenoenzymes, selenium\ndoes not serve as a cofactor, which is different than most minerals\nrequired for enzyme function.\n434 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.411 Enzyme with a mineral cofactor versus a selenoenzyme\n25 human selenoproteins, containing the amino acid\nselenocysteine, have been identified.

Thus, selenium levels in the body are\nnot regulated by absorption, but rather by urinary excretion.\nOrganic selenium forms may be absorbed slightly better than\ninorganic forms, as one study found that 98% of a dose of\nselenomethionine was absorbed, compared to 84% of selenite1.\nSelenium is primarily excreted in the urine, but at high levels it\ncan be expired, producing garlic odor breath.\nSelenium toxicity can be a problem, especially for animals living in\nor around a body of water in an area with high soil selenium levels.\nThis is because runoff from the soil causes selenium to collect in\nthe water in high levels and then starts working its way up the food\nchain and causing problems, as shown in the following link.\nWeb Link\nSelenium Toxicity\n438 | Human Nutrition In humans, the initial symptoms are nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea. If\ncontinued, the person may\ndevelop hair and nail brittleness, rash or skin lesions, and nervous\nsystem abnormalities.\nThe questionable selenium deficiency is Keshan disease. This\ndisease occurred primarily in the mountainous regions of China,\ncausing heart lesions. Below is a topographical map of China to give\nyou an idea of what areas are mountainous.\nFigure 9.421 Topographical map of China2\nYou can see in the link below the areas where Keshan disease\noccurred. For the most part, you can see that these 2 areas overlay.\nWeb Links\nDistribution of Keshan Disease\nHowever, sodium selenate supplementation failed to totally\nAntioxidant Micronutrients | 439 eradicate Keshan disease like you would expect if it was caused\nby selenium deficiency. The incidence of Keshan disease also\nfluctuated seasonally and annually, which is unusual for a deficiency\nand more consistent of an infectious disease. Research found\ncoxsackievirus in the heart of Keshan disease victims. They isolated\nthis virus and used it to perform the experiment illustrated below.\nFigure 9.422 Keshan disease experiment3\nOne group of mice was fed an adequate selenium diet and another\ngroup a deficient selenium diet. They were then infected with\ncoxsackievirus that was mostly avirulent, but also contained some\nvirulent viruses. A virulent virus is one that causes a disease, and\nan avirulent virus is one that doesn\u2019t cause a disease (some vaccines\nuse avirulent viruses). After a period of time, they found that the\nselenium deficient animals developed severe heart pathology, while\nthe selenium adequate animals did not develop heart pathology.\nThey then isolated the virus from the hearts of the mice from both\ngroups and found that the coxsackievirus from the deficient animals\nhearts had become mostly virulent3. They then took it one step\nfurther as shown in the figure below.\n440 | Human Nutrition Figure 9.423 Keshan disease experiment continued3\nThey took the isolated virus from the selenium-deficient mouse\nhearts and infected selenium adequate animals with it. The\nselenium adequate animals developed the severe heart pathology\nlike the selenium-deficient animals had previously.\nWhat\u2019s going on? They found mutations in the virus from the\nselenium-deficient animals that they believe caused it to become\nvirulent. They believe that high oxidative stress in these animals\nleads to mutations in the virus, causing it to become virulent.\nWho cares? Research has found similar results with vitamin E.\nResearchers are also examining the effects on other viruses such as\ninfluenza (flu) and HIV. If they find a similar phenomenon occurring\nin other viruses, it means that you and your friend who eats a\nhorrible diet (eats no fruit and vegetables) could be exposed to\na virus. You don\u2019t know you were exposed because your immune\nsystem fights off the virus. However, your friend gets sick. He/\nshe can serve as a host in which the virus mutates making it more\nvirulent, which when you\u2019re exposed a second time, may make you\nsick.\nReferences & Links\n1. Stipanuk MH.

Not only is it the only non-\nB vitamin in this chapter, but there is also a connection between\nselenium (last antioxidant in the previous chapter) and iodine.\nIodine\u2019s only, yet critical, function is that it is required for thyroid\nhormone synthesis. The figure below shows that the thyroid gland is\na butterfly-shaped organ found in the neck. The parathyroid glands\nare also found within the thyroid gland.\nFigure 10.11 Location of thyroid and parathyroid glands1\nIodine is found in foods primarily as iodide (I-), some bread dough\nhas iodate (IO3-) added to help with gluten cross-linking2. This\nused to be more commonly used in the past than it is now. Like\nselenium, iodide concentrations of the soil vary greatly, causing\nfood concentrations to greatly fluctuate. Sea water is high in iodine,\nthus foods of marine origin, such as seaweed and seafood, are good\ndietary sources of iodine. Dairy products also tend to be good\nsources of iodide because it is added to cattle feeds. Cattle receive\n444 | Human Nutrition iodine-containing medications, and iodide-containing sanitizing\nsolutions are used in dairy facilities3,4.\nFor most Americans, we consume ample iodine through the\nconsumption of iodized salt. Consumption of 1/2 teaspoon of\niodized salt meets the RDA for iodine. There is a global logo for\niodized salt. However, I must admit that I don\u2019t recall ever seeing it\nmyself.\nThe other link below is to a page that contains a scorecard map\nthat depicts access to iodized salt worldwide. It also contains a\nYoutube video that displays the reduction in iodine deficiency over\nthe last 2 decades.\nWeb Link\nGlobal Iodized Salt Icon\nGlobal Iodine Scorecard\nSalt is iodized with either potassium iodide (KI) or potassium iodate\n(KIO3). The positives of each are:\nPotassium iodide\n+ Less expensive\n+ Higher iodine content (76% vs. 59% for KIO3)\n+ More soluble\nPotassium Iodate\n+ More stable\nThe U.S. uses potassium iodide, but the form, and amount, used\nvaries from country-to-country. Most Americans\u2019 salt intake comes\nfrom processed foods, many of which are made with non-iodized\nsalt. Iodine is well absorbed (~90%). Some dietary compounds\ninterfere with thyroid hormone production or utilization. These\ncompounds are known as goitrogens5. However, it is not believed\nthat goitrogens are of clinical importance unless there is a\ncoexisting iodine deficiency5.\nSome examples of foods that contain goitrogens are3,4,6:\nCassava\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 445 Figure 10.12 Cassava plants are typically grown in tropical\nand subtropical environments6\n446 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.13 The cassava roots are what are typically eaten, but first they must\nbe peeled.

A couple of pictures of goiter are shown below.\nFigure 10.121 Pictures of women with goiters1,2\nA more serious consequence of iodine deficiency occurs during\npregnancy to the fetus.

The -e has since been dropped in its\nspelling. Thiamin is sensitive to heat, so prolonged heating causes\nthe cleavage of thiamin between the 2 rings destroying its activity2.\nLike most of the B vitamins, thiamin\u2019s primary function is as a\ncofactor for enzymes. It is not thiamin alone that serves as a\ncofactor but instead thiamin diphosphate (thiamin + 2 phosphates),\nwhich is more commonly referred to as thiamin pyrophosphate\n(TPP). The structure of thiamin pyrophosphate is shown below.\nFigure 10.32 Structure of thiamin pyrophosphate (aka thiamin diphosphate)3\nIn plants, thiamin is found in its free form, but in animals it is mostly\nthiamin pyrophosphate. These phosphates must be cleaved before\nthiamin is taken up into the enterocyte4.\nThiamin uptake and absorption is believed to be an efficient\nprocess that is passive when thiamin intake is high and active when\nthiamin intakes are low4. There are two thiamin transporters\n(THTR), THTR1 and THTR2, that are involved in thiamin uptake and\nabsorption. THTR1 is found on the brush border and basolateral\nmembrane, while THTR2 is only found on the brush border\nmembrane as shown below5.\n458 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.33 Thiamin uptake and absorption\nLike most water-soluble vitamins there is little storage of thiamin.\nSubsections:\n10.31 Thiamin Functions\n10.32 Thiamin Deficiency & Toxicity\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thiamin.svg\n2.

Membrane and nerve conduction (Not as a cofactor)\nDecarboxylation Reactions\nA decarboxylation reaction is one that results in the loss of\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) from the molecule as shown below.\nFigure 10.311 Decarboxylation reaction2\nThe transition reaction and one reaction in the citric acid cycle are\ndecarboxylation reactions that use TPP as a cofactor. The figure\nbelow shows the transition reaction and citric acid cycle.\n460 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.312 The transition reaction and citric acid cycle3\nAs shown below the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA in the\ntransition reaction is a decarboxylation reaction that requires TPP\nas a cofactor. CO2 (circled) is produced as a result of this reaction.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 461 Figure 10.313 The transition reaction requires TPP as a cofactor3\nA similar TPP decarboxylation reaction occurs in the citric acid\ncycle converting alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. CO2 (circled)\nis given off as a result of this reaction.\nFigure 10.314 Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase requires TPP as a cofactor3\n462 | Human Nutrition TPP also functions as a cofactor for the decarboxylation of valine,\nleucine, and isoleucine (branched-chain amino acids)1.\nSynthesis of Pentoses and NADPH\nTPP is a cofactor for the enzyme transketolase. Transketolase is a\nkey enzyme in the pentose phosphate (aka hexose monophosphate\nshunt) pathway. This pathway is important for converting 6-carbon\nsugars into 5-carbon sugars (pentose) that are needed for synthesis\nof DNA, RNA, and NADPH. In addition, pentoses such as fructose\nare converted to forms that can be used for glycolysis and\ngluconeogenesis4. Transketolase catalyzes multiple reactions in the\npathway as shown below.\nFigure 10.315 Transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway uses TPP as a\ncofactor5\nMembrane and Nerve Conduction\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 463 In addition to its cofactor roles, thiamin, in the form of thiamin\ntriphosphate (TTP, 3 phosphates), is believed to contribute in some\nunresolved way to nervous system function1.\nReferences & Links\n1.

Some people also have a mutation in THTR1 that\ncauses them to become thiamin deficient1. Thiamin deficiency is\nknown as beriberi, which, when translated, means \u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe symptoms of beriberi are illustrated in the link below.\nWeb Link\nBeriberi\nThere are two major forms of beriberi: dry and wet. Dry beriberi\naffects the nervous system, with symptoms such as loss of muscle\nfunction, numbness, and/or tingling.

Below\nare some of the functions of FAD and FMN1:\n1. Citric Acid Cycle\n2. Electron Transport Chain\n3. Fatty Acid Oxidation\n4. Niacin Synthesis\n5. Vitamin B6 Activation\n6. Neurotransmitter Catabolism\n7. Antioxidant Enzymes\n1. Citric Acid Cycle \u2013 FAD is reduced to FADH2 in the citric acid\ncycle when succinate is converted to fumarate by succinic\ndehydrogenase as circled below.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 473 Figure 10.411 The citric acid cycle requires FAD2\n2. Electron Transport Chain \u2013 Under aerobic conditions, the\nelectron transport chain is where the FADH2 is used to\nproduce ATP. Complex I of the electron transport chain\nincludes an FMN molecule. The electron transport chain is\nshown below.\n474 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.412 Complex I in the electron transport chain contains FMN3\n3. Fatty Acid oxidation \u2013 During fatty acid oxidation FAD is\nconverted to FADH2 as shown below.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 475 Figure 10.413 Fatty acid oxidation requires FAD\n4. Niacin synthesis \u2013 As you will hear more about in the niacin\nsection, niacin can be synthesized from tryptophan as shown\nbelow. An intermediate in this synthesis is kynurenine, and one\nof the multiple steps between kynurenine to niacin requires\nFAD.\nFigure 10.414 Niacin synthesis from tryptophan requires FAD4\n5. Vitamin B6 Activation \u2013 The enzyme that creates the active\nform of vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate) requires FMN.\n476 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.415 Vitamin B6 activation requires FMN5,6\n6. Neurotransmitter Catabolism \u2013 The enzyme monoamine\noxidase (MAO) requires FAD. This enzyme shown below is\nimportant in the catabolism of neurotransmitters such as\ndopamine and serotonin.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 477 Figure 10.416 Catabolism of dopamine involves monoamine oxidase, an\nenzyme that requires FAD7\n478 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.417 Catabolism of serotonin involves monoamine oxidase, an\nenzyme that requires FAD8\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 479 7. Antioxidant Enzymes \u2013 The antioxidant enzymes glutathione\nreductase and thioredoxin reductase both require FAD as a\ncofactor. Thioredoxin reductase is a selenoenzyme. The\nfunction of glutathione reductase is shown in the following\nlink. Glutathione reductase can reduce glutathione that can\nthen be used by the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase to\nconvert hydrogen peroxide to water.\nWeb Link\nThe Glutathione Oxidation Reduction (Redox) Cycle\nIn addition to the functions listed above, FAD is also used in folate\nactivation, choline catabolism, and purine metabolism1.\nReferences & Links\n1.

The structure of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are\nshown below.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 483 Figure 10.51 Structure of nicotinic acid1\n484 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.52 Structure of nicotinamide2\nNiacin is important for the production of two cofactors:\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). The structure of NAD is shown\nbelow; you can clearly see the nicotinamide at the top right of the\nmolecule.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 485 Figure 10.53 Structure of NAD3\nNAD is reduced to form NADH, as shown below.\n486 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.54 Reduction of NAD to NADH4\nThe structure of NADP+ is exactly the same as NAD, except it has\nan extra phosphate group off the bottom of the structure, as shown\nbelow.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 487 Figure 10.55 Structure of NADP+5\n488 | Human Nutrition Like NAD, NADP+ can be reduced to NADPH.\nNiacin is unique in that it can be synthesized from the amino\nacid tryptophan as shown below. An intermediate in this synthesis\nis kynurenine. Many reactions occur between this compound and\nniacin, and riboflavin and vitamin B6 are required for two of these\nreactions.\nFigure 10.56 Tryptophan can be used to synthesize niacin6\nTo account for niacin synthesis from tryptophan, niacin equivalents\n(NE) were created by the DRI committee to account for the amount\nof niacin in foods as well as their tryptophan content. It takes\napproximately 60 mg of tryptophan to make 1 mg of niacin. Thus,\nthe conversions to niacin equivalents are:\n1 mg Niacin = 1 NE\n60 mg Tryptophan = 1 NE\nThe tryptophan levels of most foods is not known, but a good\nestimate is that tryptophan is 1% of amino acids in protein7. Thus,\nlets take peanut butter, smooth style, with salt as an example8.\nThe peanut butter contains 13.403 mg of niacin and 25.09 g of\nprotein8.\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of tryptophan:\n25.09 g X 0.01 (the numerical value of 1%) = 0.2509g of tryptophan\nStep 2: Convert Grams to Milligrams\n0.2509 g X 1000 mg/g = 250.9 mg of tryptophan\nStep 3: Calculate NE from tryptophan\n250.9 mg of tryptophan/(60 mg of tryptophan/1 NE) = 4.182 NE\nStep 4: Add NEs together\n13.403 NE (from niacin) + 4.182 (from tryptophan) = 17.585 NE\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 489 Most niacin we consume is in the form of nicotinamide and\nnicotinic acid9, and in general is well absorbed using an unresolved\ncarrier10. However, in corn, wheat, and certain other cereal\nproducts, niacin bioavailability is low. In these foods, some niacin\n(~70% in corn) is tightly bound, making it unavailable for absorption.\nTreating the grains with a base frees the niacin and allows it to be\nabsorbed. After absorption nicotinamide is the primary circulating\nform7,9.\nSubsections:\n10.51 Niacin Functions\n10.52 Niacin Deficiency & Toxicity\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Niacinstr.png\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nicotinamide_structure.svg\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NAD%2B_phys.svg\n4. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:NAD_oxidation_reduction.svg\n5. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NADP%2B_phys.svg\n6. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Nicotinic_acid_biosynthesis2.png\n7.

This is no longer a common\ndeficiency in developed countries, but was in the U.S. in the early\n1900s. This was because corn was a staple crop, meaning it was what\npeople primarily consumed. The bioavailability of niacin from corn\nis poor unless treated with a base to release the bound niacin. The\nsymptoms of pellagra are the 3 D\u2019s:\nDementia\nDermatitis\nDiarrhea\nSome refer to 4 D\u2019s in which the 4th D is death if the condition\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 495 is not managed.

However, nicotinic acid (not\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 497 nicotinamide) can improve people\u2019s lipid profiles when consumed at\nlevels far above the RDA. For instance the RDA & upper limit (UL) is\n14 or 16 (women & men) and 35 mg (both), respectively. Many people\nare taking 1-2 grams (up to 6 g/day) to get the benefits in their\nplasma lipid profiles as shown in the table below4,5.\nTable 10.521 Effects of nicotinic acid (>1.5 g/day) on plasma lipid\nprofile3\nMeasure Change\nVLDL \u2193 25-40%\nLDL \u2193 6-22%\nHDL \u2191 18-35%\nTotal Cholesterol \u2193 21-44%\nTriglycerides \u2193 21-44%\nIt should be pointed out that there are special supplements for\nthis purpose that include a slower release nicotinic acid that helps\nprevent the toxicity symptoms (nicotinamide is not toxic).

Pyridoxine contains a methylhydroxyl group (-\nCH3OH), pyridoxal an aldehyde (-CHO), and pyridoxamine an\naminomethyl group (-CH3NH2), as shown below.\nFigure 10.71 Structure of pyridoxine1\n504 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.72 Structure of pyridoxal2\nFigure 10.73 Structure of pyridoxamine3\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 505 All three forms can be activated by being phosphorylated. The\nphosphorylated forms can be interconverted to the active, or the\ncofactor form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). This active\nform has a phosphate group added in place of a hydroxyl group.\nThe enzyme that catalyzes this reaction requires FMN (riboflavin\ncofactor), as shown below.\nFigure 10.74 Vitamin B6 activation1,4\nIn animal products, vitamin B6 is found in its cofactor forms, PLP\nand pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP). The latter cofactor is less\ncommon than PLP. In plants, vitamin B6 is primarily found as\npyridoxine, with up to 75% being pyridoxine glucoside, which is\nbelieved to be the plant storage form6. Pyridoxine glucoside has a\nglucose added to pyridoxine as shown below.\n506 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.75 Structure of pyridoxine glucoside5\nVitamin B6 is well absorbed from foods (~75%) through passive\ndiffusion. PLP and PMP are dephosphorylated before uptake into\nthe enterocyte. Some of the pyridoxamine glucoside is cleaved to\nform free pyridoxine, but some pyridoxine glucoside is absorbed\nintact. Pyridoxine glucoside absorption is lower (~50%) than\npyridoxine alone. The primary circulating forms of vitamin B6 are\npyridoxal and PLP. Vitamin B6 is primarily excreted in the urine, and\nlike many other B vitamins, vitamin B6 is destroyed during cooking\nor heating6.\nSubsections:\n10.71 Vitamin B6 Functions\n10.72 Vitamin B6 Deficiency & Toxicity\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pyridoxine_structure.svg\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 507 2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pyridoxal.png\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pyridoxamine.png\n4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nPyridoxal_phosphate#/media/File:Pyridoxal-phosphate.svg\n5. http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/\nsummary.cgi?cid=440188&loc=ec_rcs\n6.

The neurological symptoms are due to the\ndecreased production of neurotransmitters1.\nVitamin B6, unlike many of the B vitamins, can produce toxicity.\nHigh doses of vitamin B6, taken for an extended period of time,\ncan lead to neurological damage2. There are some potential uses\nof vitamin B6 supplementation that are important to be done with\nconsultation with a physician.\nOne of the conditions that people take vitamin B6 for is carpal\ntunnel syndrome. The following video does a nice job of explaining\nand showing how this condition occurs.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (1:02)\n512 | Human Nutrition While the evidence is not conclusive, it appears that vitamin B6\nsupplementation may be beneficial to those suffering from carpal\ntunnel syndrome and may be tried alone, or in combination with\nother complementary treatments, before surgery is undertaken3,4.\nMorning sickness that occurs early in pregnancy is another\ncondition where vitamin B6 supplementation is utilized. The\nevidence again is not clear on whether it is beneficial5,6, but The\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests that\nvitamin B6 may be tried first to treat nausea and vomiting during\npregnancy7. In 2013, the FDA approved doxylamine-pyridoxine\n(Diclegis) for use in pregnancy8. It is not known exactly what causes\nmorning sickness, but it is believed that lower circulating vitamin B6\nlevels are associated with increased morning sickness severity9.\nThe last condition that vitamin B6 is commonly supplemented\nfor is premenstrual syndrome (PMS). A systematic literature review\nfound that it is inconclusive whether vitamin B6 supplementation is\nbeneficial in managing PMS10.\nReferences & Links\n1. Stipanuk MH.

As the\nname sounds, these enzymes add carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)\nto whatever compound they act on. In fatty acid synthesis, biotin is\nrequired by the enzyme that forms malonyl CoA from acetyl-CoA, as\nshown below1.\n516 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.811 The conversion of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA in fatty acid\nsynthesis requires biotin2\nAnother biotin-requiring carboxylase is one that converts pyruvate\nto oxaloacetate in gluconeogenesis as shown below1.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 517 Figure 10.812 Biotin is required for conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate in\nthe oxaloacetate workaround of gluconeogenesis (like glycolysis in reverse\nwith oxaloacetate workaround)3\nIn addition to these two functions, biotin is also important for\nhistone biotinylation and the breakdown of isoleucine, leucine,\nmethionine, and threonine1.\nHistone biotinylation is an epigenetic modification that is\ndescribed in the next section.\nBiotin is an effective treatment for brittle nail syndrome, but it has\nnot been shown to improve healthy nails4.

Epigenetics means \u201cabove the genome.\u201d The\nnucleotide sequence of the human genome is known, and there is\nsurprisingly little difference between individuals. However, the 2\nmain epigenetic modifications play a major role in determining what\ngenes are expressed:\nDNA methylation\nHistone modification\nThese epigenetic modifications are illustrated in the following\nlink.\nWeb Link\nEpigenetic modifications (inactive link as of 05/18/2021)\nDNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to a DNA base,\nwhich decreases gene transcription. Conversely, demethylation\nincreases gene transcription.\nDNA does not exist simply as long strands of double helix, instead\nit is packaged and shaped so that it can fit in the nucleus of our\ncells. The first part of this packaging is that DNA is wrapped around\nproteins called histones as shown below.\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 519 Figure 10.821 DNA is wrapped around histones1\nHistone modification occurs when there are additions or\nsubtractions to the histones themselves. The most common is\nacetylation (addition of an acetyl group) or deacetylation of\nhistones. The structure of acetyl is shown below.\n520 | Human Nutrition Figure 10.822 Structure of acetyl2\nHistone acetylation causes the DNA structure to open up so that\ntranscription can occur. Histone deacetylation causes the DNA to\nbecome more tightly packed, preventing transcription from\noccurring.\nTogether, these modifications to DNA and histones are known\nas the epigenetic code. The following two videos do a good job\nexplaining epigenetics and tying together its two different methods\nof modification:\nMacronutrient Metabolism Micronutrients | 521 Web Links\nVideo: A Tale of Two Mice (4:39)\nVideo: Histone Modifications (2:18)\nHow does this relate to biotin? Histones can be biotinylated, or\nhave biotin added to the histone. However, it should be noted that\nhistone biotinylation is rare (<0.001% of human histones H3 and H4),\nso it is questionable how much impact this action has3.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nucleosome_structure.png\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acetyl.svg\n2.

Symptoms of biotin deficiency\ninclude1:\nSkin rash\nHair loss\nNeurological Impairments\nThere are a couple of ways that a person could develop a\ndeficiency in biotin. First, a very small number of people are born\nwith a mutation in biotinidase that results in them not being able\nto cleave biocytin for absorption1. Another way is through the\nconsumption of raw eggs. Drinking raw eggs is not something that\n522 | Human Nutrition most people do. However, some people do it to imitate Sylvester\nStallone\u2019s movie character Rocky, who consumed them as part of his\nboxing training regimen. If you are not familiar with this movie the\nlink below shows you how Rocky consumed his raw eggs.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Rocky Raw Eggs (1:21)\nThe potential problem with consuming raw eggs routinely is that\nraw egg whites contain a protein called avidin which binds biotin\nand prevents its absorption. However, it would take more than two\ndozen egg whites consumed daily over many months to cause a\ndeficiency, making this an unlikely occurrence2. Cooking denatures\navidin and prevents it from binding biotin, meaning that cooked\neggs are not a concern.\nNo toxicity of biotin has been reported.\nReferences & Links\n1.

This is the movement of 1 carbon units, generally\nmethyl groups (CH3). It is similar to the movement of the amino\ngroup that occurs in transamination. As shown in the figure below,\nfolate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 are the B vitamins involved in\n1-carbon metabolism.\nFigure 11.1 One-carbon metabolism depiction. 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (THF)\ndonates a methyl group to cobalamin forming methylcobalamin.\nMethylcobalamin donates a methyl group to homocysteine, forming\nmethionine (amino acid). Alternatively, vitamin B6 can be utilized to convert\nhomocysteine into cysteine.\nVitamin B6 has been covered already in the previous chapter, so this\nchapter is going to focus on folate and vitamin B12. We will examine\nthis figure in pieces, so that hopefully by the time this chapter is\ncompleted, you will understand the role of all these vitamins in\n1-carbon metabolism.\nSections:\n11.1 Folate & Folic Acid\n11.2 Vitamin B12\n11.3 B Vitamins, Homocysteine, & Cardiovascular Disease\n524 | One-Carbon Metabolism\nMicronutrients 11.1 Folate & Folic Acid\nFolate is a B vitamin that exists in either its reduced form (folate)\nor oxidized form (folic acid). When folate is used in this section, we\nare referring to the reduced form, not the vitamin itself. Another\nkey distinction between the 2 terms is that folic acid refers to the\nsynthetic form, while folate refers to the natural form. Folic acid is\nonly found in certain foods because they have been fortified with\nit, not because they produce it. The structure of folic acid is shown\nbelow.\nFigure 11.11 Structure of Folic Acid1\nAnother key difference between folate and folic acid is the number\nof glutamates in their tails. Notice that glutamate is boxed in the\nstructure of folic acid above. Folic acid always exists as a\nmonoglutamate, meaning it only contains 1 glutamate. On the other\nhand, about 90% of the folate found in foods are polyglutamates,\nmeaning there is more than 1 glutamate in their tail. Folic acid is\nmore stable than folate, which can be destroyed by heat, oxidation,\nand light2. Table 11.11 summarizes the key differences between folate\nand folic acid.\nTable 11.11 Comparison of folate to folic acid\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 525 Folate Folic Acid\nReduced Form Oxidized Form\nNatural Synthetic\nPolyglutamate Monoglutamate\nMore Stable\nThe bioavailability of folate was believed to be much lower than folic\nacid.3 To account for these differences, the DRI committee created\ndietary folate equivalents (DFEs) to set the DRIs4. DFEs are defined\nas follows:\n1 DFE = 1 ug food folate = 0.6 ug food folic acid = 0.5 ug folic acid\non an empty stomach\nDFE = ug food folate + (ug folic acid X 1.7)\nThe 1.7 came from research suggesting that folic acid from food\nwas 85% bioavailable, compared to 50% for folate (85%/50% = 1.7)4.\nThis was established in 1998 by the DRI committee, and it is likely\nthat these conversions & the requirements will change based on\nthe newer evidence suggesting folate\u2019s bioavailability from food is\nhigher (80% of folic acid) than previously believed3. With this data,\nthe new conversion factor for folic acid would be 1.25 (100%/80%).\nThis conversion factor means that food folate levels are probably\ncontributing more towards our dietary needs than currently being\nestimated by the DFE, but the DRI for folate/folic acid has not been\nupdated.\nBefore folate (polyglutamates) can be taken up into the\nenterocyte, the extra glutamates must be cleaved prior to uptake\ninto the enterocyte by the reduced folate transporter (RFT, aka\nreduced folate carrier)5-7. Folic acid, because it is a monoglutamate,\nrequires no cleavage for uptake before it is taken up through the\nRFT. Once inside the enterocyte, the monoglutamate form is\nmethylated and transported into circulation through an unresolved\ncarrier5. This series of events is depicted in the figure below.\n526 | Human Nutrition Figure 11.12 The uptake and absorption of folate and folic acid (orange boxes\nrepresent glutamate)\nThus, the methylated monoglutamate form is the circulating form.\nThis is transported to the liver where it is converted back to the\npolyglutamate form for storage. Folate is excreted in both the urine\nand feces5.\nSubsections:\n11.11 Folate Functions\n11.12 Folate Deficiency & Toxicity\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Folat.svg\n2.

As described earlier, this is the transfer of 1-carbon\nunits from 1 compound to another. The cofactor form of folate is\ntetrahydrofolate (THF). As is shown in the figure below, in order\nfor THF to be formed, a methyl group is transferred to cobalamin\n(vitamin B12) from 5-methyl THF (THF plus a methyl group), forming\nmethyl-cobalamin. You can see this on the left side of the figure\nbelow.\nFigure 11.111 One-carbon metabolism\n528 | Human Nutrition There are 2 major cofactor functions of THF1:\n1. DNA Synthesis\nTHF is required for the synthesis of DNA bases (purines and\npyrimidines)1. As shown in the link below, N10-formyl-THF (a form\nof THF) is needed in 2 reactions (3 and 9) in purine synthesis.\nWeb Link\nPurine Synthesis\n2.

The hallmark symptom of folate deficiency is\nmegaloblastic (aka macrocytic) anemia. Megaloblastic anemia, as the\nname suggests, is characterized by large, nucleated (most red blood\ncells do not have a nucleus), immature red blood cells. This occurs\nbecause folate is needed for DNA synthesis; without it red blood\ncells are not able to divide properly1. As a result, fewer and poorer\nfunctioning red blood cells are produced that cannot carry oxygen\nas efficiently as normal red blood cells2.\nA maternal folate deficiency can lead to neural tube defects in\ninfants. The exact cause of neural tube defects is unknown, but\nfolate supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence\nof neural tube defects3. The most common of these neural tube\ndefects is spina bifida (1 out of 2500 babies born in the United\nStates), which is a failure of the neural tube to close and the spinal\ncord and its fluid protrude out the infant\u2019s back, as shown below4,5.\n530 | Human Nutrition Figure 11.121 Spina bifida6\nThe neural tube closes 21-28 days after conception1, and with 50%\nof pregnancies estimated to be unplanned, many women aren\u2019t\naware they are pregnant during this period1,2. Thus, it is\nrecommended that women of childbearing age consume 400 ug\nof folic acid daily1. In addition, in 1998 the FDA mandated that all\nrefined cereals and grains be fortified with 140 ug folic acid /100\ngrams of product7. As you can see below, spina bifida prevalence\nrates declined during the optional fortification years and declined\nfurther once fortification became mandatory in the United States.\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 531 Figure 11.122 Neural tube defect prevalence 1995-20118\nHowever, more recent research has found that folic acid\nsupplementation begun before conception reduced the occurrence\nand severity of neural tube defects9.\nThe following link is an interesting account of the history that led\nup to the folic acid fortification. It is debatable whether folic acid\nfortification was fully responsible for the decrease in spina bifida\nrates shown above, but the rates are lower than they were pre-\nfortification. The second link is to the announcement that in 2016\nthe FDA approved the fortification of corn masa flour.\nWeb Link\nFolic Acid Fortification: Fact and Folly (inactive link as of 05/18/2021)\nFDA Approves Folic Acid Fortification of Corn Masa Flour\nFolate/Folic acid is not toxic, but it can mask a vitamin B12\ndeficiency and prevent its diagnosis. This effect will be discussed\nfurther in the vitamin B12 deficiency section.\nReferences & Links\n1. Byrd-Bredbenner C, Moe G, Beshgetoor D, Berning J.

Neither\nplants nor animals can synthesize vitamin B12. Instead, vitamin B12\nin animal products is produced by microorganisms within the\nanimal that the products came from. Animals consume the\nmicroorganisms in soil or bacteria in ruminant animals that produce\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 533 vitamin B121. Some plant products, such as fermented soy products\n(tempeh, miso) and the sea algae supplement, spirulina, are\nadvertised as being good sources of B12. However, fermented soy\nproducts are not a reliable vitamin B12 source2 and spirulina\ncontains a pseudovitamin B12 compound that is not bioavailable3.\nFor vegans, supplements, nutritional yeast, and fortified products\nlike fortified soy milk can help them meet their vitamin B12 needs4.\nVitamin B12\u2019s scientific name is cobalamin, which makes sense\nwhen you consider it contains cobalt and many amine groups, as\nshown in the figure below.\n534 | Human Nutrition Figure 11.21 Structure of vitamin B12 (cobalamin)5\nThe other feature that is important in cobalamin is the circled R\ngroup. This is what differs between the different cobalamins, whose\nnames and R groups are shown in the following table.\nTable 11.21 Different cobalamin forms\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 535 R Group Name\nCN Cyanocobalamin\nOH Hydroxocobalamin\nH2O Aquocobalamin\nNO2 Nitritocobalamin\n5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl Adenosylcobalamin*\nCH3 Methylcobalamin*\n*Cofactor Forms\nThe 2 cofactor forms are adenosylcobalamin and\nmethylcobalamin. We can convert most cobalamins into these 2\ncofactor forms. Most foods contain adenosylcobalamin,\nhydroxocobalamin, or methylcobalamin6. The most common form\nfound in supplements is cyanocobalamin, with some also using\nmethylcobalamin7. Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of the\nvitamin B12.\nThe uptake, absorption, and transport of vitamin B12 is a complex\nprocess. The following descriptions explain, and figures illustrate,\nthis process.\nVitamin B12 is normally bound to protein in food. Salivary glands\nin the mouth produce haptocorrin (formerly known as R protein),\nwhich travels with the food into the stomach. In the stomach, acid\nconverts pepsinogen into pepsin, and the protein intrinsic factor is\nreleased from the parietal cells1,8.\n536 | Human Nutrition Figure 11.22 Vitamin B12 in the stomach part 18,9\nAs pepsin frees B12 from protein, haptocorrin binds to the newly\nfreed vitamin B12 (haptocorrin + B12). Intrinsic factor escapes\ndigestion and, along with haptocorrin + B12, exits the stomach and\nenters the duodenum1,8.\nFigure 11.23 Vitamin B12 in the stomach part 28,9\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 537 In the duodenum, pancreatic proteases break down haptocorrin,\nand again vitamin B12 is freed. Intrinsic factor then binds vitamin\nB12 (intrinsic factor + B12); intrinsic factor + B12 continues into the\nileum to prepare for absorption1,8.\nFigure 11.24 Vitamin B12 in the duodenum8,9\nIn the ileum, intrinsic factor + B12 is believed to be endocytosed by\ncubulin (aka intrinsic factor receptor), forming an endosome inside\nthe enterocyte. Intrinsic factor is broken down in the enterocyte,\nfreeing vitamin B12. The free vitamin B12 is then bound to\ntranscobalamin II (TC II + B12); TC II + B12 moves into circulation8.\n538 | Human Nutrition Figure 11.25 Vitamin B12 absorption8,9\nThe liver is the primary storage site for vitamin B12. Unlike most\nother water-soluble vitamins, the liver is able to maintain significant\nstores of vitamin B12. Uptake into the liver occurs through the\nbinding of TC II + B12 to the TC II Receptor and the endocytosis of\nboth the compound and the receptor8. Vitamin B12 is once again\nfreed after degradation of TC II. Vitamin B12 is primarily stored in\nthe liver as adenosylcobalamin6,8.\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 539 Figure 11.26 Hepatic uptake and storage of vitamin B129\nThe overall bioavailability of vitamin B12 is believed to be\napproximately 50%3, with the different cobalamin forms having\nsimilar bioavailabilities7. Sublingual supplements of vitamin B12 have\nbeen found to be equally efficacious as oral supplements7. Excretion\noccurs mostly through bile, with little loss in urine6.\nSubsections:\n11.21 Vitamin B12 Functions\n11.22 Vitamin B12 Deficiency & Toxicity\nReferences & Links\n1.

Methionine synthase\n2. Methylmalonyl mutase\nMethionine Synthase\nMethionine synthase is an important enzyme in 1-carbon\nmetabolism that uses methylcobalamin as its cofactor and converts\nhomocysteine to methionine by adding a methyl group. Methionine\nthen is converted to other compounds that serve as methyl donors,\nas shown below1.\nFigure 11.211 One-carbon metabolism\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 541 These methyl donors can donate methyl groups for methylating\nDNA, an epigenetic modification1.\nMethymalonyl mutase\nThis enzyme uses adenosylcobalamin as its cofactor, and is\nimportant in the breakdown of odd chain fatty acids (5 carbons etc.).\nAs you know, odd chain fatty acids are less common than even chain\nfatty acids, but this enzyme is required to properly handle these less\ncommon fatty acids1.\nDemyelination\nIn addition to its role as a cofactor for enzymes, vitamin B12 is\nalso important for preventing degradation of the myelin sheath that\nsurrounds neurons, as shown below.\nFigure 11.212 Vitamin B12 is needed to maintain the myelin sheath that\nsurrounds neurons2\nThe mechanism through which vitamin B12 prevents demyelination\nis not known3.\nReferences & Links\n1.

Thus, THF is not available for normal DNA synthesis\nand the red blood cells do not divide correctly.\nNeurological Abnormalities\nVitamin B12 deficiency also results in nerve degeneration and\nabnormalities that can often precede the development of anemia.\nThese include a decline in mental function and burning, tingling,\nand numbness of legs. These symptoms can continue to worsen and\ndeficiency can be fatal1.\nThe most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious\nanemia, a condition of inadequate intrinsic factor production that\ncauses poor vitamin B12 absorption. This condition is common in\npeople over the age of 50 because they have the condition atrophic\ngastritis2. Atrophic gastritis is a chronic inflammatory condition\nthat leads to the loss of glands in the stomach, as shown in the\nfigure in the following link.\nWeb Link\nAtrophic Gastritis\nThe loss of glands leads to decreased intrinsic factor production.\nIt is estimated that ~6% of those age 60 and over are vitamin B12\nOne-Carbon Metabolism Micronutrients | 543 deficient, with 20% having marginal status3. In addition to the\nelderly, vegans are also at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency because\nthey do not consume animal products. However, the deficiency may\ntake years to develop in adults because of stores and recycling of\nvitamin B122. Deficiency has the potential to occur much quicker in\ninfants or young children on vegan diets because they do not have\nstores that adults do4.\nFolate/Folic Acid masking vitamin B12 deficiency\nAs mentioned above, folate and vitamin B12 lead to the same\nmegaloblastic (macrocytic) anemia. If high levels of folate or folic\nacid (most of the concern is with folic acid since it is fortified in\nfoods and commonly taken in supplements) is given during vitamin\nB12 deficiency, it can correct this anemia. This is referred to as\nmasking because it does not rectify the deficiency, but it \u201ccures\u201d\nthis symptom. This is problematic because it does not correct the\nmore serious neurological problems that can result from vitamin\nB12 deficiency. There are some people who are concerned about\nthe fortification of cereals and grains with folic acid because people\nwho are B12 deficient might not develop macrocytic anemia, which\nmakes a vitamin B12 deficiency harder to diagnose2.\nNo toxicity of vitamin B12 has been reported.\nReferences & Links\n1.

The\nindividual sections are:\n12.1 Vitamin D\n12.2 Calcium\n12.3 Phosphorus\n12.4 Fluoride\n12.5 Vitamin K\n12.6 Vitamin A\n12.7 Iron\n12.8 Zinc\n12.9 Copper\n12.1 Vitamin D\nVitamin D is unique among the vitamins in that it is part vitamin,\npart hormone. It is considered part hormone for two reasons: (1)\nwe have the ability to synthesize it, and (2) it has hormone-like\nfunctions. The amount synthesized, however, is often not enough\nto meet our needs. Thus, we need to consume this vitamin under\ncertain circumstances, meaning that vitamin D is a conditionally\nessential micronutrient.\nThere are two major dietary forms of vitamin D: the form\nproduced mainly by plants and yeast is vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol),\nand the form mainly made by animals is vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).\nThe mainly terms in the previous sentence are because lichens, a\nsymbiotic relationship between 2 bacteria and a fungus, are able\nBlood, Bones & Teeth\nMicronutrients | 547 to synthesize vitamin D3, and are being utilized some now\ncommercially as described in the following article.\nWeb Link\nVeggie D3 maker explores novel production process to secure future\nfunding supplies\nThe structures of these two forms are shown below. Notice that the\nonly difference is the presence of a double bond in D2 that is not in\nD3.\nFigure 12.11 Structure of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3\n(cholecalciferol)1,2\nWe synthesize vitamin D3 from cholesterol, as shown below. In\nthe skin, cholesterol is converted to 7-dehydrocholesterol. In the\npresence of UV-B light, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to\nvitamin D3. Synthesized vitamin D will combine with vitamin D-\nbinding protein (DBP) to be transported to the liver. Dietary vitamin\nD2 and D3 is transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then\ntaken up in chylomicron remnants. Once in the liver, the enzyme\n25-hydroxylase (25-OHase) adds a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the 25th\ncarbon, forming 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D, calcidiol). This is\n548 | Human Nutrition the circulating form of vitamin D, thus 25(OH)D blood levels are\nmeasured to assess a person\u2019s vitamin D status. The active form of\nvitamin D is formed with the addition of another hydroxyl group\nby the enzyme 1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-OHase) in the kidney,\nforming 1,25 hydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). The synthesis and\nactivation of vitamin D is shown in the figures below.\nFigure 12.12 Vitamin D synthesis and activation4\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 549 Figure 12.13 Synthesis of 25(OH)D (calcidiol) from vitamin D3 by\n25-hydroxylase5,6\nFigure 12.14 Synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) from 25(OH)D by\n1alpha-hydroxylase6\nHowever, there are a number of other tissues that have been found\nto have 1alpha-hydroxylase activity. Therefore, these tissues can\nactivate circulating 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D for their own use.\nVitamin D2 and D3 were once thought to be equivalent forms\nof vitamin D, but research has found that D3 supplementation\nincreases 25(OH)D levels more than D2 supplementation7,8.\n550 | Human Nutrition Subsections:\n12.11 Environmental Factors That Impact Vitamin D3 Synthesis\n12.12 Dietary or Supplemental Vitamin D\n12.13 Response to Low Blood Calcium\n12.14 Response to High Blood Calcium\n12.15 Vitamin D Receptor\n12.16 Vitamin D Deficiency, Toxicity, & Insufficiency\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ergocalciferol.svg\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cholecalciferol.svg\n3.

There is an inverse relationship between\ndistance from the equator and UV light exposure. Thus, with\nincreased distance from the equator (increased latitude), there is\ndecreased UV light exposure and vitamin D3 synthesis. The link\nbelow shows the latitude and longitude lines of the United States.\nWeb Link\nUnited States Latitude and Longitude Lines\nSeasons\nSeasons also make a difference in vitamin D3 synthesis. In Boston\n(42 N), vitamin D synthesis only occurs from March-October,\n\u0966\nbecause during late fall and winter not enough UV-B reaches the\nearth\u2019s surface to synthesize vitamin D3. However, in Los Angeles\n552 | Human Nutrition (34 N), vitamin D3 synthesis occurs year round2. The difference is\n\u0966\nthe angle of the sun relative to latitude and how many UV-B photons\nare absorbed before they reach the earth\u2019s surface1.\nFigure 12.111 Seasons are also an important factor affecting vitamin D3\nsynthesis\nTime\nTime of day is also an important factor in affecting vitamin D3\nsynthesis. Vitamin D3 synthesis increases in the morning before\npeaking at noon, then declines the rest of the day1.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 553 Figure 12.112 Time of day is an important factor for vitamin D3 synthesis\nSkin pigmentation\nAnother factor that plays an important role in vitamin D3\nsynthesis is skin pigmentation. Skin color is the result of increased\nproduction of the pigment melanin, as shown in the link below.\nWeb Link\nMelanin\nVery dark skin color can provide a sun protection factor (SPF) 8-30\nfor those individuals who never burn2. These individuals will require\napproximately 5- to 10-times greater sunlight exposure than a light-\nskinned, white person to synthesize the same amount of vitamin\nD32,3.\nAge\nAge also plays a factor in vitamin D3 synthesis. Aging results\nin decreased 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations in the skin,\nresulting in an approximately 75% reduction in the vitamin D3\nsynthesis capability by age 703.\n554 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.114 Aging decreases vitamin D synthesis\nClothing\nClothing is another factor that influences vitamin D3 synthesis.\nMore clothing means that less sun reaches your skin, and thus less\nvitamin D3 synthesis.\nFigure 12.115 Which of these 2 do you think is synthesizing less vitamin D?\nSunscreen, \u201cSensible Sun Exposure\u201d, and Tanning\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 555 There is quite a spirited debate on sunscreen, sun exposure, skin\ncancer, and vitamin D synthesis. On one side are the vitamin D\nresearchers, on the other side are dermatologists. Vitamin D\nresearch found that SPF 8 sunscreen almost totally blocked vitamin\nD3 synthesis4. However, the SPF value equals 1/(# photons that\nreaches your skin) meaning that SPF 30 means 1/30 UV photons\nreach your skin. Thus, vitamin D3 synthesis shouldn\u2019t be totally\nblocked. In addition, studies indicate that consumers apply 1/2 or\nless of the amount required to get the listed SPF protection4.\nResearchers recommend sun exposure on the face, arms, and hands\nfor 10-15 minutes 2-3 times per week between 10 AM-3 PM2,5.\nHowever, dermatologists do not like \u201csensible sun exposure\u201d\nbecause this is also the peak time for harmful sun exposure.\nDermatologists say that \u201csensible sun exposure\u201d appeals to those\nwho are looking for a reasons to support tanning and are at highest\nrisk (primarily young, fair-skinned females) of sun damage. They\nargue that vitamin D can be provided through supplementation3.\nWhat about tanning beds? Not all tanning beds provide UV-B rays\nthat are needed for vitamin D3 synthesis. In fact, some advertise\nthat they only use UV-A rays that are safer, even though this is not\nthe case6. Virtually every health organization advises against using\ntanning beds, because the risks are far greater than the potential\nbenefits6,7.\nReferences & Links\n1.

Good sources of vitamin D are fatty fish (salmon, tuna,\netc.) and their oils (such as cod liver oil). The amount in fatty fish\nvaries greatly with wild-caught salmon being the highest. One study\nshowed that farmed salmon contained almost 75% less vitamin D\nthan wild-caught salmon1. It is not known whether this disparity\nexists between other types of farmed and wild-caught fish varieties.\nTable 12.121 Vitamin D content of fish1\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 557 Fish Vitamin D (IU/oz)\nBlue Fish 280 \u00b1 68\nCod 104 \u00b1 24\nGrey Sole 56 \u00b1 36\nFarmed Salmon 240 \u00b1 108\nWild Salmon 988 \u00b1 524\nFarmed Trout 388 \u00b1 212\nTuna 404 \u00b1 440\nLike vitamin C, E, and A, international units (IU) are also used for\nvitamin D.\nFor vitamin D the conversions are:\n1 ug of D3 = 40 IU\n1 ug of 25-OH-D = 200 IU2\nThus, since not many foods contain vitamin D, many brands of\nmilk have been fortified with vitamin D2 or D3 (100 IU/8 oz) since\nthe 1930s3. However, the actual measured amount of vitamin D in\nmany brands of milk is far less than stated on their labels4,5. Part\nof this problem stems from a lack of a standardized method for\nmeasuring vitamin D in the past. Without standardized analysis,\nthere inevitably was a wide range of variation from lab to lab in the\nreported amount of vitamin D.\nAnother issue with relying on dairy products to provide vitamin\nD is the common problem of lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerant\nindividuals don\u2019t have lactase, the enzyme needed to break down\nlactose. Common symptoms of this condition include:\nAbdominal Pain\nAbdominal Bloating\nGas\nDiarrhea\nNausea6\nLactose intolerance is a fairly common problem worldwide, as\nshown in the map below.\n558 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.121 Lactose intolerance worldwide (red high, green low)7\nThe following table shows the percent of people who are lactose\nintolerant by race:\nTable 12.122 Lactose intolerance rates8\nRace or ethnicity % Lactose Intolerant\nSoutheast Asian 98%\nNative Americans 62-100%9\nAsian Americans 90%\nAlaskan Eskimo 80%\nAfrican-American Adults 79%\nMexicans (rural communities) 74%\nNorth American Jews 69%\nGreek Cypriots 66%\nCretans 56%\nMexican American Males 55%\nIndian Adults 50%\nAfrican-American Children 45%\nIndian Children 20%\nDescendants of N. Europeans 5%\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 559 Thus, you can see that many people are lactose intolerant.\nCoincidentally, many of these people have darker pigmented skin,\nmeaning that they have an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency/\ninsufficiency because they require greater sun exposure to\nsynthesize adequate amounts of vitamin D3.\nOther foods that are sometimes fortified are breakfast cereals and\norange juice. Despite the fact that orange juice doesn\u2019t contain fat,\nand vitamin D is fat-soluble, vitamin D is quite bioavailable in orange\njuice10.\nVitamin D in supplements is found as vitamin D2 or D3. However,\nbased on the recent evidence suggesting that D2 isn\u2019t as beneficial\nas D3, many are being reformulated to contain D311.\nReferences & Links\n1.

The other major regulators of blood\ncalcium levels are 2 hormones: parathyroid hormone (PTH) and\ncalcitonin, which are released from the parathyroid glands and\nthyroid glands, respectively. Bone serves as the calcium depot, or\nreservoir, if there is a sufficient concentration in the body. In bone,\ncalcium is found in hydroxyapatite crystals on a collagen matrix.\nThe chemical formula of hydroxyapatite is:\nCa10(PO4)6(OH)2\nCalcium and phosphorus are either jointly deposited (deposition)\nor jointly liberated (resorption) from bone hydroxyapatite to\nmaintain/achieve blood calcium concentrations. Osteoblasts are\nbone cells that are responsible for bone formation or depositing\nhydroxyapatite. Osteoclasts are the bone cells that are responsible\nfor breaking down or resorption of bone. An easy way to remember\nthe function of these cells is:\nOsteoblasts \u201cbuild\u201d bone\nOsteoclasts \u201cchew\u201d bone\nBone resorption is the process of liberating calcium and\nphosphorus from hydroxyapatite.\nBone deposition is the process of depositing calcium and\nphosphorus in bone as hydroxyapatite.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 561 Response to Low Blood Calcium\nThe parathyroid senses low blood calcium concentrations and\nreleases PTH. These steps are designed to maintain consistent\nblood calcium levels, but also affects phosphate (phosphorus) levels.\nPTH has 3 effects:\n1. Increases bone resorption\n2. Decreases calcium and increases phosphorus urinary excretion\n3. Increases 1,25(OH)2D activation in the kidney1,2\nThe first effect of PTH is increased bone resorption. Hydroxyapatite\nmust be broken down to release both calcium and phosphate. This\neffect is illustrated below.\nFigure 12.131 PTH effect 1: increased bone resorption3\nThe second effect of PTH is decreased calcium excretion in urine.\nThis is a result of increased calcium reabsorption by the kidney\nbefore it is excreted in urine. Kidney phosphate reabsorption is\ndecreased, meaning the net effect is less calcium, but more\nphosphate in urinary excretion, as shown in the figure below.\n562 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.132 PTH effect 2: decreased calcium, increased phosphorus\nexcretion3\nThe 3rd effect of PTH is that it increases 1,25(OH)2D activation in\nthe kidney, by increasing 1alpha-hydroxylase levels. The 1,25(OH)2D\nthen increases calcium and phosphorus absorption in the small\nintestine to help raise blood calcium levels, as shown below. This\nmechanism will be discussed in more detail in the vitamin D\nreceptor subsection.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 563 Figure 12.133 PTH effect 3: increased 1,25(OH)2D activation3\nOverall PTH causes more calcium and phosphate to be leached from\nbone, and absorbed from the intestine, into the blood. Coupled\nwith decreased calcium and increased phosphate urinary excretion,\nmeans that blood calcium levels rise without a marked rise in\nphosphate levels, as depicted in the figure below.\nFigure 12.134 1,25(OH)2D increased calcium and phosphorus absorption3\n564 | Human Nutrition References & Links\n1.

Many steroid hormones have\nnuclear receptors. The following figure illustrates the action of a\nnuclear hormone receptor.\nFigure 12.151 Nuclear hormone receptors action1\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 565 In the figure above of the hormone (in this case thyroid hormone),\nthe receptor\u2019s ligand (something that binds to the receptor), enters\nthe nucleus and binds to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). The\nTR has paired (formed a dimer) with the retinoid X receptor (RXR)\non the hormone response element (HRE) in the promoter of target\ngenes. The HRE for thyroid hormone is the thyroid hormone\nresponse element. Target genes are those whose transcription is\naltered by the hormone binding to its receptor on the response\nelement. The mRNA produced then leaves the nucleus where it is\ntranslated into protein.\nVitamin A and D have nuclear receptors that act in the same\nfashion as nuclear hormone receptors. The video below very clearly\nexplains the action of a nuclear hormone receptor. A thorough\nexplanation of the nuclear Vitamin D receptor follows.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Steroid Hormone Receptors (0:42)\n1,25(OH)2D is considered to be the active form of vitamin D because\nit is the form that binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Like\nthe thyroid hormone example above, there is a vitamin D response\nelement (VDRE) in the promoter of specific vitamin D target genes.\nIn the figure below, 25(OH)D, the major circulating form of vitamin\nD, is usually transported through the blood to the kidney by vitamin\nD binding protein (DBP). Again, the kidney converts 25(OH)D to\n1,25(OH)2D by use of the enzyme 1alpha-hydroxylase. 1,25(OH)2D\n(bound to DBP) moves from the kidney , or the tissue itself, into\nthe nucleus. It then binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), that\nis dimerized to the RXR on the vitamin D response element of\nthe target gene. Consequently, this then increases transcription of\nmRNA. The mRNA then moves into the cytoplasm to synthesize\nspecific proteins. This process is shown in the figure below.\n566 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.152 Vitamin D receptor and a generic target gene\nIt\u2019s through this action that 1,25(OH)2D is able to increase calcium\nabsorption. In this case, the target gene is the calcium-binding\nprotein calbindin. Thus, increased 1,25(OH)2D leads to increased\ncalbindin mRNA. This then leads to increased calbindin protein\nlevels. Calbindin will be discussed in more detail in the calcium\nsection.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 567 Figure 12.153 Vitamin D receptor and calbindin\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Type_ii_nuclear_receptor_action.png\nVideo\nSteroid Hormone Receptor \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=Dxyq8GAWbpo\n12.16 Vitamin D Deficiency, Toxicity &\nInsufficiency\nRickets is a vitamin D deficiency in infants and children. A lack\nof vitamin D leads to decreased bone mineralization, causing the\nbones to become weak. The bones then bow under pressure, leading\nto the characteristic bowed legs, as seen below.\n568 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.161 Children suffering from rickets1\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 569 Figure 12.162 X-ray from child suffering from\nrickets2\nAnother characteristic symptom of rickets is rachitic rosary, or\nbeaded ribs. The beading occurs at the areas where cartilage meets\nbone on the rib cage, as shown in the link below3.\nWeb Link\nRachitic Rosary\nOsteomalacia is a vitamin D deficiency in adults and results in poor\n570 | Human Nutrition bone mineralization. The bone becomes soft, resulting in bone pain\nand an increased risk of fractures3.\nWhile rickets and osteomalacia are fairly rare in the United States,\nit is believed that vitamin D insufficiency might be much more\nwidespread. Insufficiency means that the level of intake, or body\nstatus, is suboptimal (neither deficient nor optimal). The figure\nbelow illustrates this concept.\nFigure 12.163 Illustration of insufficient or suboptimal levels\nSuboptimal/insufficient means intake, or status, is higher than\ndeficient, but lower than optimal. Thus, higher intake levels will\nprovide additional benefits. The functions of vitamin D are growing\nby the day due to increased research discoveries. These functions\nnow include benefits beyond bone health, further supporting the\nimportance of vitamin D. In late 2010, an RDA for vitamin D was\nestablished (was an Adequate Intake before). This made it, along\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 571 with calcium, the first micronutrients to have their DRIs revised4.\nThe RDA for vitamin D is 3 times higher than the previous AI. Many\nbelieve these are more reasonable levels, while others think that the\nnew RDA is still not high enough. This belief, that many people\u2019s\nvitamin D intake/status is suboptimal, is challenged by a recent\nreview described in the link below that found that vitamin D did\nnot reduce osteoporosis risk. In addition, a recent meta-analysis\n(second link) concluded that \u201cthere is probably no benefit to expect\nfrom vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people.\u201d\nWeb Link\nVitamin D Ineffective for Preventing Osteoporosis\nLimits of Vitamin D Supplements\nVitamin D from supplements can become toxic. You cannot develop\nvitamin D toxicity from sun exposure, because the sunlight\ndegrades a precursor of vitamin D3 in the skin5. Vitamin D toxicity\nresults in hypercalcemia or high blood calcium levels. These become\nproblematic because it can lead to the calcification of soft tissues.\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rickets_USNLM.gif\n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:XrayRicketsLegssmall.jpg\n3.

The reason for calcium\u2019s abundance is its distribution in the\nskeleton, which contains 99% of the calcium in the body.\nSubsections:\n12.21 Calcium Absorption\n12.22 Calcium Bioavailability\n12.23 Calcium Functions\n12.24 Calcium Deficiency & Toxicity\n12.21 Calcium Absorption\nCalcium is taken up into the enterocyte through Transient Receptor\nPotential V6 (TRPV6), a calcium channel found on the brush border.\nCalbindin is the calcium binding protein that facilitates uptake\nthrough TRPV6 and transport across the enterocyte. Ca2+-Mg2+\nATPase functions to pump calcium out of the enterocyte and into\ncirculation and to pump magnesium into the enterocyte, as shown\nbelow1.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 573 Figure 12.211 Calcium uptake and absorption\nAs we have previously discussed, increased 1,25(OH)2D synthesis\nin the kidney causes increased binding to the vitamin D receptor,\nwhich increases calbindin synthesis. Increased calbindin ultimately\nincreases calcium uptake and absorption.\nFigure 12.212 Increased calbindin increases calcium absorption\n574 | Human Nutrition There are a couple of calcium-binding compounds that inhibit its\nabsorption. Therefore, even though some foods are good sources of\ncalcium, the calcium is not very bioavailable. Oxalate, found in high\nlevels in spinach, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, and dried beans, is the\nmost potent inhibitor of calcium absorption2. Recall that calcium\noxalate is one of the compounds that makes up kidney stones. Based\non this understanding, it should not be a surprise that formation of\nthis compound inhibits calcium absorption.\nFigure 12.213 Structure of calcium oxalate3\nAnother inhibitor of calcium absorption is phytate. Phytate is found\nin whole grains and legumes3.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 575 Figure 12.214 Structure of phytate4\nReferences & Links\n1. Gropper SS, Smith JL, Groff JL.

Because of this,\nintracellular calcium is tightly controlled, primarily stored within\norganelles.\nNon-bone functions include:\nNeurotransmitter release\n576 | Human Nutrition Neurotransmitter release is stimulated by the opening of voltage-\ngated Ca2+ channels. This stimulates the synaptic vesicle to fuse\nwith the axon membrane and release the neurotransmitter into the\nsynapse, as shown below1.\nFigure 12.231 Calcium regulates neurotransmitter release2\nMuscle contraction\nCalcium is released in muscle cells, where it binds to the protein\ntroponin, changes its shape, and removes the tropomyosin blockade\nof actin active sites so that contraction can occur3. This can be seen\nin the following animation and figure (same link).\nWeb Link\nMuscle contraction\nHormone release\nCalcium acts as an intracellular messenger for the release of\nhormones, such as insulin. The link below shows how in the beta\ncells of the pancreas, the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 577 stimulates the insulin granules to fuse with the beta cell membrane\nto release insulin.\nWeb Link\nInsulin release\nBlood Clotting\nAs will be discussed more in the vitamin K section, calcium\nbinding to activated Gla proteins is important in the blood clotting\ncascade.\nFigure 12.232 Calcium bind to Gla proteins. Adapted from reference 4\nEnzyme regulation\nThe binding of calcium to calcium-binding proteins also regulates\nthe action of a number of enzymes4.\nReferences & Links\n1.

In addition, calcium\ndeficiency in children can lead to rickets, which is a vitamin D\ndeficiency. While not a deficiency, low calcium intake can lead to\ndecreased bone mineral density and the conditions osteopenia and\nosteoporosis. How these differ from osteomalacia and normal bone\nis illustrated and described below. There are two different bone\ncomponents that we will consider to understand what is happening\nin the bone. Matrix is the scaffolding onto which mineral is\ndeposited. Mineral is at it sounds, the mineral that is deposited on\nthe matrix.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 579 Figure 12.241 Bone states; the width of each figure represents the bone mass.\nThe height of the matrix and mineral boxes represents the relative proportion\nfor matrix to mineral in the bone. Adapted from reference 3.\nOsteomalacia \u2013 Bone mass is normal, but the matrix to mineral ratio\nis increased, meaning there is less mineral in bone.\nOsteopenia \u2013 Bone mass is decreased, but the matrix to mineral\nratio is not altered from normal bone. This condition is intermediate\nin between normal and osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis \u2013 Bone mass is further decreased from osteopenia,\nbut the matrix to mineral ratio is not altered from normal bone3.\nTo prevent osteoporosis it is important to build peak bone mass,\n90% of which is built in females by age 18 and age 20 in males,\nbut can continue to increase until age 30. After that time, bone\nmass starts to decrease. For women after menopause, bone mass\n580 | Human Nutrition decreases dramatically because of the decrease in estrogen\nproduction, as shown in the link below5.\nWeb Link\nBone Mass\nCombining the decrease after menopause along with the fact that\nwomen have lower bone mass to begin with, helps further explain\nwhy osteoporosis is more common in females. A measure of bone\nstatus is bone mineral density. As the name indicates, bone mineral\ndensity is a measure of the amount of mineral in bone. Dual energy\nX-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) accurately measures bone mineral\ndensity using a small amount of radiation. A DEXA is shown in the\nfigure below.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 581 Figure 12.242 DEXA scanner6\nA person lies down on the table and the arm of the machine moves\nslowly over them.\nFrom the scan, a bone mineral density t-score is generated. As\nshown below, normal bone mineral density has a t-score of greater\n582 | Human Nutrition than -1, low bone mass is from -1 to -2.5, and osteoporosis is a t-\nscore of less that -2.5 as illustrated in the figure in the link below.\nWeb Link\nBone Mineral Density T-Scores\nThere are other methods of measuring bone mineral density, such\nas peripheral DEXA and ultrasound. These typically are done on the\nwrist or heel, but are not as accurate because that one area might\nnot reflect the bone mineral density in other parts of the body7.\nCalcium toxicity is rare, occurring in those with\nhyperparathyroidism or high calcium supplementation levels. Like\nvitamin D, toxicity can lead to calcification of soft tissues7. In\naddition, a very high intake of calcium can lead to kidney stone\nformation.\nReferences & Links\n1.

Animal\nproducts are rich sources of phosphate. Plant products contain\nphosphorus, but some is in the form of phytic acid (phytate). In\ngrains, over 80% of the phosphorus is phytate. This structure is\nshown below1.\nFigure 12.31 Structure of phytic acid2\nThe bioavailability of phosphorus from phytate is poor (~50%)\nbecause we lack the enzyme phytase3. Nevertheless, ~50-70% of\nphosphorus is estimated to be absorbed from our diet1. Another\nsource of phosphorus is phosphoric acid that is used to acidify\n584 | Human Nutrition colas. Colas are caramel-colored, carbonated soft drinks that\ncontain caffeine, such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, etc. Epidemiological\nstudies have found that soft drink consumption is associated with\ndecreased bone mineral densities, particularly in females4,5. It has\nbeen hypothesized that phosphoric acid plays some role in this\neffect, but there is limited evidence to support this belief.\nMost phosphorus is excreted in the urine.\nPhosphorus deficiency is rare, but can hinder bone and teeth\ndevelopment. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, rickets,\nand bone pain6. Toxicity is also rare, but it causes low blood calcium\nconcentrations and tetany1.\nSubsection:\n12.31 Phosphorus Functions\nReferences & Links\n1. Gropper SS, Smith JL, Groff JL.

It is not required by the body\nand it is not widely found in the food supply. The majority of what\nwe consume comes from fluoridated water. Other good non-dietary\nsources are fluoridated toothpaste and dental rinses1. Absorption of\nfluoride is near 100% for both dietary and non-dietary forms and it\nis rapidly excreted in the urine2.\nFluoride alters the mineralization of bones and teeth. It does\nthis by replacing hydroxyl (OH) ions in hydroxyapatite\n(Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) , forming fluorohydroxyapatite.\nFluorohydroxyapatite is more resistant to acid degradation than\nhydroxyapatite, leading to fewer cavities2.\nSince it is a nonessential mineral, there is no fluoride deficiency.\nHowever, fluoride can be quite toxic. Acute toxicity symptoms from\nlarge intakes of fluoride include1:\nNausea\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nConvulsions\nChronic toxicity results in an irreversible condition known as\nfluorosis, characterized by the mottling and pitting of teeth as\nshown below.\n590 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.41 Fluorosis3\nFigure 12.42 Severe case of fluorosis4\nAs you can see from the figure below, fluorosis is more prevalent in\nthe United States than most people would probably believe.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 591 Figure 12.43 Fluorosis prevalence by age in the United States5\nA comparison of the prevalence of fluorosis in US children, ages\n12-15, indicates an increase from the late 1980s to the early 2000s5.\n592 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.44 Change in dental fluorosis in 12-15 year-old US children5\nThere is debate as to whether water should be fluoridated.

Menaquinone comprises ~10% of absorbed\nvitamin K every day and can also be found in small amounts in\nanimal products. Its structure is shown below3.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 595 Figure 12.52 Structure of menaquinone (K2).

The\nstructure of glutamic acid is shown below.\nFigure 12.511 Structure of glutamic acid1\nThe enzyme, gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, uses a vitamin K\ncofactor to convert glutamic acid to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid\n(Gla). Gla proteins are those that contain glutamic acid(s) that have\nbeen converted to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid(s). The formation\n598 | Human Nutrition of Gla proteins allows the 2 positive charges of calcium to bind\nbetween the 2 negative charges on the carboxylic acid groups\n(COO-) in the Gla. The binding of calcium activates these\nproteins2-4.\nFigure 12.512 Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase converts glutamic acid to\ngamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla).\nGla proteins are important in blood clotting. Blood clotting occurs\nthrough a cascade of events, as shown in the following 2 videos. The\nanimation below gives an overview of blood clotting, the video is a\nfun depiction of the blood clotting cascade.\nWeb Links\nHemostasis Animation\nVideo: The Clotting Cascade (1:20)\nWithin the blood clotting cascade, there a number of potential Gla\nproteins, as shown in the figure below.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 599 Figure 12.513 Blood clotting cascade with potential Gla proteins circled5\nIf these proteins within the blood clotting cascade are not activated\nto Gla, the cascade does not proceed as normal, leading to impaired\nblood clotting. After being used as a cofactor by gamma-glutamyl\ncarboxylase to produce a Gla protein, vitamin K becomes vitamin K\nepoxide. Vitamin K epoxide needs to be converted back to vitamin\nK to serve as a cofactor again. Warfarin (Coumadin) and dicumarol\nare a couple of blood thinning drugs that inhibit this regeneration\nof vitamin K. This reduces the amount of Gla in the blood clotting\nproteins ,thus reducing the clotting response. The structure of\nwarfarin and dicumarol are shown below5.\n600 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.514 Structure of warfarin7\nFigure 12.515 Structure of dicumarol8\nThe following coumadin rap song video gives further information on\nwarfarin.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 601 Web Link\nVideo: Coumadin Rap Song (3:44)\nVitamin K may also be important for bone health. There are 3 Gla\nproteins found in bone: osteocalcin, matrix Gla protein (MGP), and\nprotein S6. Osteocalcin is a major bone protein, constituting 15-20%\nof all non-collagen proteins in bone. However, overall, the function\nof these 3 proteins in bone is not known2,3.

They\nare at higher risk, because there is poor transfer of vitamin K across\nthe placental barrier, their gastrointestinal tracts do not contain\nvitamin K producing bacteria, and breast milk is generally low in\nvitamin K1. As a result, it is recommended (and widely practiced)\nthat all infants receive a vitamin K injection within 6 hours of birth2.\nProlonged antibiotic treatment (which kills bacteria in the\ngastrointestinal tract) and lipid absorption problems can also lead\nto vitamin K deficiency3. Vitamin K deficient individuals have an\nincreased risk of bleeding or hemorrhage. Remember that high\nlevels of alpha-tocopherol intake can also interfere with vitamin\nK\u2019s blood clotting function. It is believed that an alpha-tocopherol\nmetabolite, with similar structure to the vitamin K quinones,\nantagonizes the action of vitamin K.\nPhylloquinone and menaquinone have no reported toxicities.\nHowever, menadione can cause liver damage1.\nReferences & Links\n1.

Retinol is the alcohol (OH)\nform, retinal is the aldehyde (COH) form, and retinoic acid is the\ncarboxylic acid (COOH) form, as shown in the figure below (areas of\ndifference are indicated by red).\nFigure 12.61 Structure of the retinoids1\nAmong these different retinoids, retinol and retinal are fairly\ninterchangeable. Either form is readily converted to the other.\nHowever, only retinal is used to form retinoic acid, and this is a\none-way reaction. Thus, once retinoic acid is formed it can\u2019t be\nconverted back to retinal, as shown in the figure below.\n604 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.62 Metabolism of retinoids1\nThere are 2 primary dietary sources of vitamin A:\nRetinyl/retinol esters (Animal Products)\nProvitamin A Carotenoids (Plants)\nPreformed vitamin A means that the compound is a retinoid.\nPreformed vitamin A is only found in animal products (carrots are\nnot a good source of preformed vitamin A). Most retinol in animal\nproducts is esterified, or has a fatty acid added it, to form retinyl\nesters (aka retinol esters).

However, the 6 main ones found\nin the diet and in the body are1:\nBeta-carotene\nAlpha-carotene\nBeta-cryptoxanthin\nLutein\nZeaxanthin\nLycopene\nMany carotenoids are pigments, meaning they are colored. The\ntable below gives the color of some of these carotenoids, as well as\nsome food sources.\nTable 12.611 Carotenoids\u2019 color and food sources\n606 | Human Nutrition Carotenoid Color Food Sources\nBeta-carotene Orange Carrots, Sweet Potatoes, Leafy Greens\nLycopene Red Tomatoes, Watermelon, Pink Grapefruit\nLutein/Zeaxanthin Yellow Kale, Corn, Egg Yolks, Spinach\nCarotenoids can be further classified as provitamin A or non-\nprovitamin A. Provitamin A carotenoids are those that can be\ncleaved to form retinal, while the non-provitamin A carotenoids\ncannot. The structure and classification of the 6 major carotenoids\nare shown below.\nFigure 12.611 Structure and classification of the 6 major carotenoids\nAfter provitamin A carotenoids are taken up into the enterocyte,\nsome are cleaved to form retinal. In the case of symmetrical beta-\ncarotene, it is cleaved in the center to form 2 retinal molecules as\nshown below.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 607 Figure 12.612 Cleavage of beta-carotene 2 to retinal molecules2\nAlpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin are asymmetrical, thus\nthey can be used to form only 1 retinal.\nTo help account for the fact that retinol can be made from\ncarotenoids, the DRI committee made retinol activity equivalents\n(RAE) that take into account the bioavailability and bioconversion of\nthe provitamin A carotenoids.\n1 ug RAE\n= 1 ug of retinol\n= 2 ug of supplemental beta-carotene\n= 12 ug of dietary beta-carotene\n= 24 ug of alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin3\nReferences & Links\n1.

Adapted\nfrom reference 1\nEsters are removed by esterases so that free retinol can be taken\nup into the enterocyte. Preformed vitamin A is highly bioavailable\n(70-90%) if consumed with some fat2. Carotenoids have a much\nlower bioavailability, which varies based on the carotenoid and\nmatrix it is in when consumed. Once provitamin A carotenoids are\ntaken up into the enterocytes, they are: (1) cleaved to retinal and\nthen converted to retinol or (2) absorbed intact and incorporated\ninto chylomicrons.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 609 Retinol in the enterocyte is esterified, forming retinyl esters. The\nretinyl esters are packaged into chylomicrons (CM) and enter the\nlymph system. Once the chylomicrons reach circulation,\ntriglycerides are cleaved off to form chylomicron remnants (CM\nRem). These are taken up by hepatocytes, where the retinyl esters\nare de-esterified to form retinol. The liver is the major storage\nsite of vitamin A. For storage, the retinol will be transported from\nthe hepatocytes to the stellate cells and converted back to retinyl\nesters, the storage form of vitamin A.\nIf vitamin A is needed to be released into circulation, retinol will\ncombine with retinol binding protein (RBP). Retinol + RBP are then\nbound to a large transport protein, transthyretin (TTR). It is believed\nthat retinol + RBP would be filtered out by the kidney and excreted\nin urine if it was not bound to TTR1.\nAfter it is further metabolized, 60% of vitamin A is excreted in the\nurine, 40% in feces2.\nReferences & Links\n1.

Vitamin A\ntechnically has two nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors\n(RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Vitamin A, like\npolyunsaturated fatty acids, can be found in trans and cis forms,\ndepending on the conformation of its double bonds. The ligand\nfor RARs is all-trans-retinoic acid, and the ligand for RXRs is 9-cis\nretinoic acid.\n610 | Human Nutrition As shown in the figure below, all-trans retinol is brought to the\ncell by RBP and TTR. All-trans retinol is converted to all-trans-\nretinal, and then to all-trans-retinoic acid. RAR and RXR are paired,\nor dimerized, on the retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the\npromoter region of target genes. The binding of all-trans retinoic\nacid causes the transcription and ultimately the translation of target\nproteins. This is why all-trans-retinoic acid is the active form of\nvitamin A because it is the ligand for RARs, leading to many of the\nbiologic effects attributed to vitamin A.\nFigure 12.631 All-trans retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors\nNo References\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 611 12.64 Vitamin A Functions\nVitamin A has a number of important functions in the body.\nVision\nThe retina is the inner back lining of the eye that takes visual\nimages and turns them into nerve signals that are sent to the brain\nto form the images that we \u201csee\u201d, as shown in the following link1.\nWeb Link\nRetina\nInside the retina are the photoreceptor cells, rods and cones. Cones\nare responsible for color vision, while rods are important for seeing\nblack and white. Within the rods, 11-cis retinal combines with the\nprotein, opsin, to form rhodopsin. When light strikes rhodopsin, the\ncompound splits into opsin and all-trans retinal. This sends a signal\nto your brain for us to \u201csee\u201d. This process is illustrated in the figure\nbelow1.\n612 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.641 Vitamin A in the rod\nMost all-trans retinal is converted back to 11-cis retinal through a\nseries of steps so it can continue to be used to form rhodopsin.\nHowever, this recycling is not 100% efficient. Vitamin A stores, or\ncontinued intake, is required to provide the 11-cis retinal needed to\ncontinue to form rhodopsin. Normally, our eyes adapt to darkness\nby increasing the amount of rhodopsin available so we can see\nunder reduced light conditions1. If a person does not have enough\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 613 rhodopsin he/she will become night blind, meaning his/her eyes\ndo not adjust, or adjust very slowly, preventing he/she from seeing\nunder limited light conditions. The picture below is an example of\nwhat night blindness looks like.\nFigure 12.642 The left is normal vision, the right is what someone with night\nblindness would see2.\nCell Differentiation\nVitamin A, in particular retinoic acid, is important for cell\ndifferentiation, or the ability of stem cells to develop into\nspecialized cells.\n614 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.642 Cellular differentiation3\nOther functions that vitamin A is important for include:\nGrowth and development\nReproduction\nImmune function\nReferences & Links\n1.

In many developing countries, they do not\nhave a stable dietary source of retinoids or provitamin A\ncarotenoids. The figure below gives you an idea of countries where\nvitamin A deficiency is a problem.\nFigure 12.651 Prevalence of vitamin A deficiency worldwide1\nOften the earliest symptom of vitamin A deficiency is night\nblindness, due to the insufficient production of rhodopsin. The\nreason that this is the earliest symptom, is that circulating vitamin\nA levels are homeostatically-controlled, meaning that they do not\nchange until after vitamin A stores are exhausted. This means that\n616 | Human Nutrition blood, serum, plasma measurements are going to appear normal\nuntil all stores are exhausted. As a result, sensitively assessing\nsomeone as vitamin A deficient can be challenging. There are\nfurther changes to the eye that occur during vitamin A deficiency,\ncollectively referred to as xerophthalmia, which are shown in the\nlink below.\nWeb Link\nThe eye signs of vitamin A deficiency\nUltimately the person can become blind. Vitamin A deficiency is the\nleading cause of blindness in some parts of the world2.\nAnother symptom of vitamin A deficiency is hyperkeratosis. In\nthis condition, cells overproduce the protein keratin, causing the\nskin to become rough and irritated, as shown in the link below2.\nWeb Link\nHyperkeratosis (inactive link as of 05/18/2021)\nOne way to counter vitamin A deficiency in developing countries is\nfor staple crops, like rice and corn, to contain beta-carotene. In the\ncase of rice, Golden Rice was genetically modified to produce beta-\ncarotene. A second generation of golden rice, known as Golden Rice\n2, has now been developed. However, politics and regulations have\nprevented it from being used. This is described in the first link. The\nsecond link is a nice figure that details the progress towards Golden\nRice being used. The third link describes the issues with how some\nresearch with it was conducted. The fourth link is an opinion article\nthat gives you a feel for the opposition to its use.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 617 Web Links\nGolden Rice\nGolden Rice Project\nGolden Rice Not So Golden for Tufts\n\u2018Golden Rice\u2019: A Dengvaxia fiasco waiting to happen\nThere are also corn varieties that have been bred to produce high\namounts of beta-carotene, as described in the link below.\nWeb Link\nNew Yellow Corn Could Boost Vitamin A, Save Sight\nVitamin A can be very toxic and can cause serious symptoms, such\nas blurred vision, liver abnormalities, skin disorders, and joint\npain2,3. In addition, research has suggested that people who\nconsume high levels of vitamin A are more prone to bone fractures2.\nToxic levels of vitamin A are also teratogenic, which means they\ncould cause birth defects.\nThis is important to keep in mind because a vitamin A derivative\nisotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) is the active ingredient in the oral\nacne medication, Accutane. Accutane is effective, as you can see in\nthe video below.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Accutane (1:10)\nHowever, due to the number of adverse events reported from its\nconsumption, Accutane was recalled from the US market in 20094.\nIsotretinoin medications though are still commonly prescribed.\nRetin-A is a topical product of all-trans-retinoic acid. Women\nof childbearing age need to exercise caution when using these\nproducts due to the risk of birth defects, should they become\npregnant3. People should not consume huge doses of vitamin A\nexpecting to get the same effects seen from these 2 medications5.\nIt is important to note that you cannot develop vitamin A toxicity\n618 | Human Nutrition from consuming too much beta-carotene or other provitamin A\ncarotenoids. Instead, a nontoxic condition known as\ncarotenodermia occurs when large amounts of beta-carotene are\nconsumed, where the accumulation of the carotenoid in the fat\nbelow the skin causes the skin to look orange, as shown in the link\nbelow.\nWeb Link\nCarotenodermia\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vitamin_A_deficiency.PNG\n2.

Heme iron is only found in foods of animal origin, within\nhemoglobin and myoglobin. The structure of heme iron is shown\nbelow.\nFigure 12.71 Structure of heme iron1\n620 | Human Nutrition Approximately 40% of iron in meat, fish, and poultry is heme-iron,\nand the other 60% is non-heme iron2.\nNon-heme iron is the mineral alone, in either its oxidized or\nreduced form. The 2 forms of iron are:\nFerric (Fe3+, oxidized)\nFerrous (Fe2+, reduced)\nIt is estimated that 25% of heme iron and 17% of non-heme iron\nare absorbed2. Approximately 85-90% of the iron we consume is\nnon-heme iron2,3.\nIn addition to getting iron from food sources, if food is cooked in\ncast iron cookware, a small amount of iron can be transferred to the\nfood.\nMany breakfast cereals are fortified with reduced iron, which\nlooks like iron filings, as the following video shows.\nWeb Link\nVideo: Iron for breakfast (1:02)\nWhile the iron bioavailability of this reduced iron is low, some is\nabsorbed4.\nSupplements\nMost iron supplements use ferrous (Fe2+) iron, because this form\nis better absorbed, as discussed in the next section. The figure\nbelow shows the percent of elemental iron in different supplements.\nThis is the percentage of elemental iron that is in each compound.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 621 Figure 12.72 Elemental iron in different iron supplements3\nVitamin C does not increase absorption of ferrous supplements\nbecause they are already in reduced form, as discussed in the\nfollowing subsection2. Iron chelates are marketed as being better\nabsorbed than other forms of iron supplements, but this has not\nbeen proven5. It is recommended that supplements are not taken\nwith meals, because they are better absorbed when not consumed\nwith food2.\nSubsections:\n12.71 Iron Uptake & Absorption\n12.72 Iron Transport & Storage\n12.73 Iron Functions\n12.74 Iron Deficiency & Toxicity\nReferences & Links\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Heme.svg\n2.

Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing.\nVideo\nIron for breakfast \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=pRK15XSqtAw\n12.71 Iron Uptake & Absorption\nThere are 2 transporters for iron, one for heme iron and one for\nnon-heme iron. The non-heme transporter is the divalent mineral\ntransporter 1 (DMT1), which transports Fe2+ into the enterocyte.\nHeme iron is taken up through heme carrier protein 1 (HCP-1), and\nthen metabolized to Fe2+. Fe2+ may be used by enzymes and other\nproteins or stored in the enterocyte bound to ferritin, the iron\nstorage protein. To reach circulation, iron is transported through\nferroportin1,2. This process is summarized in the figure below.\nFigure 12.711 Iron uptake into the enterocyte\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 623 Since only the reduced form of non-heme iron (Fe2+) is taken up,\nFe3+ must be reduced. There is a reductase enzyme on the brush\nborder, duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), that catalyzes the\nreduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, as shown below. Vitamin C enhances\nnon-heme iron absorption because it is required by Dcytb for this\nreaction. Thus, if dietary non-heme iron is consumed with vitamin\nC, more non-heme iron will be reduced to Fe2+ and taken up into\nthe enterocyte through DMT1.\nFigure 12.712 Reduction of non-heme iron by Dcytb\nIn addition to vitamin C, there is an unidentified factor in muscle\n624 | Human Nutrition that enhances non-heme iron absorption if consumed at the same\nmeal3. This unidentified factor is referred to as meat protein factor\n(MPF). The table shows how MPF can increase non-heme iron\nabsorption.\nTable 12.711 Non-heme iron absorption from chicken or beef\nmuscle fraction3\nMean Fe\nAbsorption Egg Whole Whole Muscle Heme-Free\nAlbumin Muscle Protein Muscle Protein\n(% of Dose)\nChicken 8.41 16.43 26.98 36.81\nBeef 11.21 31.52 44.15 38.29\nAlbumin is a protein, so the egg albumin represents a non-meat\nprotein standard for comparison. You can see that absorption is\nmuch higher with whole muscle. When only consuming muscle\nprotein, there is a slight increase from muscle itself, and when they\nlook at heme-free muscle iron, absorption is still higher than egg\nalbumin3.\nInhibitors of non-heme iron absorption typically chelate, or bind,\nthe iron to prevent absorption. Phytates (phytic acid), which also\ninhibit calcium absorption, chelate non-heme iron decreasing its\nabsorption.\nFigure 12.713 Structure of phytic acid4\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 625 Other compounds that inhibit absorption are:\nPolyphenols (coffee, tea)1\nFigure 12.714 Structure of gallic acid, a\npolyphenol5\nOxalate (spinach, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, and dried beans)2\n626 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.715 Structure of calcium oxalate6\nCalcium is also believed to inhibit iron uptake.\nReferences & Links\n1.

Fe3+ is the form of iron that binds to transferrin, so\nthe Fe2+ transported through ferroportin must be oxidized to Fe3+.\nThere are 2 copper-containing proteins that catalyze this oxidation\nof Fe2+: hephaestin and ceruloplasmin. Hephaestin is found in the\nmembrane of enterocytes, while ceruloplasmin is the major copper\ntransport protein in blood. Hephaestin is the primary protein that\nperforms this function in a coupled manner (occur together) with\ntransport through ferroportin. This means that the Fe2+ being\ntransported through ferroportin is oxidized by hephaestin.\nEvidence suggests that ceruloplasmin is involved in oxidizing Fe2+\nwhen iron status is low1. Once oxidized, Fe3+ binds to transferrin\nand is transported to a tissue cell that contains a transferrin\nreceptor. Transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor and is\nendocytosed, as shown below2.\nFigure 12.721 Transport and uptake of iron\n628 | Human Nutrition Once inside cells, the iron can be used for cellular purposes\n(cofactor for enzyme etc.) or it can be stored in the iron storage\nproteins ferritin or hemosiderin. Ferritin is the primary iron storage\nprotein, but at higher concentrations, iron is also stored in\nhemosiderin2.\nFigure 12.722 Fates of iron within cells\nThere are 3 major compartments of iron in the body3:\n1. Functional Iron\n2. Storage Iron\n3. Transport Iron\nFunctional iron consists of iron performing some function. There\nare 3 functional iron subcompartments.\n1. Hemoglobin\n2. Myoglobin\n3. Iron-containing enzymes\nThe functions of these subcompartments are discussed in the next\nsection.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 629 Iron Stores consist of:\n1. Ferritin\n2. Hemosiderin\nThe liver is the primary storage site in the body, with the spleen and\nbone marrow being the other major storage sites.\nCirculating iron is found in transferrin3.\nThe following table shows how much iron is distributed among\nthe different compartments.\nTable 12.721 Iron Distribution in adults (mg Fe/kg body weight)3\nMen Women\nFunctional iron\nHemoglobin 32 28\nMyoglobin 5 4\nFe-containing enzymes 1-2 1-2\nStorage iron\nFerritin and hemosiderin ~11 ~6\nTransport iron\nTransferrin 0.04 0.04\nHopefully you notice that the majority of iron is in the functional\niron compartment. The figure below further reinforces this point,\nshowing that most iron is found in red blood cells (hemoglobin) and\ntissues (myoglobin).\n630 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.723 Iron distribution in different compartments4\nAlso notice how small oral intake and excretion are compared to\nthe amount found in the different compartments in the body. As\na result, iron recycling is really important, because red blood cells\nonly live for 120 days. Red blood cells are broken down in the liver,\nspleen, and bone marrow and the iron can be used for the same\npurposes as described earlier: cellular use, storage, or transported\nto another tissue on transferrin2. Most of this iron will be used\nfor heme and ultimately red blood cell synthesis. The figure below\nsummarizes the potential uses of iron recycled from red blood cells.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 631 Figure 12.724 Iron recycling from red blood cells\nIron is unique among minerals in that our body has limited excretion\nability. Thus, absorption is controlled by the hormone hepcidin. The\nliver has an iron sensor so when iron levels get high, this sensor\nsignals for the release of hepcidin. Hepcidin causes degradation\nof ferroportin. Thus, the iron is not able to be transported into\ncirculation5.\n632 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.725 Action of hepcidin4\nThe iron is now trapped in the enterocyte, which is eventually\nsloughed off and excreted in feces. Thus, iron absorption is\ndecreased through the action of hepcidin.\nFigure 12.726 Enterocytes are sloughed off the villus and unless digested and\ntheir components reabsorbed, they will be excreted in feces\nReferences & Links\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 633 1.

The red above the table is meant to represent\nthe amount of iron in the different compartments. In early negative\niron balance stage, iron stores are slightly depleted. Once the stores\nare almost completely exhausted, this state is referred to as iron\ndepletion. In iron deficiency, stores are completely exhausted and\nthe circulating and functional iron levels are also depleted. In iron\nanemia, the circulating and functional iron levels are further\ndepleted from iron-deficiency.\n1 Great measure, but invasive\n2 Small amount are released from liver, bone, and spleen \u2013\nproportional to body stores\n3 Also referred to as total iron-binding capacity\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 637 Figure 12.741 Measures of iron status1-3\nThe most common measures of iron status are hemoglobin\nconcentrations and hematocrit (described below) levels. A\ndecreased amount of either measure indicates iron deficiency, but\nthese two measures are among the last to indicate that iron status\nis depressed. This is because, as you can see in the figure above,\ncirculating iron (plasma iron) levels are not altered until you reach\niron deficiency. Thus, other measures are likely better choices1.\nThe hematocrit, as illustrated in the figure below, is a measure\nof the proportion of red blood cells (erythrocytes) as compared to\nall other components of blood. The components are separated by\na centrifuge. The red blood cells remain at the bottom of the tube.\nThey can be quantified by measuring the packed cell volume (PCV)\nrelative to the total whole blood volume.\n638 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.742 Hematocrit figures4,5\nOne of the best measures of iron status is bone marrow iron, but\nthis is an invasive measure, and is therefore not commonly used.\nPlasma ferritin, the iron storage protein, is also found in lower\namounts in the blood (plasma) and is a good indicator of iron stores.\nThus, it is a sensitive measure to determine if someone is in negative\niron balance or iron depleted. It is not as useful of a measure beyond\nthis stage because the iron stores have been exhausted for the\nmost part. Transferrin iron binding capacity (aka total iron binding\ncapacity), as it sounds, is a measure of how much iron transferrin\ncan bind. An increase in transferrin iron binding capacity indicates\ndeficiency (>400 indicates deficiency). But the best measure for\ndeficiency or anemia is either percent serum transferrin saturation\nor plasma iron. A lower % saturation means that less of the\ntransferrin are saturated or carrying the maximum amount of iron\nthat they can handle. Plasma iron is easily understood as the amount\nof iron within the plasma1.\nIron deficiency is the most common deficiency worldwide,\nestimated to affect 1.6 billion people. In the US, it is less common,\nbut an estimated 10% of toddlers and women of childbearing age\nare deficient. Iron deficiency often results in a microcytic (small\ncell), hypochromic (low color) anemia, that is a result of decreased\nhemoglobin production. With decreased hemoglobin, the red blood\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 639 cells cannot carry as much oxygen. Decreased oxygen leads to\nslower metabolism. Thus, a person with this anemia feels fatigued,\nweak, apathetic, and can experience headaches6. Other side effects\ninclude decreased immune function and delayed cognitive\ndevelopment in children7.\nThose who are particularly at risk are1,7:\nWomen of childbearing age \u2013 because of losses due to\nmenstruation\nPregnant women \u2013 because of increased blood volume\nVegetarians \u2013 because they do not consume heme iron sources\nInfants \u2013 because they have low iron stores that can quickly be\ndepleted\nTo give you a better understanding of these risks, it is helpful to\nlook at how much higher the RDAs are for women of reproductive\nage and pregnant women compared to men8.\nWomen of reproductive age 18 mg/day\nPregnancy 27 mg/day\nMen 8 mg/day\nTo put this in perspective, 3 oz of beef contains ~3 mg of iron.\nThus, it can be a challenge for some women to meet the\nrequirement. The RDA committee estimates the iron requirements\nto be 80% and 70% higher for vegans and endurance athletes,\nrespectively. The increased requirement for endurance athletes is\nbased on loss due to \u201cfoot strike hemolysis\u201d, or the increased\nrupture of red blood cells due to the striking of the foot on hard\nsurfaces3.\nIron toxicity is rare in adults, but can occur in children who\nconsume too many supplements containing iron. Symptoms of this\nacute toxicity include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea7.\n50 out of 10,000 newborns in the United States are born with\nthe genetic condition, hemochromatosis. In this condition, there is\na mutation in a protein in the enterocyte that prevents the normal\ndecrease of intestinal iron absorption. Without this protein these\nindividuals cannot decrease iron absorption. Since the body cannot\n640 | Human Nutrition excrete iron, it accumulates in tissues, and ultimately can result in\norgan failure1.\nReferences & Links\n1. Gropper SS, Smith JL, Groff JL.

It may be DMT1 that\ntakes up non-heme iron. Once inside the enterocyte, Cu1+ can1:\n1. Bind to thionein to form metallothionein.

The liver\nis the primary site of storage, where copper is taken up through an\nunknown transporter. If it is going to be stored, it will bind with\nthionein to form metallothionein. Copper to be sent out to the body\nis transferred to the copper transport protein ceruloplasmin, which\ncan bind 6 coppers/protein as shown below1.\nFigure 12.92 Copper in the hepatocyte\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 653 Legumes, whole grains, nuts, shellfish, and seeds are good sources\nof copper2.

When it binds a mineral, it becomes\nmetallothionein. High zinc intake results in increased thionein\nsynthesis in the enterocyte. Thus, when an individual is consuming\nhigh zinc levels, the enterocyte will have high levels of thionein as\nshown below.\n660 | Human Nutrition Figure 12.931 Zinc increases thionein production\nThe high levels of thionein will bind any copper that is taken up into\nthe enterocyte (as metallothionein), \u201ctrapping\u201d the copper in the\nenterocyte and preventing it from being absorbed into circulation,\nas shown below.\nFigure 12.932 Copper taken up into the enterocyte is bound to thionein\nforming metallothionein.\nBlood, Bones & Teeth Micronutrients | 661 The enterocytes containing the \u201ctrapped\u201d copper move up the crypt\nand are sloughed off and excreted in feces.

Sodium is taken up\ninto the enterocyte through multiple mechanisms before being\npumped out of the enterocyte by sodium-potassium (Na+/K+)\nATPase.

Muscle contraction and nerve transmission (not discussed\nfurther below)\n668 | Human Nutrition Fluid balance\nThe body regulates sodium and fluid levels through a series of\nprocesses as shown below. A decrease in plasma volume and blood\npressure signals the kidney to release the enzyme renin. Renin\nactivates angiotensin that is converted to angiotensin II.\nAngiotensin II signals the adrenal glands to secrete the hormone\naldosterone. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption in the\nkidney, thus decreasing sodium excretion. These actions cause\nplasma sodium concentrations to increase, which is detected by\nthe hypothalamus. The hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland\nto release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that causes the kidneys to\nreabsorb water, decreasing water excretion. The net result is an\nincrease in blood volume and blood pressure1.\nFigure 13.22 Response to decreased plasma volume and blood pressure\n2.

Salt and/or sodium intake is believed to\nbe a major causative factor in the development of hypertension.\nHowever, it is now known that not everyone is salt-sensitive. Salt-\nsensitive means that a person\u2019s blood pressure increases with\nincreased salt intake and decreases with decreased salt intake.\nApproximately 25% of normotensive (normal blood pressure)\nindividuals and 50% of hypertensive individuals are salt-sensitive2.\nMost others are salt-insensitive, and in a small portion of\nindividuals, low salt consumption actually increases blood\npressure1. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a clinical method to determine\nwhether a person is salt-sensitive. There are some known\ncharacteristics that increase the likelihood of an individual being\nsalt-sensitive. They are1:\nElderly\nFemale\nAfrican-American\nHypertensive\nDiabetic\nChronic Kidney Disease\nThere is some evidence now suggesting that there may be\nnegative effects in some people who restrict their sodium intakes\nto the levels recommended by some organizations. The second link\ndescribes a couple of studies that had conflicting outcomes as it\nrelates to the importance of salt reduction in decreasing blood\npressure and cardiovascular disease. The third link is to a study\nthat found that higher potassium consumption, not lower sodium\nconsumption, was associated with decreased blood pressure in\nadolescent teenage girls.\n676 | Human Nutrition Web Link\nReport Questions Reducing Salt Intake Too Dramatically\nPour on the Salt? New Research Suggests More Is OK\nFor Teenagers, Potassium May Matter More Than Salt\nTo combat hypertension, the Dietary Approaches to Stop\nHypertension (DASH) diet was developed. This diet emphasizes:\nfruits, vegetables, fat-free/low-fat milk and milk products, whole\ngrain products, fish, poultry, nuts\nIt limits:\nred meat, sweets, added sugars, sugar-containing beverages\nAs a result the diet is high in:\npotassium, magnesium, calcium, protein, fiber\nThe daily goals for the DASH diet are shown below:\nFigure 13.61 DASH daily nutrient goals3\nElectrolyte Micronutrients | 677 To get an idea of what types of foods and how much would be\nconsumed in the diet, an eating plan is shown below.\nFigure 13.62 DASH eating plan3\nThe DASH diet has been shown to be remarkably effective in\ndecreasing blood pressure in those with hypertension.\nNevertheless, most people with hypertension aren\u2019t following the\nDASH diet. In fact, evidence from the National Health and Nutrition\n678 | Human Nutrition Examination Survey found that significantly fewer hypertensive\nindividuals were following the DASH diet in 1999-2004 than during\n1988-1994, as shown in the table below4.\nTable 13.61 Percent of hypertensive subjects in NHANES trial\nmeeting the DASH goals4\nNHANES NHANES\n1988-1994 1999-2004 Absolute\nVariable p-value\nChange (%)\n(n = 4336) (n = 3821)\nDASH\n29.3 \u00b1 1.5 21.7 \u00b1 1.3 -7.6 <0.001\nAccordance\nTotal Fat 42.9 \u00b1 1.8 35.9 \u00b1 2.0 -7.0 0.01\nSaturated\n20.6 \u00b1 1.2 20.4 \u00b1 1.4 -0.2 0.94\nFat\nProtein 43.7 \u00b1 2.0 47.7 \u00b1 1.9 4.0 0.73\nCholesterol 26.4 \u00b1 2.2 24.3 \u00b1 1.6 -2.1 0.44\nFiber 20.2 \u00b1 1.5 12.3 \u00b1 0.9 -7.9 <0.001\nMagnesium 14.2 \u00b1 1.3 6.4 \u00b1 0.8 -7.8 <0.001\nCalcium 19.0 \u00b1 1.6 17.6 \u00b1 2.0 -1.4 0.58\nPotassium 12.7 \u00b1 0.9 11.7 \u00b1 0.9 -1.0 0.46\nSodium 17.8 \u00b1 1.5 14.6 \u00b1 1.3 -3.2 0.21\nThe main components that contributed to the decrease in DASH\ndiet accordance were total fat, fiber, and magnesium, as indicated\nby their high negative absolute changes.\nReferences & Links\n1.
