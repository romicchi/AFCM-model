It\nwas my version of the game \u201cI Spy,\u201d a popular game in the United States that encourages children to\nbe observant of, and learn to identify, objects, places, people, and things. My elementary\nschoolteacher taught me the game, and because I wanted to be \u201cjust like every American child,\u201d I\nplayed it every time I had the opportunity. At that time, I did not realize that I was categorizing the\nthings \u201cI spied\u201d into boxes:\nI spy a white person who goes to church.\nI spy a rich, white man going to work.\nI spy a black man running to catch the bus.\nI did not know about \u201clabels\u201d and \u201cstereotypes\u201d and how an innocent game of observation can\nbecome harmful in creating blind spots, yet be powerful in bringing to the surface one\u2019s assumptions\nand perceptions.\nAs an educator and consultant, I use this personal story in my classroom as an example when\ndiscussing core elements of identity, culture, diversity, and inclusion. Generally, the conversation\nstarts with a discussion of the physical differences of people and then moves into the invisible\ndifferences of culture: rules of engagement, a culture\u2019s relationship to nature, socially acceptable\nways of interacting, notions of justice, decision making, working styles, and more. More often than I\nwould like to admit, a large majority of time, conversations about cultural differences (whether in a\nclassroom or organizational setting) focus on physical differences and race and ethnicity as the core\nof culture. I have to remind managers and leaders that subcultures exist, as well as invisible things\nthey do not see, including individual beliefs and assumptions that contribute to the creation of\nculture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n2 It is hard for human beings not to categorize because labels help us relate to the world. Ruth\nHubbard,1 an American scientist, said that language helps us to categorize our feelings and thoughts.\nIn this way, we come to understand what is real in our world. These thoughts and feelings set the\ncontext for the ways in which we see the world. They frame our thinking and structure our behaviors.\nGeorge Lakoff2 wrote that every word in our thinking \u201cevokes a frame,\u201d which has been embedded in\nthe brain over long periods of time. Speaking or thinking about the words and images strengthens\nthe neural circuit and reinforces the frame. Although much of what we know and what we have\nlearned came from our early childhood, our thinking continues to be shaped through daily verbal and\nnonverbal communication and interactions. When we see something that disrupts our frame, our\nreaction is to protect ourselves and our ways of knowing\u2014anything we can do to reinforce our frame.\nThere have been numerous times when I have stood in line\u2014in a grocery store, a movie theater, a\nbank, or a retail store\u2014and the person before or after me becomes visibly upset when a person\n(usually from a different ethnic group) cuts into the line. \u201cThose people! Don\u2019t they know what a line\nis?\u201d Yet, in other situations, I hear, \u201cThat person just cut in line. Oh well.\u201d Depending on one\u2019s\nframe\u2014in this case, a cultural frame\u2014standing in a line may or may not be a cultural norm. Your\nresponse to the disruption (the image of someone cutting in line) reinforces your frame. You can\nreact with any of the following emotions: anger, surprise, disappointment, rage, or impatience.\nAlternatively, you may simply ignore it.\nCultural frameworks have a significant impact on how we express ourselves. I frequently tell\nmanagers and leaders that we need to learn how to shift our paradigms when working with cultural\ndifferences. When we shift, we not only see a different perspective, we are transformed in the\nprocess. Margaret Wheatley calls this system shift \u201cemergence,\u201d which she describes as \u201ca sudden\nappearance of a new insight, a new system, and a new capacity.\u201d3 The process is about \u201cstepping\noutside\u201d and \u201cstanding apart\u201d from our world views. When we emerge, we see our thought patterns\nand habits that form. In this process, we choose to let go of old, inactive learning. Consciously, we\nchoose to participate in continuously learning by adapting to the changing nature of our\nenvironments.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n3 Cultural intelligence (CI) principles help to facilitate awareness for, and understanding of, cultural\nframes. When applied, they bring our frameworks to a conscious level. At a level where we can see\nthe frames, we can then identify what it will take to learn new patterns of thought\u2014new ways to\nreframe. Reframing, according to Lakoff, \u201crequires a rewiring of the brain. That may take an\ninvestment of time, effort, and money.\u201d4 To be culturally intelligent is to reframe or rewire your\nbrain. You create new patterns and new frames by suspending your judgments and assumptions, by\nconsidering the old patterns in the face of the new or unfamiliar, and by choosing to change your\nbehavior and attitudes based on reflection and new interpretation. Cultural intelligence is the\nopenness to emergence, not just about the unfamiliar and new culture but about you\u2014who you are\nand who you could become.\nWhy This Book?\nPeter Drucker,5 the famous scholar of management, said that we are in an \u201cage of social transformation,\u201d a\nperiod of our lives where social order is drastically transforming the human condition and what it means\nfrom what we have previously known it to be. This age requires us to reflect differently than before about\nour relationships, about how we resolve intercultural and social conflicts, and the consequences our\nactions produce when we are not mindful of our intentions. Similarly, Daniel Pink,6 in A Whole New\nMind, speaks about a conceptual age where empathy and emotional intelligence are essential in business;\nwhere stories and storytelling are powerful tools to create unity, develop trust, and resolve unsettled\nbusiness; and how using play can help us find life\u2019s meaning and a deeper alignment to our core values.\nThe changes we see in societies around the globe necessitate a new and different paradigm for how we\ncome to think about culture. All this makes it harder and more challenging to think and practice cultural\ncompetence in the same way. Gardner7 says we need to approach the challenges that differences bring\nthrough acceptance, respect, and learning\u2014a frame that he calls the \u201crespectful mind.\u201d We must engage in\nintercultural situations and activities fully; we need to immerse ourselves and experience the \u201cflow\u201d8 in\norder to harness the emotions needed to perform and learn from our cultural interactions. Leaders must\nbe willing to explore and create new ways of thinking and interacting with the flow of culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n4 In this age of social transformation, cultural intelligence is a topic of urgency for organizational leaders. I\nhear it from leaders and managers, and I see it in everyday organizational life. Environmental, political,\nand technological factors are quickly shifting the ways we work and interrelate with one another. Culture\nshifts are happening at a faster rate than organizations are ready for and capable of managing, thus\ncreating mental and emotional havoc in managing and leading through cultural transitions. In many\ncases, the result is a tighter hold on the invisible aspects of culture and stronger emphasis for \u201cthe \u2018right\u2019\nway to do the work.\u201d\nMore and more, people ask for the tools and information that help carry them through intercultural and\ncross-cultural interactions. There are a multitude of tools and methodologies that are useful for managing\nand leading on a global level\u2014the cultural intelligence framework is one of them. It is only one component\nin the equation for improving the management and leadership of cultural interactions. I tell leaders, \u201cYou\nneed to recognize that no matter what tool or method you use, who you are and how you use the tool or\nmethod is the biggest part of the equation.\u201d\nThe information in this book is designed to help you understand a piece of that equation. The ideas\nbehind cultural intelligence help you to grasp the important impact of cultural interactions while assisting\nin your practice as a culturally intelligent leader. Even if you have worked with cultural intelligence or\nother intercultural communication tools and principles, this book serves as a tool to further develop your\nproficiency.\nWho Is This Book For?\nThis book is written for leaders who want to learn about cultural intelligence and its application to\nleadership. Leaders emerge from all walks of life, in formal and informal ways, and notions of leadership\ndiffer among cultures. This book uses the definition of leadership from the GLOBE study of leadership\nacross cultures: the ability of an individual to influence, motivate, and enable others to contribute\ntoward the effectiveness and success of the organizations which they are members.9 People who engage\nin this process are called leaders.\nThe model of cultural intelligence is a research-based model that I have used in my consulting and\neducation work with executives, leaders, administrators, boards of directors, students, volunteers,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n5 parents, and more. Whether you are in government or in a nonprofit or private sector business, the\ncultural intelligence framework is practical enough to help you create organizational growth and change.\nThe model speaks to a diverse audience base, and its theoretical foundations, are useful to those who want\nto learn more about the scientific elements of culture.\nReading the Book\nThis book outlines the importance of understanding culture and its impact on our lives, the strategic value\nof cultural intelligence, and the significance of integrating and practicing cultural intelligence in everyday\nlife. The book is designed to help you overcome the challenges in intercultural interactions by focusing on\ncultural intelligence in leadership and management.\nThis book does not focus on specific cultural etiquettes or how to do business in other countries. It is a\nbook designed to help you apply cultural intelligence to any cultural situation. This is not an academic\ntextbook, although the concepts presented here are essential to your knowledge about culture and\nintercultural interactions.\nThe eight chapters in this book consist of reflection exercises and case studies that can be used as a guide\nto your continued learning and development in cultural intelligence. Each chapter begins with a personal\nstory, quote, or idea about culture and intercultural work and ends with a summary of the key concepts.\nTo continue your work in cultural intelligence, there is a website (http://www.cileadership.com) that has\nbeen set up to provide you with more sample case studies and inventories.\n\uf0b7 The Introduction provides an overview to the topic of cultural intelligence. It examines\nglobalization and its significance for culturally intelligent leadership.\n\uf0b7 Chapter 1 \"Culturally Intelligent Leadership Matters\" explores the literature on culture and\nleadership. It examines several studies that illustrate the importance of understanding culture in\nleadership and management.\n\uf0b7 Chapter 2 \"Understanding Culture\" examines the concept of culture. The chapter focuses on\nrecognizing the different levels of culture and how culture is shared and learned. It also highlights\nthe significance of cultural value dimensions in intercultural work.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n6 \uf0b7 Chapter 3 \"Cultural Intelligence Defined\" focuses on what cultural intelligence is and what it\nconsists of. It describes how cultural intelligence is different from other forms of intelligences.\n\uf0b7 Chapter 4 \"Thinking About Thinking\" delves into the first component of cultural intelligence:\ncultural strategic thinking. It focuses on the topics of cognition and metacognition. Techniques\nand tools to practice and improve metacognition are offered.\n\uf0b7 Chapter 5 \"I Think I Can and I Will\" moves into a discussion of motivation and mindfulness, the\nsecond part to cultural intelligence. The chapter centers on the role of self-efficacy in culture and\nthe value mindfulness has in intercultural interactions.\n\uf0b7 Chapter 6 \"Adapting and Performing\" focuses on the third component of cultural intelligence:\nbehavior. It focuses on the notion of self-concept and how this impacts behavior and attitudes.\nAdditionally, this section examines the impact of behavioral communication.\n\uf0b7 Chapter 7 \"Cultural Intelligence in Action\" consists of 10 case studies that illustrate different\ncultural situations. It provides you with the opportunity to practice the cultural intelligence\nprinciples.\n\uf0b7 Chapter 8 \"The Future of Cultural Intelligence\" looks into the future and examines what is\nneeded for cultural intelligence principles to thrive. It also discusses the types of leadership\nneeded to bring more attention to cultural intelligence.\nYou can read this book in the following ways:\n\uf0b7 Begin at the beginning. If you would like to understand cultural intelligence and its relationship to\nculture in depth, I recommend starting at the beginning and reading the book sequentially. The book\nis written as if you were taking a workshop in cultural intelligence; it begins with a basic foundation to\nculture before delving into principles of cultural intelligence.\n\uf0b7 Read individual chapters. Cultural intelligence principles overlap with each other. In this book, each\ncultural intelligence principle is discussed separately in its own chapter so you can choose which\nchapter to focus on. But each chapter is written in a way to help you connect that principle to other\nprinciples of cultural intelligence.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n7 \uf0b7 Read case studies and work on inventories. If you would like to use cultural intelligence as a training\ntool, you can visit the websitehttp://www.cileadership.com for a list of inventories and updated case\nstudies.\nDefinitions and Terminology\nThroughout the book, the following terms will be used. Sometimes they are used interchangeably,\nsometimes alone, and sometimes together. Additionally, this book makes a clear distinction between\nmanagement and leadership and managers and leaders, a difference that is outlined in Chapter 1\n\"Culturally Intelligent Leadership Matters\".\n\uf0b7 Culture: shared beliefs, values, and assumptions of a group of people who learn from one another and\nteach to others that their behaviors, attitudes, and perspectives are the correct ways to think, act, and\nfeel.10\n\uf0b7 Cross-Cultural: involving two or more cultures\n\uf0b7 Diversity: distinct and unlike elements or qualities (interests, people, ideas, perspectives, ability,\nregion, etc.); can be visible and invisible\n\uf0b7 Intercultural: between or among people of different cultures\n\uf0b7 Intracultural: within the same culture\n\uf0b7 Multicultural: many or several cultures\n\uf0b7 Intercultural competence: ability to successfully interact with people of different cultural backgrounds\nWe are living in exciting times that call for courageous and authentic leadership in leading through\nblurred boundaries. The changes we see are opportunities for growth and development as individuals,\norganizations, and communities. We have an opportunity to identify and clarify our interpretation of the\nworld through our relationships with one another. We can seize the chance to identify our blind spots and\nto uncover the stories we tell about ourselves and why we can or cannot interact with others. We have the\npotential to explore our work around cultures in a way that uncovers the hidden routines and habitual\nbehaviors that contribute negatively to human relationships.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n8 Endnotes\n1.

In the past 20 years, Minnesota, much like the rest of the United States,\nhas reflected a global community. Refugees and immigrants are coming from all over the world\u2014\nWest and East Africa, Southeast Asia, Russia and Bosnia, Central and South America, and the Middle\nEast\u2014and contributing to the economic system.\nI noticed this change when I returned to Minnesota after my studies. I remember dropping my\nsiblings off at their high school and saw for the first time a group of high school girls wearing\nthe hijab, a head covering and the jilbab, the dress coat. I could not take my eyes off them. I had read\nbooks and magazine articles and seen pictures of women with the hijab on the evening news. I was\nused to seeing these images, yet I was completely transfixed with the actual experience of seeing the\npictures come to life only 100 feet away from me. I wondered, what was their story? How did they\ncome to the United States? Did they like wearing the hijab? Was it a choice?\nSoon after this experience I became more aware of the East African population in the Twin Cities. I\nnoticed them when I was standing in line at the grocery store, the library, and the bank. I began to\nhear stories on the evening news about the resettlement challenges they faced as new immigrants,\nwhich reminded me of my own. Eventually, I worked alongside them and learned about their cultural\nhistory and life in the U.S. Through these intercultural experiences, I learned in my early 20s that\nalthough culture can shape people to have different beliefs and values, different language and\ncustoms, the globalization of societies was quickly forcing us to work and live together in ways we\nhad not done before. It is making us more aware of who we are, our differences, and how we relate to\nothers.\nIn The World is Flat, Thomas Friedman1 describes forces that are flattening the world and creating a\nconvergence of many systems into one. These forces include the spread of information technology,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n10 online collaborative communities, and offshoring and outsourcing, among others. These factors are\nchanging our social environment and redefining the ways in which we interact with one another. We\ndo not need to fly across the globe to experience national cultural shifts\u2014they come to us, no matter\nwhere we live. This is a familiar picture across the United States, but it is not unique to U.S. citizens.\nEven in countries like India and China, which are experiencing phenomenal economic growth,\nglobalization has altered their lifestyles. As an example, my colleague in China gets up either very\nearly or stays up very late into the night for her business meetings with clients in the United States.\nOwning a business and working globally has limited her social life to business events and\nnetworking. She hardly has time for her family and she feels guilty that she is not the traditional\nChinese daughter and mother.\nMy colleague, like many others around the world doing business globally, is learning to cope with\ncultural shifts. A few years ago I attended a leadership conference where I met Betsy, who had lived\nand worked in the Midwest for all her life. At that time she worked for a U.S. company and was part\nof a management team supervising a customer service division in Bangalore. As we talked about the\nchallenges of working in a multicultural, global team, Betsy shared with me that her employees in\nIndia were fascinated with Americans, especially that they wanted to learn how to speak more\n\u201cAmerican\u201d. I asked her what she meant about \u201cspeaking more American\u201d and she replied,\n\u201cThey want to know American slang and how we pronounce words. They are motivated to want to\nlearn to speak better English without an accent.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it important for them to speak without an accent?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt helps the customers.\u201d She said. Betsy explained further, \u201cCustomers in the U.S. feel better if they\nspeak to someone who doesn\u2019t have an accent. They feel like they\u2019re speaking to someone right here\nin the U.S. instead of thousands of miles away in a different part of the world.\u201d\nHer comment made me ask, \u201cDo you think that they could do their job well even with an accent?\u201d\nBetsy\u2019s response was, \u201cOf course! It\u2019s just that it\u2019s easier if the customer can understand. It\u2019s also true\nfor our team members here in the U.S. They get frustrated when they don\u2019t understand their Indian\ncoworker. For some people the accent really is a distraction. They just give up.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n11 Then I said to her, \u201cIf you have a problem understanding them, don\u2019t you think that your Indian\nwork force in India also has problems understanding the way you talk? It seems to me that your staff\nin India is really motivated to adapt, and I wonder if you think your team here in the U.S. can be just\nas adaptable?\u201d\nBetsy pondered that for a moment, and then said, \u201cSure. It\u2019s easy to say that we can be adaptable but\nactually doing it is very hard.\u201d\nI replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s hard for everyone.\u201d\nI walked away from that conversation thinking that global changes will only increase, especially in\ncountries like China and India, and that Betsy and her team would be better equipped for the future\nif they could learn to be more adaptable. James Canton, a social scientist and global futurist, predicts\nthat global changes will create an \u201cinnovation economy.\u201d He wrote, \u201cAlready, every economy\u2014local,\nregional, national, or global\u2014is deeply affected by innovation. Those effects will multiply a thousand\nfold over the next fifty years.\u201d2 This innovation economy includes the following characteristics and\ntrends:\n\uf0b7 Development of new manufacturing processes to enable faster, on-demand production\n\uf0b7 New communication systems that connect people to information in real time\n\uf0b7 Creation of information services that are translatable into software, games, and programs that provide\ngreater customer value to consumers and businesses\n\uf0b7 Development of materials that are smarter, safer, and cleaner to make into products\n\uf0b7 A focus on developing renewable, clean, and affordable fuels\n\uf0b7 Discovery of new methods to increase ability of individuals and companies to be more mobile and\nreach more customers3\nThese changes demand that organizations create new skill sets and knowledge; it requires leaders\nand organizations to create work environments that support the new innovation economy. The\ntrends in the innovation economy, like any system, have an effect on global demographic changes.\nThe following are factors that will shape the work force:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n12 \uf0b7 Hispanics and women will dominate the U.S. work force.\n\uf0b7 Women will comprise a high percentage of new workers and leaders.\n\uf0b7 Increased immigration will be necessary to enable available talent to keep up with the demands of\nbusiness and society.\n\uf0b7 The future work force will not be defined by geography; rather, it will be defined by talent.\n\uf0b7 The aging population in America and Europe will have dramatic effects on society and the economy.\n\uf0b7 Innovation will be a key driver of work force skills, requiring an overhaul of the education system.4\nThe next list consists of statistics that point to additional changes in the global economy; these are\nexpediting the need for intercultural understanding and awareness:\n\uf0b7 The United States exported US$1.57 trillion in goods and services in 2009.5\n\uf0b7 Hispanics or Latinos, blacks or African Americans, and Asians continue to increase their share of the\nlabor force6 and are projected to be faster than their white counterparts.\n\uf0b7 Between 1992 and 2012, the increase in the labor force for African American women will be 39.6%, for\nAsian Americans, 75.7%, and for Latina Americans, 109.8%.7\n\uf0b7 Factors impacting the composition and growth of the labor force over the next 50 years will include\nthe baby-boomer generation, the stabilization of the women\u2019s labor force, and increasing racial and\nethnic diversity in the work force.8\n\uf0b7 Increased immigration rates will further diversify the U.S. population and labor force.9\n\uf0b7 The 2010 U.S. Census estimates that the \u201cnation\u2019s minority population is steadily rising and now\nmakes up 35 percent of the United States, advancing an unmistakable trend that could make\nminorities the new American majority by mid-century.\u201d10\nAll of this information, along with international migration, the restructuring of jobs and\norganizations, and international market expansion means that \u201cas economic borders come down,\ncultural barriers go up presenting new challenges and opportunities in business; when cultures come\ninto contact, they may converge on some aspects, but their idiosyncrasies will likely amplify.\u201d11 Take\nfor example the following:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n13 Joan is the president of a Chamber of Commerce located in the Midwest. As part of their on-going\nwork, they need to partner with local businesses to discuss a multi-million dollar commercial\nrevitalization project proposed by the city. Many of the local business owners in the district are\nHispanic, and their business would be severely affected by the changes. Joan\u2019s association has\npartnered in the past with some of the businesses for association events, but not a lot of\ncollaboration has occurred between the Chamber and the Hispanic business owners. It\u2019s essential\nthat the Chamber meet and discuss potential barriers to the project with the Hispanic\ncommunity.\nJoan identifies specific Hispanic business owners to partner with in hopes that they would help\nbring in other members of their community. Early in the partnership Joan encounters problems.\nIt takes her several times to secure a meeting with four business owners in the district. When the\nfirst meeting is scheduled, two of the three were late and one never showed up.\nBecause the meeting started late, Joan quickly facilitates introductions, and then moves on to\ndiscussing the proposed changes from the city and the impact it could have on business owners.\nShe moves quickly through the agenda items, helping the group to stay on task and focused on the\npurpose of the meeting. In the end, the group decides to meet again to discuss the proposal. When\nit comes time again for their second meeting, no one shows up.\nFor Joan, time is running out. The city wants to hear how the Chamber will help the Hispanic\nbusiness owners with the new proposal. After several attempts to connect with the business\nowners, Joan finds out from other sources that the business owners do not trust the Chamber. The\nowners do not feel the Chamber knows what is important to the Hispanic community. Joan is\nsurprised. The purpose for the first meeting was to establish trust and to build a relationship with\nthe community, which she thought they did. Joan doesn\u2019t understand how a meeting could set off\na chain of reactions like this.\nBoth Joan and the Hispanic business owners come to a meeting to discuss a commercial\nrevitalization project. Although having a meeting to discuss business is standard in both cultures,\nhow a meeting is conducted, what is discussed, and who talks first at a meeting are all idiosyncrasies\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n14 of culture. Because Joan is not aware of the cultural idiosyncrasies, it is hard for her to understand\nand correct the situation. Even if she did not know the specific cultural facts of how to conduct and\ninteract in meetings with Hispanic business owners, she could still adapt to the situation by being\npresent in the moment and noticing the verbal and nonverbal cues of her colleagues. All this points\nto the need for leaders to be culturally intelligent when working with one another, whether it is on a\nlocal, regional, national, or international level.\nLeaders cannot afford to make mistakes in business due to cultural differences. Joan\u2019s mistake was\nbeing unaware of the cultural differences between herself and her Hispanic colleagues. This lack of\nawareness and understanding led her to behave in a way that was culturally inappropriate, leading to\nconsequences that would impact her organization. Even with Betsy and her multicultural team,\ncultural barriers such as language can play a large role in the success or failure of her global team.\nThe recognition of cultural challenges is essential even when a group appears to be homogenous.\nPaying attention to the idiosyncrasies will likely enable a leader to make different choices that\ncontribute to the effectiveness of a team and organization. Not considering cultural differences can\nlead to the loss of sales and contracts, damaged reputations, and broken partnerships, as in the\nexample of Joan and the Chamber of Commerce. These are just some of the consequences of\nintercultural misunderstandings.\nWorking in a global community means that leaders must learn to overcome cultural differences in\nthe following ways:\n1. Understand cultural differences and their manifestations. Throughout the course of my\nwork in diversity and leadership, I meet leaders who encounter challenges, big and small, related to\ncultural differences. The ones I found to effectively lead through the differences were those who took\nthe initiative to understand differences and how they played out among individuals, team members,\nand organizations. For example, John, the chief of police for a city in Alabama, told me that one thing\nhe helps his employees to understand is the pervasiveness of culture. He constantly reminds them\nthat a person\u2019s individual culture can impact the entire culture of a team and organization. He said,\n\u201cWhat happens to a person one day can change that person\u2019s perspective and belief. If this person\ncomes into this organization and interacts with their peers and this person is in a leadership position,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n15 you better believe that the rest of his peers will begin to believe what he believes. That\u2019s my challenge.\nEvery day I tell my directors they need to lead through the challenges.\u201d\n2. Be able to transfer cultural knowledge from one culture to another. I found that culturally\nintelligent leaders are those that take the time to know about a culture. They look for opportunities to\nlearn about the cultural facts, the music, the history, the language, and the behaviors of people within\nthe culture. They tell others about what they have learned, thus helping them to remember the\ninformation and verbalize their experiences. Most importantly, they use the information gained to\nhelp them understand themselves and their own cultural upbringing. By doing this, they are able to\nadapt from one culture to another.\n3. Recognize their biases, assumptions, and cultural frameworks. When leaders are able to\nidentify and recognize their cultural biases and assumptions, it helps them to let go of preconceived\nideas. The ability to do this helps leaders to identify the elements of their thinking that get in the way\nof culturally intelligent behaviors. I learned that culturally intelligent leaders take the time to reflect\non their biases and assumptions; they use mistakes and failures as opportunities to improve. I once\nconsulted with a senior director who told me that the more she practiced thinking about her thinking,\nthe more it enabled her to learn about herself and her reactions to situations.\n4. Be motivated and committed to working through cultural conflicts. Intercultural conflicts\nare extremely challenging but not impossible to work through. The times I found success in conflict\nresolution among team members or a manager and employee were when both parties were willing\nand motivated to discuss the conflict, even when it seemed that the process was at a standstill. As an\nexample, I worked with a director and her employee to help them understand each other\u2019s working\nstyle to enable them to work better together. At the end of an emotionally charged session the director\ncommitted herself to continuing the dialogue. Additionally, she committed resources to help both of\nthem learn more about each other. The director\u2019s expression of her commitment modeled the way for\nthe employee to do the same.\n5. Be willing to adapt and learn to live and work with different cultures. I am always amazed\nat the ability of human and organizational systems to be adaptive and resilient. A leader\u2019s positive\nattitude toward change and flexibility propels him or her further along the cultural intelligence\ncontinuum than a negative one. For example, when I worked with Susan and Megan, both directors\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n16 looking for my help to implement diversity workshops, I noticed that Susan always had a positive\napproach to thinking about culture, and it showed up in the words she used. She would say, \u201cI\u2019m\noptimistic\u201d or \u201cIt will be a challenge but I know that we can make this work.\u201d Whereas\nMegan seemed optimistic about the work, but you could hear seeds of doubt in her words. She would\nsay, \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge and I am not sure how we can make it work.\u201d At one point Susan was quite\nfrustrated and told Megan that if they did not try to make a change, they would remain in the\nsituation with the same problems. What turned Megan around was her willingness to move toward\nadaptation; her attitude changed and as a result, both directors became models of working with\nchange.\nIn an innovation economy, leaders will need to be culturally intelligent. The demographic changes of\nsocieties, including the make-up of the work force, require leaders to gain new skills and knowledge\nthat help them to maintain an ideology of change and adaptation. To be competent in global cultures\nis no longer the norm; it is a requirement for leaders to cultivate their competence into cultural\nintelligence. It is more than competence, which is having the abilities to function or develop in\nspecific ways. It is about knowing how to use the abilities and making sense of them in cultural\nsituations. CI can be used to help leaders work through intercultural dilemmas and create\nunderstanding and awareness across and between cultures. In the new innovation economy, leaders\nmust be familiar with the basic principles of intercultural interaction and communication, and they\nmust be able to teach and pass on this knowledge to those they lead. In this way, leaders embrace\nand perform cultural intelligence in their daily lives.\nChapter Summary\n\uf0b7 Globalization is flattening the world and has created changes to our social and political environments.\n\uf0b7 Lifestyle changes are happening all around the world.\n\uf0b7 Technological changes are creating an \u201cinnovation economy\u201d that will require new skill sets and\nknowledge, and new organizational structures.\n\uf0b7 Demographic changes in the work force are affecting intercultural work.

When I finally found a parking space, I\nhurriedly picked up the large box in the back of my car that held my training materials. By the time I\nreached the conference room, I was tired and sweaty from walking in my 3-inch-high-heeled pumps.\nThe coordinator was anxiously awaiting my arrival. Even though I profusely apologized for being\nlate, she gave me \u201ca look\u201d that said, \u201chow unprofessional.\u201d\nAs I entered the room, all eyes were on me, of course. Everyone was on time, and I, as the trainer,\nshould have been there before the first person entered the room. Any reason I provided would have\nbeen a terrible excuse for this particular crowd, made up of professionals dressed in their business\nsuits, with pens and paper in hand, ready to learn. They paid a lot of money for the conference, of\nwhich I was teaching only one half-day session.\nWhat went through my mind as I set up my materials, quickly handing them out to the\nparticipants? I messed up. Wow, this is really bad and unprofessional. They are not bringing me back,\nfor sure. Those people in the corner look mad. At least that woman over there seems sympathetic\u2014or\nwas that a facial twitch?\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you for coming. I see you\u2019re all early. And now that we\u2019ve had the\nchance to get to know each other, let\u2019s begin the training.\u201d You can imagine the facial expressions I\nreceived from the audience: confusion, disbelief, bewilderment.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n19 \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Is there something wrong with what I said? Let me explain. You all arrived here on\ntime, as Americans generally would. I also arrived here on time, as a Hmong person would. You just\nhappened to be on American time, and I\u2019m following Hmong time. You might think I\u2019m late, but in\nHmong time, I\u2019m actually quite early.\u201d That broke the ice for the group, and I decided to use the\nexperience to lead into the session about cultural intelligence.\n\u201cSince all of you were here really early, I\u2019m sure you had the chance to introduce yourselves; find out\nabout each others\u2019 families, where you\u2019re from, who you\u2019re related to, right? No? Well, that\u2019s not\nright. We can\u2019t start the training if you haven\u2019t had the chance to relax and just learn about each\nother. We better do that or else we\u2019re going to face some problems later.\u201d\nThe experience was the perfect opportunity to share and discuss the challenges involved in\nnavigating cultural terrains. Turning my personal experience into a \u201cteaching moment\u201d gave the\naudience the chance to pause and reflect about the differences in cultural expression and behavior.\nThe example was used to help the participants dig deeper and to draw out their Western, cultural\nassumptions. They learned to ask questions like the following:\n\uf0b7 What are the differences in time between her culture and mine?\n\uf0b7 How do Hmong people approach meetings and trainings?\n\uf0b7 Is this behavior specific to the trainer, as an individual, regardless of her national culture?\n\uf0b7 Is this behavior specific to her family and how she was raised?\n\uf0b7 Why do I care if she was \u201clate\u201d?\n\uf0b7 Can I let go of my emotional attachment for her be here \u201con time\u201d?\n\uf0b7 What am I not seeing in this situation?\n\uf0b7 What is my motivation for resolving this situation?\n\uf0b7 How am I behaving? Do I need to change my behavior? If so, what can I do?\nWhy are these questions important to ask? Asking the questions that move you away from immediate\nreaction to positive action and reflection is necessary in cultural intelligence work. It enables you to\nhave an awareness of the idiosyncrasies of culture, the peculiarities of its effects, and the role it plays\nin our lives. When you are able to accomplish this, you create a new awareness of your\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n20 surroundings\u2014you create a new picture of the situation. The practice of creating new awareness and\nunderstanding is your ability to be adaptable and flexible.\nIn the Tao te Ching, an ancient Chinese manuscript written by Lao Tzu and translated by Stephen\nMitchell, [1] Lao Tzu explains how one can live their life in perfect harmony with conflicting forces. He\nwrites throughout the book about the importance of a person\u2019s ability to be flexible and adaptable. At\nbirth, he says, we are all malleable. As we grow older, knowledge that we gain from our social and\ncultural environments often leads us to become rigid and blocked. Lao Tzu says that flexibility is\nessential to growth and evolution, and that we need to choose adaptability over rigidity for survival.\nIn a world where organizations must be change-focused, adaptable, and flexible in their intercultural\nwork, leaders are being asked to help people work through, and come to terms with, the changes that\ndifferences often bring. Organizations and leaders that expect change are those that tend to thrive\u2014\nthey anticipate and envision different scenarios of environmental change, both internally and\nexternally. [2] Leaders who are bound to a single viewpoint or perspective are no longer effective when\nleading because the perspectives narrow the opportunities for sustainable organizational growth.\nWhen leaders are change focused and embrace an adaptability mindset, they can be better informed,\nmake the right decisions, and provide the right resources to motivate their employees to succeed and\nperform at their best levels.\n[1] Mitchell (1988).\n[2] Lawler & Worley (2006).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n21 1.1 The Difference between Managers and Leaders\nWarren Bennis famously wrote in his book On Becoming a Leader that a manager does things right\nand leaders do the right thing. [1] Like other leadership scholars, Bennis makes a clear distinction\nbetween leadership and management and between managers and leaders. A manager\u2019s behavior and\nactivities focus on controlling, planning, coordinating, and organizing. This differs from a leader,\nwhose behaviors and tasks focus on innovation, vision, motivation, trust, and change. [2]\nTable 1.1 Difference Between Management and Leadership.\nManagers Leaders\nCope with complexity by\u2026 Cope with change by\u2026\nplanning for goals setting direction\nbudgeting for goals developing a future\nestablishing agendas and tasks having a strategic vision for change\norganizing roles and responsibilities aligning of people\nstructuring staff and jobs communicating direction\ndelegating people creating coalitions\nmonitoring and implementing results being commitment focused\nidentifying deviations motivating and inspiring\nplanning and organizing to solve problems leveraging human value and potential\nNote. Adapted from Kotter, What Leaders Really Do (1999). Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business Review.\nCultural intelligence requires leadership, not management. It calls for what Ronald Heifetz [3] defines\nas courageous leadership, that is, the courage to see reality and help others see their realities: the\nrealities of who they are, how they behave, what talents and skill sets they have or are missing in this\nglobal world, and what opportunities should be capitalized upon and seized. Leaders must be able to\nsee and anticipate what skill sets are needed in the future, not just develop their employees\u2019 skills for\nthe moment. [4]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n22 Culturally intelligent leaders must create an environment where diversity and culture flourish, and\nwhere conflicting values can be safely expressed and explored through dialogue. Barry Salzberg, CEO\nof Deloitte, says that organizations and leaders must ask themselves the hard questions: Does our\ncorporate culture really accept the differences it invites, and do we really embrace the different\nperspectives that come from increasing our commitment to recruiting? [5] This type of perspective\ndemands leaders who work toward transformation, or what Couto calls citizen leaders, \u201ctransforming\nleaders who engage others in efforts to reach higher levels of human awareness and relationships.\u201d [6]\n[1] Bennis (1985).\n[2] Bennis (1985).\n[3] Taylor (1999).\n[4] Goldsmith (2006).\n[5] Salzberg (2008), p. 123.\n[6] Couto (1995).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n23 1.2 Importance of Leadership in a Global Economy\nOver the years, leadership scholars have found in their studies that, when talking about the\nleadership process, culture matters. [1] In general, the leadership literature points to the critical need\nfor cross-cultural and global leadership, especially given the pressing need to build networks and\nrelationships [2] and to create an appreciation for differences and similarities. Bennis noted that,\nalthough leadership competencies have remained the same, it is \u201cour understanding of what it is and\nhow it works and the ways in which people learn to apply it has shifted.\u201d [3]\nLeadership theories and models available thus far, while helpful in understanding leadership\ndevelopment, are inadequate paradigms for a full understanding of the changing nature of leadership\nin the 21st century. Goldsmith et al. [4] argued for new forms of leadership that include thinking\nglobally, appreciating cultural diversity, developing technological savvy, building partnerships and\nalliances, and sharing leadership. Research intocross-cultural leadership revealed that understanding\nnational cultures is critical to leadership development and that organizations must accept differing\nperceptions of leadership. [5]\nLeadership theories and programs that operate from a Western-based,\nandrocentric framework hinder the shift that is required for understanding leadership on a broader\nlevel. Situational leadership theories, [6] which focus on leadership traits, skills, and styles, are\ninadequate models in this regard because their basic foundation (understanding the individual as\nleader) implies a Western-based ideology of leadership that does not exist in many national cultures;\ntherefore, the underlying concepts of this style of leadership do not always translate universally.\nOther theories, such as transformational and team leadership, emphasize the collective voice as\nessential yet neglect the cultural implications for leadership. Even cultures that share similar\nWestern beliefs about organizational structure still operate differently based on their unique cultural\ncontexts. [7]\nIn a global economy, it is becoming increasingly more important to understand the wants and needs\nof those we serve, that is, the internal and external stakeholders. Having awareness of this need\nmeans that leaders must be able to shape the culture of their organizations to address changing\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n24 stakeholder needs. Edgar Schein noted that leaders can do this by having a \u201cpersonal sense that they\nare the creation of the cultures of the countries, families, occupations, and reference groups, and that\nculture plays a huge role in the capacities of their organization to form.\u201d [8] Culturally intelligent\nleaders need be strategic in aligning the culture of their organizations with the people who work in\nthem. This organizational culture becomes an advantage for leaders, making it easier for them to\nrespond to external environmental factors, which include culture shifts.\nDebbe Kennedy [9] proposed the following five qualities that leaders need in order to address and use\ncultural differences to the advantage of their organization:\n\uf0b7 Leaders must make diversity a priority.\n\uf0b7 Leaders must get to know people and their differences.\n\uf0b7 Leaders must enable rich communication.\n\uf0b7 Leaders must make accountability a core value.\n\uf0b7 Leaders must be able to establish mutualism as the final arbiter.\nThese five characteristics I have seen as important differences between the ways that managers and\nleaders handle cultural conflicts and situations. Culturally intelligent leaders are those that elevate\ndiversity to the top of organizational planning and view it as a critical factor to innovation and\ncreativity. Innovation in diversity begins with a definition of diversity, which many organizations\nlack or have poorly articulated. If they do, diversity definitions are focused on race and ethnicity and\ndo not explore the dynamic dimensions implicit in culture. In a 2007 study on diversity in the\nworkplace, the Society of Human Resource Management [10] reported that only 30% of organizations\nhave a shared definition of diversity in the workplace. However, 75% feel that diversity can be used to\nimprove work and relationships. A focus for, and an articulation of, defining diversity and its\nimportance in the work force can open dialogue for organizations.\nHaving culturally intelligent leaders in organizations matter because they help to develop a curiosity\nfor differences in the workplace in employees. They help to provide access to information and\nintentionally gather cultural knowledge on a daily basis that will help them and others learn more\nabout differences and the influence of differences in the workplace. Additionally, leaders can foster\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n25 creativity and curiosity when they set aside some time, on a day-to-day basis, to practice and master\ntheir cultural intelligence skills.\nWhen I have seen culturally intelligent leaders in action, they cultivate an environment of trust,\nwhich is critical when working with differences in the workplace. Patrick Lencioni [11] wrote that trust\nis a critical foundational element in interpersonal relationships. Leaders must be willing to be\nvulnerable in intercultural interactions, openly admitting what they know and don\u2019t know about\nculture and cultural differences. They must be able to admit that they might not be able to resolve\nintercultural differences. By demonstrating vulnerability, a leader enables richer communication and\ncreates an inviting space and environment for intercultural dialogue. In this situation, people are\nmore willing to ask for help and to provide one another with constructive feedback; they take risks\nand learn to appreciate the differences in skills and style that each person brings to the work\nenvironment.\nFor diversity and culture to flourish in organizations, everyone in the workplace must hold each\nother accountable toward differences. My experiences working with leaders of different sectors, both\nformal and informal, have shown me that the creation of a mission and vision for diversity can only\ntake an organization so far. Culturally Intelligent leaders create standards of accountability,\nexplaining what is expected of each employee and of themselves in intercultural interactions.\nAs an example, I was brought in to facilitate a workshop about cultural differences for public sector\nemployees. In this workshop, the city manager and a city council member were present; they wanted\nto demonstrate to their employees the importance of culture and their commitment to diversity in\nthe city. At the end of the session, they stood up and addressed the participants, reminding them that\nthe workshop they participated in was only one of many to come. Moreover, the city manager and\ncity council member told the employees that they would do whatever it took to ensure that everyone\nwas held accountable for delivering culturally relevant services to the department\u2019s clients. In this\nway, \u201cPutting differences to work is greatly enhanced when personal responsibility is a common\nthread woven tightly into everyone\u2019s fabric.\u201d [12]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n26 When everyone is held accountable for their choices and behaviors in an intercultural workplace,\nthere is a higher level of respect and trust among workers. Everyone is encouraged to perform his or\nher best and to hold themselves to the highest standards in working with each other. Intercultural\nconflicts still occur, but the responses to these conflicts from individuals are different.\nLee Bolman and Terrence Deal [13] wrote that organizations are a coalition of individuals and groups\nwith different interests, preferences, and beliefs. The differences among individuals and groups can\nchange, but this usually occurs very slowly. Leaders must be able to identify mutual interests, values,\nand beliefs in order to create a culture of mutual interdependence. Because conflict is unavoidable,\nand often necessary, it is best for leaders to create a picture of mutual dependence that is both\nbeneficial and progressive for employees.\nLeadership matters even more when cultures are intertwined in the workplace. Leadership and\nculture are like two pieces of rope. On their own, they can be used to bundle objects, connect one\nthing to another, and even support weight. When threaded and intertwined, they do all of these\nthings but are much stronger and have less chances of being snapped. A rope is firm and strong yet\nflexible and pliable. Because change is constant, leaders can use their cultural intelligence to steer\norganizations, and those they lead, toward finding innovative strategies and solutions to intercultural\nissues.\nLike an anthropologist, culturally intelligent leaders explore, discover, and find cultural artifacts in\ntheir business environment that are both barriers to, and promoters of, growth. A culturally\nintelligent leader will accomplish this from an \u201coutsider\u201d perspective while keeping his or her\n\u201cinsider\u201d perspective in line. Ronald Heifetz [14] says that one should take a leap to get a balcony\nperspective when one has been on the dance floor too long; this enables one to see a bigger picture of\nwhat is really going on in the intercultural business workplace. Reminding yourself that what you see\nis only one perspective of a bigger picture can help you to pay attention to what you did not notice or\nwhat you cannot see. Cultural intelligence requires leaders to take a critical role in guiding different\nvalues in order to bring them into alignment with the business. However, leaders need not do this\nalone; in fact, they should invite and encourage members to assist in addressing diversity and then\nchallenge them to be culturally intelligent as well.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n27 [1] Koopman, Hartog, & Konrad (1999).\n[2] Goldsmith, Greenberg, Robertson, & Hu-Chan (2003).\n[3] Bennis (1985), p. 3.\n[4] Goldsmith et al.

At times, leaders\nmust be able to step away from what they are experiencing to understand the full impact of culture on\nleadership.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n29 Chapter 2\nUnderstanding Culture\nWhen my parents came to the United States in 1979, their world became vastly different than what\nthey had known. Before their arrival, they lived in a small hilltop, tribal village in the mountains of\nLaos, like many of their ancestors before them. They had the simplest tools for doing their work and\nfor living their lives. The natural world provided everything they needed. If they wanted to use the\nbathroom, they went outside\u2014not to an outhouse but to the woods. When they were hungry, they\ncooked the meal in a pot over a large fire pit. When relatives asked them to attend celebrations and\nnotified them that the celebration meal would begin sometime when the sun was to set, my parents\nknew that the path of the sun would let them know when they should leave their house.\nThere were a lot of assumptions my parents made about their world. When they had to relocate to\nthe United States, they found out how different their assumptions were when they were tested in an\nenvironment that contradicted their ways of being. They were not aware of a different way of living\ntheir lives, because the norms that shaped their lives influenced their actions and behaviors. The\nnorms helped them to learn that what they did was the correct way to live.\nOne of their most difficult challenges was to unlearn what they knew in a different context and with\ndifferent materials and tools that they did not have before. What naturally occurred was a process of\nculture shock and then a period of acculturation. When my parents\u2019 sponsors showed them how to\nuse the toilet by gesturing what to do and how to flush, my parents were embarrassed. Coming from\na culture where modesty is important, they did not know how to respond to the American sponsor\u2019s\ngestures, yet their embarrassment quickly turned into fascination when they saw how a toilet could\ndispose of materials.\nInterpreting body language became a critical piece of adaptation and learning. My parents found the\nexaggerated gestures of their sponsors turning on and off the stove \u201cdifferent.\u201d But it was paying\nattention to the facial gestures and body language that helped them to understand how to operate a\nstove. They realized certain things were the same across cultures: taking out a pot to boil water,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n30 placing it on a heated surface for the water to boil, taking the pot off the surface to let the water cool.\nThe differences, they noticed, were in the equipment used and the timing of the water boiling. What\na surprise it was for them to realize that one could adjust and control temperature!\nAs human beings who are accustomed to behaving (consciously and unconsciously) in specific ways,\nwe often do not recognize another perspective until it is presented to us. Ellen Langer, [1] a social\npsychologist, says that it is in the perspective of another that we learn to see ourselves\u2014to see who\nwe really are. As an educator and facilitator, I meet people in positions of leadership every day who\nbelieve that their perspective about culture and how they should work with differences is the right\nway and that there is no other possibility for a different way of working or thinking. For example, a\nparticipant in my training session, Jacob, felt very strongly about the \u201cinvasion\u201d (his word, not mine)\nof immigrants in his neighborhood. As a result, the city he worked for was increasingly diverse and\nwould need to set up services and programs to meet the needs of the new immigrants.\nAs a native of the city, Jacob felt strongly that his neighbors needed to assimilate more quickly. As a\ncity employee and manager, he felt excluded that the city would create new services for the\nimmigrants. His issue of conflict here was that he had developed proposals for expanding current\nservices in his department, but they were never approved, mostly because of budgetary reasons. He\ndid not understand why creating \u201cspecial services for a small population\u201d mattered more than the\nservices for current residents of the city, and he was angry that the funds set aside for the new\nprogramming would be large, much larger than his proposed changes.\nJacob, in this example, is bound to his single perspective or viewpoint. He cannot see beyond the\nsituation. And, in fact, when discussing this situation with Jacob and other managers present, other\npieces of the story began to unravel. Yes, Jacob had a perspective about immigrants based on his\nexperiences with one immigrant\u2013his neighbor. He used his knowledge and interactions with this\nperson to generalize to an entire population. Additionally, what really mattered to him in his place of\nwork was that he did not feel his ideas mattered. Because every time he proposed changes they were\nnot approved, he took that as a deliberate attack on him. This was not the case at all and he was told\nthis by his peers in the training.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n31 When Jacob was presented with another perspective, he let his guard down. Over time, he was able\nto focus on the real issue, which was that no matter what your status, creed, ethnicity, or reason for\nmoving to the United States, as a public sector employee it was his role to provide the appropriate\nservices that would meet the residents\u2019 needs.\nAs leaders, we must make strong efforts to see a different perspective than what we believe and hold\nto be true. We must challenge ourselves, as Byron Katie [2]says, by asking whether we know what we\nsee to be true is really, in fact, true. And if it is, how do we know that? What stories have we told\nourselves? To understand this, we need to look at the \u201croots of culture\u201d and how our cultural systems\nhave shaped our realities of the world.\n[1] Langer (1990).\n[2] Katie (2002).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n32 2.1 Cultural Systems\nImagine a tree as a metaphor for a cultural system\u2014all the things that make up who you are. The\nroots of a tree are essential for the survival of the tree. They carry the nutrients needed for the growth\nof the tree and store nutrients for later feeding. Roots of trees are generally located in the top 6 to 24\ninches of the ground, not too deep from the surface. The roots are impacted by their surrounding,\nand environmental factors contribute to their health and vitality.\nJust like the roots on a tree, cultural systems have roots that are impacted by their surroundings. A\nculture\u2019s rituals, traditions, ceremonies, myths, and symbols provide it with the nutrients it needs to\nsurvive. Environmental factors can change a tree by uprooting it or letting it die off, making space for\nnew life in its place. Similarly, environmental changes impact cultural systems, forcing it to adapt\nand change to its surroundings or transition into death, creating new cultural stories that carry new\nlife.\nBut unlike trees and their roots, we get stuck in our cultural systems and do not budge even when our\nsurroundings have changed. Trees, like anything in an ecosystem, have natural cycles of renewal and\nrebirth. Sometimes this renewal and rebirth is gradual and gentle, while other times it is fast,\ndisruptive, and violent. Trees, because they share their environments with others, will learn to adapt\nand allow change to occur, no matter what the direction of change may be. Change in their cultural\nenvironments is inevitable and a part of the life cycle.\nIn similar ways, we can think about our cultural systems as part of a larger system. Some cultural\nanthropologists would describe the cultural systems as \u201cbig C\u201d (macroculture) and \u201clittle C\u201d\n(microculture). The macroculture refers to a larger cultural system, for example, Catholicism is a\nculture that is not bounded by geography. Within the macroculture of Catholicism are smaller units\nof culture called subcultures. Change is constant in each cultural system, and transitions, renewal,\nand rebirth are endless cycles. As cultural shifts occur in the macro- and microcultures, small and\nlarge, gradual and disruptive, the entire system learns to adapt in different ways.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n33 2.2 What is Culture?\nDefinitions of culture cover a wide range of perspectives. When I ask participants in my business\nworkshops to describe culture, the following are words and phrases they use: food, religion, language,\nmusic, region or geography, ethnicity, clothes, and so on. Generally, there is always one person who\nraises his or her hand timidly and says, \u201cI think culture is more than that. It\u2019s the things we don\u2019t see,\nlike our beliefs or views about gender.\u201d Both are correct\u2014culture represents the things we see, the\ntangible, as well as the intangible things.\nFigure 2.1 Iceberg Metaphor\nThe iceberg, a commonly used metaphor to describe culture, is a great example for illustrating the\ntangible and the intangible. When talking about culture, most people focus on the \u201ctip of the\niceberg,\u201d which is considered as making up 10% of the object. The rest of the iceberg, 90% of it, is\nbelow the waterline. Most leaders in businesses, when addressing intercultural situations, pick up on\nthe things they see\u2014things on the \u201ctip of the iceberg.\u201d This means that they never address the\ncultural issues and problems that are underneath the surface level. Solutions become temporary\nband-aids covering deeply rooted cultural systems.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n34 I once had a manager describe and define culture as \u201ca monster.\u201d After some laughter from the\ngroup, he clarified his statement: \u201cIt\u2019s so messy and sometimes it\u2019s too big to handle. And, it\u2019s scary\nbecause you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d What he said rings true for many people and\nbusinesses that work in multicultural settings. It is certainly not fun to clean up cultural messes,\nbloopers, or misunderstandings, and when not addressed right away, they can result in large cultural\nconflicts. The ability to acknowledge one\u2019s cultural mistakes, and having a commitment to learning\nwhat culture brings, is a skill that one must have in cultural intelligence work.\nThis definition of culture as a \u201cmonster\u201d is one that looks at culture and its manifestations. Some\nmay even say it is negative and does not paint culture in a positive light. From my experiences\nworking with leaders, defining culture is not about positives or negatives\u2014culture just is, and that is\nwhy it can be a challenge to describe it. Definitions of culture usually incorporate an expression of\nvalues and beliefs of groups, the learning that occurs in groups, and the expressions of those cultural\nnorms.\nThe following is a definition of culture that is used in this book and that will be useful in your\nwork: [1]\nCulture consists of the shared beliefs, values, and assumptions of a group of people who learn\nfrom one another and teach to others that their behaviors, attitudes, and perspectives are the\ncorrect ways to think, act, and feel.\nIt is helpful if you can think about culture in the following five ways:\n\uf0b7 Culture is learned.\n\uf0b7 Culture is shared.\n\uf0b7 Culture is dynamic.\n\uf0b7 Culture is systemic.\n\uf0b7 Culture is symbolic.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n35 Figure 2.2 Elements of Culture\n[1] This definition of culture has been adapted from Edgar Schein\u2019s definition of culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n36 2.3 Culture is Learned\nGeert Hofstede [1] views culture as consisting of mental programs, calling it softwares of the mind,\nmeaning each person \u201ccarries within him or herself patterns of thinking, feeling, and potential acting\nwhich were learned throughout their lifetime.\u201d [2] Similarly, Peter Senge [3] argued that mental models\nlock individuals and groups into a specific perception about the world. Like a computer, we are\nprogrammed to act or behave in certain ways. The conscious and unconscious learning we undergo,\nover time, turns into beliefs that we consider to be valid. We then teach each other that these beliefs\nare cultural norms, and they are then expressed in our daily lives as behaviors and actions.\nThink about your first day with your current organization or one you worked for in the past.\nTypically, your boss or a co-worker gave you an orientation to the company, describing its mission,\nproducts, and services. Most likely, you met your co-workers and received a tour of the office\nfacilities. Perhaps you met and talked with co-workers to get a sense of how your job related to their\nwork. Maybe you spent time reading company materials, reviewing your department files, or talking\nwith your supervisor about the details of your job responsibilities. Perhaps you had lunch with other\nstaff members and were told about some parts of the organization such as, \u201cJane Doe should be fired\nbut is still working here,\u201d \u201cThe CEO has control issues,\u201d or \u201cThe fax machine breaks down three\ntimes a day.\u201d Whatever you did in those first hours or days of orientation and training, you created\nan image of how you would fit into the company. In that moment, you told yourself a story of how\nyou would work with the company and how it would work with you because others in that business\nculture told you how you needed to behave. This moment is so powerful that it shapes your\nexperiences, including your thoughts, actions, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes for the rest of your\ntime with the company.\n[1] Hofstede (1991).\n[2] Hofstede (1991), p. 4.\n[3] Senge (1990), pp. 8\u20139.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n37 2.4 Culture is Shared\nMing is a recent college graduate with a degree in accounting. She has taken a job with a large accounting\nfirm. Although she gets along with members of her department and team, she tends to spend her free time\nwith other colleagues who are of Asian descent, especially those who are in her generation. She feels that\nthis group of coworkers understands her better and shares her values and ideas around work\u2013life balance.\nJohn has been with his state employer for thirty years, working up the ranks into seniority in his state\nagency. It\u2019s been customary for him and six coworkers of his age group to meet for lunch every day and\ndiscuss the latest sporting events. Once a week during the summer they meet up after work to play\nbaseball at a local park and recreation site.\nThese two examples describe culture as a shared learning experience. Although you may think of\nyourself as an individual, you share beliefs, rituals, ceremonies, traditions, and assumptions with\npeople who grew up or live in similar cultural backgrounds. It is easier for you to relate to someone\nwho has shared value systems and ways of doing things than someone who does not share the same\nvalues.\nThe patterns of culture bind us together and enable us to get along with each other. Even though it\nfeels good to be around people who think, act, and behave as you, shared learning can create blind\nspots. Shared cultures create a dynamic of an in-group, where people segregate themselves from\neach other. Within teams in organizations, in-group blind spots can lead to \u201cgroup think,\u201d a term\ncoined by Irving Janis [1] to explain the ways in which groups ignore alternative solutions and take on\nactions and behaviors that discount the experiences for others.\n[1] Janis (1973), pp. 19\u201325.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n38 2.5\nCulture is Dynamic\nCulture is dynamic and thus complex. Culture is fluid rather than static, which means that culture\nchanges all the time, every day, in subtle and tangible ways. Because humans communicate and\nexpress their cultural systems in a variety of ways, it can be hard to pinpoint exactly what cultural\ndynamics are at play. Consider, for example, a conversation about a person\u2019s attitude or feelings. In\nthis type of conversation, Albert Meharbian [1] found that people pay attention to (a) the words, or\nwhat is being said; (b) the tone, or how the words are said; and (c) the visual behind the words, often\ncalled the body language. All of these are aspects of culture that are interpreted differently depending\non the cultural context. Add multiple layers of culture to the conversation\u2014such as time, power and\nauthority, emotion, age, gender, religion, nationality, and even previous intercultural interactions\u2014\nand communication at a cross-cultural level becomes complex and hard to manage. The following is\nan example of the dynamism of cultures:\nSheila is the director of marketing for a social services agency. She provides feedback to one of her\nmanagers about how to improve services. Sheila sits behind a large executive desk and is leaning forward.\nThe employee sits with her arms crossed, leaning away from Sheila.\nIf you were observing this scene, are you able to tell from the body language what each person is\nthinking? Why or why not? What cultural factors might be present?\nIn the example, Sheila\u2019s body language can be interpreted as any of the following: eager to assist or\nhelp, intensely interested in what the employee has to say, aggressive and wanting more information,\nor needing deeper engagement in the conversation. Her employee\u2019s body language could mean any of\nthe following: protective, suspicious, not caring, or relaxed. To understand the dynamics of culture in\nthis example, you would need to pay attention to the things you do not see such as:\n\uf0b7 Is Sheila older or younger than her employee?\n\uf0b7 What has been their working relationship?\n\uf0b7 Does Sheila naturally lean forward when speaking with her employees?\n\uf0b7 What is the tone of voice in the conversation?\n[1] Meharbian (1971).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n39 2.6 Culture is Systemic\nIn systems theory, systems are interrelated, interconnected parts that create a whole. There are\npatterns of behavior, deeply rooted structural systems, which are beneath the waterline. What we see\nat the top of the iceberg are the behaviors; we do not see what contributes to those behaviors.\nConsider, for example, a white woman walking down a quiet street. She quickly clutches her handbag\ncloser to her body as she passes a black man. Then, when she spots a white man walking toward her,\nshe loosens her hold on the purse.\nTo address the system, one must be able to address the underlining patterns. These patterns, because\nthey are deeply embedded in the system, will take up significant effort, time, and resources. Changes\nto the system are slow and gradual; visible changes may not appear until months, or even years,\nlater.\nBecause most leaders spend their time evaluating and finding solutions to an \u201cevent,\u201d they revisit the\nissues over and over again, with no positive and sustainable results. The following case study\nillustrates the systemic nature of culture:\nFigure 2.3 Culture from a Systems Approach\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n40 Langley, Knox, and Cooper, a law firm in the Midwest, knows that it has to do more to be inclusive to\nwomen attorneys. It has met challenges in retaining its female work force. The majority of women hired to\nwork at the firm leave within a three year period. To address the issue, the firm provides gender sensitivity\ntraining to the entire company, attends graduate career fairs to actively recruit female attorneys, and has\nquotas for promoting women. However, the efforts in the past five years have yielded little results.\nLangley, Knox, and Cooper focus much of their attention on the \u201cevents\u201d of the system: women\nleaving after three years or providing gender sensitivity training. A look at the structural patterns\nreveals a more complex issue that cannot be solved through training and career fairs. The structural\npattern is an insidious belief that women enter the law profession with the same opportunities and\naccess to practicing law as men in the firm. Underlining this belief are more patterns of thought that\nkeep this structural pattern in place. Possible patterns of thought could be:\nFigure 2.4 A Systems Approach to Find Structural Patterns in Gender Conflicts\n\uf0b7 Other women attorneys don\u2019t have this problem, what\u2019s the big deal here?\n\uf0b7 Everyone faces the same challenges in making partner. It\u2019s part of becoming a lawyer.\n\uf0b7 We match our junior attorneys with senior attorneys who serve as their mentors. Everyone gets the\nsame level of attention, so I am not sure what all the complaints are about.\n\uf0b7 This law firm is different from others. If they don\u2019t like it here, then they can leave.\n\uf0b7 We give the women in this firm more time off and flexibility than ever before, yet they still think it\u2019s\nnot enough.\nUnderstanding the thoughts help leaders to recognize that yearly gender sensitivity training would\nnever work. These thought patterns, when combined and supported (intentionally or not), are\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n41 difficult to unravel. The systemic nature of the problem becomes more complex and chaotic as time\ngoes by and the issues are not addressed.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n42 2.7 Culture is Symbolic\nSymbols are both verbal and nonverbal in form within cultural systems, and they have a unique way\nof linking human beings to each other. Humans create meaning between symbols and what they\nrepresent; as a result, different interpretations of a symbol can occur in different cultural contexts.\nTake, for example, a meeting of senior executives who need to make a decision about a new service.\nThis group of leaders has a team culture that orients itself toward a democratic process: decision\nmaking is based on one vote from each member. Now imagine a similar group of leaders with the\nsame task but, this time, the group of leaders is comprised of Native Americans. Leaders who are\nyounger in the group ask their elders for advice. This is an example of how cultural systems differ in\ntheir interpretation and expressions of culture. In some cultural systems, voting is not an option. The\nsymbol of a vote has different meanings and interpretations\u2014or simply may not even exist in any\npractical sense\u2014depending on the cultural background.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n43 2.8 Stereotypes and Generalizations\nOne of the things that can happen in the context of discussing culture is falling into the stereotypes\nand generalizations of a cultural group or norm. It is important to recognize the difference and the\nimpact these factors have in cultural interactions. In general, stereotypes are negative statements and\ninterpretations made about a group of people. Stereotypes, whether deemed positive or negative,\nplace people into boxes and categories and limit them to those specific perspectives. A stereotype,\nsuch as \u201cAsians are good at math,\u201d does not provide the complete picture someone needs to\nunderstand the Asian culture or the differences between Asian cultures. Similarly, just because you\nmeet a 70-year old who does not know how to use current technology, it does not mean that other\nindividuals in that generation do not know how to use it.\nBy contrast, generalizations of cultures are broad statements based on facts, experiences, examples,\nor logic. There are two kinds of generalizations, valid and faulty, and it is your role to determine\nwhich generalizations have validity behind them. Broad characterization of cultural groups can serve\nas a framework for cultural interactions. For example, Hispanic societies have a high degree of\nmachismo, or, in Middle Eastern cultures, women have a lesser status than men\u2014these types of\ngeneralizations are helpful when engaging with people of those cultures. But in all cultural\ninteractions, culturally intelligent leadership requires you to recognize that generalizations do not\napply to everyone within a cultural group.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n44 2.9 Levels of Culture\nOne of the basic tenets of culture is that it consists of levels and sublevels. It is useful to think about\nculture in terms of five basic levels: national, regional, organizational, team, and individual. Within\neach of these levels are tangible and intangible sublevels of culture.\nNational Culture\nA businesswoman from the United States is in Germany for contract negotiations between her employer\nand a large German bank. The meeting is scheduled for nine o\u2019clock in the morning. When she arrives to\nthe meeting a few minutes before its start time, she is amazed that all her German counterparts are\nalready seated and ready to begin the meeting. A few days later, upon her arrival back to the United\nStates, she remarks to her American colleagues her experience with German culture. In particular, she\nnotes their level of attentiveness to punctuality and planning and says, \u201cI thought we were punctual here\nin the U.S.! It\u2019s nothing compared to how Germans view punctuality.\u201d\nThis example illustrates the national differences between two cultures: American and German. National\ndifferences refer to the cultural influences of a nation that result in its national characteristics. Although\nnation-states have regional and political differences, national culture can be viewed as the values held by a\nmajority of the population within the nation. These values are largely unconscious and developed\nthroughout one\u2019s childhood. The values are pushed to a level of consciousness when in contrast to another\nnation\u2019s cultural values.\nWithin national cultures, values are generally seen as stable over time. National values, because they\nreflect the traditions of the nation-state over time, will change slightly from generation to generation, but\nthe overall values will remain the same. For example, a German who comes from a culture of punctuality\nand travels for business in Italy will notice a national cultural difference in how Italians view time (more\nleisurely and relaxed) as compared to their own national culture.\nRegional Culture\nAn interesting thing about living in the United States is the regional differences that make each part of the\ncountry unique. When I attended college in Boston, I heard the expression \u201cwicked\u201d used quite often.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n45 After asking my New England friends what \u201cwicked\u201d meant, I learned that it was used to emphasize a\npoint. If I attended a concert that I really enjoyed, I would say, \u201cThat concert was awesome!\u201d New\nEnglanders would say, \u201cThat concert was wicked awesome.\u201d After living in the Boston area for 4 years, the\nword became a part of my vocabulary. When I used the word in conversations with my friends and family\nmembers in Minnesota, they did not understand what I meant.\nAll national cultures consist of regional subcultures that influence the characteristics of one group from\nanother in a nation state. The word \u201cpop\u201d refers to a soft drink in the Midwest, but if you go to the East\nCoast, it is referred to as \u201csoda.\u201d In other regions of the United States, a soft drink is referred to as \u201cCoke.\u201d\nThe following is an example of regional cultural differences and one way the difference is expressed:\nDianne moves from Texas for a job opportunity in Georgia. She lives in Georgia for 25 years and feels that\nit is her home state. However, her neighbors and co-workers do not think that she is a Georgian. Even\nthough Dianne thinks she is from the south, she is reminded by others that she is \u201cnot a southerner.\u201d\nDianne experiences a regional cultural shift that she did not know existed until her move. Although she\nconsiders herself a Georgian, she is constantly reminded that she is not a southerner. At a conscious and\nunconscious level, her regional cultural experiences will dictate her thoughts about herself and others. She\nmay develop the following assumptions and beliefs as a result of the regional cultural influences:\n\uf0b7 I better just tell people that I am from Texas.\n\uf0b7 Georgians think that you have to be from certain states to be considered a \u201csoutherner.\u201d\n\uf0b7 If you are from the south, you must have lineage or roots that directly link you to the south. A\n\u201ctransplant\u201d is not considered a true southerner.\nWhat are regional differences and similarities that you have experienced or have been a part of? The\nfollowing is a chart to help you identify regional similarities and cultures. In the column labeled \u201cRegional\nCulture Names,\u201d write down two regions of a nation or country, such as West Coast and New England.\nThen, for each cultural expression listed, write down the regional similarities and differences you notice\nabout each region you have chosen to identify.\nTable 2.1 Exercise to Identify Regional Cultural Differences and Similarities\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n46 Regional Culture Names Cultural Expression Regional Differences Regional Similarities\nFood\nDress code\nLanguage\nHousing\nMusic\nOrganizational Culture\nWhen you walk into a Target Store, what do you see? What does it look like? What kinds of items do they\nsell? What do you see when you walk into a Wal-Mart? What does it look like? What types of people shop\nat Wal-Mart? Who works there?\nShoppers have different experiences walking into a Target versus a Wal-Mart store because even though\nthey are both retailers, their buildings are different, the types of products they carry vary from each other,\nthe workers wear different clothes, the layout of a Wal-Mart store is very different from the layout of a\nTarget store, and the behaviors expressed by workers in each organization are unique to each retailer.\nThese elements give the organization its distinct culture that separates it from the other.\nOrganizational culture speaks to the culture that is specific to an organization\u2014the culture that makes it\ndistinctive from competitors and non-competitors. Organizational cultures are often referred to as\n\u201ccorporate cultures\u201d and reflect the beliefs, values, and assumptions of an organization. For example, the\nculture of one school in a school district can be different than the culture of another school located in the\nsame district simply because of what the people in one school culture adhere and react to.\nTeam Culture\nLupe oversees a business division that includes sales people, engineers, research, and customer service\nstaff. All teams work in different ways to accomplish their business strategies, but they also have work that\nis cross functional, relying on each other to get their work completed. At times, Lupe is overwhelmed at\nthe teams\u2019 cultural differences and the impact it has on productivity and sales. She knows that each team\nhas their own working styles, but she didn\u2019t realize how much these styles could interfere in the day to day\noperations of the division.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n47 The sales department seems more outgoing and energetic than her engineers, who as a whole seem\nintroverted and serious. Her researchers are detailed and scientific in nature, always questioning the\ntactics of the sales people. Her customer service employees who are by nature people and service friendly\nand always wanting to make sure everyone gets along. These departments work well, but Lupe knows that\nsilos in the organization can hinder growth and creativity.\nThe example above illustrates culture at the team level. The values, beliefs, and norms of culture are\npresent in team environments, dictating the team\u2019s operations and efficiency. Cultural norms in teams\nguide members in their dress and appearance, their language, how they relate to one another, and how\nthey get along. Some teams are very serious, while others use humor in their work life. Departments,\nteams, or workgroups can, and will, act very differently from each other even though they are located in\nthe same building and in the same organization. Although you might not think about personality or\ntemperament as cultural elements, they can and do shape a team\u2019s culture.\nIndividual Culture\nIndividual cultural differences relate to your preferences for things through your personal experiences\nthat include the influence of your family, your peers, school, media, co-workers, and so on. You may share\na national culture, such as being an American, with another person and live in the same regional culture,\nthe Midwest. You may even work with the person in the same organization and department, thus sharing\nan organizational and team culture, and even though you share similar interests, you will likely have\ndifferences in individual culture based on who you are and your social upbringing. The following example\nillustrates these individual differences:\nBao, 31 years old and Hua, 32 years old, are both Chinese American managers living in San Francisco.\nThey both grew up in the area as third generation Chinese Americans. Both attended universities on the\nEast Coast in the same city and majored in public policy. Bao and Hua work for a national nonprofit that\nfunds grassroots leadership projects in Chinese-American communities in the United States. Both work in\nthe programming department of their organization and have been there four years each.\nBao and Hua, although similar in their cultural backgrounds, have different perspectives based on their\nindividual cultures. Bao\u2019s mother passed away while she was very young and she was raised by her father\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n48 and aunts. Her father was not around because of long work hours. Bao, with the help of her aunts, raised\nher younger siblings. Her mother\u2019s death was a significant event in her life as she felt she did not have the\nmother-daughter relationship that many of her peers did. As a result she is overly protective.\nHua is the youngest child in her family. Both her parents are still alive. Hua was raised around many of\nher relatives who took care of her while her parents were working. She has always been given what she\nwanted or needed. Whenever Hua had a problem, her older siblings took care of the situation. As a result,\nHua is quite relaxed in her demeanor and approach to life.\nWhen Bao and Hua make programming decisions, Bao approaches her decision-making process from a\nmethodical and careful perspective, always looking out for the program\u2019s and organization\u2019s needs. Hua,\non the other side, is more relaxed in her approach, more willing to allow for flexibility and ambiguity.\nBao and Hua\u2019s cultural experiences have shaped them into different individuals and have impacted their\nmanagerial and leadership styles. Even though they share many similar cultural experiences, their\nindividual cultural experiences have strong influences on them. Bao\u2019s methodical and careful decision-\nmaking processes are a result of her having to be responsible at a very early age. Hua\u2019s relaxed approach\ncomes about because of her experiences as the youngest child and always knowing that she would be\ntaken care of\u2014that everything would be okay in the end.\nThese five levels of culture are important to think about and recognize, but it should also be understood\nthat each of these cultures can be expressed in subcultures or microcultures. Not everyone acts or behaves\nthe same in a national culture such as the United States. There are regional, county, and city differences\nwithin the national culture of being an \u201cAmerican.\u201d There are religious differences as well as gender\ncultures, ability and disability cultures, cultures revolving around sexual orientation, and even cultures\ncentered around concepts or states of being, for example, the culture of homelessness or the culture of\njuvenile delinquency.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n49 2.10 The Roots of Culture\nCultures show up in many forms and are expressed differently. Yet all forms and levels of cultures\nexpress and share three fundamental aspects: values, assumptions, and symbols.\nValues\nYou need to recognize that value systems are fundamental to understanding how culture expresses\nitself. Values often serve as principles that guide people in their behaviors and actions. Our values, ideally,\nshould match up with what we say we will do, and our values are most evident in symbolic forms.\nConsider, for example, a picture of the American flag. If you were an American, what words do the\npictures evoke for you? Freedom, liberty, America, united, independence, democracy, or patriotism,\nperhaps?\nWhat if a Nazi symbol were painted on the American flag? How would that make you feel? Disgusted, sad,\nangry, revengeful? What would the desecration of the flag symbolize? Hatred, terrorism, nationalism?\nWhat about freedom of speech? Symbols like the American flag evoke strong emotions for people, and\nwhen the symbol is desecrated, it can feel like a personal attack on the person\u2019s value system and their\nbeliefs about the world. It feels out of alignment from what we believe to be true\u2014what we see as our\nreality of the world. This is because our values and beliefs are rooted in stories we tell ourselves over and\nover again.\nJoseph Campbell [1] noted that stories and myths are our psychological maps of the world. We use them to\nguide our thinking and behaviors, and when we do not like a story or it does not align with stories we\nknow, we discard them. We learn through culture to create a story about the story. Campbell said that\nwhen we can unravel our stories, we begin to see the meaning we have placed on them and the impact\nthey have on our lives. The case study that follows illustrates this notion of values:\nJames works full-time managing a fast food restaurant chain. Working extra hours every week helps him\nbring home more income for his family of four. He will do whatever it takes to help take care of his family.\nAna is also a manager in the same restaurant. She works her forty hours a week and then goes home to her\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n50 family of three. She doesn\u2019t want to work more hours because she wants to spend as much time with her\nfamily as possible.\nHow does James\u2019s perspective of family differ from Ana\u2019s? What assumptions does each have about the\nvalue of family? What might be the stories they are creating for themselves that shape their values of\nfamily? Both individuals have the same value of family, but their values are expressed differently through\ntheir behaviors. A value such as family can be expressed and thought of differently from one culture to the\nnext or from one person to the next. James believes that working hard illustrates his value of family, while\nAna believes that spending time with her family demonstrates her commitment to the value. These\nassumptions are not expressed verbally, and, in some cases, the assumptions can be unconscious. Notice\nhow, in the following scenario, James\u2019 assumptions are challenged:\nBoth Ana and James receive a bonus for their work. James finds out that Ana has received the same\npercentage of bonus that he has. He\u2019s quite upset because he knows that he works more than she does and\nsometimes covers her shifts when she has family emergencies or is late because of day care issues. He\nthinks to himself, \u201cHow could she get the same bonus as me? She doesn\u2019t even work that hard and she\ncomes in late to her shift using excuses that her day care didn\u2019t show up again.\u201d\nIn the case study, the assumptions that James has of Ana (Ana makes excuses; Ana comes in late; or Ana\ndoes not work hard) can become a problem and conflict between the two. His assumptions are based on\nhis own definition of family, which could consist of any of the following: be responsible, show up on time,\nor working hard can bring in more money for the family. His assumptions are challenged when Ana\nreceives the same bonus for a perceived different level of commitment.\nAs a leader, it is important to understand and identify to employees that most of us share the same values.\nIt is our interpretation and expression of the values that creates the conflict. Many people justify bias and\ndiscrimination on the grounds of \u201cvalues\u201d without realizing that it is not the values themselves but the\ndifference between our expression and interpretation and that of those we come into conflict with.\nAssumptions\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n51 Our values are supported by our assumptions of our world. They are beliefs or ideas that we believe and\nhold to be true. They come about through repetition. This repetition becomes a habit we form and leads to\nhabitual patterns of thinking and doing. We do not realize our assumptions because they are ingrained in\nus at an unconscious level. We are aware of it when we encounter a value or belief that is different from\nours, when it makes us feel that we need to stand up for, or validate, our beliefs.\nIn the iceberg analogy, assumptions are underneath the waterline. They define for us, and give life or\nmeaning to, objects, people, places, and things in our lives. Our assumptions about our world determine\nhow we react emotionally and what actions we need to take. The assumptions about our world views guide\nour behaviors and shape our attitudes. Consider, for example, the following case study:\nKong grows up in SE Asia and has seen only males in leadership roles. Once he moves to the U.S., he\nassumes males are the only authority figures. Meanwhile his daughters, Sheng and Lia, who have grown\nup in the U.S. and were raised with access to education and resources learn that they can be leaders. In\ntheir professional work they are seen by their peers as leaders.\nOne day, at a celebration event that Sheng brings him to, Kong meets a White man who is her supervisor.\nHe tells Kong, \u201cYour daughter is a great leader. She\u2019s really helped us through this transition.\u201d He replies\npolitely, \u201cThank you.\u201d Later, Kong shares with his wife, Ka, the story. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he thinks\nSheng is a leader. Women are not leaders. Only men are leaders.\u201d\nSymbols\nAnthropologist Clifford Geertz [2] believed that culture was a system based on symbols. He said that people\nuse symbols to define their world and express their emotions. As human beings, we all learn, both\nconsciously and unconsciously, starting at a very young age. What we internalize comes through\nobservation, experience, interaction, and what we are taught. We manipulate symbols to create meaning\nand stories that dictate our behaviors, to organize our lives, and to interact with others. The meanings we\nattach to symbols are arbitrary. Looking someone in the eye means that you are direct and respectful in\nsome countries, yet, in other cultural systems, looking away is a sign of respect. The meanings we attach\nto symbols can create a cultural havoc when we meet someone who believes in a different meaning or\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n52 interpretation; it can give us culture shock. This shock can be disorientating, confusing, or surprising. It\ncan bring on anxiety or nervousness, and, for some, a sense of losing control.\nWhile training senior managers in a leadership program, the issue of the organization\u2019s dress code came\nup in our conversation about differences. All the managers were in agreement that there was a dress code\nproblem. It seemed to the managers that a couple of the employees were not abiding by the dress code\npolicy. At this mid-size organization, the dress code was business casual, but a couple of the employees\n(the younger ones to be exact) came into work wearing t-shirts or dresses with thin straps. The managers\nwere all confused as to why the dress code was so hard to follow for these two employees. It was obvious\nto them that business casual meant looking professional and neat, wearing clothes that were pressed and\ncrisp. No matter how many times the dress code was explained to the staff, these two employees never\nchanged.\nIn the training, we deconstructed the issue to understand what was really at play. The managers\nrecognized that the dress code of \u201cbusiness casual\u201d could mean several things if not explicitly stated in the\npolicy. In fact, one manager said, \u201cWe keep saying that business casual is common sense, but our idea of\ncommon sense could be completely different from that employee\u2019s version of common sense.\u201d They also\ndiscovered that they did not want to be so explicit as to name every article of clothing that employees\ncould and could not wear. They felt that being explicit would take away the feeling or the symbol that the\noffice was a casual and relaxed environment; having policies that dictated everything that someone could\nor could not do would symbolize a different type of working environment.\nAs a result of this conversation, the managers recognized the tangible ways in which symbols are\nmanifested in organizations. They became more mindful of the language and words used. They were more\nintentional about their behavior, now recognizing that each of their reactions or non-reactions is a\nsymbol.\n[1] Campbell (1988).\n[2] Geertz (1973).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n53 2.11 Value Dimensions of Culture\nThe work of Geert Hofstede, [1] while employed at IBM in the late 1960s to early 1970s, still stands as\none of the most comprehensive studies of cultural values on leadership in the workplace. From his\ndata collected from over 30 countries and 100,000 individuals, Hofstede created a model of value\ndimensions that speak to the ways that cultures tend to operate. Although this study is generalized to\nspecific countries, his work on cultural value dimensions is helpful to any business doing global and\nmulticultural work.\nAccording to Hofstede, the five main dimensions are identity, power, gender, uncertainty, and time.\nYou can think about cultural value dimensions on a scale or a continuum, where one aspect of the\nvalue lies on one side of the scale and the other extreme lies at the other end of the scale.\nTable 2.2 Five Cultural Value Dimensions\nValue Dimensions One Extreme Other Extreme\nIdentity Group Individual\nPower Egalitarian Hierarchal\nGender Feminine Masculine\nUncertainty Ambiguity Structure\nTime Relationship Task\nCultural value dimensions help you to understand culture and to be able to make sense of culture.\nThese dimensions provide you with a perspective of culture for yourself as well as a perspective of\nhow others perceive their culture. All cultures experience these dimensions of difference in many\nways, and different cultures solve these differences in many ways. Becoming aware of these concepts\nhelps you to figure out the experiences you have in relation to your culture. It helps to make that\nexperience less ambiguous and threatening. Cultural value dimensions provide clarity and a starting\nplace for cultural awareness. However, they are often seen as intangible and under the waterline, but\nonce you adapt to the cultural dimensions, you become more comfortable and do not see the cultural\ndifference.\nIdentity\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n54 The value dimension of identity refers to the attention of groups or individuals toward group needs versus\nindividual needs as well as toward individual achievement and interpersonal relationships. On a\ncontinuum, you see the identity value dimension expressed as such in Figure 2.5 \"Dimension of Identity\".\nFigure 2.5 Dimension of Identity\nOn one spectrum, there is an expectation of doing things for the group rather than for oneself. On the\nother side, achievements and needs are individualized. Hofstede [2] found that cultures placing a high\nvalue on individualism and a low value on collectivism valued individual rights; cultures placing a high\nvalue on collectivism valued relationships and harmony. This orientation, he argued, can have a large\naffect on managing organizations and people.\nFor example, in many Latino cultures, the concept of family, la familia, is critical to their cultural history\nand social systems. La familia is the most important social unit and includes extended family members.\nDecision making, conflict resolution, and negotiation are based on group needs rather than individual\npreferences; through paying attention to group and collective needs, harmony and relationships are\nintact. Alternatively, in individualistic cultures, the need of the individual comes first. U.S. culture teaches\nthis to children at a young age. The following is an example that illustrates the differences between\nindividualist and collectivist cultures:\nMary takes her eight year old, Johnny, to the store to buy ice-cream. She asks him to choose what ice-\ncream flavor he would like. Over time he learns to tell his mother about his personal likes and dislikes.\nEvery time his mother responds to his decisions with encouragement. Over time he learns that he can and\nshould be able to express himself.\nBy encouraging her child to make decisions and choices on his own, Mary raises a child that considers his\npersonal needs and wants. If Johnny was in a group that operated more collectively, he might become\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n55 quite upset when told that the whole group must agree to a specific ice cream flavor, that is, that his\npersonal choice does not matter in the group decision.\nThe following is another example of individual and collective cultures:\nA history teacher gives a lesson on the Bill of Rights to her students. She explains that everyone has\nindividual rights and liberties. Sahara is a student in the class. She is thirteen years old and a recent\nimmigrant from Somali. She learns that she has individual rights and to the disappointment and\nfrustration of her parents, her behaviors begin to change at home. She comes home late from school, she\nstops doing her chores, and she talks back to her mother. She says, \u201cI can do whatever I want. In this\ncountry, I am free!\u201d\nSahara comes from a culture that is collective and tribal in nature. Her parents express confusion when\nthey hear her say, \u201cI can do whatever I want.\u201d They do not understand what she means and why she says\nwhat she says. They begin to think that she is losing her cultural values.\nThe following is another example that illustrates the value differences between collectivist and\nindividualist cultures:\nTabitha is 22 years old and moves in with her college boyfriend, Randy, to an apartment near her parents.\nTom and Susan, Tabitha\u2019s parents, are excited that she is able to be independent and to live on her own.\nXioli is Tabitha and Randy\u2019s friend from college. She is Chinese American and wants to move out of her\nparents\u2019 house. Randy and Tabitha have offered the second bedroom space for Xioli in their apartment.\nXioli\u2019s parents think she is too young to live on her own. They also think it is a sign of disrespect to them if\nshe, as a single woman, lives with a man.\nPower\nHofstede defined power distance dimensions as maintaining strict rules that establish the types of\nrelationships individuals have with one another. Power represents the level of inequality and equality, as\nwell as the level of hierarchy and upward mobility, within a cultural group. In regard to leadership, power\ndimension can also represent a culture\u2019s tendencies toward authority, on one end, and one\u2019s orientation\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n56 toward laissez-faire leadership, on the other. Hofstede found that low-power-distance cultures\nemphasized equality and minimized power and status. The following is an example of this:\nSusan is the president of a large manufacturing business. Although she is in a position of leadership and\nauthority, she takes a \u201chands off management approach\u201d to her employees, and in meetings provides a\nparticipatory, democratic engagement process.\nSusan\u2019s dimension of power is illustrated in Figure 2.6 \"Power Value Dimension\".\nFigure 2.6 Power Value Dimension\nGender\nHofstede [3] describes the value dimension of gender as representing two paradigms of thinking and\npractice about the world in relation to traditional values associated with gender roles. Gender refers to the\nculture\u2019s tendencies or orientation toward enforcing or reinforcing masculine and feminine roles in work.\nMasculine cultures tend to emphasize ambition, control, competition, assertiveness, and achievement,\nwhereas feminine cultures emphasize nurture, care, sharing, quality of life, and relationships. Sometimes\nthese values are expressed as the \u201cquantity of life\u201d and the \u201cquality of life.\u201d\nIn his findings, Hofstede indicated that cultures that rate high in masculinity, such as Japan, Austria,\nVenezuela, and Italy, revealed a high proportion of males in dominant structures; in low masculine\ncultures, such as Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, and Sweden, women were treated more equally in their\nsocial systems.\nIt is important that you recognize that these values are not associated with being male or female. In other\nwords, this does not mean that men cannot be part of feminine cultures or that women do not orient\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n57 themselves toward \u201cmasculine\u201d cultural values. Finally, like other value dimensions, gender dimensions\ncan vary greatly within any culture.\nYou can think about the value dimension of gender in the ways displayed in Figure 2.7 \"Gender\nDimensions\".\nFigure 2.7 Gender Dimensions\nUncertainty\nThe dimension of uncertainty emphasizes cultures that are either oriented toward uncertainty or toward\ncreating certainty and stability. Hofstede described this as a society\u2019s tolerance for ambiguity. [4] Societies\nthat are in high uncertainty avoidance are rule-bound and pay more attention to written procedures,\nrules, or goals. Individuals who have a higher need for formalized structures, procedures, or diplomacy\ntend to minimize their uncertainty levels in order to cope with the unknowns of their situations. Someone\nwho is on the other extreme of the dimension is more relaxed about the rules and procedures; they are\nmore flexible in their attitudes toward rules and policies. The value dimension can be expressed in the\nways shown in Figure 2.8 \"Uncertainty Value Dimension\".\nFigure 2.8 Uncertainty Value Dimension\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n58 This dimension also speaks to a culture\u2019s orientation toward directness and honesty. Edward\nHall [5] popularized the terms \u201chigh-text\u201d culture and \u201clow-text\u201d culture to describe cultural differences\nbetween two different types of societies. The ideas are often used to describe the ways in which cultures\ncommunicate and to understand what cultural constructs underlie the communication.\nHigh-context cultures are societies in which people often make inferences; they leave things unsaid,\nknowing that the other person would understand what was implied in the communication. People in these\nsocieties tend to rely on groups for support. Low-context cultures are societies that are explicit and direct\nin their communication. They generally are more comfortable relying on themselves, as individuals, and\nworking out solutions to problems. Like high-context cultures, relationships are important to low-context\nsocieties; the difference is in the longevity of the relationships. Generally, low-context societies have many\nrelationships that are less intimate and close than those of high-context cultures.\nBoth types of cultural differentiations are illustrated in Table 2.3 \"High and Low Context Culture\nDescriptors\".\nTable 2.3 High and Low Context Culture Descriptors\nCultural How They Perceive the\nContext Countries/Cultures Descriptors Other Context\nSpain\nMexico\nGreece\n\uf0b7 Less verbally explicit communication Low-context cultures are\u2026\nMiddle East\n\uf0b7 Implied meanings \uf0b7 relationship-avoidant\nChina\nJapan \uf0b7 Long-term relationships \uf0b7 too aggressive\nKorean \uf0b7 Decisions and activities focus around \uf0b7 focused too much on\nHigh context Thailand personal, face-to-face relationships tasks and goals\nUnited States\n\uf0b7 Rule-oriented High-context cultures\u2026\nGermany\n\uf0b7 Knowledge is public and accessible \uf0b7 are too ambiguous\nGreat Britain\n\uf0b7 Short-term relationships \uf0b7 are quiet and modest\nLow context Australia \uf0b7 Task-centered \uf0b7 ask a lot of questions\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n59 Time\nThe dimension of time speaks to how communities are oriented toward space and time, including their\ntendencies toward traditions and the past, and their orientation toward the future and the present. In\nmany cultural systems, holding on to traditions is important in current day-to-day operations and\nrelationships. Some societies will refer to traditions to preserve and maintain cultural norms, that is, to\nprotect what currently exists.\nTime is also a reference to a culture\u2019s orientation toward tasks or relationships. For example, a manager\nfrom the United States who travels to India to negotiate a business contract needs to know that meetings\nwill occur whenever people show up to the meeting, which could be hours after it is scheduled. A task-\noriented leader is certain to be frustrated when he meets up with an Indian who is more time-oriented\ntoward relationships. In the American perspective, promptness is professionalism; yet, in the other\nperspective, the concept of time is more loose and flexible. The value of time is illustrated in Figure 2.9\n\"Time Value Dimension\".\nFigure 2.9 Time Value Dimension\nUnderstanding these five value dimensions and their impact in different cultural systems will be helpful to\nyour work in cultural intelligence. Like any cultural model, you need to recognize that cultural factors in\nleadership and organizations, as indicated by Taylor Cox, differ \u201cacross gender, nationality, and\nracial/ethnic groups as it relates to time and space orientation, leadership style orientations,\nindividualism versus collectivism, competitive versus cooperative behavior, locus of control, and\ncommunication styles.\u201d [6] You must recognize that microcultures exist within macrocultures; this is\nsignificant in working effectively on a cross-cultural level.

Like other\ncultural systems, organizational culture controls the behavior, values, assumptions, and beliefs of\norganizational members. It is a combination of organizational members\u2019 own beliefs and the values,\nbeliefs, and assumptions of the organization. It is the role of the organizational leader, as a change\nagent, to help create a positive organizational culture that meets the demands of a competitive\nenvironment, board and shareholder expectations, and employee career satisfaction.\nSince the mid-1990s,\ntheGlobal Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE)[1] research of 62 societies has\nserved as a significant study for understanding how cultural value dimensions are expressed in\ndifferent cultures\u2014whether societal or organizational. Knowledge and awareness of cultural values\ncan enable leaders and managers to effectively manage and work through intercultural conflict and\ninteractions. Over 17,000 managers from 951 organizations in 62 societies participated in focus\ngroups, questionnaires, and interviews for this study.\nCultural Value Dimensions\nThe GLOBE study found that nine core dimensions of cultures exist in different societies. The first six\ndimensions in the chart below originated from the cultural value dimensions Geert Hofstede proposed in\nthe 1980s. Table 2.4 \"Cultural Dimensions as Researched in the GLOBE Study\" lists other dimensions, as\nwell as their definitions, as described in the GLOBE study. [2]\nBased on the responses generated by the study and using other research, the GLOBE researchers grouped\nsocieties into regional clusters. The clusters were a way of creating meaning around societal views of\nculture and leadership. Each cluster had characteristics specific to their region, language, religion, history,\nand shared cultural understanding. Table 2.5 \"GLOBE Clusters of Societies\" and Table 2.6 \"Clusters of\nSocieties and their Cultural Value Dimensions\" lists each cluster and the countries that were grouped into\nthe clusters.\nLeadership Behaviors and Culture\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n62 The findings of the GLOBE study served to help organizations and societies understand what made an\neffective or ineffective leader. Many leadership behaviors are similar across societies, pointing out that no\nmatter the cultural difference or society in which a leader is from, there are specific leadership behaviors\nthat are viewed as effective. The GLOBE project was significant in indicating how cultures perceive\neffective and ineffective leadership, which is helpful to leaders in facilitating intercultural interactions.\nThe study revealed six global leadership behaviors, which were used in the study to understand how the\nclusters perceived leadership. These six are charismatic/value-based, team-oriented, participative,\nhumane-oriented, autonomous, and self-protective. Using their understanding of leadership behaviors\nand perceptions of leadership from each cluster group, the researchers were able to identify a leadership\nprofile for each cluster. Table 2.7 \"GLOBE Study of Key Leadership Behaviors\" and Table 2.8 \"Leadership\nBehavior Profiles for Clusters\" list the six leadership behaviors and their characteristics as well as the\nleadership profile for each cluster.\nTable 2.4 Cultural Dimensions as Researched in the GLOBE Study\nGlobe Dimension One Extreme Other Extreme\nUncertainty Need for established social norms, rituals, Comfortable with ambiguity and\navoidance and practices predictability\nHierarchy, authority, disparity in status and\nPower distance Egalitarian and nonhierarchal wealth\nInstitutional Collective actions and sharing of resources\ncollectivism encouraged Individual actions and goals are encouraged\nIn-group Noncohesiveness, loyal to oneself and one\u2019s\ncollectivism Expressions of pride, loyalty, and cohesion needs\nGender\negalitarianism Nurture, care, relationships, sharing Ambition, assertiveness, control\nAssertive, confrontational, and aggressive Timid, submissive, and tender in social\nAssertiveness in social relationships relationships\nFuture Planning, investing, and delays of\norientation individual or collective gratification Spontaneity, enjoying the present\nPerformance Encourages and rewards group No rewards and encouragement for goals;\norientation performance and excellence more relaxed in terms of achievement\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n63 Globe Dimension One Extreme Other Extreme\nEncourages and rewards individuals for Concerns for self, not sensitive, not\nHumane being fair, altruistic, friendly, generous, encouraging of social supports and\norientation caring community values\nAdapted from House et al.

The desirable attributes were viewed as characteristics that were valued and that\nfacilitated the leadership processes. Undesirable attributes were viewed as obstacles and challenges to\neffective leadership. Table 2.9 \"List of Desirable and Undesirable Leadership Attributes from the GLOBE\nResearch\" illustrates the positive and negative attributes of effective leadership.\nTable 2.5 GLOBE Clusters of Societies\nCluster Countries\nCanada, United States, Australia, Ireland, England, South Africa (White sample), New\nAnglo Zealand\nConfucian Asia Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, South Korea, Japan\nEastern Europe Greece, Hungary, Albania, Slovenia, Poland, Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan\nGermanic Europe Austria, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany-East, Germany-West\nEcuador, El Salvador, Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, Argentina, Costa Rica,\nLatin America Venezuela, Mexico\nLatin Europe Israel, Italy, Switzerland (French-speaking), Spain, Portugal, France\nMiddle East Turkey, Kuwait, Egypt, Morocco, Qatar\nNordic Europe Denmark, Finland, Sweden\nSouthern Asia Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Thailand, Iran\nSub-Saharan\nAfrica Zimbabwe, Namibia, Zambia, Nigeria, South Africa (Black sample)\nAdapted from House et al.

The significance\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n65 of the GLOBE study is that it helps leaders to understand the role of culture in leadership. By\nunderstanding one\u2019s culture, as well as that of others, it brings you to awareness of different perceptions\nof leadership and how cultures come to understand leaders. Recognizing the elements in leadership and\nculture enables you to leverage the differences that cultures create and to use that to create positive\nintercultural growth.\nTable 2.8 Leadership Behavior Profiles for Clusters\nCluster 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th\nEastern Self- Team\nEurope Autonomous protective Charismatic Oriented Humane Participative\nSelf-\nLatin America Charismatic Team protective Participative Humane Autonomous\nSelf-\nLatin Europe Charismatic Team Participative protective Humane Autonomous\nSelf-\nConfucian Asia protective Team Humane Charismatic Autonomous Participative\nSelf-\nNordic Europe Charismatic Participative Team Autonomous Humane protective\nSelf-\nAnglo Charismatic Participative Humane Team Autonomous protective\nSub-Sahara Self-\nAfrica Humane Charismatic Team Participative protective Autonomous\nSelf-\nSouthern Asia protective Charismatic Humane Team Autonomous Participative\nGermanic Self-\nEurope Autonomous Charismatic Participative Humane Team protective\nSelf-\nMiddle East protective Humane Autonomous Charismatic Team Participative\nAdapted from House et al.

It\nconsists of the shared beliefs, values, and assumptions of a group of people who learn from one\nanother and teach to others that their behaviors, attitudes, and perspectives are the correct ways\nto think, act, and feel.\n\uf0b7 Culture is a process of learning and sharing, and it is dynamic and symbolic.\n\uf0b7 Cultural issues are systemic and understanding this helps leaders to appreciate culture in its\nfullest sense.\n\uf0b7 Awareness helps to eliminate the stereotypes that are derived from cultural misunderstandings,\nwhich limit the positive ways in which culture is viewed. However, generalizations about cultures\ncan help serve as a framework for interacting with unfamiliar cultural systems.\n\uf0b7 Culture is multidimensional, consisting of multiple layers. There are five main levels\u2014national,\nregional, organizational, team, and individual\u2014that are most useful in cultural contexts.\n\uf0b7 Each cultural layer, when peeled apart, reveals the \u201croots\u201d of culture, which consist of the values,\nassumptions, and symbols of the culture. These three ground cultural systems, often making it\nhard for cultural shifts to occur.\n\uf0b7 Familiarity with Hofstede\u2019s model of value dimensions (identity, power, gender, uncertainty, and\ntime) in the workplace helps leaders to realize the impact of values and beliefs in cultural settings.\n\uf0b7 The GLOBE study of 62 societies is the most comprehensive research, to date, that analyzes how\nleadership is perceived by cultures.\n\uf0b7 Nine cultural value dimensions, including the five proposed by Hofstede in the 1980s, illustrate\nthe importance of understanding value dimensions in the context of leading.\n\uf0b7 There are six global leadership categories that emerged from the GLOBE data: charismatic, team-\noriented, participative, humane-oriented, autonomous, and self-protective.\n\uf0b7 The GLOBE data points to universally positive and undesirable attributes of leaders. All cultures\nagree that the following are negative attributes: a leader who is a loner, irritable, ruthless, asocial,\nnonexplicit, dictatorial, noncooperative, and egocentric.\n\uf0b7 Leaders have a role in creating business cultures that make employees feel valued and included\nregardless of their cultural backgrounds.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n68 Chapter 3\nCultural Intelligence Defined\nA few years ago I was invited to speak about cultural intelligence at a global women\u2019s leadership\nconference in the United Arab Emirates. Like any country I am traveling to, I made the efforts to\nlearn about the area of the world that I was going to visit. To prepare for my trip I found books that\nspoke about the cultural history and background of the country. I bought language CDs and watched\ndocumentaries about that region of the world. I also visited websites and blogs to explore what other\ntravelers had done and experienced. I know I spent hours finding information and learning about the\nculture and the people including what gestures to use and how to address someone in a business\nmeeting\u2013all the etiquettes I thought I would need in the country.\nAs a petite-sized woman traveling alone, late at night in an unfamiliar country, I was anxious to get\nto my hotel as soon as possible. Upon my arrival in the United Arab Emirates, I went through\npassport control like every passenger. When it was my turn, I handed my passport and plane ticket to\nthe man behind the counter. He nodded at me and I responded with an enthusiastic \u201cHello.\u201d Then,\nthe man looked at me for a few seconds and then looked away. In the seconds that he looked away, I\nlooked toward the direction he was facing. I was not sure what drew his attention away, but his\nattention never came back to me and my passport.\nI did not know what to do. Several thoughts were going through my head at that time. Perhaps I was\nin the wrong line? Did I do something wrong? Why is he not taking my passport? Was I supposed to\nget another form of documentation? Could something happen to me? Would I be able to call my\npeers at their hotel to let them know I arrived? Would someone be willing to come and pick me up?\nI was the last person in my line going through passport control, and every line other than my own\nseemed to be moving. As I watched traveler after traveler go through passport control, I remember\nfeeling very self-conscious and a bit worried. As I watched his attention focused on something else, I\ntried to draw it back by saying, \u201cHi!\u201d hoping I would have his attention this time. No luck.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n69 I felt my anxiety rising, mostly because of the worse-case scenario thinking I was doing. I kept telling\nmyself \u201ceverything is going to be okay\u201d although I had no idea if it was. I was not clear why the man\nin front of me was not taking my passport. I looked around for the non-verbal cues, but all I could tell\nwas that he was acting as if he did not see me. Then, I thought I would check to see if there was\nsomething wrong with my passport, and I proceeded to say, \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d No response.\nI nudged the passport forward, and he turned his attention back on me. He still did not pick up the\npassport or acknowledge me. I began to shift the backpack I was carrying on my right shoulder to\nmove the weight off, and then it dawned on me that maybe I should pass the passport to him with my\nright hand. I had read in the literature and online that in the Arab world, the left hand is considered\nunclean. Did I hand him the passport with my left hand? I may have since my right hand was\ngrabbing the handles of my backpack.\nI nudged the passport with my right hand toward him.\nThe Emirati responded by taking the passport! He stamped it and then said, \u201cHave a good stay in our\ncountry.\u201d\nWhen I reached my hotel, I could not go to sleep. My mind was replaying the scenario of the Emirati\nman and myself. How did I know what to do? What if I nudged the passport with my right hand and\nhe still did not take it? What emotions were coming up for me? What more could I have done to\nunderstand the situation? Was this really a part of Muslim culture I was experiencing or was it the\nEmirati man\u2019s individual preferences and culture?\nI will never forget this experience because it was my own cultural intelligence in action. I was trying\nto be culturally intelligent without having all the information and knowing only the details that were\nin front of me. The frustration of not knowing if what I said or did was offensive bothered me\nbecause I see myself as adaptable and respectful. And perhaps the man\u2019s reaction had nothing to do\nwith me and all to do with how he was feeling in that moment. Although I sought to learn different\nparts about the culture before traveling to the Emirates, I gained from this experience the knowledge\nthat one can never be prepared for what cultural interactions could bring in any given moment. This\nis why cultural intelligence is incredibly vital and useful as a tool; it is there to help you understand\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n70 each play-by-play action in cultural interactions. CI helps you to break down your cognitive,\nemotional, and physical reactions, helping you to understand more about yourself so that in future\ninteractions, you make different choices in how you react.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n71 3.1 What is Cultural Intelligence?\nAt the core of it, cultural intelligence is your ability to successfully adapt to unfamiliar cultural\nsettings. Peter Earley and Elaine Mosakowski defined cultural intelligence (CI) as the ability to \u201ctease\nout of a person\u2019s or group\u2019s behavior those features that would be true of all people and all groups,\nthose peculiar to this person or this group, and those that are neither universal nor\nidiosyncratic.\u201d [1] Earley et al. wrote that cultural intelligence is not just about learning new cultural\nsituations; it is creating \u201ca new framework for understanding what he or she experiences and\nsees.\u201d [2] Similarly, David Thomas and Kerr Inkson indicated that cultural intelligence is about\nbeing skilled and flexible about understanding a culture, learning more about it from your on-\ngoing interactions with it, and gradually reshaping your thinking to be more sympathetic to the\nculture and your behaviors to be more skilled and appropriate when interacting with others from\nthe culture. [3]\nThe idea of cultural intelligence is an immensely useful tool in business. It helps to bring attention to\nthe differences in thought and behaviors due to cultural factors. Consistently practicing cultural\nintelligence has been known to increase the success of multicultural team performance. Leaders who\nare culturally intelligent have awareness of how culture contributes to communication and creates\nshared learning. [4]\nTuning into Cultural Intelligence\nOn a business trip to Texas, my colleague, who had never visited the state, was surprised at the amount of\n\u201cSpanish music\u201d on the radio. Every time she found a music station or station providing information, the\nspeakers and singers spoke in Spanish. She said, \u201cI can\u2019t find any music that I can understand,\u201d and\nquickly changed to a local station that played top 40 and pop music.\nWhen I suggested that we should try listening to different music and experience the cultural shift between\nour state and another, she said, \u201cNo way. I can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying!\u201d I replied, \u201cI can\u2019t either,\nbut it\u2019s a part of the culture here and wouldn\u2019t it be interesting to be like one of the locals?\u201d Her response,\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll just stick to what I know.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n72 Cultural intelligence is like tuning into different stations, being able to adapt to one\u2019s new environment,\nand, in this case, to the style of music in this region of the United States. Like my colleague, we all have\nparticular stations that we like. Music that is familiar provides us with comfort. Tuning in to the same\nstations over and over again breeds familiarity with the songs and the types of programming broadcast by\nthe stations. We even program the stations into our car radio so as to know exactly what buttons to push if\nwe want to hear a specific music genre.\nWhen you are in a different city or state, you begin to lose the signals of your favorite stations. Try as you\nmight, the stations often do not come through. What might you do? You could find another station in that\nstate that offers the same music or information that you like. Upon finding it, you might program it so as\nto not lose the station. However, what if the radio frequencies you encounter pick up limited stations?\nLike my colleague, you might turn off the radio or change the station back to one that is familiar. Or, like\nher, you could bring your own MP3 player with your own music.\nSimilarly, when you are in unfamiliar cultural settings, you realize that the signals you are receiving are\nvastly different from your own. You are not familiar with what your new surroundings are communicating\nto you. Your first reaction is to find something familiar, and you look for cues and signs to help you adjust.\nHowever, you cannot always rely on what you know and what you can bring with you. Like my co-worker,\nbringing equipment, like an MP3 player, does not always guarantee successful integration. After many\ntries, she found out her MP3 player did not work in the rental car; she opted for turning off the radio\naltogether. In intercultural interactions, the equipment\u2014that is, our skill sets and our knowledge\u2014may\nnot be enough to cope in a new cultural environment. We need to be able to learn how to turn off or reset\nourselves to better adapt to the new situation.\n[1] Earley & Mosakowski (2004), p. 140.\n[2] Earley, Ang, & Tan (2006), p. 6.\n[3] Thomas & Inkson, (2003), p. 14.\n[4] Darlington (1996), p. 53.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n73 3.2 Cultural Intelligence Model\nCultural intelligence is a framework to help you learn to turn off your \u201ccruise control.\u201d Like a\ncomputer that has been on too long, is working too hard, or has too many programs running that\ncause it to freeze, we have to learn to reset our mental programming. Sometimes, resetting it once or\ntwice does not work; you will need to turn it off completely by taking a pause and then returning to it\nat a later time.\nCultural intelligence emphasizes three areas: metacognition and cognition, motivation, and behavior.\nMetacognition and cognition represent your ability to think, learn, and strategize. In CI, the principle\nof motivation refers to your self-efficacy and confidence, your ability to be persistent, and the\nalignment to your personal values. Behavior, in CI, is about your ability to have a repertoire of skills\nand your ability to adapt your behavior.\nThe framework for cultural intelligence consists of the following parts: knowledge, strategic thinking,\nmotivation, and behaviors. It may be helpful to think about these as\nthe ABCs of CI: Acquire, Build, Contemplate, and Do.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n74 Figure 3.1 Cultural Intelligence Model\nAcquire Knowledge\nA fundamental piece of inter- and cross-cultural interactions is the knowledge a leader has when working\nwith cultures unfamiliar and different from his or her own. Knowledge is a central tenet in intercultural\ntraining and is included in the cultural intelligence model because it is essential for any person, whether\nleading or managing, to be attentive to cultural systems. You must know how cultures are created,\ninterpreted, and shared, as well as how cultural interpretations, meaning, and symbols can impact\nbehaviors and attitudes.\nYou can think about this aspect of the model as acquire, because you need to acquire information and\nknowledge that help you to identify cultural elements at play. The acquisition of knowledge\u2014tapping into\nwhat you have stored in your memory\u2014is cognition.\nBuild Your Strategic Thinking\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n75 Once you gain knowledge about the culture, how will you use it? What parts of the knowledge obtained\nwill you use? Will they all fit, given the cultural setting? These questions address the component of\ncultural intelligence that speaks to your ability, as a leader, to strategize across cultures. It is your ability\nto build awareness of your surrounding through preparation and planning. It is often referred to as\n\u201cmetacognition.\u201d\nEarley et al. noted, \u201cFiguring out how things operate and what is appropriate in a new culture is detective\nwork using the facts of the case\u2014assemble them, order and organize them, interpret them, act on\nthem.\u201d [1] Strategic thinking is important because it is how you think about, or make sense of, the\nknowledge and use it in a way that helps you better perform and interact with different cultures. If you are\nable to understand how you learn the information and how you have processed it, this helps you to make\nsense of unfamiliar situations. Early and Peterson [2] wrote that when there is a focus on metacognition,\nthis component of CI can help people to develop and expand their behavioral repertoires.\nContemplate Your Motivation and Ability to Work with Others\nThe third element of the cultural intelligence model speaks to your ability to pay attention to your\nsurroundings as well as your responses to unfamiliar situations. It is about reflecting upon your own\ninterests, your drive, and your motivation, as well as your willingness to work through, and with, cultural\ninteractions.\nYou can think about this component of the model as contemplate because it requires you to be present\u2014to\ntake a step back, suspend your judgments and biases, reflect upon your assumptions, and listen carefully.\nIt requires that you be alert and remain aware of your cultural surroundings. As a leader, presence allows\nyou to identify the cultural scripts that are hidden and to recognize when to turn them off.\nAdapt and Perform\nRichard Carlson said that \u201ceverything we do has the potential to influence another human being\u2026the key\nelement here is not to second-guess yourself but rather to become conscious of how your life choices\ninfluence those around you.\u201d [3] Carlson speaks to our level of conscious choice in day-to-day living. When\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n76 do we choose to adapt to our environments? Because of a choice we made, what did we let go? How has\nour choice affected our beliefs and values?\nThese questions address the fourth component of cultural intelligence, which is your adaptability and\nability to perform new behaviors based on new cultural surroundings. Are you aware of how others see\nyou and how you come across to them? How do you interpret what others say, and how do you respond?\nCulturally intelligent leaders are like chameleons in social environments, changing their behaviors to\nmimic their surroundings.\n[1] Earley et al. (2006), p. 27.\n[2] Earley & Peterson (2004), p. 105.\n[3] Carlson (2005), p. 130.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n77 3.3 What Makes Cultural Intelligence Unique?\nHoward Gardner [1] popularized the idea that intelligence is more than cognitive capacity\u2014that\nhuman potential cannot be limited to cognitive intelligence the way it is described and defined in\nsociety. You can think about cultural intelligence as another form of intelligence. People with this\nparticular intelligence have the ability to steer their way through unfamiliar cultural interactions;\nthey do this in what seems to others as an effortless manner. This does not mean that culturally\nintelligent people are more intelligent overall than others; rather, those who are not skilled in this\nintelligence may need to adopt a different approach toward learning and improving their cultural\nintelligence.\nAccording to Earley and Peterson, cultural intelligence is a significant improvement over existing\napproaches because it \u201cprovides an integrated approach to training dealing with knowledge and\nlearning, motivation and behavior, and is built upon a unifying psychological model of cultural\nadaptation rather than the piecemeal and country-specific approach in training.\u201d [2] David Thomas\nand Kerr Inkson [3] wrote that, compared to emotional and social intelligence, cultural intelligence\ntheory includes the influence of cultural factors and their impact in intercultural interactions.\nEmotional intelligence is one\u2019s ability and capacity to identify, assess, and manage one\u2019s emotions as\nwell as others\u2019 emotions. Although extremely important, emotional intelligence \u201cpresumes a degree\nof familiarity within a culture and context that may exist across many cultures for a given\nindividual.\u201d[4] Similarly, the social cues picked up and used by someone with high social intelligence\u2014\nthat is, the ability and capacity to sense one\u2019s inner state, feelings, and thoughts in relation to one\u2019s\nsocial environment, and react appropriately in this environment for social success [5]\u2014differs from\nculture to culture.\nEarley and Peterson argue that adaptation is a requirement when one enters new cultural contexts,\nand cultural intelligence provides the theoretical background for understanding how one would need\nto adjust, adapt, or reinvent oneself based on the culture and the situation. [6] Someone with high\nemotional and social intelligence is not guaranteed to be culturally intelligent, although having those\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n78 skills can make it easier for them to learn about cultural intelligence. This is illustrated in the\nfollowing case study.\nMartha works as a program director for a large nonprofit that directs volunteer programs. Her co-workers\ndescribe her as, \u201cpersonable, outgoing, empathic, and caring.\u201d Whenever there is conflict or unsettled\nbusiness, she is the \u201cgo to person\u201d for helping her colleagues work out their issues. Her ability to be\nempathetic enables her to understand others\u2019 thoughts and feelings as well as their intentions.\nWhen Martha gets upset or frustrated, she \u201ctakes a pause\u201d or will back away from the issue or person until\nshe can get a hold of her emotions. If Martha is asked how she manages her emotions, she replies that\nmeditation and exercise help her to regulate how she feels from moment to moment. She\u2019s even led\nagency wide sessions on self-care and exercise.\nVolunteers who work for Martha love that she cares about their needs. During workshops and events she\nintroduces volunteers to one another, helping them to learn about and get to know each other. Martha is\nalso very attuned to those around her by listening and observing, which makes her a great program\ndirector for volunteers.\nMartha\u2019s emotional and social intelligences are high, which makes it difficult for Lorraine, Martha\u2019s direct\nsupervisor, to understand why Martha has such challenges working with people of cultural groups\ndifferent than her own. Martha, as her jovial self, is always kind and thoughtful, but sometimes she will\nsay culturally inappropriate things, not aware that she\u2019s said them.\nOne of the volunteers who is Southeast Asian has noted, \u201cI like Martha but it seems like she just doesn\u2019t\nunderstand me. Like the time I had to cancel my tutoring shift. No one was watching my sister\u2019s baby so I\nhad to watch her. I told Martha and she was real nice and understanding, but I feel that she\ndidn\u2019t really understand that I have an obligation to my family before this volunteer job. I had to explain\nto her that this is what it\u2019s like in my culture, that family comes first. Then, she nodded and understood.\u201d\nIn this case, although Martha is empathic, she does not understand that the volunteer has very\nspecific cultural needs. Her empathy is not viewed as authentic because Martha does not understand,\nnor does she pick up on, the cultural cues, thus leading the volunteer to feel the way she\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n79 feels. Empathy is a good foundation for intercultural relationships, but awareness of cultural nuances\nis critical for making the connection.\nThe following describes other ways in which scholars and practitioners believe cultural intelligence is\ndifferent from other approaches:\n\uf0b7 Cultural intelligence is a growing field that is continuously being researched and tested in many\nsocieties. A search on the Internet for the word \u201ccultural intelligence\u201d yields over 2.7 million hits.\nWhen searching for academic papers and scholarship, the word yields almost 1.5 million hits.\nOther intercultural approaches do not yield as much universal appeal as cultural intelligence.\n\uf0b7 Cultural intelligence demands that leaders gather more than knowledge of cultural facts. It is\nawareness of how culture works, of the values and beliefs that ground a person\u2019s thinking and\nmotivation, and of exploring behavioral intelligence.\n\uf0b7 Cultural intelligence emphasizes a circular path, not a linear one; this means that, over time, one\nwill continue to learn and their cultural intelligence will expand. It is not a step-by-step process\nthat culminates in an \u201cultimate outcome.\u201d Rather, through cultural intelligence, one learns more\nabout him- or herself and his or her ability to interact with different cultures. There is always\nroom for improvement and development in cultural intelligence.\n\uf0b7 Cultural intelligence does not speak to specific cultures. Cultural intelligence is a broad approach\nthat looks at developing a set of skills, as well as awareness and knowledge, that help you to adapt\nand interact with multiple cultures.\n[1] Gardner (1983).\n[2] Earley & Peterson (2004), p. 101.\n[3] Thomas & Inkson (2003).\n[4] Earley & Peterson (2004), p. 105\n[5] Goleman (2006), pp. 83\u201384.\n[6] Earley & Peterson (2004).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n80 3.4 The Labyrinth of Cultural Intelligence\nWe have not even to risk the adventure alone\u2026the labyrinth is thoroughly known. We have only to\nfollow the thread of the hero path\u2026and where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves.\nWhere we had thought to travel outward, we will come to the center of our existence. And where we had\nthought to be alone, we will be with all the world.\n- Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth\nLabyrinths often serve as metaphors for personal journeys into the self and back into the world. In a\nlabyrinth, there is one path to the center, and that same path leads you out. You make the choice to\nenter the path and start a journey. You make the choice to continue the journey or to end it by\nretracing your steps to the place you entered.\nYou can think about your journey into cultural intelligence as entering a labyrinth. It is not a maze;\nrather, it is journey that brings you to a deeper awareness of yourself and your place in the world. In\na labyrinth, you find yourself walking around short curves, long curves, around edges of the circle,\ngetting closer to the center. As you do so, you may feel a variety of emotions and thought: hesitation,\nconfidence, motivation, ease, caution, or reflection. In the labyrinth, we become the observer of these\nthoughts and emotions. As Carlson noted, \u201cWe can simply step back and watch the show. It\u2019s really\njust like watching a movie on the screen.\u201d [1]\nThe labyrinth has long served as a metaphor of change and growth. Walking the labyrinth is a time of\nexploration and discovery. Careful listening and the willingness to take risks, and to challenge\nyourself, lead you to a transformation. This transformation encompasses a new, expansive vision of\npossibilities in your world. It serves as a container for your experiences in life: fun and play,\ndisappointment and sadness, grief and loss, joy and prosperity, success and failure. When you look at\nthe labyrinth as a metaphor for your cultural intelligence journey, you will see that your path is\nsometimes shared with others, and, at times, it is yours alone.\nAs Joseph Campbell noted, everyone goes through a psychological transformation that brings them\nto a more fulfilling life. [2] Cultural intelligence is a process and a tool to help you evolve, to help you\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n81 take the risks required when in unfamiliar cultural interactions. When applied, you will notice that\nyou have gained a new consciousness of your place in the world.\n[1] Carlson (2005), p. 50.\n[2] Campbell (1988).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n82 3.5 Chapter Summary\n\uf0b7 Cultural intelligence is the ability to adapt successfully to unfamiliar cultural settings.\n\uf0b7 There are three elements to cultural intelligence: metacognition and cognition, motivation, and\nbehavior.\n\uf0b7 Cultural intelligence can be expressed as the ABCs of CI: acquire (knowledge), build (strategic\nthinking), contemplate (motivation), and do (behavior).\n\uf0b7 Cultural intelligence is more comprehensive than emotional and social intelligences.\n\uf0b7 People who have high emotional and social intelligences do not necessarily have high cultural\nintelligence.\n\uf0b7 CI is more than knowledge-gathering; it does not speak to one specific culture.\n\uf0b7 Your journey into cultural intelligence can be seen as entering a labyrinth. Labyrinths serve as\nmetaphors for personal journeys that lead to transformation and change.\n\uf0b7 Practicing and applying cultural intelligence principles enables you to learn more about yourself\nand your relationship to the world.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n83 Chapter 4\nThinking About Thinking\nCultural strategic thinking is your ability to think and solve problems in specific ways when you are\nin unfamiliar cultural settings. To understand cultural strategic thinking, it is important for you to\ncomprehend the two elements that make up this foundational piece of cultural\nintelligence: cognition and metacognition.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n84 4.1 What is Cognition?\nCognition is generally thought of as your ability to process information. As related to culture, you can\nthink about it as the complete knowledge and experience you have gained about cultural situations\nand your interactions within those situations. Additionally, how you have thought or processed this\ninformation is stored in your memory. Your ability to retrieve this stored information is defined as\ncognitive ability.\nFor example, I was conducting a workshop on cultural intelligence for educators, and one of the\nsenior managers raised a question about proper etiquette in Southeast Asian cultures, particularly\nLao and Hmong, that were present in her school district. She said, \u201cI heard from one of my\ncolleagues that it\u2019s considered rude if you touched or patted a child\u2019s head; that it\u2019s sacred. I tell my\nstaff never to do this. Am I telling them the right cultural information?\u201d\nI replied that, yes, in some Southeast Asian cultures, touching or patting someone on the head is\nconsidered rude. \u201cBut, you have to realize that cultural information may not be true for every\nSoutheast Asian child or parent you meet. Your awareness of this fact and your experiences related to\nthis fact is a good thing to recall, but what if your new situation doesn\u2019t fit into your past experiences\nand what you know? What do you do?\u201d\nWhat I pointed out to her was that her awareness of this cultural fact was not enough. Earley and\nPeterson [1] stated that providing training in specific cognitive knowledge for multiple cultures is\nimpractical. What is critical is equipping a manager with metacognitive skills so that, with time and\nexperience, he or she can acquire new information concerning the cultural issues present in his or\nher team. With cultural intelligence, when the information you have does not fit a new situation, you\nhave to be able to take in new information and reformulate it. Given this new information, you need\nto be flexible enough to reorganize how you think about the situation and the cultural fact(s) you\nhave stored in your memory.\nThroughout my educational and consulting sessions, I meet with people who are most concerned\nabout \u201cgetting cultural facts and information correct.\u201d By this I mean they are interested in \u201cwhat\nthey can and can\u2019t do,\u201d or \u201cmaking sure they act within the boundaries of proper behaviors.\u201d Some\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n85 even want a \u201c10 commandments of cultural etiquette.\u201d As a result, most people end up with cultural\nfacts and information that help them understand the culture, but not the ability to work with, and\nadapt to, the culture.\nThe reality is, when you are working on a multinational team or supervising and leading a\nmultinational staff, you need to have a higher level of thinking (cognition). This is where cultural\nstrategic thinking really matters and where metacognition becomes important.\n[1] Earley & Peterson (2004), p. 104.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n86 4.2 What is Metacognition?\nMetacognition refers to \u201cthinking about thinking\u201d and was introduced as a concept in by John Flavell,\nwho is typically seen as a founding scholar of the field. Flavell said that metacognition is the\nknowledge you have of your own cognitive processes (your thinking). [1] It is your ability to control\nyour thinking processes through various strategies, such as organizing, monitoring, and adapting.\nAdditionally, it is your ability to reflect upon the tasks or processes you undertake and to select and\nutilize the appropriate strategies necessary in your intercultural interactions.\nMetacognition is considered a critical component of successful learning. It involves self-regulation\nand self-reflection of strengths, weaknesses, and the types of strategies you create. It is a necessary\nfoundation in culturally intelligent leadership because it underlines how you think through a\nproblem or situation and the strategies you create to address the situation or problem.\nMany people become accustomed to having trainers and consultants provide them with knowledge\nabout cultures to the point where they are dependent on the coach, mentor, trainer, or consultant.\nHowever, they need to learn to be experts in cultural situations themselves through metacognitive\nstrategies such as adapting, monitoring, self-regulation, and self-reflection. Culturally intelligent\nleaders can use metacognition to help themselves and to train themselves to think through their\nthinking.\nMetacognition is broken down into three components: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive\nexperience, and metacognitive strategies. Each of these is discussed in the following sections.\nMetacognitive Knowledge\nMetacognitive knowledge involves (a) learning processes and your beliefs about how you learn and how\nyou think others learn, (b) the task of learning and how you process information, and (c)\nthe strategies you develop and when you will use them. Let us say you have to learn a new language in 6\nmonths. Here is how you would think about it, using metacognitive knowledge:\n\uf0b7 Learning Process: I am good at learning new languages and I think I can do this in the time\nperiod I have been given.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n87 \uf0b7 Task of Learning: To complete this task, I will need to think about the following:\no How soon can I get information to start learning the language?\no How long will it take me to learn the language?\no What information is available to me to learn this new language?\no Is this language similar to a language I have learned before?\no Will I be able to learn the language in time?\no How hard will it be for me to learn this language?\no What do I need to do to learn the language?\n\uf0b7 The Strategies: I think learning this new language is going to take me 12 months, but I only have\n6 months to prepare. I better find other ways to me meet this goal. I think I will find out if there is\nan accelerated language class that I can take. Maybe I should consider hiring a private tutor, or\nmaybe I will just focus on learning the basics of the language.\nMetacognitive Experience\nArnold Bennett, a British writer, said that one cannot have knowledge without having emotions. [2] In\nmetacognition, there are feelings and emotions present that are related to the goals and tasks of learning.\nThese components of metacognition speaks to metacognitive experience, which is your internal response\nto learning. Your feelings and emotions serve as a feedback system to help you understand your progress\nand expectations, and your comprehension and connection of new information to the old, among other\nthings.\nWhen you learn a new language, for example, you may recall memories, information, and earlier\nexperiences in your life to help you solve the task of learning a new language. In doing this, your internal\nresponses (metacognitive experience) could be frustration, disappointment, happiness, or satisfaction.\nEach of these internal responses can affect the task of learning a new language and determine your\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n88 willingness to continue. Critical to metacognition is the ability to deliberately foster a positive attitude and\npositive feelings toward your learning.\nMetacognitive Strategies\nMetacognitive strategies are what you design to monitor your progress related to your learning and the\ntasks at hand. It is a mechanism for controlling your thinking activities and to ensure you are meeting\nyour goals. Metacognitive strategies for learning a new language can include the following:\n\uf0b7 monitoring whether you understand the language lessons;\n\uf0b7 recognizing when you fail to comprehend information communicated to you in the new language;\n\uf0b7 identifying strategies that help you to improve your comprehension;\n\uf0b7 adjusting your pace for learning the information (for example, studying for 2 hours, rather than 1\nhour, every day);\n\uf0b7 maintaining the attitude necessary to ensure you complete the lessons in a timely manner;\n\uf0b7 creating a check-in system at the end of each week to make certain you understand what you have\nlearned.\nAs one business manager of a Fortune 300 company told me,\nUnderstanding cultural strategic thinking is like this: When I work with people of different\ncultures, this is a framework and approach to help me understand how I think when I work with\nthem. It helps me to recognize the cultural experiences I\u2019ve had, and to identify preconceived\nnotions I might have about their culture, whether it\u2019s race/ethnicity, social culture, age group\u2014\nyou name it. Cultural strategic thinking forces me to create experiences and new learning that\nhelps me to accomplish my objectives as a global manager. [3]\nIndividuals like this leader are good at applying strategies that focus their attention on the goal at hand.\nThey search for, and derive meaning from, cultural interactions and situations, and they adapt themselves\nto the situation when things do not pan out as they expected. Culturally intelligent leaders also monitor\nand direct their own learning processes. They have established a high motivation for learning the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n89 metacognitive process, either because they know it is a benefit or because others tell them it is beneficial\nto them.\nKnowledge of factual information and basic skills provides a foundation for developing metacognition.\nMetacognition enables leaders to master information and solve problems more easily. When a leader has\nmastered the basic skills needed for intercultural interactions, they can actively engage in the interaction\nbecause they do not have to pay attention to the other dynamics and demands of the situation. Culturally\nintelligent leaders are able to practice metacognition, and they are not afraid to use it in their everyday\nlife.\nFor those who lack basic intercultural skills, it is more difficult for them to engage in the interaction. They\nare more occupied with finding the \u201cright information,\u201d the \u201cright skills,\u201d and the \u201cright facts\u201d needed to\nsolve the problem. In such situations, these types of leaders spend little time developing their\nmetacognitive skills, and the result is likely an inefficient solution to a problem. Developing a laundry list\nor checklist of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts will not assist leaders in improving their cultural intelligence.\n[1] Flavell (1979).\n[2] Bennett (1933).\n[3] G. Menefee (personal communication, May 12, 2010).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n90 4.3 Techniques for Developing Strategic Thinking\nHow can you improve your strategic thinking? Basic strategies for improving thinking include (a)\nconnecting new information with what you already know, (b) selecting your thinking strategies\ncarefully and intentionally, and (c) planning, monitoring, and evaluating your thinking strategies and\nprocesses.\nConnecting New Information\nStrategic thinking is \u201cthinking about thinking.\u201d It is being conscious of your thinking processes, such as\nhow you have gathered and organized the information and experience in your memory (old information),\nand then how you reorganize it (new information) to fit a new situation. You have to connect the new\ninformation to what you already know in order to help make sense of what actions to take. You can do this\nby identifying what you know and what you do not know about a cultural situation. Here is an exercise to\nhelp you identify old and new information. Take a sheet a paper and draw a line down the middle of the\nsheet to create two columns. At the top of the left column, write, \u201cWhat I know,\u201d and at the top of the right\ncolumn, write, \u201cWhat I want to learn.\u201d As you research, explore, and interact with a cultural situation,\npeople, or information, you will learn to clarify, revise, verify, or expand your understanding of the\nsituation.\nLet us look at the example of Betsy, who is a product manager for a local distributor of processed foods\nand snacks. With a growing Hispanic population that has an increasingly large purchasing power in the\nUnited States, her company wants to expand into the market and seize on this opportunity and potential\nfor growth. This is not a new market for the business, but it requires that her team think strategically\nabout what they know and do not know about this consumer base.\nTable 4.1 Identification of Knowledge Gaps\nWhat I Know What I Want to Learn\nBetween the years 1991\u20132013, the projected growth of Hispanic Differences in lifestyles among Hispanic\npurchasing power is 560%. groups.\nReasons for immigration or coming to the\nHispanics are the largest minority group in the United States. United States.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n91 What I Know What I Want to Learn\nCultural etiquette in doing business with\nBy 2020, the U.S. Hispanic population will triple. Hispanics.\nHistory of Hispanic culture in the United\nFamily is central to Hispanic communities. States.\nA large percentage of Hispanic families are from low-income\nfamilies.\nNext, Betty and her team will need identify the strategies that will help them to be more intentional with\ntheir work.\nSelecting Intentional Thinking Strategies\nBased on this exercise, Betty has identified strategies that will connect new information to the old in the\nfollowing ways:\nFigure 4.1 Creating Intentional Strategies\nBy connecting old information with the new, Betty is making conscious choices and decisions about what\nshe knows and what she does not know. This sets her up with strategies that are most appropriate for her.\nStrategic thinking is most useful when you find strategies that work appropriately for your level of\nknowledge, building upon what you know. As indicated earlier in the chapter, if this new knowledge is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n92 basic information and Betty does not have this, she can be easily distracted, which may create\ninterruptions in her learning and practice of strategic thinking.\nPlanning, Monitoring, and Evaluating\nAs Betty collects information related to her actions, she will add or revise her strategies, as needed,\nbecause her knowledge base has grown and what was \u201cnew information\u201d at one time is now old\ninformation. Betty will put in place strategies that help her to monitor her progress toward her goal as\nwell as to evaluate how she thinks about each strategy. Because the information is new to her, and if the\ninformation is basic knowledge that she needs, she will need to pay attention to her mind\u2019s ability to be\neasily distracted. When she is aware of this, she can retrain her brain to identify the distraction and then\nrefocus on her goals. There are a variety of strategies she can use to plan, monitor, and evaluate her\nprogress.\nOne strategy Betty has employed is to create the time and space with her team to discuss her cultural\nexperiences. This allows her to process, out loud, the knowledge she has obtained and forces her to think\nabout her thinking, that is, her metacognition. Because she puts this strategy in place, she can understand\nwhat her mind is processing during her learning, and she is then able to identify and focus on her\nstrengths and improve upon her weaknesses. When she does this with a group, her peers help her to learn\nabout her thinking while she helps them to learn about their learning processes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n93 4.4 Cultural Strategic Thinking Techniques\nThe basics of developing and practicing cultural strategic thinking are to (a) connect new\ninformation to the old, (b) select the appropriate strategies, and then (c) plan, monitor, and evaluate\nthe strategies you have put in place. This section of the chapter provides ideas that will help you to\nincrease your cultural strategic thinking.\nPeer Learning\nA strategy that is often employed in the practice of cultural strategic thinking is to create peer-\nlearning opportunities to explore cultural interactions and resolve cultural problems. Doing this provides\nyou with a language for how you process cultural interactions and problems, and your peers can help you\nto create that language and help solve the problems. As a leader, this is a great way of providing a model\nfor those who have difficulty with cultural strategic thinking. It does so by sharing with them a language\nand a process, and by helping to point out the cultural strategic thinking pieces of the process, which can\nbe done by asking and clarifying the situation for them. Think about it as playing cultural detective: You\nask your peers questions, and they clarify the information for you, and when they ask you questions, you\nclarify your thinking process for them.\nWriting Your Experiences\nA useful tool I have used in my workshops and classes is writing down experiences and thoughts related to\na cultural situation. I encourage you to write down your emotions and feelings, the ambiguities and\ninconsistencies, and the challenges and successes of working interculturally. Your writing serves as a\nreflection of your thinking processes and how you have dealt with, or how you could not deal with, the\nprocess. It also serves as a memory of your experiences, which you can later refer back to and learn from.\nGaining Cultural Knowledge\nIn gaining cultural knowledge, it is very helpful to get into the habit of checking your facts and knowledge\nabout a culture. You can do this by using multiple sources and venues. If you come across a situation in\nwhich a cultural fact seems to contradict what you know, take the time to learn about the difference and\nthe nuances related to that cultural fact. Using that cultural situation as a \u201cKodak moment,\u201d take the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n94 opportunity to reread the picture to see if you really understood how that cultural fact was used. In your\nreview of the situation, you may need to research unfamiliar terms or gestures used, or you may need to\nbreak down the picture and rebuild it, step by step, to understand if you really understood the whole\npicture.\nThinking, Being, and Staying Positive\nEssential in cultural strategic thinking is your ability to conjure and be positive about your learning\nexperiences. Someone who holds a negative perspective about, or who had a negative experience, working\nwith different cultural groups will continue to have difficulty working with the groups. Negative attitudes\nand impressions will hinder your work. You have to think positively about a situation, and you need to be\nand stay positive, maintaining a positive energy and attitude throughout. I have certainly come across\nleaders who have attended my sessions because \u201cleadership told them they had to,\u201d and it affects their\nlearning environment in a negative way and often interrupts the learning of their peers. Your ability to be\na culturally intelligent leader depends on your willingness to maintain a positive attitude.\nFinding a Coach or Mentor\nAlong the lines of processing your cultural situations out loud, it would be helpful to find a coach or\nmentor that can help you analyze your thinking. In cultural strategic thinking, it is important to talk about\nwhat you will do or what you have to do. Some people will talk to themselves; others find it helpful to have\nsomeone to talk to. As in peer learning, talking to someone else gives you the opportunity to break down\nyour thinking processes.\nBeing an Observer\nOne of the best things to do in developing cultural strategic thinking is to learn to be an observer. Through\nobservation and active listening, you pick up what you normally do not see. Observation is acquired\nthrough day-to-day activities in your life by making a conscious decision to be open and alert. Pay\nattention to the verbal and nonverbal cues of various situations; look around your environment and note\nthe various symbols and artifacts. Culturally intelligent leaders must have excellent observation skills,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n95 never failing to hear and see the tangible and intangible. You can do this by reminding yourself or by\nsetting goals centered around the following actions:\n\uf0b7 Listen with an open mind\n\uf0b7 Be open to new ideas\n\uf0b7 Suspend judgments of people and their beliefs\n\uf0b7 Ask people questions\n\uf0b7 Silently ask yourself questions\n\uf0b7 Be open to experiences that are unfamiliar\nActive Listening\nActive listening is your ability to understand, interpret, reflect, and respond to what you have heard. It is a\ncritical skill in cultural intelligence because the behavior acknowledges that you have really heard what\nanother person has said. Active listening focuses your mind on the speaker, and, if done repeatedly and\nsuccessfully, you are able to build trust and a relationship with others. It can facilitate an effective cultural\ninteraction with less conflict, confusion, and frustration. Practicing to be an active listener is making a\nconscious choice about your responses to others. Because cultural intelligence is intentional, you are also\nbetter able to regulate your emotions and feelings.\nChanging Your Questions\nMarilee Adams [1] proposes that when you change your questions in any given situation, this allows you to\nchange your thinking. There are two types of questions: questions that involve judgments and questions\nthat involve learning. We ask both types of questions, and we choose which ones to ask in any given\nsituation. Asking questions in a different way provides us with another perspective.\nTable 4.2 Judger vs. Learner Questions\nJudger Learner\nWhat\u2019s wrong? What works?\nWho\u2019s to blame? What am I responsible for?\nHow can I prove I\u2019m right? What are the facts?\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n96 Judger Learner\nHow can I protect my turf? What\u2019s the big picture?\nHow can I be in control? What are my choices?\nHow could I lose? What\u2019s useful about this?\nHow could I get hurt? What can I learn?\nWhy is that person so clueless and frustrating? What is the other person feeling, needing, and wanting?\nWhy bother? What\u2019s possible?\nNote. Adapted from Marilee G. Adams, 2004, Change your questions, change your life: 7 powerful tools\nfor life and work, San Francisco, CA: Berrett-Koehler, p. 49.\nCultural strategic thinking may seem overwhelming at first, but as with any new learning, you need to\nbreak your plan into smaller steps that will help you to accomplish your goals. When you get into the habit\nof cultural strategic thinking, you will begin thinking on an unconscious level and not even recognize that\nyou are using strategic thinking. You will notice it when others marvel or comment at your ability to\neffectively manage cultural interactions.\nEarley and Peterson [2] wrote that learning about a new culture requires putting all the pieces of a pattern\ntogether when you do not know the totality of what that whole picture should look like. Cultural strategic\nthinking is essential because it is this higher strategic thinking that enables you to process the new\ninformation and reinterpret it in a new situation. Cultural strategic thinking helps you to discard what you\nthink you know and to apply new information concerning what the situation could be. By training your\nmind to think at a higher level, you create new maps of cultural situations, which help you to function\nmore effectively.\n[1] Adams (2004).\n[2] Earley & Peterson (2004).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n97 4.5 Chapter Summary\n\uf0b7 Leaders must be aware of how they process information related to culture and their ability to\nthink about this thinking, which is called metacognition.\n\uf0b7 Metacognition is an essential core of successful learning, and leaders who lack the basic\nknowledge about working with cultures will have more challenges in their ability to be culturally\nintelligent.\n\uf0b7 Culturally intelligent leaders create strategies that help them focus on the goal of their cultural\ninteractions. They use feedback from the situation and adapt it to create a new picture, while\ncreating new learning patterns for themselves.\n\uf0b7 Strategies that can help leaders build their strategic thinking include peer learning, coaching and\nmentoring, reflecting on their thinking processes in a journal or book, and being an observer and\nactive listener.\n\uf0b7 Strategic thinking techniques address the basic development skills necessary in metacognition:\nconnection of new information to old, intentionally selecting the appropriate strategies necessary\nfor that situation, and planning, monitoring, and evaluating the strategies and one\u2019s progress.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n98 Chapter 5\nI Think I Can and I Will\nWhy is it that some people are more willing and eager to work through intercultural challenges, while\nothers seem unmotivated, disinterested, unengaged? Why do some people demonstrate high levels of\nconfidence, while others are anxious, feel insecure, or shy away from the challenges? The ability to\nmeet your goals is your self-efficacy; how you manage your confidence and your emotions is\nemotional intelligence; and your willingness to reflect and consider your surroundings is called\nmindfulness. In this chapter of the book, these three concepts will be discussed in relationship to\ncultural intelligence.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n99 5.1 What is Self-Efficacy?\nSelf-efficacy, as defined by Albert Bandura, [1] represents your perception of your abilities to meet a goal\nyou have set for yourself. It is similar to self-confidence. Self-efficacy is a foundational component in\ncultural intelligence. For the past 25 years, scholars have researched this topic and the strategies that\nleaders can use to encourage higher levels of efficacy in their employees.\nPeople with lower self-efficacy will have challenges throughout intercultural processes because they do\nnot believe that they will be able to solve the problem. They do not feel they have the skills needed to work\nthrough the issues. Conversely, leaders who have higher levels of self-efficacy believe they can overcome\nobstacles, whether difficult or not. They have an easier time engaging in problem solving and finding\nstrategic approaches for solving the issues before them.\nTable 5.1 Self-efficacy Perspectives About Unfamiliar Cultural Settings\nHigh Self-Efficacy Perspective About Unfamiliar Low Self-Efficacy Perspective About Unfamiliar\nCultural Settings Cultural Settings\nThe task is to master unfamiliar settings The task is \u201ctoo big for me\u201d to handle\nSets higher commitment to goals and process No commitment to goals and process\nInternal motivation to work diligently Motivation is decreased; little to no effort\n\u201cIf I fail, I\u2019ll try again\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too stressful, complicated, and frustrating.\u201d\nFocus on success and removing obstacles Focus on obstacles and challenges\nVisualize positive experiences and outcomes Visualize negative experiences and outcomes\n[1] Bandura (1974).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n100 5.2 The Role of Self-Efficacy in Cultural Intelligence\nAs a leader working with different and unfamiliar cultures, your self-efficacy determines how you\nthink, feel, and behave in cultural situations. It is your beliefs about what you can and cannot do. It is\nyour confidence level in intercultural situations and the results that it has on your ability to adapt to\nanother culture. It is your belief that you have the ability to work through cultural issues that can\ncontribute to your perseverance in daunting, challenging situations.\nIf you have a high level of self-efficacy, you are not afraid to take on cultural challenges. Instead, you\nperceive the tasks involved as if they are something to be mastered. Your belief stirs up an internal\nmotivation for you to be successful and to fully engage in the problem. You are more likely to set\nchallenging goals and diligently work through activities. You are also more apt to maintain a\ncommitment to the process and the goals. When the going gets tough, you keep on going because of\nyour perseverance and resiliency. Take, for example, the case of Jerry and Mingxia:\nJerry works in a large university and has managed the day-to-day operations of the study abroad center\nfor three years. Because of the focus on studying abroad, many of the students who work in the center are\nfrom outside the United States. Most recently, Jerry hired a student from China for a work study position\ncoordinating front desk activities. Jerry has enjoyed working with Mingxia thus far, but he has noticed\nthat when he needs tasks to be accomplished, she doesn\u2019t give him a definite \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and sometimes\nprovides an ambiguous response to his questions. He\u2019s quickly realizing that when she says \u201cyes,\u201d it means\nshe understood him but it doesn\u2019t mean she agrees. At first he is frustrated, but that frustration gives way\nto interest and fascination about cultural differences. He\u2019s had to sit down with her several times to\ndiscuss the tasks, but he approaches the conversation as a learning opportunity for him and her. He\nrealizes that managing this cultural interaction is necessary for the work of the department. He has found\nthat even though it takes more effort to build cultural understanding, he has seen it pay off. The other day,\nMingxia brought in her friends who were interested in working with the center because they heard it was a\ngreat working environment and that he was a great boss.\nJerry\u2019s perception of cultural challenges was to change them into opportunities; he adapted to the\nsituation at hand. This is a vastly different response than what would be observed in a person with a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n101 lower self-efficacy. These individuals tend to doubt their abilities in unfamiliar cultural settings. They\ntend to avoid challenging situations and often visualize potential failures and setbacks. Individuals\nwith low self-efficacy attribute their failures to not having the right competencies or information for\nthe situation, whereas those who have high self-efficacy attribute failures to not putting in the right\namount of efforts required.\nUsing the CI model in Figure 3.1 \"Cultural Intelligence Model\", Jerry can think about this situation in\nthis way:\nAcquire: Jerry needs to acquire cultural knowledge to help him understand the situation better. He\nalready knows from his interactions with Mingxia that language, particularly responding with \u201cyes\u201d\nand \u201cno,\u201d may not be productive in this case. He also knows that Mingxia is from China and has\nconnected his department with future employees. Jerry also could learn more about students from\nChina and in particular, how they like to work with someone who is older than them.\nBuild: In this situation, Jerry can use what he knows and what he would like know to create new\nways to interact with Mingxia. He may have to try the strategies and test them out. A culturally\nintelligent leader would think about how he could plan, monitor, and evaluate his strategies. During\nthe process, he learns what works for Mingxia and what does not. For example, Jerry may want to try\nasking Mingxia questions that are not closed ended or require \u201cyes/no\u201d responses.\nContemplate: Along with his strategies, he may remind himself to pay attention to Mingxia\u2019s verbal\nand non-verbal cues. He could try either or both of these strategies, paying attention to his\nsurroundings\u2013both the visible and invisible pieces of culture; as he receives a response, he will adapt\nas needed. During the contemplation stage, Jerry can choose to suspend his judgments. When he\nnotices he has judgments or a negative emotion is present, he can take a step back to listen and\nrecognize what cultural scripts are occurring.\nDo: As he interacts with Mingxia on a daily basis, he can learn to apply the fourth principle of CI. He\ncan do this by asking himself how he might appear to Mingxia. Is he too authoritative? Too\naccommodating? Did he use words that were unclear? Was he too direct? These questions can help\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n102 Jerry to use CI principles on a daily basis, and as a result, he learns more about himself and builds\nhis self-efficacy.\nJerry\u2019s self-efficacy helps him to be a better culturally intelligent leader. When doubt is present in\nindividuals it detracts from one\u2019s efforts. People with lower self-efficacy give up more easily and\nlower their expectations and goals. They see situations as not only uncomfortable but also, in some\ncases, threatening. Avoiding uncomfortable and threatening situations is a top priority for these\nindividuals because it produces more anxiety, stress, disorientation, and frustration. Unfamiliar\ncultural situations become stressful and can be depressing. The following is an example of an\nAmerican educator assigned to work with an Iraqi family:\nMelissa is meeting Ashraf\u2019s parents to discuss his progress in class. This is the first time she is meeting his\nparents who have emigrated from the Middle East recently. When they arrive late to the meeting, she\ngreets the father by offering to shake his hand, as common in American society. He looks puzzled and\nshakes her hand. Then, Melissa turns to the mother and proceeds to shake her hand. Ashraf\u2019s mother\nlooks at Melissa, very confused, and then looks at her husband. A few seconds pass, but eventually she\nreaches out to shake Melissa\u2019s hand.\nDuring the conversation with Ashraf\u2019s parents, Melissa asks both parents questions about Ashraf\u2019s home\nlife. She wants to get a sense of how Ashraf is using the information he has learned in class in his home\nenvironment. Throughout the meeting, Melissa senses that the father is becoming more impatient and\nsuspicious, and she is uncertain as to why. She notices that the father dominates the conversation and\nresponds to the questions she poses to the mother. He also seems evasive when responding to her.\nMelissa is beginning to feel very frustrated with the father. She finds herself repeating a lot of what she\u2019s\nsaid and explaining to the parents the reason for the meeting. Halfway through the meeting she knows she\nisn\u2019t going to accomplish what she initially set out to do. She\u2019s dreading a second meeting with the family,\nand she\u2019s becoming more and more impatient with the father. Why would he treat his wife like that?\nDoesn\u2019t he realize that she can answer for herself? For the rest of the meeting, Melissa loses her focus and\nfinds herself thinking about other things. The meeting ends earlier than scheduled, but she\u2019s more than\nhappy that the meeting is over.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n103 After the meeting, Melissa shares the experience with her colleagues. She says, \u201cThe dad was always\ninterrupting and the mom was really quiet. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s scared to disagree with him. Now, I have\nto meet them again because I didn\u2019t even get what I needed from them. This second meeting better not be\na waste of my time. It\u2019s not like we have the luxury in this job to meet parents whenever they want.\u201d\nMelissa\u2019s thoughts and actions revealed her stress and her level of discomfort with the situation.\nBecause this is the first time Melissa has met with a Middle Eastern family, she does not know the\nproper cultural etiquette. She may not be aware of the cultural information she needs ahead of time\nto work with the family, which may explain why she does not pick up on the mother\u2019s hesitation\nwhen shaking hands. Additionally, Melissa uses judgments based on her cultural values system to\nexplain the uncertainty she feels. For example, she finds the father to be suspicious and evasive. How\ndoes she know that what she sees is a representation of suspicious and evasive behavior? She only\nknows what she sees based on her cultural experiences\u2014her cultural lens.\nNotice that in the latter half of the meeting, Melissa lowers her expectations and focuses her\nattention elsewhere. This is evident of her thinking, which implies that her cultural experiences are\nthe only ways to interpret the world. Rather than taking responsibility for how the meeting was run,\nshe puts the blame and responsibility on the family. To her, the father\u2019s constant interruptions and\nthe mother\u2019s silence represented disregard for her objectives; thus, her comment, \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\nhave a luxury in this job to meet parents whenever they want.\u201d\nWhat can be done to help Melissa improve her self-efficacy? Using the principles of CI, Melissa can\nthink about future cultural interactions in this way:\nAcquire: Melissa can identify what she knows and does not know about Middle Eastern culture and\nin particular, Iraqi culture and customs. By identifying these areas, she creates a chart of her\nknowledge. Culturally intelligent leaders need to know what gaps exist for them when they interact\nwith different cultures. In this case, Melissa will need to start at the basics, not just learning about\nIraqi culture; she needs to learn about her own culture in order to understand how Iraqi families may\nbe different from her own.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n104 Build: Melissa can build her knowledge of the culture by gathering information from different\nsources such as books, documentaries, attending local events, or speaking with someone who knows\nabout the culture. These are strategies she builds for herself to understand more about Iraqi culture.\nSome of these may be challenging to her because she may have never tried the strategies or activities\nbefore. But, as she conducts the activities, she can pay attention to how she feels and what she is\nthinking. By doing this, she will understand where her level of comfort is and where she needs to be\nchallenged.\nContemplate: When applying this component of CI, Melissa may create a goal for herself to listen\nmore to families\u2019 nonverbal cues. Paying attention to this enables her to suspend her assumptions.\nShe may even reflect on what assumptions come up for her before, during, and after meeting with\nfamilies. In contemplation, Melissa may reflect on her own motivation to helping families. How\ncommitted is she to helping all families, no matter their ethnic background? How motivated is she to\nkeep trying even when she feels uncomfortable? These are some questions that she can ask herself\nand then find solutions to, moving her forward in a positive manner.\nDo: Melissa\u2019s work in this particular CI element is to observe her own behaviors with families from\ndifferent cultural backgrounds. As she practices her strategies, she can monitor and evaluate whether\nthe behavior was appropriate or not by observing the responses from others. By checking her level of\nadaptability in the meetings, she will learn to mimic and mirror the appropriate cultural gestures and\ncues.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n105 5.3 Emotional Intelligence and Self-Efficacy\nHave you ever been to a busy mall, event, or festival, or shopping during the busiest time of the\nseason, and you could not find a parking spot? Driving all around, let us say that you finally located a\nspot, only to find that you cannot park there because there is a car that double-parked in that space.\nWhat is your reaction? What if this situation consistently happens to you and the parking lot is in a\ndifferent city or state, a different region of the country, or another country all together? What is your\nreaction then? What assumptions would you make about the people who drive the car? What\nassumptions might you have about the people who live in that city, state, region, or country?\nIn cultural intelligence, a development of high self-efficacy is necessary in unfamiliar cultural\nenvironments. You do not have a choice but to develop a higher self-efficacy. This area of the human\npotential is spoken about in the study of emotional intelligence. Daniel Goleman [1] was the first to\npopularize the concept of emotional intelligence (EI). Building on the work of John Mayer and Peter\nSalovey, Goleman distilled EI into a relatively concise set of five skills, addressed the following\nquestions:\n\uf0b7 How well do you know your emotions?\n\uf0b7 How well do you manage your emotions?\n\uf0b7 How do you adapt or change based on your emotions?\n\uf0b7 How well do you recognize the emotions in others?\n\uf0b7 How well do you handle relationships?\nSelf-management of emotions plays a critical role in leadership. As Goleman notes, managing\nemotions is a full-time job [2]. For leaders, self-management encompasses a multitude of\ncompetencies that include emotional self-control, that is, the ability to stay calm and clear-headed\nduring periods of high stress or during a crisis. It is important for leaders to develop ways of dealing\nwith their disruptive impulses and emotions, especially in intercultural situations.\nSelf-efficacy requires adaptability and initiative. Adaptability is your ability to juggle multiple\ndemands, adapt to new challenges, and adjust to new changes. Adaptability allows you to effectively\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n106 deal with the ambiguities of cultures. Your initiative is your competency to seize the challenges and\nturn them into opportunities. You create and act rather than wait.\nLearning to develop an optimistic perspective will help you to improve your self-efficacy, thus\nimproving your ability to be resilient to challenges. You begin to see the best in people and expect\nthat changes will be positive. For example, Viktor Frankl, a man who survived the horrific\nexperiences of the concentration camps in Nazi Germany, noted that even though he had suffered, he\nchose to see his experiences in the camps as one that held meaning for him. He said that choosing\nyour own attitude in any situation is one of the most powerful freedoms provided to mankind. [3]\nFrankl shows that choosing one\u2019s attitude can shift one\u2019s perspective, thus creating new possibilities.\nHis thinking on this subject matter has been instrumental in opening up new possibilities of thinking\nabout the capacity of human beings to survive and find meaning in life. His book Man\u2019s Search for\nMeaning provides a platform for existential therapy and logotherapy.\n[1] Goleman (1995).\n[2] Goleman (1995).\n[3] Frankl (1984).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n107 5.4 Mindfulness and Self-Efficacy\nWhat is mindfulness? According to Boyatzis and McKee, mindfulness \u201cis the capacity to be fully aware\nof all that one experiences inside the self\u2014body, mind, heart, spirit\u2014and to pay full attention to what\nis happening around us\u2014people, the natural world, our surroundings, and events.\u201d [1] Ajahn\nSumedho,[2] in Teachings of a Buddhist Monk, wrote that mindfulness is about a full awareness of\nwhat is going on inside; it not necessarily about concentrating on a particular object or thing,\nbecause our concentration does not last long. Rather, being mindful means allowing for the\nexperience of the moment to arise, whether that experience is confusion, hurt, laughter, or\nexcitement.\nMany people equate the concept of mindfulness to Eastern philosophers who look at mindfulness as\na process of self-awareness that directs the self to take part in being in the \u201cpresent moment.\u201d This\nreflective process is nonjudgmental, meaning that mindfulness is accepting whatever is happening.\nMindfulness is not thinking in terms of categorizing experiences or labeling them; rather, it allows\nthe experiences to just be. It does not associate with the ego\u2014\u201cI,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d and \u201cmine.\u201d Instead, it looks\nat only the experience(s) in the present moment from an objective stance or that of an observer. In\nthis way, mindfulness provides experiences so profound that it can, and has, changed perspectives\nand relationships.\nMindfulness has been shown to be effective in innovation and creativity. The phrase \u201cthink outside of\nthe box\u201d eludes to mindfulness. To \u201cthink outside of the box\u201d means that you cannot categorize,\nlabel, or see the issue or object in the same perspective as you did before. You must choose a different\nway to look at what is in front of you. This would mean that you need to challenge yourself to do\nthings outside of your comfort zone, and, oftentimes, you are doing something you would not even\nthink about doing. In this way, mindfulness is a process, not an outcome.\nCulturally intelligent leaders who use mindfulness are generally more open to possibilities and\ndifferent perspectives. They allow themselves to receive new information even if they believe that\nwhat is in front of them is indeed fact or true to them. A state of mindfulness helps to create\npossibilities and different avenues for growth. Take, for example, the following situation:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n108 Two politicians from opposing parties are in disagreement about actions to take regarding a potential new\nimmigration policy. Both politicians recognize that there is an immigration issue in the country and that it\nhas a significant impact on the economy. Both believe that controlling immigration into the country is the\nkey to maintaining national security and ensures the health and well-being of the country\u2019s citizens. One\nof the politicians believes that a way to control immigration is to round up all illegal immigrants and\ndeport them. The other politician believes that only specific illegal immigrants should return to their\ncountry. Enter a third politician who has been listening to the argument. This politician sees both sides of\nthe arguments and recognizes the truth in each statement. As a result of mindful listening, receiving, and\nreflection, this politician offers a third alternative that may contain components of the two opposing\narguments or it could be a completely different way of thinking about immigration.\nMindfulness techniques help you to come to an awareness of your self-efficacy. Through\nmindfulness, you learn to see your perspective of a situation, whether objects, people, places, or ideas\nare involved. The connection between mindfulness and self-efficacy is such that when you use\nmindfulness, it helps you to focus on your performance and goals.\nThis next exercise is to help you use mindfulness to accomplish a goal. On a piece of paper, write\ndown one goal you have (i.e., \u201cMy goal is to\u2026\u201d). This may be related to work, your family, your\nfinances, starting a new business, purchasing a new car\u2014anything you would like to obtain. Below\nyour stated goal, write down five things you plan on doing to achieve this goal. Next, have two people\n(e.g., friends, neighbors, strangers) each write down five things you can do to achieve this goal. Then,\nreview what you have written down to achieve your goal as well as what others have said for you to\ndo to reach your goal. Now, respond to the following questions:\n\uf0b7 How would you react if none of the plans you made turned out the way they were supposed to?\n\uf0b7 What if, in the middle of working toward your goal, the goal changed?\n\uf0b7 If you reached your goal exactly as you planned it, what would you have learned about yourself?\n\uf0b7 What type of life do you think you would lead if everything went according to your plans?\nAsking these questions not only helps you to be more mindful, it helps you to be more focused on\nyour goals.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n109 [1] Boyatzis & McKee (2005), p. 112.\n[2] Sumedho (2001).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n110 5.5 Mindlessness and Self-Efficacy\nWe make every effort to keep things as they are, because human beings, alone, lament transience. Yet no\nmatter how we grieve or protest, there is no way to impede the flow of anything. If we but see things as\nthey are and flow with them, we may find enjoyment in transience. Because human life is transient, all\nmanner of figures are woven into its fabric.\n- Shundo Aoyama, Zen Seeds\nEllen Langer [1] wrote that we are all capable of mindfulness, as well as its counterpart, mindlessness.\nWe subconsciously take part in mindlessness, out of habit or repetition, or out of our own self-placed\nlimitations; however, if we focused on mindfulness, we would, in fact, be able to change our\nperspective of ourselves, our situations, our environment, or our world. Mindlessness can lock us into\na specific way of being, thinking, and acting. We are not even aware that we are mindless unless we\nare in a situation where our mindlessness is challenged or we are conscious of being mindful.\nSimilar to this concept is the famous analogy of the cave by the Greek philosopher Plato. The analogy\ndescribes prisoners chained up in a cave, facing its wall; they have been there all their lives. They can\nonly see shadows of animals, people, or other objects that pass by the entrance of the cave. Because\nthey have never seen the outside of the cave, they do not know what is real except what they see in\nfront of them. In other words, they accept the shadows as reality. However, one person breaks free\nfrom the chains and is able to see that the realities of the shadows\u2014the objects, people, or animals\nbehind the shadows\u2014are real. He returns to tell the others about this new reality but is scorned and\nridiculed. No one believes that there is another reality besides what they see in front of them.\nMindlessness occurs because we are accustomed to categorizing things in a way that does not allow\nfor alternative possibilities. We automatically think in terms of limitations; therefore, we limit\nourselves in our thinking and behavior. For example, a short person who, for all of his life, feels that\nhis height limits and hinders him can never escape the category he has created for himself\u2014that is\nthat he is short. Even if others do not see the same reality as he does, his own reality is so strong that\nit affects his behavior and, ultimately, his sense of self-worth. It is the same with a woman who has\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n111 been repeatedly told that she is stupid and worthless. She begins to see that this is the only way to\nlive and starts to act out behaviors that mirror what she has been told.\nMindlessness can then lead to learned helplessness, a term that describes a state of futility after\nhaving experienced multiple failures. For example, if a mother constantly makes her daughter\u2019s bed\nin the morning, and the mother tells her daughter that the only person who can make the bed the\ncorrect way is a mother figure, then the daughter will learn that she cannot make her own bed or\neven that she is incapable of making a bed. What if the mother decides that she no longer wants to\nmake her daughter\u2019s bed? The daughter could make her own bed, but she may also reveal that she\ndoes not know how to make a bed and that the only person who could make a bed is a mother figure.\nLearned helplessness can also appear in cultural interactions. A number of times, I have met people\nwho believe that \u201cworking with other cultures is too difficult,\u201d and, as a result, their behaviors, their\nwords, and their attitudes speak to this. This mentality perpetuates their behaviors and their inability\nto escape this learned helplessness. They give up quickly, they make excuses, or they justify their\nbeliefs. By repeating movements, actions, behaviors, words, or thoughts, we enter a state of\nmindlessness. The tasks we have repeated become an unconscious part of us like driving, brushing\nour teeth, or eating.\nThe following exercises will assist you in thinking about how repetitive exercises can contribute to\nmindlessness and what the consequences of repetitive actions are:\n\uf0b7 Recite the alphabet; then, recite the alphabet backwards.\n\uf0b7 Sing the words to Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. Next, sing every other word to the song.\n\uf0b7 On a piece of paper, write down what you noticed when you recited the alphabet backwards and\nwhen you skipped every other word of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\n\uf0b7 Write a short note to a friend using your dominant hand. Now, using the nondominant hand,\nwrite the same short note to a friend. Write down what you noticed when you switched to your\nnondominant hand.\n[1] Langer (1989).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n112 5.6 Developing Your Self-Efficacy\nThis section outlines practical approaches you can use in your daily life to help increase your self-\nefficacy, your emotional intelligence, and your capacity to be mindful.\nIdentify Moments of Success\nYou should identify experiences when you have successfully worked with cultures other than your own.\nYou can also cultivate environments where you can be successful. Creating environments to practice and\nlearn from your mistakes is essential for culturally intelligent leaders. When you build a space for others\nto learn, you encourage their sense of self-efficacy. You help to minimize their doubts about working with\nothers, thus reducing their stress. However, focusing on creating easy successes can foster an\nenvironment where the individual comes to expect easy results. Find opportunities that both challenge\nand create success.\nTeach and Promote Resilience\nYou can create a strong sense of efficacy by purposefully teaching resiliency. As a leader, it is about\nteaching others how they can bounce back from failures. Everyone needs to learn that they have what it\ntakes to be successful in making it through difficulties. You can teach resiliency by promoting and\npointing out positive behaviors and attitudes. It is also about helping those you lead to identify when they\nare using negative self-talk. The following case illustrates a leader teaching and promoting resilience with\nher employee.\nTheresa, a senior sales manager, knows that a new hire, Jane, is new to working with a Hispanic\npopulation. What Jane knows about the population is based on media sources, research and papers she\u2019s\nread, and what she\u2019s picked up over time from her social network. Jane has a lot of work ahead of her if\nshe wants to understand and work well with this consumer base.\nTheresa provides constructive feedback to Jane in a variety of ways that encourages her to keep her\nmotivation and interest high. She compliments Jane on things she does well and often says, \u201cYou\u2019re\nmaking great progress.\u201d Although there are times when Jane just doesn\u2019t seem to \u201cget it\u201d as fast as she\nshould, Theresa believes that eventually with training and the proper resources, Jane will succeed.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n113 Recently, Jane came back to the office with a big smile on her face. She was able to negotiate and secure a\ncontract with a business in the Hispanic community. Theresa immediately congratulates her. \u201cThat\u2019s\nfantastic. Way to go! Tell me all about it.\u201d\nAs Jane recalls the experience, Theresa follows up with questions and prompts to convey her support and\nenthusiasm. When Jane recalls a minor setback in her conversation with the business, Theresa says, \u201cWait\nnow. Don\u2019t underestimate what you were able to do. That\u2019s a minor issue and I know that if you secured\nthe contract you must have adequately addressed that with the client.\u201d\nJane hesitates, and then nods her head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I did. He seemed real relaxed after I explained it to\nhim.\u201d\nTheresa notices the hesitation. To ensure that Jane realizes her good effort paid off, Theresa says, \u201cGood\nwork! Now that you\u2019ve had this experience, what lessons learned can you take to your next sales\nopportunity?\u201d\nTheresa provides teaching moments of resiliency to Jane. As a culturally intelligent leader should, she is\nhelping Jane learn the value of not giving up in the face of difficulty. She also points out the negative self-\ntalk (verbal and nonverbal) that Jane slips into the conversation. Theresa ends the conversation on a\npositive note, continuing to show interest and support of Jane\u2019s progress.\nAs Theresa is teaching Jane, she also learns about her own resiliency. Working with Jane is a new cultural\nexperience for her: She is working with someone who is unfamiliar with certain aspects of her job and the\nconsumers. As a person with many responsibilities, and one holding a position of leadership and authority\nin the organization, Theresa does not have a lot of time to manage Jane. Yet Theresa makes it a goal of\nhers to encourage and mentor Jane through the initial growing phase. Theresa\u2019s resilience, her\nperseverance, and her perception of her own abilities in relation to the situation help her keep her\nmotivation and interest high.\nProvide Social Role Models\nWhen you see someone who is successful and has accomplished the same goal as you, even in the face of\nresistance, you are more apt to believe that you, too, can accomplish those same goals. You believe that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n114 you have the abilities to master the tasks required to reach your goals. This is why finding a role model or\nmentor who is similar to you can help build your self-efficacy. If you are leading a team or department,\nyou can find social role models to encourage your employees to build their self-esteem.\nSelf-efficacy increases when you are able to relate to your role model or mentor. [1] If you surround\nyourself in cultural interactions with people who are not successful, even if you try very hard to be\nmotivated in these challenges, this will undermine your efforts. Finding someone who has overcome\ncultural challenges will greatly benefit you. For example, read the following story about Tom, David, and\nRaj:\nTom and David both lead sales departments for separate divisions of their manufacturing company. In the\npast two months, both have traveled frequently and separately to India to work with a new division of\ncustomer service representatives who work with their respective departments. Ever since their boss\ninformed them of this new venture, Tom and David have had separate emotions and experiences related\nto the new business situation.\nTom\u2019s been less enthusiastic and interested in the project. Having never been out of the country and\nworking only nationally, he\u2019s hesitant and less thrilled than David about the new division and what it\nwould entail. Similarly, David\u2019s never been out of the country, but he has, over time, cultivated interest in\ncultural experiences different from his own. He has intentionally taken part in different intercultural\nevents at local and national levels. He can\u2019t wait to get started on the project.\nRaj, their division supervisor, knows the abilities of each member of her staff. She requires them to\npurchase books and resources to help them learn about the local Indian culture. She\u2019s even enrolled them\nin a language and culture class. She knows that Tom has been more reluctant to try new things. David\nseems to be gaining momentum and retaining more information that he\u2019s learned compared to Tom. She\nnotices the difference and thinks that Tom could learn from David.\nBoth have worked together closely in the past and share similar career and personal goals. Raj capitalizes\non the relationship by building in a mentor-mentee component. She speaks to both of them about this\nnew piece to their working relationship and receives an agreement and support from both. She also\nmanages the relationship closely, ensuring that during this time Tom gets what he needs to be a culturally\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n115 intelligent leader and that David receives mentorship and guidance from her. In this way, they\u2019re working\nas partners, each serving as role models and mentors to another person.\nAs a leader, Raj is able to identify intercultural competency areas where Tom and David can both benefit.\nRaj knows that Tom needs support to boost his confidence level when working across cultures. She also\nknows that David has the self-confidence but needs assistance in understanding cultural facts. By building\nstrategies that are appropriate for each person, she builds her team\u2019s cultural intelligence. In the end, she\nlearns about her own ability to work with two managers who have different individual cultural\nexperiences.\nLead by Example\nIf you are able to manage and interact with different cultures more easily than your staff or employees are,\nmodel the way for them to understand how they could improve their own self-efficacies. Through your\nbehaviors, your beliefs, and your thinking, you demonstrate, by example, the skills and knowledge they\nneed to manage cultural environments. Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, [2] in The Leadership Challenge,\nfound that leaders should establish principles that guide people to reach their goals. Because a small shift\nor change could be overwhelming for some, helping them to set short, interim goals can help them to\nachieve larger goals. Modeling the way by identifying the barriers, being resourceful, and creating\nopportunities for your own success helps others to see their own abilities succeed. Take, for example, the\ncase of Jaime and Anne:\nJaime is in her late 20s. She serves as the director of a civic engagement program in a nonprofit\norganization. Anne is in her late 50s and manages the program, reporting directly to Jaime. They\u2019ve\nworked together for the past three years fairly well. They have their disagreements but overall have a\nhealthy working relationship.\nIn the last year, the board of directors has changed the nature of the program to incorporate civic\nengagement and service learning principles. As a result, an increasing amount of volunteers in the\nprogram are college and high school students. Jamie notices that Anne has difficulty working with a\nyounger generation of volunteers. She doesn\u2019t respond to them the way she responds to volunteers who\nare in her age group. Sometimes, Anne will make side comments about the younger generations\u2019 work\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n116 ethics saying, \u201cThey\u2019re so unreliable\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t just pick up the phone to talk to\nme. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t know how to leave a message on voicemail anymore.\u201d She\u2019s even said these\ncomments to her 55+ volunteers, who readily agree about the generational differences.\nJaime knows that Anne needs to be able to work with volunteers of all ages and cultural backgrounds.\nShe\u2019s seen the negative impacts of Anne\u2019s behavior. Many of the younger volunteers come to Jamie if they\nhave problems or issues when they should be going to Anne who directly manages them. They\u2019ve\nexpressed that Jaime is \u201cmore like them\u201d and understands them. Although Jamie doesn\u2019t mind helping\nthe volunteers with their questions, it\u2019s taking her away from her role and responsibilities as a leader of\nthe department. Additionally, it\u2019s setting a tone for how Anne works and reshaping her job duties.\nTo resolve this, Jaime speaks with Anne about the issue. Anne doesn\u2019t see a problem with how she\u2019s\nhandling the situation with younger volunteers. Jaime disagrees and at the end of the meeting, both agree\nto a plan that helps Anne to work more effectively with volunteers of any cultural background. Jamie and\nAnne work together to set goals that are achievable and work toward the long-term goals of the\norganization. Jaime finds opportunities to compliment Anne when she is successful and helps Anne to\nidentify strategies that help her do her work more efficiently.\nJaime continues to work with Anne in the months to come. She\u2019s patient and believes that Anne will be\nable to adapt; however, after two years, Jaime decides to let Anne go because the situation does not\nchange.\nIt is important to recognize that there are times that no matter how much you try to model the way for\nemployees and others, it does not work out to the benefit of the organization. In the example of Jamie and\nAnne, after 2 years of Jaime modeling the way and helping Anne, the progress was not significant enough\nto make the change that was needed. There was still resistance on Anne\u2019s part. After much reflection and\nevaluation, Jaime decided to let Anne go. The cost of low self-efficacy affects not only Anne but also the\nprogram and the organization\u2019s overall goals.\nSupport Others in Their Self-Efficacy Development\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n117 As any leader should, it is important to support your staff, co-workers, and the organization to strengthen\ntheir self-efficacy. You can do this in several ways:\n\uf0b7 Verbally tell them that they are making progress.\n\uf0b7 Have evaluation or reflection sessions about the progress.\n\uf0b7 Provide them with the right resources.\n\uf0b7 Tell them to keep trying and to sustain their efforts.\n\uf0b7 Know when to give feedback and what type of feedback to provide.\nIf you are looking to develop your own self-efficacy, then you need to put in systems that will help you. For\nexample, find the role models and proper support mechanisms to ensure you do not fail. Finding support\nis important because your support system helps to minimize your attention on weaknesses; they provide\nconstructive feedback to help you develop professionally.\nEmphasize Self-Improvement\nUnfamiliar cultural interactions are challenging, and you should look at your success and failures as\npersonal and professional development. There will be times when you will be involved in cultural\nmisunderstandings, make \u201ccultural bloopers,\u201d or take part in a cultural conflict. This is just a part of the\nprocess of navigating through cultural terrain. When this happens, you need to focus on the value of self-\nimprovement. Do not berate yourself over the mistake; learn to \u201clearn and let go.\u201d When it is an employee\nwho makes the mistake, do not compare them to others; rather, set a standard for improvement within\ncultural interactions and help the employee to get there. Notice how Jodi felt about herself in the\nfollowing case study:\nJodi is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technician. She\u2019s been in the field for ten years and works\nwith a variety of patients from different cultural backgrounds. One day, an African woman, Aziza, her son,\nGuleed, and her husband, Hussein, comes into the clinic for an MRI. The son accompanies his parents\nand interprets as needed because, although they understand English, they have difficulty speaking it.\nJodi calls the patient to the MRI room. Her co-worker, Melinda, assists her with the preparations and is\nwith her in the room. Jodi prepares for the MRI by giving Aziza instructions, \u201cYou will lie down on the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n118 machine. You need to be very still or we have to start over.\u201d Jodi then turns to Guleed and speaks slowly,\n\u201cCan you tell your mother that she needs to be very still when she\u2019s in there?\u201d\nGuleed understands and explains the MRI procedures to his mother. He then says to Jodi, \u201cMy mother\nhas done this before. She had an MRI three years ago. She knows what to do.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jodi says. Again, her next instructions to Guleed are spoken in a slow pace, \u201cDoes she need\nmedication to help her with staying still?\u201d\nGuleed shakes his head. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s done this before.\u201d\nJodi then turns to Aziza and says very slowly, \u201cIf you need help or to call us, you push this button.\u201d Her\ngestures to the family are overly emphasized when pointing to the call button. \u201cCan you tell her to push\nthis button if she needs help?\u201d Guleed, looking more frustrated as the instructions are dictated, nods his\nhead and explains to his mother.\nAfter the MRI, Jodi courteously thanks the family and says, \u201cYou all did a very good job. Have a good rest\nof your day.\u201d The family quickly walks out and Guleed gives a slight smile in response.\nJodi and Melinda return to their work, and Jodi says \u201cThat family was interesting. It was so nice of that\nboy to come with his parents to interpret, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nMelinda turns to Jodi and replies, \u201cYes, it was a good thing that he was there.\u201d She hesitates and then\nsays, \u201cBut you know, you probably didn\u2019t need to talk like that to them.\u201d\nWith surprise, Jodi says, \u201cTalk like what?\u201d\n\u201cYou were talking really slowly to them. It seemed like they didn\u2019t appreciate it. The son knew English\nvery well and was fine interpreting and understanding what you told him.\u201d\nJodie replies, \u201cOh. But in that class we took the trainer said we should talk slow and not use big words so\nthey can understand us. That\u2019s what I was doing. I mean, she probably didn\u2019t know what I was talking\nabout so I had to talk slow to help her understand.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n119 \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true but you were really dramatic about it. They\u2019re not deaf. They just have a harder time\ngrasping the language.\u201d\nJodi pauses and then says, \u201cYou\u2019re right. How embarrassing! I hope they don\u2019t think badly of me. I was\njust trying to get them to understand what they needed to do. Next time I\u2019ll do it differently.\u201d\nJodi tries to apply what she has learned in cultural competency training, yet she is not able to apply the\nlearning in a way that is appropriate to different racial and ethnic groups. This is evident when her\ncolleague, Melinda, informs her that she thought Jodi used the wrong cultural competency tools. Jodi\u2019s\ninstant emotional response was to be offended and to feel guilty for her intercultural mistakes. However,\nshe realizes that her experience and mistake will only improve her ability to work better with different\ncultures.\nJodi can use the CI principles to help her in the following way:\nAcquire: In this case study, Jodi has good intentions to be respectful of another culture. But what she is\nnot picking up on are the verbal and nonverbal cues of her environment. If Jodi can identify what she did\nwell and where she could improve, she can better assess her level of understanding culture in this\nsituation. Jodi has worked with families of different backgrounds, but it seems as if no one has told her\nthat she was unintentionally creating an uncomfortable environment for those families. To acquire\ninformation about culture that can be helpful to her in future situations she can start with recognizing\nwhat cultural facts and knowledge she may already have. For example, she speaks slower to this family so\nthey can understand. Yet she needs to know that not all families need to be spoken to in this manner.\nBuild: If Jodi can take the knowledge she has, speaking slower in English can help those who are not\nEnglish native speakers, and combine this with the knowledge that not all non-English speakers need to\nbe spoken to in this way, then she will begin to build her awareness for when speaking slowly would be\nappropriate. When she does this, she is creating new information and making new sense of the cultural\ninformation.\nContemplate: Even though Jodi is familiar working with families of different cultures, she can always\napproach the situations with new lenses or perspectives. By asking herself what she sees and does not see\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n120 in the situation, she can shift her mindset from one that treats all families the same to one that treats\nthem as unique. Contemplation requires Jodi to reflect on her biases as well as the unintentional\nconsequences that come about because of her need to be culturally appropriate.\nDo: As she practices the strategies she creates for each family situation, she will learn what works and\ndoes not work for each family. She may even be surprised that she is adapting and changing her behaviors\nwith every family she treats, even if the families share similar cultural backgrounds and interests. The\nmore she practices and evaluates, the more she will reduce her need to be perfect in every cultural\nsituation. Instead, she will learn that her mistakes become cultural lessons in practice.\nReduce Anxiety and Stress Related to Cultural Interactions\nWhen we feel we are capable of accomplishing a goal, we have positive emotions. When we know that we\ndo not have the abilities to accomplish the goal, our emotions and mood for the activity are less positive.\nHow we feel can be a deterrent to our success by affecting our attitudes and perceptions of who we are and\nhow we will achieve our goals. Our negative moods can create stress, anxiety, frustration, and fear\u2014all\nwhich do not serve you in intercultural work. As a leader, you should help support strategies that reduce\nthe stress and anxiety related to unfamiliar cultural situations. And, if you are the one who gets anxious,\nstressed out, or disinterested, you should find strategies that work for you. The following are some tips for\nreducing stress and anxiety related to unfamiliar cultural settings that can bring about a more positive\noutlook:\n\uf0b7 Keep a stress journal. Use the journal as a way to track your physical and emotional responses to\nunfamiliar cultural settings. As you write out your feelings, you will begin to see common themes\nand patterns in your behavior. When you can identify what makes you stressed and how you\ntypically respond, you can find the appropriate strategies to reduce your stress level.\n\uf0b7 Keep a gratitude journal. When we are stressed and our anxiety is high, we often cannot see the\nopportunities and positive outcomes in intercultural relationships. Keeping a gratitude journal\nenables us to identify the pieces of the relationship or the situation that contributes positively\nback to our self-development, even though, at the time, we may think it is the worst thing to have\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n121 happened. Writing down a few things you are grateful for in the situation helps to shift your\nmind-set and calm your physical and emotional state.\n\uf0b7 Break your goal into smaller, manageable steps. For example, if you need to learn a new\nlanguage and culture but it seems overwhelming, break that goal into smaller tasks over time. Do\nnot take on more than you can handle. If the time does not allow for it, ask your supervisor for\nsupport and ideas to make it more manageable.\n\uf0b7 Express your feelings and emotions in a healthy manner. For example, you need to be able to\ncommunicate your feelings and thoughts to your supervisor. Your concerns should be expressed\nin a respectful manner. If you do not share your concerns with your supervisor, you will build\nresentment and emotional clutter around the situation. If this continues over time, you build\nunhealthy habitual patterns and responses every time you are in unfamiliar territory.\n\uf0b7 Be willing to compromise and let go. Working with cultures means that you have to be adaptable\nand willing to let go of what you know. You have to be flexible or else you are always going to have\nproblems that frustrate, disappoint, and anger you.\n\uf0b7 Stay calm and focused on the task. The more anxious you are, the more you visualize and paint a\npicture that creates more stress for you. According to Bandura, [3] your stress level can impair how\nyou function inter- and intrapersonally. Staying calm and focused helps you decrease your stress\nand anxiety.\n\uf0b7 Recognize that you cannot control culture. Culturally intelligent leaders know that culture cannot\nbe controlled. It is ever changing, never static. You have to recognize that there are times in\ncultural situations that you cannot anticipate, no matter how much you have trained, read\nresources, or lived in the culture. As in life, there are many things that are out of our control. We\ncannot expect that our intentions will always have the impact we envision it to be. This is why\nfocusing on the things we can control, such as our adaptive responses to another person or\nculture, is better than stressing about what we cannot control.\n\uf0b7 Be willing to forgive. People make mistakes. At times, people are not aware of what they have\nsaid or the implications of what they have done. When it comes to cultural intelligence, you have\nto be willing to forgive others both for what they are conscious and not conscious of doing, saying,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n122 or feeling. If you cannot forgive, you are going to have a hard time working with unfamiliar\ncultural environments.\n\uf0b7 Keep your sense of humor. Working interculturally can be both tiring and exhilarating. There will\nbe times when you make mistakes and feel disappointed for not picking up the cues or for not\n\u201cknowing what to do.\u201d Keeping a sense of humor about culture lessens the stress. You have to be\nable to laugh at yourself; otherwise, the challenges of cultural differences become too much to\nbear.\nI once consulted with an organization that had a tool called \u201cThe Wizard.\u201d This tool helped organizations\nto be more accountable and transparent in their use of charitable donations. They wanted to expand their\ntool to a diverse audience. In a session focused on thinking about how the tool could be more accessible, it\nstruck us that, in one of the languages, the word \u201cwizard\u201d translated into \u201cShaman.\u201d In this community,\nthe shaman happens to be someone who is wise and connects with the spirit world. Can you imagine\ngoing into the community and talking about how \u201cthe shaman\u201d will help you to be more accountable? We\nall laughed, and we also used this as an opportunity to discuss the challenges of accessibility.\n[1] Bandura (1994).\n[2] Kouzes & Posner (2002).\n[3] Bandura (1994).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n123 5.7 Chapter Summary\n\uf0b7 Interactions within cultures are based on a person\u2019s sense of efficacy, which is their belief about\ntheir abilities to perform what is required in new cultural settings.\n\uf0b7 Culturally intelligent leaders have higher levels of self-efficacy. They look at challenges as\nopportunities, they are resilient and persistent in their pursuance of the goal, they have higher\nconfidence levels, and they are committed to finding solutions.\n\uf0b7 Individuals who have low self-efficacy have lower expectations of themselves in new cultural\nsettings, they lose interest and commitment under duress, and they focus on doubts and negative\noutcomes.\n\uf0b7 Emotional intelligence speaks to the importance of self-efficacy in leadership; it points out the\ncritical role self-efficacy has on managing one\u2019s emotions, adaptability, and optimism.\n\uf0b7 Mindfulness brings about creativity and innovation. It takes leaders \u201cout of their boxes\u201d and gives\nthem a new way of perceiving themselves, their abilities, and their world.\n\uf0b7 Mindlessness comes about through repetitive behaviors. Mostly unconsciously, a state of\nmindlessness can lead to learned helplessness.\n\uf0b7 Research has shown that you can improve your self-efficacy, and the chapter highlights areas for\nleadership development.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n124 Chapter 6\nAdapting and Performing\nEarly in my professional career, I was a part of a marketing and sales team that included two team\nmembers who had very different working styles and personalities. Louisa was quiet, spent a lot of\ntime reflecting, and responded only when asked questions or prompted to speak. When she arrived\nat work, she went straight to her desk, shut the door, and got right to her tasks. She was seen as\n\u201clevel-headed,\u201d practical, and a no-nonsense type of person. When you had to ask her a question, you\ncould find Louisa in her office, steadily working on her tasks and projects. When she spoke, she was\ndirect and concise. Sometimes, when making a point or supporting argument, she numbered her\npoints out loud, such as, \u201cFirst, I think we need to do this. Second, we will move on to this. Third, if\nthe previous situation does not work, then we can go to option two.\u201d Our team thought she was\nfriendly, although a bit distant and not very personable in her interactions.\nJoseph was the opposite. He had was very gregarious in nature. He talked all the time, whether\nsomeone wanted to hear his ideas or not; most of the time, it was just entertaining to hear him speak\nand share his stories. Upon his arrival every morning, he went around to all the offices (this was a\nsmall organization) and chatted with whoever had arrived. It took him awhile to get settled into his\noffice and to begin his work. When you needed Joseph to review a document or ask him a question,\nhe could be found talking with people outside of his office. When he spoke, it was hard to follow his\nthoughts because he jumped from story to story, sometimes confusing himself in the process. And\nthere were times that he would say things out loud, not to get our feedback but just to process the\ninformation. We thought he just liked hearing himself talk, and our team culture was such that we\nfound him to be very personable and likeable, quirks and all.\nAs a young professional who was looking to make her mark on the working world, I found my time\nwith Louisa to be extremely challenging. How was I to make an impression when this manager did\nnot even want to talk to me? How was she to be aware of my talents and skill sets? I quickly learned\nthat I related more easily to Joseph. He always asked me how I was, what projects I was working on,\nand whether I was enjoying my time with the organization. These conversations with Joseph were\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n125 not short; rather, they often lasted as long as 30 minutes. Through these conversations, I learned a\nlot about the workings of the organization, where my skills could be most helpful, and where I could\nadvance in the company.\nEvery time I interacted with Louisa, I took a cautious and pragmatic approach. I knew my\nconversations with her would be short and to the point. In the beginning, I went into her office,\nengaging her in dialogue about things outside of work and failed miserably. But after a few\nconversations, I picked up some verbal and nonverbal cues about her \u201cconversation motto,\u201d which\nwas \u201cMake it short and to the point.\u201d I began to mimic her actions and language. When speaking\nabout several points, I numbered them out loud the way she did. I found that I was more formal than\nusual with her than with others. I looked directly in her eyes, and once even caught myself looking at\nmy watch when I thought she was talking too long!\nWith Joseph, talking to him could take a while. I talked to him only when I knew I had no other\nappointments or deadlines to meet. I entered his office with a singsong-like \u201chello,\u201d which was the\nway he greeted others. We never talked business right away. And I noticed that, when explaining a\nstory or a point, my hand gestures always matched his. Even the tone of my voice mimicked his.\nWhen I interacted with Louisa and Joseph, my behavior changed from person to person. I cannot tell\nyou exactly when in our working relationship this began; I assume it happened partly on a conscious\nlevel and partly on an unconscious level. What is important to note about this personal story is that\nchanging my behaviors enabled me to work better with both Louisa and Joseph.\nEarley and Peterson stated, \u201cAdopting the behaviors consistent with a target culture is an important\naspect of intercultural adjustment and interaction.\u201d [1]Similarly, Thomas and Inkson said,\nWhether or not social behavior takes place in a cross cultural setting, each situation will be\nunique and in particular will involve interaction with other unique people\u2026you must be able to\nadapt your general approach and specific interactions to the particular characteristics of the\nsituation, and particularly, to the expectations of the other people involved. [2]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n126 Thus, cultural intelligence requires that you engage in adaptive behavior and necessitates that you\nhave the understanding and motivation to achieve it. This third element of cultural intelligence refers\nto the ability of individuals to go beyond thinking: they must be doing something. To be a culturally\nintelligent leader, it is not enough for you to know the information you need and how you will think\nabout it, nor is it enough to be motivated. You must have the appropriate behavioral responses and\nbe able to acquire or adapt the behaviors to new cultural situations. And you must be willing to try\nand learn new behaviors, and to know when and how to use them.\nLearning new behaviors is considered the most challenging component of cultural intelligence. This\nis because behaviors are rooted in our beliefs and values. Rather than being skilled in particular sets\nof behaviors, as a culturally intelligent leader, it is better to have a repertoire of behaviors that you\nknow of and use. You must be good at behaving in a manner that will not confuse other individuals.\nYou cannot expect that your behavior will remain the same with all individuals from either the same\nor different cultural groups. You need to have a variety of behavioral skills you can draw from.\nThis chapter discusses four key ideas in relationship to adaptive behavior: the concept of self,\ncognitive dissonance, linguistic relativity, and behavior and communication.\n[1] Earley & Peterson (2004), p. 109.\n[2] Thomas & Inkson (2003), p. 58.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n127 6.1 Concept of Self\nGeorge Herbert Mead [1] argued that individuals develop a self-concept that evolves throughout their\nlives as a result of interacting with their social world, which may include parents, teachers, and peers.\nSimilarly, William Purkey stated that \u201cself-concept may be defined as the totality of a complex,\norganized, and dynamic system of learned beliefs, attitudes and opinions that each person holds to\nbe true about his or her personal existence.\u201d [2] These interactions help individuals form a perception\nof who they are based on expectations from, and responses to, their social environment. Our\nperceptions are stimulated by internal and external factors. These factors can create intense\nemotional responses, which impact our willingness to learn and our choice of action\u2014they guide\nindividual behaviors. The following example demonstrates this idea of self-concept and how it\nmanifests in one\u2019s behaviors.\nLike many teenagers in the United States, Karen was required to take a foreign language course at her\nschool. She chose to learn German because relatives on her mother\u2019s side lived in Germany, and her\nfamily was planning a visit in the summer. Unfortunately, Karen\u2019s few months of German class were not\nfun. She had a teacher who was very strict in her lesson plans and grading of the students. Additionally,\nKaren fell behind in the class work due to an after school sports injury; she was out for two weeks. When\nshe returned to class, her teacher called her out in front of other students when she didn\u2019t know the\ncorrect vocabulary terms and proper responses. She didn\u2019t feel motivated to be in class and learn German.\nWhen summer arrived, her family went to Germany as planned to visit their relatives. Karen\u2019s parents had\nbeen excited about her foreign language choice, and her relatives knew she was taking a German culture\nand language course. During the stay with the relatives, Karen tried to practice her German but stopped\ntrying after her relatives told her, \u201cYou need to improve your German.\u201d The next year, her family visited\nGermany again, and her relatives question her about her German language skills. Upon hearing her speak,\nthey told her again, \u201cYou\u2019re not there yet. You need a lot of improvements.\u201d\nTwenty years later, Karen works for a financial company that has a location in Germany. Karen\u2019s\nsupervisor tells her that she will need to relocate to Germany for two years; she thinks that with Karen\u2019s\ngreat interpersonal skills, she would be able to help the success of the project. Upon hearing this, Karen\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n128 becomes anxious and uncomfortable. She makes excuses for not going, and her supervisor is confused.\nKaren has been an outstanding worker and her actions are puzzling and surprising.\nKaren\u2019s self-concept has contributed to her self-efficacy. The expectations of her teacher, her family,\nand her relatives to learn a new language is too much for her to handle. The responses she receives\nare not what she wants or needs to hear to help her improve her German language skills. As a result,\nshe withdraws from learning the language and culture. She develops a self-concept that may consist\nof any of the following:\n\uf0b7 I will never learn the German language and the culture.\n\uf0b7 I do not have the ability or skills to learn a new language.\n\uf0b7 It is easier if I just do what is comfortable for me.\n\uf0b7 I cannot make mistakes or people will lose their confidence in me.\nThese beliefs and attitudes surface when her supervisor asks her to relocate to Germany. The\nnegative memories and experiences she had become barriers to her success and self-efficacy. She\nfeels anxious, and her behaviors are seen as strange.\nDeveloping a Self-Concept\nThere are three general understandings about how a self-concept is developed. First, a self-concept is\nlearned. As Mead indicates, a self-concept gradually emerges early in one\u2019s life and is constantly shaped\nthroughout life by one\u2019s perceived experiences. This means that a self-concept is learned: it is a social\nproduct of one\u2019s experiences. The perception of one\u2019s self-concept may differ from how others perceive\nthat person, and it is different during every life stage. When a person is presented with an experience that\ndiffers from the self-concept he or she has developed, the person sees the experience as a threat. The more\nexperiences that challenge the self-concept, the more rigid the self-concept becomes. Generally, an\nindividual will try to overthink, overgeneralize, or rationalize the experience so as to reduce the emotional\nhavoc it creates.\nSecond, a self-concept is organized. Most scholars agree that individuals develop a self-concept that\nhas stable characteristics in order to maintain harmony. Our self-concept is orderly: it categorizes our\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n129 experiences and \u201cfits\u201d them in a way that will make sense to our development. It discards experiences that\npresent different beliefs and values because it cannot be placed in a categorical way. It is our self-concept\nthat tries to resist change, because the changes disrupt the stability of one\u2019s personality. Let us say you\nhold a very specific belief, such as, \u201cEnglish is the primary language of this country and everyone should\nlearn to speak and write it. There is no reason to have billboards and signs in other languages.\u201d The more\ncentral this belief is to your self-concept, the more resistant you are to learning new experiences and to\nadapting your belief.\nThird, a self-concept is dynamic. Self-concepts are actively shaped based on one\u2019s experiences, which\nmeans that they are dynamic. The self-concept can be seen as a guidance system directing your behaviors\nto match up with your beliefs. I often hear employees in organizations say, \u201cMy company does not do what\nit says it will do around diversity and inclusion. It says one thing, and its actions are completely the\nopposite.\u201d At an organizational level, the company may perceive itself differently, defending its self-\nconcept. There is a conflict between this perception of who they are versus what others think they really\nare. Complaints from employees will be rationalized, or bended, to fit the self-concept of the organization\nand its leaders. In psychology, this is called cognitive dissonance, that is, one\u2019s justification for one\u2019s\nbeliefs even when the facts clearly demonstrate the opposite.\nThe following case study illustrates the self-concept in action.\nJoe leads a Public Safety department in Garden Grove, a suburb located just outside of a large urban city\nin the Midwest. He\u2019s lived and worked in this city all his life, and generations of his family have made\nGarden Grove their home. They settled in the area when it was just farmland and have seen it develop\nover time into a bustling city of 128,000.\nGarden Grove, like other suburban cities in the United States, has seen an increase in the number of non-\nwhite residents. A large number of Asian residents move into the city because they are attracted to the\neducational system and quality of life the city offers. This change has made the city more racially diverse\nthan ever.\nJoe sees the visible differences on a personal and professional level. In his neighborhood, 25% of his\nneighbors are Asian Indian, 10% are Vietnamese, and 10% are Chinese. He\u2019s had problems with his\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n130 neighbors; what used to be a quiet neighborhood is now a festival every week. His neighbors have lots of\nvisitors who park up and down the side street, their children running around without any parental\nguidance. Once, he held a party to celebrate his son\u2019s graduation from high school, and his relatives and\nfriends had to park two blocks away because of his neighbor\u2019s party.\nAt work, he\u2019s pressured from his director to hire more people who \u201creflect the community\u201d that Garden\nGrove has become. From volunteers to paid staff, he\u2019s had to work through policy changes and make\naccommodations for who he hires. He disagrees with his director that he should hire someone just to\nmake a quota, and besides, he can\u2019t find anyone who has the skills or the experience for the department\njobs. Although he loves his job, it\u2019s not what it used to be. He\u2019s increasingly unmotivated to go to work. It\nseems that all he does these days is attend training sessions on diversity. What\u2019s happened to his passion\nfor public service?\nAs the director, you have noticed the changes in Joe. You know it has to do with the new vision of the\norganization to increase racial and cultural diversity as part of the city\u2019s strategic vision. To help Joe\nmanage his self-concept, think about the following questions: What do you think is Joe\u2019s self-concept?\nWhat are the beliefs that are being challenged? When evaluating this case study, there are several items\nthat are important to note:\n\uf0b7 Joe has a long history of family traditions and roots in Garden Grove.\n\uf0b7 His experiences and knowledge of Garden Grove span generations.\n\uf0b7 Joe and his family are accustomed to interacting with people who are Caucasian.\n\uf0b7 He has a belief that his neighborhood was a \u201cquiet\u201d place to live, but it is now disrupted because\nof the new neighbors, who are not so quiet.\n\uf0b7 He has a belief that the parties thrown by his neighbors are so large that he considers them\nfestivals.\n\uf0b7 He does not understand the collective nature of the Asian Indians, Vietnamese, and Chinese\nneighbors in his neighborhood.\n\uf0b7 He believes that one should be hired on the basis of merit and skill rather than filling a quota.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n131 All of these items are some examples of Joe\u2019s beliefs that form his self-concept. In the case study, you can\nalso identify what emotions and feelings he has related to his self-concept, such as his discomfort with\nnonwhites. Identifying emotions is useful for understanding how the self-concept develops to make the\nperson feel comfortable.\nDeveloping a Self-Understanding\nOne\u2019s self-concept is developed throughout one\u2019s lifetime and has an impact on behaviors and choice of\naction. How have you come to understand yourself over time? How has this understanding led to the\nchoices you make? One way of gaining knowledge of who you are is through personality assessments.\nThere is a plethora of assessments and inventories, and I describe three that I have used successfully with\ndiverse audiences. I have found that these three assessments are excellent tools for building cultural\nintelligence and leadership.\n\uf0b7 Reflected \u201cBest Self\u201d Exercise helps individuals to identify their strengths and talents. The\nexercise requires that you seek out and request feedback from significant people in your life\u2014\nsiblings, parents, friends co-workers, colleagues, mentors, supervisors, relatives, and so on. Once\nyou collect the information, you create a picture of your \u201cbest self.\u201d [3]\n\uf0b7 Via Institute on Character is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2000 by Dr. Martin E.\nP. Seligman and Dr. Neal H. Mayerson. The organization provides, free of charge, a survey (VIA\nSurvey of Character) that measures 24 character strengths. VIA stands for \u201cValues in Action,\u201d and\nthe survey can be used to help improve one\u2019s performance and well-being. [4]\n\uf0b7 The Enneagram Institute provides a personality assessment to help you discover and understand\nyour personality type. The institute suggests that there are nine basic personality types, and these\ntypes serve as a framework for understanding oneself and working with others.

Dissonance makes people feel uncomfortable and \u201cis bothersome under\nany circumstance, but it is most painful to people when an important element of their self-concept is\nthreatened\u2014typically when they do something that is inconsistent with their view of\nthemselves.\u201d [2] A famous case in cognitive dissonance comes from the work of Leon Festinger, who\ndescribed the workings of cognitive dissonance that occurred in a group setting.\nFestinger and his associates studied a group that believed that the earth was going to be destroyed by\na flood on a certain date. This belief led group members to gather in the same location and pray; by\ndoing so, they believed they would be saved. In the end, there was no flood and no end of the world.\nSo what happened to the members? For the group members who were really committed to the belief\n(basically, giving up their homes and jobs), when the flood did not happen, these individuals had a\nlarge dissonance between their beliefs and the evidence they saw. Because of this large gap between\ntheir beliefs and the evidence at hand, they were more likely to reinterpret the evidence to show that\nthey were right all along. For example, they would say that the earth was not destroyed because they\ncame together to pray. While these individuals justified their beliefs, the others recognized the\nfoolishness of the experience and changed their beliefs or actions.\nUsing this example to guide our thinking about cultural intelligence, we can see that culturally\nintelligent leaders must be able to address the dissonance between their beliefs, ideas, or their\nattitudes and behaviors. When leaders fail to see the connection, they are not really walking the\ncultural intelligence they talk. Some leaders will justify their beliefs even when the evidence\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n134 eventually contradicts their belief systems. And rarely do we see organizational leaders change their\nbeliefs or actions to align with what they say they will do around diversity and culture.\nLearning and Dissonance\nDissonance can also occur when new learning or ideas are presented that conflict with what is already\nknown. For example, an employee is required to attend a diversity workshop. During the session, the\nemployee hears ideas that contradict, or come in conflict with, her belief about the topic. This employee\nalready has certain knowledge about cultural diversity that she brings to the workshop, and because she is\nespecially committed to her own knowledge and belief system, it is more likely that the employee will\nresist the new learning.\nYou can tell when a person is struggling with dissonance when you hear statements like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t\npeople who come to this country be more like us,\u201d or \u201cWhy do we have to take these classes,\u201d or \u201cI have to\nchange my belief (or what I do) just to accommodate someone else?\u201d More often than not, when the new\nlearning is difficult, uncomfortable, or even humiliating, people are more likely to say that the learning or\nworkshop was useless, pointless, or valueless. To admit one\u2019s dissonance would symbolize that one has\nbeen \u201chad\u201d or \u201cconned\u201d into believing something different.\nIf all this sounds familiar to you, or resonates with what is going in your organization, you are not alone.\nOur behaviors are very much rooted in beliefs that are not completely explored within a working\nenvironment. Organizational leaders do not clearly articulate how to think about and practice cultural\nintelligence. The result is a failure to implement and practice cultural intelligence that corresponds with\nthe belief systems. Organizational leaders\u2014especially those specifically working on diversity initiatives\u2014\nneed to identify the points of dissonance that occur in their organization and among their staff. Leaders\nshould pay attention to this dissonance and how it is being expressed.\nLarger Gaps, Larger Dissonance\nAccording to cognitive dissonance theory, the more important the issue and the larger the gap between\nthe beliefs, the greater the dissonance among people. This is critical for leaders to understand because\nculture is a very important issue within an organization. There are inherently large gaps in beliefs on a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n135 personal, team, and organizational level related to this culture. Individual beliefs about power and\nprivilege\u2014as they relate to gender inequity, race inequity, generational differences, ability and disability,\nsexual orientation, religion, and so on\u2014need to be explored in organizations and among leaders. If\ndissonance is not discussed, leaders will continue to employ workers who (a) feel uncomfortable talking\nabout culture and diversity, (b) continue to behave in inappropriate ways, (c) are accepting of culture on\nthe outside but do not align diversity with their beliefs, and (d) feel that all they need are the \u201cright tools\u201d\nor the \u201cright answers\u201d to be culturally competent.\nWithout careful attention to exploring the stories of dissonance, leaders allow their organizations to bury\ntheir inclusion blind spots. Blind spots in cognitive dissonance describe the things you cannot see because\nthey are hidden or because you choose not to see them. We are unaware of our blind spots because our\nfocus is directed toward other things or we are distracted from what needs to be done. Blind spots can\nlead to underestimating or overestimating our cultural abilities and to truly understanding what needs to\nbe done regarding culture and diversity. Regardless of the talent that is recruited, the accomplishments or\nprogress that is made, or even how much money is poured into diversity initiatives, these blind spots can\ncause leaders to miss opportunities that bring about positive, transformative change and innovation.\nGiven this information, what can leaders do about the cultural dissonance within their organizations?\nFirst, leaders must have the courage to be open to the possibilities that their beliefs, or the organization\u2019s\nbeliefs, are not aligned with their actions and behaviors. It takes courageous leadership to not maintain\nthe status quo and to explore the stories that give root to organizational and individual beliefs. Second,\nleaders can, and should, explore the dissonance by asking themselves the following questions:\n\uf0b7 What are my organization\u2019s beliefs about culture?\n\uf0b7 What dissonance is present in our beliefs and our behaviors?\n\uf0b7 What gaps (in recruitment, within policy, and in intrapersonal interactions) are created because\nof the dissonance?\n\uf0b7 How is this dissonance stopping us from truly understanding culture?\nIn cultural intelligence work, it is critical that you recognize your self-concept to understand your blind\nspots. As a leader, it is your responsibility to help others recognize their self-concept and the role it plays\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n136 in intercultural interactions. It is essential for you to understand that people will often choose to stick to\ntheir beliefs (even if it no longer serves them) to alleviate the emotional stress that reorganizing a self-\nconcept requires. They would rather fend off the perceived threat than create learning opportunities out of\nthese experiences.\nFinally, it is important for leaders to work with employees to explore employee dissonance. Learning to\nwork with, and understand, cultures is not the sole responsibility of leaders; it is the responsibility of\neveryone within an organization. Because leaders are in the positional power to promote and support the\nwork, it is the responsibility of the leaders to help their employees uncover their blind spots. With clear\nsight of these blinds spots, organizations can turn them into an advantage. By doing so, organizations can\nfind significantly greater possibilities that expand and deepen intercultural work than previously\nimagined.\nAdapting and Modifying Behaviors\nWhen we learn something new, we change our perspectives of our world, the way we interact with others,\nand our behaviors. We also learn when our behaviors are inappropriate and, hopefully, learn not to repeat\nthem. We do this by adjusting our behaviors so that the situation does not occur again. We act differently\nbased on previous consequences. If our behaviors resulted in a positive impact, we would continue the\nbehavior. Take, for example, the following story about New Zealand\u2019s soccer team, \u201cAll Whites.\u201d\nAfter landing from a long flight from Austria, New Zealand\u2019s soccer team, All Whites, heads to the South\nAfrican stadium for their first day of training. They are met by a \u201csmelly fog\u201d on the field, making it\ndifficult for players and coaches to breathe and see. One player comments on the smell and smog saying,\n\u201cYou could tell [it was smoky] as we came in on the bus. You could taste it, breathe it on the bus. It\u2019s\nsomething that\u2019s a bit different for us and something else to adapt to on tour.\u201d The management team\ndebates canceling the training and in the end decides to have players stretch their legs and get some\nexercise. Local South Africans on staff are confused at the entire ruckus and can\u2019t understand why a team\nwould stop playing because of a \u201clittle smog.\u201d The players and team management can\u2019t understand how\nanyone could play under such conditions. [3]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n137 Learning a new pattern of behavior requires modifying small behaviors that add up to a complex behavior.\nLearning new patterns can be difficult but the motivation to modify and change can be transformational.\nKevin Cashman said that positive change means letting go of our old behaviors and allowing change to be\nour teacher. [4] As leaders, we must recognize our own capacity to change\u2014that we have what it takes to\nmake a change. To make a change, you need to believe you are capable of performing the behavioral\nchange and that there is an incentive to change. Similarly, Margaret Wheatley said this about the human\ncapacity to change and transform,\nViability and resiliency of a self-organizing system comes from its great capacity to adapt as\nneeded, to create structures that fit the moment. Neither form nor function alone dictates how the\nsystem is organized\u2026The system may maintain itself in its present form or evolve into a new\norder, depending on what is required. It is not locked into any one structure; it is capable of\norganizing into whatever form it determines best suits the present situation. [5]\nWhen making changes to your behaviors, there are three questions to ask to help initiate the change. [6]\nWhat is changing? To understand change, you must be clear about what you want to change in your\ncultural interactions. Then, make it your intention to change and carry out the change. Finally, your\nchange must be linked to your motivation for changing. You will need to ask, why is it important that I\nmake this change? How will this change my future interactions with this individual or cultural group?\nWhat will actually be different because of the change? Because transformative change in cultural\ninteractions can be hard, the ability to visualize the end result or outcome of the change can help move the\nsituation forward. Visualization requires an articulation for what the desired result and outcomes look\nlike. Setting clear expectations for getting to the desire result can help motivate you to making the change.\nWho\u2019s going to lose what? In any cultural shift you will need to ask yourself, What beliefs and values\nmight I have to let go? Why is it hard to abandon your beliefs and values? How well have these values and\nbeliefs served you? What are the barriers they create for your future? Consider the following case study of\ntwo individuals\u2019 behaviors in relation to one other:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n138 Jose is from Costa Rica and Mary is from Great Britain. They work together in an international company\nlocated in the United States. Mary notices that whenever Jose talks, he always inches closer to her\npersonal space. She\u2019s extremely uncomfortable when this happens and always takes steps back to give\nmore physical space to the conversation. When she does this, Jose comes closer. One time, Mary was\nbacked up to a work place counter and Jose didn\u2019t even notice!\nImagine that Mary and Jose work for you, and Mary has approached you with her concerns. To help Mary\nfind a solution to this situation, use the following table to help you to think through some important\nquestions; then, look at the second column as one possible perspective or thought about the question.\nFinally, fill in your perspective and thoughts.\nSelf-concept does not necessarily mean that you have the knowledge and skills to be where you need to be.\nBecause change and transitions are emotionally and psychologically taxing, making a connection between\nthe behavior change and the outcomes can help to ease the transition. In some cases, if an individual is\nnot responding to the change, rewards and reinforcers are used to increase a behavioral response. Even\nadding a compliment can increase a person\u2019s behavior toward However, if a person does not know what\nfuels his or her self-concept, then the challenge in making a transition will be more difficult.\nTable 6.1 Changing Cultural Behaviors\nYour\nQuestions One Perspective/Thoughts Perspective/Thoughts\nHow do Mary and\nJose view personal Mary feels a great need for personal space.

The\nstory is about Lia Lee, the second-youngest daughter who is diagnosed with severe epilepsy. Within\nthe Hmong culture, epilepsy is not described in the same way that Western medical doctors describe\nit; epilepsy is described as qaug dab peg or \u201cthe spirit catches you and you fall down.\u201d According to\nanimism, the foundation for Hmong religious beliefs, both good and bad spirits surround us.\nEpileptic attacks are seen as the ability of an individual to temporarily join the spirit world. This is\nseen as honorable because the spirits have chosen that person to communicate with them.\nThe language used by Hmong and Americans to describe their understanding and knowledge of what\nwas happening to Lia can be referred to as linguistic relativity. Linguistic relativity was first developed\nby Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, and is known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, [2] or the\nprinciple of linguistic relativity. It describes the idea that language influences the perceptions and\nthoughts of people, thus affecting their behavior. In Hmong culture, there is no word for \u201cepilepsy\u201d;\ninstead, the word is associated with the animistic worldview of the Hmong, which serves as a\nphilosophical, religious, and spiritual guide to operating one\u2019s life. The only way to describe epilepsy\nis related to this world view of spirits. In Western medicine and science, rationality, logic, and\nobjectivity are important\u2014scientific words and definitions are not abstract; rather, they are concrete.\nSapir and Whorf argued that individuals are not aware of the influence of language, and it is only\nwhen moving between cultures that individuals become aware. A commonly cited example of\nlinguistic relativity is the example of how Inuit Eskimos describe snow. In English, there is only one\nword for snow, but in the Inuit language, many words are used to describe snow: \u201cwet snow,\u201d\n\u201cclinging snow,\u201d \u201cfrosty snow,\u201d and so on.\nThe following case study further explains the idea behind linguistic relativity:\nCarol serves as a program director for a local nonprofit in the Washington DC area. Her organization has\nreceived a federal grant to implement employment training and resources to serve the large and growing\nSomali population in the area. The grant requires her organization to track outcomes and the impact of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n141 the training program on participants\u2019 lives. Each participant is required to attend an exit interview session\nconducted by a staff person.\nCarol creates a survey that is both qualitative and quantitative to measure the impact. Questions relate to\nthe participant\u2019s experience in the program and ask participants to rate their level of agreement to\nstatements. Table 6.2 \"Survey to Measure Program Impact\" shows sample questions from the quantitative\nsurvey.\nPattie serves as the interviewer for all the sessions. She reads out loud each statement and given the\nresponses, checks the appropriate box. She notices that during the first round of interviews, participants\nare unsure how to respond. They are unclear about the levels of rating given to them: strongly agree,\nagree, disagree, and strongly disagree. Additionally, some of the statements are confusing. She tries to\nexplain the difference but is unsure how to describe the statements differently. She\u2019s frustrated because\nshe\u2019s concerned she\u2019s not getting the right information, and she knows that it must upset the participants.\nTable 6.2 Survey to Measure Program Impact\nStrongly Strongly\nStatements Disagree Disagree Agree Agree\nI know how to use the Internet to find a job.\nI am able to put together a resume for a job.\nWhen I find a job I like, I know how to respond to the job\nposting.\nI know the appropriate questions to ask a potential\nemployer in interviews.\nCarol and Pattie discuss what they could do differently in the survey or process to help the Somali\nparticipants understand the questions. Unfortunately, they do not have an employee on staff that can\ntranslate. In the end, Carol and Pattie decide to change the process and the language barriers in the\ninterview. They decide that pictures may help illustrate a level of agreement. They also agree to take out\nthe \u201cbig words\u201d or words that would further confuse the participants. They also changed the rating scale to\nreflect: yes, no, and maybe. The revised survey had the following questions.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n142 I know how to use the Internet to find a job.\nI know how to create a resume for a job.\nWhen I find a job I like, I know who to call in the company.\nI know what I can and can\u2019t ask in interviews.\nNow imagine that you are Carol\u2019s boss and you have been updated about this situation. What\nsuggestions do you have for Carol and Pattie as they continue their work?\nThere are a number of ways to think about the work. In cultural intelligence, understanding how to\nadapt your behavior is critical. The following are questions that you should think about in order to\nhelp Carol and Pattie adapt their behaviors:\n\uf0b7 What emotions come up for you in this work?\n\uf0b7 Are the emotions negative or positive? How does it fuel your work?\n\uf0b7 What is the influence of language on evaluation?\n\uf0b7 What body language do you notice? What does it tell you? How can it be helpful to our work to\nidentify verbal and nonverbal cues?\n\uf0b7 What are we doing that works?\n\uf0b7 What do we know does not work in this project?\n\uf0b7 What are the learning opportunities for all?\nAsking these questions is a start toward continuing the good work that Carol and Pattie have already\nbegun. As the two move forward in their work and learn more about what works and what does not\nwork, they will learn to ask and reflect on questions that are inclusive to other cultures.\n[1] Fadiman (1998).\n[2] Whorf (1956).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n143 6.4 Behavior and Communication\nOur behaviors are communicated both verbally and nonverbally. Culturally intelligent leaders pay\nattention to both cues. Earley et al. [1] noted, \u201cWhen we meet strangers from other cultures for the\nfirst time, their outward appearances and overt behaviors are the most immediately obvious features,\nnot their hidden thoughts and feelings.\u201d I experienced this when on my first trip from the United\nStates to France.\nIn my mid-20s, I went to France with my family to visit my uncle on my mother\u2019s side. As we\nboarded the flight and found our seats, my father and I had challenges finding an overhead space for\nour bags. Because we did not want to hold up the line of people who needed to pass us to get to their\nseats, we needed some assistance. I explained to my father in our native Hmong language that there\nwere flight attendants who could assist us. Not too far from us, I spotted a flight attendant and said\nto my father, \u201cI think he could help us.\u201d\nMy father, who was distracted and gently being pushed to the side by much taller passengers making\ntheir way to their seats, could not see where the attendant was. I said, while pointing in the direction\nof the attendant, \u201cDad, he\u2019s over there.\u201d My father looked up and, at that same time, I looked over at\nthe flight attendant. We made eye contact, and because the plane was bustling with passengers,\nrather than calling out for assistance, I signaled with my hands for him to come over to us.\nThe next thing I knew, the flight attendant came over. I was so ecstatic to see that he was going to\nhelp us that what he said took me by surprise. \u201cIn our country, we don\u2019t point our fingers at other\npeople. It\u2019s rude.\u201d Because his voice was loud, other passengers turned to look at what was going on.\nCompletely embarrassed, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d He replied curtly, \u201cDon\u2019t ever do this\n[points his finger at me] again.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Thanks for letting me know,\u201d I responded with an apologetic tone. It was certainly not my\nintention to point directly at him, or to call him to us in that manner.\nAfter settling in our seats with the plane on its way to France, I found myself getting emotional about\nthe situation. He thinks I\u2019m rude for pointing? He\u2019s rude for not even letting me explain. Besides, I didn\u2019t\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n144 point my finger at him. I was just pointing in the direction he was standing. And, what\u2019s his problem\nthat he doesn\u2019t know pointing fingers is also rude in America? Does he think I\u2019m NOT from America?\nI describe the emotions I felt as my \u201cemotional hijack\u201d moment, which is when the thalamus in the\nbrain bypasses the \u201cthinking brain\u201d (cortex) and sends signals directly to the amygdala (emotional\nbrain); I took out my journal and deconstructed the situation. It was my way to slow down and\nunderstand what happened; it was an opportunity to think through my thinking.\nFrom this experience, I was reminded of the impact verbal and nonverbal communication has within\nintercultural interactions. And that, sometimes, the intention of your communication does not have\nthe impact that you hoped for.\nSilence\nEdward Hall [2] found that silence serves as a critical communication device and that it is viewed\ndifferently in different cultural contexts; he called these cultural contexts high-context and low-context\ncultures. Societies around the world fall into one or the other cultural context. Hall explained that in high-\ncontext cultures, pauses and silence reflect the thoughts of the speaker whereas, in many European\ncountries, silence can be uncomfortable. Aida Hurtado [3] found that women of color used silence and\noutspokenness as a mechanism of testing knowledge and acquiring new knowledge about social\nenvironments. She argued that women of color use silence as a strategy for obtaining and reconstructing\nknowledge, and the usage of outspokenness compliments silence in \u201cknowing when to talk and just exactly\nwhat to say is especially effective if individuals are not expected to talk.\u201d [4]\nAs culturally intelligent leaders, we have to recognize the moments of silence and their meaning. As an\neducator in the United States, I often come across students in my classroom and training who are from\nhigh-context cultures. The majority of them do not speak unless specifically called out to provide a\nresponse; this differs from my students who are from low-context cultures, such as the United States, who\nconstantly raise their hands and have something to say. The following is another example of silence and\ntalk:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n145 A few years ago, Dr. Osmo Wiio, a communication scholar from Finland came to the United States as a\nvisiting professor. While riding a public bus to the campus, a woman sitting next to him struck up a\nconversation, intending to be friendly. \u201cI see by your clothes that you may be a European. What country\nare you from?\u201d Wiio replied curtly, trying to discourage further conversation: \u201cFinland.\u201d He held his\nnewspaper so as to cover his face. But his fellow passenger stated, \u201cOh, how wonderful! Please tell me all\nabout Finland.\u201d Professor Wiio felt very angry that a complete stranger had initiated a conversation with\nhim. In Finland, a cultural norm discourages striking up conversation with strangers in public places. [5]\nCultural norms can also vary within a country. In some parts of the United States, a stranger attempting\nto initiate a conversation would be treated brusquely, while, in other parts of the country, the same\nstranger would be treated kindly.\nSelf-Disclosure\nIndividual behaviors also differ based on a culture\u2019s notion of self-disclosure, the degree to which\nindividuals share personal information with others. In general, collectivist and high-context cultures do\nnot disclose much, while individualistic and low-context cultures are more self-disclosing. Take, for\nexample, the following case study of a market research company that conducted surveys for their client, a\nhealth clinic:\nActiveSearch, a market research company in the Midwest, was contracted to conduct follow up surveys\nwith patients of a local health clinic. The clinic wanted to improve the quality of services and care\nprovided and especially wanted to receive feedback from their African, Southeast Asian, and Latino\npatients. The phone surveys were short, no more than ten questions that asked about the quality of\nservice, reason(s) for visit, timeliness, and ability of staff to respond knowledgeably and appropriately.\nPhone surveyors made calls to 1000 patients who were seen by the clinic within a six month period. To\nthe surprise of the market research company, they encountered what they perceived in the beginning as\n\u201cresistance\u201d to respond to the satisfaction survey. Results from the surveys were disappointing because\nless than 70 African, Latino, and Southeast Asians participated compared to 638 white patients who\nresponded. After careful evaluation and reflection, the company realized their error. African, Latino, and\nSoutheast Asians patients did not want to share their health concerns with the surveyors; they were\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n146 suspicious of the company. Whereas, white patients were accustomed to taking satisfaction surveys and\ndid not express concerns over how the information would be used.\nActiveSearch mistook the refusal to participate as \u201cresistance.\u201d The company did not realize that the\nAfrican, Latino, and Southeast Asian groups they surveyed had cultural norms that spoke to keeping\ninformation within certain circles. The idea of sharing one\u2019s health issues is considered a private family\nmatter in these groups, and trust was a large issue as well, as they were not sure what the information\nwould be used for. Many respondents may even have thought they would lose their insurance or health\ncare if they gave out information. Understanding the different belief systems that underline the cultural\nnorms of self-disclosure would have been helpful to the business.\nMaintaining Relationships\nIn their communication behaviors, collectivist cultures emphasize the importance of maintaining\nrelationships. They will shape messages that will not be offensive, shaming, or cause a person to lose face.\nTo a person from an individualistic culture, however, the message may be unclear, indirect, and\nambiguous. The following case study provides an example of this:\nSavitha and Mary are new coworkers having worked together for the past six months. Mary feels that she\nwould like to get to know Savitha better. She invites Savitha and other colleagues to a barbeque at her\nhouse. Savitha declines, saying, \u201cThank you but I have a family commitment that day.\u201d Mary understands\nand says, \u201cOf course. Hopefully we can do something another time.\u201d Over the next year, Mary invites\nSavitha on several occasions to join her for coffee, dinner, or social events\u2014sometimes with colleagues\nand sometimes just the two of them. Each time that Mary suggests a time to get together, Savitha\nresponds that she is busy. Savitha says \u201cno\u201d because she also believes that her relationship with Mary\nneeds to stay at a professional level, but she doesn\u2019t tell this to Mary. Mary\u2019s beginning to think that\nSavitha does not like her, and if that\u2019s the case, why doesn\u2019t she just come right out and say that?\nIn this example, Savitha is maintaining what she perceives as a harmonious relationship with her family,\nwhich Mary does not understand. From a collectivist culture, Savitha wants to ensure that the family\nrelationship dynamics are not disturbed. Additionally, she wants to preserve the harmony of a\nprofessional relationship with Mary; rather than disrupt the flow of that relationship, she chooses to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n147 communicate this indirectly to Mary. She does not want Mary to lose face or take offense, yet the results\nare exactly the opposite of what Savitha expects. Mary thinks she is evasive. Both Savitha and Mary can\nlearn about the different ways that different cultures express relationships and maintain healthy\nrelationships. If both were aware of each other\u2019s cultural norms, they could adapt their behaviors.\nThe Concept of Face\nAn important aspect of interpersonal relationships is the concept of face. \u201cFace\u201d is seen as one\u2019s public\nimage in social contexts, and this concept is very important in Asian cultures that have a collectivist\nidentity. These societies are concerned with saving face, or how they will appear to those around them.\nPublic criticisms that can lead to a person losing face may harm the person\u2019s identity and image,\nespecially within their families and communities. Losing face can lead to deadly consequences, as in the\nfollowing example:\nIn August 2007, Mattell was forced to recall over 900,000 plastic toys due to excessive amounts of lead in\nthe paint. Later that month, Zhang Shuhong, the CEO of Lee Der Industrial in China, the manufacturer of\nthe toys, committed suicide after China temporarily banned the company\u2019s exports. A Chinese newspaper\nsaid that a supplier, Zhang\u2019s best friend, sold Lee Der fake paint that was used in the toys. \u201cThe boss and\nthe company were harmed by the paint supplier, the closest friend of our boss,\u201d the report said. It\ncontinued that \u201cin China it is not unusual for disgraced officials to commit suicide.\u201d\nLater that year, in September, Mattel\u2019s Executive Vice President for Worldwide Operations, Thomas\nDebrowski made a public apology to the Chinese government saying, \u201cMattel takes full responsibility for\nthese recalls and apologizes personally to you, the Chinese people and all of our customers who received\nthe toys. It is important for everyone to understand that the vast majority of these products that we\nrecalled were the result of a flaw in Mattel\u2019s design, not through a manufacturing flaw in Chinese\nmanufacturers.\u201d [6]\nAs this case illustrates, this situation even led to Mattel trying to save its face with the Chinese\ngovernment and its people.\nTime\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n148 Time is an important value dimension of culture and, as a result, impacts the behaviors of people. As\ndiscussed in Chapter 2 \"Understanding Culture\", time is regarded in some cultures as punctuality, while,\nin others, time is more relaxed and is viewed as contributing to the building of relationships. The\nfollowing case study illustrates the notion of time and the behaviors of cultures based on their\ninterpretations of time.\nTim, a white man, manages a production department in an American private business. Many of his\nassembly line workers come from the Southeast Asian and Asian cultures. Whenever his employees had a\nproblem, they would want to talk and discuss the project at length. They not only wanted to understand\nthe problem but they wanted to keep harmony in the organization. They would come back to him several\ntimes even after the problem was resolved. For this manager, the problem had a quick solution: he\nprovides the solution and his employees should comply. However, he doesn\u2019t understand why his\nemployees keep coming back to him about the issues. He\u2019s annoyed at the amount of time it is taking to\nmanage the process.\nTim and his employees have been raised with different notions of time. Tim thinks that time is associated\nwith efficiency and effectiveness. To him, when an issue is discussed and a solution is provided, he\nbelieves there should be no further discussion. For his employees, the act of coming back to the problem is\nnot to find more solutions; rather, it is to continue to develop a relationship with the manager\u2014it is to\nensure that the relationship is harmonious and in balance. For them, it is a check-in point in the\nrelationship.\nLeBaron [7] noted that cultural understanding of time can impact conflict management and negotiation\nprocesses. As an example, she described a negotiation process between First Nations people and the local\nCanadian government. She wrote,\nFirst Nations people met with representatives from local, regional, and national governments to\nintroduce themselves and begin their work. During this first meeting, First Nations people took\ntime to tell the stories of their people and their relationships to the land over the past seven\ngenerations. They spoke of the spirit of the land, the kinds of things their people have\ntraditionally done on the land and their sacred connection to it. They spoke in circular ways,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n149 weaving themes, feelings, ideas, and experiences together as they remembered seven generations\ninto the past and projected seven generations forward.\nWhen it was the government representatives\u2019 chance to speak, they projected flow charts showing\ninternal processes for decision-making and spoke in present-focused ways about their intentions\nfor entering the negotiation process. The flow charts were linear and spare in their lack of\nnarrative, arising from the bureaucratic culture from which the government representatives\ncame. Two different conceptions of time: in one, time stretches, loops forward and back, past and\nfuture are both present in this time. In the other, time begins with the present moment and\nextends into the horizon in which the matters at hand will be decided. [8]\nYou can probably guess the result of this meeting. Both sides felt misunderstood and neither was happy\nwith the results. Their world views, including the language used in the negotiation processes, originated\nfrom separate paradigms. Because neither of the groups understood the dimension of time and the\ninfluence of language in their behaviors, it led to decreased trust between them.\n[1] Earley, Ang, & Tan (2006), p. 83.\n[2] Hall (1990).\n[3] Hurtado (1996).\n[4] Hurtado (1996), p. 382.\n[5] Rogers & Steinfatt (1999), p. 151.\n[6] Selko (2007).

In this way,\ncultural intelligence principles are interconnected and interrelated. You must be able to think about\nyour thinking, contemplate it, and then adapt it based on your findings and reflections. Behaviors,\nwhether appropriate or inappropriate, must be identified and defined in objective terms. You have to\nknow exactly what behaviors are reoccurring and why they need to be changed. By doing so, you can\ndescribe the things you say to yourself as well as the situations or behaviors that you are imagining.\nYou can, and should, talk about the evaluation statements you make about yourself. The use of\ncultural strategic thinking and mindfulness can help you to identify your behaviors and thought\npatterns.\nTable 6.3 \"Identifying Behaviors and Thought Patterns\" is a case study of Gillian, who has been\nasked by her supervisor to lead development for a new service in her organization. Observe how she\nanalyzes the situation in order to identify her behavior, the thoughts she had, and the emotions or\nbehavioral outcomes she experienced.\nNext, Gillian decides to find a way to manage her distressing thoughts and emotions. Because her\nanxiety, fear, and nervousness do not serve her as a leader in this work, she needs to identify more\ndesirable thoughts. When she does this, she is less likely to have negative emotional responses that\ncan lead to depressed moods and behaviors. To reframe her behavior, she will ask three questions:\nWhere is the evidence that contributes to my thoughts? Gillian will use this broader question to\nfurther explore her confidence, her ability to manage the team, and whether she has facts that\nsupport her thought pattern.\nAre there other possibilities to this situation? Gillian will use this broader question to explore\nwhat she is not seeing in the situation and whether the facts presented are true, or if there are other\nexplanations.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n151 What are the implications of my behaviors? Gillian will use this broader question to understand\nhow she feels, whether the feelings help or hinder her, if the feelings create a positive end result, and\nwhat consequences would occur because of her resistance to change.\nTable 6.3 Identifying Behaviors and Thought Patterns\nEmotions or\nSituation Thoughts Behaviors\nMy manager placed me in a work group I don\u2019t know if my responses and\nto lead development for a new service in interactions with them will be appropriate. I feel anxious. I am\nour organization. Working with the team I don\u2019t know what to expect because we not as confident in\nrequires that I make several trips to are a new team.

I don\u2019t want to mess this up. control.\nWhen Gillian is able to identify the negative or inappropriate behaviors and identify the behaviors\nshe wants, she is then able to respond and adapt appropriately. Sometimes during the adaptation\nand adjustment period, it is helpful to recite self-statements to cue you in the direction of the positive\nbehaviors you want to express. Peer support can also be helpful in changing minds, because your\npeers can help point out in the situations where you revert back to old behaviors.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n152 6.6 Changing Minds Through Storytelling\nGardner wrote in Changing Minds that to \u201ccapture the attention of a disparate population: create a\ncompelling story, embodying that story in one\u2019s own life, and presenting the story in many different\nformats so that it can eventually topple the counterstories in one\u2019s culture.\u201d [1] Stories can, and do,\nshape culture in positive and negative ways. They help shape processes such as orienting new\nemployees; they can serve as symbols that reinforce norms such as cubicles for employees and suites\nfor executives; or they can create organizational heroes and heroines such as employee stories of\nleaders that go the extra mile.\nStorytelling is an excellent way for leaders to garner staff involvement, bring new clients to an\norganization, or paint a vision of an organization\u2019s future. In its essence, storytelling is about how\nyou communicate your vision, your goal, or your objective to listeners\u2014in other words, storytelling\ncan help you get your point across. Telling different stories can initiate different actions from story\nlisteners, eliciting stories that speak to their behaviors and their experiences.\nThe impact of storytelling in organizations has become increasingly important because stories are\nmemorable, no matter how poorly or well told they are. Emerging research studies show that\nstorytelling has a tremendous affect on an organization\u2019s capacity to grow and manage change.\nOrganizations in transition that use elements of storytelling demonstrated improvements in team\nperformance and in overall project management. Although the research literature on storytelling is\nlimited, the importance of storytelling is being noted on an international level. Stories, like Gardner\nexpressed, are powerful tools, and when the right story is told, leaders can take the proper action\nneeded for intercultural work.\nStorytelling Unites Cultures\nStorytelling is a unique strategy for socializing members into your organization and encouraging them to\nabide by cultural norms and values. This technique is especially helpful in guiding new members in\nunderstanding company values and beliefs. New employees will have assumptions about what to expect in\ntheir first day on the job. They often create their own realities, through their own stories, of what the\norganization is to them based on the behaviors, actions, and attitudes seen, heard, or felt during this\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n153 initial phase. For current employees, storytelling emphasizes the important aspects of an organization\u2019s\nculture that you want them to value and demonstrate in their work. Perhaps these aspects have been\npreviously missing from the organization, and by using storytelling techniques, you automatically bring\npeople together by creating and sharing a common story.\nAs leaders, it is important to cultivate stories that have meaning for employees and to guide members\nback to core values of the organization. For example, a principal of an elementary school may tell the story\nof a student who emulates her teacher in order to reveal how much impact teachers have on children. An\nexecutive director of a nonprofit organization will tell a story of the organization\u2019s founder by describing\nthe founder\u2019s personality, character, and vision to motivate current employees in their work. The choice of\nthe stories, the characters chosen, the timing of the story, and the details emphasized will create\nmemorable stories that stay within the minds of organizational members. Leaders can create\norganizational stories that will be passed on throughout the life cycle of their organizations.\nCulturally intelligent leaders can shape intercultural understanding by utilizing several methods that\naddress the underlying assumptions, beliefs, and values of its members; however, this is not an easy task.\nAs indicated, culture oftentimes consists of unconscious behaviors, values, and assumptions that develop\nover time and changes may occur as new associates enter into the organization. Too often, leaders will\nneglect to solicit information from their employees in building the organization\u2019s culture and values. This\nfallacy, often unintentional, can harm the organization and affect its leadership.\nThe following exercise will help you to identify stories that support intercultural interactions and\nunderstanding of culture in your place of work. By reflecting on these exercises, you will learn what stories\ndrive your organization and what ones might be discarded:\n1. In the space below, list the types of jokes about intercultural work that are told in your organization. If\nyou know the words to the jokes, write them down.\n2. Write down all the common phrases that are spoken in your organization related to intercultural\nunderstanding such as, \u201cHere\u2019s another meeting we\u2019re required to attend on diversity,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll work\nwith this person but only because I have to.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n154 3. Think of one common story that has been told in your organization. It could be a story of why your\norganization thinks diversity and culture is important to the work or why certain people leave the\norganization.\nAs you take a look at your responses, think about the following questions:\n\uf0b7 What are the common stories in your organization?\n\uf0b7 Are the stories generally positive or negative?\n\uf0b7 What is your role in creating these stories?\n\uf0b7 As a leader, what stories, if any, can you change in your organization?\n\uf0b7 What steps, if any, will you take to change your organizational stories?\n[1] Gardner (2004), p. 82.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n155 6.7 Chapter Summary\n\uf0b7 Changing behaviors requires cultural strategic thinking and mindfulness in order to recognize\nwhich behaviors are inappropriate and which are desirable.\n\uf0b7 Self-concept is critical to one\u2019s adaptation. Self-concepts are developed over time, they are\ndynamic, and they are organized.\n\uf0b7 Cognitive dissonance can interrupt one\u2019s self-concept. Dissonance between one\u2019s self-concept and\nwhat is heard or observed causes one to feel uncomfortable, anxious, fearful, and, in the learning\nprocess, makes a person less likely to learn the new information.\n\uf0b7 Adaptation of one\u2019s behaviors requires management of the internal change process and one\u2019s\nresponses to it. Knowledge of your behaviors during change or transitions can help you to identify\nthe emotions and thoughts you have that are counterproductive to your ability to adapt.\n\uf0b7 Linguistic relativity is the idea that language shapes world views and also shapes behaviors.\nWords, and the understanding of words, take on many forms in different cultures; words may be\nunderstood differently in different cultures.\n\uf0b7 Cultures communicate in different ways, and, as a result, the behaviors of people are different. It\nis important that, as a leader, while paying attention to the behaviors, you recognize the intention\nof the communication versus the impact.\n\uf0b7 To change one\u2019s behaviors, you must learn to change your mind. This requires the ability to think\nin a culturally strategic manner and to be mindful of your thoughts and behaviors. Once you\nidentify the situation, the thoughts you have about the situation, and the emotions you feel in the\nsituation, you have a greater chance of changing the behavior.\n\uf0b7 Storytelling is a strategy to use when changing behaviors. Stories can unite people of different\ncultures in recognizing core organizational values.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n156 Chapter 7\nCultural Intelligence in Action\nIn the previous chapters, you have been presented with the three principles of cultural intelligence:\ncultural strategic thinking, motivation, and behavior. This chapter provides case studies [1] of leaders\nand managers who must find solutions to working through intercultural problems and situations.\nEach case study is followed by an activity to help you apply your understanding of the cultural\nintelligence principles; then, it is followed by a list that outlines sample ideas related to the questions\nin the activity. The following are your instructions:\n\uf0b7 Read the case studies.\n\uf0b7 Answer the questions in the activity section.\n\uf0b7 Review ideas.\n[1] These case studies are a combination of real life stories shared by clients and colleagues I have worked with\nover the last 7 years as well as cases from national and international newspapers. Names of organizations and\nindividuals have been replaced and situations have been altered to conceal their identities.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n157 7.1 Case Study 1: Resistance to Change\nVictor is the head of a division in a state agency. He has been in his management position for 15 years\nand has worked his way up to his current position. Throughout his career, he has seen many people\nleave and join the department. He has stayed because he enjoys public service and working with\nfamiliar faces in the agency. He also knows that he brings his many years of experiences in a public\nagency to the table when solving problems. His personality fits the working environment of a state\nagency; he likes working with the familiarity of rules and procedures.\nVictor is proud of his service, but he is really looking forward to his retirement, which, for him, is not\ncoming soon enough. Within the last few years, lots of changes have occurred on a department level\nthat is also changing much of the familiar procedures, rules, and norms that Victor has been\naccustomed to during his 25 years in the department. Some of these changes include hiring younger\nstaff, reorganization of job responsibilities, performance plans to increase staff competencies and\nskills in new areas, and recent layoffs to help balance the budget.\nAs part of his attempt to make his mark on the division, and to bring in past experiences that he\nthinks can be of value, Victor proposed numerous ideas for the division at a staff meeting. His staff\u2014\nwhich, in recent years, has become increasingly more diverse in demographics and cultural\nbackgrounds\u2014suggests improvements and changes to his ideas. They are not so sure that his changes\nare the most appropriate given the overall strategic directions of the department. Furthermore, they\nare not sure how they can implement strategies when the ideas call for outdated resources and\ntechnology. Some of the younger staff members are more vocal and mention recent trends and\npractices in strategic thinking that could be more beneficial to accomplishing the division goals.\nVictor views these suggestions as attacks directed at him and as resistance on the part of the staff. He\nfeels like every time he makes a suggestion, he is thrown a curveball from one of the younger staff\nmembers. Why is this happening to him now? He knows he has to manage this. He cannot let this\ntype of dynamic go on for an additional five years\u2014or could he?\n1. What cultural assumptions fuel Victor\u2019s perspective as a leader of a state agency?\n2. Where does Victor\u2019s motivation to lead come from?\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n158 3. How would you describe Victor\u2019s self-concept and the influence of it on his leadership?\nReflection\nVictor has several cultural assumptions that can be broken down into different cultural levels: individual,\nteam, organizational, and national cultures. His assumptions and beliefs may include any of the following:\nworking hard will get you to the top, everyone must obey rules and procedures, and you must have\nexperience in order to know what you are doing in a job. This could be why he feels attacked when his\nyounger employees make suggestions. It is also important to note that Victor may have been raised in a\nhomogenous culture that did not allow him to interact with others who did not share his same cultural\nvalues and belief. Victor can benefit from learning about his self-concept and how his values contribute to\nhis management. By doing so, Victor helps his team to understand him more.\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: Victor has a lot of knowledge about working in public sector organizations. His tenure in\na state agency makes him very familiar with this type of culture. But he lacks knowledge about\nwhat is unfamiliar to him, particularly around generational issues. He knows what areas of his\nwork frustrate him; now, he needs to acquire information that help him understand why it\nfrustrates him. To improve his cultural intelligence, Victor would need to develop a plan that\nhelps him to become more familiar with the different cultures in his work team.\n\uf0b7 Build: To build his knowledge in cultures, Victor can develop strategies that help him connect his\ncurrent cultural knowledge to the new knowledge he wants to gain. For example, he identifies that\nthe characteristics of a younger generation are new to him. He can put together a plan where he\nmonitors his communication with the staff to gauge whether he is really understanding what is\ngoing on. It is important here that when he builds new knowledge, he is aware of the skills he has\nand what he lacks when working with a younger generation.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: Victor\u2019s self-efficacy is an issue in this cultural situation. He has a few years left\nbefore retirement and considers giving up. He needs to make a shift, changing his attitude from\none of frustration to a positive perspective. He can do this by visualizing the positive end results\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n159 and reminding him that he can and should keep trying. He needs to put in place a plan where he\ncan monitor his internal motivation toward the issue.\n\uf0b7 Do: It seems in this situation that change will be difficult for Victor because he is set in his ways.\nVictor can be mentored and coached to think about change and its impact on his situation by\nasking himself: What is changing, What will be different because of the change, and What will he\nlose? Using these three questions he will learn to identify the change and behaviors that need to\nchange, the potential results of the change, and what beliefs and values he will need to discard in\nthe process. By identifying specific areas of change, Victor can transition better.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n160 7.2 Case Study 2: Young, Confident, and Moving too Fast\nJulia, who is 26 years old, recently graduated from the University of Chicago with her master\u2019s\ndegree in social work. She is a confident young woman who is used to making quick decisions, and\nshe greatly values her independence. She graduated at the top of her class and, throughout her\ncourse of study, was known by her peers and professors as a \u201cgo-to person\u201d for resolving conflicts\nand finding strategic, innovative approaches to social work. She is highly motivated and passionate\nabout social justice and social change issues, particularly those involving poverty and housing.\nShe has high expectations in her career as a social worker and has found a job working with a local\nnonprofit organization that provides transitional housing to people who are homeless. Her boss,\nJoanne, holds her in high regard, but now, in her second month of the job, Julia is increasingly\nannoyed by her boss\u2019s constant micromanagement and questioning of her decisions. \u201cCome to me\nbefore you make a major decision. I don\u2019t want you to move so fast on your own,\u201d Joanne says.\nJulia asks, \u201cHave I made any mistakes so far?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Joanne retorts, \u201cbut I feel that you need to\ncheck in with me before you move on with some projects. You\u2019ve only been here for two months and\nthere\u2019s a lot of stuff you still need to learn.\u201d\n\u201cWell, tell me what they are. I\u2019m eager to learn everything so I can do my job better,\u201d Julia replies.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready yet. There\u2019s a lot to learn about this job. Believe me, I was like you, too,\nwhen I was younger, but over the years I\u2019ve learned that it takes time and patience to do this work.\nIt\u2019s fast paced and working in this field can be emotionally draining. We just can\u2019t afford to make\nmistakes when we do this work.\u201d\nJulia cannot believe what she is hearing. Here she is, eager and motivated to take on more work, and\nJoanne says that it is too overwhelming. She thinks, \u201cWhat kind of work environment is this that won\u2019t\nlet me use skills and knowledge?\u201d\nThis week, Julia is furious. She worked on a slide presentation for a major donor and prepared a\nreport about the progress of the organization\u2019s clients, for which Joanne commended her.\nNevertheless, she was told bluntly that she could not be a part of the donor meeting. \u201cThis is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n161 ridiculous,\u201d Julia thinks. \u201cI\u2019m moving on. I\u2019ll stay here until I get something better, but I sure am\ngoing to start looking around.\u201d\n1. What beliefs and values \u201croot\u201d Joanne and Julia to their self-concepts?\n2. What suggestions do you have for Joanne and Julia when working with a person of another\ngeneration?\n3. How would you suggest Joanne and Julia use the cultural intelligence principles to resolve this\nintercultural situation?\nReflection\nJulia believes she is a fast learner, and she has a high level of confidence. She wants to quickly move up\nthe ladder but feels that Joanne, her manager, is creating barriers. Joanne does not feel this way and\nbelieves that she knows best, given her experiences in the industry. Both Joanne and Julia have beliefs\nabout who they are and what they are capable of doing. Additionally, they both are making assumptions\nabout each other, which leads to their behaviors. It would be helpful to both individuals to conduct an\nexercise that explores their behaviors, the thoughts that accompany the behaviors, and the emotions they\nfeel.\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: Joanne is in a formal position of leadership in this case study. As a leader who wants to\nbe culturally intelligent, Joanne would seek to understand what experiences she has had in the\npast that contribute to her thinking about individuals like Julia. She needs to make the connection\nbetween this information and the new information about what she wants to experience related to\ngenerational culture. It would be helpful for Joanne to think about how she feels and what she\nmight suspect Julia to feel in their interactions. Identifying emotions and feelings can serve as a\ngreat source of feedback to help Joanne comprehend the full picture of the situation.\n\uf0b7 Build: To improve her cultural intelligence, Joanne can seek out a mentor who has worked with\nindividuals like Julia. In CI work, it is important to be able to talk through cultural situations,\nparticularly your plans and goals related to working with different cultural groups. In this\nsituation, a mentor can help Joanne to identify the pieces of culture that she may not be picking\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n162 up such as Julia\u2019s high expectations of herself, her ability to get things done in an informal work\nsetting, and her working style preference.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: Joanne, in this case study, thinks that Julia is very capable to carry out projects and\ntasks. However, she can do more to help build her own self-efficacy as well as Julia\u2019s, thus\nimproving both their cultural intelligence. It is more effective if Joanne schedules weekly\nevaluation and progress sessions with Julia. In this session, Joanne can help Julia to understand\nspecific outcomes and expectations as well as take the opportunity to mentor her. Developing her\ncultural intelligence would mean that Joanne comes to these meetings prepared to provide the\nright type of feedback and recognize when to provide this feedback.\n\uf0b7 Do: Joanne is able to quickly point out to what Julia\u2019s blind spots are in their interactions. But\ndoes Joanne see her own blind spots? In this component of CI, Joanne can and should evaluate\nher own behavior, including what she may not see because she is too focused on whether Julia\nwill make a mistake. Her ability to adapt rests on her acknowledgement of what makes her\nuncomfortable when Julia performs well. Does she hold a belief or attitude about how work can\nbe completed? Or who can do the work?\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n163 7.3 Case Study 3: Building a Multicultural Team\u2014Is it Worth\nit?\nKalia works in a large business, managing a diverse team of eight individuals. Two of her employees\nare in their early 20s, two in their 30s, three in their late 40s, and one in her late 50s. Four members\nof her team are Caucasian and the other four are Hispanic, African American, Asian, and African.\nHer younger employees are fairly new, having been there for less than two years. Most of her team\nmembers have worked with the organization for 5 to 10 years, and her most senior staff has been\nthere for 25 years, 10 years longer than Kalia has been in her leadership position.\nGenerally, team members are cordial to one another on the surface, but Kalia knows that there are\ntensions among some of the staff that have an impact on the success and productiveness of the team.\nShe is aware that one of the younger employees, Robert, is frequently frustrated that his Hispanic co-\nworker, Ana, defers authority and decision making to others in the team. In conversations with him,\nshe discovers that the younger employee feels Ana should express her opinions more often. Robert\u2019s\nfrustration results from his beliefs that everyone on the team should be able to contribute in a\nshared, democratic process. He feels that when Ana defers her decision making to others, she is not\nbeing accountable as a team member.\nMargaret, a senior member of the team has picked up on Robert\u2019s comments and feels that he is\ndisrespectful of Ana\u2019s working style. She has mentioned to him that it could be a \u201ccultural thing\u201d and\nthat he should learn to adapt his behavior and working style to better meet her needs. In response,\nRobert mutters, \u201cWhatever. You don\u2019t know anything about us.\u201d Responses like this have led\nMargaret to believe that he is disrespectful of her knowledge and tenure in the organization.\nFrankly, Kalia is tired of managing people\u2019s personalities. She feels that people should just learn to\nadapt to each other\u2019s working styles. Even though she believes this, she also believes that a good\nleader has to unite the team, no matter their differences and working styles. This year, she has made\nit a goal of hers, and of the team, to resolve these intercultural issues. But given her previous\nattempts, she does not have high hopes for a successful outcome. The last time she tried to resolve\nintercultural team issues, she felt like a complete failure. She is concerned about the employees\u2019\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n164 responses to this next attempt. In fact, every time she thinks about that meeting, she flinches. She\njust did not have the skill sets to facilitate the conversation in their last meeting. She wonders if this\nnext try will progress her team in any way or whether it will just be another failure.\n1. How do you describe Kalia\u2019s self-efficacy?\n2. How does Kalia\u2019s self-efficacy impact her leadership?\n3. What strategies do you recommend to Kalia to help her improve her cultural intelligence?\n4. What suggestions do you have for Kalia in leading her staff to be a culturally intelligent team?\nReflection\nKalia works with a multicultural team, and each member has his or her own individual differences. In a\nsituation like this, it would be helpful for Kalia to explore her motivation and self-efficacy for managing\nmulticultural teams and resolving intercultural conflicts. Her self-efficacy can, and does, have an impact\non her leadership. If her employees sees that she is not confident or able to resolve conflicts, they may\ndisregard the positional power she has as a leader. Because it seems as if she is overwhelmed, it would be\nhelpful to her to break down her goal of creating a culturally intelligent team into manageable, small\ngoals. She can also help others to recognize the basics of cultural differences in the workplace and the\npositive ways in which differences can be used to ignite their work.\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: As a leader, it is important for Kalia to understand the types of individual and team\nculture that are present in her work place. Her frustration about her team is a result of not\nknowing what to do based on her limited perspective of culture. Broadening her viewpoint to\nunderstand the value dimensions of culture such as language, power, authority, and gender can\nhelp her to make more sense of the situation. As Kalia learns this new information, she can\nevaluate her progress by identifying points in her interactions where the value dimensions appear\nand whether she has accurately assessed the situation. Understanding the particulars about\nculture will help her to grasp the cultural dynamics at play.\n\uf0b7 Build: Resolving cultural conflicts can be overwhelming, especially to someone, like Kalia, who\nwants to avoid it. In this situation, Kalia will need to help resolve the conflict among team\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n165 members. She can do this in two ways: first, by helping team members to understand their\nindividual working styles, and in this case, taking the members that have the most conflict aside\nfor discussions. Second, she can help them understand how individual cultures contribute to a\nteam culture by describing the type of team she wants to build. She can mediate the conflict by\nherself or bring in an outside mediator.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: Kalia\u2019s anxiety and self-induced stress is a barrier to her success as a leader. She\nbelieves she does not have the skill sets to facilitate future meetings, and her thoughts are focused\non this point. She cannot shy away from the situation, thus it would be helpful to Kalia to create\nsmaller action steps for her team and herself to meet the larger goal. She would need to stay calm\nand focused on the task.\n\uf0b7 Do: Kalia\u2019s internal motivation will be a huge assistance to her managing the situation. She knows\nshe does not have the skill sets to facilitate the next meeting, but she can find ways to build her\nskills, or she can bring in an outside person to help her mediate. If she chooses to facilitate the\nmeeting on her own, she will need to reflect and identify the skill sets she would need. She can do\nthis by first identifying the thoughts she has related to the situation and the behaviors that\naccompany the thoughts. In doing this, she may find out that she has the skills to facilitate but\nneeds more confidence.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n166 7.4 Case Study 4: A New Leadership Culture\nIt\u2019s been 6 months since Kolab was hired to lead a large, nonprofit organization called, International\nEducation Center (IEC), which provides international education and information to the citizens of a\nMidwestern state. The organization provides opportunities for individuals to learn about different\ncultures and to gain an understanding about their role as citizens of the world. It does this by\nconnecting the people of the state with visitors from all over the world in order to meet and learn\nfrom one another.\nPrior to the job at the IEC, Kolab directed national programming and services for the Office of\nRefugee Resettlement (ORR) in Washington, D.C. Before her job at the ORR, she worked for an\ninternational relief agency and traveled extensively throughout Southeast Asia and Africa, working in\nthe organization\u2019s field offices, managing its daily operations.\nKolab, born in Cambodia, fled with her parents to the United States as refugees during the regime of\nPol Pot and the Khmer Rouge (the followers of the Communist Party who ruled Cambodia from the\n1975-1979). Her experiences growing up as a refugee fuel her motivation and passion for\ninternational work. It also shaped her expectations and working style. She is known to her colleagues\nas a \u201cgo-getter\u201d and a \u201chigh performer.\u201d\nThe board of trustees thought Kolab\u2019s international experiences and goal-oriented, achievement-\nfocused attitude was just what they needed to expand the organization on a national level. The\nprevious president, Hanh, did not have the strategic thinking and vision to move IEC, even though\nshe was very effective at building relationships throughout the state. After 10 years with IEC, Hanh\ndecided to step down from her leadership role. This gave the board of directors an opportunity to\nhire someone like Kolab who can challenge employees and push the organization to reach its\nfinancial and fundraising goals.\nSince Kolab\u2019s hire, employee productivity and motivation has decreased. Staff used to enjoy coming\nto work, talking with one another, and planning programs and services for the community. Now they\ncome to work because \u201cwe need a paycheck,\u201d and they accomplish their tasks because \u201cKolab told me\nto do so.\u201d There is no enthusiasm for the mission of the organization and the vision for the new work\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n167 that Kolab and the directors created in a strategic planning meeting. A couple of times, when Kolab\npassed employee cubicles, she heard comments like, \u201cShe works us all like we don\u2019t have a personal\nlife,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s so impersonable,\u201d \u201cI miss just chatting with people,\u201d and \u201cHanh was never like this. She\nalways made time to talk to us.\u201d\nJust last week, Kolab had a staff meeting, and the majority of staff sauntered in late. Throughout the\nmeeting, they gave her blank stares, and, as soon as the meeting was over, they quickly left. Kolab is\ntired of the staff attitudes and behaviors. \u201cThe culture of this organization can\u2019t operate the way it\nused to. I am determined to change it,\u201d she thinks to herself.\n1. How does Kolab\u2019s self-concept influence her ability to lead?\n2. What cultural value dimensions does the organization operate under? What about Kolab?\n3. What cultural intelligence strategies do you recommend for Kolab and her employees?\nReflection\nThere are several issues here that Kolab needs to work through. First, Kolab has a specific leadership style\nthat she likes to use. Her style is task- and goal-oriented, and is influenced by her upbringing. Her beliefs\nand her attitude is exactly what the board wants, but it is drastically different than the leadership style\nand organizational culture that is familiar to the employees. Second, Kolab wants the culture of the\norganization to move toward accountability, goals, and achievement; this is not to say that the\norganization was not goal-oriented before. Kolab\u2019s vision for the organization\u2019s goals, and how to get\nthere, is a departure from what the cultural norm dictated in the past. Third, the staff has a self-concept\nthat was developed as a result of Hanh\u2019s leadership influence. They are feeling a dissonance between their\nself-concept and the new one that Kolab wants to enforce. Kolab would need to address all these areas and\nfind strategies that help to keep her staff motivated during this time of change.\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: There are multiple levels of culture at work in this case study, particularly how individual\ncultural differences are expressed and interpreted. Kolab has an approach to work that differs\nfrom her employees; most of the approach is based on her personal experiences and history as a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n168 refugee. As a leader practicing cultural intelligence, Kolab will need to take a look at her self-\nconcept and how it differs or corresponds with her staff. She can do this in two ways: first, by\nexploring her own personal history and second, by getting to know her staff as individuals. The\nknowledge she gains about herself and others will bridge her understanding of individual cultural\ndifferences and how they are expressed in an organization.\n\uf0b7 Build: Kolab was hired because she is a \u201cgo-getter,\u201d which typically means that she is achievement\nfocused and oriented. Her staff interprets this as \u201cimpersonable.\u201d To build an understanding of\ncultural differences, Kolab can build into her personal development plan ways to observe and\nlisten to her staff. As an observer, she can pick up on verbal and nonverbal cues in her\nenvironment, thus helping her pay attention to her surroundings. By actively listening to her staff,\nshe will learn how to adapt her behavior appropriately for the situation she is in.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: Kolab has a high ability to be resilient, which she developed as part of her\npersonality and individual culture because of her experience as a refugee. This will be helpful to\nher in staying positive about the situation. However, one of the things she could improve on is her\nability to gauge the emotions of her staff during their interactions. She is not accurately perceiving\nthe thoughts and emotions, thus she is unable to handle the relationships in a way that is\nappropriate.\n\uf0b7 Do: Kolab is trying to change the culture of the organization. As a leader, she needs to recognize\nthat cultural shifts can be difficult, and it is her responsibility as a leader to help her employees\nmake the changes successfully. She can help change cultural behavior through the use of stories.\nShe can strategize this in different ways. She can set time for people to share the stories of the \u201cold\nculture\u201d and what they would like to see in the new culture. She can, using the power of words and\nlanguage, share stories of herself, her vision, and where she would like the organization to be. She\ncan combine her stories with the stories of her employees to create a unified story.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n169 7.5 Case Study 5: Marketing the Right Messages\nDiane is the president of a public relations and marketing company that is in its 10th year of\nbusiness. The company has a wide range of clients in the government, in private businesses, and in\nthe nonprofit sector. It provides media strategies, designs and develops media campaigns, and\nadvises companies with their marketing plans.\nRecently, she negotiated a contract with a local nonprofit organization interested in creating a media\ncampaign to address domestic abuse and violence issues in disadvantaged communities. The\nnonprofit provides transitional housing, mental health services, and counseling and education to\nwomen and children seeking safety from their abusers. Residents are primarily women and children,\nof which 87% are African American, 10% are Hispanic, and 3% are Asians.\nThe nonprofit wants to reach out to the Hispanic and Asian communities. They want to provide\ninformation and education, and create awareness in the communities about their services. Felicia,\nthe executive director, described to Diane what they have already done as an organization and the\nchallenges they have encountered. She identifies these challenges as English language barriers, trust\nissues working with an organization not in their community, and different ways that the cultures\nrespond to domestic violence and abuse issues. Felicia wants a campaign that will break these\nbarriers and give the organization an opportunity to begin working with Hispanic and Asian\ncommunities.\nDiane\u2019s company has never worked on a media campaign such as the one presented to her. Although\nthey have done campaigns and advised on strategies in the social services field, the topic of domestic\nabuse and violence, especially in Hispanic and Asian communities, is new to her and her employees.\nShe is not worried about reaching the African American community, since she is from that\ncommunity and has been successful in creating a variety of strategies and campaigns.\nShe knows that her employees will need to do some research before creating media messages that\nspeak to the Hispanic and Asian markets. She is up for the challenge and thinks this project will\nexpand the company in a new and exciting direction. In addition, it will help her staff improve their\nknowledge and work with the diverse communities within their city.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n170 1. How can Diane and her employees use the idea of \u201cself-concept\u201d to help them in their work?\n2. What cultural value dimensions should Diane and her employees be aware of when working with\nHispanic and Asian communities?\nReflection\nDiane knows that there is culturally specific information and knowledge missing in her organization that\ncould help the business execute a media campaign. Using cultural strategic thinking, she can outline the\noutcomes of what she wants to achieve by looking at the gaps. Diane\u2019s team can also use Hofstede\u2019s\ncultural value dimensions to gain an understanding of each cultural group. By doing this, they can learn\nabout the nature of power, relationships, and identity that exists in each group. They may find that one\ncultural value dimension takes more precedence than others in a cultural group. As a result of their\ncultural strategic thinking, they will come to learn about themselves as an organization and as individuals.\nWhen they do this, they will be better prepared to serve the client and the community.\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: Diane and her team can acquire cultural knowledge by identifying what they currently\nknow and what they would like to learn. For example, if they know the communities they need to\nreach have language challenges, the team can describe what they would like to learn to overcome\nthose barriers. Based on this first piece, the team can develop strategies to bridge the gaps\nbetween their knowledge. As they implement the plan, they can monitor and evaluate the success\nof the strategies.\n\uf0b7 Build: It may be helpful to Diane and her team to create an advisory group of people from the\ncommunities they would like to reach. A group like this can provide them with peer learning\nopportunities and offer guidance in the project. Additionally, they can build their cultural\nintelligence by attending local events or talking to people from the communities they will market\nto. This provides them with an opportunity to check their assumptions and gather cultural\ninformation and facts.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: Diane seems ready to address the challenges, thus indicating that she is motivated\nand confident that herself and her team will end up successful. To keep their spirits high, the team\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n171 can identify moments of success from past projects as well as identify current successes. Creating\nenvironments where her team feels successful in their job and accomplishment of goals will help\nDiane and her team to stay positive and focused. Doing this helps to increase their levels of self-\nefficacy and mindfulness.\n\uf0b7 Do: As the team performs their strategies, their focus must be on cultivating respectful\nrelationships with the communities. Diane and her team will need to pay attention to how\nrelationships are developed as well as how relationships are interpreted within the communities.\nUnderstanding this helps them shape messages that are not offensive or shaming.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n172 7.6 Case Study 6: On Opposite Political Sides\n\u201cDid you see last night\u2019s primary?\u201d Scott says to his staff during their morning coffee break as a team.\n\u201cYeah. McAllister is going down! That \u2018lefty\u2019 annoys me. Talking about big government and ways to\nspend our hard earned money. No one in their right mind will vote for him. I\u2019ll be celebrating when\nhe loses come November,\u201d Joe notes.\nScott replies, \u201cIf this liberal trend keeps up we won\u2019t have any more freedoms. None of us will have\njobs when big government steps in.\u201d He sees his colleagues nodding their heads enthusiastically and\nhears echoes from his team, \u201cYep, that\u2019s right.\u201d\nScott notices that Amber, who he hired as a sales assistant to the team, is quiet. Maybe she is one of\nthem, he thinks. \u201cHey Amber, you\u2019re kind of looking quiet over there. What are you, red or blue?\u201d\nAmber is a bit hesitant. This is her first professional experience since graduating from college 6\nmonths ago. Most of her teammates are in their mid 40s and have been working with the company\nfor 10 years or more. She does not want any ill feelings, but she also does not agree with the language\nthat is used and the conversation. She certainly does not want to create a bad image of her to her\nboss. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about big taxes. I just don\u2019t like the views of the new GOP candidate,\u201d\nshe says, carefully.\nScott quickly replies, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. If you\u2019re voting liberal you\u2019re going to bankrupt our\ncountry, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\nAmber is taken back by the fierceness in her boss\u2019s tone of voice and decides she will not participate\nin conversations like this anymore. However, in the next couple of months, her team finds ways to\ncomment about her political views. They have even nicknamed her, calling her \u201cLefty.\u201d She finds it\ndisturbing that every time she speaks up about her viewpoints, her team instantly fires back with a\ncounterargument\u2014Scott included. When she has gently brought up the issue to her team, they laugh\nand say, \u201cWe\u2019re just joking. Don\u2019t be so sensitive, Lefty.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n173 Over time, Amber\u2019s motivation and passion for her work decreases. She has become more guarded in\nher comments, and, at times, she argues back with just as much passion as the others. On the\nsurface, the team gets along but the tensions impact their work together. Amber notices it but is\nafraid to say anything to Scott. She decides she wants to find another job\u2014it is just easier that way.\n1. What values and beliefs shape the behaviors of the sales team?\n2. How is Scott\u2019s leadership behavior impacting the team?\n3. As Scott\u2019s supervisor, what suggestions or course of actions would you take with Scott?\nAs a leader, Scott needs to evaluate his self-concept and the impact it has on the team\u2019s culture.\nHaving awareness for how he learned his belief systems and the ways in which the beliefs and\nattitudes influence the team environment can help Scott to build a more inclusive team. As a leader,\nhe needs to build all areas of his cultural intelligence (CI) including helping his team to understand\ntheir ability to work with different cultural situations. If they do not, they isolate anyone who is a part\nof their team that does not hold the same political beliefs.\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: First, he must determine the gaps in knowledge that he and his team members have\nrelated to different political beliefs. Many of his team members operate from one particular belief\nsystem, which they now consider a team characteristic and norm. Using cultural strategic\nthinking, he could assess the team\u2019s understanding of culture, the gaps in knowledge, and create a\nvision or goal for what they would like to achieve around cultural understanding.\n\uf0b7 Build: A useful exercise for the team would be to help them change the types of questions they ask\neach other. Making the shift from judgment to learning can provide them with a different\nperspective. For example, rather than ask a judgment question like \u201cAre you with us or not?\u201d Scott\nand his team can ask learning questions such as, \u201cHelp me to understand why you agree with the\nother candidate.\u201d\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: Using mindfulness techniques, the team can evaluate how the political\nconversations and belief systems \u201cbox them\u201d into a specific way of thinking about their worlds.\nThis would require that they are active listeners and observers of the conversation, suspending\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n174 their judgments of other beliefs and norms. It would serve them well to also learn how to manage\ntheir emotions and be able to adapt their behaviors by recognizing the emotions of others.\n\uf0b7 Do: Finally, it would also be useful if Scott and his team took part in an exercise to identify the\nbehaviors that are disruptive and inappropriate. Once the behaviors are called out, they could\nassess the thought patterns that support the behaviors and the emotions that arise because of the\nbehaviors.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n175 7.7 Case Study 7: From Hometown to Global Village\nCommunity Action and Development (CAD) is an economic development center located in a small\ntown a few miles outside of Fargo, North Dakota. Lori has served as its president for the past 10\nyears. The organization is a resource and business development center that brings local, regional,\ncounty, and community leaders together to partner on economic growth strategies for the region.\nOver the years, the organization has successfully created business financing programs, small\nbusiness incubation, and new jobs, and it has established career and employment services to support\nlocal and regional business retention.\nHaving lived in North Dakota all her life, Lori has noticed a visible cultural change in the area. With\nseveral universities and colleges in the area that attract a diverse student body, an increasingly\ngrowing population of immigrants and refugees, and a large number of Native Americans, Lori\nknows that CAD will need to think differently about its work and who it serves. Leaders from\ndifferent cultural communities have already approached the organization about potential initiatives\nto help develop business programs for their groups.\nLori knows that the diversity of changes can only be of benefit to North Dakota. She has read reports\nby the state demographer and has researched population changes in the United States, and she feels\nthat CAD must make strategic decisions to embrace and involve the different communities in the\narea. If they time it right, CAD could be seen as a leader in developing services and programs that\nmeet the needs of immigrant and Native American populations. Not only that, the labor shortage\nthat North Dakota has seen in recent years, due to an aging population, could be addressed if the\ncenter worked on developing a new generation of workers.\nAlthough there are many challenges to this work, there is one significant challenge that Lori is most\nconcerned about. Her board of directors and many leaders in the community are fearful of the\ndemographic changes. People are most concerned about illegal immigration as well as the perceived\nloss of German and Scandinavian culture. Lori has brought her ideas to the board; each time, she has\nbeen told, \u201cWe have to be careful with this issue\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re doing just fine with our programs.\u201d The\nboard chair has even told Lori directly, \u201cWe have to respond to our constituents\u2019 concerns and right\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n176 now they don\u2019t feel this is an issue they want to tackle. Let\u2019s focus on them and their businesses.\u201d\nLori argued, \u201cBut, the new immigrants are our constituents too! We can\u2019t ignore them. And, we\nhaven\u2019t done all we can to help bridge trust and understanding between ourselves and the Native\nAmerican tribes here. We can\u2019t keep going in this direction when the fact is that our community is\nchanging.\u201d\nLori has recently learned about cultural intelligence (CI) as a tool in business. She wants to introduce\nthe idea of CI to her board and staff. She thinks it will be useful for them to understand the cultural\nshifts the community is undergoing and to recognize their values and beliefs. What suggestions do\nyou have for her as she implements the CI principles in her place of work?\nReflection\nLori knows that she has to be careful when talking to her board of directors. There is already tension\nabout cultural diversity issues and lack of awareness of the changing demographics. Many in her town feel\nthreatened and do not pay attention to the changes. Lori has several challenges ahead of her, but there are\nseveral things she can do to make progress toward her goal:\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: She can use her experience and research around data collection to demonstrate the\ndifferent ways in which the community is changing. Using data enables her to bring concrete facts\nto the table. Additionally, she can evaluate the board\u2019s understanding of culture and how cultural\ndifferences are played out in the community.\n\uf0b7 Build: Lori has the opportunity to find allies and supporters of her goal who have positional\npower or influence with board members. She can also find members on the board that can sway\nor influence others to a different perspective. These strategies can help move her closer to her goal\nand help the board recognize the importance of cultural changes in the community.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: She can help her board build their self-efficacy. Because they fear the ambiguity\nthat change brings, she can develop systems or processes that enable her board to build their self-\nconfidence. Additionally, if the board feels any anxiety or stress related to the cultural changes,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n177 she can help create a positive environment, gently reminding them of their successes when\nworking with similar cultural situations.\n\uf0b7 Do: An exercise to identify cultural changes, the results of the changes, and what can be lost or\ngained because of change would be helpful to this organization. Through this process, board\nmembers can specifically identify and articulate where their resistance lies. Additionally, Lori has\nthe task of painting a different picture of change for the board members that are resistant. She\nwill need to select her words carefully and be mindful of how she communicates and responds to\nboard members. She can adapt her behavior and how she communicates to be less threatening to\nboard members who fear change. Paying attention to the verbal and nonverbal cues she receives\nfrom the board can move her one step closer to her goals.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n178 7.8 Case Study 8: No Dogs Allowed\nA teenaged girl, Mary, enters the Ellendale County Public Library with a small dog and heads to the\n\u201cteen books\u201d area. She sits down at one of the tables, opens up her backpack, and takes out a\ntextbook and piece of paper. Her dog is next to her, on the floor.\nAt a table next to Mary sits Ron and his mother, Alice. Ron\u2019s mother is helping him with research for\nschool. She notices the dog, gets up, and looks for a librarian. Upon finding one, she says, \u201cMy son is\nallergic to dogs and that girl brought a dog to the library. He\u2019s not going to be able to study with the\ndog around. Can you do something about this?\u201d\nSusan, the librarian, knows that the library has a \u201cno animal policy,\u201d except for service dogs. The\npolicy also states that the library cannot directly question patrons if the dog is a service dog. Susan\nlooks over at Mary and does not see any visible reasons for why the dog should be there. She heads\nover and tells Mary that she cannot have a dog in the library.\nMary does not understand everything the librarian says because she is hearing impaired. She needs\nthe dog to alert her to things she cannot hear. Mary responds, but Susan does not understand Mary\u2019s\nspeech patterns.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re going to have to leave,\u201d Susan says with finality.\nLater that day, Craig, the director of the Ellendale County Public Library system, receives a phone\ncall from Mary\u2019s father, Joseph, who informs him about the situation. Craig\u2019s been in his position for\n3 years and with the county library for 10 years. As he listens to Joseph, he realizes that there needs\nto be some changes to the library\u2019s policy and training for the librarians. He is going to bring up this\nissue at next week\u2019s management meeting and have a conversation about strategies that will resolve\nthese issues in the future.\nTo help Craig prepare for his management team meeting, use the cultural intelligence principles to\nhelp him analyze the situation that has occurred. You may use the following questions to guide your\nthinking:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n179 1. What does Craig need to help him think through this situation?\n2. What is the culture of the library? The culture of librarians at Ellendale?\n3. What behaviors can you identify? What can Craig and his management team do differently that will\nchange this behavior?\n4. How can Craig and his team use self-efficacy concepts to improve their cultural intelligence?\nReflection\nThere are several items at play in this situation that Craig needs to understand when speaking with his\nstaff:\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: Craig received information only from a patron, Joseph. He is disturbed at what he hears\nand jumps to his own conclusions about what needs to be done. It would be appropriate to hear\nfrom the librarians and others at the library about the situation. Moreover, Craig and his team\nneed to evaluate their own cultural intelligence when working with people who have disabilities.\n\uf0b7 Build: Cultural strategic thinking can help them assess what gaps exist in their knowledge and\nunderstanding of people who have disabilities. As a result of the assessment, they could identify\norganizational goals that would be beneficial to all staff, whether these goals are related to\ntraining, policy changes, behavioral changes, or customer service improvements.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: The mindfulness aspect of contemplation will be useful to Craig and his team.\nMindfulness opens up possibilities in what seems like a closed ended situation. Using\nmindfulness as a tool, it is apparent here that there is a need for cultural sensitivity training for\nthe librarians. But there is also a larger issue: the policies for patrons with disabilities need to be\nreviewed and reconsidered. It would be helpful for the management team to discuss how long ago\nthe policies were created, what changes in the environment the library can expect (in terms of\ndemographic and economic changes) that might impact their policies, and what the protocol is for\naddressing issues that are not included in the library\u2019s policies.\n\uf0b7 Do: For Craig\u2019s team to be more adaptable, it would be helpful for them to understand their self-\nconcepts, including the organization\u2019s self-concept. How has the organization come to understand\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n180 who they are based on their expectations and responses to their patrons? How have policies been\ndeveloped as a result of these responses? Where does our organizational self-concept restrict us\nand create barriers to a successful change? Asking these learning questions can help them shift\ntheir thinking to a different perspective.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n181 7.9 Case Study 9: Faith and Health\nAbdul Hadi is one of the 3 million Muslims living in Germany today. He has had surgery and is\nrecovering from his operations in a hospital near his home. Anna is his nurse and is increasingly\nfrustrated with his behavior and having to accommodate his needs. His behaviors and needs are as\nfollows:\n\uf0b7 Because of the nature of Abdul Hadi\u2019s surgery, it is difficult for him to take a shower or bathe\nhimself. When preparing for prayer, he needs to cleanse himself. He needs assistance and Anna is\nthere to provide help, but he refuses to have her help. Finding a male nurse to help bathe Abdul\nHadi has been a challenge, as all of the male nurses work different shifts and are already assigned\nto other patients.\n\uf0b7 As a devout Muslim, Abdul Hadi does not eat pork. Medication provided to him must not have\nany pork products or alcoholic substances; he is only allowed specific medications and treatments\ncontaining these products as dictated by Islamic law.\n\uf0b7 Abdul Hadi also has special dietary needs. Because much of the cafeteria food contains pork\nproducts, gelatin, or lard, in one form or another, it is hard to find food that fits his needs while\nensuring he stays healthy and strong.\n\uf0b7 Abdul Hadi has many relatives that visit him; as a result, the patients that share his room\ncomplain about the noise and level of activity.\n\uf0b7 As a Muslim, he prays and needs the space to do this. He needs to have a nurse help him get out\nof bed. Sometimes he has called Anna to help him, but because she is attending other patients,\nshe does not come in time to assist him.\nYou are Anna\u2019s supervisor. You want her to be able to work with Abdul Hadi and to provide him with\nthe best care.\n1. Using what you know about cultural intelligence, analyze the situation.\n2. For each of the five behaviors and needs outlined above, find a strategy, or strategies, to resolve the\nissues.\n3. Determine what your hospital needs to do to ensure patients are addressed with care and compassion.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n182 CI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: It is important for the supervisors, including the hospital administrators, to recognize\nthe cultural differences that exist between themselves and people of the Islamic faith. There is a\nspecific belief and value system operating within this hospital. This system dictates how to\ninteract with and treat patients, and as a result, policies are developed to treat and work with\npatients in a specific way. These ideas come into conflict when there are individuals who do not\nperceive care in the same way. A useful exercise for the supervisor and hospital administrators\nwould be to identify what they currently know about the Islamic culture and what they would like\nto learn more about. This can include identification of organizational cultural belief systems and\nvalues related to working with patients. When they do this, it helps them to create concrete\nstrategies for improvement.\n\uf0b7 Build: For Anna, the supervisor can help her to assess her self-efficacy and confidence level in\nworking with patients of different cultural and religious backgrounds. She can work with Anna to\nhelp her become a more active listener, so as to build a more trusting and respectful relationship\nwith patients. The supervisor can also help Anna by coaching or mentoring her, which entails\nasking her questions, making suggestions, and exploring alternative care techniques. Doing this\nprovides Anna and the supervisor with the opportunity to break down what is happening in the\nsituation.\n\uf0b7 Contemplate: It would be important for Anna to keep an open mind and suspend judgments\nabout patient\u2019s beliefs and religious practices. She can learn to be a better observer and listener,\nthus allowing her to pick up cultural nuances that she may not have otherwise noticed. Her ability\nto manage her emotions, gauge the patient\u2019s emotions, and adapt as needed is really important in\nthe care of patients. Because illnesses can be a large source of physical and emotional stress,\nAnna\u2019s assistance in helping patients to manage their emotional responses could only benefit her.\n\uf0b7 Do: The supervisor can help Anna to learn to identify behaviors that are inappropriate and are a\nsetback to the patient\u2019s health and well-being. Learning to name the emotions and identify the\nthought patterns that occur while working with Abdul Hadi can help Anna to release negative\nemotions and feelings she has toward the patient.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n183 7.10 Case Study 10: An Old Boy\u2019s Club\nPattie works as a corporate lawyer at Hannigan, Fisher, and Schultz, a firm known for its work in\nintellectual property and securities law. Prior to her job, she served as a corporate attorney for a large\nFortune 500 company located in San Jose, California. She is the mother of two young boys, 7 and 4\nyears old. Her husband works a full-time job as a financial manager for a prestigious financial\nservices company. Even though Pattie and her husband lead busy professional lives, they always\nmake sure that their two children come first. Jack, the younger of the two, was diagnosed with severe\nepilepsy 2 years ago, and the family wants to ensure that Jack receives the best care and attention.\nIn the past 7 years that Pattie has been with the firm, she has done everything she can to be\npromoted to partner. She has developed a large network of professional relationships. She has\nworked hard to demonstrate her leadership and management potential to her supervisors, and has\nled multi-million-dollar team projects. She has brought in new business and meets all her billable\nhours. She does all this while attending to her family\u2019s special needs.\nThis year, only two associates were promoted to partner; both were men, both with the firm for less\nthan 5 years. When she learned of this, she spoke with Robert, a senior partner and close colleague of\nhers: \u201cRobert, what\u2019s going on here? I\u2019ve been here for six years, done everything according to the\nbook, and yet I get passed up? I thought you said you were going to go to bat for me this year?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Robert hesitates and says, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s hard to convince a bunch of old guys that you\u2019re\ncommitted to your job.\u201d\n\u201cCommitment? What are you talking about? You, of all people, know how hard I work,\u201d Pattie\nreplies. \u201cWait a minute. Is this about me working from home to take care of Jack this year?\u201d\n\u201cListen, it\u2019s a tough world out here. They just want to know you\u2019re going to be there for them; you\nknow, keep bringing in the money. That\u2019s how it is around here. It\u2019s a \u2018do as we say or there\u2019s the\ndoor\u2019 attitude around here. I\u2019m sorry Pattie, but I\u2019ll do what I can to support you\u2014just hang in there.\u201d\nUsing your knowledge about cultural intelligence principles, analyze what you believe is happening\nin this firm, and then identify three suggestions you have for the leadership of this organization.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n184 Reflection\nPattie works in a male-dominated law firm that seems to be entrenched in beliefs and values about\nwomen\u2019s work and the work of attorneys. Although she has an ally in Robert, she still feels alone and\ndiscriminated against. In a situation such as this, Robert and Pattie would need to bring to the attention of\ntheir managers the subtle and insidious ways in which gender inequality occurs in the firm. This is a huge\nchallenge, especially when partners in the firm do not see the problem or they view the problem as\nsomething different than gender equality.\nHere is a situation in which Pattie must evaluate her beliefs and values and whether they align with the\nculture of the law firm. She needs to determine whether it is worth it for her to stay at the law firm or to\nbring more attention to the issue. Since she has Robert as an ally, and since he is a senior partner in the\nfirm, he can be the support and advocate she needs to bring attention to the issue. Additionally, because\nof his position, he has the power to bring awareness of gender inequality issues to his managers and\ncolleagues.\nCI Model in Action\n\uf0b7 Acquire: In a situation like this, organizational leaders need to shift the way they think about\nwomen\u2019s work as attorneys. There are specific beliefs and values involved, unexpressed but felt by\nPattie and most likely other women in the firm. The firm of Hannigan, Fisher, and Schultz must\nrecognize the cultural norms that sustain the behaviors. Because Robert is Pattie\u2019s ally and a\nsenior partner, he can advocate for her, but he needs to know what cultural dynamics are\noccurring in the organization to be able to articulate and communicate the issues to his\nsupervisors. As he makes his case, he can ask himself questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the big picture?\u201d or\n\u201cWhat\u2019s possible here?\u201d\n\uf0b7 Build: Robert can continue to support Pattie by acting as a coach or mentor. But, in his role as\ncoach or mentor, he must pay attention to the cultural elements such as her gender, age, legal\nexperience, and seniority in the firm, even the organization\u2019s culture. These cultural elements will\nlikely impact the types of suggestions he has for her and the kind of support he can give her.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n185 \uf0b7 Contemplate: In this situation, because the organization is entrenched in very specific belief and\nvalue systems, Pattie may never get to be a partner. She will need to consider what keeps her\nmotivated to be in the job and why she would want to work for the firm. She cannot allow the\nsituation to lower her self-efficacy; rather, she must make the most of it given her situation. As\nshe learns more about her values and goals (self-concept), she may find that she no longer wants\nto work in the firm.\n\uf0b7 Do: Because Pattie cannot change the minds of her employers, the best she can do is to\nunderstand who she is in the situation and how she wants to manage it. She can make the\nsituation worse by holding a negative attitude or she can choose to manage her emotions\neffectively until she decides what to do. Opening herself to other possibilities might seem\nchallenging given her family situation; but as she adapts to the changes in her life, she will\neventually transition into a better place.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n186 Chapter 8\nThe Future of Cultural Intelligence\nOne day an elephant saw a hummingbird lying flat on its back on the ground; its feet in the air.\n\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d asked the elephant.\nThe hummingbird replied, \u201cI heard that the sky might fall today. If that happens, I am ready to do my\npart to hold it up.\u201d\nThe elephant laughed and mocked the bird. \u201cYou think those feet can hold up the sky?\u201d\n\u201cNot alone,\u201d said the bird. \u201cBut we must each do what we can, and this is what I can do.\u201d\n- Adapted from R. MacDonald, Three minute tales\nHow can we ensure that our leadership matters at a very deep level? What can we do to cultivate\nawareness for cultural intelligence in all individuals within our organizations? As this Chinese fable\ntells, we have a responsibility to one another.\nThis book began with the idea that there are important factors changing the way we do our work, the\nway we connect with one another, and how we perceive one another. Technological, political, and\nenvironmental changes are fueling a global economy that is quickly flattening; our interdependence\nwith one another goes beyond our relationships in the workplace. All of these factors create new\nworld experiences.\nWhen asked to describe the \u201cperson of tomorrow,\u201d Carl Rogers, [1] one of the founders of the field of\nhumanistic psychology, said that in the new world, people will have a desire for creating wholeness\nin life, thought, and feelings. This \u201cperson of tomorrow\u201d will have a need to find and create new\nexperiences that bring a deeper understanding of humanity to work. Similarly, Frances Hasselbein,\nthe former CEO of Girl Scouts, said that people in our societies are looking to find themselves. There\nis a thirst for personal and inner knowledge and a thirst to understand how this information will\nuncover a more profound awareness for how we relate to one another.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n187 There are four areas in which cultural intelligence will significantly improve our understanding of\nculture and intercultural work. These areas are reframing, adaptive work, systems thinking, and\nconsciousness.\n[1] Rogers (1980), p. 350.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n188 8.1 Reframing\nLeaders must be able to reframe their thinking and practice of culture. Cultural intelligence is a tool\nthat helps move leaders from a place of single perspective to one that has multiple filters for sorting\nthrough and navigating the cultural intelligence labyrinth. The idea and the practice of shifting your\nperspective (reframing) [1] allows leaders to move from mindlessness to mindfulness. It enables\nleaders to identify old thought patterns that lead to destructive and negative behaviors, which, in\nturn, impact and influence one\u2019s leadership.\nOne of the areas that cultural intelligence can help us reframe is the changing demographics and\nenvironmental landscape we experience as a society. As we see globalization\u2019s effects in the world, we\nmust reframe how to think about and include different stakeholders in our work. Who we involve\nmatters. Who we ask to be part of the conversation matters. And, most importantly, how we engage\nthem is critical. Cultural intelligence, when used, can help to move people from the margins of work\nto the center, thus engaging them and creating systems of inclusion rather than representation.\nI found reframing to be beneficial to leaders when developing long-lasting and meaningful\nintercultural relationships. For this to happen, it is vital for leaders and organizations to change their\nthinking about and practices concerning relationships. Leaders can create a shift in cultivating\nauthentic relationships with different cultural groups or individuals when the questions asked are\nshifted from \u201chow can this relationship help me to reach my organizational (personal) goals\u201d to\n\u201cwhat can I (we) learn from this relationship, and how can the learning move us toward our vision?\u201d\nI suggested this question to a woman who manages volunteers in a nonprofit. In our brief\nconversation, she realized that asking the question in this way helped her to see culture and diversity\nas a process rather than an outcome. She realized that it was important to build relationships for\ndiversity work, but in doing so the relationships built can have a larger impact than the diversity\nefforts themselves. By asking questions such as \u201cwhat forms of relationships need to exist in this\norganization,\u201d \u201cwhat do relationships mean to this organization,\u201d and \u201chow do people in this\norganization work together\u201d enables the organization to become a learning organization based\naround diversity and culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n189 Asking these questions enables people to be more authentic and understanding of how relationships\nare created. This is a critical element in cultural intelligence work as it helps leaders to tap into the\npower that relationships have in building trust and unity. When we engage in this type of work, we\nreframe how we think about culture as it relates to power, decision making, authority, and\nleadership. We reframe who our values speak to and who they exclude, and we gain clarity about\nwhere our responsibility within our societies exists.\n[1] Bolman and Deal (2008).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n190 8.2 Adaptive Work\nIt is clear that the practice of cultural intelligence forces leaders to be more adaptive to their\nsurroundings. Adaptive work requires a change in values, beliefs, or behavior. [1] Furthermore, it\nrequires leaders to lead through conflicting values held by different groups and to eliminate the gap\nbetween the values people have and the realities of their lives. Ronalid Heifetz wrote, \u201cAdapting to\nhuman challenges requires that we go beyond the requirements of simply surviving. We perceive\nproblems whenever circumstances do not conform to the way we think things ought to be. Thus,\nadaptive work involves not only the assessment of reality but also the clarification of values.\u201d [2]\nLeaders are defined by their values, their beliefs, and their character. To be culturally intelligent\nmeans that you must constantly review, revise, and reflect upon your personal value systems and\nhow these systems impact your cultural interactions. Leaders must understand and articulate what\nvalues drive their behaviors and attitudes. This means that leaders must question and challenge, that\nthey explore the deeper stories that give life to their belief systems, and that they are courageous\nenough to give themselves a \u201creality check\u201d for any dissonance surfacing between their beliefs and\nactions.\nToo often, I see organizations develop assessments and tools to measure the effectiveness of \u201cthe\norganization as a system,\u201d and forget about the most important system, the \u201cpersonal value system\u201d\nthat drives most of organizational processes and thinking. By doing this, organizational leaders\nexpect the organization to adapt but do not have the support of its workers. We need to be reminded\nthat organizational systems come about because there are people within the organization who are\ndriven by their personal values and beliefs. Organizations can adapt if the people within them are\ngiven the opportunity and resources to adapt.\n[1] Heifetz (1994), p. 22.\n[2] Heifetz (1994), p. 31.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n191 8.3 Interdependency\nMartin Luther King, Jr., said that \u201cWhatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\u201d Relationships\nand interdependence are at the core of our survival. Peter Senge wrote that leaders of the future must\nhave the skill set to \u201csee patterns of interdependency.\u201d [1] We live in an interdependent world; our\nactions and choices know no boundaries. Senge suggests that we must see the connections and\nrelationships between, among, and within systems\u2014cultural, political, legal, social, economic,\nfamilial, and so on. We need to be able to live effectively with one another, and if we can \u201csee\nsystemic patterns and understand the forces driving a system,\u201d we can \u201cstart to see where the system\nis headed if nothing changes.\u201d [2]\nTo begin to see interdependence, culturally intelligent leaders need to be clear about their purpose in\nworking with cultural groups, people, and processes. Purpose, in culturally intelligent leadership, is\nto understand oneself in relationship to what is being sought. In other words, understanding and\nexploring your motivations, your passion, and your personal journey must serve as a foundation for\nreaching the desired vision to create cultural understanding and awareness. You must personally\nexplore and identify what it would mean to the organization, and most importantly to its people, if\ndiversity and culture of thoughts, ideas, people, systems did not exist.\nSimply asking yourself and others, \u201cif we did not do this work, what would be lost,\u201d can help people\nto understand the systemic nature of culture. I once worked with a manager who asked this question\nof himself, and then his staff. The result was a deep and authentic dialogue about the responsibility\nthat each person brings to the process. They understood that culture and diversity was not something\nto control or \u201cmanage,\u201d rather it was a human element that needed to be nurtured and cared for by\neveryone. The intercultural work to be explored involved everyone no matter what level of cultural\nconsciousness they came into the organization with. In the end, people in the organization gained an\nunderstanding for the different notions of diversity, a more clear purpose and passion for\nintercultural interactions, and enthusiastic support for creating a culturally inclusive environment.\n[1] Senge (1990), p. 39.\n[2] Senge (1990), p. 39.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n192 8.4 Consciousness\nAs we progress in our understanding of culture we learn through our cognition what it takes to be a\nleader in an intercultural world. What is required, as evident in the idea of cultural intelligence, is a\nmore holistic, paradoxical picture of leadership. The picture is one that must engage people\u2019s whole\nself, including the emotional, physical, mental, social, and spiritual domains.\nThis picture of leadership also forces us to recognize that the opposites we see, for example\nindividualism and collectivism, are not in conflict; rather, they complement each other, enabling us\nto look at our individual and group strengths and our weaknesses in its totality. Opposites are not to\ndemonstrate a \u201cbetter than the other\u201d dichotomy; instead, opposites create harmony, helping us to\ndiscover where we have been out of balance. Culturally intelligent leaders know they must balance\nthe paradoxes of life: judge and learn, individual and group, strength and weakness, old and new,\nmindfulness and mindlessness, possible and impossible, and so on.\nWe are, as Carl Rogers noted, in a time where consciousness is critical to our self-development and,\nthus, the development of others. Through consciousness-raising activities such as cultural\nintelligence, we have the opportunity to let go of our limiting thoughts and behaviors. This\nconsciousness creation is what Mary Parker Follet noted as both the social and political force of the\nfuture. It is through this creation, a collective conscious, that creative forces will emerge and work\nthrough the chaos and complexity of our times.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n193 8.5 A Return to the Cultural Labyrinth\nJoseph Campbell [1] said that by going down into the abyss, we remember the treasures of life. In\ncultural intelligence, leaders must be able to raise their levels of collective cultural consciousness by\nseeking out the challenges, or our \u201cabyss\u201d. It is often difficult to disclose one\u2019s weaknesses, one\u2019s\nfears, and one\u2019s vulnerabilities concerning cultural diversity: The abyss is not really a comfortable\nplace to be, but it does serve as an opportunity to explore one\u2019s self-concept. Cultural intelligence\nprovides leaders with a chance to expand their capacities to become better cross-cultural leaders.\nIn the end, when you reach your destination, you will be changed. In our cultural intelligence\njourney, we all return to our core, our home, our center. We come back not as the same person,\nbecause the world we left that was familiar to us is now unfamiliar. Campbell said that when we\nreturn to our true selves\u2014our authentic selves\u2014we need to be willing to rid ourselves of the life we\nhave planned in order to enjoy the life that waits. Once you begin the work of cultural intelligence,\nyou can no longer be the same person; you cannot go back to who you were and pick up the pieces as\nyou left them. Your leadership story is different, and how you engage with people of different cultural\nbackgrounds will be different.\nIf you truly do work that is culturally intelligent, work that is meaningful and intentional, then you\nwill come to realize that differences in cultures promote a diversity of thinking, innovative practices,\nand ideas that take you out of mindlessness. Cultural intelligence keeps you alert and attentive to\nchallenges in order to help you reach your highest potential. In business, culture\u2019s impact is to\nconstantly test an organization\u2019s ability to be adaptable and flexible\u2014to be the best by letting go of\nold assumptions and biases. It has always been the role of culture to help us let go of what we think\nwe know and open our eyes to the responsibility we all have, as leaders, in shaping a better society.\n[1] Campbell (1988).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n194 Chapter 9\nReferences\nAdams, M.
