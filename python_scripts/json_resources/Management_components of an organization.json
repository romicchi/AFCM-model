This control enables\norganization members to make decisions quickly when necessary.\nKey Terms\norganizational psychologist: A person who conducts scientific study of employees and workplaces.\nCommon Elements of Organizations\nOrganizational psychologist Edgar Schein proposes four common elements of an organization's structure:\nCommon purpose\nCoordinated effort\nDivision of labor\nHierarchy of authority\nFrom a manager's point of view, operations are made successful by instilling a common purpose to create a coordinated effort across the\norganization and organizing resources based on tasks and decision making. Each of the four elements is relatively straightforward in\ntheory but represents a critical component of an effective structure.\nVideo of Edgar Schein speaking about corporate culture\nCommon Purpose\nAn organization without a clear purpose or mission soon begins to drift and become disorganized. A common purpose unifies employees\nor members and gives everyone an understanding of the organization's direction. Ensuring that the common purpose is effectively\ncommunicated across organizations (particularly large organizations with many moving parts) is a central task for managers. Managers\ncommunicate this purpose by educating all employees on the general strategy, mission statement, values, and short- and long-term\nobjectives of the organization.\nCoordinated Effort\nCoordinating effort involves working together in a way that maximizes resources. The common purpose is achieved through the\ncoordinated effort of all individuals and groups within an organization. The broader group's diverse skill sets and personalities must be\nleveraged in a way that adds value. The act of coordinating organizational effort is perhaps the most important responsibility of managers\nbecause it motivates and distributes human resources to capture value.\nDivision of Labor\nDivision of labor is also known as work specification for greater efficiency. It involves delegating specific parts of a broader task to\ndifferent people within the organization based upon their particular abilities and skills. Using division of labor, an organization can parcel\nout a complex work effort for specialists to perform. By systematically dividing complex tasks into specialized jobs, an organization uses\nits human resources more efficiently.\nHierarchy of Authority\nHierarchy of authority is essentially the chain of command\u2014a control mechanism for making sure the right people do the right things at\nthe right time. While there are a wide variety of organizational structures\u2014some with more centralization of authority than others\u2014\nhierarchy in decision making is a critical factor for success. Knowing who will make decisions under what circumstances enables\norganizations to be agile, while ambiguity of authority can often slow the decision-making process. Authority enables organizations to set\ndirections and select strategies, which can in turn enable a common purpose.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
