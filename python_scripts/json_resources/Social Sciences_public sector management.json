This book follows an earlier publication Introduction to Public Sector\nManagement, which I published in my home country, Mauritius, in 2005. Compared with\nthe earlier publication, this book offers a new approach to public administration based\non developments occurring in this millennium\u2019s first decade and which are likely to shape\nforthcoming years.\nThis book is written in a simple manner by discussing each key issue likely to influence\npublic sector management. Issues range from an outlook of the public sector, the general\nmanagement functions in the public service, to problems on change along with relevant\nhuman resource management topics like recruitment, welfare, training, and development.\nTo better discuss current issues in public sector management, new themes like public\nsector governance and e-government have been included to provide students more learning\nopportunities while keeping readers abreast of on-going developments in this area. The final\nchapters focus on politics and the public sector\u2019s future with scholarly points of view of\ncontemporary thinkers in the ever-evolving field of public sector management.\nThis book\u2019s content is based on material available online from trusted sources, reference\nbooks, and journals that provide insight into contemporary public sector management. The\napproach is global in there is no specific environment where this publication is based since\nexamples for illustration are taken from diverse sources that cover emerging and developed\neconomies. Contributions from various authorities like the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) an the Australian Victoria government, along with\nleading papers like Harvard Business Review or Forbes, enabled me to be more aware of\npotential developments that now affect the public sector. As an author, I was pleased to see\nhow public administration varies from country to country while it retains the fundamental\nprinciples of planning, quality, and integrity in the same way worldwide.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n6 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PrefaCe\nThis book contains 14 chapters on key public sector management issues, around 15 case\nstudies and insights, a bank of 140 short questions to test understanding, 80 multiple-choice\nquestions with answers covering the whole book, and 50 structured essay-type questions.\nPublic Sector Management: A Millennial Insight is a companion for public administration\nundergraduates studying first general modules. This book may also suit Management\nGraduates and Post-Graduates who wish to explore this area. The text is fully referenced\nto stimulate further reading.\nNIRMAL KUMAR BETCHOO\nJULY 2016\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n7 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT note from reviewer\nNOTE FROM REVIEWER\nI am very privileged to read and review this helpful book Public Sector Management:\nA Millennium Insight before publishing. My changes follow advice from eminent scholars\nlike George Orwell, William Strunk, and Elwyn Brooks White. Where possible, sentences\nhave been made active, positive, and shorter. Words are shorter and plainer by letters or\nsyllables to increase clarity of expression. Simple verbs have taken place of phrases, and\nvivid verbs in lieu of adverbs.\nThis is my first experience as a reviewer but I personally humbly admit that this project,\nseen from a different eye, contributes better to understanding Public Sector Management\ntoday. It was my pleasure to collaborate with author Dr. Nirmal Betchoo for this publication\nthat will surely be of use to students.\nCYRUS JONES, GRADUATE, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, USA\nJULY 2016\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n8 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\n1 I NTRODUCING PUBLIC\nSECTOR MANAGEMENT\nAims\nIntroduce the concept of public sector management.\nUnderstand the nature of public sector management.\nLearn about the need to reform the public sector.\nDiscuss the public sector\u2019s importance.\nHighlight the services provided by the public sector.\nDiscuss the challenges of the public sector.\nIdentify the typical role and activities of a public officer.\nDebate the concept of the public service.\nIntroduction\nPublic Sector Management concerns governance in each contemporary country. The\nState is possibly among the largest or the single most important employer in almost all\ncountries. Public service personnel comprise of people employed by public authorities at\ncentral, regional, and local levels and include civil servants and public employees. Public\nauthorities are expected to provide high-quality services to their citizens and decent work\nfor their workers.1\nThe public sector covers upstream core ministries and central agencies, downstream bodies\ninclude both sector ministries, and non-executive state institutions. Upstream bodies involve\ncore ministries and agencies at the government\u2019s centre, such as the Ministry of Finance and\noffices that support the head of government, which have functions that cut across sectors.2\nDownstream bodies include both sector ministries and agencies, as well as education and\nhealth providers which deliver and fund services under the State\u2019s policy direction. They\nalso include a diverse group of more autonomous bodies such as regulators and state-owned\nenterprises and corporate bodies which, in many countries, still provide the majority of\ninfrastructure services despite extensive privatisation. Non-executive state institutions include\njudiciaries, legislatures and institutions such as supreme audit institutions.3\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n9 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nPublic Sector Management is an important part of public service as it is accepted capable\nmanagers will drive change in the sector. Too often, the public sector has been considered\nas a weak partner of any economy because it is associated with dull jobs, lack of prospect,\nbureaucracy, bottlenecks, and red tape.\nAn African outlook of the public sector\nWith most African countries attaining independence in the late 1950s and 1960s, the\npublic sector is seen as the pivot that will promote socio-economic development. The basic\nfunction of the public sector, which comprises institutions for making decisions regarding\ninterests of various kinds, was to provide goods and services to citizens based on \u2018realisation\nand representation of public interests and its possession of unique public qualities compared\nto business management\u2019.4\nAn argument for reforming public service\nSince the 1980s, developed and developing countries have been embarking on public- sector\nmanagement reforms. The role and institutional character of the State has been questioned,\nand the public sector has been under pressure to adopt private sector orientations. The earlier\nreforms aimed at shaping a public administration that could lead national development\nand was based on the same institutional peculiarities inherited from colonial times. More\nrecently, the World Bank and other donors in Africa have been concerned with finding other\nways of organising and managing public services and redefining the role of the State to give\nmore prominence to markets and competition, and to the private and voluntary sectors.\nThe alternative vision, based on issues of efficiency, representation, participation, and\naccountability has sought to create a market-friendly, liberalised, lean, decentralised, customer-\noriented, managerial, and democratic State. The public service \u2013 ministries, parastatals, and\nextra-ministerial departments \u2013 has always been the tool available to African governments\nfor the implementation of developmental goals. It is seen as a pivot African economies\u2019\ngrowth. It manages an appropriate and conducive environment in which all sectors of\nthe economy can perform optimally, and it is this catalytic role of the public service that\npropelled governments all over the world to search continuously for better ways to deliver\ntheir services.5\nThis sector remains, however, the economy\u2019s productive component even if such productivity\nremains unseen. Compared with the private sector, the public sector is a provider of services,\nnot the profit-making counterpart. The role of the State is changing and the Civil Service or\npublic sector is increasingly being called upon to be a proactive \u201cfacilitator\u201d and an \u201cagent\nof social change.\u201d6\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n10 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nThe Civil Service\u2019s key functions in this competitive environment can be summarised\nas follows:\n- developing creative, strategic policies;\n- designing and delivering services directly or in partnership which meet the\npublic\u2019s needs;\n- using public money efficiently, while upholding core values of integrity, impartiality,\nhonesty, and objectivity.\nThe Civil service\u2019s challenge increased over the years. As developing economies progressed\nfrom a subsistence one to a service-oriented one, the importance of the civil service has\nsubstantially increased. The scope is no more limited to the internal economy because of\nexternal challenges. It has been felt the civil service must contribute to the globalisation\nconcept where it must shed off its limited domestic inclination to a more open, flexible,\npro-active philosophy evidenced in a dynamic sector.\nTo this end, the public sector should be on the move. No more room for complacency and\ninertia, no more need to speak of inefficiency and sluggishness. The public sector should\npartner the economy and collaborate with the private sector and foreign institutions. It\nshould offer value for money services while aiming to serve excellently due to greater\nexigency from communities and stakeholders. Though it is hard to shed off certain clich\u00e9s,\nthe public sector must keep pace with changes and development.\nIn the next paragraph, a Case Study explains the need for a modernised public service\nthat performs better to citizens and develops capabilities of offering better and tailor-made\npublic service to society.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n11 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nCase Study: The need to maximise the performance and potential of all employees\nand organisations7\nWe work in a dynamic workplace with roles and opportunities spanning policy, diplomacy,\noperational management, programme management, process improvement, and service\ndelivery across national issues as diverse as driving economic growth, responding to climate\nchange, and tackling obesity. We recruit on strict principles of merit and probity, and have\ntraditionally attracted a skilled and professional workforce. The Civil Service\u2019s effectiveness\ndepends on the performance of its leaders, managers, and staff ultimately. Yet, the feedback\npoints to we are not making the best use of our talent and expertise. We must take quick\naction to prepare for the demographic challenges of an ageing workforce. To achieve the\nvision for the future, we need to recruit regularly, become an employer of choice, and set\nthe highest value on staff\u2019s quality and performance at all levels, in all roles. To support this,\nwe need a renewed focus on achieving greater equality of opportunity, diversity, and gender\nequality across our workforce so over time we build a Civil Service that more closely reflects\nthe society in which it works. This means significantly changing how we choose and train\nstaff and set new expectations about performance levels we will accept. To be successful\nwe will need to significantly expand our strategic human resource capability and create a\nstep-change in how we lead and manage HR practices.\nwwwwww..ssyyllvvaanniiaa..ccoomm\nWWee ddoo nnoott rreeiinnvveenntt\ntthhee wwhheeeell wwee rreeiinnvveenntt\nlliigghhtt..\nFFaasscciinnaattiinngg lliigghhttiinngg ooffffeerrss aann iinnfifinniittee ssppeeccttrruumm ooff\nppoossssiibbiilliittiieess:: IInnnnoovvaattiivvee tteecchhnnoollooggiieess aanndd nneeww\nmmaarrkkeettss pprroovviiddee bbootthh ooppppoorrttuunniittiieess aanndd cchhaalllleennggeess..\nAAnn eennvviirroonnmmeenntt iinn wwhhiicchh yyoouurr eexxppeerrttiissee iiss iinn hhiigghh\nddeemmaanndd..

What are the key concerns of a contemporary and accountable public service?\n2. What are the main considerations in developing the future of the public service?\n3. How can the public sector benefit from an expansion of its human resource capability?\nThe need for a contemporary public sector\nModernisation and efficient performance of public administration are essential to making\nchanges that will substantially improve effective functioning of the state in all its dimensions.8\nThe State\u2019s general goals in managing public administration is to improve the quality of\npublic administration entities and public services to boost a country\u2019s social and economic\ndevelopment and improve the quality of life of its citizens. The pillars on which this aim will\nbe built include economisation, information, and personal development across all structures\nand at all levels of public administration. The citizens and satisfaction of their needs must\nbe at the centre of attention in organising how public administration works. At the same\ntime, the public administration system needs to be made more transparent for citizens,\nenabling them to adequately and reasonably take part in decision-making and control. It is\nimportant they be able to have a majority of their needs accommodated at a single contact\npoint, in keeping with the principle \u201cinformation should move around, not the citizen\u201d.9\nA glimpse of services provided\nIt would be difficult to comment lengthily on the range of services the public sector\nprovides. Civil service activities span throughout the country. In villages, towns, and cities\nthe imprint of the public sector is inevitable. From primary schools to health centres, from\nCitizen Advice Bureaus to police stations, the government spans its activities broadly in\nall countries. The bland perception is the public service is centred in the capital city and\nservices are offered from Head Offices. This perception is unavoidable but does not clearly\nillustrate how the civil service influences communities pervasively.\nEasily Accessible, essential public services are:\n- Health services by the Ministry of Health and Quality of Life.\n- Police service and surveillance by the Police Force.\n- Education provided to primary, secondary and tertiary institutions by the Ministry\nof Education.\n- Postal services provided by the Ministry of Information Technology and\nTelecommunications.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n13 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nOther services that are apparently less noticeable but are still highly regarded are:\n- Documentation in the different ministries.\n- Preparation of financial statements and accounts.\n- Counselling and advice.\n- Processing of documents.\n- Feedback and replies to different parties concerned.\n- Processing information and inputting them as data in the Central Statistics Bureau.\n- Processing of forms linked with government finance, Income Tax.\nDefining a Public Officer\u2019s role\nA Public Officer, in his capacity as a government employee, can be described as follows:10\nThe public officer is a government employee\nThe public officer works for the government. Different clerical officers administrative and\npermanent secretaries in different ministries do all supervisory or executive tasks. Basically,\na public officer attaches to a Ministry.\nThe public officer serves in the different departments of the government\nThe public officer works in different ministries \u2013 for example, the Ministry of Education\nand Scientific Research, the Ministry of Tourism, and the Ministry of Co-operatives. The\nincumbent is subject to mobility across or within the departments where he/she is entitled\nto work based on competences and qualifications.\nThe public officer works for the government and is entitled to such a duty for\n24 hours\nAccording to public service regulations, any public officer should firstly comply herself\nwith his allocated job. In any circumstance, the Ministry needs his service, the civil servant\nshould be ready to carry out the assigned duty.\nThe public officer normally holds a permanent, pensionable job\nAll public officers\u2019 jobs are permanent because once they join a ministry, they work on a\nprobationary period for one year or two before becoming a fully-fledged employee. The job\nis then \u2018permanent\u2019 as it lasts until retirement.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n14 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nThe public officer is entitled to pensions and retirement benefits by the State\nPension schemes are generally well structured and planned for public officers. This earlier\ncontrasted with the private sector as a major attraction for public jobs. The pension scheme\nis also spread to parapublic bodies.\nThe public sector\u2019s attractiveness\nThe issue appears debatable, but more people are willing to join the public sector. In times\nof economic difficulty, it is clear more people are joining the sector. Jobs may have up to\n10,000 applicants even if the salary they command are lower, if not, meagre at times compared\nwith those offered in the private sector. Yet, there are several reasons that attract many young 333666000\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\npeople to join the public sector. The \u2018Insight\u2019 in this chapter offers an illustration of why\nthe younger generation known as Millennials could want public service jobs. ...\nttthhhiiinnnkkkiiinnnggg\n333666000\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\n...\nttthhhiiinnnkkkiiinnnggg\n333666000\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\n...\nttthhhiiinnnkkkiiinnnggg\n333666000\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\n...\nttthhhiiinnnkkkiiinnnggg\nDDDiiissscccooovvveeerrr ttthhheee tttrrruuuttthhh aaattt wwwwwwwww...dddeeellloooiiitttttteee...cccaaa///cccaaarrreeeeeerrrsss DDDiiissscccooovvveeerrr ttthhheee tttrrruuuttthhh aaattt wwwwwwwww...dddeeellloooiiitttttteee...cccaaa///cccaaarrreeeeeerrrsss\n\u00a9\u00a9\u00a9 DDDeeellloooiiitttttteee &&& TTTooouuuccchhheee LLLLLLPPP aaannnddd aaaffffififillliiiaaattteeeddd eeennntttiiitttiiieeesss...\nDDDiiissscccooovvveeerrr ttthhheee tttrrruuuttthhh aaattt wwwwwwwww...dddeeellloooiiitttttteee...cccaaa///cccaaarrreeeeeerrrsss \u00a9\u00a9\u00a9 DDDeeellloooiiitttttteee &&& TTTooouuuccchhheee LLLLLLPPP aaannnddd aaaffffififillliiiaaattteeeddd eeennntttiiitttiiieeesss...\n\u00a9\u00a9\u00a9 DDDeeellloooiiitttttteee &&& TTTooouuuccchhheee LLLLLLPPP aaannnddd aaaffffififillliiiaaattteeeddd eeennntttiiitttiiieeesss...\nDDDDowiiinsssccclooooavvvdeee rrrfr etttehhh eeee Btttrrrouuuokttthhhs aaaatttt b wwwoowwwkbwwwo...odddneee.lllcooooiiimtttttteee...cccaaa///cccaaarrreeeeeerrrsss\n1155\n\u00a9\u00a9\u00a9 DDDeeellloooiiitttttteee &&& TTTooouuuccchhheee LLLLLLPPP aaannnddd aaaffffififillliiiaaattteeeddd eeennntttiiitttiiieeesss... PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nInsight: Millennials are attracted to public service, but government needs to deliver\nResults show government agencies are employers of choice for many young people. Perhaps\nfederal agencies appear to offer the job characteristics that most appeal to the millennial\ngeneration: secure employment, work-life balance, and a chance to make a difference. Many\nmillennials have experienced or seen first-hand the private sector\u2019s employment instabilities \u2013\ncaused by factors such as mergers, downsizing, layoffs, or companies going bankrupt \u2013 and\nhave decided their futures are more promising if they are not tied to the volatility of the\nprivate sector job market.11\nThe research also asked students to identify the most important \u2018attractors\u2019 an employer\ncould offer.12\nThe responses provided by at least 40 percent of students are:\n1. Respect for its people \u2013 53.7 percent\n2. Secure employment \u2013 52.5 percent\n3. Creative and dynamic work environment \u2013 49.1 percent\n4. Professional training & development \u2013 45.7 percent\n5. Friendly work environment \u2013 45.6 percent\n6. Leaders who will support my development \u2013 42.7 percent\n7. High future earnings \u2013 42 percent\n8. Leadership opportunities \u2013 40.9 percent\nPublic Officers\u2019 General Working Conditions\nThis section broadly speaks of the general employment conditions that public officers are entitled\nto in the common workplace settings. They could be basically similar in most countries.13\nPermanent, pensionable jobs\nJobs are permanent and pensionable. People like to feel secure when they are doing a job\neven if the salary offered to them is fairly low. Many people, after time spent in a private\ncompany, may choose such a sector because of job security.\nRegulated work hours\nGenerally speaking, hours of work are regulated. The 9 to 4 or 5 \u2013 working from 09 00h\nto 17 00h \u2013 concept is favoured throughout the sector but this does not relate to essential\nservices like police, fire, and health services in particular.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n16 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nRelatively service-based, less cumbersome jobs\nIt is apparent that paperwork or related work looks less cumbersome than somebody doing a\ndifficult task. Anyway, the general perception is that jobs are less demanding in government\nthan in the private sector.\nStatus and recognition\nEmployees in the public service can claim themselves \u2018white-collar\u2019 officers. For most of the\njobs done, employees work in offices. They are recognised and respected as public servants.\nDecent salaries\nGovernment are decent as every job bears a salary structure including the entry point,\nthe top salary along with increments and other progress through the job. Such a structure\navoids exploiting employees.\nCentral location jobs\nMost jobs are done in the capital city and strategic locations of a country. People may feel\nvalued to work in important offices in the city\u2019s administrative centre. Activities are also\ndecentralised, however, depending on the nature of jobs.\nChallenges to the public sector\nDespite attraction provided by public service jobs, there remains certain disadvantages in\nthe public service that deters young people to be attracted to government jobs. An OECD\nReport on public sector management highlights a few valid reasons supporting the lack of\ninterest of people in joining public jobs.14\nLower wages compared to the private sector\nWhen competing for new staff, especially young graduates, salaries are important. In some\ncountries, this problem only concerns specialised staff (such as IT personnel). Wages prove\nbe a crucial factor in retaining staff, especially after two to four years of service. The salary\nlevel is not the only critical issue. There is also the possibility of influencing one\u2019s own\nsalary by performance. Pay systems are being developed which include elements based on\nindividual/team performance or results. Surveys show that performance-based salary systems\nare attractive to young people.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n17 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nThe image of the public sector is neither positive, clear, nor stimulating\nAlthough there are exceptions among Member countries, young people do not rate public\nemployment very highly. The public sector is deemed dull, bureaucratic, old fashioned, and\nthe prestige of civil service low. In addition, citizens\u2019 trust in the State decreased, negatively\ninfluencing government\u2019s image.\nSlow advancement including how seniority is more important than merit\nA common belief is it is impossible to advance by promotion, and there is a fixed order,\nindependent of performance. There is a weak tradition of recognising individual merits\nof employees.\nPublic sector is not reaching students and graduates in the way most commercial\ncompanies do\nThis applies to marketing vacancy posts, use of electronic recruitment as well as, for example,\nincreasing knowledge on public organisations. Methods used to attract students are often\nmore passive than active.\nWWWWeeee wwwwiiiillllllll ttttuuuurrrrnnnn yyyyoooouuuurrrr CCCCVVVV iiiinnnnttttoooo\naaaannnn ooooppppppppoooorrrrttttuuuunnnniiiittttyyyy ooooffff aaaa lllliiiiffffeeeettttiiiimmmmeeee\nDDDDoooo yyyyoooouuuu lllliiiikkkkeeee ccccaaaarrrrssss????

This applies to job content, opportunities for development, career opportunities,\nwork scheduling and salaries. A challenge for government organisations is to create workplaces\nthat meet the preferences of both the organisation and the employees.\nCareer paths are unclear, career planning insufficient\nTo make career path opportunities clearer, we need strategic actions at several stages.\nRecruitment situations give employers the opportunity to explain career prospects. Questions\ninclude how to incorporate career planning in regular performance and career discussions\nand how to create pay and other HRM systems that promote both kind of careers: one\nleading to leadership positions and one leading to expert positions. Increasing mobility is\nclosely related to this issue.\nStaff development will be an increasingly important competitive factor\nThe public sector is challenged to use knowledge management to ensure everyday development\nis kept competitive and public organisations are at the edge of knowledge creation.\nA perception of public service\nBased from the French system of public administration, the following arguments support the\nrationale for what the public is in essence. This comprises certain elements of jurisdiction\nthat help anybody understand the essence of public services and how they are inclusive both\nfor public and privately undertaken activities on behalf of the public service. The texts have\nbeen translated from the original French language.\nSeveral functions exist in a well-established legal system.15\nAccording to set goals, the public service performs four main functions.\nFirst, public services are distinguished for purposes of order and regulation (national defence,\njustice, civil protection, professional bodies), those aimed at the health and social protection\n(social security, public hospital), those for educational and cultural purposes (education,\nresearch, public service broadcasting) and those of an economic nature.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n19 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nThe legal aspect of the public service is organised around three major principles. The first\nis that of continuity of public service. There is one aspect of the continuity of the state\nand has been called a principle constitutional by the Constitutional Council (1979). It is\nbased on the need to meet the needs of general interest without interruption. Depending\non services, however, the concept of continuity does not have the same content (total times\nfor hospital emergencies, scheduled hours for others).\nThe jurisprudence of the State Council is very specific on this requirement: The principle\nof continuity should accommodate the constitutional principle which is the right to strike.\nMost public employees have this right, except for some categories for which strikes are\nprohibited (police, military) or limited by a minimum service (aviation, railways, radio,\nand television).\nThe second principle is of equality in the public service, another constitutional principle in\nline with the general principle of equality of all before the law, proclaimed by the Declaration\nof Human Rights and the citizen of 1789. It means each person has equal right to access\nthe service, take part equally in financial charges resulting from services (tariff equal except\nfor optional services such as music schools), and must be treated in the same way as any\nother user of the service. Therefore, the defect of neutrality \u2013 the principle which is an\nextension of the principle of equality \u2013 of a public servant, such as racism against a user,\nbreaches ethics.\nThe last principle of the public service is that of adaptability or mutability. Presented as\na corollary of the principle of continuity, it is more focused to providing the best service\nqualitatively rather than its continuity over time. This means that the public service must\nnot remain static in face of changes in society; it must follow the needs of users (like\norganisational flexibility utilities) and technical evolutions (for instance during transition\nin the early twentieth century, electricity, gas).\nConceptual view of public service jobs\nThe public service can be defined in an organic or technical way.16\nIn an organic way, the public service is an organisation formed by agents and material\nresources intended to perform certain provisions within an administration like health like\nhealth services.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n20 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nIn a technical sense, the public service is a general-purpose organisation; while utilities are\npursuing a goal of profitability, they must primarily be designed to perform a \u2018public service\nmission\u2019. The first goal is to satisfy public interest. The public service is justified only by this\ngoal difficult to determine as variable in time and space (as recalled by the Constitutional\nCouncil in its decision of 26 June 1986).\nThe workplace legislation considers as belonging to this category, agencies that meet certain\ncharacteristics:\nThey must first meet the public interest, and therefore not to use profitability requirements or\nseek profit (unlike businesses). They must be attached to a public officer. An administration\nshould control the activity of general interest traditionally.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n2211 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nNature of public service today\nPublic service jobs are all attached to the State. Parastatal organisations could be also part\nof public jobs as they follow similar work conditions offered by a public job. While the\npublic job is entirely non-profit oriented, the parastatal job could be profit-oriented. For\nexample, postal services in certain nations might not fall in the same category as other\npublic activities like education or health. Postal services could be paid for by citizens and\nthe holding company might be oriented to creating profit. Also, certain commodities could\nbe provided by parastatal organisations. Water and electricity are two such essential products\nand services that could be both state-owned and privately-owned. The State regulates the\nprovision of these commodities at reasonable prices for the public while the parastatal body\ncould offer the same product at competitive prices with the intention of bringing profitability\nwhich is not, here, and the case of a full-fledged public entity.\nThe State may also encourage activities to be outsourced to private organisations with\nsome control over them. For instance, surgery which cannot be easily afforded or met in\npublic hospitals could be privately provided under government agreement. There is always\na blurring concept between the nature of public service in what it was years ago and what\nit is expected to be today with new developments cropping up in business.\nPoints\nThe public service personnel comprise persons employed by public authorities at central,\nregional and local levels and include both civil servants and public employees.\nModernisation and efficient performance of public administration are essential to making\nchanges that will substantially improve effective functioning of the state in all its dimensions.\nThe public officer is a government employee. He serves in the different departments of\nthe government.\nThe public officer works for the government and is entitled to such a duty for 24 hours.\nHe normally holds a permanent and pensionable job.\nThe public officer is entitled to pensions and retirement benefits by the State.\nThe general working conditions of public officers are: Permanent and pensionable jobs,\nregulated hours of work, relatively service-based and less cumbersome jobs, status and\nrecognition, decent salaries, and jobs in a central location.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n22 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT introduCing PubliC seCtor management\nQuestions\n1.

There are different types of plans\navailable and these depend on the choice government make. One can broadly learn about\nthe relevance of strategic planning since this is the key concern at the State level but other\ntypes of plans do matter.\nPlanning remains an important consideration for the public sector. Given it is characterised\nby a vast organisation and a tall structure, planning is needed to sustain the future of the\npublic service. Strategic planning may be considered more important and this should be\nundertaken at the executive level. Officials working closely with Permanent Secretaries will\nbe also involved in such an exercise.\nSome plans have been prepared in the form of documents that impact on the future of the\ndifferent ministries, occupations and even the country.\nTertiary educational reform is an example of strategic planning. White papers on Health\nincluding reforms in the sector evidence long-term planning. Master plans in various sectors\nlike agriculture, fisheries, information and communications technology, social security, among\nothers highlight the need for strategic planning in government.\nGovernment planning\u2019s purpose\nPlanning directs, reduces change\u2019s effects, minimises waste and redundancy, and sets standards\nto facilitate control.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n25 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nPlans give direction\nPublic sector executives are concerned about where their organisation is going and how\nthey can contribute to reach the aim. This means establishing robust planning and control\ncycles covering their strategic and operational plans, priorities, and targets, including risk\nmanagement processes.1 They must simultaneously engage with both internal and external\nstakeholders on how such services and other interventions can best be delivered. They will\nthen coordinate activities, cooperate with each other, and work in teams. Lack of planning\nwill create disorder and prevent the departments from attaining their goals.\nPlanning reduces uncertainty\nSince plans enable executives to think ahead, anticipate changes, and consider the impact\nof change, effective planning reduces uncertainty. Governments of sugar producing nations\nface a dilemma in relation to uncertainty in the sugar and the textile sectors. Broadly,\naction plans devised at the right moment can be wiser steps to avoid uncertainty and\ndifficulties. Risks arise because of limited information and uncertainty about the future. In\ntransportation construction projects, project managers face the risk of cost overruns, scope\nand schedule creep, and even waste, fraud, or abuse. Environmental, quality, and safety factors\nalso represent sources of risk. And with megaprojects, managers run the risk of generating\npolitical controversy at the federal, State, or local level. An unrealistic assessment of risk,\nfor example, could lead to overly optimistic estimates, resulting in unachievable goals and\nunmet expectations.2\nPlanning reduces waste\nPlanning can help reducing waste. When means and ends are clear, inefficiencies become\nvisible and overlapping or wastage is reduced. Voluntary family planning is one of the most\ncost-effective investments a country can make in its future. Every dollar spent on family\nplanning can save governments up to 6 dollars that can be spent on improving health,\nhousing, water, sanitation, and other public services.3\nPlanning establishes parameters for control\nPlanning gives standards that facilitate control. Planning and control are linked. Planning sets\ngoals and actions. Control attempts to correct the deviations from stated goals or actions.\nPlanning establishes control parameters:\nEducation: Number of State schools built, budget spent in developing infrastructure, Intake\nof students per year.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n26 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nHealth: Budget allocated and spent in the health sector, quality improvement in health\nstandards.\nTourism: Increase in the number of tourist arrivals, visitors from new markets, revenue\nand taxation receipts.\nTypes of plans: Terminology and definitions\nStrategic plans\nThese are plans that are organisation-wide. They establish overall goals and position of an\norganisation in terms of its environment. They are long term oriented and most sought after\nin public service. For instance, transforming into a cyber-island or a city-state like Singapore.\nStreib and Poister (1999) define strategic planning as something quite basic, that is, a\nplanning effort or method \u2018to focus scarce resources, to maximise effort, and to exploit\nopportunities\u2019. They state further that strategic planning: \u2026seeks to revitalise an organisation\nby channelling effort toward the most important goals and activities.4\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

PubliC seCtor Planning\nThe above-mentioned scholars surveyed local government managers about their strategic\nplanning practices and included questions on the impact of strategic planning. They found,\ndescriptively, top managers in local governments engaged in strategic planning overwhelmingly\nbelieved such planning improved performance, in terms of financial conditions, operations\nmanagement, and delivering services. The use of strategies has military roots, and we hear\nof business strategies of different kinds. Strategic planning is an essential part of aggressive\nresults-oriented management. It is a \u2018big picture\u2019 approach that appears well suited to our\nrapidly changing world.\nAims of Strategic Planning\nAim Definition\nProvide Strategic In setting direction, three purposes stand out:\nDirection\n1) strategic planning sets goals on where an organisation\nwants to go;\n2) it indicates where resources are to be concentrated; and\n3) it gives top priority and attention to strategic goals.\nGuide Priority Use of Resources are scarce or limited. Strategic planning allows for\nResources sound and pointed allocation of resources \u2013 human, financial,\nand material.\nSet Standards of Strategic planning allows an organisation to establish shared\nExcellence values and standards of excellence.\nCope with Environmental Strategic planning aims to be flexible and provide contingencies\nUncertainty and Change for uncertainty and change.\nProvide Objective Strategic planning allows for marking success and failure.\nBasis for Control and Performance measurement or tracking of strategic objectives and\nEvaluation action plans are of significance and serve as a basis for control.\nSource: Jack Koteen (1989).

It refers\nto the public policies under the competence of the institution and it offers a clear image\nof policies, commitments and measures that will be promoted at the institution level, but\nit is not a public policy document itself. A strategic plan of state institution supports the\nshift from a resources oriented management to a results based management.6\nStrategies are long-term plans. Basically, senior managers prepare them for an organisation.\nIt is a broad-based plan that requires a large amount of input from managers. Since the\nenvironment is less predictive in the long run, strategic plans mainly forecast the changes\nand make predictions.\nOperational plans\nThese refer to plans that specify details on how to reach overall goals. They are normally\ndone by operatives. Operational plans are routine and repetitive. The degree of complexity\nis lower than a strategic plan. In general, operational plans apply to a firm\u2019s operatives.\nSupervisors are empowered to put this plan to practice. For instance, monitoring daily\nattendance in the public service departments.\nThe operational plan is effective for the short-term. It is executed by operatives and quite\noften applied by the line manager or supervisor. The operational plan is detailed but it is\nalso more easily interpreted and carried out by operatives.\nOperational plans should be prepared by the people who will be involved in implementation.\nThere is often a need for significant cross-departmental dialogue as plans created by one\npart of the organisation inevitably have implications for other parts.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n29 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nOperational plans should contain:\n- clear goals.\n- activities to be delivered.\n- quality standards.\n- desired outcomes.\n- staffing and resource requirements.\n- implementation timetables.\n- a process for monitoring progress.\nShort-term plans\nThese are similar to operational plans that cover a period of less than one year. Such plans\nare predictive in that they are quite easy and straightforward to plan for the short term. Note\nthat short and operational plans are broadly similar in perspective. For instance, improving\nservice to patients through effective time management.\n9999999933333333%%%%%%%%\nOOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF MMMMMMMMIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMM SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTSSSSSSSS AAAAAAAARRRRRRRREEEEEEEE\nWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRKKKKKKKKIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRR SSSSSSSSEEEEEEEECCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR 33333333 MMMMMMMMOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSS\nFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOONNNNNNNN\nMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTT\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYY IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE CCCCCCCCEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDD AAAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDDD TTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEE AAAAAAAADDDDDDDDVVVVVVVVAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE UUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIQQQQQQQQUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS\nLLLLLLLLeeeeeeeennnnnnnnggggggggtttttttthhhhhhhh:::::::: 11111111OOOOOOOO MMMMMMMMOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSS\nTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE CCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF SSSSSSSSPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIINNNNNNNN OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRSSSSSSSS\nAAAAAAAAvvvvvvvv........

For instance, a Master\nPlan on Education or on Health is a long term plan that can impact on education for at\nleast five years. These are less predictive than the short term plan. Long-term plans lay the\nstrategy for the organisation and they have a large focus.\nSpecific plans\nSpecific plans have clearly defined aims. They leave no room for interpretation. They require\nclarity and a sense of predictability. When uncertainty is high, managers may not use such\nplans. They can choose directional plans.\nDirectional plans\nDirectional plans identify general guidelines. They provide focus but are not specific and\nexact. They are more flexible than specific plans. For example, reforming education to\nimprove overall educational standards.\nObjectives\nObjectives are specific goals. The terms are used interchangeably. They state end results.\nOverall objectives must be supported by sub-objectives. Objectives form a hierarchy as\nwell as a network. Further, corporate management and officers have multiple goals which\nare sometimes incompatible and may lead to conflicts within the organisation. Objectives\nrepresent the desired outcomes for people, groups or entire organisations.\nCase Study: Mc Kinsey\u2019s strategic planning for governments worldwide7\nThe Mc Kinsey group helps public institutions build and execute strategies to achieve their\npolicy and organisational goals. Public-sector organisations around the world face important\nquestions about how to fulfil their core mission, respond to political and environmental\nchanges, and deliver services to citizens despite reduced budgets. To answer these questions,\norganisations must undertake rigorous strategic planning \u2013 a process that can be difficult,\nespecially in the context of a diverse stakeholder environment with numerous and often\ndivergent interests and priorities.\nWorking in collaboration with senior leaders, the Mc Kinsey group helps public-sector\norganisations set a vision for strategic outcomes, build a robust fact base, rigorously assess\noptions under uncertainty, design an actionable plan, win support from key stakeholders, and\nevaluate progress from design through execution to ensure that strategies have lasting impact.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n31 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nDrawing on insights from the private sector and decades of public-sector work, the Mc Kinsey\ngroup supports clients on a range of strategic topics, including identifying social, economic,\nand technology trends; synchronising budgeting and strategic-planning processes; designing\nstakeholder-engagement plans; and creating innovation programs at scale. The consultants\nadvise public-sector agencies varying in size, scope, and geography \u2013 from regional health\nagencies in Africa to school districts in US cities, from national defence departments to\nmunicipal infrastructure and technology teams.\nIn the past five years alone, the Mc Kinsey group has supported more than 1,000 public-\nsector strategy projects. Examples include the following:\n- advising a national government in Asia on a competitive tourism strategy that has\nled to revenue growth and significant job creation\n- helping a government agency bring together three sub agencies that had historically\ndeveloped their own strategic plans, creating an integrated approach with broad\nstaff support\n- supporting a US government agency in overhauling its approach to strategic priority\nsetting; specific tasks included helping the client build alignment and develop a\nshared prioritisation process used by all ministers and senior officials\n- assisting a major African government\u2019s tax division in transforming its process\nfor handling budget planning and revenue allocation in the face of significant\ndemographic and economic changes, resulting in improved collection rates\n- supporting an Asian municipality in creating a strategic road map to grow into a\nmajor metropolis, attracting significant private investment, developing a \u2018go live\u2019\nplan for a new automotive zone, and implementing new urban-planning incentives\nto ensure sustainable growth.\nMc Kinsey\u2019s global team of consultants has access to proprietary research, tools, and solutions\nthat have been successfully tested and applied in various contexts. For example, the McKinsey\nCentre for Government\u2019s research on strategies for government innovation offers insights\non how successes achieved in one department can be appropriately scaled across a national\ngovernment. The consultants use proven approaches, such as the portfolio of initiatives and\nsenior-team workshops, to help their clients identify solutions, accelerate innovation, and\ndrive on-the-ground change.\nSource: Mc Kinsey and Company (2016) Strategy, www.mckinsey.com\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n32 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nQuestions\n1. What are the key planning activities undertaken by the Mc Kinsey group for\ntheir clients?\n2. Why are private sector activities linked with that of the public sector in planning?\nWhat are their implications?\n3. Why do various governments give credibility to Mc Kinsey in planning? What does\nthe company offer as added value in its international business prospect?\nCauses of corporate planning failure\nCorporate planning is important in the public sector but there are reasons to believe that\nfailure might exist in this area. The Guide for Pacific Policy Makers (2013) identifies certain\ncauses of corporate planning failure Successful implementation of the corporate plan is as\nmuch about recognising, managing, and avoiding the common causes of failure as it is\nabout positive change management.8\nParticular causes of corporate planning failure in the public sector include:\n- a lack of knowledge and understanding of what corporate planning involves.\n- a lack of appreciation that the real value lies in the planning process rather than\nin the documentation.\n- a lack of senior management involvement, commitment, and leadership.\n- a lack of the application of management judgment, risk assessment, and choice to\nthe range of stakeholder requirements acting on the organisation.\n- lack of accountability.\n- a lack of alignment between the corporate plan and the job descriptions and\nperformance assessment system.\n- attempting to impose a private sector planning model on the public sector without\nconsidering public.\n- private sector differences.\n- freezing the plan as soon as it is produced; corporate planning should be a living,\nevolving process.\n- too little focus on implementation and change management.\n- too little focus on managing the commitment of the staff toward the corporate plan.\n- allowing the plan to become too complex and unwieldy to the point where it is\nnot usable anymore as a day-to-day management document for all staff levels.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n33 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nInsight: Short-termism and the public sector\nShort-termism is not only restricted to private-sector decisions about investment but can be\nrelated to policy decisions by governments. The pressure for short-termism in Government can\narise in much the same way as it might in business. The power and ability of Governments\nand politicians to determine policies and influence the national agenda depends on remaining\nin government \u2013 that is, on the ongoing approval or satisfaction of the electorate. Accordingly,\njust as company executives might be motivated by the expectations of investors to adopt\nstrategies aimed at delivering highly visible short-term results to protect their positions, so\ntoo might elected governments and politicians.\nPossible Causes\nHighlighting these short-term pressures is not intended to suggest that politicians or\ngovernments are driven exclusively by this focus or that it is the sole focus throughout\nan entire term in office. Yet, the overriding interest of politicians is to remain in or attain\noffice by reacting to immediate electoral issues and concerns or more specifically to those\nconstituencies that are particularly important to their re-election.9\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n3344 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nThis is obviously no bad thing. After all, governments are elected to represent the interests\nand preferences of voters. In reality, however, there is no such thing as a perfectly functioning\ndemocracy and there is not complete certainty of outcomes \u2013 for voters or politicians \u2013\nin elections. Policy choices can be highly complicated and difficult to convey, and often\npoliticians and the bureaucracies that support them tend to have a monopoly on information\nabout the relative long-term costs and benefits of different policies.\nTaking these factors into consideration, and against the backdrop of the political realities,\ngovernments may exhibit public policy short-termism in the following ways:\n- avoiding policies that have significant and clear short-term costs and/or less visible\nbenefits that flow over the longer term.\n- cutting spending in areas where it is difficult to observe the consequences of those\ncuts (especially over the short term).\n- adopting policies for which winners are concentrated and losers dispersed.\n- adopting short-term policies around elections that are not part of, or are inconsistent\nwith, their broader long-term, policy strategy, including some which can be recouped\nafter the election (such as spending that can be wound back or met by higher taxes\nonce a Government is re-elected) and/or\n- neglecting to discuss issues for which the costs of avoidance are not easily observable.\nShort-termism or planning myopia\nIt is correct to associate short-termism with planning myopia in the government. This has\nlittle to do with criticism since short-term planning or actions are more likely to take place\nthan long-term planning.\nWeaknesses of short-termism\n- Plans do not consider environmental factors that are likely to affect them.\n- Short-term plans evidence planning myopia. What are the uncertainties of the future?\n- Short-term plans may not bring about concrete results as important activities and\ngoals may not be fulfilled in a few years only.\n- Short-term planning may require senior public officials to plan on a piecemeal\napproach that is dangerous for the future of the departments.\n- Short-term planning can be costly as each time new action should be undertaken.\nThis easily adds to costs or overheads affecting the Ministry.\n- Short-term planning is difficult for review and adjustment as measurement in the\nshort-term may not provide genuine conclusions.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n35 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nDeveloping and implementing a medium-term framework\nDeveloping and implementing a medium-term framework for linking policy, planning and\nbudgeting can be accomplished progressively at a pace that fits a country\u2019s capacities. Some\ncountries (like South Africa and Uganda) began by developing an overall medium-term\nframework for allocating resources between sectors through a top-down approach carried\nout by the Ministry of Finance. Others (such as Malawi) began with a more bottom-up\napproach, focusing first on developing MTEFs at the sector level to govern resource allocation\nwithin individual sectors. Countries often choose to begin at the sector level because this\nrepresents a manageable change from the status quo.10\nStill, this approach should only be viewed as a building block to achieving a comprehensive\nmedium-term approach. In the case of Pakistan, the sector approach has proven an important\ncatalyst for focusing attention on government wide systems and processes. Many of the\npotential gains at the sector level, however, cannot be realised until the sector approach is\ncombined with a central overall planning, resource allocation and budgeting system that\nsupports a better balance between policies and resources at the intersectoral level.\nFurther, too much dependence on a sector focus can limit opportunities for responses that\ngo beyond the sector. For example, the most effective health sector response might lie in\nthe water sector, yet consideration of this could be excluded through a sector approach\nconfined to health.\nTactical planning\nTactical planning is mid-term planning based over a time frame of one to three years or\nusually less than five years. It is in the middle of the road between operational and tactical\nplanning. Governments are now keener to have agendas which are in between the two \u2013 the\nshort and the long-term plan. A convincing argument here could be that government aims\nat completing its major plans within its mandate. In democracies, the typical time frame\nfor government to stay in power is deemed to be five years. Since there is a possibility for\na change at the Head of the State, these governments would like to have their agendas\ncomplete or near completion within the five years.\nThere is also the other argument in favour of tactical planning. The costs of major projects\nkeep rising. The more time is wasted for such projects, the higher tends to be the cost. It\nbecomes imperative for governments to consider the viability of mid-term planning and\nprefer it to long-term plans that bear, at times, exaggerated costs.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n36 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor Planning\nA third argument in favour of tactical planning is the availability of amenities and services to\ncustomers. In a fast changing business environment affected by technological developments,\ngovernments are more willing to offer services in a shorter time span. For instance, the\nprovision of high debit internet connections could be on the agenda of several governments.\nThe quicker the service is available to customers, the better will be the perception that will\nbe developed of the government.\nIn this sense, tactical planning fits well on the agenda of governments being both a political\nand socially-demanding issue. It is therefore a choice of the government to decide how and\nwhy to opt for mid-term state planning.\nIIIIIIIIIInnnnnnnnnn tttttttttthhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeee ppppppppppaaaaaaaaaasssssssssstttttttttt

They entail judgments on the pace and sequence of\ninnovation, the organs that should be entrusted with the task, the sectors on which\nreform is to be concentrated, the political cast given the reforms, the extent to which the\ngovernment associates or distances itself from the changes, decisions on whether to proceed\nby administrative fiat or through legislative authorisation, and many other implementation\ndecisions. A good tactician considers how strategy can best be executed in the light of\navailable opportunities. Tactical skill requires institutional memory, a keen sense of timing\nand hard-nosed decisions on the approach to be taken.11\nPoints\nPlanning remains an important consideration for the public sector.

As explained earlier, it has a tall, formalised structure owing to many employees\nand departments. Organisation could not have been easy in the sector if such a structure\nand formalised practices would not be adopted. Permanent Secretaries and top executives\nin the public sector have to see how effective they should organise their activities so that\nthey take place without major problem.\nIt is logical to assume activities take place accordingly but there is time consumption in\nhaving them processed before feedback is given to recipients. All departments do not display\nthe same characteristics; some consider rapid feedback while others may confine themselves\nwith many procedures which halt the speed which the public sector would normally be\nexpected to work.\nOrganisational Concepts\nBannock Consulting (1999) provides a useful summary of the functions that public sector\nbodies undertake and that should be distinguished before reviewing organisational form:1\n1. Policy functions: such as strategic planning, legal drafting, development of performance\ncontracts, minimum standards, norms, policy analysis and evaluation, forecasting.\nThese functions tend to be seen as \u2018inherently governmental\u2019 and requiring specialist\nskills, and are usually provided by core ministries within central government.\n2. Co-ordination, supervision and performance monitoring functions: such as coordinating\nrelationships between different bodies, monitoring the performance of subsidiary\nbodies, facilitating and enabling subsidiary bodies to reach their performance targets.\nThese functions also tend to be seen as \u2018inherently governmental\u2019 and undertaken\nby core ministries.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n41 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\n3. Service delivery functions: such as the provision of products or services to internal\n(other public bodies) or external (farmers, foresters, fishermen) customers. Service\ndelivery is often provided outside of central government through contracting\narrangements or by subnational government. When undertaken by central government\nthis is normally performed by supervised bodies or executing agencies.\n4. Support functions: such as financial management, human resources management,\ninformation systems, infrastructure, staff training, efficiency review and management\naudit; and secretarial services. These are increasingly contracted out except when\nseen as inherently governmental for security or other reasons.\n5. Regulatory functions: such as licensing, certification, permissions, accreditation,\ninspection, compliance, and financial audit. These functions are also often seen as\n\u2018inherently governmental\u2019 and provided by statutory commissions and other arm\u2019s\nlength bodies within central government.\nFormal and informal organisation\nA formal organisation means the intentional structure of roles in a formally organised\nenterprise. In a formal organisation, there is nothing inherently inflexible or unduly\nconfining about it. On the other hand, formal organisations must be flexible. There should\nbe room for discretion for taking advantage of creative talents, and for the recognition of\nindividual capacities.\nChester Barnard, a management theorist, saw informal organisation as any joint personal\nactivity without conscious joint purpose, even though contributing to joint results.2 Informal\norganisation improves communication, enhances cohesiveness within formal organisation,\nand protects people\u2019s integrity.\nThe design of organisation structures should also assist in the creation of opportunities to\nemployees at lower levels so that there can be chances for upward mobility or promotion.\nToo often tall structures overlook such an aspect by maintaining a high level of rigidity\nthat stifles opportunities for advancement. It is therefore strongly wished to develop flexible\nstructures that can help motivate public officers.\nTypes of Organisational Structure in the Public Sector\nFeigenbaum (2016) identifies three types of public organisation structures namely\nvertical, horizontal and divisional that exist in the public service with their relevance to\nworkplace situations.3\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n42 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nVertical Structures\nMost government organisations are classic examples of vertical structure. Vertical organisational\nstructures are characterised by few people at the top and increasing numbers of people in\nmiddle management and lower-level positions. Few people make policy decisions, and many\npeople enact them. Governments often lean toward them because they create defined job\nscopes and powers \u2013 each person has a clear role to play. Vertical structure is the classic\nbureaucracy and is epitomised and originated in one of the oldest government functions:\nmilitary command.\nHorizontal Structures\nHorizontal organisation charts are characterised by a few positions at top and then many\npositions on the next row down. In other words, there are very few supervisors and many\npeers or equals. While this structure is most common in professional organisations such as\nlaw and architecture firms or medical practices, a few types of government use this structure.\nFor instance, in very small programmes \u2013 especially after budget cutbacks \u2013 certain city and\ncounty social services such as drug prevention or domestic violence education programmes\nmay find themselves with only a few staff members. To deliver services or because they do\njob sharing, staff may work together cooperatively rather than in hierarchical order.\nAAAAAAAAAAAAmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnn

organisation\nDivisional Structures\nDivisional structures divide function and responsibility based on speciality or geography \u2013\nsuch as a market territory. In the case of the public sector, a few organisations such as courts\nuse this system. For example, federal courts are divided into regional circuits and even most\ncounties have multiple courthouses which hear cases from their defined territories within\nthe country. These courts run parallel and are not affected by one another. Similarly, police\nand fire departments usually have precincts and battalions with specific jurisdictions for\nbetter functionality.\nDegree of formalisation through the organisational structure\n- Administrative Secretaries have to execute tasks as advised by the Permanent Secretary.\n- Clerical Officers have to execute tasks as assigned by Executive Officers.\n- Orders come from the top.\n- Communication is essentially top-down.\n- Rules and regulations are devised by senior executives and should be abided by\njunior staff.\n- Activities are devised according to procedures established in the Ministry.\n- Any important matter is agreed by senior staff.\n- There is an established mechanism for complaints or grievances.\nOrganisation structure and design\nAn organisation structure describes the organisation framework expressed by its degree of\ncomplexity, formalisation and centralisation.\nComplexity\nComplexity considers the amount of differentiation in an organisation. The more differentiated\nand tall an organisation is, the more complex it becomes. Simple and lean organisations\nhave a lesser degree of complexity. The public sector is affected by complexity since there are\nseveral departments and hierarchies. Also, there are many employees working in the ministries.\nFormalisation\nFormalisation refers to the degree to which an organisation relies on rules and procedures\nto direct the behaviour of employees. Normally, in taller structures there can be a higher\ndegree of formalisation. In smaller and flatter organisations, this may be reduced to a great\nextent. Formalisation, as explained earlier characterises the public service through procedures,\npolicies and abidance to rules. Formalisation can be said to create inflexibility.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n44 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nCentralisation\nCentralisation is concerned with the concentration of decision making authority in upper\nmanagement. In the former communist system, there was a high degree of centralisation.\nPower and authority resided in the hands of leaders and top executives. In a centralised\nmodel, decisions about the work or common tasks such as research, policy development,\nfinancial reporting, HR activities or filing are undertaken by a \u2018central\u2019 division whose only\nrole is to perform these tasks.4\nThey perform this work for all the other divisions in the organisation. A variant of this\nconcept is a shared service, where certain common functions \u2013 typically corporate functions \u2013\nare shared across multiple agencies or business units.\nThrough the co-location of people with similar skill sets and work activities, centralisation\ncan foster the development of highly specialised capabilities.\nThe benefits of centralisation can include greater innovation, arising from pooling of\nknowledge and expertise, cost savings arising from building core abilities or standardising\nprocedures, and greater cohesion across the whole organisation because different parts of\nthe organisation come together at the centralised point.\nMany public sector organisations move between centralisation and decentralisation over\ntime. They do this to capitalise on the benefits of each model that are appropriate for\ndifferent stages of the organisation\u2019s lifecycle or the demands of the operating environment.\nFor example, an organisation that is lacking cohesion or is having to work with reduced\nresources may move to centralisation. An organisation whose work has become more varied\nmay move to decentralisation.\nDecentralisation\nOrganisations that develop and expand definitely need to decentralise their operations for\nsome reasons. Government aims at decentralising its activities to better attain the needs of\nlocal citizens. As such, government organisations work more closely with the public and\nthe State is relieved from excessive co-ordination of tasks.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n45 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nA case for decentralisation\n- Decentralisation helps government to have activities spread in various regions of a\ncountry. It better reaches the local community.\n- It helps executives to take decisions on their own provided that they are empowered\nto do so.\n- It improves flexibility in the activities in that they reach the community more rapidly.\n- Better solutions can be implemented locally in line with the reality.\n- Time can be saved by overcoming transport and disturbance.\nInsight: Policy implications for decentralisation5\nDecentralisation holds much promise, but whether it improves public service delivery depends\non the institutional arrangements governing its implementation. Several conditions must be\nmet before the full benefits of decentralisation can be reaped. First, for decentralisation to\nincrease allocative and productive efficiency, local governments need to have the authority to\nrespond to local demand as well as adequate mechanisms for accountability. Because granting\nauthority without accountability can lead to corruption and lower productive efficiency,\ndecentralisation needs to be accompanied by reforms that increase the transparency and\naccountability of local government.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n4466 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nSecond, functions need to be devolved to a low enough level of government for allocative\nefficiency to increase because of decentralisation. Low-level governments are likely to be aware\nof local preferences and, if able to do so, are likely to adjust service delivery accordingly.\nThird, citizens should have channels to communicate their preferences and get their voices\nheard in local governments. But the existence of such channels is not enough. Influence\npublic policies and oversee local governments, citizens need to have information about\ngovernment policies and activities. The media play countries radio is especially important\nfor disseminating information about government. The media, however, tend to focus on\nnational events and politics. In a decentralised environment, adequate coverage of local\nevents and politics is also important.\nOrganisation design\nThe construction or changing of an organisation\u2019s structure is referred to as organisation\ndesign. Every organisation is designed in its own way in relation to the above-mentioned\nfactors. Organisational design is the art of dividing an organisation into operational parts,\nthen connecting those parts together through structural arrangements and mechanisms for\nco-production, direction and control. The aim of organisational design is to ensure that the\norganisation works well and that it can deliver the results expected of it using the resources\nthat are available to it.6\nA poorly designed organisation will mean that the organisation will be taking more time,\nspending more money, losing more corporate knowledge, and losing more good staff than is\nwarranted. If the organisation is poorly designed, it may not be able to produce the results\nexpected of it at all.\nCase Study: Demystifying organisation design in the public sector7\nNew strategies \u2013 or shifts in existing ones \u2013 frequently require organisations to rethink how\nthey are set up; changes that are not accompanied by such a fundamental re-evaluation cannot\nhave a lasting impact. This holds particularly true in the public sector, where organisations\nare regularly adapting to an ever-evolving environment, realigning to new leaders, navigating\nnew responsibilities, and collaborating across jurisdictions or political lines. Organisation\ndesign should be at the heart of these changes in strategic direction.\nSo far, organisation design is frequently an afterthought for change-related programmes in\nboth the public and private sectors.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n47 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nIn the public sector, change is often driven by new directions in policy and new political\nagendas. Whether incremental changes or fundamental reforms, these new directions are often\nset without much thought for the impact that they will have on government organisations.\nThis occurs in part because, regardless of the source of the reform, leaders of public-sector\norganisations are responsible for adopting these changes and making them happen. Faced\nwith constraints such as limited terms and legislative or regulatory requirements, leaders\ncan find organisation design a low priority when they are just looking to get reforms done.\nBut organisation design can provide effective and practical solutions to many stubborn\nissues confronting public-sector leaders. There are three main elements of organisation\ndesign \u2013 structure, individual capabilities, and roles and collaboration \u2013 that are essential to\nmake change effective. In fact, there is a dynamic interplay among them. When structure,\nindividual capabilities, and roles and collaboration are in alignment \u2013 and tightly linked with\nan organisation\u2019s strategy and mission \u2013 public-sector reforms are more likely to succeed.\nAdapted from: Shananan, M., Bailey, A., and Puckett, J. (2011) Demystifying Organisation\nDesign in the Public Sector, bcg.perspectives.\nQuestions\n1. What are the factors forcing public organisations to change their structure?\n2. What are the three elements of organisation design? Explain.\n3. Identify the dynamic interplay between the key elements of organisation design.\nSimplifying design of the public organisation\nThere is a political belief that more effective government can best be achieved by simplifying\nthe complex and confusing landscape of public sector organisations. This will make it\neasier for the public to access services and for the organisations involved in developing\nand delivering them to provide a better, more joined-up service. In Scotland, for example,\ndelivery structures need to develop a more integrated approach to cut through and remove\nbureaucratic barriers. Institutional arrangements in our public services need to make sense\nfor a country of 5 million. This means a clearer, more focussed organisational landscape that\nwill be more effective in driving forward our other commitments to change and improve\nservice delivery.8\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n48 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nIn this attempt to simplify organisational design, the Scottish Government\u2019s vision is to achieve:\n- simpler structures which support the achievement of the Scottish Government\u2019s\nnational strategic aims and local government\u2019s delivery of better outcomes for\nlocal communities\n- transparent and clear public service decision-making, with streamlined scrutiny and\ncontrol regimes, which facilitate Scotland\u2019s capacity to mobilise capital and grow\nour economy\n- fewer, better structured arm\u2019s length bodies at a national level; which receive clear\nand integrated strategic direction from Government, while at the same time given\nroom to deliver.\n- collaboration and joint-working between public services, which is essential for\ndelivering better services, facilitated through less heavy formal structures and fewer\norganisational boundaries cutting across decision-making.\nRegional orientation\nThe main functions are kept at the headquarters. Some activities are decentralised on a\nterritorial basis \u2013 North, South, West, Central. Many large organisations are decentralised\nin a geographical way.\n..............\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n4499 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nEstablishing regions and decentralisation contribute to:\n- reduction of regional imbalances by stimulating balanced development, accelerated\nrecovery of delays in the economic and social field of the less developed areas,\ndue to historical, geographical, economic, social, political conditions, as well as\nprevention of new imbalances.\n- correlation of the governmental sectoral policies at regional level, by stimulating\ninitiatives and valorising local and regional resources, aimed at a sustainable economic\nand social development, at their cultural development and at territorial cohesion.9\nIt should be pointed out, however, that the existence of regional, provincial or local\nadministrations does not guarantee in itself distance from the centre. Compared with\nfrequent general provisions in which the principles of decentralisation or subsidiarity are\naffirmed, the national governments\u2019 powers of control and influence on policy are often\nvery pervasive.10\nAdvantages\n- Regional orientation places responsibility at a lower level.\n- It places emphasis on local markets and needs.\n- There is better face-to-face communication with local interests.\n- There is a possibility of creating a training ground for future managers.\nDisadvantages\n- It requires persons with more general manager abilities.\n- There can be a problem of top management control.\nGovernment\u2019s choice for regional orientation\nSince the nineties, the government has been a proponent for decentralisation. Various motives\nhave influenced the public sector to become more decentralised.\n- Traffic jam creates lots of problems and inconvenience to people.\n- Decentralisation ensures that all the people get better access to governmental services.\n- Expenditure can be minimised depending on situations.\n- There may be more motivation for employees to provide better service, given they\ndo not face such transport difficulty or disturbance.\n- Public service becomes more responsive to the needs of the community.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n50 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nNew organisational orientations in public sector\nFlexitime\nOften termed flexible working hours, flexitime is one of the most widely used alternatives\nto the 9\u20135 office pattern, and gives individual employees control over when to start and\nend their working day. It is popular with employers as well as employees as it can combine\nset or \u2018core\u2019 times of common agreement when all employees should be at work, with parts\nthat can be individually adapted.11\nFlexitime is a long standing and well used scheme, but there is a need to look at it afresh,\nand reassess its relevance for the higher education sector. This is in the light of changing\norganisational culture, and within the context of achieving greater work/life balance for\nemployees. Good work/life practices, of which flexitime is one, offer a win-win situation for\nemployees and employers in the higher education sector. Generally, there is a lack of data\non the extent of flexible working in the sector, but flexitime is believed to be widespread,\nwith informal flexibility in daily hours more the norm than formal schemes.\nIn some institutions however, formal flexitime policies have been in use for many years, and\nthe time may now be right for reviewing these within the context of considering the work/\nlife balance of all employees. Although flexitime is the most popular way of varying daily\nhours it has its limitations, and is not suitable for all job roles and workplaces, and other\nflexible options may provide better solutions. Flexitime works best, as with all alternative\nworking patterns, as part of a package of options available to help employees balance their\nwork and personal lives and the organisation meet its business goals.\nIn Mauritius, the Pay Research Bureau, a salary commission institution, maintains that the\nintroduction of flexitime has several advantages and would be beneficial to both employees\nand organisations. It would relieve officers of their routine stress and help them to better\nmanage the balance between work commitments, family responsibilities and lifestyle choices\nto the advantage of the service. Today\u2019s workforce increasingly consists of women, and workers\nin alternative family structures, such as single-headed and dual-earner families. Faced with\nmore pressing demands from both the workplace and home, these employees must often\ndivide time between these two competing interests. Among those most likely to benefit from\ngreater workplace flexibility are prime working-age women, women household heads, and\nemployees in two-earner families. Employees who would prefer this work pattern should, if\npossible, be allowed to make that choice which would help them to better cope with both\nthe work and the household and child care responsibilities.12\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n51 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor organisation\nGovernment had previously considered flexi-time as an alternative to restructure activities.\nFlexitime operates as follows:\n- Employees may call at work either at 9 a.m. or at 10 a.m.\n- There will be core hours where each employee meets.\n- Flexitime allows room for flexibility at work.\n- Absenteeism can be remedied.\n- Employees may be more motivated to work.\n- Flexitime can help to save in terms of costs and overheads.\nPoints\nThe public service operates according to a well-defined organisational and fairly rigid hierarchy.\nA formal organisation means the intentional structure of roles in a formally organised\nenterprise. Most government organisations are classic examples of vertical structure.\nHorizontal organisation charts are characterised by a few positions at top and then many\npositions on the next row down.\nJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJoooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeee bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssttttttttttttttt

In an era where\nall people at work are users of smart technology, governments have discrete accepted and\nadopted new technological platforms to better serve the citizens. In a formal structure, let\nus say, back in the 1980s, paper work was popular and typical to bureaucratic organisations\nlike the public service. Still, relying heavily on paper work can be the modus operandi\nof public bodies. But, changes are taking place worldwide prompting all governments to\nmodernise by embracing e-government as a useful stand to communicate with the public.\nOver the years, it has become customary for any user of government information or data to\nclick on the State portal and find out the numerous possibilities of benefiting from services\navailable online and at the click of the mouse. This chapter eventually embraces the relevance\nof e-government and purports it as the most vital tool that the State can have to better meet\nthe demanding needs of the population. The topics covered include defining e-government,\nthe purpose for e-government, e-readiness as well as opportunities and challenges therein.\nDefining e-Government\nThere are several definitions on e-Government meaning almost the same but having a slight\ndifferent view on it. This chapter analyses the various definitions of e-Government and how\nclose these might be related. The main approach on e-Government can be described as follows:\nWith the internet, e-Government can be used to work on and to solve political and social\nissues increasingly local: close to the point of origin. As such, e-Government creates a more\neffective and a more citizen orientated government with less costs for the administration.\nE-Government refers to the simplification and the transaction of business processes by the\nuse of information and communication technology (ICT) in the context of governance and\npublic administration.\ne-Government is the use of information and communication technologies in public\nadministrations \u2013 combined with organisational change and new skills \u2013 to improve public\nservices and democratic processes and to strengthen support to public policies.\ne-Government is understood as the execution of administrative tasks and processes with the\nhelp of technical tools and media.1\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n56 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nThe World Bank, (2012) defines e-Government as the use by government agencies of\ninformation technologies such as Wide Area Networks, the Internet, and mobile computing\nthat have the ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of\ngovernment. These technologies can serve a variety of different ends: better delivery of\ngovernment services to citizens, improved interactions with business and industry, citizen\nempowerment through access to information, or more efficient government management.\nThe resulting benefits can be less corruption, increased transparency, greater convenience,\nrevenue growth, and/or cost reductions.2\nE-government\u2019s popularity\nE-government has become a popular focus of government efforts in many countries around\nthe world. More and more governments around the world have implemented and introduced\ne-government systems as a means of reducing costs, improving services, saving time and\nincreasing effectiveness and efficiency in the public sector. E-government and Internet has\nmade an essential change in the whole society structure, values, culture and the ways of\nconducting business by utilizing the potential of ICT as a tool in the daily work.\nAccording to Alsheri and Drew (2007), the purpose of e-government is not only the\nconversion of traditional information into bits and bytes and making it reachable via the\ninternet websites or giving government officials computers or automating old practices to\nan electronic platform. But it also calls for rethinking ways the government functions are\ncarried out today to improve processes and integration.3\nGovernments have different strategies to build e-government. Some have created comprehensive\nlong-term plans. Others have opted to identify just a few key areas as the focus of early\nprojects. In all cases, however, the countries identified as most successful have begun with\nsmaller projects in phases on which to build a structure. E-government researchers divide\nthe process of e-government implementation into phases or stages.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n57 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nA business case for e-government4\nE-government is now widely seen as being fundamental to reform, modernisation and\nimprovement of government. The OECD defines e-government as \u201cthe use of information\nand communication technologies (ICTs), and particularly the Internet, as a tool to achieve\nbetter government\u201d. However, the real costs of and benefits of e-government have rarely\nbeen soundly and systematically evaluated. During the \u2018dot.com\u2019 boom, e-government\nenjoyed a healthy level of political and financial support. ICTs and e-government were seen\nas key tools for modernising public administrations and providing better government. The\nnext stage of e-government, however, is likely to require investment in the development of\nservices and systems whose benefits will sometimes be less readily apparent to politicians\nand policy makers, and to the public. This means that robust evaluation and monitoring of\nthe costs and benefits of e-government needs to be better incorporated into e-government\nplanning and investment. This is commonly referred as the need for e-government to be\nsupported by a strong \u2018business case\u2019. Without this, e-government implementers will find it\nincreasingly difficult to obtain support for making the investments required to enable them\nto achieve the objectives that governments set for them.\nNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddddddddd hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllppppppppppppppppp wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\ndddddddddddddddddiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn?????????????????\nGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeettttttttttttttttt iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-----------------dddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepppppppppppppppppttttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fffffffffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddddddddddddddddbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddddddddvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee fffffffffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxpppppppppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttttttttsssssssssssssssss iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\ntttttttttttttttttooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccc aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.................

The end goal should be access\nfor opportunity, rather than solely access to ICT. In this context the governments need to\ndevelop and formally adopt E-government Plans and/or similar national ICT Plans that\ninclude access goals, economic development objectives, and long-term goals to achieve a\nknowledge economy/society.\nGovernments need to focus on knowledge societies\nGovernments need to re-think and re-engineer their development strategies towards building\nknowledge societies. A renewed commitment is needed to put ICTs within an integrated\ndevelopment framework to leap-frog the traditional long gestation phases of development\nand yield rapid economic and social progress for all. Governments need to include ICTs\nin all planning initiatives: To improve access-for-opportunity, countries must recognise the\ncentrality of ICTs to development. The governments need to include ICT planning across\nall government sectors, particularly public education, public health, economic development,\ncommerce and industry, law enforcement and security, and others \u2013 this integrated planning\nwill lead to real e-government and ICT for development. E-government and ICT goals should\nbe clearly articulated in terms of economic development and quality of life enhancements\nfor all members of society.\nE-readiness\u2019 concept\nAccording to the Economist Intelligence Unit report (2009), digital development marches\non. Connectivity continues to improve, and remains the major enabling factor for any\ncountry\u2019s ability to improve its e-readiness. Availability, however, is not enough to reap the\nfull benefits of the ICT equation analysis shows that usage lags connectivity levels \u2013 another\nreason that overall scores have dropped this year \u2013 but that users around the world are finding\nincreasing utility nonetheless, even in countries in the lower tiers of our ranking table.5\nWhile usage levels are still in their infancy, encouraging signs are seen, ranging from\ne-participation efforts to actual use of online public services. In rich and poor countries\nalike, however, thorny policy issues arising from the very success of digital development\nremain largely unresolved. Widespread Internet usage, for example, naturally motivates\ntelecoms carriers and content providers to explore ways to obtain more information \u2013 and\nthus sales \u2013 from their customers.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n59 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nThe delicate social contract between digital consumers and the operators of digital channels\nwill be tested in the coming years, as intensified revenue pressure increases service providers\u2019\nneed to utilise the Internet for intrusions that are both annoying for example, inbound\nadvertising and potentially privacy-infringing (\u2018deep-packet\u2019 inspection systems. The\nenvironmental impact of ICT usage is also likely to remain a concern for governments as\nlong as climate change and carbon reduction remain high on the global agenda.\nAs the digitally connected world watches more videos and transfers more files, it consumes\nmore energy. The expansion of one of the global economy\u2019s most essential resources \u2013\ninformation \u2013 is having an unintended knock-on effect on other precious resources. The\ninterplay between these two resource ecosystems underscores once again the reality that\ne-readiness is not fostered in a digital vacuum, but rather in a complex web of social, cultural,\neconomic and political factors, ultimately driven by the usage imperative.\nCase Study: E-government\u2019s value\nE-government and innovation can provide significant opportunities to transform public\nadministration into an instrument of sustainable development. E-government is \u2018the use\nof ICT and its application by the government for the provision of information and public\nservices to the people\u2019 (Global E-Government Readiness Report 2004).6\nMore broadly, e-government can be referred to as the use and application of information\ntechnologies in public administration to streamline and integrate workflows and processes, to\nmanage data and information, enhance public service delivery, as well as expand communication\nchannels for engagement and empowerment of people. The opportunities offered by the\ndigital development of recent years, whether through online services, big data, social media,\nmobile apps, or cloud computing, are expanding the way we look at e-government.7\nThe World Bank has embraced e-government in its efforts to modernise public sector and\nimprove public sector delivery. For this reason, e-government initiatives are present in most\nprojects in the Sector. E-government is considered a key facilitator to achieve the proposed\nreforms supported by the rest of the core areas, from public financial management to\nanti-corruption, including improving service delivery for citizens. In numerous projects, it\nhas been demonstrated that e-government has had a remarkable impact on improving the\nefficiency and integration of public sector.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n60 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nWhile e-government still includes electronic interactions of three types: government-to-\ngovernment (G2G); government-to-business (G2B); and government-to-consumer (G2C) \u2013\na more holistic and multi-stakeholder approach is taking shape. Through innovation and\ne-government, public administrations around the world can be more efficient, provide better\nservices and respond to demands for transparency and accountability. E-government can\nhelp governments go green and promote effective natural resource management, as well as\nstimulate economic growth and promote social inclusion, particularly of disadvantaged and\nvulnerable groups. ICTs have also proven to be effective platforms to facilitate knowledge\nsharing, skills development, transfer of innovative e-government solutions and capacity-\nbuilding for sustainable development among countries. E-government can generate important\nbenefits in the form of new employment, better health and education.\nQuestions\n1. What are the opportunities offered by digital technology in the advent of e-government?\n2. What are the implications behind the World Bank\u2019s initiative to promote e-government\nworldwide?\n3. Why is it necessary to speak of e-government\u2019s benefits? What could be some of\nits limitations?\nBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

four stage e-government development and propose a \u2018stages of growth\u2019 model for fully\nfunctional e-Government.\nStage 1: Cataloguing\nIn stage one of cataloguing, initial efforts of state governments are focused on establishing\nan on-line presence for the government.\nStage 2: Transaction\nIn the transaction stage, e-Government initiatives will focus on connecting the internal\ngovernment system to on-line interfaces and allowing citizens to transact with government\nelectronically.\nStage 3: Vertical integration\nVertical integration refers to local, state and federal governments connected for different\nfunctions or services of government.\nStage 4: Horizontal integration\nHorizontal integration is defined as integration across different functions and services. In\ndefining the stages of e-government development, the vertical integration across different\nlevels within similar functionality is posited to precede the horizontal integration across\ndifferent functions.\nModels of e-government\nModels of e-Government are discussed in this section. Firstly, the Government to Government\nModel (G2G) relates how e-Government can be successfully implemented within state\norganisations, Government to business (G2B) deals with public and private sector interaction,\nand Government to Citizens (G2C) deals with the relationship between government and\ncitizens. As such, one can note the pervasive use and implementation of e-government in\nall spheres of society.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n62 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nGovernment to Government Model (G2G)\nAccording to Gregory (2007) G2G refers to the online communications between government\norganisations, departments and agencies based on a super-government database. Moreover,\nit refers to the relationship between governments. The efficiency and efficacy of processes\nare enhanced by the use of online communication and cooperation which allows for the\nsharing of databases and resources and the fusion of skills and capabilities. The vital aim\nof G2G development is to enhance and improve inter-government organisational processes\nby streamlining cooperation and coordination. Governments depend on other levels of\ngovernment within the state to deliver services and allocate responsibilities.9\nIn promoting citizen-centric service, a single access point to government is the ultimate goal,\nfor which cooperation among different governmental departments and agencies is needed.\nG2G facilitates the sharing of databases, resources and capabilities, enhancing the efficiency\nand effectiveness of processes. It represents internal systems and procedures which form the\nbackbone of public organizations. G2G involves sharing data and conducting electronic\ntransactions between governmental actors. This includes both intra and inter-agency interactions\nbetween employees, departments, agencies, ministries and even other governments.\nGovernment-to-Business (G2B)\nGovernment to business, or G2B, is the second major type of e-government category. G2B\ncan bring significant efficiencies to both governments and businesses. G2B include various\nservices exchanged between government and the business sectors, including distribution of\npolicies, memos, rules and regulations. Business services offered include obtaining current\nbusiness information, new regulations, downloading application forms, claiming taxes,\nrenewing licenses, registering businesses, obtaining permits, and many others. The opportunity\nto conduct online transactions with government reduces red tape and simplifies regulatory\nprocesses, therefore helping businesses to become more competitive.10\nGovernment-to-Citizens (G2C)\nG2C deals with the relationship between government and citizens. It allows citizens to access\ngovernment information and services instantly, conveniently, from everywhere, by use of\nmultiple channels. Government-to-Citizens (G2C) model have been designed to facilitate\ncitizen interaction with the government. The focus of G2C is customer centric and integrated\nelectronic services where public services can be provided based on a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 concept.\nThis implies that citizens can carry out a variety of tasks, especially those that involve multiple\nagencies, without needing to initiate contacts with each individual agency. While e-Administration\ninitiatives improve internal government processes, e-Citizens and e-Services deal with improving\ncommunication and quality of service between government and citizens. Finally, e-Society\ninitiatives concern interactions of government with businesses and civil communities. As each\ndomain develops and progresses, e-Government initiatives may increasingly fall into overlaps.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n63 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nE-government\u2019s benefits11\nAccording to the World Bank (2002) E-Governance has the following benefits:\n- It greatly simplifies the process of information accumulation for citizens and businesses.\n- It empowers people to gather information on any government department and get\ninvolved in the process of decision making.\n- E-Governance strengthens the very fabric of democracy by ensuring greater citizen\nparticipation at all levels of governance.\n- E-Governance leads to automation of services, ensuring that information on every\nwork of public welfare is easily available to all citizens, eliminating corruption.\n- This revolutionises the way governments function, ensuring much more transparency\nin the functioning, thereby eliminating corruption.\n- Since the information on every government activity is easily available, it would\nmake every government department responsible as they know that every action of\ntheirs is closely monitored.\n- Proper implementation of e-Governance practices make it possible for people to get\ntheir work done online thereby sparing themselves of unneeded hassles of traveling\nto offices.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n6644 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\n- Successful implementation of e-Governance practices offer better delivery of services\nto citizens, improved interactions with business and industry, citizen empowerment\nthrough access to information, better management, greater convenience, revenue\ngrowth, and cost reductions.\n- Further, introduction of e-Governance brings governments closer to citizens. So much\nso that today it becomes extremely convenient to get in touch with a government\nagency. Citizen service centers are located closer to the citizens now. Such centers\nmay consist of an unattended kiosk in the government agency, a service kiosk\nlocated close to the client, or the use of a personal computer in the home or office.\n- E-Governance practices help business access information that might be important\nfor them at a click.\nE-government\u2019s challenges12\nThis section explains the challenges of e-Government. They are namely the digital divide,\nthe need to have effective infrastructure, a suitable and well defined law and policy on the\nuse of e-Government, including accessibility, trust from users and providers of e-services,\naccessibility and the human resources required to make e-Government a reality.\nDigital divide\nClass, race, ethnicity, geography and other factors could lead to groups of people being\ndisenfranchised. In many countries, content must be provided in more than one language\nor dialect. E-government must also discuss the needs of those who are illiterate. The digital\ndivide is the gap between people who have access to the Internet and those who do not.\nThose without access cannot learn essential computer skills, cannot access information that\ncan provide economic opportunities, and cannot share in the benefits of e-government.\nAn exemplary illustration of how the digital divide can be bridged to benefit the rural\npoor is the Gyandoot Project, where the Internet connected a remote part of India to the\ngovernment and the services it provides. As noted above, Jamaica enlisted postal workers\nto teach customers basic computer skills like email, and also created computer labs in local\nlibraries, with the goal of empowering the rural poor to explore opportunities beyond their\nsmall communities, including the opportunity for increased civic participation.\nBridging the digital divide means more than just discussing race and class issues. Successful\nprograms will create new opportunities for those who are traditionally isolated from government\nprogrammes. In particular, technology programs often leave women, immigrants and the\nelderly behind. An effort must be made to include these and other vulnerable groups.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n65 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nInfrastructure development\nAll countries implementing e-government have struggled to develop a basic infrastructure to\ntake advantage of new technologies and communications tools. Many developing countries,\neven if possessing the will, do not have infrastructure to deploy e-government services\nacross their territory now. These governments, such as the Andhra Pradesh state in India,\nmust include in their e-government strategies efforts to build out their ICT infrastructure,\ndeveloping novel approaches to solving the problem of remote connectivity to support\ne-government efforts. Others, such as Estonia, have partnered with the private sector to\ninvest in programs that increase access and create an e-ready society.\nLaw and public policy\nThe application of ICT to government may encounter legal or policy barriers. Legislatures\nmust ensure that laws are updated to recognize electronic documents and transactions. They\nmust take proactive steps to ensure that policies support rather than impede e-government.\nPolicymakers implementing e-government must consider the impact of law and public policy.\nOtherwise, any initiative will encounter significant problems. The effort must incorporate\na holistic view, one that is not just focused on technology. Archaic laws, old regulatory\nregimes, overlapping and conflicting authorities can all greatly complicate or altogether\nhalt a project. Legal reforms and new policy directives may have to be adopted before the\nonline world can function smoothly.\nAccessibility\nGovernments must serve all members of society irrespective of their physical capabilities.\nOnline services will have to be designed with appropriate interfaces \u2013 this may have\nsignificant cost implications. Some developing countries have sizable disabled populations.\nThese people could especially benefit from e-government services as they may not be able\nto travel to government offices. However, e-government projects need to accommodate the\nneeds of the disabled \u2013 such as those who are blind, or do not have use of their hands.\nThe World Wide Web Consortium is developing protocols and procedures to support\ndisabled people (those who are blind, deaf or otherwise handicapped) in using the Internet\nas freely as any other person. Those efforts include software solutions, policy initiatives, and\neducational conferences.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n66 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nTrust\nTo be successful, e-government projects must build trust in agencies, between agencies, across\ngovernments, and with businesses, NGOs and citizens. When conceptualizing e-government,\ndevelopers often do not realize the many boundaries, both physical and administrative,\nthat the proposed project will cross. Yet, the success of e-government often comes down to\nbuilding trust and common understanding with the variety of players early in the process.\nThe biggest concern for most parties is that change brought about by a new system will\nnegatively impact them. Almost every successful e-government project is a case example in\nbuilding trust. The issue of trust also involves two issues of special concern to any online\nservice: Privacy \u2013 protecting personal information the government collects about people.\nSecurity \u2013 protecting e-government sites from attack and misuse. Privacy and security issues\nhave received extensive international attention.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n6677 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nWorkforce issues\nHuman resources must be structured and managed with e-government goals in mind. A\nwell-trained and motivated workforce is critical to e-government success. Civil servants\nneed training and leadership to integrate themselves into the new information structure.\nPolicymakers need to expect that civil servants will feel threatened by e-government, either\nbecause they fear being caught for corruption or simply because they fear a loss of power.\nLeadership can play an important role and create a positive atmosphere for change by\nensuring adequate training and rewarding those who support e-government changes.\nCost structures\nWhile planning and budgeting in a changing climate is difficult, governments should seek\nto invest in sustainable programs that can produce savings. To implement a successful\ne-government program, policymakers need to develop specific and reasonably attainable\ngoals and understand what resources are available to achieve those goals. Only then will\nthey be able to formulate a plan that can be implemented in full, rather than being cut\nshort before any gains are realised due to lack of resources.\nEurope and e-government13\nThis section highlights the development of e-Government in Europe. Being a rich continent\nwith high levels of Internet penetration, Europe maintains the lead in e-Government. Certain\nelements of e-Government namely the conditions in which they apply and their road map\nfor effective e-Government are highlighted below.\nThe Malm\u00f6 Declaration sets out 4 political priorities for all European public administrations\nover the next 5 years:\n- Citizens and businesses are empowered by e-Government services designed around\nusers\u2019 needs and developed in collaboration with third parties, as well as by increased\naccess to public information, strengthened transparency and effective means for\ninvolvement of stakeholders in the policy process,\n- Mobility in the Single Market is reinforced by seamless e-Government services for\nthe setting up and running of a business and for studying, working, residing and\nretiring anywhere in the European Union,\n- Efficiency and effectiveness is enabled by a constant effort to use e-Government to\nreduce the administrative burden, improve organisational processes and promote a\nsustainable low-carbon economy,\n- The implementation of the policy priorities is made possible by creating the\nappropriate key enablers and by establishing legal and technical preconditions.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n68 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nGovernments need to provide better public services with fewer resources. Each of the above\npolitical priorities works towards that aim, as well as providing new and better ways to\nengage with citizens. The emergence of innovative technologies such as \u2018service-oriented\narchitectures\u2019 (SOA), or \u2018clouds\u2019 of services, together with more open specifications which\nallow for greater sharing, re-use and interoperability reinforce the ability of ICT to play a\nkey role in this quest for efficiency in the public sector.\nInsight: Small Island Developing State of Mauritius14\nThe government of Mauritius has put effort into developing their online portal and their\ntelecommunication infrastructure. Their website www.gov.mu offers citizens an exhaustive\nlist of e-services segmented by target persons (139 services), by domain (59 services), by\nministry (53 services), by department (13 services) and parastatally (14 services). Even\nthough Mauritius is one of the Small Island Developing States with a small land area and\npopulation, its economy has developed since independence from a small-scale focus based\non agriculture, to a diversified middle-income economy. This increased the government\u2019s\npotential to invest in infrastructure, communications and education, which raised the Human\nCapital Index of Mauritius and raised its ranking in the regional EGDI. The government\nportal also offers citizens a platform for e-participation through chat rooms, a media library,\nblogs and discussion forums.\nDeveloping nations\u2019 challenge\nOne of the main challenges for an e-Government project is the establishment of an appropriate\nand context tailored strategy. Every project or initiative needs to be rooted in a very careful,\nanalytical and dynamic strategy. This seems to be a very difficult task, requiring a focus on\nmany aspects and processes, a holistic vision, long-term focus and objectives. Many public\ninstitutions limit their activities to a simple transfer of their information and services online\nwithout taking into consideration the re-engineering process needed to grasp the full benefits.\nThe government must have a clear strategy to overcome the barriers to change. Part of the\nstrategy is to engage in a rigorous assessment of the current situation, the reality on the\nground and the inventory of projects, articulate costs, impacts and benefits of programme\nas well as continuously monitor and evaluate the project upgrading.15\nPoints\nE-government is heralded as the success of the public service of the future in an era where\nall people at work are users of smart technology.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n69 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nE-Government refers to the simplification and the transaction of business processes by the\nuse of ICT combined with organisational change and new skills to improve public services\nand democratic processes and to strengthen support to public policies.\nE-government is now widely seen as being fundamental to reform, modernisation and\nimprovement of government.\nE-government and innovation can provide significant opportunities to transform public\nadministration into an instrument of sustainable development.\nA four stage e-government development model for fully functional e-Government is\ncataloguing, transaction, vertical integration and horizontal integration.\nGovernment to business (G2B) deals with public and private sector interaction, and\nGovernment to Citizens (G2C) deals with the relationship between government and citizens.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n7700 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT e-government PraCtiCe\nThe benefits of e-government are simplifying the process of information accumulation for\ncitizens and businesses, empowering people to gather information, strengthening democracy\nby ensuring greater citizen participation and automation of services, ensuring that information\non every public welfare work is easily available to all citizens.\nQuestions\n1.

Why has it then\nbecome a hot issue? A common complaint is lack of dedication to the underlying values of\npublic service and the interests of the citizens served. A common response seems to be the\nattempt to promote a certain kind of leadership. Leadership is a critical component of good\npublic governance. Governance can be briefly described as how a nation\u2019s tacit values (usually\narticulated in some way in its Constitution) are \u2018institutionalised\u2019. This has formal aspects\nsuch as separated powers, checks and balances, means of transferring power, transparency,\nand accountability. However, for these values to be actualised, they must guide the actions\nof public officials throughout the system. They must be imbedded in culture.1\nLeadership is the constitution\u2019s core. It is at the heart of good governance. The most\nimportant role of public sector leaders has been to solve the problems and challenges faced\nin a specific environment. When we say we want more leadership in the public sector, what\nwe are really looking for is people who will promote institutional adaptations in the public\ninterest. Leadership in this sense is not value neutral. It is a positive espousal of the need\nto promote certain fundamental values that can be called public spiritedness.\nLeadership is an important and crucial variable that leads to enhanced management\ncapacity, as well as organisational performance. A leadership focus also plays an integrating\nrole among various Human Resource Management components including recruitment and\nselection, training and development, performance management, public service ethics, and\nsuccession planning.2\nEnvironment of contemporary public administration\nOne of the characteristics of public administration is that it is aimed at the future that is\nactions to be taken in the future. One certain feature of the future trend of events is that public\ninstitutions will continue to grow all over the world. The more highly developed countries\nwill expand their existing services, particularly those concerned with education, highways,\nhousing, public health, physical, social and economic planning, and urban development,\nand will embark on new tasks such as those mentioned above. The low-income countries\nare fully aware that the ambitious plans of economic and social development which they\nhave drawn up, and are pledged to carry out, can only be realised with an efficient system\nof public administration.3\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n74 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nInsight: General and common trends in developing future leaders\nThere is no single best model for developing future leaders, because each country has its\nunique public sector values to be emphasised and the management systems are different\nfrom country to country.\nDespite the diversity of strategies and approaches adopted by OECD Member countries,\nsome general and common trends in developing future leaders can be drawn from the\ncountry experiences.4\nDefine a competence profile for future leaders\nIn the UK and the US, the first step taken to develop future leaders was to define the\ncompetence profile for future leaders. The idea underlying this is that competencies required\nfor future leaders could be different from those required for present leaders in terms of their\nresponsibility, capability, and role.\nFor this reason, it is essential to predict what forms the future public sector will take, and what\nchallenges will be faced to identify and develop leaders suitable for the future environment.\nIdentify and select potential leaders\nGiven the competence framework for future leaders, the next step is often to identify and\nselect potential future leaders. This issue involves the choice of whether to select future\nleaders from outside or to nurture them in the public sector. If a country puts more emphasis\non the former method rather than the latter, it should also discuss the question of how to\nrecruit \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d candidates in competing with other sectors.\nUrge mentoring and training\nOnce potential leaders are identified and selected, the next step is to train them continuously.\nFor this purpose, some countries set up a specialised institution for leadership development.\nOthers put greater emphasis on leadership in existing curricula and establish new training\ncourses for the top executives or senior managers.\nKeep leadership development sustainable\nAs developing future leaders takes a long time, it is very important to keep the leadership\ndevelopment sustainable. To do so, developing a comprehensive programme from the\nwhole-of-government perspective is essential for developing future leaders. Allocating more\nof managers\u2019 time to developing leaders, and linking incentives with performance for better\nleadership are crucial to the success of leadership development programmes.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n75 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nCritical leadership competencies for public managers\nTransforming and directing the energies of others into purposive action requires the right\nknowledge and information, skills, abilities and attitude. For that matter, effective leadership\nrequires a balanced combination of job related attributes and personal qualities.5\nThe following comprise the competencies that are most commonly cited in the literature\nas being core to effective leadership:\nAbility to inspire a shared vision\nThis must be attained by sharing the vision among management, employees and the\nstakeholders involved. Sharing a vision increases acceptability of leaders.\nStrategic thinking\nThinking should be well-focused and directed. It should encompass both short and long-\nterm needs of managers. There must be a sound knowledge of trends likely to impact on\nthe public sector.\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTThhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssss eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-----------------------bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooookkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssss mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttttttttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\nPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF cccccccccccccccccccccccooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmpppppppppppppppppppppppooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnntttttttttttttttttttttttsssssssssssssssssssssss fffffffffffffffffffffffooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP dddddddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssssssssssssss\nwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.......................ssssssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttttttttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigggggggggggggggggggggggnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.......................cccccccccccccccccccccccooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n7766 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nCustomer focus\nOne of the key requirements of effective leadership is that is customer-focused. All services\nshould be geared towards meeting the needs of the customers in the most appropriate and\nsatisfactory manner.\nDecision-making\nDecision-making is a key characteristic of excellent leadership in the public service comes\nfrom decision-making. Leaders must be accountable for the decision that they make but\nalso aim at making the most satisficing decision for the benefit of their organisation.\nDeveloping organisational talent\nThis is an aspect of talent management with the intention of harnessing the potential of\nemployees and ensuring that the best capabilities are being developed. Evidently, talent is\ndeveloped through appropriate training.\nDelegation and empowerment\nLeaders must have the ability to delegate power to their subordinates. Such empowerment\nfavours decision-making at the departmental level but removes inflexibility caused by top-\ndown directives.\nCreating and leading teams\nThe development of teams could be a useful aspect to consider as teams are small groups\nwith leaders aiming at developing new ideas but also working through structured and healthy\ncompetition among themselves.\nLeading by example\nLeaders in the public service have to show this competence of being inspirational in taking\ndecisions that benefit the workplace. This requires a good management of personal and\nleadership ethics.\nPersonal strength and maturity\nPublic leaders must show maturity and strength in their decisions. They must show unity of\ncommand and direction as leaders. They must equally make decisions that show a certain\ndegree of maturity.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n77 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nEffective communication\nPublic leaders are expected to inspire by communication. This can be an essential component\nof public sector management where poor communication causes dysfunctional management\nwith ideas being poorly received and interpreted and lots of misunderstandings taking place.\nResilience\nA characteristic of good leadership requires leaders to be resilient in that they have to accept\ncriticism, very often bear the consequences of employee frustration and demonstration, but\ncertainly, have the ability to \u2018jump back\u2019 again and do their business as usual.\nInnovation/creativity\nPublic leaders are expected to demonstrate a high level of creativity in their endeavours.\nThis allows them make good decisions, improvise whenever applicable and come forward\nwith bright ideas for their organisations.\nTransparency and accountability\nThese are two terms interchangeably used while they stress the importance for leaders to\nabide by high ethical standards. It is very important today for leaders to show this degree\nof accountability in the actions that they undertake.\nSound technical knowledge\nApart from strategic management knowledge, leaders have to show that they have the desired\ntechnical competences to undertake their activities correctly. Knowledge and possession of\ntechnical competences like sciences, economics, and statistics can help leaders discuss issues\nmore confidently.\nAbility to mentor others\nIn line with delegation and empowerment, leaders must demonstrate the ability to mentor\nothers, especially, the younger generation and consider this attitude as a means of sharing\ncompetences but also developing future leaders.\nTop leaders in the public service require the above competencies for a variety of reasons.\nOrganisational or departmental teams must be directed towards a vision of the future in\nan inspirational manner; strategic goals must be found and communicated to all categories\nof public employees; organisational opportunities and constraints must be identified and\nappropriate responses developed, proper judgement must be applied in decision-making;\nand, once made, decisions must be implemented.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n78 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nInsight: Public Sector Leaders: Different Challenges, Different Competencies6\nToday\u2019s public sector leaders are being asked to function with fewer resources and continually\nfind new ways to tackle challenges. Leadership in the public sector is especially important;\nit not only influences the job performance and satisfaction of employees, but also how\ngovernment and public agencies perform. Leadership is critical to good public governance,\nincluding good planning, efficiency, transparency, and accountability.\nPublic sector leaders also face different challenges than in the private sector, and perhaps\ncall on different competencies. Public sector senior leaders are typically prone to follow and\nmonitor rules and procedures and give clear directions about the way things need to be done.\nWithout many of the incentives available in the private sector, it can be a challenge for\npublic sector senior leaders to motivate their employees. What\u2019s more, they may struggle\nwith how to establish a positive working atmosphere that inspires people to deliver good\npublic services.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n7799 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nThe Hudson study also found public sector leaders are more focused on long-term strategy\nand the creative process involved in building a vision. These are important aspects of mindful\nbehaviour, which is considered effective leadership behaviour. The study found that public\nsector senior leaders are more oriented toward strategic leadership, one of the important\naspects of leadership behaviour. And because the public sector presents unique conditions\nand challenges, it is crucial to identify employees who possess these important traits.\nOnce potential leaders are identified, they need to be nurtured. This includes formal and\ninformal mentoring and training. For example, high-potential employees could be paired with\nsenior employees for mentorship and coaching. Daily work also offers many opportunities\nto introduce employees to leadership situations. This could include making a presentation\nto management or heading up a team.\nThrough performance management, managers and staff members can discuss the employee\u2019s\nskills and lay out goals to put them on track for more senior roles. Formal training programmes\ninvolve future leaders learning skills and gaining knowledge in teamwork, managing conflict\nand organisational change, diversity and communication.\nLeadership in any organisation is important, but developing good leaders in the public\nsector is especially crucial.\nA vision for effective leadership\nLeadership has some important common features across all sectors, but must also be adapted\nto the distinctive context of public services. The public sector itself is highly diverse in\ncharacter, governance and size. Its boundaries have changed in recent years and will change\nagain, and the concept of public service extends beyond the public sector. Nonetheless,\nsome features of the public sector clearly distinguish it from the private sector: the political\ncontext, funding arrangements and accountabilities; the lack of market competition; the\npressure to collaborate horizontally; and the distinctive ethos of public services.\nA vision for effective leadership needs to reflect these features. It also needs to recognise:7\n- personal characteristics that are not based solely around magnetism or charisma but\nalso around the ability to motivate and bring the best out of others.\n- organisational skills that recognise the complexity of contemporary organisations\nand focus on defining and communicating mission and strategy rather than\nissuing commands.\n- the ability to work.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n80 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nReshaping the organisational culture of public institutions\nThis is the time when we can have a rebirth in leadership and seize the opportunity to\nreform management practices in our public institutions. What does it mean to manage in\ngovernment? Is that different from leading, and if so, what is that difference? Can managers\nbe leaders? It is time to rethink management and leadership in the public sector.\nWith public trust in government at a low ebb and agencies struggling to do more with\nless, there has never been a greater need for leadership at all levels of government. We\nneed a new paradigm for rethinking government management, one that can generate and\nempower new leaders at all levels and inspire a new generation of professionals to a calling\nin public service.8\nTraditionally, government has been about hierarchy and structure, process and procedures,\nand order and discipline. The challenge facing government is that it has little choice but to\ncapture many of the lessons being learned by innovative private-sector organisations about\nadapting to a rapidly changing world. The question is how.\nThe figure shows a transition where, as the government organisational model transitions\nfrom a top-down approach to a team-based approach \u2013 with empowerment, agility, and\nstakeholder engagement \u2013 the emphasis on leadership versus traditional management is on\nthe rise.\nCase Study: The changing role of public sector leadership9\nThe role of contemporary governments in Africa is very complex, especially with current\nissues of global interdependence, the communications and information technology revolution\nand the expectations of the public to be more involved in the decisions that affect their\nlives. With the advent of the Internet and open government, we need to acknowledge that\nthe days of policy making behind closed doors might well be numbered.\nAs the support of government, the public service should work towards ensuring an effective\nadministrative framework that delivers goods and services efficiently, maintains security, law\nand order and ensures access, fairness and justice \u2013 all of which are critical to a government\nthat governs in a balanced manner. Hence the leadership function in the public service is\ncrucial, while being well informed and able to deal with complex social problems it must\nrecognise that, in the future, technology will have a profound impact on governance; that\nsocieties and the organised entities in them must be characterised by the learning mode;\nand that human resources rejuvenation is the key to renewal of the public sector.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n81 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nDespite huge strides in socio-economic development, leaders must be ready to continue to\ndiscuss fundamental public policy issues of poverty, education, housing, security and health\nas these will continue to dominate the public agenda. More importantly they will have\nto grapple with the dilemma of how governments can remain credible and focused when\nsignificant resources are not in their control or are assigned to organisations with limited\nability to carry them through and lack accountability to the government. Leadership through\ngood governance must be able to manage diversity, identify and develop key strategic areas,\nseek and nurture productive partnerships and focus on outputs as well as outcomes. The\nkey leadership role would thus be to seek ways to build institutional, human resources and\ntechnological capacity to support governance.\nThe public sector leadership should equally measure up to the requirements of a quality culture\nin African organisations, a culture that gradually moves out of its traditional boundaries and\ntranscends them to embrace compelling shifts in structure and content that discuss issues\nsuch as strategic vision and strategic planning, reengineering organisations by leading change,\nmanaging knowledge, internalizing quality, entering the digital age, building partnerships,\nmanaging for accountability and getting values and ethics right.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n8822 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nPublic sector leadership should respond to the real and daunting challenges facing African\ngovernments and enhance their capacity to deal with them. The key factor here is to\ndifferentiate between leading and managing. Leaders in the public service need to be\nconstantly reminded of the need to go beyond management. In the words of Warren Bennis\n\u2018management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.\u2019 Effectiveness is\nwhat should be sought in programmes undertaken in the public service, or for that matter\nin any other field of work.\nEffectiveness is very much a function of leadership, for effectiveness is not so much about\nthe effort that went into carrying out a plan of action; rather it is whether the effort went\ninto an action plan that is headed in the right direction in the first place. This kind of\nmetamorphosis that is from management to leadership is going to have to deal with the\nintrinsic or personal elements of the individual leader. That is why it is equally critical to\npay far more attention to the personal attributes of leaders in hoping to achieve what we\nwant the public service to achieve as a whole.\nSource: Elsir Mahgoub Ali, T (2007) The Role of Public Sector Leadership in Fostering\nSocio-Economic and Political Development in Africa, Ministry of Labour and Administrative\nReform, Sudan.\nQuestions\n1. How is governance linked to effective leadership in the public sector?\n2. How might leadership, through good governance, be able to manage diversity,\nidentify and develop key strategic areas of public administration?\n3. Why is effectiveness a key function of leadership?\nTransactional and Transformational leadership\nTransactional leaders treat leadership as an exchange that is a transaction-relationship between\nthemselves and their employees. In essence, they are saying, I will look after your interests\nif you will look after mine. Transactional leaders believe that employees are motivated by\nreward or punishment. These leaders give clear instructions to followers about what their\nexpectations are and when those expectations are fulfilled, there are rewards in store for\nthem and failure is severely punished.10\nTransactional leadership is not a bad form of leadership, per se. In fact, it is part of the\nskill set needed of any effective leader. Transactional leadership, however, is not sufficient\nwhen it comes to creating significant change in an organisation or inspiring followers to\nachieve at higher levels. What is needed in these instances is transformational leadership.11\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n83 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nTransformational leadership is unambiguously expected to decrease bullying, because\ntransformational leaders strive to create an environment of trust, admiration, loyalty and\nrespect, and they are also involved in the work process and focus on helping succeed\neach worker.12\nTransformational leadership is about building relationships among people and creating real,\nsignificant change by emphasising values and creating a shared vision among those in the\norganisation. Transformational leaders generally rise during times of turmoil and change in\nan organisation. The first priority of a transformational leader is to identify and understand\nthe needs of the people in the organisation and then elevate those needs. By focusing on\ntheir requirements, the transformational leader motivates people to achieve at higher levels\nand to produce the type of work they did not think they could. This increases the employees\u2019\nbeliefs in themselves and their abilities.13\nTransformational Leadership\u2019s four elements14\nIdealised influence\nIdealised influence designates leaders seen as role-models by followers. They are admired,\nrespected, and trusted. They inspire power and pride in their followers, by going beyond\ntheir own individual interests and focusing on the interests of the group and of its members.\nInspirational Motivation\nInspirational Motivation refers to the capacity of the leader to articulate in simple ways the\ngoals and objectives of the group or organisation. It also refers to the capacity to create a\nmutual understanding of what is right and what is wrong. Transformational leaders provide\nvisions of what is possible and how to attain it. They enhance meaning and promote positive\nexpectations about what needs to be done.\nIntellectual Stimulation\nIntellectual Stimulation is linked to creativity and innovation. Through intellectual stimulation,\ntransformational leaders help followers view problems in new ways. They encourage followers\nto question their own beliefs, assumptions, and values, and, when appropriate, those of the\nleader, which may be outdated or inappropriate for solving current problems.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n84 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor leadershiP\nIndividualised Consideration\nIndividualised Consideration means the leader is responding to each person\u2019s specific needs\nto include everybody in the \u2018transformation\u2019 process (Simic, 1998). Followers are developed\nto successively higher levels of potential. The transformational leader treats each member of\nthe group as a unique person with specific needs, abilities and knowledge.15\nWomen\u2019s participation in economic and public life\nWomen\u2019s participation in economic and public life strengthens economic growth, equitable\ngovernance and public trust, from the community level to top policymaking circles. Equal\naccess of both men and women to economic opportunities, in both the public and private\nsectors, contributes to a more equitable, sustainable economy.

An abundance of\ntheories and approaches were developed to explain the nature of employee motivation.\nAnother handful of studies were conducted in an attempt to discover whether public sector\nemployees have different motivation antecedents than their private sector counterparts. And\na special motivation theory, called Public Service Motivation (PSM), was conceptualised\nto explain how public employees differ from private workers in the level and type of their\nintrinsic desire to work and serve.1\nImproving management functions and procedures of human resources in the public sector\nis a continuous and constantly evolving process. From the public officials the citizens and\nsociety require effective work in providing public services to the population. In comparison\nwith the private sector, a lower efficiency in public sector is still noticeable in the world. The\nefficiency of state and municipal authorities depends not only on the education, competence\nand abilities of public officials. The efficiency of human resources motivation system has a\nsignificant impact on the effectiveness of state and municipal authorities.

It is closely\nassociated with the idea of public service ethos, which is rooted in an understanding that\nthe public service is different from the private sector, both because of the tasks it performs\nand the behaviours it expects of its employees. Public service motivation is not the only\nor even the most important criterion of people choosing to take up, or remain in, public\nservice employment. Recent research cites the superseding importance of good, or at least\nmarket-rate, levels of pay and security of tenure. The prevailing economic situation in the\ncountry and longstanding cultural issues which impact on the prestige and social standing\nof public officials are likewise relevant.3\nHowever, public service motivation does matter, and among the intrinsic reasons that come\ninto play when people chose where to work it is highly significant. Against a backdrop of\nglobal recession, many governments are increasingly seeking to reform their public service,\nreducing cost and increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services. These\nchanges are needed.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n9911 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nResearch is cautious against ignoring or minimising the negative impact on employee\nmotivation and engagement of changes to terms and conditions and ways of working. In\ncircumstances where extrinsic motivations are significantly constrained or even reduced, as\nis the case currently in the Irish public service, it is critical that managers are very aware of\nthe importance of fostering and supporting the intrinsic motivations of employees.\nMotivational theories\nTo grasp concepts of public sector motivation, it might be useful for learners to get an\noverview of the general motivation theories and think of their relevance and adaptability\nto public administration. A summary from Your Coach website allows us grasp the key\nconcepts of motivation without going into much detail.4\nNeeds motivation theories\nAccording to needs theories of motivation, motivation is \u2018the willingness to exert high levels\nof effort toward organisational goals, conditioned by the effort\u2019s ability to satisfy some\nindividual need\u2019.\nA need in this context is an internal state that makes certain outcomes appear attractive.\nAn unsatisfied need creates tension that drives the person. These drives then generate a\nsearch behaviour to find particular goals that, if attained, will satisfy the need and lead to\nthe reduction of the tension.\nNeeds are physiological or psychological deficiencies that arouse behaviour. These vary over\ntime and place, as the can be strong or weak and influenced by environmental factors.\nEquity theory\nJohn Stacey Adams\u2019 equity theory helps explain why pay and conditions alone do notdetermine\nmotivation. It also explains why giving one person a promotion or pay rise can have a\ndemotivating effect on others.\nWhen people feel fairly or advantageously treated they are more likely to be motivated; when\nthey feel unfairly treated they are highly prone to feelings of disaffection and demotivation.\nEmployees seek to maintain equity between the inputs that they bring to a job and the\noutcomes that they receive from it against the perceived inputs and outcomes of others. The\nbelief in equity theory is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be motivated\nto keep the fairness maintained in the relationships of their co-workers and the organisation.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n92 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nAlderfer\u2019s ERG motivation theory\nClayton P. Alderfer\u2019s ERG theory from 1969 condenses Maslow\u2019s five human needs into\nthree categories: Existence, Relatedness and Growth.\nExistence Needs\nInclude all material and physiological desires (such as food, water, air, clothing, safety,\nphysical love and affection). Maslow\u2019s first two levels.\nRelatedness Needs\nEncompass social and external esteem; relationships with significant others like family,\nfriends, co-workers and employers. This also means to be recognised and feel secure as part\nof a group or family. Maslow\u2019s third and fourth levels.\nGrowth Needs\nInternal esteem and self-actualisation; these impel a person to make creative or productive\neffects on herself and the environment (for instance, to progress toward one\u2019s ideal self).\nMaslow\u2019s fourth and fifth levels. This includes desires to be creative and productive, and to\ncomplete meaningful tasks.\nVroom Expectancy Motivation theory\nWhereas Maslow and Herzberg look at the relationship between internal needs and the\nresulting effort expended to fulfil them, Vroom\u2019s expectancy theory separates effort (which\narises from motivation), performance, and outcomes.\nVroom\u2019s expectancy theory assumes that behaviour results from conscious choices among\nalternatives whose purpose it is to maximise pleasure and to minimise pain. Vroom realised\nthat an employee\u2019s performance is based on individual factors such as personality, skills,\nknowledge, experience and abilities. He stated effort and are linked in a person\u2019s motivation.\nHe uses the variables Expectancy, Instrumentality, and Valence to account for this.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n93 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nCase Study: Motivation of Public Service Officials5\nWhile public services are constrained in their ability to compete for top talent, it may not\nactually be in their best strategic, long-term interests to compete.

It is these positive attributes that\nenergise, direct and sustain the relevant behaviour. People are motivated by many different\nconsiderations to work for and in government. The public sector has traditionally offered\nsome strong extrinsic motivators that might attract people, such as security of tenure, career\nand development opportunities and the pension system.6\nVandenabeele (2008) has also identified \u2018quality of life\u2019 as an attraction of public sector\nwork, with people having the impression that the public sector affords better flexibilities\nfor those combining work with family or other commitments.7 However, these extrinsic or\nrational considerations, which might lead a person to seek public sector employment lie\noutside what is widely understood by the terms \u2018public service motivation\u2019 (PSM). Rather\nPSM relates only to the notion that \u2018people are oriented to act in the public domain for\nthe purpose of doing good for others and society\u2019.\nMeasuring public service motivation\nMuch of the early research on public service motivation focused on establishing the existence\nof public service motivation by showing that public sector employees value intrinsic rewards\nmore, and extrinsic rewards less, than their private sector counterparts (Wright, 2008).8 Public\nservice motivation was seen to be only connected to altruistic motives. Consequently, the level\nand type of a person\u2019s public service motivation, and other research propositions such as the\nprevalence of public service motivation and its impact on performance remained unanswered.\nInitial steps to develop a public service motivation scale that could be used for research\nwere made by Perry (1996).9\nThe twenty-four item scale is divided across a range of distinct dimensions or reasons why\npeople are attracted to public service work (Perry, 1996; Wright, 1998). A few dimensions\nare mentioned below.\nPublic policy making\u2019s attraction\nFrom a rational or individual utility maximisation perspective, it is suggested that people are\nattracted to public policy making as a way of maximising their own need for power, sense of\nimportance or as a way of advocating a special interest that would provide personal benefits.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n96 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nDesire to serve public interest\nIn other words, having a sense of obligation to society. As people work for the government,\nthe implicit intention is that they are contributing something to society. A teacher, for\ninstance, sells his expert teaching and knowledge to train students to become learned. In\nthe same way, a doctor\u2019s responsibility is to save lives while working for the State.\nCompassion or self-sacrifice\nDimensions that represent service as an emotional response to humankind. This is somewhat\ndifficult to interpret as people might be attracted to money in the public service. There\nmight also be the relevance of self-sacrifice as giving oneself to a job for the benefit of\nsociety. This might come from long hours of research that is publicly funded but of great\nuse to society with perhaps some self-satisfaction to the researcher.\nAccording to Wright (2008) Perry\u2019s contribution was significant as it provided \u2018a more\ncomprehensive and theory-based conceptualisation of public service motivation than earlier\napproaches which only recognised altruistic motives for public service while ignoring the\npossibility that self-interested or rational motives might also exist.\u2019\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n9977 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nPractising public service motivation\nThe table below provides both a strategy and tactics-oriented perspective in understanding\nhow public service motivation concepts could be applied.

(2008). From Theory to Practice: Strategies for Applying\nPublic Service Motivation, Oxford University Press.10\nGovernment\u2019s appeal for employee motivation\nMost governments call for employee motivation. In difficult times, government may be\nwilling to emphasise sacrifice and commitment from employees. A slogan like \u2018The call too\nwork and sacrifice\u2019 is commonly heard during the reading of the budget speech or a talk\nto employees.11\nSuch a situation presses employees to become wearier and more cautious. At this stage, it\nmay be correct to accept that employee motivation reaches the lowest level. Motivation is\ntherefore difficult to assess in the public sector even if government claims that the general\nmood of the nation is good.\nEvidently, money is not a motivator as motivation theory suggests that it only reduces\ndissatisfaction. The real motivator should be work. At work, employees want to be recognised\nfor their contribution and like to feel responsible for what they do.\nIt is worth noting that the level of commitment and motivation can dissipate over the years.\nWhen employees feel that the nature of their job keeps them stagnant, their motivation\nlevel declines. Younger employees may show more enthusiasm if they get a decent job with\nstatus and sound remuneration.\nInsight: Why public officers are harder to motivate?12\nIn these highly-visible environments, managers need government workforces to be highly\nengaged if they are to succeed. This requires that public sector leaders understand and discuss\nfactors that make increasing engagement in the public sector a special challenge. Here are\nseven factors that make motivating government employees difficult, plus one factor that is\nan advantage \u2013 and how managers can discuss them.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n99 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nPrevailing negative attitudes about government and government employees\nCritics of government, including politicians and some media, portray public sector employees\nas overpaid and underworked. Understandably, these images hurt employee morale and\nengagement. One approach to mitigating this situation is to show public employees that\ntheir agencies are working to educate the public about what they do and how it affects the\npublic\u2019s wellbeing. This can be done through press releases, public forums, websites, social\nmedia, and even outreach to schools. Managers can make employees aware, too, of how\nmuch power they have to shift public opinion.\nHard-to-measure achievement\nFew things are more engaging than making important progress toward goals, but the goals\nof public-sector organisations are often hard to translate into objectively measurable units.\nGovernment managers must therefore clearly articulate long-term missions, values, goals,\nand impacts \u2013 and help employees see how their work connects. As one local government\npublic servant put it: \u2018When I found myself getting down, I would head to the front lines.\nBeing among the citizens we served reminded me why I was there and why it was important\nto keep fighting.\u2019\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n110000 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nAn older workforce\nThe government workforce is more educated and more white-collar than the private-sector\nworkforce. It is also older. Government managers can leverage the upside and minimise the\ndownside of these demographics by emphasising the kind of engagement that comes with\napplying long experience to solving critical problems. Managers can also maintain vitality\nin their groups by openly discussing retirement and helping older employees ease gracefully\ninto the next phase of their lives. At the other end of the employee life cycle, it is crucial\nto recruit highly motivated new people to replace the departing baby boomers.\nConstraints on the use of financial incentives\nGovernment agencies usually can\u2019t provide performance incentives like large pay raises and\nbonuses; or perks like stock options, fitness centre club memberships, and car services.\nFaced with limited ways to reward and recognize performance, government managers need\nto focus on agency mission and impact, and also provide nonfinancial recognition. This\nincludes adopting workplace flexibility practices, and providing non-financial recognition\nthat sometimes means simply saying \u201cthank you\u201d and praising good performance.\nPublic visibility of government\nThe work of government is uniquely visible, due to open meetings/records laws that require\nagencies to meet in public and also provide, on request, meetings minutes, memos, decision\ndocuments, emails, and even text messages. This transparency means that public-sector\nmanagers committed to improving engagement need to help employees feel safe and secure,\nallowing them to feel comfortable voicing opinions, taking risks, and innovating.\nDifferent employee motivations\nResearch has shown that public servants find meaning in their work by making a positive\ndifference in the lives of the citizens they serve. This is an advantage in building engagement.\nMany employees enter public service because they are already committed to the mission of\ngovernment. Agencies need to find, aggressively recruit, and then hire job candidates who are\nmotivated by public service. Managers must then leverage public-service motivation by involving\nemployees in decisions and helping them see and appreciate their individual contributions.\nPoints\nImproving management functions and procedures of human resources in public sector is a\ncontinuous and constantly evolving process.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n101 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT motivation in the PubliC seCtor\nAccording to needs theories of motivation, motivation is \u2018the willingness to exert high levels\nof effort toward organisational goals, conditioned by the effort\u2019s ability to satisfy some\nindividual need\u2019.\nThe belief in equity theory is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be\nmotivated to keep the fairness maintained in the relationships of their co-workers and the\norganisation.\nAlderfer\u2019s ERG theory condenses Maslow\u2019s five human needs into three\ncategories: Existence, Relatedness and Growth.\nVroom\u2019s expectancy theory assumes that effort, performance and motivation are linked in\na person\u2019s motivation.\nPrivate and public sector workers differ in their intrinsic motivation to serve. In a study\nof, it was found that employees working in the public sector are attracted because of the\nintrinsic rewards and are more likely to be committed to their organisation.\nA few dimensions of measuring public motivation are: attraction to public policy making,\na desire to serve the public interest, and Compassion and self-sacrifice.\nA few factors that make motivating government employees difficult are: hard-to-measure\nachievement, an older workforce, public visibility of government, constraints on the use of\nfinancial incentives.\nQuestions\n1.

Joining an organisation at a\nrelatively young age, progressing during his career and ultimately attaining the top level are\nillustrations are changes taking place in the life of the public officer. While these changes\nare unavoidable and broadly unquestionable, changes at work might be issues where the\nemployee finds himself in conflict with what she is actually doing and what might be\nexpected of him in the future.\nChange is a necessity for most organisations and the public sector is not exempt from it. It\nhas been seen that public organisations are now espousing change more quickly than ever\nbefore because of the impact of internal and external factors. The need to downsize can be\nan external factor for change, the need to abide by new technology at work could be an\ninternal factor for change.\nAlthough change is essential, it may have some effect on the worker. For instance, an\nelder public officer might consider change to be a threat to him while this might be better\nespoused by a younger worker. The fear of the unknown, the threat of being surpassed by\nothers and the apprehension that existing privileges might be lost could be some compelling\nforces that might undermine change.\nThis chapter starts by defining change and moves forward with an explanation of factors\ninfluencing public sector change and ways on how to bring about change in the most\nacceptable way.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n105 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nDefining Change management\nChange management is the discipline that guides how companies prepare, equip and support\npeople to successfully adopt change to drive organisational success and outcomes.\nWhile each change and person is unique, decades of research show there are actions we\ncan take to influence people in their individual transitions. Change management provides\na structured approach for supporting people in any organisation to move from their own\ncurrent states to their own future states.\nChange management\u2019s Three Levels: Individual, Organisational, and Enterprise\nWhile it is the natural psychological and physiological reaction of humans to resist change,\nwe are actually quite resilient creatures. When supported through times of change, we can\nbe wonderfully adaptive and successful.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n110066 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nIndividual change management\nIndividual change management requires understanding how people experience change and\nwhat they need to change successfully. It also requires knowing what will help people make\na successful transition: what messages do people need to hear when and from whom, when\nthe optimal time to teach someone a new skill is, how to coach people to demonstrate\nnew behaviours, and what makes changes \u2018stick\u2019 in someone\u2019s work. Individual change\nmanagement draws on disciplines like psychology and neuroscience to apply actionable\nframeworks to individual change.1\nOrganisational Change Management\nWhile change happens at the individual level, it is often impossible for a project team to\nmanage change on a person-by-person basis. Organisational or initiative change management\nprovides us with the steps and actions to take at the project level to support the hundreds\nor thousands of people whom a project impacts.\nOrganisational change management involves first identifying the groups and people who\nwill need to change as the result of the project, and in what ways they will need to change.\nOrganisational change management then involves creating a customised plan for ensuring\nimpacted employees receive the awareness, leadership, coaching, and training they need to\nchange successfully. Driving successful individual transitions should be the central focus of\nthe activities in organisational change management.\nOrganisational change management is complementary to your project management. Project\nmanagement ensures your project\u2019s solution is designed, developed and delivered, while\nchange management ensures your project\u2019s solution is embraced, adopted and used.\nEnterprise change management capability\nEnterprise change management is an organisational core competency that provides competitive\ndifferentiation and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing world. An enterprise change\nmanagement capability means effective change management is embedded into your\norganisation\u2019s roles, structures, processes, projects and leadership competencies. Change\nmanagement processes are consistently applied to initiatives, leaders have the skills to guide\ntheir teams through change, and employees know what to ask for to be successful.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n107 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nThe end result of an enterprise change management capability is that people embrace change\nmore quickly, and organisations are able to respond quickly to market changes, embrace\nstrategic initiatives, and adopt new technology more quickly and with less productivity impact.\nThis capability does not happen by chance, however, and requires a strategic approach to\nembed change management across an organisation.2\nChange and public service\nOrganisational change is a reality of the 21st century. The forces for change are largely\nexternal, coming from increased demands brought by customers, competitors, suppliers,\nmarkets, government regulations and the advent of new technologies. Acquisitions and\ndownsizings pose additional significant demands.\nThere are also common internal motivators such as: dissatisfaction with current performance\nwhen compared to established goals; the need to implement and gain the full benefit of new\ntechnologies; the increasing expectations of key people, especially senior management; new\ndemands from the workforce, for example, for more influence, information, and increased\nskills; and, finally, the force of shared values that guide the organisation\u2019s desired relationships\nwith customers, employees, and the community.\nThese issues are no less compelling for those who labour in government departments and\nroles. They are facing demands to \u2018industrialise\u2019 so as to become \u2018lean and mean.\u2019 These\ndemands come from taxpayers, government officials and others who are horrified with\nthe waste and poor service record that have been identified in all manner of government\nprocesses over many years.3\nNeed for public sector change\nToday\u2019s world is highly competitive and demanding. Society is better informed and expects\nmore from public and private organisations alike. Traditional public processes and institutions\nare less effective in satisfying people\u2019s needs. Globalisation, the wide use of communication\nand information technologies, and the coming of the knowledge society, among other factors,\nare rapidly changing the world\u2019s order. This has created new challenges to nation-states as\npeople\u2019s expectations from government have increased, job seekers are more demanding on\njob content, and societies call for more investment in education, health, and society but\nare unwilling to pay more taxes.4\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n108 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nPersonnel systems are becoming less adaptive to these new challenges. Traditional practices\nin public administration are the product of a different context with different priorities. Now,\ngovernments have a new role in society and are taking on new responsibilities but generally\nwithout tools to manage them. Public managers are expected to improve the performance\nof their organisations focusing on efficiency, effectiveness, and propriety which were not the\npriorities 50 years ago. Therefore, to respond to a changing environment, the public sector\nhas to transform its structures, processes, procedures, and above all, its culture.\nPublic sector change and reform\nChange and reform are two concepts commonly used in political and academic discourse.\nIn politics, for instance, policy-making is described as a change-oriented activity aimed at\ntransforming, modifying or altering the status quo. The notions of change and reform are\nused interchangeably but that, however, is not necessarily always appropriate. Reform is only\none way of producing change; it implies a special approach to problem solving. Sometimes\nchanges in organisations are part of any reform and some reforms produce little or no change\nat all. Whereas change as transformation or alteration may be an intended or unintended\nphenomenon, reform is a structured and conscious process of producing change no matter\nits extent. Reforms can occur in political, economic, social and administrative domains and\ncontain ideas about problems and solutions.5\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n110099 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nInternal sources of change\nCitizens\u2019 dissatisfaction, diminished trust in government and public participation in\npolicymaking constitute a trigger force for change in government. The ability to manage\nchange is determined, to a large extent, by the inclusion or exclusion of public participation\nin the definition of the reform agenda. Although an inclusive policy-making process\ndemands more consultation and negotiation, it certainly encourages support for the reform\ninitiative, particularly for long-term solutions, legitimises the entire process of policy-making,\nstrengthens commitment from all stakeholders to the reform, and accelerates the acceptance\nand management of change.\nFor instance, Waugh (2002) argues that \u2018direct public participation in policy deliberations\non environmental risk increases both the likelihood that the policy choices will fit local\nneeds and the likelihood that local capacities to address community problems will expand.\u2019\nInternal events such as economic crises, political turmoil, ineffective response to natural\ndisasters, health and sanitary emergencies may also provoke changes at the interior of the\npublic sector to deal with problems better. In such cases, managing change may turn a\ncomplicated issue as the lack of information and awareness, and even mental and emotional\npreparation would hamper the acceptance of change. The introduction of a reform initiative\nposes the problem of adaptation to new circumstances. Incremental reforms, in contrast,\nwould ease the understanding of change and diminish resistance.6\nExternal sources of change\nThe external environment is changing fast and countries have a growing need for adaptations.\nHowever, countries are constrained by a complex interplay of agents from the public and\nprivate sectors at global, international, national and local levels. Constant interaction and\ndependence on resources have led national governments to be part of self-organising and\ninterdependent policy networks. This factor has imposed significant restrictions on countries\u2019\nability to define independently their reform agendas because the introduction of change will\nproduce a reaction from other members of the network as they are interrelated. Failing to\nacknowledge other agents\u2019 interests may result in policy failure and resistance to change.7\nThe transfer of ideas, innovations, and best practices among countries has been facilitated\nby global, international and transnational sources of policy change. The level of dependence\namong members of a policy network determines whether a process of policy transfer is\ncoercive or voluntary and, in doing so, contributing to our understanding of the origins\nof change in government.8\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n110 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nExpected new cultural values of public sector change\nPublic sector reforms are complex, in many cases unpopular, contested, fraught with risk, and\nrequire a long time to produce results and prove their benefits. This fact begs the question\nof how to maintain legitimacy, increase support, sustain the impetus for reform and avoid\ncontinuing losing people\u2019s trust while introducing controversial but needed reform initiatives.\nEffective management of change techniques should contribute to keep up the momentum\nfor reform while overcoming any opposition to change.9\nTraditional Values Instruments of Reform Expected New Cultural Values\nHierarchies of control Citizens empowerment Accountability\nConformity Policy dialogue Openness\nImpersonality of work Normalisation of Transparency\nemployment conditions\nAuthority through position Delegation of authority Efficiency\nEffectiveness\nCommand-control paradigm Performance-oriented focus Authority through leadership\nTrusted leadership Managerial culture\nFactors leading to resisting change\nThere are several factors leading to resistance to change in the public service. These are\ndetailed below.\nLack of coherence of the reform and consistency with other reform initiatives may\nproduce confusion and generate opposition\nReform initiatives may all come along in the government. This can be something affecting\ndifferent ministries including parastatal bodies at a single time. It is important that the\nvarious reforms should have some degree of commonality to ensure that the reform remains\nfocus and people see the change in a more focused manner.\nFear and uncertainty to a new work environment generate opposition to a\nreform initiative\nNew work environments could be impediments to change. For example, shifting to new\noffices and working under different conditions like flexitime could be barriers to ensuring\neffective public sector change since old customs and routine are harder to remove than\naccepting change.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n111 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nNegative implications perceived by people and groups may trigger resisting change\nNegative implications of change are seen in the form of longer working hours, the need to\nlearn and get trained, and getting used to new systems at the workplace including the loss\nof existing privileges. Sometimes viewed as \u2018worse than before\u2019, change becomes difficult\nto espouse.\nStakeholders may oppose a reform initiative\u2019s complexity if leaders and managers\nexplain reasons unclearly\nLeaders need to have the ability to bring transformation among the employees surely through\nadministering change using transformational leadership. If this is not achieved, employees\nperceive such change to be rather \u2018undermined\u2019 than being a real need for the organisation\nand this is where the success of change is threatened.\nImposing change may generate opposition towards the reform initiative\nThe worse problem affecting change is through the imposition of ideas and strategy. If\nchange becomes something mandatory, it will be difficult to reach consensus from public\nofficers and also become very difficult in transmitting the change philosophy down the line.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n111122 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nPeople at an organisation\u2019s different levels may perceive change differently\nAll people in the organisation may not have the same perception of change. Some can\nunderstand the need immediately while others, by virtue of their culture, skill or perception,\nthink that change was unnecessary and that this is rather a position that favours management\nrather than themselves. Such resistance to change might be risky.\nDiminishing human factor\u2019s value in process of change\nThe change process should involve human beings. It depends on the interaction of people to\nchange and how they can negotiate, co-opt and even resist change initially. The psychological\ninvolvement of people in change is useful because this is where the real threats or questions\naffecting workers can be debated openly.\nLack of information and communication may increase uncertainty and distrust\ncausing resistance to change\nOnce again, the need to have a clear line of communication with full explanation of change,\nits consequences, its benefits and certain shortcomings, need to be exposed so that arguments\ncould be debated and the notion of change could be better understood.\nInsight: Change Management Challenges in the Public Sector10\nIn the public sector, these shared issues with the private sector can be exacerbated by budget\nconstraints, rules and regulations, employee morale, accountabilities and, in some cases,\nlack of motivation. Leaders must take the extra steps to include a comprehensive change\nmanagement plan in their Employee Resource Planning (ERP) implementation. In many\ncases, this starts with comprehensive training of the leadership team. Following are five key\nsteps to address potential challenges:\nClearly define implementation goals and objectives\nSpend the time explaining how the ERP implementation fits with mission of the public\nsector entity. One can start with the concept of return on citizenship (ROC). Similar to\nwhat the private sector calls return on investment, ROC is the bedrock of the any public\nsector entity that spends taxpayer dollars to provide a service to their constituents. An ERP\nimplementation is a way to enhance and improve that service. While it sounds obvious,\nROC is often overlooked.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n113 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nProvide comprehensive training for leadership\nComprehensive ERP implementations are not common in the private sector, much less in the\npublic sector. Therefore, it is important to take the time to train and inform leadership and\nproject team about the purpose of the ERP implementation, their roles and responsibilities\nand what to expect throughout the implementation.\nInclude organisational change management\nFrom a research that companies with effective change management and communications\nplans are 3.5 times more likely to outperform industry peers. In the public sector, this\nnumber is even higher. A change management plan includes taking the time to establish\norganisational readiness, conduct business process mapping, prepare workforce transition and\ntraining strategy documents, conduct change agent training, and prepare a change impact\nanalysis. In addition, a communications plan needs to be prepared that includes strategies,\ntactics, target audiences, key messages, timing and activities.\nAcknowledge the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019\nAn ERP implementation will change the way employees perform their jobs. There will\nbe resistance not only from the expected areas but also from unexpected and maybe even\nunknown areas. Be honest about this fact and address the pessimists by having a plan in\nplace.

Many public sector\norganisations seek capacity \u2013 the ability to get things done \u2013 but not change which is a\ndifferent way of doing old and new things. The introduction of increased use of appropriate\nchange management strategies and methods in development cooperation will often be resisted\ndue the difficulty of precise definition of their results and the uncertainty of their outcomes.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n114 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nFor many development practitioners change and capacity are distinct, but the evidence\nsuggests that they are intertwined. Hence, it is important to understand what aspects of\nthe status quo can be changed so that capacity development can take place. Identifying the\nboundaries of change management work is important as is identifying the risks and potential\nmitigation. Moreover, this is needed to manage expectations accordingly.\nDifferent actors in change process have different powers and exert different influences.\nThus, there is a risk that change model may represent \u2018political fix\u2019 \u2013 reflecting the interest\nof the more powerful players \u2013 or a response to donors\u2019 pressure as \u2018external drivers for\nchange\u2019 without a genuine commitment, thus risking failure of the change effort. Change\ninitiatives need to have a powerful guiding coalition and endogenous support, hence the\nimportance of focusing on power relations and dynamics in the institutional landscape, as\nwell as taking a more objective look at the role of donors as either drivers or facilitators of\nchange cannot be overemphasized.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n111155 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nChange models and processes that aim to change the culture of the organization are difficult\nto operationalise, because of the inherent difficulty in uncovering the informal systems that\nguide peoples\u2019 behaviour.

What state has\nnot tried to reform its health-care system, improve its public-transportation network, or\nimplement a major IT programme only to give up after several years of minimal impact\nand ballooning costs? The dispersed accountability of government agencies and the intense\npublic scrutiny given to the public sector combine to make real and lasting reform quite\nchallenging to carry out.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n116 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nBecause of the confluence of several forces, pressure is increasing on governments to\nundertake large-scale reform. The lingering impact of the global financial crisis, a long wave\nof retirements among the baby boom generation, and the new expectations and demands of a\nWeb-connected citizenry are forcing governments to change how they do business \u2013 whether\nby creating new methods of service delivery or significantly cutting costs. On top of this\npressure, the complexity of public problems \u2013 such as achieving stability in global financial\nmarkets \u2013 means that we are asking more of our public servants now than ever before.\nThese challenges can be readily overcome. By focusing on some specific aspects of leadership\nalignment, programme management, and execution, government organisations can substantially\nincrease their odds of success and deliver lasting impact. And this effort can be made\nin addition to the normal course of operations if the leaders of these organisations are\nappropriately supported, allowing them to focus on the issues that are essential to making\nthe desired change happen.12\nAccording to Davis et al (2012), there is a proven approach can mitigate risks and help\ntame the multi-headed beast that major reform represents for a government agency. BCG\u2019s\nexperience with scores of public-sector transformation programs suggests a set of five principles\nto guide the effort and raise the odds of success:\nRecognise good policy is just the start\nPublic leaders should complement good policy with carefully sequenced and rigorous\nimplementation. As such, bringing change to public bodies should not be abrupt and\nunexpected. It should follow a structured mechanism that allows public officers to understand\nthe practicality of change and its benefit to the organisation.\nEngage key stakeholders\nMove key stakeholders beyond entrenched positions by finding points of commonality.\nKeep the process forward-looking\nPublic administrators need to anticipate risks, allow for fast midcourse corrections, and\nensure clarity on emerging progress. There should not be any reason to be discouraged\nwhile implementing reform or change. This should be undertaken in a pro-active manner.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n117 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nFocus leadership on the highest-priority issues\nPublic leaders need to support senior management with a strategic yet light-touch programme\nmanagement office.

It is not a discipline that has more practical\nrelevance in one sector than in another \u2013 the methods and approaches of the discipline are\nbeing applied in business and government alike. Nevertheless, public sector organisations\nare frequently presented as a \u2018special case\u2019 in organisational change research, portraying the\nimpression that bringing about change is significantly more difficult \u2013 and perhaps even\nimpossible \u2013 in government organisations than it is in the private sector.\nThe challenge for public sector organisations is therefore to create an internal culture of\nchange driven from the outside in which enables and requires public servants to innovate\nand implement change. At present, however, in the literature and in practice, one can only\nobserve possible elements of a specific organisational change model for the public sector\nwhich would address this challenge. There are currently no coherent specific organisational\nchange models which are generic to the public sector. Understanding and defining the true\nscope for organisational change interventions in the public sector will therefore depend on\nthe development of specific generic public sector models for organisational change.\nPoints\nChange management is the discipline that guides how companies prepare, equip and support\npeople to successfully adopt change to drive organisational success and outcomes.\nThere are three levels of change management.\nIndividual change management requires understanding how people experience change and\nwhat they need to change successfully.\nOrganisational change management involves first identifying the groups and people who\nwill need to change as the result of the project, and in what ways they will need to change.\nEnterprise change management is an organisational core competency that provides competitive\ndifferentiation and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing world.\nInternal events such as economic crises, political turmoil, ineffective response to natural\ndisasters, health and sanitary emergencies may also provoke changes at the interior of the\npublic sector to deal with problems better.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n119 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT Change management in the PubliC seCtor\nThe transfer of ideas, innovations, and best practices among countries has been facilitated\nby global, international and transnational sources of external change.\nFactors leading to resistance to change in the public service are: Lack of coherence of the\nreform, Fear and uncertainty, Imposition of change and diminishing the importance of the\nhuman factor.\nA practical way to manage change in the public sector is to engage key stakeholders, focus\nleadership on the highest-priority issues, embed change and spread the benefits.\nQuestions\n1.

In most economies, public expenditure\nforms a significant part of gross domestic product (GDP) and public sector entities are\nsubstantial employers and major capital market participants. The public sector determines,\nthrough a political process, the outcomes it wants to achieve and the different types of\nintervention. These include enacting legislation or regulations; delivering goods and services;\nredistributing income through mechanisms such as taxation or social security payments; and\nthe ownership of assets or entities, such as state owned enterprises. Governments also have\na role in promoting fairness, peace and order, and sound international relations.\nEffective governance in the public sector encourages better decision making and the efficient\nuse of resources and strengthens accountability for the stewardship of those resources.\nEffective governance is characterised by robust scrutiny, which provides important pressures\nfor improving public sector performance and tackling corruption. Effective governance can\nimprove management, leading to more effective implementation of the chosen interventions,\nbetter service delivery, and, ultimately, better outcomes. People\u2019s lives are thereby improved.1\nAt its most basic level, governance covers \u2018the management of the course of events in a\nsocial system\u2019, whether such systems are conceived in organisational, sectoral or broader\nterms (Horrigan 2010).2\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n122 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nIn that sense, the governance of systems embraces their structures, internal and external\ninteractions, and modes of decision-making and other behaviour. In this manner, Chhotray\nand Stoker formulate an all-embracing definition of \u2018governance\u2019 as follows (2009: 3):\nGovernance is about the rules of collective decision-making in settings where there are a\nplurality of actors or organisations and where no formal control system can dictate the\nterms of the relationship between these actors and organisations. In short, governance is\nconcerned with how and why systems of all kinds are constituted and operated.3\nThe OECD (1999) principles define corporate governance as:\n\u2018A set of relationships between a company\u2019s management, its board, its shareholders and\nother stakeholders. Corporate governance also provides the structure through which the\nobjectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring\nperformance are determined. Good corporate governance should provide proper incentives\nfor the board and management to pursue objectives that are in the interests of the company\nand shareholders and should facilitate effective monitoring, thereby encouraging firms to\nuse resources more efficiently.\u20194\nGood governance guidelines for public sector agencies5\nEffective agencies focus on achieving good governance through:\nStrategy\nThis involves planning and structures, such as strategic and operational planning, organisational\nstructure and having defined and appropriate roles and responsibilities\nCulture\nThis relates to leadership and integrity, demonstrated in leadership structures and behaviours,\nexecutive oversight of strategic decisions, embodiment of leadership principles, conduct and\nvalues, employee engagement and commitment to service delivery.\nRelations\nThese refer to communication and reputation, shown in internal and external communication and\nrelationships, striving for a reputation for excellence, working across organisational boundaries.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n123 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nPerformance\nThis relates to effectiveness and efficiency, through performance monitoring and evaluation systems\nand process, both at an individual and organisational level, as well as performance reporting.\nCompliance and accountability\nThese involve meeting statutory and other obligations, through audit, delegation of authority,\nand having policies, processes and plans to manage finances, risk, human resources, as well\nas ethical, equal opportunity, occupational health and safety and record keeping obligations.\nInsight: Good governance\u2019s value in managing public affairs6\nA Good Governance Doctrine is one which will help governments, state enterprises and\nthose who run them remain worthy of the trust of their citizens.\nFirst and foremost, there must be sustained and committed leadership that embodies the core\nvalues of good governance. Direction starts at the top. Leadership can make good governance\nbecome a reality. When senior management is committed to transparency, integrity and\naccountability and lives by these standards, it will set the tone for staff.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n112244 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nAll organisations need a soul, a compass to guide them regardless of the pressures or turmoil\nwhich will come their way. Let me suggest a very short list of these values, those that I see\nas essential:\nIntegrity and Probity sit above everything. If everyone in an organisation acts with integrity\nand probity there will be no room for corruption. Staff will be hired on merit and professional\ncompetence not because of whom they know. All payments will be properly recorded; all\ndecisions will be made based on judgment not graft.\nA strong public enterprise has a strong sense of public service. That almost sounds old-\nfashioned in the 21st century but it is an important aspect of how well any government\ndepartment or state enterprise is run. It encompasses both national and personal pride in\nproviding high quality service to citizens and clients, and it leads on to the next one:\nNext, there should be respect for one\u2019s own work, for one\u2019s client and for one\u2019s co-workers.\nAdditionally, transparency and accountability are essential. Information is power, an adage\noften quoted, and it belongs to the people unless there is a threat to national security.\nRoadmap for public sector governance\nThe \u2018Good governance guide\u2019 which is a valuable reference for public sector employees with\ncorporate governance responsibilities has identified nine key result areas of good public\nsector governance. This section considers each of the factors to be useful in the assessment\nof good governance. Although the key result areas are based on the Western Australian\nPublic Services Commission guide, references have been made from various external sources\nto better develop and clarify the ideas.\nNine result areas are:7\n- The role of government and public institutions in good governance\n- Management and Oversight in governance\n- Management and structure and governance\n- Operations and Governance\n- Ethics and Integrity in Governance\n- Engaging citizens as partners in governance\n- Financial governance\n- Communication governance and\n- Risk management and governance\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n125 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nThey are analysed below:\nGovernment and public institutions\u2019 role in good governance\nEvery public sector entity or public service spends public money; how this money is spent\nand the quality of services it provides is critically important as citizens, users and taxpayers.\nTherefore, we need governance of public services to be of a high standard. Good governance\nleads to good management, good performance, good investment of public money, good public\nbehaviour and good outcomes. The governors of public services organisations face a difficult\ntask. They are the people handling governance \u2013 the leadership, direction, evaluation and\nmonitor of the organizations they serve. Their responsibility is to ensure that they address\nthe goals and objectives of these organisations and that they work in the public interest.\nThey have to bring about positive outcomes for the users, as well as providing value for\nthe taxpayers who fund these services. They have to balance the public interest with their\naccountability and compliance. There is clear evidence that many have difficulties in fulfilling\nthese responsibilities.\nManagement and Oversight in governance8\nMonitoring managerial performance and programme implementation, appointing key personnel,\napproving annual budgets and business plans, and overseeing major capital expenditures.\nPromoting high performance and efficient processes by establishing an appropriate balance\nbetween control by the governing body and entrepreneurship by the management unit.\nMonitoring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and with the regulations\nand procedures of the host organisation, as the case may be.\nOversight of public administration refers to the ability of an external body to review the\nconduct and decisions of government agencies and public officials. Such review may be by\nway of investigation, inspection or audit and can be based on a complaint, a legal obligation,\nor the oversight body\u2019s \u2018own motion\u2019.\nThe aim of external oversight is to maintain the integrity of government agencies and public\nofficials by holding them accountable for actions and decisions they will make while carrying\nout their duties. Accountability is a keystone of representative government, as it enhances\npublic confidence in the government sector and, conversely, helps ensure that government\nis responsive to the interests of the public. External oversight also provides a quality control\nmechanism for any internal review process existing in government agencies. While customers\nshould be encouraged to use agencies\u2019 internal review systems, in most cases they should have\nthe option to seek to have their complaints resolved externally if they remain dissatisfied.9\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n126 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nGovernance\u2019s management and structure\nOne of the most important tasks for any trustee is to know about their own organisation\u2019s\nlegal and governance structure and make sure it is suitable for what the organisation was set\nup to do. The legal structure, and the governance arrangements it sets in place, are a vital\npart of making solid foundations and keeping an organisation safe and secure. It means\nthat those who get involved in its work are protected, whether staff, volunteers, trustees or\nservice users. It also means the wider community and society can see the basis on which\nit operates.\nAll formal organisations must have a written set of rules laying down their objectives, the\nrights of members, and how to apply their assets. The generic term for this set of rules is\n\u2018governing document\u2019.\nIncorporation means creating a legal identity for an organisation that is separate from its\nmembers \u2013 a \u2018corporate body\u2019. A corporate body exists in its own right and offers good\nprotection to its members. Corporate forms limit the liability of their members unless\notherwise indicated and a corporate body can enter into contracts and own property in its\nown right. Organisations that have a moderate to high level of risk may decide to incorporate\nto protect their members in the future.10\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n112277 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nOperations and Governance\nA governance operating model may assist the board and management in fulfilling their\ngovernance roles. Such a model is likely to enable the board and the executive leadership to\norganise the governance structure and the mechanisms by which governance is implemented.\nBy the same token, the lack of a governance operating model may lead to an incomplete\nor faulty governance structure, or to inconsistencies, overlaps, and gaps among governance\nmechanisms. Such inadequacies may lead to failure to enact governance policies that the\nboard and management have put in place.\nThe sheer complexity of governance and the huge number of related procedures and other\nmechanisms in a global financial institution may indicate a need for a governance operating\nmodel. The elements of such a model may exist in many large companies. However,\nthose elements may not have been connected, rationalised, and organised to provide the\nconsistent guidance and incentives that executives, risk managers, and business unit leaders\nrequire. A governance operating model has the potential to address this need and thus\nenhance management\u2019s ability to implement governance and the board\u2019s ability to exercise\nproper oversight.11\nIn practice, a governance operating model should:\n- Organise operational, financial, risk management, and reporting processes such\nthat the board receives the information it requires to effect good governance and\nmanagement and the business units can conduct their activities in ways that comply\nwith regulations and serve strategic ends.\n- Bring the organisation\u2019s governance framework down to the level of roles,\nresponsibilities, reporting lines, and communications to bridge the gap between the\ngovernance framework (discussed in the following section) and operational realities.\n- Sustain governance by creating a feedback loop in which the board and management can\nidentify and respond to new business, operational, competitive, and regulatory needs.\nEthics and Integrity in Governance\nCitizens demand evidence of governments\u2019 efforts and achievements in fighting corruption\nand promoting integrity. But assessing the effectiveness of governments\u2019 measures poses\nspecific challenges, in particular the definition of a thorough and objective methodology.\nThe political sensitivity and hidden nature of corruption make this task particularly difficult.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n128 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nA clear set of criteria allows decision-makers to develop a consistent and comprehensive\napproach to assessment. Using explicit criteria distinguishes assessment from other approaches\nto strategic management in which priorities are set without reference to exact decisive factors.\nA rigorous assessment considers several aspects of policy measures are discussed in the table.\nIssues Criteria\nAre integrity policy instruments (like legal Formal existence of components of policy\nprovisions, code of conduct, institutions, instruments.\nprocedures) in place?\nAre integrity policy instruments capable Feasibility of specific policy instruments.\nof functioning as intended (realistic\nexpectations, resources and conditions)?\nDid the integrity policy instrument achieve Effectiveness of specific policy instruments.\nits specific initial objective(s)?\nHow significantly have policy instruments Relevance, the extent to which specific policy\ncontributed to meeting stakeholders\u2019 instruments and actions contribute to meeting\noverall expectations (for instance, actual stakeholders\u2019 overall expectations.\nimpact on daily behaviour)?\nDo the various elements of integrity policy Coherence of policy instruments, and their\ncoherently interact and enforce each other, relationship with other elements of the policy.\nand collectively support the overall aims of\nintegrity policy?\nAn applied assessment framework responds to specific needs through tailored assessment\ncriteria. Criteria can be defined both in relation to the context and the assessment process,\nso that they are:\nSufficiently specific \u2013 reflecting the specific purpose and the context of the assessment.\nTransparently constructed \u2013 involving stakeholders in the assessment process, consulting them\non the procedural steps and the development of specific criteria; ensuring that the assessment\nprocess reflect the views of stakeholders and could properly encapsulate their feedback to\nprovide a multifaceted source for forming balanced judgments on policy implementation\nand its impact.12\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n129 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nCase Study: Public sector governance13\nPublic sector governance focuses attention more discretely on governance in the public sector\ngenerally, or a designated level of government in particular. Governance in the formal system\nof government remains a distinct dimension of governance in its own right. It deserves\nseparate consideration. Public sector governance concentrates on authority as applied to\nthe governance of organisations in and across the public sector, including different levels of\ngovernment and their interactions with one another and other societal groups. So, public\nsector governance is not limited to governance as applied only to the formal administration\nof government, largely through the executive branch of government. In the context of\nthe system of government and public administration that lies at the core of public sector\ngovernance, the \u2018steering\u2019 role of government is paramount, not least in terms of the \u2018capacity\nof government to make and implement policy \u2013 in other words, to steer society\u2019.18\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n113300 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nThe term \u2018public sector governance\u2019 has been chosen to focus this guide on the governance\narrangements for public sector organisations at the Commonwealth level in Australia, as\noutlined in the definition below. Public sector governance has a very broad coverage, including\nhow an organisation is managed, its corporate and other structures, its culture, its policies\nand strategies and the way it deals with its various stakeholders. The concept encompasses\nthe manner in which public sector organisations acquit their responsibilities of stewardship\nby being open, accountable and prudent in decision-making, in providing policy advice,\nand in managing and delivering programmes.\nConsidered from in the system of government, Commonwealth governmental bodies are\nresponsive to one or more sources of public sector regulatory influence, according to their\norganisational type. This system of monitoring and review includes portfolio oversight and\nextends beyond the Commonwealth public sector and its members to other components\nof the executive arm of government (such as auditor-general, ombudsman, and other\nmechanisms of administrative review). However, considered from a broader governance\nperspective, Commonwealth governmental bodies are also increasingly subject to an array\nof public scrutiny and influence.\nSo, this system of monitoring and review also extends to other arms of constitutional\ngovernment (like judicial review and parliamentary committee scrutiny) and, even further,\nto the non-government sector and community as well. To the extent that this reflects\nenhanced scrutiny of government and input into public policy and standard-setting from\norganisations and communities outside of government, it resonates with the tension that\nexists between state centric and society-centric views of governance.\nSource: Edwards, M., Halligan, J., Horrigan, B., and Nicoll, G.

All fine in theory, but where to start in\npractice? While not having all the answers, a new OECD book, Citizens as Partners, has\nclosely scrutinised the issues, a range of country experiences and throws some light on the\nway forward.14\nThe starting point is clear. To engage people in policymaking, governments must invest\nadequate time and resources in building robust legal, policy and institutional frameworks.\nThey must develop and use appropriate tools, ranging from traditional opinion polls of the\npopulation at large to consensus conferences with small groups of laypersons. Experience\nhas shown, however, that without leadership and commitment throughout the public\nadministration, even the best policies will have little practical effect.\nThe key ingredients for success in engaging citizens in policymaking are close to hand,\nincluding information, consultation and public participation. Information provided has to\nbe objective, complete, relevant, easy to find and easy to understand.

No matter how good the rest of a council\u2019s governance\nmay be financial failure can bring it undone. Poor financial governance can imperil the\ncouncil\u2019s existence.

Improving governance\nrequires effective and sustainable public sector reform, and evidence suggests that communication\nactivities can help to achieve reform.\nAt the process level, communication can foster support for governance reform by influencing\nopinion, attitude, and behaviour change among:\n- leaders and policymakers (political will);\n- mid-level bureaucrats (organisational will); and\n- citizens (public will).\nAt the structural level, communication links citizens, civil society, the media, and government,\nforming a framework for national dialogue through which informed public opinion is shaped.\nAt the structural level, there are five entry points for communication strategies in governance\nreform. These relate to groups of stakeholders \u2013 between which strong accountability\nrelationships are needed.16\n- Public sector management (central executive): Support reform coalitions, middle\nmanager buy-in and national government communication capacity.\n- Formal oversight institutions (judiciary; parliaments): Support parliamentary\ncoalitions, public reporting mechanisms and institutional legitimacy.\n- Political accountability (political party and business leaders; civil society elites):\nSupport multi-stakeholder coalitions, policy dialogue, and deliberation and debate.\n- Local participation and community empowerment (local governments and\ncommunities): Support coalition-building, grassroots campaigns and local government\ncommunication capacity.\n- Civil society and the media/private sector interface (journalists and editors; private\nfirms): Support the engagement and participation of multiple stakeholders.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n134 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nRisk management and Governance17\nA number of governments, such as Canada and the UK, have developed frameworks for\nthe management of risks that may have an effect on their normal functioning and budgets.\nThese frameworks provide general guidance on the principles of risk management to support\ngovernment organisations to develop their own risk management processes. Such frameworks\ninclude identification and analysis of risks that may affect the pursuit of their objectives, as\nwell as on-going review and improvement of risk management practices.\nMost organisations intend to improve internal processes for risk management as well\nas to consider risk management in relation to the wider environment in which the\norganisation functions.\nThese frameworks provide guidance to risk assessment, management, and communication,\nand are moving towards enhanced risk management, including consideration of the needs to:\n- Improve organisational and societal resilience\n- Adopt proactive management approaches\n- Establish stakeholder confidence and trust\n- Strengthen reliable decision-making and planning\n- Provide practical advice (beyond principles and concepts), and\n- Focus attention on tackling organisational risk by identifying and treating both\nexternal and internal influences and factors that give rise to that risk.\nRisk ownership, incentives, and reward\nGovernments constantly need to keep under review where responsibility for managing a\nparticular emerging risk should best reside, as it is often difficult to identify who can or\nshould \u2018own\u2019 an emerging risk. Risk ownership, a term used to describe only those who\nhave a personal stake in a risk will deal with it, refers to creating links between cause and\neffect, between risk and reward. Some emerging issues offer opportunities as well as risks.\nBy identifying a possible reward for those who decide to engage and spend money to\nmitigate an emerging risk \u2013 and who will get a return on their investment \u2013 , the chances\nof successfully dealing with it will be higher, especially if policymakers establish political\nand business links between risk and opportunity, and communicate such opportunities.\nPoints\nEffective governance in the public sector encourages better decision making and the efficient\nuse of resources and strengthens accountability for the stewardship of those resources.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n135 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nGood corporate governance should provide proper incentives for the board and management\nto pursue objectives that are in the interests of the company and shareholders and should\nfacilitate effective monitoring, thereby encouraging firms to use resources more efficiently.\nEffective agencies focus on achieving good governance through: strategy, culture, relations,\nperformance, compliance, and accountability.\nGood governance leads to good management, effective performance, fair investment of\npublic money, sound public behaviour and excellent outcomes.\nAccountability is a keystone of representative government, it enhances public confidence in\nthe government sector and helps ensure government is responsive to the public\u2019s interests.\nA governance operating model may assist the board and management in fulfilling their\ngovernance roles.\nClear criteria allow decision-makers to assess consistently and comprehensively.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n113366 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor governanCe\nEngaging citizens in policy-making allows governments to tap new sources of ideas,\ninformation, and resources when making decisions.\nGood public financial governance is the legitimate use of power and authority in the\nmanagement of a country\u2019s financial resources with integrity, transparency, accountability,\nequity and a result orientation to promote development.\nImproving governance requires effective and sustainable public sector reform, and evidence\nsuggests that communication activities can help to achieve reform.\nQuestions\n1.

Politics\nis concerned with the members of the existing government in power. It is through the\ngovernment that ministries which are also governmental departments operate. In most\ncountries, whatever be their political structure, it is the government in power that decides\nwhat is to be done over the next few years that it is supposed to be in power. Evidently,\nthere should be a choice of ministers who are likely to take up the responsivity of becoming\nservants of the democracy and the citizens during their mandate and they will have to show\nhow effective they are.\nThis brings us to understand the role of politics in public administration. Generally,\npoliticians will be held accountable for devising policies in their area of expertise, if ever,\nthey are given the chance to head a department or ministry. Politicians are required to show\na high degree of impartiality and neutrality in whatever they will undertake. It is broadly\nnoted that most of the political decisions affecting the different departments emanate from\nthe governmental mandate and this is normally what should be implemented when the\npoliticians will be acting as ministers of the cabinet.\nBy just thinking of politicians as heads of cabinets, public opinion will vary significantly.\nSome will believe that politicians have total control of decisions affecting their department\nand top public officials might act as \u2018puppets\u2019 according to their whims. Others might\nhave a neutral view of politicians if such people would respect ethical values and show\ntransformational leadership in their endeavours. There will also be negative opinion of\npoliticians if developments or changes are slow to occur in the public service while, at\nthe same time, there is a high level of wastage, lack of transparency or \u2018laissez-faire\u2019 style\nof leadership.\nSince public officers are expected to be neutral and comply with the government holding\npower today, they are in some difficulty between the choice of taking decisions as imposed\nfrom the top or making their own decisions. Employee autonomy and freedom of choice\nare granted in democratic public organisations, but there is always the apprehension that\nthe politician or the Minister should have the final say. This creates embarrassment in public\nservice administration and governance but it is also a fact that politicians want to see how\ntheir achievements re being seen both by the users of public service and stakeholders who\nalso form part of the scenario.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n140 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nSo long as departments or ministries are functioning correctly, the political influence remains\ngood and acceptable by all the players in the system. But when there are allegations of\nmalpractice, corruption, and poor performance, politicians are first to be brought to public\nattention. This is where the politician might be judged by the public and independent\noversight institutions.\nThis chapter attempts to provide an overview of political issues affecting public administration\ntaking into consideration that, despite there are variations in political administration, there\nare areas that are common to readers from different environments since issues like leadership,\npolitical influence, corruption, malpractice or alternately, governance, do impact on the\nday-to-day administration of this important organisation.\nInsight: Importance of understanding public administration\u2019s politics1\nMelissa Clary, Southern Nevada ASPA Secretary, explains the role and influence of politics\nin public administration. As public administrators behind the scenes, we are responsible for\nenacting most of these policy changes. We are tasked with achieving agency missions and\nproviding public service in the heat of such political environments. It is simply not possible\nto approach a policy issue in American government without considering the leading political\nparty behind the final decision or voting power. Understanding the political ramifications\nconfronting elected officials in light of our bureaucratic processes and final recommendations\nis essential to accomplishing our agency tasks and achieving success. If an elected official is\nfacing re-election, she will understandably vote differently than she might have had with a\nclose election cycle closing in. The expressed justification for voting a certain way may not\nbe heard or even addressed if the elected official is facing public scrutiny.\nAn added challenge in setting policy is to consider the multiple political interests facing a\npotential policy shift, such as those experienced in a multi-member elected council, board\nof supervisors, or commission system. To accomplish a task, management must consider\nthe political interests and voting climate in which policy changes will occur. Knowing the\npolitical climate for an issue will change the timeframe, implementation, and message utilised\nby public administrators who set out to address new policy changes.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n141 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nManagement and administrators higher up in the organisational structure generally\nunderstand the politics of policy making better than field staff and others situated further\nfrom government leaders and elected officials. Policy making is typically a confusing and\nunknown activity for field staff who do not directly concern themselves with the political\nmaelstrom that is the governmental decision making process. It is no wonder field staff\ntend to identify management and agency bureaucratic leaders as being out-of-touch and\nineffective when they do not deal with the political system in the same way these leaders do.\nDecisions like what programmes to cut or public facilities to close may not seem logical or\njustified to field staff, when in fact, there may be political heat facing bureaucrats making\nsuch decisions.\nCitizens\u2019 Accountability in policy decisions\nThe doctrine of ministerial accountability means when civil servants appear before Parliament\nit is as ministers\u2019 proxies. They get neither credit nor blame. By contrast, in both Finland\nand Sweden, civil servants operate under legal frameworks which give them a considerable\ndegree of autonomy and accountability. As we have already noted, political and constitutional\nsystems are complex, and must be considered in their entirety.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n114422 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nIn the United Kingdom, the legal assumption is civil servants act on ministers\u2019 behalf,\nand exercise ministers\u2019 powers. In contrast, in Sweden and Finland civil servants are legally\naccountable themselves for the decisions they take, and will personally be held to account for\nthose decisions. We have argued against the feasibility or desirability of a formal separation\nof accountability of this kind. Nonetheless, we believe civil servants could be considerably\nmore open with Parliament without threatening the doctrine of ministerial responsibility.2\nPoliticians Accountability in public administration\nMinisters handle:\n- setting the overall strategy and policies of the Department.\n- setting clear performance targets for each part of the Home Office and holding\nofficials accountable for delivery.\n- accounting to Parliament and the public for the policy and delivery of the Home Office.\nIn doing so they will:\n- take and communicate clear and timely decisions based on evidence and accurate\ndata \u2013 ensure decisions reflect an understanding of resource constraints.\n- focus on policy and outcomes knowing weakness, in relation to both processes and\nindividual performance, will be tackled.\n- support the need for officials to make operational judgments, with the expectation\nthey will be kept informed of matters which potentially have a strategic or reputational\nrisk or impact \u2013 allow managers the freedom to deploy staff and resources to achieve\nthe policy and performance objectives.\n- review performance regularly and give feedback.\nMinisters\u2019 roles and duties as politicians and administrators3\nMinisters decide both the direction and the priorities for their departments. They should\nnot be involved in their departments\u2019 day-to-day operations. In general terms, Ministers\nmanage determining and promoting policy, defending policy decisions, and answering in\nthe House on both policy and operational matters. Officials are responsible for:\n- supporting Ministers in carrying out their ministerial functions;\n- serving the aims and objectives of Ministers by developing and implementing policy\nand strategy; and\n- implementing the decisions of the government of the day.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n143 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nAccountability documents\nMinisters are concerned not only with the short-term performance of their departments, but\nalso with the capability of their departments to continue to deliver government objectives\nin the longer term. Ministers\u2019 priorities for departments and the standard of performance\nexpected of their departments are specified in several key accountability documents.4\nOne-year performance information is included in supporting information to specifying\nexpected performance.\nMedium-term performance information is included in the statements of intent, which are\nat least three-year documents setting out departmental strategic performance priorities,\nobjectives, and capability.\nEvery chief executive agrees performance expectations with his or her responsible Minister.\nThese expectations are outlined in the chief executive\u2019s job description and subsequent\nperformance reviews.\nMinister\u2019s role as a politician and decision-maker\nMinisters are members of the executive arm of government and have both a collective and\nindividual role. As a collective, ministers support the head of state and government to ensure\nthe change society desires happens. They make sure to deliver their political manifesto\u2019s\npromises to the electorate. They also support the head of state and government in promoting\nand defending government policies, decisions and actions. They are collectively accountable\nfor the government\u2019s performance, whether good or bad.\nMinisters must speak for and defend other ministers to the public. This requires a minister\nto have a comprehensive understanding of other portfolios and the programmes, projects\nand services in those portfolios, as well as the progress that is being made. Ministers are\ntheir ministries\u2019 political head and public face. They set the policy agenda for their ministry,\nbased on the overall government policy framework and the political manifesto, and provide\npolitical direction and guidance for their ministry to realise strategic policy goals critical\nfor national development.\nMinisters also help to mobilise financial resources for policy implementation; articulate\ntheir ministry\u2019s programmes and priorities in Cabinet; and provide information on their\nministry\u2019s performance to parliament and the electorate.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n144 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nIn the African context, the public looks up to ministers to deliver on the political manifesto\nand the promises made during their political campaigns. This is why members of the public\nchannel questions on development to ministers through their Members of Parliament.\nSometimes, the public demand certain development projects directly from relevant ministers,\nparticularly if the ministers are their Members of Parliament. Ministers should not be\ninvolved in the day-to-day management of their ministry, nor in the hiring and firing of\ncivil servants.\nMaintaining public service\u2019s neutrality\nNeutrality of the public service requires civil servants to be apolitical in carrying out their\nfunctions, and impartial in implementing government policies, programmes and projects. It is\nthe neutrality of the public service that allows civil servants to serve different governments and\nensure everything continues to run smoothly during the transition between two governments,\nwhich may not necessarily be formed by the same ruling party in multi-party democracies.5\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n114455 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nIn a neutral public service, appointments, promotions and tenure of civil servants are not\ndependent on a particular ruling party or minister being in power, but on the prescriptions\nof public service acts and regulations. This minimises the possibility of civil servants serving\npartisan political interests instead of national interest. While political neutrality is supposed\nto be part of the public service ethos, the reality is most public services in Commonwealth\nAfrica are not as apolitical as they are supposed to be.\nWith the advent of multi-party democracy in Africa, there has been a trend in some countries\nfor civil servants to over-align themselves to the ruling political party, a situation that militates\nagainst political neutrality. Some countries have not been able to optimise utilisation of the\ntalent they have because some talent is perceived as belonging to opposition parties.\nCase Study: Political public sector bashing: unforeseen consequences6\nPoliticians who openly criticise civil servants\u2019 work should beware the impact on trust in\nthe organisation. In a report on trust failures in organisations for the Chartered Institute of\nPersonnel and Development, researchers studied trust levels across UK working population\nand found the trust among those working in the public sector, including the civil service, was\nlower than either their private or not-for-profit counterparts. While this is not surprising, as\nthese are large organisations, our survey identified evidence of a distinctly negative climate.\nThe researchers spoke to groups of civil servants and found trust in the public service requires\na careful balance, mainly because roles in the sector continue, despite changes in political\nleadership. Civil servants revealed how those at the top of their organisation have a distinct\nand important role in balancing their political masters. There must also be similar balance\nbetween staff and the public they serve.\nSimilar studies reveal while positive social identities are developed among group members,\nhaving an impact on a person\u2019s self-definition, the same attachment makes it unacceptable\nto fail to show due care for the collective enterprise of the group. In the focus groups\nwith civil servants, it was evident they viewed themselves as being a public servant; an\nactive occupational choice which may have distinct financial costs to them, but a strong\nidentity nonetheless.\nLittle attention has been paid by organisational psychologists to politicians as a type of\nworkers, and political psychologists have neglected insights that might contribute a broader\nunderstanding of factors that influence not only political campaigning, but also performance\nin office.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n146 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nPolitical leaders, recent performances show little evidence of their care and concern for the\npublic servants who staff their ministries, and the public accounts committee is challenging\nthe wisdom behind some of the choices being made.\nTrust is a very fragile commodity; we have a few great examples, such as John Lewis, that\nshow how effective leaders can manage through a crisis, and not only maintain, but actually\nenhance trust level among followers.\nTrust is also developed and sustained through incremental steps, which include competence,\nrespect, and integrity. Once trust has gone it can be very difficult to get back, so there are\nconsequences in blaming followers for failures.\nThe research suggests in the civil service, those in the most senior roles need to be careful\nnot to align themselves in toxic situations with their political masters and leave their staff\nfeeling unsupported and undefended. Unfortunately, a further unforeseen consequence of\npublic sector bashing will be the erosion of the talent pool both of those who want to\nbecome public servants, and also those who want to become elected politicians.\nSource: Searle, R. (2013) Political public sector bashing: the unforeseen consequences, The\nGuardian, 25th September 2013.\nQuestions\n1. What is the relevance of politicians in public sector decision-making?\n2. Why do public officers need trust from politicians?\n3. Why is leadership essential for politicians on public administration?\nInsight: How power corrupts leaders\nMost people have heard the line \u2018Power corrupts\u2019 \u2013 or the longer version, \u2018Absolute power\ncorrupts absolutely.\u2019 The question often asked is \u2018why and how does power corrupt leaders?\u2019\nThe answer is complex, but fairly clear. Leadership, at its core, is all about power and\ninfluence. Leaders use their power to get things done. A simple distinction is between two\nforms of power. Socialised power is power used to benefit others. We hope our elected\nofficials have this sort of power in mind and are primarily concerned with the best interests\nof their constituents.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n147 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nThe other form of power is called personalised power, and it is using power for personal\ngain. Importantly, these two forms of power are not mutually exclusive. A leader can use\nhis or her power to benefit others, but can also gain personally \u2013 there are no poor former\nUS Presidents! The obvious problem is when personalized power dominates and the leader\ngains, often at the followers\u2019 expense.\nYet, leaders can delude themselves they are working for the greater good using socialised\npower, but act in morally wrong ways. A sense of power can cause a leader to engage in\nwhat leadership ethicist, Terry Price, calls \u2018exception making\u2019 \u2013 believing the rules governing\nright and wrong does not apply to the powerful. \u2018For other people, this would be wrong,\nbut because I have the best interests of my followers at hand could not have acted illegally\nbecause, it\u2019s ok for me to\u2026.\u2019 During Watergate, the argument was made President Nixon\n\u2018the President is above the law.\u2019\nLeaders can also become \u2018intoxicated\u2019 by power \u2013 engaging in wrong behaviour simply because\nthey can and they can get away with it and followers are willing to collude and make such\nexceptions \u2018It\u2019s ok because he/she is the leader\u2019. Some have suggested President Clinton\u2019s\nengaged in a sexual dalliance with intern Monica Lewinsky simply because \u2018he could.\u2019\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n114488 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nPower has advantages and disadvantages for leaders.\nOn the positive side, power makes leaders more assertive and confident and certain of their\ndecisions. This enables them to move forward on chosen courses of action. Leaders must\nuse power to \u2018get the job done.\u2019\nOn the negative side, the more people possess power, the more they focus on their own\negocentric desires and the less able they are to see others\u2019 perspectives.7\nPolitical administration ethics\nEthics is gaining prominence in the discourse about governance today. There are some\nperception standards in public life are in decline. This raises questions about the costs of\nmisconduct on the part of those who have been entrusted with guarding public interest and\nresources. These costs are losses in trust and confidence in public institutions and losses in\nprecious resources which were meant to support the economic and social development of\nnations and peoples. There is a move worldwide to restore a measure of trust and integrity\nin public institutions and officials, to safeguard democracy and promote better governance.8\nPolitics: favouritism, cronyism, and nepotism9\nThere is a strong consensus in the international development community on the need\nfor civil-service reform in developing countries. The civil services of the more advanced\ncountries enjoy merit selection, insulation from undue political influence, and \u2013 to the extent\npossible \u2013 arrangements to promote the productivity of civil servants. The civil services of\nthe developing countries tend to be large, underpaid, and politicised. Senior cadres lack\nprofessional depth and often fail to provide any chain of continuity in government over\nthe longer term. So, delivery of public services tends to be inefficient and, often, beset by\ncorruption. In the last four decades in Sierra Leone, we have come to recognise most of the\ncivil services appointments in the country are based on favouritism, cronyism, and nepotism\ndue to corruption and misuse of public funds has been the order of the day. Hence the call\nto depoliticize the civil service in Sierra Leone is urgently needed.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n149 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor\u2019s PolitiCal issues\nAs favouritism is the broadest of these related terms, we\u2019ll start with its definition. Basically\nfavouritism is just what it sounds like; it\u2019s favouring a person not because she is doing the\nbest job but rather because of some extraneous feature-membership in a favoured group,\npersonal likes and dislikes. Favouritism can be demonstrated in hiring, honouring, or\nawarding contracts. A related idea is patronage, giving public service jobs to those who may\nhave helped elect the person who has the power of appointment. Favouritism has always\nbeen a complaint in government service. They believed connections, partisanship, and other\nfactors played a role.\nCronyism is a more specific form of favouritism, referring to partiality towards friends and\nassociates. Cronyism occurs in a network of insiders \u2013 the \u2018good old\u2019 boys,\u2019 who confer\nfavours to each other.\nNepotism is an even narrower form of favouritism. Coming from the Italian word for\nnephew, it covers favouritism to members of the family. Both nepotism and cronyism are\noften at work when political parties recruit candidates for public office.\nPolitical-administrative interface\nA successful political-administrative interface in the public service is at the core of good\npublic sector governance and effectiveness, which is critical for improved public service\ndelivery and the achievement of national development goals. Although improving public\nsector effectiveness in service delivery and facilitating socio-economic development in Africa\nhas been at the centre of the development debate in the last few decades, strengthening the\npolitical-administrative interface has not received as much attention as it deserves.10\nQuality leadership focuses on the common good has been identified by most public sector\npractitioners, academics and commentators as one of the key factors that will enable most\nAfrican countries to realise their national vision statements. In the context of the public\nservice, this leadership is at political, technical and administrative levels. While there has\nbeen commendable effort among many Commonwealth African countries to develop the\ncapacity of administrative leadership, most technical leaders and political leaders have not\nbeen adequately exposed to formal leadership training.

Generally, public bodies are provided with finance through the annual\nbudget while they will rely on their operating budgets to manage the different tasks for\ntheir day-to-day running. As a convention, most of the finance is spent on the payment\nof wages, funding debts and paying for agencies or firms that provide their service to the\ndifferent ministries or departments.\nThere is also the commercial aspect of certain public and parapublic bodies which might\ngenerate finance through the sales and receipts of certain tasks like paying and collecting\nfines, licence fees, taxes and other contributions both by the public and independent private\ncorporations. These revenues might also be a major source of financing for public institutions\nas well as their survival.\nA key concern for the public organisation is the need to manage finances in the most efficient\nand effective way. By relying on heavy budgets, the public sector is a heavy consumer of\nfinances and care is ensured money is spent in the most accurate manner. Annual audit\nexercises state there many departments are under performing simply because they might\nlack finances while others are still poor performers despite finances might have been overly\nused with the threat of financial waste.\nThis chapter looks into the relevance of finance for government budgeting, the importance\nof managing finances, the benefits of developing governmental budgets as well as the benefits\nand risks involved in managing them. There is also a brief evaluation of performance metrics\nlinked with setting performance ratios in assessing how effective the overall budget is.\nPublic Sector Financial Management\nHigh-quality financial information in the public sector enables an accurate and complete\nassessment of the impact of policy decisions, supports external reporting by governments\nto electorates, taxpayers, and investors, and aids internal decisions on resource allocation\n(planning and budgeting), monitoring, and accountability.\nIn some countries, greater efforts are required to support public sector accountancy and the\nbroader topic of public financial management.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n155 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nAlthough some professional accountancy organisations (PAOs) maintain a strong public\nsector membership and undertake services and activities to support public sector accountancy\nand financial management, many PAOs struggle to identify how they can support this area.\nAdditionally, in some cases, legislation or organisational bylaws restrict support for public\nsector accountancy and financial management.1\nThe accountancy profession can leverage the:\n- knowledge gained through development of systems of training, education, and\npreparation of accountancy professionals;\n- experience assisting professional accountants in transitioning from national to\ninternational standards; and\n- international insight into best practices in quality control and investigation and\ndiscipline to support public sector efforts to professionalize and enhance the capacity\nof their workforces, adopt and implement international standards, and develop\ninternal processes for quality control in the government.\nThe importance of strong and sound public financial management\nPublic financial management is absolutely critical to improving the quality of public\nservice outcomes. It affects how funding is used to address national and local priorities,\nthe availability of resources for investment and the cost-effectiveness of public services. It\nis more than likely the public will trust public sector organisations more if there is strong\nfinancial stewardship, accountability and transparency in the use of public funds.\nIt is important for governments to get it right because it impacts on a broad range of areas\nincluding:\n- aggregate financial management \u2013 fiscal sustainability, resource mobilisation\nand allocation\n- operational management \u2013 performance, value-for money and budget management\n- governance \u2013 transparency and accountability\n- fiduciary risk management \u2013 controls, compliance and oversight.2\nIn addition, effective public financial management is important for decision making.\nAccurate financial information is often used as the mechanism to support decisions and\nensure effective resource allocations.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n156 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nMichael Parry\u2019s Four Dimensions of Public Financial Management3\nTo have a clear understanding of the four dimensions of public financial management, this\nsection has taken excerpts from Michael Parry\u2019s work in 2010. This is an essential piece of\nwork whereby the dimensions are different but interrelated.\nThe first dimension is aggregate fiscal management in the sense all governments are indebted\nto managing finances so they work profitably and without budgetary constraints. In doing\nso, public departments are entrusted to have the most efficient resources mobilised so they\nachieve desired results.\nThe second dimension covers operational management which refers to the day-to-day\nrunning of public business. Performance management on daily business is important to\nensure money is well used. Users of public services expect to get value for money for what\nthey can expect from the government. This also depends on how budgets are managed by\nthe public bodies.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n115577 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nThe third dimension covers fiduciary risk management whereby finances must be strictly\ncontrolled. Mismanaging funds corrupts and so is something to avoid. In this dimension,\nthere is equally the need to have financial oversight in that external organisations as well\nas internal audits can cast a good glance on finances and see how well they are managed.\nThe last dimension, according to Perry (2010) considers governance which was covered in an\nearlier chapter. Under this dimension, two key elements are accountability and transparency.\nThis is something essential today seen from the various scandals that affected large financial\ncompanies but equally apply to public bodies. It is government\u2019s wish the sound management\nof finances contributes to the advancement of the economy through a well-structured and\nhigh-performing public service. The dimensions are detailed below.\nDimension 1: Aggregate fiscal management\nA fundamental requirement of every government is to manage its finances at the aggregate\nlevel. The accounting model represents the financial flows and resultant balance sheets and\nhence provides basis for monitoring, controlling and ultimately managing public finances.\nThree specific objectives of aggregate fiscal management are identified:\nFiscal sustainability\nOne of the most fundamental responsibilities for any entity is aggregate fiscal management\nto fund its activities from revenues and borrowings whilst remaining solvent \u2013 the objective\nof fiscal sustainability. For many countries achieving fiscal sustainability has become an\nincreasing challenge over the last two years when faced with bailing out major financial\ninstitutions. This has posed new issues of aggregate fiscal management of sovereign entities\nand the implicit guarantees made by such entities regarding their banking sector. Sovereign\nentity debt is being \u201crated\u201d in the same way as commercial entities on the basis of their\nbalance sheet and future cash flows.\nMaximising resource mobilisation\nAlmost all entities are constrained by limited financial resources. Public financial management\n(PFM) has an objective in managing resource mobilisation in policy fiscal goals.\nPerceived strong public financial management will be a factor in encouraging both public\nand private inward investment. For poor countries this will include encouraging support\nfrom development partners. Also for poor countries, enhanced public financial management\ncan be one element in improving the ability to absorb and utilise external aid, increasing\nresource availability.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n158 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nResource allocation under policy priorities\nIt is tempting to see public financial management as \u2018policy neutral\u2019; as providing the\nmechanism for implementing whatever policies a government adopts with no responsibility\nfor the policies. But this view is naive. By deciding what to measure and how to present\ninformation, the accountant influences policy decisions.\nPFM through the budget process should provide a mechanism for linking policy objectives\nwith the constraint of financial resources. However, whilst the objective of resource allocation\nunder policy priorities seems simple, it is difficult to achieve. This is due to articulating\npolicy priorities, the interdependence between the measurement system, the identification\nof priorities, and the difficulty of making reliable forecasts extending several years into\nthe future.\nDimension 2: Operational management\nFinancial management has a significant role in the operational management of the day-to-\nday activities of government.\nEffective performance management\nA major constraint of PFM is the accounting model of \u2018not for profit\u2019 activities does not\nprovide an input\u2010output model for the public sector. Inputs can be expressed in money\nunits, but outputs are typically service delivery. This contrasts with the commercial sector\nwhere accounting is a universal input\u2010output model using a common measure of money.\nInputs (costs) and outputs (sales) are measured in money units and the difference of profit,\nalso in money units, providing a comprehensive basis for performance management. The\ndevelopment in the public sector of performance measures and management is an attempt\nto address the gap by developing non\u2010financial measures of performance.\nDelivering value for money\nThe value for money objective could be seen as part of the overall performance management\nobjective, but in fact it has a narrower perspective. Performance measures are concerned\nwith achieving objectives. Value for money is simply a matter of ensuring PFM contributes\npositively to delivering value for money, which can be divided into effectiveness, efficiency,\nand economy.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n159 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nManaging within the budget\nThe public sector is budget-driven. Without a budget, governments lack legal authority to\nraise revenues or to make expenditures. When a sum is allocated in a budget it is to be\nspent for the purpose indicated. Over spending is a regulatory issue that will have to be\ncorrected either by reallocation or by a supplementary budget. On the other hand, under\nspending represents a failure to utilise allocated resources. The objective of many public\nsector managers to spend the budget, neither more nor less, is in fact logically consistent\nwith a budget driven process.\nDimension 3: Fiduciary risk management\nA problem facing all entities is fiduciary risk \u2013 the risk of public money being stolen, used\nfor purposes other than those intended, or used corruptly. There is a balance in fiduciary\nrisk management between the cost of avoiding risks and the cost of such risks crystallising.\nPFM is part of the solution and provides important tools of risk management.\nEffective financial control\nThe accounting system should provide a whole system of fiduciary controls, usefully summarised\nunder European Union (EU) nomenclature as Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC).\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n116600 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nThis includes:\n- Internal controls within an organisation, for example payment authorisation process,\nmanaging against budgets, reconciliation processes, and so on. These controls should\nbe specifically designed to minimise the risk of loss.\n- Internal audit \u2013 the oversight system established by the management of an organisation\nunder international standards of internal audit.\nIn addition, external audit provides an additional element of risk management. All public\nsector entities should have in place a structure of internal and external controls so as to\nreduce fiduciary risk to acceptable levels.\nCompliance with constitutional legal and regulatory requirements\nGovernments operate in a rule bound environment. There is a hierarchy of regulation\nstarting with the constitution and moving down through laws to the detailed financial rules,\ninstructions and procedures. This bureaucratic structure is another element of fiduciary risk\nmanagement and is designed to minimise the scope for activities which are not under public\npolicy such as to minimise fiduciary risk.\nProper oversight of public finances\nThe last element of fiduciary risk management is oversight, particularly by the legislature.\nTypically, a committee of the legislature, like a \u2018Public Accounts Committee\u2019 will review\nfinancial and audit reports of individual units in Government, such Ministries and Departments.\nIn many cases the review will be supported by technical staff.\nAn open and powerful oversight process can be a powerful tool in fiduciary risk management.\nIt can lend power to the auditor, use parliamentary privilege to identify issues and make\npronouncements and the mere existence of the system can be a powerful incentive for\neffective control procedures. At a sub\u2010national level a similar system should exist through\nlocal government public account committees, audit committees and similar tools.\nDimension 4: Governance\nThe governance dimension has great significance in government because of the concept\nof government acting according to the will of the people. Whilst the people \u2013 the civil\nsociety \u2013 are the primary stakeholder there will also be external stakeholders, like lenders,\nmultilateral organisations. Thus public sector governance has to meet the needs of all of\nthese groups and at all levels of government.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n161 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nGovernance structures that reflect the interest of stakeholders\nIn theory, a democratic government should reflect the will of the people and hence provides\nits own governance. In practice, the most democratic systems put intervening barriers between\npublic will and government policy, and specific mechanisms are required to overcome\nsuch barriers. The issue applies at national government and local government levels, and\nparticularly to government agencies managed by unelected officials.\nTransparency\nTransparency is broader than financial information, but financial information will be an\nimportant part of transparent government. This includes all of published budgets, financial\nstatements and audit reports, as well as other financial information published by government.\nThe messages in the data must be made explicit; this requires judgments as to the appropriate\nmessages, and hence the provision of relevant financial information. This is the same issue\nas noted above on budget allocations; there is an interdependent relationship between the\ninformation and judgements based on the information. Financial information will identify\nspecific issues depending on the way it is classified and aggregated.\nAccountability\nAccountability goes beyond transparency and involves identifying individual responsibility\nfor actions. Thus it can be seen as the end point of a participative and transparent process.\nAgain accountability extends beyond accounting issues, but the latter will be a major element\nof the accountability process.\nThe level of accountability interacts with the basis on which budget holders are rewarded,\nand affects a needed level of central control. Hence it has a profound effect on the design\nof the budget preparation, execution and accounting systems. PFM systems must have clear\ninbuilt assumptions about exactly how accountability will work \u2013 and they will need to be\nprogressively redesigned as accountability improves. Therefore, they must be either flexible\nor inexpensive \u2013 an expensive inflexible system will hold up progress.\nGovernment budgeting\nSome of the important objectives of government budget are as follows: the reallocation of\nResources, reducing inequalities in income and wealth, economic stability, management\nof public enterprises, economic growth, and reducing regional disparities. Government\nprepares the budget for fulfilling certain objectives. These objectives are the direct outcome\nof government\u2019s economic, social and political policies.4\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n162 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nThe various objectives of government budget are:\nReallocation of Resource\nThrough the budgetary policy, Government aims to reallocate resources under the economic\n(profit maximisation) and social (public welfare) priorities of the country. Government can\ninfluence allocation of resources through:\n- Tax concessions or subsidies\nTo encourage investment, government can give tax concession, and subsidies. to the\nproducers. For example, Government discourages the production of harmful consumption\ngoods \u2013 like liquor and cigarettes, heavy taxes \u2013 and encourages the use of necessities by\nproviding subsidies.\n- Directly producing goods and services\nIf the private sector does not take interest, government can directly undertake the production.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n116633 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nReducing income and wealth inequality\nEconomic inequality is inherent in each economy. Government aims to reduce income and\nwealth inequalities through budgetary policy. Government aims to influence distribution\nof income by imposing taxes on the rich and spending more on the poor\u2019s welfare. It will\nreduce income of the rich and raise standard of living of the poor, reducing inequalities in\nthe distribution of income.\nEconomic Stability\nGovernment budget is used to prevent business fluctuations of inflation or deflation to achieve\nthe objective of economic stability. The government aims to control the different phases of\nbusiness fluctuations through its budgetary policy. Policies of surplus budget during inflation\nand deficit budget during deflation helps to maintain stability of prices in the economy.\nManagement of Public Enterprises\nThere are many public sector industries (especially natural monopolies), which are established\nand managed for social welfare of the public. Budgets are prepared to various provisions\nfor managing such enterprises and providing those financial help.\nEconomic Growth\nThe growth rate of a country depends on rate of saving and investment. For this purpose,\nbudgetary policy aims to mobilise sufficient resources for investment in the public sector.\nTherefore, the government makes various provisions in the budget to raise overall rate of\nsavings and investments in the economy.\nReducing regional disparities\nThe government budget aims to reduce regional disparities through its taxation and expenditure\npolicy for encouraging setting up of production units in economically backward regions.\nInsight: Institutional drivers of efficiency in the public sector5\nOverall, the evidence is scant surprisingly. Available research is inconclusive on the efficiency\nof varying inputs used or of changing managerial structures. Some findings emerged, however,\nin three areas.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n164 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nFirst, it seems efficiency gains could be obtained by increasing the scale of operations, based\non evidence collected mainly in the education and health sectors. This effect is attributed\nto economies of scale that result from savings in overhead costs and fixed costs in tangible\nassets. However, the impact on other public sector values such as equity, access to services,\nand the quality of services needs to be taken into account.\nSecond, functional and political decentralisation (like spending responsibility) to sub-national\ngovernments also seems beneficial for efficiency. In principle, devolution of functional\nresponsibilities, if accompanied by appropriate fiscal and political decentralisation, provides\nincentives for sub central governments to deliver locally preferred services more efficiently,\nas the burden and the benefits of public service delivery both accrue in the communities.\nEvidence from federal countries shows decentralised taxation reduces the size of government;\nhowever, evidence on the comparison of countries is inconclusive.\nThird, human resource management practices also matter. The soft aspects of human resource\nmanagement, such as employee satisfaction and morale, are considered to be the most\nimportant drivers of performance. While wages are still important for staff, non-monetary\nincentives are also essential. High wage levels \u2013 compared to similar work in the private\nsector \u2013 could lead to inefficiencies, although governments often are model employers and\ntheir wage policies reflect equity concerns as well. Wages are also important for attracting\nand retaining qualified staff, especially in case of skill shortages. Performance-related pay\ninitiatives appear to have a low impact on staff motivation.\nUse of performance-based metrics by government6\nMany organisations use performance-based metrics in their budgeting processes, and this\npractice has become more common in the public sector. Regulatory demands have changed a\ngreat deal in a short time, and this form of budgeting helps governments determine whether\nfunding is being allocated and make public policy decisions.\nAfter years of fighting the global recession, governments face increased pressure to reach\nfinancial goals while simultaneously meeting the expectations of their citizens. Additionally,\nthe recession made the expenditures of certain programs in some countries less predictable.\nThe higher demands created a need for data-driven budgeting measures to ensure performance.\nDespite the recognized importance of performance-based budgeting, many governments still\nstruggle to incorporate these measures into their budgeting processes.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n165 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nBenefits of performance-based budgeting\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, performance-based budgeting\nhelps governments overcome some of these pressures because it:\n- Defines measurable outcomes for allocated funds.\n- Focuses on adjusting funding instead of baselines.\n- Identifies programmes and agencies with similar goals to form correlations.\n- Gives agencies flexibility.\n- Potentially curbs funding to poorly performing programmes.\nPerformance measures can even help legislators draw background data for state-funded\nprogrammes to justify future funding decisions. In the past, many government agencies\nfought to maintain the same programs and historic spending levels, but performance-based\nbudgeting helps officials more readily identify inefficiencies to make adjustments that\nimprove the budgeting process. Performance data increases understanding of policy and\nprograms across an entity. Better access to information allows officials to make quicker and\nwell-informed decisions.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n116666 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nChallenges of performance-based budgeting\nAlthough performance-based budgeting has many key advantages, some organizations suffer\nfrom incomplete or inaccurate information. On top of this issue, some public sector agencies\ndo not use the right incentives and disincentives to make measurable improvements.\nTo use performance-based budgeting, officials need to realise that metrics are an indicator\nof results rather than the outcome itself, the IMF stated. Additionally, applying metrics\nto every aspect of the process may not be effective because compliance is time-consuming\nand costly. Simply gathering data does not lead to a genuine improvement of the results.\nAgencies need to determine key areas for success and establish metrics that enable them to\ntrack improvements.\nAnother challenge is understanding what the data means. For example, when a public\nhealth system wants to improve health outcomes, simply spending more may not produce\nthe desired result because outcomes have a variety of influences.\nManaging Public Resources\nA basic tenet in financial management is costs should be incurred only if by so doing, the\ncommunity or organisation can expect to move toward agreed-upon goals and objectives.\nDetermining whether the commitment of governmental resources improves conditions in\nthe broader community can get complicated, however, particularly when no basis exists for\nassessing the value to people of such actions. Many public choices are still open to political\ndecision. Despite the best efforts to achieve rigour and sophistication, scientific analysis\ncannot provide definitive answers to many of the questions involved in the allocation of\ngovernment resources. Nevertheless, a continuous search must be maintained for more\nproductive ways to operate public organisations and to assess their capacity to meet changing\nconditions and demands for the delivery of services.\nThe common denominator among the various resources of any organisation is the cost\ninvolved in their utilisation. The production of public and quasi-public goods and services\nrequires the acquisition and allocation of relatively scarce resources, the values of which\nare measured and compared in the common unit of dollars. Consequently, the focus of\nmanagement most often is on financial resources.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n167 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nCase Study: Improving performance at state-owned enterprises\nDespite the wave of privatisation across developing markets in the 1980s and \u201990s, state-\nowned enterprises continue to control vast swaths of national GDP: more than 50 percent\nin some African countries and up to 15 percent in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.\nThese companies, controlled by a government or a government agency, struggle to meet\nthe private sector\u2019s performance levels, and potential profits remain unrealised. During the\ncurrent downturn, some state-owned enterprises \u2013 even as they face increased pressure to\nbecome more efficient \u2013 have been called on to support government stimulus plans through\nhigher spending and job retention. Nonetheless, our research and experience show these\nenterprises can significantly improve their performance, notwithstanding the constraints of\nthe public-sector model and the tough economic times.\nEven in normal times, for example, the average return on assets at state enterprises in China\nwas less than half of the private sector, a McKinsey study showed a few years ago. One reason\nis many such companies, in China and elsewhere, are shielded from competitive pressures,\nbut other factors contribute greatly as well. State enterprises often juggle multiple, unclear,\nor conflicting financial and social objectives, such as providing blanket, low-cost telephone\nservice. Political interference can prompt decisions that threaten a company\u2019s financial goals.\nFinding talented workers at all levels is a problem too: the best and brightest gravitate\ntoward the more lucrative private sector, and the tenure-based promotions common at state\nenterprises can conceal their best internal talent.\nYet there is hope. Some state-owned enterprises in emerging markets are closing the gap with\ntheir private-sector competitors. Petronas, the state-owned energy company in Malaysia, for\nexample, began an operational-excellence campaign focusing on improved technical capabilities\nand a more effective working culture at its plants. After five years, the initiative delivered\nupward of $1 billion in savings and new revenues. The firm\u2019s operational effectiveness, judged\nby combining utilisation, quality, and performance, is now in the industry\u2019s top quartile.\nWhile these better-performing companies draw from well-known best practices in the\nprivate sector, they also concentrate on three areas of specific importance in the public\nsector: clarifying objectives and securing an explicit mandate, focusing scarce resources on\nareas with the highest financial impact, and redefining the talent proposition. Governments\nplay a big role in creating the right environment for state-owned enterprises to excel, but\ntheir chief executives can implement such moves without waiting for other officials to act.\nSource: Budiman, A., Lin, D., and Singham, S.

How is government coming to the rescue of state-owned enterprises?\n2. What are the threats affecting public sector employees?\n3. What are the key result areas public-owned companies attempting to improve\nperformance?\n4. How can effective financial plans address the problems facing public companies?\nForecasting\nA forecast is an approximation of what will likely occur in the foreseeable future. The\nobjective of forecasting is to provide a basis on which to measure differences between\nactual events and the plan that was adopted to achieve certain objectives. Thus, forecasts\nprovide management with a sound basis for action as the future unfolds and events begin\nto diverge from the predictions. Problems can be identified quickly and the nature and\nextent of corrective actions clearly defined.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n116699 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nThe notion that forecasting is impossible in the public sector is furthermost from the truth.\nThe cash requirements of government are based on budgeted expenditures, which are finite\nand known in advance. Revenues are tax-based and, therefore, estimable. Public organisations\nmust develop reliable estimates of their cash flow positions to maximise returns on their\nfinancial assets.8\nSome terminology linked with public sector finance\nMaster Budget\nA master budget is a set of interconnected budgets of sales, production costs, purchases,\nand incomes. and it also includes pro-forma financial statements. A budget is a plan of\nfuture financial transactions. A master budget serves as planning and control tool to the\nmanagement since they can plan the business activities during the period on the basis of\nmaster budget. At the end of each period, actual results can be compared with the master\nbudget and needed control actions can be taken.9\nIncremental budgeting\nIncremental budgeting is the traditional budgeting method whereby the budget is prepared\nby taking the current period\u2019s budget or actual performance as a base, with incremental\namounts then being added for the new budget period. These incremental amounts will\ninclude adjustments for things such as inflation, or planned increases in sales prices and\ncosts. Students often misapprehend one of incremental budgeting\u2019s biggest disadvantages is\nit disallows inflation. Of course it does; by definition, an \u2018increment\u2019 is an increase of some\nkind. The current year\u2019s budget or actual performance is a starting point only.10\nZero-Base Budgeting\nZero-Base Budgeting promises to move the organisation away from incremental budgeting,\nwhere last year\u2019s budget is the starting point. Instead, the starting point becomes zero, with\nthe implication past patterns of spending are no longer taken as a given. To deliver on this\npromise, the organisation is first divided up into \u2018decision units\u2019 \u2013 the lowest level at which\nbudget decisions are made. Decision units could be formed along functional or organisational\nlines \u2013 for example, a division of a department is a common decision unit, but programs\ncould be used as well. Managers in each decision unit then prepare a detailed description\nand evaluation of all activities it performs, including alternatives to current service delivery\nmethods and the spending plans to achieve the decision unit\u2019s goals.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n170 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nPriority Budgeting\nUnder this system, the government first determines how much revenue it has available, then\nidentifies the community\u2019s most important priorities and allocates resources to the priorities\nrather than directly to departments, and then ranks programs according to how well they\nalign with the priorities. Priority budgeting provides a transparent, structured approach\nfor allocating funding both between and in departments by directly funding priorities and\nprogrammes, rather than departments \u2013 once programmes have been funded, departmental\nbudgets reflect the total of all approved programs by department. Hence, the budget is\nbalanced rationally and strategically rather than arbitrarily.\nTarget-based Budgeting\nTarget-based Budgeting places a greater premium on revenue forecasting to set a viable\ntarget up front and also tell departments how much extra is available for funding decision-\npackages. Departments submit decision-packages to request funding for activities they cannot\nfit within target spending \u2013 either continuation of existing services or entirely new services.\nDepartments also prioritise their decision packages, but they are often guided in what\ndecision-packages to propose and prioritise by a set of organisation-wide goals distributed\nby central management.11\nCapital Rationing\nIt can be defined as a process of distributing available capital among the various investment\nproposals in such a manner the firm achieves maximum increase in its value.\nTypes of Capital Rationing\nBased on the source of restriction imposed on the capital, the capital rationing is divided\ninto two types namely hard capital rationing and soft capital rationing.\nSoft Capital Rationing: It is when the restriction is imposed by the management.\nHard Capital Rationing: It is when the capital infusion is limited by external sources.\nCapital rationing decisions by managers are made to attain the optimum utilisation of the\navailable capital. It is not wrong to say all investments with positive net present value should\nbe accepted but at the same time the ground reality prevails the availability of capital is\nlimited. The option of achieving the best is ruled out and therefore rational approach is to\nmake most out of the on hand capital.12\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n171 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nReturn on Capital Employed\nThe return on capital employed (ROCE) ratio, expressed as a percentage, complements\nthe return on equity (ROE) ratio by adding a company\u2019s debt liabilities, or funded debt,\nto equity to reflect a company\u2019s total \u2018capital employed\u2019. This measure narrows the focus\nto gain a better understanding of a company\u2019s ability to generate returns from its available\ncapital base.\nBy comparing net income to the sum of a company\u2019s debt and equity capital, investors can get\na clear picture of how the use of leverage impacts a company\u2019s profitability. Financial analysts\nconsider the ROCE measurement to be a more comprehensive profitability indicator because\nit gauges management\u2019s ability to generate earnings from a company\u2019s total pool of capital.\nReturn on Investment\nA performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the\nefficiency of a number of different investments. ROI measures the amount of return on\nan investment relative to the investment\u2019s cost. To calculate ROI, the benefit (or return)\nof an investment is divided by the cost of the investment, and the result is expressed as a\npercentage or a ratio. In the above formula, \u2018Gain from Investment\u2019 refers to the proceeds\nobtained from the sale of the investment of interest.13\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n117722 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nThe basic steps in budget preparation systems in government14\nIn principle, the basic steps in a standard budget preparation system comprise the following:\nThe first step in budget preparation should be the determination of a macroeconomic\nframework for the budget year \u2013 and ideally at least the next two years. The macroeconomic\nprojections, prepared by a macroeconomic unit in the ministry of finance or elsewhere,\nshould be agreed with the minister of finance. This allows the budget department within\nthe ministry of finance to determine the global level of expenditure can be afforded without\nadverse macroeconomic implications, given expected revenues and the level of deficit can\nbe safely financed.\nThe second step should be the allocation of this global total among line ministries, leaving\nroom for reserves (a separate planning and a contingency reserve as explained below) to be\nmanaged by the ministry of finance.\nThe next step should be for the budget department to prepare a budget circular given to\nline ministries, with the indicative aggregate spending ceiling for each ministry, on how\nto prepare their estimates which should be consistent with macro objectives. This circular\nwill include information on the economic assumptions to be adopted on wage levels,\nthe exchange rate and price levels \u2013 and preferably differentiated price levels for different\neconomic categories of goods and services.\nStep four is the submission of bids by line ministries to the budget department. Once\nreceived there needs to be an effective \u2018challenge\u2019 capacity within the budget department\nto test the costing of existing and any new policy proposals.\nThe next step comprises the negotiations, at official and then bilateral or collective ministerial\nlevel, leading finally to agreement.\nPoints\nA key concern for the public organisation is the need to manage finances in the most efficient\nand effective way. By relying on heavy budgets, the public sector is a heavy consumer of\nfinances and care is ensured money is spent in the most accurate manner.\nPublic financial management is absolutely critical to improving the quality of public service\noutcomes. It affects how funding is used to address national and local priorities, the availability\nof resources for investment and the cost-effectiveness of public services.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n173 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nA fundamental requirement of every government is to manage its finances at the\naggregate level.\nFor many countries achieving fiscal sustainability has become an increasing challenge over\nthe last two years when faced with bailing out major financial institutions.\nFinancial management has a significant role in the operational management of the day-to-\nday activities of government.\nThe accounting system should provide a whole system of fiduciary controls. This comprises:\nInternal controls within an organisation and Internal audit \u2013 the oversight system established\nby the management.\nTransparency includes all of published budgets, financial statements and audit reports as\nwell as other financial information published by government.\nGovernment prepares the budget for fulfilling certain objectives. The various objectives of\ngovernment budget are: reallocation of resource, reducing inequalities in income and wealth,\neconomic stability and economic growth.\nThe public sector uses performance-based metrics in their budgeting processes, and this\npractice has become more common today.\nA master budget is a set of interconnected budgets of sales, production costs, purchases,\nand incomes. and it also includes pro-forma financial statements.\nIncremental budgeting is the traditional budgeting method whereby the budget is prepared\nby taking the current period\u2019s budget or actual performance as a base, with incremental\namounts then being added for the new budget period.\nZero-Base Budgeting promises to move the organisation away from incremental budgeting,\nwhere last year\u2019s budget is the starting point. The starting point becomes zero, with the\nimplication past patterns of spending are no longer taken as a given.\nTarget-based Budgeting places a greater premium on revenue forecasting to set a viable target\nup front and also tell departments how much extra is available for funding decision-packages.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n174 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor finanCial management\nQuestions\n1.

Viewed from this perspective,\nrecruitment and selection collectively represents one of the most important HR practices.\nGiven the difficulties the public service experience in attracting persons of the desired quality\nto its employment, it is of the utmost importance its recruitment and selection processes\nyield the desired results by ensuring the most suitable candidates are appointed to posts.\nTo arrive at the selection of the most suitable candidate, all procedures that have preceded\nthe choice of the candidate, including advertisement, shortlisting and the development\nof appropriate selection criteria, must have been diligently thought through and applied\nconsistently under set national prescripts and norms.\nGiven the link between good quality recruitment and service delivery, its importance is\nparamount. The effectiveness of recruitment and selection is in itself dependent on the quality\nof HR planning, proper job descriptions and staffing requirements dictated by transformation\nand service delivery objectives. If these areas are neglected, this will inevitably spill over into\nthe area of recruitment and selection, setting off an ever-increasing vicious circle.1\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n177 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nPrinciples of public sector recruitment and selection2\nRecruitment and selection in the public service are essentially concerned with finding,\nassessing and engaging new employees or promoting existing ones. As such, its focus is\non matching the capabilities and interests of prospective candidates with the demands and\nrewards of a given job. Recruitment and selection decisions are amongst the most important\nof all decisions managers must make as they are a prerequisite to the development of an\neffective workforce.\nIt should be noted recruitment is only one aspect of human resource management. It needs\nto be underpinned by a clear linking of the objectives and strategy of the organisation to the\njobs people are asked to do. It should be supported by properly evaluated human resource\nmanagement systems, such as resource management, training and development programmes,\ncareer progression, performance management, health and safety and welfare issues.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n117788 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nThe principles are:\n- Probity-Appointments are made on correctness and fairness.\n- Appointments made on merit.\n- An appointments process in line with best practice.\n- A fair appointments process applied with consistency.\n- Appointments made in an open, accountable and transparent manner.\nJob descriptions and person specifications\nAccurate job descriptions and person specifications are essential for public sector recruitment.\nThey should:\n- provide the relevant criteria against which candidates can be measured throughout\nthe selection process and which can be justified under relevant legislation;\n- provide valuable information to ensure that selection techniques and tools are\ncustomised to reflect the requirements of the job;\n- generate good quality information which will help assessors decide better.\nSelection\nThe selection process should be designed to assess the skills and criteria determined in the\njob description and person specification. Deciding which methods are most appropriate for\na given situation often involves finding the right balance between the ideal approach and\nthe money and time available.\nThere are many different selection situations, from internal promotions to selecting candidates\nfrom the open market. In all cases the objective is to choose a high quality selection procedure\nbased on the skills/competencies relevant to the job. This section outlines some of the most\ncommonly used selection techniques, including:\n- Application forms & Curriculum Vitae\n- Psychometric tests and work sample tests\n- Interviews\n- Personality questionnaires\n- Assessment centres\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n179 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nAttracting the right candidates\nWhether the process is advertised internally or externally, the aim at this stage is to attract\nhigh quality and suitable applicants to increase the chances of ultimately finding the right\nperson for the job. Recruiters should ensure advertisements are equality and diversity friendly\nand promote highest levels of fairness and probity.\nIn many countries, programmes for the renewal of the public sector have been launched.\nThe objectives are to increase efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility as well as to improve\nquality in the public sector according to the needs of the national economy and the growing\nexpectations of citizens. Some countries have expressed visions of becoming an employer of\nchoice, or an ideal employer or, to be particularly attractive to young people, a model IT\nuser. These are considered key factors in competing for young and well-trained labour, as\nwell as in retaining staff and preventing outflow to the private sector.\nApplications and shortlisting\nThe decisions made at short-listing are crucial as they eliminate some candidates from\nthe selection process. Short-listing should be done in a careful and systematic manner by\nconsidering each application and evaluating it against relevant criteria.\nThe traditional approach to applying for jobs in the public sector is to complete a fairly\nlengthy application form. This may be off-putting for some candidates. Therefore, application\nforms, if used, should only address the really important areas to allow shortlisting to take\nplace. The benefit of using an application form from the organisation\u2019s perspective is it\nensures the same information is gained from candidates which helps to achieve a level of\nconsistency in the short-listing process.\nInterview\nStructured interviews are the most effective type of interview. The interview process is formed\nthrough identification of the key requirements of the job and a list of questions is drawn up.\nA panel of interviewers works through each set of questions with each candidate and scores\nthem on their answers. At the end of the interview process the overall scores are considered\nand the best candidate chosen. If additional selection methods are chosen this is fed into\nthe overall process at the end and again the best-fit candidate is offered the appointment.3\nEven where the interview is structured, this does not mean follow up questions cannot be\nasked to probe more deeply into a candidate\u2019s skills and experience. An interview which\ndoes not do this, but instead sticks to a rigid list of questions, will not allow the interviewer\nto obtain the information required to make a proper decision.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n180 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nMembers involved in the interview process should be trained in interviewing skills and the\nsorts of questions they should or should not ask.\nReferences, medicals and other checks\nThese may include a medical/health check to ensure the prospective employee is capable of\ndoing the job in the foreseeable future, a character check and assessment of their eligibility\nto work in this State.\nAlthough a candidate\u2019s skills may have been objectively tested through a range of assessment\nmethods, the accuracy of some of the information supplied by the candidate must be\nindependently verified. This section includes details on these checks and concludes with\ninformation on Certificates of Appointment.4\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n118811 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nCase Study: Challenges in public sector recruitment5\nPublic sector organisations face significant staffing challenges. Many report they are only\nadequately staffed. And an increasing number report they are grossly understaffed in critical\nareas. Human Resource professionals\u2019 training and expertise must be utilised to the fullest\nextent to address these challenges. Human Resource\u2019s importance to the overall success\nof an organisation should not be underestimated. Further, the constant push to do more\nwith less means many employees are now wearing more hats in taking on responsibilities\noutside their core area. All of these issues contribute to the mounting pressure on Human\nResource to find and attract the right person for the right position as quickly as possible.\nNecessity is the mother of invention, or in this context, the mother of innovation as many\nresponding organisations aptly exemplify in their varied approaches to recruiting. At the\nsame time, the study findings indicate there are things Human Resource could be doing as\nan organisation to see improvements in all Human Resource functions.\nMany public sector organisations continue to work without any type of thoughtful, proactive,\nstrategic plan for Human Resource Management, recruiting, and staffing. Much can be\ninferred from the lack of a guiding plan. Many organisations are struggling to simply deliver\nregular services and complete daily transactional activities to keep the organisation going.\nIf management does not see Human Resource Management as providing value or being an\nasset to the organisation, there may be little impetus to take time away from critical activities\nto complete a formal plan. A systematic internal review as part of a planning process,\nhowever, is essential to identify what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not in terms of current processes,\nprocedures and services. Business process improvement depends on first understanding the\ncurrent state and locating areas with potential for improvement.\nAn effective strategic plan and the priorities and improvements this plan details can drive\nthe collection of more accurate and reliable information. Better information and data will\nallow Human Resource to act more strategically and have the evidence to justify decisions\nor new directions. Without a strategic plan, Human Resource Management may not be\ncollecting the right information or the data to evaluate recruitment strategies properly.\nNumerous organisations cited the strategies or programmes are working well for recruiting\nand staffing. Further exploration would likely demonstrate many organisations have only\nanecdotal evidence on the success of these solutions rather than hard data. Accurate and timely\ninformation is essential for organisations looking to move away from certain transactional\ntasks to more strategic activities.\nSource: Davidson, G., Lepeak, S., and Newman, E.

Analyse the issues that contribute to the mounting pressure on public sector\nrecruitment.\n2. What is the relevance of a human resource plan for effective public sector recruitment?\n3. What flaws might exist if human resource plans are not properly defined in the\nrecruitment practice?\nRecruiters in the public sector\nTo be successful in the government and public sector, recruitment specialists must possess\nan unparalleled understanding of the ins-and-outs of the government talent acquisition\nprocess. In addition, delivery of recruitment services to this sector is further complicated by\nthe need to balance role-based skills, departmental or divisional needs, and agency-specific\nrequirements.\nRecruitment and selection processes in the government and public sector also tend to be\nmore complex than in the private sector, requiring a complex documentation set to be\ncomplied and submitted for each candidate offered for a particular role. Recruiters also need\nto be very mindful of interview and referencing processes, and must ensure candidates are\nadequately prepared and briefed before starting the process.\nGovernment and public sector recruitment specialists must be well versed in placement\nprocesses insisted on by government agencies. Often requiring specific documentation sets\nfor each applicant and role, recruiters need to prepare documents such as formal application\nforms, selection criteria, statement of claims, and referee reports. This requires a heavy\ntime commitment from the recruitment consultant as they meet, select, and prepare\ncandidates, create and submit formal applications, and brief candidates for the interview\nand selection process.6\nInternal recruitment in the public sector\nExternal recruitment may at times be avoided by implementing re-structuring / re-organisation\nof work or by re-engineering work processes, or internally by giving underutilised existing\nhuman resources re-training or re-skilling programmes to maximise their potential.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n183 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nAn internal recruitment strategy is characterised by promoting employees from within an\norganisation to fill upcoming positions. Many firms use such devices as job posting boards,\nemail flashes, intranet posts and flyers to advise existing employees of positions they may\nvie for. This recruitment may be in the form of creating and shuffling temporary teams\nto fill certain tasks or may be permanent changes. Internal recruitment may be primarily\nhorizontal or it may be for promotions in which the promoted employee\u2019s former position\nmay not be filled. Internal recruitment is also practised by governments with the objective of\nproviding opportunities to employees from the inside to secure better changes of promotion\nand career advancement.\nRevitalisation\nWhen new positions open within the public sector, managers have the opportunity to bring\nin new candidates who offer a different point of view from the existing staff. When public\nexecutives recruit internally, they are working with the same set of ideas you had when\nthe process started. Internal recruiting has a way of limiting the flow of new ideas into a\ncompany can help to spur growth and development.7\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n118844 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nCompetition\nInternal recruitment can offer incentive for employees to perform well in public jobs, but\nit also can create an atmosphere of competition that can be counterproductive. Employees\nmay feel pressured to compete with each other to be considered for a position during an\ninternal recruitment process, and this can create conflict. While the potential is there to\nimprove morale with internal recruitment, it could turn the other way and help to lower\nmorale because employees become focused on competing for jobs rather than trying to\nbecome proficient at their current positions.\nHeadhunting in the public sector\nAn important consideration for public sector management is retaining high calibre staff to\nundertake big challenges posed by ministries. In this context, public bodies will be first\nto source executives from inside with the intention such people need to move to a higher\nposition and be rewarded for the effort they undertook for years.\nWhile this internal recruitment practice is highly sought in the public service, ministers and\nheads of department might not find out the driving force for their organisation. They will\nneed to recruit highly qualified officials either from the private sector or from international\ncompanies or probably overseas governments where such people have excelled in their\nfields. Developing nations with minimum local resources will have to consider headhunting\nas a means of having top talent to work in the local public sector and bring about the\ndesired change.\nIt is for this reason executive search or headhunting might be duly considered in countries\nwhere ongoing developments cannot be undertaken by the local people since they might never\nhave been exposed to forthcoming challenges and might lack the desired competences to bring\ninnovation and change, and even set the public sector on the path of a major breakthrough.\nHead hunters\u2019 traditional approach8\nWhen an executive position has to be filled within the public service, a specialist executive\nsearch agency will be approached and advised on the requirements of the role, before they\nidentify prospective targets.\nExecutive head-hunters search the business world to find an ideal candidate from a similar\norganisation in the industry. They will use all their contacts in an attempt to find the\nideal candidate. It can be a lengthy, costly process as they narrow down the field, make an\napproach, and then wait for the right answer.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n185 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nRisks of traditional headhunting\nThere are no guaranteed results from a prolonged headhunting process. Even with a vast\namount of work, a candidate might refuse a job due to the risk of changing position, a\npoor negotiation strategy, or they may even receive a counter offer from another company.\nA failure at the final stage could mean the entire process must begin again. Even if the\nright person is found, an executive at this level typically has a three-month notice period,\ncreating further delays. The scope of the traditional headhunting process is narrow, limiting\nthe prospective candidates to those already within a similar position within the industry.\nThere is a far more flexible alternative.\nNeed for outstanding leaders\nThe need for outstanding leaders in the public and not-for-profit sectors is greater than ever.\nFor public organisations and government bodies, the need to recruit and retain effective\nleaders is fundamental to maintaining complex and bureaucratic organisations in an era of\npolitical instability and increasing public scrutiny. For non-profit organisations, the focus is\non securing leaders with the skills to professionalise and develop their organisations, whilst\ndriving towards their institutional objectives.9\nThere are enormous needs of the right resources for the corporate firms. The retention\npolicies of these companies also herald the need to hire a resource for a specialist role who\ncan serve for a long time. The challenges companies face is the inability of in-house HR\nteams in finding the right avenues will enable them to the right employees. To address this,\nit is essential to think of outsourcing these services to a firm who is capable of providing\nquality resources and meeting the business requirement.\nSelected areas in public service seeking executives\nThe table highlights a few selected areas where it is deemed public sector executives are\nimportant in bringing their contribution to the development of priority sectors through the\nhigh level of competence and strategic thought and intents they might have.\nArea of Expertise Type of contribution from executives\nEducation Education remains a priority for many countries. To combat illiteracy\nand ensure high levels of human development, executives, either\nlocal or international have the desired competence to come forward\nwith proposals like quality training, national certification framework,\ndevelopment of secondary and tertiary education and leveraging of\nresources to develop high performing staff in the education sector.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n186 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nInfrastructure Infrastructure development is of paramount importance to govern-\nments worldwide. Experts in project management can come forward\nwith bright ideas onto how to develop new infrastructure and premises\nwithin the deadlines and the budget allocated. The opening of railway\nlines, the development of smart cites certainly require the need to\nrecruit high calibre executives.\nPolicy planning Executive search might be every important in this particular area\nwhereby projects are launched by the government like the development\nof health centres, IT incubation centres, and e-government. These\npolicies are in line with improving services provided to a country\u2019s\ncitizens. The capability of translating policies to reality might depend\nupon the competence of top executives.\nFinancial planning and Monetary policies, creation of stable financial instruments, manage-\ngovernance ment of risks, revamping economic growth could be key result areas\nexpected in the public services. Executives as transformational leaders\nunderstand the need to develop sound financial plans for their minis-\ntries while these align with the expectations of stakeholders and the\npublic. In this perspective, even mechanisms for good governance to\nensure the best use of funds is required. This depends evidently on\nthe expert knowledge available from top executives.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n118877 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nHealth sector This is another key sector of public economies in several countries. The\nneed to have a sound workforce free from health problems is utopia\nbut there could be efforts to better address health issues. Headhunted\nmanagers come forward with programmes to alleviate stress in public\nsector jobs, reduce sedentary tasks, develop positive attitudes to\npersonal healthcare, launch programmes to combat workplace related\nhealth impairments.\nSecondment as internal public sector recruitment10\nSecondment means the transfer, on loan, of a member of staff of a department to another\nbody, for a specific time period, generally to carry out specific work. Typically, secondment\ncould arise where, by virtue of the special skills and experience of a member of staff of\na department, another body or agency, may seek to have that person work for them in\nrelation to a specific project. Or, a member of staff, in furtherance of his or her career\ndevelopment, may identify an opportunity in another body or agency which she would\nlike to pursue for a specific period of time. In such circumstances, whether initiated by the\nbody concerned or the person in question, the decision if secondment can be facilitated\nwill lie with the Department.\nSecondments can be a useful, effective way to make sure an organisation has the right\ncapabilities at the right time. They also have the additional benefits of: reduced time to\nrecruit, reduced cost of recruiting, and the development and engagement of employees.\nConditions to fulfil during public sector secondment\nFor a secondment to occur all three parties must agree: the employee, the home organisation\nand the receiving organisation. A transfer occurs as a consequence of an agreement between\nthe heads of the relinquishing organisation and the receiving organisation. While desirable,\nthe employee does not necessarily play a role in establishing the agreement.\nCertain general conditions apply:11\n- A secondment is established with the agreement of the employee.\n- The duration of the secondment is by agreement between the home organisation, the\nreceiving organisation and the employee. Most employers would set a 12-month limit.\n- A breach of the Code is an exception that may lead to the early termination\nof a secondment.\n- The role the employee returns to depends on the current and future needs of the\nhome organisation.\n- All return arrangements should be documented before the start of the secondment.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n188 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT reCruitment in the PubliC seCtor\nThe conditions for contract employment in the Public Service\nCreating any new human resource policy, system, or procedure must conform to general and\nspecific principles enunciated by the organisation and must enhance existing practices. The\nprimary motive for the development of the new policy and guidelines to regulate contract\nemployment in the Public Service is the need to provide on a timely basis the competencies\nneeded by Ministries and Departments of Government. This will ensure their optimal\nperformance and the realisation of their and the country\u2019s development goals.\nThe employment of persons to serve on contract obtains principally in the following\nsituations:12\n- Where there is a dearth of suitable candidates for permanent appointment to\npensionable offices in the public service and there is urgent need for the services\nattaching to such offices.\n- Where special projects or programmes of specified duration (often funded by\ninternational agencies) are undertaken by Ministries/Departments and need to\nbe executed and monitored by personnel additional to those on the permanent\nestablishment of the Ministry/Department involved.\n- Where a need has been identified for the specialised services of a person, like an\nAdvisor in a particular area of expertise \u2013 and such need cannot be met by the\nfilling of any existing position on the establishment.\nTransfer in the public sector13\nA transfer or other movement of an employee to other duties in the department or to duties\nin another agency (including a transfer or movement at the initiative of the employee or\nbecause of an application for an advertised position) is at the same classification level as the\nemployee. Such a transfer or movement does not constitute a resignation.\nAn employee may be administratively transferred to another position without the position\nbeing advertised where a delegate directs an employee be re-assigned at level. An ongoing\nemployee transferred to a fixed-term position must be paid not less than their substantive\nsalary.

An initial definition could be the\nprovision of various services, benefits and facilities offered to employees by the employers.\nThe welfare measures need not be monetary but might exist in any kind/forms. These include\nitems such as allowances, housing, transportation, medical insurance and food. Employee\nwelfare also embraces monitoring of working conditions, creation of industrial harmony\nthrough infrastructure for health, industrial relations and insurance against disease, accident\nand unemployment for the workers and their families. Through such generous benefits the\nemployer makes life worth living for employee.1\nWelfare includes anything done for employees\u2019 comfort and improvement and is provided\nover and above the wages. Welfare helps in keeping the morale and motivation of the\nemployees high so as to retain the employees for longer duration. The welfare measures\nneed not be in monetary terms only but in any kind or forms. Employee welfare includes\nmonitoring of working conditions, creation of industrial harmony through infrastructure\nfor health, industrial relations and insurance against disease, accident and unemployment\nfor the workers and their families.2\nEmployee welfare entails all employer activities which direct towards providing employees\nwith certain facilities and services in addition to wages or salaries. The very logic behind\nproviding welfare schemes is to create an efficient, healthy, loyal, and satisfied labour force\nfor the organisation. The purpose of providing such facilities is to make their work life\nbetter and to raise their standard of living.3\nEmployee welfare\u2019s importance\nIt would be useful here to mention the importance of employee welfare in the public service.\nIn a general sense, employee welfare aims at motivating the public officer to become more\neffective at work. Welfare also addresses the need for better work-life balance thereby reducing\nstress and creating more harmony. These elements are discussed in the next paragraph.\nMotivating public officers\nMotivating public officials is crucial for public service sector effectiveness. And as the public\nservice sector is a key pillar of international development, public service motivation is critical\nto achieving the goals of international development. Further, to produce effective and lasting\nreforms, there must be an internal desire to change, and motivated public officials are best\nplaced to lead.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n194 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nPublic services are constrained in their ability to compete financially with the private\nsector for top talent. But it may not actually be in their best strategic, long-term interests\nto compete on those terms. While the abilities of public and private sector employees to\nachieve organisational outcomes can be similar, top private sector talent may not possess\nthe intrinsic motivation necessary to sustain good performance in top public sector roles.\nThe public sector will always lag the private sector in terms of remuneration. Resources\nwill always be a limiting factor, and the vagaries of human nature make the management,\nlet alone the motivation, of staff challenging in the best of conditions. The examples and\nprinciples described here are not intended to be comprehensive; instead, they seek to offer\ninspiration, insight and instruction for public service leaders and managers. They should\nserve as a starting point on the ongoing journey to improve motivation in the public service.4\nCreating better work life balance\nIn today\u2019s fast paced business world, the ability to achieve work life balance is becoming\nmore and more difficult. Employers expect more from staff, and people are increasingly\nputting additional pressure on themselves to achieve greater results. Maintaining work life\nbalance is not only important for one\u2019s personal health and relationships, but it can also\nimprove the efficiency of his work performance.5\nThe negative effects of a burnout impact every area of a worker\u2019s life, including his personal\nand social life. Work life balance is important as it allows the employee separate work\nand home, meaning the stress of work should stay at work, and not follow her outside of\noffice hours.\nWith a balance between work and home, comes greater control of where the employee\u2019s\nfocus remains. If the employee leaves his work at the office, his full attention will be on his\nhome life and giving his relationships the attention in which they deserve.\nHealthline Company explains \u2018stress can cause a variety of symptoms and can affect your\noverall health and wellbeing\u2019, from less serious conditions such as flu, to more serious\nhealth issues such as respiratory or digestive problems. Either way, stress can impact your\nhealth so much is even more of a reason as to why maintaining a healthy work life balance\nis important. Taking the time to look after oneself by exercising, eating well, and relaxing\ncan contribute to limiting one\u2019s health problems and make us more efficient workers during\nbusiness hours.6\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n195 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nEmployee welfare measures\u2019 benefits\nEmployee welfare measures provide better physical and mental health to workers and thus\npromote a healthy work environment.\nFacilities like housing schemes, medical benefits, and education and recreation facilities for\nworker\u2019s families help in raising their standards of living. This makes workers to pay more\nattention towards work and thus increases their productivity.\nEmployers get stable labour force by providing welfare facilities. Workers take active interest\nin their jobs and work with a feeling of involvement and participation.\nEmployee welfare measures increase the productivity of organisation and promote healthy\nindustrial relations thereby maintaining industrial peace.\nThe social evils prevalent among the labours such as substance abuse. are reduced to a greater\nextent by the welfare policies.7\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n119966 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nPensions as a core element of employee welfare\nPensions as a form of social security against old-age poverty and other uncertainties have\nattracted great interest virtually everywhere in the world, both in developed and developing\ncountries, in recent times. Pension programmes, especially those that are publicly financed\nand administered, have become an issue of concern to economists, policymakers and the\npublic. This is not only because such programmes are central to the well-being of pensioners\nand the elderly, but also because the majority of pension programmes are not actuarially\nbalanced (that is they are not financially stable), and as such they are run at deficits, thus\nmaking the present values of their future liabilities to be enormous. To this end, an overview\nof what a pension programme/scheme entails is needed for a general understanding of this\nform of social security service.8\nA pension scheme is a transfer programme that serves as a channel for redistributing\nincome to the elderly or retirees, after a stipulated number of service years. A pension is\na regular payment made by the government or by private companies or organisations to\ntheir retirees as a form of social security against old-age risks and uncertainties. In some\ncountries, especially those that are economically advanced, pensions are extended to other\ncategories of people apart from retirees, such as widows, orphans, disabled people (in the\nform of disability pensions), and the elderly or the aged.9 Pension programmes are put in\nplace to serve as protection for the elderly and retirees against old-age risks, poverty, and\nother uncertainties. In addition, they are also used to promote a \u2018saving culture\u2019 among\ncurrent employees, and this stimulates savings.10\nEducation as welfare for adult development\nThe economics of formal education has until now been focused on the cost side as inputs\nin the formal system have been easy to measure. Even in workplace training models, the\nfocus has been on formal learning only. Formal learning, leading to certification, is based\non criteria of selection and exclusion. These approaches are unlikely to survive unchanged\nin a knowledge society. The cost of financing work-related adult learning will have to be\nrevaluated as a diversity of learning styles and non-traditional learning environments has\nbeen neglected by formal educational policies.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n197 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nNew factors are calling for a shift in the vision of adult learning, with greater emphasis on:\n- experiential and contextual learning that relates to work, the home, and community;\n- use of technology, especially in the area of distance learning;\n- support for continued research and development in effective work-related adult\nlearning practices;\n- professional development and training;\n- outcome-based measurement of adult learning, in addition to inputs;\n- widening the recognition of competencies to all areas of learning.\nAll these are expected to promote more cost-effective learning. The recognition of non-\nformal competencies is beneficial to the applicant in that it increases the opportunities for\nemployment. It also promotes social recognition and inclusion, and increases competency\nas a citizen, and family member.11\nInsight: Different Categories of Labour Welfare\nSome of the major categories of labour welfare are: intra-mural facilities, extra-mural facilities,\nstatutory facilities, mutual facilities, and voluntary facilities. It is very difficult to classify\nthe welfare activities into certain broad categories.12\nIntra-mural facilities\nThe facilities provided inside the factory are known as intra-mural facilities. These facilities\ninclude activities relating to minimisation of industrial fatigue, provision of safety measures\nlike fencing and covering of machines, good layout of the plant and machinery, sufficient\nlighting conditions, and providing first aid. Provisions of such facilities are also obligatory\nin all industrial establishments all over the world.\nExtra-mural facilities\nFacilities offered to the workers outside the factory are known as extra-mural facilities.\nThey include better housing accommodations, indoor and outdoor recreation sports, and\neducational facilities. The provision of these facilities is voluntary. Earlier, due attention was\nnot given to the provision of extra-mural facilities to the workers but now it is realised such\nfacilities are very important for the general welfare and uplifting of the workers.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n198 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nStatutory facilities\nUnder this category, welfare facilities are provided according to the labour legislations passed\nby the Government. The nature and coverage of these facilities vary from country to country.\nAgain these facilities may be either intra-mural facilities or extra-mural facilities. These\nfacilities must be provided by each employer and must not be ignored. Any contravention\nof the statutory provisions shall render the employer punishable under the Act concerned.\nThe National Commission of Labour has divided all the statutory measures under two\ndistinct heads:\n- Facilities which have to be provided irrespective of the size of the establishment,\nsuch as drinking water.\n- Facilities which are to be provided subject to the employment of a specified number\nof persons, like cr\u00e8ches.\nMutual facilities\nThese facilities are outside the scope of the statutory facilities. These activities are voluntarily\nundertaken by the workers themselves for their own interest. As such the employer has no\nsay in it.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n119999 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nVoluntary facilities\nThe facilities which are voluntarily provided by the employers come under this category.\nHence these are not statutory. No doubt, the activities under this category ultimately lead\nto increase in the efficiency of workers.\nHealth and well-being at work\nMaintaining health and well-being should be high-priority for workers and employers alike.\nHealth is an asset closely associated with a person\u2019s quality of life and longevity, as well as\ntheir ability to work. A healthy economy depends on a healthy workforce; organisations\nlose productivity through ill-health of their workers.\nThe health, safety and well-being of workers are a priority for EU policy. The EU, through\nDirective 89/391/EEC on measures to improve the safety and health of workers, places an\nexplicit responsibility on the employer to adapt work to the person, while the Europe 2020\nstrategy seeks to ensure all people \u2013 including those with different health capacities \u2013 Acan\nwork for pay.13\nHealth and well-being in the workplace is a broader issue than exposure to risks, accidents\nand occupational diseases; it is the outcome of a multitude of settings and conditions.\nOrganisations and workers need a range of resources to ensure health and well-being in the\nworkplace; how work is organised and the organisational culture are also important. Physical\nrisks, being the most visible, originally received the most attention; however, psychosocial\nrisks are receiving increasing prominence as a workplace health hazard.\nInsight: Healthcare reform in the United States14\nFor American companies to remain competitive in the long run, managers must shift from the\ntraditional benefits-management approach to comprehensive control of health care delivery.\nAt the core of this new paradigm is the recognition health care costs are a fundamental\ninvestment in employees as a long-term asset. A company secures human capital through\nits total compensation package, which includes wages, health care benefits, pension benefits,\nworkmen\u2019s compensation, vacations, absenteeism, and sick leave. For the value of health\nbenefits to exceed their cost, a company must manage health care like any other important\ncomponent of production.\nThis issue was a major one developed by US President Barack Obama during his second\nmandate (2012\u20132016) with an intention of bringing in health welfare to Americans following\nthe 2008 financial crisis which led the leading nation to austerity. The proposal met with\nstrong resistance from employees and was not applied as expected into practice.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n200 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nRetirement benefits as a part of public sector welfare\nPensions remain the attractiveness of the public sector as an employer. Voluntary mobility\ncontributes to attractiveness. Private sector employees may wish to pursue positions in the\npublic sector if they are confident they can subsequently assume other private sector positions\nwithout loss of pension rights. Public sector staff are more likely to remain if they can see\nopportunities for advancement between public sector bodies with no pension disincentives.\nOccupational mobility is favoured more in a position-based employment system than in a\ncareer system, where there are constraints inherent in the public service system.\nIn a career system, people who join the civil service after their studies are expected to remain\nthere throughout their working lives and up until retirement. In a position-based system,\non the other hand, the official is recruited to occupy a specific post in government. She is\nrecruited for his or her skills, together with those required to fill the post for which she has\napplied. The employer assumes no responsibility for career management.15\nCase Study: Public welfare in the democratic process16\nPublic welfare is one way in which a basic principle of democracy finds practical application.\nThis is the principle the whole society is responsible in certain measure for each of its\nmembers. Public welfare, by its very nature, is allied with people and their needs. As a\ngovernmental service, public welfare today reaches into every county in America and is\nan accepted part of government. The American Public Welfare Association is composed of\npeople who make this service a living reality.\nDuring the decade and a half of its existence the Association has seen the realization of\nmany of its original ideals. It has witnessed the broadening of public knowledge of public\nwelfare, as well as the emergence of accepted standards of welfare administration. It is not\nsurprising, therefore, present tenets on which the Association\u2019s 1946 programme is based\nshould reach farther than the internal organisation of public welfare agencies to the role\nthese agencies play in our whole democratic system of government.\nToday, the trend toward the evolution of public welfare as a comprehensive and integral\nfunction of Government \u2013 Federal, state and local \u2013 embodies four basic factors.\nFirst: Public welfare represents a basic guarantee by government of minimum standards\nof human existence below which no one may be permitted to fall. This means no person should\nbe denied its benefits because of arbitrary concepts of eligibility in terms of residence,\ncategorical exclusion or regional economic inequalities. It means the acceptance of primary\nresponsibility by federal government for leadership and financial aid in behalf of people of\nthe entire nation, even while administrative responsibility remains in local hands.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n201 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nSecond: Public welfare is a comprehensive function in which economic aid and social services\nare as closely related as defy arbitrary segregation.\nThird: A comprehensive programme based on consistent policy can only be achieved through\nunified administration at all levels of government.\nFourth: Public welfare is a residual function and recognises the responsibility of government\nto utilise other primary means to assure security and social well-being.\nGrowth and change in public welfare, however, have been more marked than have been\nthe upheavals in other phases of our social and economic life. America has weathered its\ngreatest depression, has fought its most critical war, and now faces a future holding its\nrichest opportunities. Out of these unforgettable years has come our present definition of\npublic welfare\u2019s function in democracy. It is essential, therefore, public welfare in the post-\nwar period hold high human values. As the well-being of people is inherent to democracy,\nso the growth of welfare programs as an accepted governmental service is living proof our\nfaith in democracy is justified.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n220022 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nQuestions:\n1.

And sustained growth will not be achieved without successful attacks on\nissues of human welfare that constitute the soft underbelly of emerging market economies.\nThe litany of inter-related problems \u2013 poverty, inequality, ignorance, sickness, isolation \u2013\nrecited for over a century in high income countries, is familiar. As are opportunities to address\nthem through education, training, healthcare, social care, sanitation, housing, infrastructure.\nEvery emerging market has recognised the need to address its problems and capture opportunities\nto resolve them. Some have channelled growing prosperity in to giant improvements in\nhuman services. Others have relied less on the state and more on the market. Most have\nchosen hybrids. But very few emerging markets \u2013 or high income countries \u2013 have recognised\nthe need for joined-up policies to address different aspects of human welfare, for example\nyouth policies, ageing policies. Very few have recognised the need for coordinated action,\nfor instance healthcare, social care to address welfare issues. And very few have recognised\nthe value of life-course perspectives in policies and actions that address the age-specific needs\nof population cohorts, such as maternal nutrition.\nSolutions to problems of human welfare continue to evade wealthy countries that have\nhad time and resources to understand the issues and act on them. Given the challenges for\nemerging markets are vastly greater, it is not surprising many of them are unaddressed and\nunresolved and must be met in extraordinarily complex and rapidly changing conditions.\nInsofar as the benefits of growth are shared some will, at least in part, solve themselves.\nBut the problems will not melt. They constitute what may be the human history\u2019s most\nformidable agenda.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n203 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nIssues on Welfare State-The European public sector\nFor many in Europe, the values and norms that underpin the continent\u2019s social model are\nat the heart of what it means to be European.18\nWelfare states perform a number of redistributive functions and protect the vulnerable.\nContrary to negative portrayals, welfare states also invest in human and social capital. All\nEuropean citizens both use and contribute to the welfare state at different stages of their lives.\nPressures on public finances, and the burden that social spending imposes on the \u2018productive\u2019\nparts of economies, raise questions about whether European countries can still afford their\nwelfare states.\nWelfare systems first designed 50 or more years ago need to be recast to confront today\u2019s\nchallenges. They must accommodate the extensive societal transformations associated\nwith population ageing, closer global economic integration and the spill over effects of\nclimate change.\nWelfare states will also have to adapt to new social risks resulting from the changing nature\nof European economies, especially evolving patterns of work and employment. They will\nhave to use resources more efficiently and make the most of relevant technological advances,\nwithout unduly sacrificing key principles such as solidarity.\nA number of dilemmas about appropriate forms of decision-making and democratic oversight\nsurround efforts to reform welfare, but there are reasons to be optimistic about the future\nof the European social model. Well-designed welfare states can promote sustainable growth\nin Europe and be a competitive asset.\nSustaining Welfare State\nEvery time Governments subsidises any service or fully funds any welfare service the size of\nthe public sector grows. Often, it\u2019s just another bureaucracy headed for disaster, dissipating\nwealth as it goes. It\u2019s like aid provided to poverty-stricken countries by international\norganisations. By the time the aid reaches the targeted recipients, the initial size of the aid\nhas thinned out to a mere pittance. Bulk of the aid is eaten away by administrators and\nother intermediaries. The world had never seen a shrinking Welfare State until the start of\nthe 1990s when Sweden, a State with a very strong socialist bias, was per force required to\nmake sweeping welfare reforms due to budgetary pressures.19\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n204 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nThe Welfare State, as it evolved over the years since the 1970s, caused a rise in Government\u2019s\nshare of the national economy. This is not only because most Welfare State services are\nlabour-intensive activities but also due to a broadening of the scope of welfare spending.\nIs our expansive Welfare State fiscally sustainable? As long as the Government is willing\nto raise enough revenue for the financing of welfare spending the Welfare State is believed\nto be sustainable. It\u2019s an armchair view shared by many people. The will to impose higher\ntaxes is one thing; the State\u2019s capacity to raise revenue by means of taxation is another. The\nlatter is a function of the size of the economy. The willingness of the people to pay taxes\nis another significant variable in the equation. Should the size of the economy contract or\ngrow sluggishly and the willingness of the people to pay taxes falter due to, say, rampant\ncorruption, wasteful government expenditures, the Welfare State would become unsustainable\nover time.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n220055 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT emPloyee welfare in the PubliC seCtor\nPoints\nWelfare includes anything done for employees\u2019 comfort and improvement and is provided\nover and above wages.\nWelfare helps in keeping the morale and motivation of the employees high so as to retain\nthe employees for longer duration.\nMaintaining work life balance is not only important for one\u2019s personal health and relationships,\nbut can also improve the efficiency of his work performance.\nEmployee welfare measures provide better physical and mental health to workers and thus\npromote a healthy work environment.\nEmployers get stable labour force by providing welfare facilities.

To achieve these aims, training\nand learning are inevitably key issues that need to be addressed in the public service. It is\nso often argued high levels of performance expected from the public sector will depend on\nthe type of the workforce available which will rely on the training provided.\nTraining is a necessity for the public service and there is no single department having ever\nmissed providing induction training at the time when the new recruit learns about the\nbasic elements and activities that will be needed at work. Evidently, one-off training is\nnever enough and employees are bound to follow courses appropriate to their needs as and\nwhen they progress through their career path. This is where development comes in and\nhelps the experienced worker further his competences to keep adapting himself to changing\ncircumstances at work. Also, there is the need for promotion through career development.\nIn recent years, learning has also become a critical success factor at work. To learn means to\nacquire knowledge and skills not only for the present but equally for the future. Although\ntraining and learning are terms used interchangeably, learning has been gaining greater\nrecognition because it deals with the lifelong experience of bettering one\u2019s abilities while being\nat work. The work of Peter Senge on the \u2018learning organisation\u2019 along with other respected\nscholars helps people and managers learn about developing such an organisation that keeps\nitself abreast of changes in the form of new ideas, technology, workplace arrangement, and\nwork conditions are likely to impact today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s work environment.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n210 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nThis chapter provides an outlook of both training and learning and their relevance to\nthis new decade of the millennium. Obviously, it stresses the importance of learning and\ndeveloping such a culture with the perspective that public organisations can only become\nhighly performing through sustained learning.\nInvesting in Public Sector Training\nThe shrinkage in the half-life of knowledge, now more often measured in months rather\nthan years, coupled with the changing demographics of today\u2019s public sector workforce calls\nfor knowledgeable and trained workers. Therefore, government agencies at every level are\nunder relentless pressure to ensure they have a knowledgeable and efficient workforce. If\ngovernments are to keep pace with the changes they face in our globalised world of rapid\ngrowth and changing technology, training and educating their workforce is a critical mission.1\nThe need to have a public workforce that is current has accelerated dramatically in contrast\nto the situation less than a quarter century ago. Then, employees would typically complete\ntheir formal education, and the knowledge they brought to their first job would sustain\nthem throughout their career. Today\u2019s environment is markedly different. Providing just-in-\ntime education and training programmes has now surfaced as a strategy for sustaining and\nimproving the effectiveness, efficiency, and competitiveness of today\u2019s public sector workers.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n221111 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nThis strategy cannot be executed without cost. Keeping a growing and changing public sector\nworkforce current and technically astute, as well as providing opportunities for employees\nto acquire the requisite knowledge and skills to remain competitive, requires investments\nthat will come from increasingly scarce resources. Therefore, the challenge for government\nis to determine how best to invest its limited resources for the creation and delivery of a\ncomprehensive workforce education program that will meet these needs.\nPublic service training\u2019s functions and objectives\nThe objectives governments pursue with in-service training for public service personnel\nare defined in the public service legislation, either in the public service act or in specific\nregulations on training; in some cases, the objectives are fixed in the constitution. These\nare developed as follows: the need to have demand-driven and practically-oriented courses,\nthe need to disseminate knowledge, skills development, certifying learning among others.2\n- Development of skills, knowledge, and awareness in Management, Leadership,\nAdministration, and Office Support. This will be achieved through delivery of\nquality, demand-driven, and practically oriented training programmes.\n- Offering advisory services in Public Service Management.\n- Providing training capacity (volume, range, quality) that meets public service needs.\n- Disseminating knowledge on good Public Service Management \u2013 Best Practice \u2013\nthis will be achieved through applied research and publication of research findings.\n- Development of skills in new management technologies.\nAwarding Diplomas and Certificates to qualified graduates of professional\nprogrammes, and,\n- Transforming training institutions) into an effective efficient and professional public\nservice training agency. This will be achieved, in part, by entering into strategic\nalliances with public and private training and development institutions and people.\nTraining to serve better\nGovernments worldwide are increasingly facing more challenges in dealing with rising public\nexpectations. To make the needs of the future, the fundaments of public governance should\nbe in place to serve as an anchor in a turbulent world economy.\nThe key to every successful public agency is in the talent and training of the employees\nwho serve the public. No matter their function or organisational structure, state and local\nagencies are continuously striving to recruit, train, and retain top talent. With budget cuts\naffecting professional development line items first, alternative methods to provide leadership\ntraining onsite and online are essential.3\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n212 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nGovernment by design calls on public-sector leaders to favour the rational and the analytical\nover the purely ideological, and to be willing to abandon tools and techniques that no\nlonger work. Four principles are at its core: the use of better evidence for decision making,\ngreater engagement and empowerment of citizens, thoughtful investments in expertise and\nskill building, and closer collaboration with the private and social sectors. Each of these\nprinciples is central to creating more effective yet affordable government.\nLinking training to career development\nLearning and development are critical processes for enhancing productivity and organisational\nperformance. The management of these learning and development processes is central to\ntheir effectiveness. Research shows high-performing organisations share certain features in\nrelation to learning and development as follows:4\n- They align and integrate their learning and development initiatives with corporate\nand business planning by reviewing existing activities and initiating new learning\nprogrammes to support corporate plans.\n- The corporate culture supports these initiatives and addresses cultural barriers\nto learning.\n- Their managers invest in, and are accountable for, learning and development.\n- They focus on the business application of training rather than the type of training,\nand they consider appropriate learning options \u2013 de-emphasising classroom training\nand allowing staff time to process what they have learned on the job consistent\nwith adult learning principles.\n- They evaluate learning and development formally, systematically and rigorously.\nPrinciples behind public sector training\nThe formulation, implementation and evaluation of programmes of public service training\nand education must be carried out under the following broad principles:5\nAccess and entitlement\nAll public servants will be entitled to ongoing and meaningful opportunities for training\nand education, on recruitment and throughout their working lives (This broad principle will\nalso be extended to cover potential recruits to the public service through the development\nand improvement of the current bursary schemes).\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n213 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nNeeds analysis\nProgrammes of training and education will be based on a detailed assessment of the needs\nof individual organisations and employees, and will be designed in particular to secure an\noptimal fit between these two sets of needs.\nA competency-based approach to learning outcomes\nThe new approach to public service training and education will focus on outcomes rather\nthan inputs, with particular reference to the competences required at different levels to build\nindividual and organisational capacity.\nIntegration between policy-formulation, strategic planning and transformation\nFar from being marginalised, as in the past, it will be expected of government departments\nand provincial administrations to systematically link training and education to the broader\nprocesses of policy formulation, strategic planning and transformation, at national, departmental\nand provincial levels, particularly in relation to service delivery, institution building and\nmanagement, human resources development, and representativeness and affirmative action.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n221144 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nAdequate resourcing\nThis will be vital for the success of the training and education system, and will be ensured in\nparticular by integrating plans and priorities for training and education as a central element\nin the budget planning process, at national, departmental and provincial levels.\nFlexibility and decentralisation\nThese must ensure programmes of training and education are designed flexibly to meet the\nindividual and changing needs of particular departments and provinces, responsibility will\nbe decentralised as much as possible, within agreed national norms and standards.\nCareer pathing\nProgrammes of training and education will be targeted in particular at facilitating career\npaths for all staff that promote progression \u2013 vertical and lateral \u2013 and productivity, and for\nthis reason such programmes will need to be positively related to policies on recruitment,\npromotion, grading, remuneration and performance appraisal.\nLifelong learning\nPublic service training and education will be linked to the National Qualifications Framework\n(NQF) in ways which promote lifelong learning and the development of portable skills and\ncompetences. Public service training and education will also be linked to the Department of\nLabour\u2019s Skills Development Strategy, particularly through the development of appropriate\ntraineeships for the service.\nLearning organisations\nTraining, education and development will be promoted in ways which enable public service\ninstitutions to become learning organisations, capable of continuous development and\nadaptation through the creative integration of learning with work at all levels.\nQuality and cost-effectiveness\nThese will be promoted through the effective utilisation of available resources; the avoidance\nof duplication; the establishment of effective structures and mechanisms for the coordination\nof training and education at national and provincial levels; the introduction of improved\nforms of standard setting and accreditation; and the targeting of training and education at\nactivities that add value by developing skills, knowledge and attitudes that can be readily\ntransferred to the job.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n215 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nEquity and empowerment\nTraining and education will be linked to broader plans and programmes for promoting\nemployment and occupational equity, and will be targeted in particular at the empowerment\nof historically disadvantaged groups.\nConsultation and participation\nTo ensure broad commitment and support at all levels within the public service, plans and\nprogrammes for training and education will be formulated, implemented and evaluated\nwith the full participation and involvement of the public service unions and all other\nrelevant stakeholders.\nInformation and communication\nInformation about training and education opportunities will be collected and collated, and\nshared at all levels throughout the public service.\nEffective design and delivery\nTo enhance the relevance, quality and cost-effectiveness of training and education, programmes\nwill be designed and delivered.\nMonitoring and evaluation\nTo ensure plans and programmes of training and education happen throughout the public\nservice under the above principles, effective mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and\nevaluation will be put into place.\nElevating the status of training and trainers\nTo ensure training, education, and human resources development play an increasingly\nstrategic and integral part in building a new public service the position, role, and status of\ntrainers as human resource specialists will need to be significantly redefined and enhanced.\nCase Study: Public sector training\u2019s importance6\nThe public service has to adapt to an enormous number of changes in a very short time. The\nstaff is faced with a constantly changing regulatory framework which needs implementation\nand enforcement, as well as new demands from the growing private sector and the citizenry at\nlarge. These challenges can only be met if the staff is highly qualified and constantly updating\ntheir qualifications. A sound system of in-service training is therefore crucial to keep the\npersonnel within the public service on equal footing with the rapidly changing environment.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n216 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nMost countries have established public service training systems over the past three decades.\nThese systems vary depending on factors, such as whether the state is central or federal, the\ntype of the civil service system, and the recruitment philosophy. Other key factors include\nthe training system\u2019s objectives, legal framework, funding, training institutions, statute of\ntrainers, and content of training. Government policy decisions on these matters determine\nthe overall set-up of the training system.\nOne common objective of public service training is to support the implementation of\nadministrative reform and modernisation; another is to improve professional skills and\nqualifications of staff to increase efficiency of the public service. In some countries, the right\nand/or obligation of civil servants to undergo in-service training is stated in the constitution.\nIn most countries, training is regulated either in the civil service act or in by-laws.\nTraining may be financed in a decentralised or centralised way. In the former case, funds are\nallocated to the budget of the employing institution which manages the funds for training\nof its staff and \u2018pays\u2019 the training institution executing the training. In the case of centralised\nfunding, funds are allocated to the civil service commission or to training institutions. Many\ngovernments apply a mixed funding system.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n221177 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nIn the past, public sector training institutions did not have to compete with private\nsector training institutions as the latter did not offer any training geared to public sector\npersonnel. However, since in many countries the public service is introducing \u2018private sector\u2019\nmanagement techniques, private sector training institutions have discovered a new market,\nsuch as training public servants. Nowadays public sector training institutions are facing\nmarket competition, at least in some training areas, and are competing on equal footing\nwith private sector providers.\nThe development of training policies is in principle assigned to the government bodies\nwhich oversee service and personnel policies \u2013 the \u2018training demanders\u2019. These may be the\nministries in charge of the public service and administrative reform (as in France and Spain),\nor ministries of the interior (as in Germany and the Netherlands).\nIn most countries, several training institutions provide public service training, though only\none institute provides general training for common functions in the public service. Besides\nthe central institution, there often exist specialised training institutions, in particular within\nthe ministries of finance or welfare.\nThe status of trainers depends more on the training delivered than on national differences.\nOn in-service training, lecturers are hired as external collaborators; most in-service training\norganisations employ few permanent staff.\nPublic administrations have set up structures and procedures to assess public service training\nneeds. Usually, the needs assessment is the responsibility of each ministry or agency. A\nneeds assessment procedure usually draws on information from management and training\nrecipients. To be efficient, it has to be an ongoing process in which the evaluation of training\nmeasures in place plays an important role.\nSource: OECD (1997), \u201cPublic Service Training in OECD Countries, SIGMA Papers,\nNo. 16, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kml619ljzzn-en.\nQuestions\n1.

More graduates surveyed in national opinion polls have\nsaid they would rather work in the public sector than for a blue chip company. The main\nattraction of the public sector is the desire to make a difference to people\u2019s lives, but in the\nfew years or so there has been a significant emphasis on pay/working conditions and better\npensions in the public sector. There has been pay restructuring in the health service and\neducation as well as limits being placed on working hours. State employees have benefited\nfrom pay rises ahead of the private sector and the gap between average starting salaries in\nthe two sectors is getting much smaller.\nGraduate Civil Servants are responsible for formulating and implementing policy, investigating\nthe effect of changes in legislation, overseeing major public projects and managing resources.\nMany state departments and executive agencies do the Civil Service\u2019s work. Broadly speaking,\nthe departments are primarily responsible for devising policy and checking it is implemented.\nAgencies actually carry out the policies, such as assessing claims and paying out benefits,\nrunning the Crown Courts or administering overseas aid and development programmes.\nGiven the range of jobs available, the number of potential careers paths is immense, including\nmanagerial positions at all levels within departments. The government is implementing\nreforms to key services that involve national standards, devolution to the front line and\ngreater choice. Jobs in management have a particular importance in this process and\ninvolve many challenges. Some job roles can be prestigious with an enormous amount of\nresponsibility early on. The sector is widely respected and many graduates do deicide to\nmove in to private sector at a later stage in their career, often taking up senior and very\nwell-paid management and executive positions.\nLifelong learning in the public sector8\nLifelong learning is crucial to preparing workers to compete in the global economy. But it\nis important for other reasons as well. By improving people\u2019s ability to function as members\nof their communities, education and training increase social cohesion, reduce crime, and\nimprove income distribution.\nDeveloping countries and transition economies risk being further marginalised in a competitive\nglobal knowledge economy because their education and training systems are not equipping\nlearners with the skills they need.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n219 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nNew Skills and Competences\nPerforming in the global economy and functioning in a global society requires mastery of\ntechnical, interpersonal, and methodological skills. Technical skills include literacy, foreign\nlanguage, mathematics, science, problem-solving, and analytical skills. Interpersonal skills\ninclude teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Methodological skills include the\nability to learn on one\u2019s own, to pursue lifelong learning, and to cope with risk and change.\nNew Pathways to Learning\nA lifelong learning system needs to reach larger segments of the population, reaching\npeople with diverse learning needs. It must be competency driven rather than age related.\nWithin traditional institutional settings, new curricula and new teaching methods need to\nbe adopted. At the same time, efforts need to be made to reach learners who cannot enrol\nin programmes at traditional institutions.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n222200 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nGovernance System\nThe governance of lifelong learning needs to achieve a better integration of learning\nprogrammes and articulation of the different structures. Learners should be able to come\nin and go out of the system at different points in time. The learning system needs to bring\nin a multitude of players, including the individual learner, the family, the employer, the\nprovider, and the State. Governance in the lifelong learning framework is therefore more\nthan just the ministries of education and training.\nFinancing Options\nProviding more and better education and training opportunities over a lifetime will require\nincreased expenditures, although resources will also need to be used more efficiently and\nin different ways. These expenditures cannot be met solely from public sources; a creative\npartnership is required involving both the private and public sectors.\nInsight: China\u2019s public sector in need of business education9\nIn a significant reform move, China is set to reshape its government-funded public institutions\nto improve the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of public services.\nThe Chinese government recently issued blueprints for the reform that will affect more\nthan 40m public sector staff currently working in approximately 1.26m government-run\npublic institutions across the country such as schools, hospitals, publishing houses and the\nagriculture and forestry sectors.\nAny reorganisation across China\u2019s public sector will not automatically yield a more market-\noriented, customer-friendly and cost-effective service. The root cause of the problems can be\nfound in the lack of education and training in contemporary business and management methods.\nWhat is needed is a long-term business and management education training programme,\ntailored to the specific needs of each public sector industry. For example, health services\nare people-oriented and require education and training in people management and\ncommunication skills. Agriculture and forestry, on the other hand, require education and\ntraining in contemporary technology and efficient supply chain management methods.\nThe scheduling of any such training programmes is also key to any improvement with an\ninitial short, \u2018burst\u2019 followed by a long-term \u2018drip\u2019 of training provision lasting several years.\nIt is also important to do things differently with a suitable mix of Chinese and western\ntraining experts involved at all times. Too few Chinese trainers will create confusion and\ntension, however too few western experts may lead to a feeling nothing is particularly new\nand no real change is required.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n221 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nFurther, to deliver training that is really tailored to the needs of Chinese consumers, a\nblend of Chinese and western methods is needed. Chinese consumers have become more\ndemanding and will only be satisfied with higher quality standards and more efficient service\ndelivery, aspects western methods are used to supplying.\nThere is a growing, global clamour for more \u2018responsible\u2019 management and China\u2019s public\ncompanies need to recognise and respond to this. Once again this is where the sector could\nbenefit from business education. China\u2019s public sector need look no further than the third\nglobal event hosted by the United Nation\u2019s Principles for Responsible Management Education\ninitiative due to take place in Rio De Janeiro in June.\nChina\u2019s public sector reform will only succeed if it is supported by an education and training\nculture that transcends the entire public sector. Education and training, often viewed by\nChinese managers as an unnecessary cost or at best a needed evil, needs to be seen as the\nkey to long-term progress and success.\nChina\u2019s economic miracle is at a crossroads right now and public sector reform is one of\nthe key challenges facing further progress. Long-lasting education and training-led reform\nis the way forward with no time to lose.\nEvaluating a training programme\nEvaluating a training programme can help an organisation meet different goals during the\nlife of training programme. Evaluation of training programme has two basic rules aims \u2013\nassessing training effectiveness, and using it as a training aid. The primary aim of evaluation\nis to improve training by discovering which training processes are successful in achieving\ntheir stated goals. Since evaluation affects learning, it can also be put to use as a training\naid \u2013 knowledge of results facilities good learning.10\nOther purposes of training evaluation include the following:\n- To determine whether the training and development aims are being met.\n- To determine the effectiveness of the different components of training and development\nprogramme (for instance contents, training aids, facilities and environment, programme\nschedule, presentation style, and the instructor).\n- To determine whether the training and development programme justifies the cost.\n- To decide who (number and type of potential participants) should take part in\nfuture programmes.\n- To assess which participants gained the most or the least from specific programmes.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n222 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\n- To gain practical insight to design, develop and deliver more effective\nfuture programmes.\n- To conform to policy guidelines and documentation of training and\ndevelopment efforts.\n- To check the extent of transfer of learning \u2013 the extent to which a trainee\napplies to his/her job.\n- To determine if the training programme maps to the needs of the trainees.\nPublic sector training evaluation is quite rarely administered in many environments since it\nis believed to be good on its own right. There are several HRM models that can apply to the\npublic service namely the CIRO model or the Kirkpatrick model. These may be done at the\nsupervisory level by managers in the different ministerial departments. Often, the contrary\nseems to take place where public sector employees are evaluated for their performance based\non training they have gained. Such training effectiveness can only be evidenced after public\nsector employees have been subject to working for a while in their departments. Training\nshould offer the key benefits like how public employees approach their work, how they\nlook to be more motivated and sincere with their activity, how quickly and efficiently they\ncan deliver the service to customers and how productive they have become on their own\nby making savings and being efficient users of their own resources.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n222233 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nEvidently, training does not stop according to the systematic training cycle. It must continue\nand be re-adapted to new employees\u2019 needs. This is achieved through ongoing feedback\nemployees might provide to managers or trainers. In a situation where higher levels of\ncompetence are required, training has become more of a necessity. The creation of Civil\nService Colleges or training institutions either inside or outside the organisation claim a\nsingle aim in the public service should strive for excellence through the appropriate training\nstrategy management favours on behalf of the workers and must be seen to be effective\nfollowing the time, effort, and money invested in training. Although there might be mixed\nperceptions from employees being subject either too rarely or too often to training, keeping\nthe public sector employee at large with innovations in learning, work pattern, management,\nstyle and communication certainly has a positive contribution to the overall effectiveness of\nthe organisation. Therefore, training impacts each level of an organisation and the public\nsector cannot claim not to benefit from training strategies that are constantly being developed\nby the government. It has become much easier to get trained in the public service through\nthe development of new learning technologies.\nPoints\nTraining and learning are key issues that need to be addressed in the public service since\nit is argued high levels of performance will depend on the type of the workforce available\nand the training provided.\nIf governments are to keep pace with the changes they face in our globalised world of rapid\ngrowth and changing technology, training and educating their workforce is a critical mission.\nLearning and development are critical processes for enhancing productivity and organisational\nperformance.\nProgrammes of training and education must be targeted at facilitating career paths for all\nstaff that promote progression and productivity.\nTraining programmes will need to be positively related to policies on recruitment, promotion,\ngrading, remuneration and performance appraisal.\nSome common goals of public service training are to support the implementation of\nadministrative reform and modernisation, and to improve professional skills and qualifications\nof staff to increase efficiency of the public service.\nLifelong learning is crucial to preparing workers to compete in the global economy.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n224 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PubliC seCtor training, and learning\nBy improving people\u2019s ability to function as members of their communities, education and\ntraining increase social cohesion, reduce crime, and improve income distribution.\nPerforming in the global economy and functioning in a global society requires mastery of\ntechnical, interpersonal, and methodological skills.\nThe governance of lifelong learning needs to achieve a better integration of learning\nprogrammes and articulation of the different structures.\nThe learning system needs to bring in a multitude of players, including the individual\nlearner, the family, the employer, the provider, and the State.\nAn evaluation of a training programme can help an organisation meet different goals during\nthe life of training programme.\nIt also determines whether the training and development aims are being met, whether the\ntraining and development programme justifies the cost, checks the extent of transfer of\nlearning and determine if the training programme maps to the needs of the trainees.\nQuestions\n1.

The future has always\nbeen something of high importance to public sector leaders since it is unpredictable but\nfull of challenges and uncertainties. To some extent, the management of public sector\nchange anticipates the likely new environment that will shape up business in a near future.\nOtherwise, forward strategic planning is also essential in anticipating changes that are likely\nto impact on the future.\nThe future of the public service is important as history evidences the changes taking place\nin office and in different workplaces over the years. From the office having a few typists and\nlots of paperwork, to a modernised office using electronic typewriters and word processors,\nsuch a change has transformed the pace of work in the public service. But then came the\nmicroprocessors, desktop computer systems, the Internet, and social networks that were not\nsought of earlier but eventually affects the lives of people using the public service in most\ncountries of the world.\nThese mutations call for constantly thinking of the public service in the future. To make\nthe reading easy and quite quickly assimilative, this chapter focuses on the contribution of\nmajor thinkers of the public sector and integrates their views with the expected changes\nin the years to come. Quite often, the same term \u2018modernisation\u2019 comes to the forefront\nof debates meaning the public service has to coexist with changes taking place in society.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n227 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nIt can be ongoing technological changes could be key factors prompting the public service\nto improve and better address the needs of the citizens. Apart from infrastructural changes,\nnew findings on the public sector\u2019s future speak of citizen-centrism, digitalisation of services,\ncrowdsourcing and the effort of developing collaborative innovation so tomorrow\u2019s public\nsector will be more engaged with the community and better attempt to address the pressing\nissues although it is not always easy to come close to the ideals defined by today\u2019s strategists\nin public affairs.\nReorganising public sector\nGlobal uncertainty and austerity are propelling governments into a future that becomes\nincreasingly difficult to anticipate. How therefore should the leading public body of the\nfuture organise itself for affordability, resilience and continued relevance? The world has\nmoved quickly over the course of the Great Recession but governments have often struggled\nto keep pace. The public sector organisations need to deal with uncertainty, deliver affordable\nservices while also coping with disruptive changes.\nExpectations of public services have risen exponentially with rapid developments in new\ntechnology, but the funds for investing in public services have dried up in many countries.\nThe challenge for governments and their public sectors worldwide is now to adjust to the\nnew reality of \u2018doing more for less\u2019 (or \u2018doing less for less\u2019) and focus on the outcomes\nsociety needs and wants.\nPublic bodies must decide if they want to consume the legacy left behind by predecessors,\nor create a new legacy for the next generation, while navigating some seismic shifts. Public\nsector organisations need to re-evaluate their purpose and role and decide if current visions\nand missions, and ways of operating to achieve them, are relevant enough to ride the waves\nof these shifts, or be overwhelmed by them. Government and public sector organisations\nwill also need to respond to these shifts proactively and pre-emptively, to avoid falling one\nor more steps behind.1\nSeismic shifts in public service\nTo understand how the future may well change in the years to come, the table below\ndeveloped by Price Waterhouse Coopers (2013) gives us an overview of the types of changes\nlikely to affect the public sector.2\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n228 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nSeismic shifts: Bridging from now to the future\n\u2022 Citizen under control \u2022 Citizen in control\n\u2022 Governing for citizens \u2022 Governing with citizens\n\u2022 Organisation silos \u2022 Organisation networks\n\u2022 Public sector organisations as big, \u2022 Public sector organisations as small,\nall-in-one giants flexible, purpose-driven entities\n\u2022 Government as service provider \u2022 Government as service facilitator/\nbroker/commissioner\n\u2022 Government owning inputs and \u2022 Governments and citizens owning\nprocesses outcomes\n\u2022 Measuring outputs \u2022 Measuring outcomes\n\u2022 Forced cooperation based on \u2022 Mutual collaboration based on trust\nenforcement\n\u2022 Trust in the \u2018strong leader\u2019 \u2022 Trust in each other, the \u2018servant leader\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n222299 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nFrom citizen under control to citizen in control\nThe general impression gained from the public service is the citizen as a user of services\nis subject to control by the State. The government acts as a regulator of activities for the\nbenefit of the public in the form of services or welfare. The new paradigm states this must\nnow shift to the citizen who gains more control or manoeuvre over services provided by\nthe public service. The relationship which was more a \u2018father figure\u2019 style or paternalistic\napproach should change by giving more power to the common citizen.\nFrom governing for citizens to governing with Citizens\nInitially, government was in office to work for the citizens. It was the expectation from users\nof public service that was important for government to stay. Still, the State took all decisions\nwith little left for citizens. The new paradigm calls for a collaborative approach between\ngovernment and citizens. There needs to be greater convergence of ideas on State decisions\nor policies. These should include the public as participant in most of the important activities.\nFrom organisation silos to organisation networks\nTraditionally, the public sector is viewed as organisational silos where the tall structure\ncreates bureaucracy and decisions are taken from the top in the form of rubber stamps.\nThis structure should not be welcomed in the future since silos do not allow for the proper\nchannelling of ideas and policies. Rather the creation of networks aims at better developing\nintegrated communication systems and a higher level of interaction and involvement among\nthe different stakeholders.\nFrom public sector organisations as giants to small, flexible, purpose-driven entities\nSince the public sector looks like a large parapublic organisation, depending on the size of\nthe nation concerned and the number of officials it employs, the large public sector remains\npoorly responsive to the public needs. In contrast, smaller, flexible, and purposely-driven\nentities are better at their specialised role and also more apt to respond to the public\u2019s needs.\nThere should, however, be a certain degree of accountability and responsiveness from the\nsmall organisations developed for flexibility, else, small entities could look like an \u2018empire\nbuilding effort\u2019.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n230 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nFrom government as service provider to government as a service facilitator\nGovernment is perceived as a service provider regarding all what the public generally needs in\na country. The service provider concept looks paternalistic here in that without the provider,\nnothing special can be expected. Government should better act as a facilitator whereby it\noffers the services to engage citizens better use them and take them to their advantage rather\nthan expecting to be eternally assisted.\nFrom government owning inputs and processes to governments and citizens\nowning outcomes\nInputs and processes are State-owned in so far what is government-owned cannot become\nthe property of the public. It looks like all the energy involved in the provision of public\nservices should be the exclusivity of the government. The outcomes will have to mutually-\nowned as a future-oriented model where both counterparts collectively own the outcomes\nlike greater availability of e-services, greater benefit from using e-government along with\nthe documentation needed.\nFrom measuring outputs to measuring outcomes\nThe effectiveness of government comes from the State measures year in year out what it has\nbeen able to produce. Creating hospitals, schools, and security services are broadly measurable\noutputs and account for what the State achieved in the mid or long-term. Measuring\noutcomes goes the other way in that the benefits achieved from providing excellent service\nand greater public trust are considered as tangible or intangible outcomes. For instance, a\nWi-Fi zone offered in a remote rural area could be a benefit or outcome that impacts on\ncitizens regarding their connectivity to the world.\nFrom trust in the strong leader to trust in each other\nUsually, governance firstly calls for trust in the leader or the powerful minister to get things\ndone for the public. This might give too much weight to a policy maker rather than to the\nservice user. Sharing the trust between the decision makers and the public is something of\nexceptional value particularly when empowerment is on the move and encourages a greater\ninvolvement of both parties through collective sharing of responsibility and success.\nCitizen-centricity remains a priority\nThis is not about giving priority to those who pay for the services \u2013 the \u2018customer centric\u2019\napproach \u2013 but going beyond to focus on the effect of public services on the wider society,\nwith the citizen at the very centre. The citizen then becomes not just a customer or client,\nbut also a partner, collaborator, and co-producer of valued outcomes.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n231 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nThis implies a new contract with the empowered citizen taking personal responsibility\nfor outcomes. For this to succeed, those who deliver public services need to increase the\ninvolvement of the end-user in the design and development of services, rather than just\nselling a service. This entails iterative dialogue and the use of novel approaches to engage\ncitizens. A by-product of a citizen centric approach is the building of trust and relevance\nat a time when mistrust and illegitimacy are threatening the role of public leaders.\nStrategies to build a citizen-centric government\nFoster \u2022 Use technology and support systems to provide more user-\norganisational friendly services.\nchange \u2022 Centralise customer data and standardise procedures and\nforms to reduce bureaucracy.\n\u2022 Improve flexibility for quick and efficient decision-making.\n\u2022 Conduct surveys regularly to get a quick understanding of\ncustomers\u2019 immediate needs.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n223322 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nDevelop leadership \u2022 Respond quickly to changes citizens demand.\n\u2022 Communicate strategies through all levels of the\norganisation to ensure everyone is working towards the\nsame goals.\n\u2022 Define responsibilities and accountability clearly.\n\u2022 Involve more people in cooperative decision-making to\ninstil trust in decisions.\nEstablish cultures \u2022 Define strategic organisation values that align with\nand values employees\u2019 expectations.\n\u2022 Use motivational techniques to create an environment that\npromotes change.\n\u2022 Employ team-building approaches to create a knowledge-\nbased organisation with shared values.\nBuild customer \u2022 Respond quickly to changing customer needs.\nrelationships \u2022 Employ customer-relationship management (CRM) and\nconduct surveys to improve customer service.\n\u2022 Develop customer-oriented products and services.\nImprove operations \u2022 Deploy advanced technologies \u2013 e-administration, websites,\nmobile phones \u2013 to broaden communication channels.\n\u2022 Standardise IT systems to reduce costs and complexity.\n\u2022 Adopt more cost-effective channels like Internet to deliver\nservices.\nManage \u2022 Use benchmarks and key performance indicators (KPIs) to\nperformance measure efficiency and performance of processes.\n\u2022 Establish remuneration systems to reward top performers.\n\u2022 Develop training programmes to foster knowledge-based\norganisations.\nSupport \u2022 Promote \u2018green government\u2019 by bring together economic,\nsustainability social and environmental issues.\n\u2022 Encourage e-services and multi-channel communications to\nencourage sustainability.\n\u2022 Bring together people, interest groups and non-\ngovernmental organisations to support sustainability.\nDeveloping the cluster concept in public service\nNational economic frameworks and their spatial implications play a role in the development\nand implementation of policies to promote industrial clusters. Because clusters may range\nfrom the local to the national, governments at all levels should be involved.3\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n233 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nCentral coordination is needed, however, due to inherent externalities of cluster activities,\nespecially on issues such as innovation, knowledge, and supply-chain development. Central\nlevel coordinating strategies include inter-ministerial or inter-agency committees that\nconceptualise, design, and respond jointly to cluster-based policy recommendations. These\nare needed for public-private dialogues to be meaningful.\nGovernments should have a high-profile role in the initial stages, such as guiding the cluster\nmapping, and in the final stages, such as leading public-private dialogues on policy and\ninstitutional bottlenecks that inhibit industry development and the business environment.\nThe government may assume a lower profile during intermediate stages, such as the analysis\nof firm-level competitiveness and market and product segmentation. The state, however,\nshould remain involved, because these analyses will help it understand industry bottlenecks,\nwhich can later inform policy and programme formulations.\nUsing analytics to better define future public service\nThe public sector needs to become more efficient in the way they operate, cut costs, optimise\ntheir workforce and manage their risk, while continuing to deliver the core public services\ntheir citizens require. Analytics can form a major part of the solution to these problems by\ngenerating the required insights and enabling fact based decision making \u2013 the analytics based\napproaches and solutions we develop can be applied across different countries and public\nsector organisation. The insight and innovation derived from these solutions can add value\nirrespective of scale \u2013 an analytics model or tool used in a small public sector organisation\ncan often be applied at scale for a large government or department.4\nWorkforce Workforce planning Absenteeism & Reduced Organisational\nAnalytics & Productivity.

A key to success in the\nknowledge economy is a trained labour force. It is not surprising so many countries have\nfocused on improving their educational systems. All of this is commendable.\nFirst, in the long run, success in the knowledge economy requires creativity, higher order\ncognitive skills in addition to basic skills. Those countries that find ways of fostering\nthis kind of creativity will, in the long run, have more success in the competition of the\nknowledge economy.\nSecond, also key to success in the knowledge economy is training in science and technology.\nThere are good grounds for government subsidies to science education: Because those engaged\nin research so seldom capture the full benefits of their work, there are, as we noted earlier,\nreal externalities. These externalities may be most marked for graduate education.\nThird, one of the reasons the education sector may not be as strong as we would like is it\nis one of the sectors in which competition is most limited. Yet there are good reasons why\nmarket mechanisms fail to work well and to serve fully national goals.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n223366 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nCase Study: Public sector jobs\u2019 future6\nWhile government positions remain attractive to those seeking security and a middle-class\nlifestyle, the stereotype of the public sector as a fall back for the less-than-ambitious is\nstarting to disintegrate. Budget deficits at the federal and municipal levels have prevented\nthe public sector workforce from expanding in recent years, while most areas of public\nenterprise are unlikely to see much growth in the future. Even health care and social services,\nwork-oriented around the ageing population, is projected by federal forecasters to grow at\nhalf the pace it did in the past decade, or about 1.7 per cent annually, and governments\nface increasing pressure to close the wage and benefit gap between civil servants and their\nprivate sector counterparts. Some have begun clawing back perks granted in earlier rounds\nof collective bargaining.\nAll told, say experts, public service jobs may be harder to come by and less rewarding than\nthey have in the past. \u2018Governments are more or less in a hiring-freeze mode,\u2019 says David\nMadani, Canada economist with Capital Economics, an international research firm. \u2018As\npeople retire, they\u2019re simply not filling positions.\u2019 That sense of caution, he adds, could last\nfor years. Human Resources Development Canada\u2019s most recent forecasts predict employment\ngrowth in education and public administration will slow \u2018drastically\u2019 between now and 2020,\nto less than 0.6 per cent. The outlook for wage growth in the public sector is similarly\nunderwhelming: One study, by the Hay Group management consultants, predicted it would\nlag the private sector in 2013 by more than half a percentage point, struggling to keep up\nwith inflation.\nTo a degree, the next generation of job seekers is paying for the past successes of public\nsector workers in collective bargaining. Bureaucrats, teachers, utility workers, and others\nwere able to amass enviable packages of pay, benefits, and pensions over the decades, in part\nbecause they held monopoly over the services they provided. If they walked out, the public\nwould feel the pain keenly. So would their bosses over in the legislative branch. Many of\nthose gains were realised when Baby Boomers were in their career primes, and now, with\nhundreds of thousands in retirement, governments and workers alike are feeling the burden.\nIn Ontario, for instance, teachers are paying higher pension premiums, while their pay has\nbeen frozen and their coveted sick-day banks curtailed. In B.C., school support staff have\nnot had a raise in four years.\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n237 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nMeantime, ideas have changed inside and outside government about what services belong\nin the public realm. In most cities, garbage collection is performed by private firms, while\nprovinces busily outsource ongoing business, such as employment counselling. \u2018They\u2019re\ntrying to contract out as much as possible,\u2019 says Morley Gunderson, an expert in labour\neconomics with the University of Toronto. \u2018And they\u2019re substituting capital for labour in\nsubtle forms. You have self-service kiosks and online service for licence renewal, and things\nlike that.\u2019 Those trends are nowhere near as pervasive as in the private sector, Gunderson\nnotes, but he adds: \u2018If you can monitor the output \u2013 of a service \u2013 easily, then, usually,\ncontracting it out saves quite a bit of money.\u2019\nThat\u2019s not to say the public sector will shrink dramatically. Skilled employees such as\nteachers, nurses, and accountants continue to be in demand. And any government that\ntried to outsource basic administrative services outside its jurisdiction would face a political\nbacklash. Still, anyone who gets a public service job is well-advised to moderate expectations.\nAfter years of kicking the cost can down the road, governments are only starting to pay\nthe bills, and overburdened taxpayers are in no mood to be trifled with. Workers who fail\nto understand that are probably in for a rude awakening.\nSource: Gillis, C.

How does the Canadian situation reflect a similar condition in the public service\nworldwide?\nSelected visions of the public sector in the future\nIn this section, a selection of scholars\u2019 views of the future of the public sector in Europe\nis presented with different authors sharing their perspectives of an upcoming period for\nthe public service. There is emphasis on the digitalisation of the sector but also the need\nto be citizen centric, human resource focused and the will to bring about participatory\ndemocracy to evidence a paradigm shift in the public service over the years. Although the\nvision applies to the west, much can be said of potential similarities throughout the world\nin whatever state the question is raised.\nDigital democracy and the digital citizen\nAccording to Le Masson (2014), in the spirit of action and focus on execution, Europe can\nachieve digital-era governance through creating digital democracy and the digital citizen.\nThe actions are as follows:7\n- Co-design and co-create with citizens. Open legislative processes to constituents\n(for example: explaining policy changes, their societal and individual impact, pros\nand cons) and enable constituents to vote or engage digitally with their political\nrepresentatives.\n- Enhance the share of participatory budgeting at local and regional levels. Let people\nand communities decide their own priorities, where budgets should be focused.\nAlso provide feedback on key programmes and policies, and performance of their\nelected representatives.\n- Shift all interactions to self-service in a citizen centric approach. Encompass all\ntransactions, inquiries, requests for information and public correspondence too, with\na cross-agencies mind-set in the design and implementation of digital public services.\nCrowdsourcing in the public sector\nAlter (2014) states in most countries, innovation means emphasising ways of using new\ntechnologies to improve policy design, enhance coordination within government \u2013 and\nbetween the government and other actors \u2013 and reduce delivery costs. For instance,\ngovernment departments across the OECD are starting to use social media to \u2018crowdsource\u2019\ninformation and reactions.8\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n239 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nThe value of crowdsourcing for revealing preferences among different options, gauging\nlevels of support for particular actions, and canvassing for ideas or suggestions is now\nbeing recognised. Iceland\u2019s constitution is probably the most widely cited example of this\nnew concept in policy design, but there are many others appearing at national and, most\nstrikingly, at regional and local levels. More than 10% of the OECD population has\nnow been involved in an online government survey or voting exercises, a figure that was\nunthinkable before the Internet age.\nDemocracy as collaborative problem-solving\nBason (2014) states a vision of a new public governance model is not about seemingly\ntechnocratic innovation methods; it is about using collaborative problem solving as a vehicle\nto reimagine our democracy. We must downplay the negotiated model of democracy we\nhave inherited, which tends to limit the spectrum of influence to those with money or the\near of interest groups and which has eroded trust in the state as a force for good. Instead,\nwe must engage in a serious collective inquiry into what really constitutes our problems\nand opportunities.9\nDemocracy must be enriched by processes that broaden our horizons in terms of what\nkinds of solutions might be effective, and which open up the decision space before closing\nit down again. Such co-design between politicians, policymakers and citizens not only leads\nto more effective outcomes; it also redistributes the power dynamic by handing ordinary\ncitizens a share of the influence, and a sense of empowerment, ownership and collective\nresponsibility in governance drawn from their everyday experience.\nA pressing public policy\nAccording to Costa and Kaeding (2014), reforming public services may therefore contribute\nto economic and social development, fiscal consolidation, competitiveness, and green growth\nprospects, as well as democratic governance. Subsequently, pressing public policy issues\nsurrounding the transformation of the public sector call for an open and collaborative\ngovernment approach for which six elements are integral:10\nStrategy\nPerformance improvement and process reform through the measurement of outputs,\nsupported by careful evaluation of how technology will help meet overall goals, and with\ne-government being recognised as an increasingly essential tool for public service delivery;\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n240 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nLeadership\nSecuring top-level leadership\u2019s understanding and support;\nOrganisation design\nConsidering widespread substitution of contracts and the use of collaborative partnerships-\nwhether public-private partnerships, public-voluntary sector partnership, shared services or\noutsourcing;\nManagement\nCreating specialised \u2013 disaggregated \u2013 organisational forms focusing on customer-centricity\nand connected government;\nHuman resources\nFocusing on the internal capacity-building needed to manage transformation, managing\ntalent and training people of the public sector responding to changing \u2018customer\u2019 needs;\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n224411 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nCulture\nChanging management towards a new customer-centric culture for accessible, timely and\nvalue for money service.\nThe authors have also contributed to the Pollitt and Bouckaert model (2011) by adding\nparticipatory democracy as the new paradigm of the contemporary public sector in the years\nto come.

To foster\nthis type of collaborative initiative on a large scale, one needs a supportive ecosystem. This\nis an area where government can play a critical role in identifying new actors capable of\nintervening locally, accelerating and funding promising initiatives, and in regulating \u2013 not\nrunning \u2013 the surrounding ecosystem. The current action plan is considerable, spanning\nfrom the need to recognise the power of social innovation (just as technological innovation),\nto establishing hybrid legal forms of entities, facilitating innovative financing models and\nsupportive tax legislation, and redefining and adapting the notion of the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d\nto current challenges.12\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n242 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT a future PersPeCtive of the PubliC seCtor\nPoints\nPublic service\u2019s future matters as history evidences the changes taking place in office and in\ndifferent workplaces over the years.\nGlobal uncertainty and austerity are propelling governments into a future that becomes\nincreasingly difficult to anticipate.\nThe new paradigm calls for a collaborative approach between government and citizens.

What are the key changes you perceive? Do they\ninfluence a more pro-active than placid public sector? Discuss.\n41. Explain the term \u2018citizen centricity\u2019. Two strategies that create citizen centricity are\norganisational change and customer relationship. Identify key issues to be addressed\nin both cases.
