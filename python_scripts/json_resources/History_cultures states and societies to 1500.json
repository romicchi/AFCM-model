It did, and Sellards collapsed unconscious at the excavation.\n\u2026 But the moment Sellards regained consciousness he insisted on continuing to excavate.1\nThe above case of Florida State Geologist Elias Sellards demonstrates that the study of\n\u201chuman antiquity\u201d or man\u2019s earliest origins is one surrounded by passion, controversy, and\na deep well of curiosity. Our curiosity about our earliest origins has not only given birth to\nfictional characters like Indiana Jones and Captain Kirk, but also is largely responsible for the\ngrowth of archaeology in the early twentieth century. Western scholars and explorers were\n1 David J. Meltzer, The Great Paleolithic War: How Science Forged an Understanding of America\u2019s Ice Age Past (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 2015), 1.\nPage | 1 not content with simply reaching remote places; they were curious about their earliest human\ninhabitants. While the motives of early excavators may have been quite simple (Well-known\npaleoanthropologist Richard Leakey got his start collecting stones as a child), archaeologists\nand paleoanthropologists eventually created an entirely new field of historical investigation:\nprehistory. Multiple pioneers have hacked through underbrush or spent months excavating\nPaleolithic sites. Not until recently, however, have scientific advances, local knowledge, and\nanthropological theory merged with the curiosity of western explorers to craft a more accurate\nversion of human origins and evolution.\nWritten texts are the primary sources most historians are trained to work with and are those\nthey are most comfortable using. However, if we are to understand humanity\u2019s origins, we have\nto recognize that written language is a relatively recent invention (around 5,000 years old);\ntherefore, much of what we know about human beginnings must be borrowed from the findings\nof colleagues in other disciplines like geology, botany, and archaeology. In all of the regions\nmentioned below, archaeologists have excavated and analyzed physical evidence relating to our\npre-historic ancestors. Up until recent times, though, it was difficult to understand migration\npatterns and chronology without a method to determine the age of anything from a human skull\nto a cutting tool. Archaeologists in the 1930s and 40s used imprecise terms like \u201cstone bowl\ncultures,\u201d a nomenclature that referred more to the details of the articles unearthed than their\nhistorical context.2 This began to change with the advent of radiocarbon dating or C14 dating in the\n1940s. Through this method, we were able to place thousands of organic archaeological materials\nin their proper historical context even without textual evidence. For artifacts over 40,000 years\nold, the amount of radioactive carbon we can recover doesn\u2019t permit accurate measurement.\nHowever, we do have a number of techniques to trace human origins even further back, including\naerial photography, side-scanning radar, and potassium-argon dating. All these techniques get\naround the lack of radioactive carbon in that they don\u2019t date the organic material, but instead the\nterrain in which they were found, allowing us to trace human origins back millions of years to the\nbeginnings of bipedalism.\nThe goal of this chapter, though, is not to trace human evolution from its beginnings, but\nto set the scene for the beginnings of civilization. In this chapter we will explore why hominids\nmoved, how they survived, and how they came to develop agriculture. We also hope to lay out why\nhumans in far flung parts of the world responded similarly to changing conditions around them\nand hence developed civilizations at roughly the same time.\nThis chapter begins at the origins of bipedalism some eight million years ago and brings us up\nto eight thousand years ago with the the Neolithic Era or \u201cnew stone age.\u201d Bipedal hominids would\ndevelop during the Pliocene era and our closest ancestors during the more recent Pleistocene.\nFinally, modern Homo sapiens would appear during the Holocene. During the Holocene\nhumans would perfect tool usage during the Paleolithic Era, and would usher in agriculture during\nthe Neolithic. Our chapter ends as humans prepare to enter the Bronze and Iron Ages.\n2 J.E.G Sutton, \u201cArcheology and Reconstructing History in the Kenya Highlands: The Intellectual Legacies of G.W.B.\nHuntingford and Louis S.B.

Beginning as far back as eight million years\nago, various species of hominids (the ancestors of modern humans or Homo sapiens) began to\nwalk upright. This bipedalism would allow these hominids to use their hands to develop, craft, and\nuse tools. Bipedalism would also eventually contribute to a move out of forests into the savanna\nand turn hominids into big game hunters and gatherers. Paleoanthropologists once theorized\nthat hominids became bipedal to adapt to life in the grasslands. However, the fact that fossils of\nbipedal hominids were found alongside fossil remains of wood, seeds, and other forest dwellers\nhas cast some doubt on that theory. In fact, bipedal hominids may have lived in the forest for\nPage | 3 some time. While some bipedal hominids may have stayed in the forest, climate changes did drive\nothers to move into new areas within Africa and beyond it.\n1.5.1 Climate, Hominin in Evolution, and Migrations\nAs far as thirty million years ago hominids were reacting to changes in their environment.\n(\u201cHominids\u201d refers to all Great Apes including humans and their ancestors. \u201cHominins\u201d is often\nused when speaking more specifically\nabout modern humans and their more\nrecently extinct ancestors. We will use\n\u201chominids\u201d here because it covers all of\nthe groups we will reference including\nmodern humans). The earth cooled,\nproducing more fragmented environ-\nments. As already mentioned, some\nhominids may have stayed in the trees,\nbut those that left the forest began to\nthrive in grasslands. These savannas\nand prairies expanded during the\nMiocene, the geologic era lasting from\n24 \u2013 2 million years ago. This grassland\nexpansion prompted baboons and\nhominids to move out of the forest.\nDuring the Pliocene epoch (5 \u2013 1.6\nmillion years ago), another series of en-\nvironmental changes made these grass-\nlands even more prevalent, leading to a\ntransformation that geologists call the\n\u201cturnover-pulse hypothesis.\u201d Animals\nwith adaptations such as angled knee\nMap 1.1 | Early Hominid Fossil Sites\nAuthor: Corey Parson joints and arched feet survived on the\nSource: Original Work grasslands, while those with longer arms\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nor curved fingers who were better suited\nto the woodlands did not. For hominids,\nthis favorable grassland environment meant the \u201cdevelopment of several closely related species.\nLarge-toothed hominids known as robust australopithecines appeared in Southern and Eastern\nAfrica.\u201d 3 Towards the end of the Pliocene, around 2.4 million years ago, the first members of our\ngenus\u2014homo (Homo habilis)\u2014appeared, the first hominid to make stone tools.\nThe Pleistocene epoch (1.6 million \u2013 10,000 years ago) saw at least twenty-five periods\nof glaciation and warming. Glaciation resulted from dips in global temperature which had two\n3 Lauren Ristvet, In the Beginning: World History from Human Evolution to the First States (Boston: McGraw Hill, 2007), 4.\nPage | 4 CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY\nmajor effects on hominid development. First, with sea levels dropping due to glaciation, hominids\nmigrated to Australia and the Americas for the first time. Second, while many migrated out of\ncolder climates, those that remained developed physical adaptations. Homo neanderthalensis\n(Neaderthals), a hominid that disappeared 28,000 years ago, became stockier and more powerful\nto deal with the difficulties of this icy climate.\nWhile not as dramatic as previous developments, the current Holocene period has seen its\nshare of significant climatic events. The Younger Dryas event (c. 12,000 BCE) was a drop in global\ntemperatures accompanied by a corresponding change in vegetation distribution. Reduced rainfall\nfrom 2200 \u2013 1900 BCE made conditions very difficult for civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nFinally, the Medieval Warm Period represents \u201cone of the most recent periods of climate change.\u201d4\nLike neanderthalensis, Homo sapiens, Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and other\nhominids all reacted to changing climate conditions. Homo erectus and Homo habilis migrated,\nhunted, and used fire, while neanderthalensis had some use of language and tools and buried their\ndead. For millions of years, in fact, hominids had been using slivers of volcanic stone and cutters\nprobably to hack through animal skin. The cutters were often found close together, suggesting\nthat early hominids even had a division of labor between hunters who would have to pursue their\nprey and butchers who could wait nearby at the butchering site. There is even evidence of task\ndivision by gender among neanderthalensis. Multiple sites in Europe show different patterns of\nwear on male and female teeth, indicating a gendered task division in tasks where teeth were used\nto hold, break, or strip objects.5\nHowever, by 25,000 years ago all other hominins were extinct; only Homo sapiens sapiens,\nour species, survived. Paleoanthropologists attribute this survival to larger brains, durability, and\nability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Based on migration patterns and archaeo-\nlogical evidence, Homo sapiens sapiens appear to have been the only hominids to build sea-wor-\nthy boats, create art, have organized religion, and live in any climate.6\n1.5.2 Homo sapiens Migration\nWhile Homo sapiens were decidedly more advanced than other hominids, when they first\nmoved out of Africa some 45,000 years ago, they were only equipped with stone tools for hunting\nand cutting. Despite those initial limitations, 30,000 years later Homo sapiens would inhabit\nalmost every environment on earth and had a presence in every continent except Antarctica. Homo\nsapiens in fact moved further and faster than all other hominids. While it is hard to attribute a\nsingle factor to all Homo sapiens migration, we do see that multiple human societies required\nmigration to arrive at a more sophisticated level of development. Homo sapien migration acceler-\nated close to 40,000 years ago, where humans reached continental Eurasia.\nModern humans (50,000 \u2013 10,000 years ago) completed the migration to all the continents\nexcept Antartica, moving first into Australia, Eastern Siberia, the Pacific margins, Japan, and the\n4 Ibid., 3-5.\n5 Almudena Estalrrich and Antonio Rosas, \u201cDivision of Labor by Sex and Age in Neandertals: An Approach Through the\nStudy of Activity-Related Dental Wear,\u201d Journal of Human Evolution 80, (March 2015): 51-63.\n6 Ristvet., 24-26.\nPage | 5 Map 1.2 | The Spreading of Homo sapiens\nAuthor: NordNordWest\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nAmericas. Then from 10,000 years ago to 1,500 CE, humans arrived in the Arctic, the Indian Ocean,\nthe deep Pacific, and tropical rain forests. Migration occurred in a \u201cstaccato\u201d pattern with \u201ceasiest\u201d\nareas colonized quickly, while more \u201cdifficult\u201d areas remained uninhabited for thousands of years.\nA region\u2019s \u201ceasiness\u201d is calculated from estimates about available plant and animal biomass and\nnet productivity\u2014that is, how quickly it returns\u2014in each habitat. For example, tropical savannas\nand grasslands of East Africa were colonized first as the biomass there sustained the first bipedal\nhominids.\nHominids first left \u201csub-Saharan Africa \u2026 through the northern savannahs, up the Nile corridor\nor across the straits of Bab el Mandeb to the Arabian Peninsula.\u201d 7 Evidence exists of Homo erectus in\nMorocco, Chad, and Algeria, and it appears that they eventually left Africa via the Arabian Peninsula.\nAfter leaving Africa about 1.5 million years ago, choppers, handaxes, and spheroids found at sites\nlike Ubeidiya in Israel put Homo erectus in the Levant. Some scholars argue for the existence of a\nsecond migration out of Africa and into the Jordan Valley 500 to 600 thousand years ago.\nAsia\nSome evidence suggests the presence of Homo ergaster and Homo erectus as having occurred\nin Java over a million years ago. Chinese Homo erectus fossils date between 800,000 to 400,000\nyears ago. Homo sapiens began to leave Africa around 40,000 years ago, and hunter gatherers\nappeared in China by the end of the last Ice Age (36,000 to 16,000 BCE) as continental ice in\ncentral Asia began to melt.\n7 Clive Gamble, Timewalkers: Prehistory of Global Colonization (Bath, Avon: The Bath Press, 1993), 125-128.\nPage | 6 CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY\nEurope\nAnimal bones and pebble tools place hominids near Rome just before the beginning of the\nMiddle Pleistocene (730,000 years ago). This seems to be the first hominid incursion into\nEurope. Hominid remains in Spain suggest colonization in Iberia up to two million years ago,\nbut there are not nearly enough remains (no more than twenty inhabitants in any given site) to\nprovide any certainty in terms of which hominids they correspond to or when they lived there.\nEither way, colonization of Europe can be considered \u201clate.\u201d This tardiness may have been related\nto a lack of animal food sources. Not until around 500,000 years ago did \u201cnew species of deer,\nbovid, rhino, and horse appear\u201d 8 in Europe. Around the same time, the cheetah, saber-tooth tiger,\nand dirk-tooth cat declined in the region, making more carcasses from the aforementioned species\navailable to hominid foragers.\nAustralia, Papua New Guinea, Sahul\nEvidence of tools from 30,000 years ago exists in Australia, and from even longer in New\nGuinea. The lack of \u201ca dry land crossing to Sahul\u201d (the land mass that once connected New Guinea\nand Australia) meant that an ocean journey of somewhere between sixty-five and 100 kilometers\nwas required from mainland Asia. This made Australians and New Guineans the first sea-going\ncolonizers. Once in Sahul, how humans populated Australia is still the subject of some debate\nbetween those who support the \u201ccoastal hugger\u201d theory and those who support the idea of popu-\nlation by \u201coverlanders.\u201d The more difficult of the two means of populating Australia is overland,\nas it is more arid than the coasts, and the evidence for tools overland is not as advanced as that\nfor the coast.\nPeopling the New World\nNorth and South America were the last continents to be settled by humans. Most scholars think\nthat the Americas were populated from Beringia over land. Around 12,000 years ago, mammoth\nhunting became more common and supported larger populations on both the Asian and American\nsides of Beringia, a landmass (now divided by the Bering Strait) which at that time connected\nNorth America and Asia. On the Asian side, outlines of houses with stone-lined hearths have been\nfound, remnants indicating permanent settlement that didn\u2019t necessarily have colonization as an\nend goal. But colonize they did, one group pushing southward between 10,000 and 3,000 years\nago and establishing settlements that would become the origins of modern Korean, Japanese,\nChinese, and Inuit populations. Another group migrated southeastward through Alaska, their\ndescendants making it as far as Chile and Argentina.\nWhile we know about when American colonization began, the pace and means of coloniza-\ntion are still debated. Complicating the discussion of timing is the fact that the Late Wisconsin\nIce sheet blocked the overland route from about 30,000 years ago, when two sheets merged,\nup until about 12,000 years ago, when they opened after a thaw. At this point in time, only a\nhandful of sites support possible pre-10,000 BCE occupation: Monte Verde in Chile, Meadowcraft\nnear Pittsburgh, and Page-Ladson in Florida. As recently as 2015, excavations at Monte Verde and\n8 Ibid., 135.\nPage | 7 Chinchihuapi have strengthened the \u201cpossibility of an earlier human presence on the continent\u201d\nto as far back as 17,000 BCE. This date has continued to move back in time as archeologists\nconsider evidence of more mobile humans who did not leave large artifact clusters because of\ntheir ephemeral nature, but nonetheless may have been present before more sedentary groups.\nFor now, however, the\nclearest evidence for when\nthe Americas were widely\npopulated comes through\nthe Clovis point, a specific\narrowhead shape that was\nunique in its ubiquity and so-\nphistication. The Clovis point\nwas also found in mammoths\nthat had grown extinct by\n10,500 years ago, this discovery\nmeaning that humans were\ncommon in North America by\nthen. From Beringia, humans\nmoved at a rate of roughly 10\nmiles a year until they reached\nTierra del Fuego and fully\npopulated the Americas (with\nMap 1.3 | Geomorphological Context of the Monte Verde Site\nthe exception of some tropical Author: Tom Dillehay\nareas mentioned above).9 Source: PLOS\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\nThe Arctic\nThe first Paleo-Eskimo populations appeared around 4,000 years ago after arriving from\nEastern Siberia, populations that were left behind by the American colonists already mentioned.\nThe Arctic climate is harsh, to say the least, and these populations needed sophisticated weapons\nand tools to be able to survive it, which explains their late arrival.\nThe Arctic colonists expanded rapidly across Alaska, through Canada, and into Greenland,\nassisted by their arctic \u201csmall tool kits\u201d that included the important toggle headed harpoons to\nkill walrus and seal.\nPolynesian origins\nThe origins of Polynesian humans are still very much in doubt. Groups of Polynesian mariners\nhad existed 50,000 years ago, but they were not colonizers. In fact, many scholars argue that\neventual colonization actually began as exploration. Around 2,500 years ago, we see more\npermanent settlements in Fiji, Tonga, and other areas of the \u201cremote\u201d Pacific, as remnants of pottery\n9 Dillehay TD, Ocampo C, Saavedra J, Sawakuchi AO, Vega RM, Pino M, et al.

Based on linguis-\ntic and technological similarities among\nPolynesian cultures, some scholars\nargue that Fiji, Somoa, and Tonga were a\ncrucible of sorts where Polynesians were\n\u201cmade\u201d from groups from throughout\nAsia. Once these cultural groups had a\ncertain identity, they began to colonize\nEaster Island, Hawaii, and New Zealand\nabout and beyond 1,000 CE.\nWe can\u2019t use land migration patterns\nto understand oversea migration. The\nPacific was somewhat of a highway,\nwhere currents and winds were well-\nknown and frequently used by mariners.\nMigrating humans were much more\nlikely to wander aimlessly on land than\nthey were to let currents take them to\nMap 1.4 | Polynesian Migration\nunknown parts of the ocean. Pacific Author: David Eccles\nmariners tacked to use the winds in their Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY 3.0\nfavor and, despite population pressures,\nPacific mariners were too adept at\nseafaring to suggest a simple casting out of people into the Pacific in hopes of finding something.\nOnce Pacific colonization did commence, settlers were very deliberate about it, taking with them\nfamilies, and plants, and animals. It seems that they had every intention of recreating \u201chome.\u201d In\nsum, the exploration was neither extremely heroic nor extremely risky but instead was calculated\nand not left to chance.\n1.5.3 Hunter-gatherers\nChapter Two explores the importance of farming to the creation and expansion of early civili-\nzations. However, farming was only invented 13,000 years ago, meaning that for most of human\nhistory, our food has come through foraging. Early hominids like australopithecines, Homo\nhabilis, and Homo erectus ate mostly plant food. Homo sapiens became more sophisticated\nforagers as they began to fish with hooks and, more recently, nets, and as they used stone grinding\ntools to produce flour.\nAs food gathering techniques evolved for these Paleolithic foragers, so did their behavior as\norganized groups. Modern humans became mobile to prevent resource depletion; they controlled\npopulation through dispersion or infanticide, and they began to \u201clive and work cooperatively.\u201d\nModern foragers also began to divide tasks and share food with others, a feature that distin-\nguishes them from other animals like chimpanzees that live in communities but feed individually.\nPage | 9 Sharing food is, of course, much easier to do when there is a surplus, and, with increasing tool\nuse, Paleolithic humans became even more adept at foraging, leading to the higher likelihood of\nfood surpluses.\nTool use not only helped humans live cooperatively, but it also may have helped hominids\ndevelop abstract thought\u2014evidence of tool use may give us a clue as to when this development\nbegan. We know that other animals use tools, but even as long as 2.6 million years ago, we see\nevidence of the creative thinking required to make more effective tools. Homo habilis in fact\ntakes its name (\u201chandy man\u201d) from the fact that they were the first known hominid tool-makers.\nSoon after individual tools appeared, the Oldowan Industry became the first widely used toolset,\n\u201cconsisting of flaked and smashed quartz\nriverside pebbles made into poorly formed\nchoppers and sharp stone flakes, [and]\nlasted for 1 million years with little change\n[from 2.6 to 1.5 million years ago].\u201d 10 The\nOldowan were followed about 1.5 million\nyears ago by hand axes that remained\nunchanged for more than a million years.\nMany scholars argue that these small-\ner-brained hominids like Homo habilis,\nhomo ergaster, and Australopithecus\nwere both unable and unwilling to\ninnovate much beyond their simple but\neffective tools, especially considering how\nharsh their environment could become.\nFire was another important tool, first\nFigure 1.1 | Paleolithic Chopper\nused by Homo erectus about 1.6 million\nAuthor: User \u201cArchaeodontosaurus\u201c\nSource: Wikimedia Commons years ago. Fire would become important\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 to migrants to colder climes in Europe\nand Asia and to foragers who could now\neat foods that were poisonous if ingested raw. Homo erectus also cooked foods they had previously\neaten raw, thereby expanding their lifespan by eliminating toxins found in raw meats.\nHomo sapiens would add more meat to their diet when advances in tool-making led to an\nincrease in big game hunting during the late Pleistocene. For example, excavations near Dolni\nVetoni\u00e7e in the Czech Republic have helped reveal a society that \u201cused mammoth remains not\nonly for meat, but for fuel, construction, jewelry, and portable art.\u201d The inhabitants of Dolni\nVetoni\u00e7e also made thousands of ceramic figurines, bird bone flutes, and ivory carvings of human\nheads. The cave paintings of Lascaux also reflect this increased skill as hunters and painters both.\nThe colors and types of paint they used were vibrant and durable, and the scenes they depicted\ndemonstrated their use of diverse hunting techniques. There we see depictions of humans hunting\nnot only deer, but also woolly rhinoceros and mammoths.\n10 Ristvet, 17-22.\nPage | 10 CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY\nAlso at Lascaux, we see evidence that hunter-gatherers had both religious beliefs and gender\nspecific tasks, reflecting a sophistication that we usually only attribute to sedentary humans. The\nfact the humans and animals were depicted together so often at Lascaux may be evidence of a\nbelief that man descended from these animals. Or perhaps the bison, rhinoceri, and birds were\npainted on the walls to produce \u201chunting magic\u201d designed to make expeditions more successful.\nFinally, it was mostly men depicted in these higher-risk hunting activities, suggesting that women\nwere the artists, participated less in the hunt, or both.\nCloser to the Neolithic era, societies began to experience a growing role for women reflected\nthrough their representation in \u201cVenus\u201d statuettes. (See Figure 1.5) As we get closer to the Neolithic\nera, we see the relative role of women increasing; their place in ritual increases, their stature\nincreases, their economic importance increases, and their childbearing uniqueness becomes more\ngreatly emphasized.\nIncreased sophistica-\ntion was not limited to big\ngame hunters, however.\nCampsites, rock art, and\nburial sites near Lake\nMungo in Australia reveal\nhow these early humans\nused pottery for cooking\nand had a diverse diet of\nbirds, fish, and shellfish,\na diet that seems to have\nkept them well-nourished.\n11 Australia was a society\nof hunter-gatherers until\nEuropean colonization.\nMobility was essential,\nwith the continent\u2019s lack\nFigure 1.2 | Bull, Bird, and Human from Lascaux Cave\nof widespread rainfall and Author: User \u201cPeter80\u201d\nrich soil.

Tasmanians would ambush wallabies at their seasonal\ngrazing territory, while aborigines in the central deserts had to know when water holes would go\ndry. We also learn from the remains of Australian aborigines that foragers could be quite complex\nif they continued to hunt and gather for thousands of years. Aborigines painted, developed\nadvanced weapons like the boomerang, warred against one another, developed creation myths,\npassed down oral histories, and played musical instruments.\n11 Ibid., 27-30.\nPage | 11 1.6 AGRICULTURE AND THE \u201cNEOLITHIC REVOLUTION\u201d\nHistorian Lauren Ristvet defines agriculture as the \u201c\u2018domestication\u2019 of plants\u2026 causing it to\nchange genetically from its wild ancestor in ways [that make] it more useful to human consum-\ners.\u201d12 She and hundreds of other scholars from Hobbes to Marx have pointed to the Neolithic\nRevolution, that is, the move from a hunter-gatherer world to an agricultural one, as the root of\nwhat we today refer to as civilization. Without agriculture we don\u2019t have empires, written language,\nfactories, universities, or railroads. Despite its importance, much remains unclear about why and\nwhere agriculture began. Instead, scholars hold a handful of well-regarded theories about the\nroots (pun intended) of agriculture.\nMost scholars agree that the Ice Age played a fundamental role in the rise of agriculture,\nin the sense that it was impossible during the much colder and often tundra-covered period of\nthe Pleistocene, but inevitable during the Holocene thawing. Only 4,000 years before the origins\nof agriculture, the planting of anything would have been an exercise in futility. During the Last\nGlacial Maximum (24,000 \u2013 16,000 years ago), average temperatures dropped \u201cby as much as\n57\u02da F near the great ice sheets\u2026\u201d13 This glaciation meant not only that today\u2019s fertile farmlands\nof Spain or the North American Great Plains were increasingly covered in ice, but also that other\nareas around the world could not depend on constant temperatures or rainfall from year to year.\nPleistocene foragers had to be flexible. The warming trend of the Holocene, by contrast, resulted\nin consistent rainfall amounts and more predictable temperatures. The warming also altered the\nhabitats of the megafauna that humans hunted, alterations that in some cases contributed to their\nextinction. Therefore, as animal populations declined, humans were further encouraged to plant\nand cultivate seeds in newly-thawed soil.\nWhen we start to examine other factors that allowed humans to transition to agriculture, we\nfind that the climate factor looms even larger. For example, agriculture was usually accompa-\nnied by sedentarism, but we see communal living and permanent settlements among multiple\ngroups of hunter-gatherers. Homo sapiens had also begun to domesticate animals and plants\nalike during the Pleistocene. Humans were already being buried alongside dogs as early as 14,000\nyears ago.14 As we\u2019ll see below, gatherers were developing an increasing taste for grains long\nbefore they would abandon a foraging lifestyle. Essentially, humans were ready for agriculture\nwhen climate permitted it.\nWe discuss elsewhere the timing of agriculture\u2019s appearance in all of the continents, but\ngenerally speaking by about 8,000 years ago, farmers in West Asia were growing rye, barley, and\nwheat. In northern China, millet was common 8,500 years ago. In the Americas, the domestication\nof maize began around 8,000 years ago in Mesoamerica, while at about the same time, Andean\nresidents began cultivating potatoes. Once all of these areas realized agriculture\u2019s potential as a\npermanent food source, they began to adapt their societies to increase their crop consistency and\ncrop yields. We\u2019ll discuss how agriculture affected societal development below.\n12 Ibid., 36.\n13 Ibid., 36-37.\n14 Chris Scarre, ed.

However, the incubator of\nMesopotamian and Fertile Crescent agriculture and cultural patterns dated back to the foragers of\nthe nearby Eastern Mediterranean, thousands of\nyears before. The rye, barley, and wheat in West\nAsia were first harvested by late Pleistocene\nforagers called the Kebarans who ground wild\nwheat and barley into a porridge.15 Kebarans\nconsumed the porridge as part of their broad\nspectrum diet that also included land mammals,\nbirds, and fish. Advancing into the Holocene\nwe see the \u201cNatufian Adaptation,\u201d where\nresidents of this same area began to see the\nbenefits of sedentary living in a precursor to the\nadvent of agriculture. The Natufians consumed\nthe same rye, barley, and wheat that their\nKebaran predecessors had, but because their\nteeth were well-worn it appears they ate relative-\nly more of it. Having a constant source of these\ngrains enabled their eschewing long hunting\nor gathering soujourns; instead, the Natufians\ndrew more of their meat from in and around\nMap 1.5 | Natufian Spread\nLake Huleh in modern Israel.

Rather than migrating out of the\narea, the Abu Hureyrans cultivated rye. Soon afterward, other sites in the Levant began to see the\nplanting of barley, while wheat was cultivated in both the Levant and Anatolia.16\n1.6.2 First Permanent Settlements in West Asia [of the Fertile Crescent]\nThe transition from foraging, to collecting to cultivating took place over several centuries, but\nthese gradual changes did serve to mark a very distinct era of permanent settlement during the\nNeolithic Period. Increased rainfall around 9600 BCE meant that the Jordan River would swell\n15 Ristvet, 41.\n16 Ristvet, 41-42.\nPage | 13 yearly, in the process depositing layers of fertile soil\nalong its banks. This fertile soil allowed locals to rely\non agriculture for survival. Soon after they founded\nJericho just north of the Dead Sea: \u201cperhaps the\nvery first time in human history that a complete-\nly viable population was living in the same place\nat the same time.\u201d17 By Jericho\u2019s height, around\n9000 BCE, the settlements population reached the\nhundreds. This increase cannot be considered an\nurban boom of course, and the transition away from\nforaging occurred gradually. For example, excava-\ntions from this area have unearthed no separation\nof tasks or dwellings by gender or skill. However,\nby the end of Jericho\u2019s development, maintain-\ning large populations in one place would prove to\nproduce other extensive adjustments.18\nJericho\u2019s residents did distinguish themselves\nfrom their hunter-gatherer predecessors, however,\nMap 1.6 | The Jordan River\nthrough their relatively extensive construction\nAuthor: User \u201cInteriot\u201d\nprojects. They used mud bricks to build a wall that Source: Wikimedia Commons\nencircled the settlement probably for flood control, License: Public Domain\na tower, and separate buildings for grain storage.\nThe former foragers now living at Jericho could rely on fish or other aquatic creatures for\nmeat as they experimented with permanent settlement, but those foragers living further away\nfrom large bodies of water would need another source of meat. This need increasingly was met\nby animal domestication. Domestication would prove to be a slow process, as humans learned\nthe hard way that zebras bite, impalas are claustrophobic, and bighorn sheep do not obey orders.\nIn other words, some animals cannot be domesticated, but this is information only under-\nstood through trial and error. By about 7,500 BCE, however, humans in the Taurus and Zagros\nmountains employed selective breeding to eventually domesticate mountain sheep and goats. The\ntemperament and size of pigs and cows delayed their domestication until the 6,000s BCE, but this\nprocess proved equally, if not more important, than that of sheep and goats.\nAs agriculture and animal domestication progressed, settlements around the Mediterranean\nbecame larger and more sophisticated. By 7,000 BCE on the Anatolian plateau, \u00c7atalh\u00fcy\u00fck\nreached several thousands of inhabitants. The residents at \u00c7atalh\u00fcy\u00fck buried their dead, con-\nstructed uniform adjacent houses with elaborate designs painted on their interior walls, and\nhad multiple workshops where (among other activities) they wove baskets, and made obsidian\nmirrors as well as daggers with \u201ccarved bone handles.\u201d19 Catalh\u00fcy\u00fck denizens wove wool into\n17 Steven Mithen, After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000 \u2013 5,000 BC.

The appearance of these two settlements was accompanied by the increasing presence\nof village life across the world. Most early agricultural villages in Southwest Asia and around the\nworld were very similar in appearance; they had around twenty residents and were organized\naround grain cultivation and storage. Small huts were organized in a \u201cloose circle,\u201d and grain silos\nwere placed between each hut. Labor was a communal activity, and village members all spent\ntime hoeing the fields or hunting. The most valuable asset to a community was the grain itself, but\nneither it nor the land where it grew it belonged to one individual.\nThis model existed for hundreds and even thousands of years in some areas, until the villages\nstopped hunting and domesticated animals. For many scholars, the abandonment of hunting\nrepresents the \u201creal\u201d Neolithic Revolution. As communities completely abandoned hunting and\nPage | 15 gathering, they dedicated more energy to warfare, religion, and construction; in consequence,\ndwellings and settlements grew, along with a concomitant focus on tool and weapon making.20\n1.6.3 Leaving Paleolithic Culture Behind\nWhile the Neolithic Era is described in greater detail elsewhere, it is important to understand\nPaleolithic and Neolithic differences in order to convey a sense of just how revolutionary the shift\nto agriculture was for humanity. For example, agriculture contributed to (along with religion and\ntrade) the development of class. Before agriculture,\nhunter-gatherers divided tasks like seed gathering,\ngrinding, or tool-making. However, without large scale\nbuilding projects like aqueducts or canals required\nfor agriculture, hierarchies were much less pro-\nnounced. The intensification of agriculture during the\nNeolithic required irrigation, plowing, and terracing,\nall of which were labor intensive. The amount of\nlabor required could not be met through simple task\ndivision; someone had to be in charge. This meant the\nestablishment of ruling elites, a societal grouping that\nhad not existed during the Paleolithic.\nWhile violence certainly existed during the\nPaleolithic period, organized warfare was an invention\nof the Neolithic. Agriculture meant larger popula-\ntions and settlements that were more tightly packed\nand closer to one another. These closer quarters\ncreated new social and economic pressures that could\nproduce organized violence. Agricultural intensifica-\ntion produced stores of food and valuables that could\nbe seized by neighbors. During the 9,000s BCE, set-\ntlements like Jericho began to build defensive walls,\nwhile skeletons unearthed in the area reveal wounds\nfrom new types of projectiles (like the Khiam Point)\nFigure 1.4 | Khiam Point from Nahal Hemar\nAuthor: User \u201cIllujanka\u201d developed during the era.21\nSource: Wikimedia Commons Family life also changed significantly during the\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nNeolithic. Sedentary communities invested more time\nand resources into the construction of permanent homes\nhousing nuclear families. People spent less time with the community as a whole and within homes it\nbecame easier to accumulate wealth and keep secrets.\nThe shift in gender roles after agriculture seems to be even more pronounced, as the role of\nwomen became more important as humans moved out of the Paleolithic and into the Neolithic era.\n20 Ristvet, 66.\n21 Scarre, 192, 215.\nPage | 16 CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY\nDuring the Paleolithic Era,\nand until recently in fact,\na child would be breastfed\nuntil he or she was three or\nfour years old, a necessity\npreventing mothers\nfrom joining long-dis-\ntance hunting expeditions\nwithout their toddlers.\nHowever, a breastfeeding\nwoman could complete\ntasks that \u201cdon\u2019t require\nrapt concentration, are rel-\natively dull and repetitive;\nthey are easily interrupt-\nFigure 1.5 | Different types of carved Venus figurines, Anthropos Museum,\ned, don\u2019t place the child in\nBrno, Czech Republic\ndanger, and don\u2019t require Author: Mercy from Wikimedia Commons\nthe participant to stray far Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nfrom home.\u201d22 Spinning,\nweaving, and sewing were\nsome of these tasks. Also, the essential tasks of preparing food and clothing could be accomplished\nwith a nursing toddler nearby. These tasks that may be consigned as \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d today are\namong the most important tasks (and very time consuming ones before the industrial revolution)\nthat a human could perform. In fact, they were so time consuming that women would spend most\nof their day on them, often being assisted by men.\nOver time, Paleolithic women gathered new species of berries as well as bird eggs, and learned\nwhich mushrooms were nontoxic. Women also were the principal gatherers of mosses for sleeping\nmats and other plants for shelter. When men returned with a kill, the women then began an involved\nprocess of dressing and butchering it. Sinews from animals and fibers from plants became rope to\ntie or fasten the hides as well as baskets. Women thus were essential to any kind of productivity or\nprogress associated with hunting. Women used sinews and fibers to create netting for transport and\nfor hunting and fishing. In hunting societies with elements of horticulture, women were respon-\nsible for, and could provide, such food as legumes, eggs, and grains. Food gathering and weaving,\nespecially in the dry Mediterranean, was an outdoor and community activity that also served as a\npreschool and apprentice system for children. So women were also community educators.\nNeolithic Women\nWhile Paleolithic women certainly had important responsibilities, the added tasks of herding\nand animal domestication expanded their roles tremendously in the Neolithic era. Neolithic\n22 Elizabeth Wayland Barber, Women\u2019s Work: The First 20,000 Years \u2013 Women, Cloth and Society in Early Times, (New\nYork: Norton, 1995), 30.\nPage | 17 survival required not only effective food storage, but also increased production. Children on a\nfarm can be more helpful and put in less danger than those on a hunt. Neolithic women increas-\ningly bore more children, either because of increased food production or to help augment it. This\nincrease in child bearing may also have offset an increase in mortality due, for example, to disease.\nBecause dangers from disease grew in new villages due to the ease with which deadly diseases\nspread in close quarters, and nearby domesticated animals whose diseases spread from animal to\nhumans, more children would be necessary to replace those who had succumbed to illness.\nWhile Neolithic women carried an increased child-bearing responsibility, their other respon-\nsibilities did not necessarily wane. Though women may not have fired pottery when it began to\nappear some 6,000 years ago, they appeared on it in decorative symbols of female fertility. Around\n4,000 BCE, gendered tasks shifted again with the domestication of draft animals. Food produc-\ntion once again became men\u2019s domain, as herding was incompatible with childrearing. Later, in\nNeolithic herding societies, women were often responsible for the actual domestication of feral\nbabies, nursing them and raising them. Men would shear sheep, help weave, market the textiles,\nand cultivate the food that was prepared in the home.\nWe should say that this was not the case with all agricultural societies, as many horticultural-\nists who were able to cultivate crops closer to home were able to remain matrilineal. For example,\nwe have the case of Minoan women on the Mediterranean island of Crete that we discuss in more\ndetail in Chapter Five. On Crete\u2019s hilly terrain, women were able to cultivate terraced horticul-\nture and keep herds of sheep and goats nearby. Therefore, as women lost power and influence\nelsewhere due to more intensive agriculture, Minoan women actually expanded their control over\nCrete\u2019s economic and cultural life and would help give rise to Classical Greece.\n1.6.4 Toward First Civilizations\nWe will discuss the Bronze Age elsewhere, but we should mention here that new pursuits like\nmining added to the domestic burden on women. The advent of the Bronze Age led to far-spread\nsearching and mining for copper and other metals like arsenic or tin to harden it and create the\nbronze alloy. Mining consequently become a male pursuit. Between 9,000 and 4,000 BCE, as\nmetal become a source for wealth and subsistence, men\u2019s roles shifted from being secondary to\nbeing both the food collectors and the economic backbone of individual families and societies.\nThese Neolithic developments in sedentary agriculture and village life would be the foundation\nfor an explosion of cultural development three thousand years later in Egypt and Mesopotamia\n(addressed later in this text). By the Age of Exploration in the 1500s CE, most of the world had\nadopted agriculture as a primary means of subsistence, and the foundation of great civilizations.\n1.7 SUMMARY\nThe story of world civilizations really begins six to eight million years ago when ancestors of\nmodern humans began to walk upright. Millions of years of evolutionary response to changing\nclimates and environment led to the existence of our species, Homo sapiens. While other\nPage | 18 CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY\nhominids migrated out of Africa, had language, and made fire and tools, it was Homo sapiens\nwho were able to navigate open oceans and eventually populate the entire planet. Over the last\n50,000 years or so, Homo sapiens became modern humans by improving their hunting, their\nbuilding techniques, their community living, and their food gathering and storage. About 10,000\nyears ago, the Neolithic Era began. Humans began to live in larger, permanent settlements where\na permanent food source needed to be nearby. These were the beginnings of agriculture. This\n\u201cagricultural revolution\u201d deeply affected gender relationships, class distinctions, and economic\npriorities as most humans left their foraging days behind them, the importance of which will be\ndiscussed in later chapters.\n1.8 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBradley, Bruce and Dennis Stanford. \u201cA Possible Paleolithic Route to the New World.\u201d World Archaelolgy\n36 no. 4 (Dec., 2004): 459-478.\nDillehay TD, Ocampo C, Saavedra J, Sawakuchi AO, Vega RM, Pino M, et al.

Civilization, however, is a tricky term. In\nthe United States, students of history studied Western Civilization, almost exclusively, through\nthe 1950s. In their studies, civilizations were advanced societies with urban centers, rooted in\nEuropean or Middle Eastern culture. America\u2019s origins in these western civilizations was used\nto explain our own high level of development. However, more recent scholars have definitely\nbroadened the geographical focus by recognizing that worldwide from 3500 to 1000 BCE at least\nseven independent civilizations emerged in different regions. These recent scholars also continue\nto debate the definition of civilization, and the current compromise amongst World Historians\nis to recognize characteristics that civilizations tended to share. Common characteristics of\ncivilizations included food surpluses, higher population densities, social stratification, systems of\ntaxation, labor specialization, regular trade, and accumulated learning (or knowledge passed down\nfrom generation to generation). The list here is not all-inclusive by any means, but it indicates the\ncomplexity of the societies that scholars have labeled civilizations.\nIn addition to heated debates about its exact definition, civilization is a loaded term, meaning\nthat it can contain a value judgment. If we use the term carelessly, it seems to indicate that some\nsocieties are deemed civilized and worthy of inclusion, while others are uncivilized and thus\nnot worth our study. In part, our sensitivity to this issue is a response to the tendency of past\nhistorians, including many of those working in Europe in the 1800s, to assume that there was a\nPage | 22 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nnatural progression from an uncivilized state to civilization. These historians viewed people who\nhad values, ways of living, and religious beliefs different than theirs as uncivilized. They further\nbelieved that these allegedly uncivilized peoples were behind or needed to catch up with those who\nwere civilized. Today, World Historians try to appreciate the great diversity of human experiences\nand consciously remove these sorts of value judgments. World Historians avoid assumptions\nthat some societies in the past were better or further along than others. Therefore, many World\nHistorians remain wary of the uncritical use of the term civilization.\nFor our purposes, let us leave aside any value judgments. Societies labeled as civilizations\nwere not inherently better than any others. In fact, as we will see, civilizations demonstrated\nvarious vulnerabilities. Considering things like war, slavery, and the spread of diseases, there\nwere sometimes advantages to living outside the nexus of civilizations. For example, in comparing\nsocieties, scholars have found that in many instances people residing in decentralized states were\nhealthier and lived longer than did their counterparts in early civilizations. However, people\nliving in societies with social stratification, labor specialization, and trade usually left more\nwritten records and archeological evidence, which historians can analyze to narrate our past. The\navailable resources mean that civilizations tend to be better represented in the written historical\nrecords. As you read about past civilizations, keep in mind that historians are currently enhancing\nour understanding of societies that perhaps remained mobile, rejected hierarchies, or preserved\ntheir histories orally. These societies were also part of our shared past, even if they are harder to\nstudy or have received less scholarly attention.\nThis chapter focuses on early civilizations in the Fertile Crescent and Northeast Africa.\nThe civilizations in these regions left written records. They also all initially had economies based\non farming and developed alongside rivers. Their locations alongside rivers allowed populations\nin the Fertile Crescent and Northeast Africa to grow the surplus food that they used to support\nurbanization, social stratification, labor specialization, and trade.\n2.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

Archeologists have found some\nof the earliest known sites of agricultural production in the Fertile Crescent. Although much of this\nregion received little or irregular rainfall, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers provided large amounts\nof freshwater, facilitating agricultural production and the development of early civilizations. The\nGreeks later recognized the significance of the river systems to these ancient societies and referred\nto the region as \u201cthe Land between the\nRivers\u201d or Mesopotamia.\nThe Tigris and Euphrates Rivers\nboth originate in the Taurus Mountains\nof eastern Anatolia and flow southward\nto empty into the Persian Gulf. The\nrivers carry and deposit silt downstream,\nenriching the soil. In general, the richer\nsoils and availability of water in areas that\nin the north otherwise had little rain, or\nelse towards the south had concentrated\nmonths of rainfall followed by long, dry\nspells, encouraged settlement near the\nrivers. The areas closer to the Persian\nGulf, known as Lower Mesopotamia,\nin particular, were attractive to early\nsettlers because they had extremely\nfertile soils. People built some of the\nearliest cities, including Uruk, Eridu,\nand Ur, in Lower Mesopotamia.\nWhile the Tigris and Euphrates\nRivers did provide water to the region,\ntheir floods were unpredictable and could\nMap 2.1 | The Fertile Crescent\neven be catastrophic when they washed Author: User \u201cRas67\u201d\naway entire settlements. In response, the Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 25 region\u2019s residents created irrigation canals and drainage ditches to control the flow of water. They\nalso stored water in reservoirs to use during the dry months of the year. Additionally, in parts of\nLower Mesopotamia, the courses of the rivers and their tributaries changed frequently, so people\neither had to move to follow the water\u2019s new path or divert a river to continue supplying water\nfor their settlement. As regular access to water supported agricultural surpluses and population\ngrowth, people tended to fare better against the unpredictability of the floods, seasonal changes,\nand the rivers\u2019 changing courses when they lived in settlements capable of maintaining irrigation\ncanals, drainage ditches, and water reservoirs.\nThe rivers offered\nanother benefit to ancient\nMesopotamians. Just as\nthe rivers were definitely\nimportant to meet people\u2019s\neveryday needs for water and\nfor agricultural production,\nso they also facilitated trade.\nWhile people made use of\nlocal resources, like mud to\nbuild their homes, in general,\nLower Mesopotamia lacked\nother desired resources,\nincluding wood, stone, and\nprecious metals. Traders\nMap 2.2 | Trade Routes in Early Mesopotamia | In the third\nwere able to use the rivers millennium BCE, people in Lower Mesopotamia used river routes to trade\nto bring in these resources northward. They also used sea routes through the Persian Gulf, and they\nconnected with traders to the east by crossing the Iranian Plateau.\nfrom Assyria, Anatolia, the\nAuthor: Corey Parson\nLevant, and areas adjacent Source: Original Work\nto the Persian Gulf.

Merchants used overland\nroutes that crossed the Iranian Plateau and sea routes, exchanging Mesopotamian products like\ngrains and textiles for luxury goods from the east. Royal cemeteries show that by 2500 BCE\nMesopotamian elites were buried with a variety of imports, including beads brought from the\nIndus River Valley. The rivers and the overland trade routes also facilitated communication and,\nwith it, the sharing of ideas and technologies.\n2.6 SUMERIAN CITY-STATES\nLower Mesopotamia, or the southern areas of Mesopotamia towards the Persian Gulf,\ndrew settlers, who moved to take advantage of rich soils and the availability of water in the\narea commonly known as Sumer. The people who lived in Sumer are generally referred to as\nPage | 26 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nSumerians. Prior to 3,000 BCE, Sumerians, whose origins remain a subject of debate, founded a\nnumber of independent cities in Lower Mesopotamia. In these cities, Sumerians had organized\nreligions, centralized governments, social hierarchies, and access to trade networks. As these\ncities expanded, their leaders claimed control over adjacent territories, forming at least a dozen\ncity-states, which became the basic organizational structure of Sumerian civilization in the third\nmillennium BCE. By incorporating the surrounding territories into city-states, urban centers were\nable to draw on more resources.\nSumerian cities had certain characteristics in common. First, a temple complex or a ziggurat\nwas usually the visual focus of the urban landscape. Sumerians believed that their entire city\nbelonged to its main deity, and built a massive temple, the most important building in the city, to\nbe the dwelling place of their city\u2019s main god or goddess. A complex that comfortably housed many\nof the priests and priestesses who served the city\u2019s deity surrounded each temple. In addition to\nattending to the religious needs of the community, temples complexes also owned land, managed\nindustries, were involved in trade, and acted as banks. Their wide-ranging roles meant that temples\noften had additional outbuildings, like granaries and storage sheds, in the surrounding countryside.\nSumerians were polytheistic, meaning they worshipped multiple gods and goddesses. Because\nSumerians believed each god had a family, they also built smaller shrines and temples dedicated\nto these divine family members. Therefore, each city would have a number of temples while many\nSumerian homes had small altars dedicated to other gods. Sometimes, urban temples or ritual\nspaces were built atop a ziggurat, a solid rectangular tower made of sun-dried mud bricks.\nArchaeological evidence shows that\ntemple complexes were expanded and\nrebuilt over time and, by the late third\nmillennium BCE, temples in many of\nthe Sumerian city-states were raised on\nplatforms or else situated on a ziggurat.\nThe towering architecture of the ziggurat\nstressed the significance of the temple to\nthe surrounding community. The best-\npreserved ziggurat, the Great Ziggurat of\nUr, was constructed with an estimated\n720,000 baked bricks and rose to a\nheight of about 100 feet. The people of\nUr constructed this ziggurat for their\npatron deity, the moon goddess Nanna.\nFigure 2.1 | The Great Ziggurat of Ur | Located in what is\ntoday the Dhi Qar Province of Iraq, Sumerians originally built They likely brought regular offerings to\nthe ziggurat in the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2100 BCE).

Priests and priestesses collected\nand redistributed the offerings, demonstrating the vital roles they played in Sumerian society.\nThe relatively privileged position of priests and priestesses at the temple complex also shows\nSumerian social stratification (the development of a hierarchy) and how agricultural surpluses\nsupported the specialization of labor. Some of the early leaders of Sumerian cities may have been\n\u201cpriest-kings,\u201d who attained elevated positions through their association with the temples. The\nlater rulers of city-states definitely supported the temples, claiming to be acting on behalf of the\ngods who brought divine favor to their followers.\nSumerian city-states had local rulers, who lived in large palaces, but most of these local rulers\nwere not considered kings. So far, archeologists have dated the earliest known royal palaces to\nc. 2600 BCE and conclude that Sumerian city-states had centralized governments with secular\nrulers by at least that timeframe. While there does seem\nto have been a sense of inhabiting a shared space in\nSouthern Mesopotamia, referred to as \u201cthe Land\u201d in written\nrecords, city-states had distinctive identities. In part, their\ndistinctive identities revolved around their main deity.\nThe rulers of city-states alternately supported, competed\nwith, and fought against one another. The Sumerian\nKing List (Figure 2.2), a manuscript that listed early kings\nand described their reigns (with some presumably fictive\nand exaggerated elements), provides evidence of these\nalliances, competition, and war. For example, it describes\nEn-mebarages as the second to last king of the 1st Dynasty of\nKish, \u201c\u2026who carried away as spoil the weapons of the land of\nElam, became king, and reigned 900 years\u2026\u201d1 Local rulers\noften came to power after proving themselves militarily.\nFurthermore, the Sumerian King List recognized only\nrulers who had established control over multiple city-states\nas kings (with the title of lugal in the Sumerian language)\nbelonging to distinct dynasties. While it lasted, a dynasty\ngenerally passed down the kingship through the male line.\nAccording to the Sumerian King List, the seat of power, held\nby hereditary kings, shifted from city-state to city-state with\nFigure 2.2 | The Sumerian King List\nAuthor: Taiwania Justo the rise and fall of dynasties through the third millennium\nSource: Wikimedia Commons BCE. Significantly, the Sumerian King List began its\nLicense: Public Domain\nrecorded history \u201cwhen kingship came down from heaven,\u201d\nlegitimizing secular kings through their association with\ngods.2 Sumerian kings, often along with more local rulers, led armies, collected taxes, organized\nlabor for state projects, and meted out justice. At the top of the hierarchy and with control over\n1 J.N. Postgate, Early Mesopotamia: Society and Economy at the Dawn of History, (London: Routledge, 1994): 28.\n2 Ibid.\nPage | 28 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nmultiple city-states, kings expected obedience from local rulers and their subjects, and support\nfrom the priests and priestesses of the temples.\nKings, local rulers, priests, and priestesses held influential positions in Sumerian societies.\nHowever, farmers, taken as a whole, made up an estimated 90% of the population. Other skilled\npeople included animal-breeders, merchants, craftspeople, fishermen, doctors, soldiers, architects,\nand scribes. Surplus agricultural production collected as tribute as well as wealth generated by\ntrade supported such labor specialization. One important outcome of labor specialization was\ninnovation in metalworking. In approximately 2900 BCE, metalworkers began producing bronze,\nwhich was stronger than copper. Stronger weapons and farming tools gave Sumerians advantages\nwhen it came to combat and agricultural production.\nSocial stratification is further evident as some Sumerians and even institutions, including\ntemples, owned slaves. Slaves performed a variety of tasks like construction, weaving, agricultural\nand domestic labor, tending animals, and even administrative work as scribes. Some slaves were\nchattel slaves, meaning that society treated them as property with no rights. Usually, chattel slaves\nwere prisoners of war or slaves bought from outside communities. They were branded by barbers or\ntattoo artists and forced to work at the will of their masters. If they tried to run away, the law required\nslaves to be returned. The more widespread type of servitude in most Sumerians societies was likely\ndebt slavery, which was generally temporary until a debtor paid off a loan and its interest. Over the\npast century or so, archaeologists have added a great deal to our understanding of Sumerian social\ndistinctions through their work at\nnumerous excavation sites, but many\ngaps in our knowledge still exist.\nThe archaeological discovery of\ncuneiform tablets at these excavation\nsites has aided efforts to learn\nabout this civilization. Sumerians\ndeveloped cuneiform, a written\nscript of wedge shaped marks, around\n3200 BCE. Cuneiform was one of the\nearliest, if not the very first, written\nscript in the world. The Sumerian\nKing List, discussed above, was\nrecorded in cuneiform. Merchants,\nFigure 2.3 | Cuneiform | Cuneiform script on a clay tablet\nscribes, administrators, priests,\ncurrently housed at the National Archaeological Museum in Tehran.\nand others kept written records Author: A. Davey\ndescribing financial transactions, Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY 2.0\ncourt proceedings, administrative\ndecisions, and architectural plans.\nThey also wrote legends, epic poems, chants, and prayers. Most people were not literate, so\nscribes\u2014who had been specially trained in scribal schools\u2014generated many of the records. While\nin school, in addition to copying written passages, scribes learned arithmetic. The Sumerians\nPage | 29 system of arithmetic was based on the number 60, which we still use to divide time into hours,\nminutes, and seconds. Scribes used styluses made of reed to write on clay tablets that were dried\nand could be stored. The discovery of cuneiform tablets has greatly aided archaeologists, but only\na small percentage of the tablets found to date have been translated.\nUsing archaeological and written evidence, scholars have pieced together what they can about\neveryday life for Sumerians, though some questions remain. For instance, it has been a challenge\nto determine the layout of urban spaces beyond the prominence of the temples and the relative\ngrandeur of palaces. From archaeological finds, scholars suspect that Sumerian cities were divided\ninto neighborhoods by occupation and according to kinship groups, but uncertainties about\nspecifics linger. Legal documents and tax records show that people owned property in both the\ncities and the countryside. Also, evidence suggests social stratification, as some Sumerians owned\nfairly large chunks of land, while others had much smaller plots or presumably no land at all. Wills,\ncourt proceedings, and temple documents show that land and temple offices were usually bought\nor else acquired through military or other service to the state. A man inherited land, property,\noffices, and their attendant obligations to the state (like reoccurring military service) from his\nfather. The eldest son seems to have frequently inherited a larger share than younger brothers\nand have been given control over the family home. He was tasked with performing regular rituals\nto honor dead ancestors, who were usually buried underneath the home. From the written\ndocuments, we also get glimpses into other aspects of Sumerian life, like marriage and divorce.\nSumerians viewed marriage as a contract between two families and, as a result, the male heads\nof the two families arranged a couple\u2019s marriage. Documents show that both families contributed\nresources to seal the union or complete the marriage contract. The man\u2019s family gave gifts or\nmoney and hosted a feast, while the woman\u2019s family amassed a dowry. Although a woman did\nnot automatically receive an inheritance upon the death of her father, she could expect (and use\nthe court system to make sure she got) to receive a dowry, even if it came from her father\u2019s estate\nafter his death. Divorce was possible but sometimes led to social ostracism or even punishment\nif there were accusations of misconduct, such consequences being especially the case for the\nwoman. Records indicate that polygamy was not common, but wealthier men did keep slave-girls\nas concubines. Overall, Sumerians considered marriage an essential institution in that it brought\nfamilies together and ensured the continuation of the family lineage.\nLegends, myths, poems, and literary texts tell us about Sumerians, too. For example, we\ncan explore their values and views of the afterlife through reading the Epic of Gilgamesh. The\nEpic of Gilgamesh relates the adventures of Gilgamesh, a legendary king, who may have lived\naround 2700 BCE. The epic has multiple versions and was told orally before it was first written\ndown in cuneiform in about 2000 BCE. The epic follows the heroic exploits of Gilgamesh and his\ncompanion, Enkidu, to emphasize the importance of values such as loyalty and humility. In one\nsection, the epic describes a very gloomy afterlife where \u201cpeople see no light, they sit in darkness,\u201d3\nreflecting Mesopotamian beliefs that the afterlife was miserable for all, even those who had lived\nvirtuously. Additionally, it portrays the environment as potentially violent and hostile as in its\n3 Excerpt from: The Epic of Gilgamesh, trans.

For example, cuneiform\ntablets with pictures of dancers and singers, as\nwell as instruments found in graves, suggest\nthat Sumerians placed importance on music,\nusing it for entertainment and ritual purposes.\nTrying to learn more about Sumerian music,\nFigure 2.4 | The Queen\u2019s Lyre | The Queen\u2019s\nLyre is a reconstructed musical instrument modeled scholars and other enthusiasts have replicated\nafter a lyre found by archaeologist Leonard Wooley these instruments and presented their best\nin one of the graves at the Royal Cemetery of Ur.\nestimation of Sumerian scales and tuning.

Kings consolidated power over multiple city-states in the region. Then, King\nSargon of Akkad enlarged the scale by conquering the Sumerian city-states and parts of Syria, Anatolia,\nand Elam. In doing so, he created one of the world\u2019s first empires in approximately 2334 BCE. For\ngenerations, Mesopotamian literature celebrated the Akkadian Empire (c. 2334 \u2013 2100 BCE) that\nKing Sargon founded. Like the Akkadian Empire, three subsequent empires, the Babylonian Empire\n(c. 1792 \u2013 1595 BCE), the Assyrian Empire (c. 900 \u2013 612 BCE), and the Neo-Babylonian Empire (c.\n605 \u2013 539 BCE), also ruled large parts of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent.\n2.7.1 The Akkadian Empire (c. 2334 \u2013 2100 BCE)\nSargon of Akkad founded the first empire in Mesopotamia. Legends about Sargon of Akkad\nstress that he rose from obscurity to become a famous, powerful king. While the legends all tend\nto describe him as coming from humble origins and rising to the top using his own wits, there\nare many variations. One much later Babylonian tablet, from the seventh century BCE, describes\nhis background as descendent of a high priestess and an anonymous father. His mother hid her\npregnancy and the birth of Sargon, secreting him away in a wicker basket on a river, where he was\nPage | 31 Map 2.3 | The Akkadian Empire, c. 2300 BCE\nAuthor: User \u201cNareklm\u201d\nSource: Wikipedia\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nrescued and then raised by Aqqi, a water-drawer. This version of the legend links Sargon with a\nmore elite family through his birth-mother, a high priestess, but also shows how he had to advance\nhimself up to king after being adopted by the rather more humble figure of a water-drawer.\nFrom his allegedly humble origins, Sargon of Akkad conquered Sumerian city-states one by\none, creating an empire, or a large territory, encompassing numerous states, ruled by a single\nauthority. It\u2019s quite possible that Sargon of Akkad\u2019s predecessor, who claimed to rule over the large\nregion stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, began the process of building\nthe empire, but Sargon is remembered for accomplishing the task. One of the reasons we attribute\nthe empire to him is his use of public monuments. He had statues, stellae (tall, upright pillars),\nand other monuments built throughout his realm to celebrate his military victories and to build a\nsense of unity within his empire. Archaeologists have not found the empire\u2019s capital city, Akkad.\nHowever, from the available information, archaeologists have estimated its location, placing it to\nthe north of the early Mesopotamian city-states, including Ur and Sumer. It is clear that Sargon of\nAkkad turned the empire\u2019s capital at Akkad into one of the wealthiest and most powerful cities in the\nworld. According to documentary sources, the city\u2019s splendor stood as another symbol of Sargon\u2019s\ngreatness. The city grew into a cosmopolitan center especially because of its role in trade. Akkadian\nrulers seized and taxed trade goods, with trade routes extending as far as India. Sargon ruled the\nempire for over fifty years. His sons, grandson, and great grandson attempted to hold the empire\nPage | 32 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\ntogether. After about 200 years, attacks from neighboring peoples caused the empire to fall. After\nthe fall of the Akkadian Empire, Hammurabi founded the next empire in the region in 1792 BCE.\n2.7.2 The Babylonian Empire (1792 \u2013 1595 BCE)\nHammurabi, who aspired to follow Sargon\u2019s example, created the next empire in the region, the\nBabylonian Empire. With well-disciplined foot soldiers armed with copper and bronze weapons,\nhe conquered Mesopotamian city-states, including Akkad and Sumer, to create an empire with its\ncapital at Babylon. Although he had other achievements, Hammurabi is most famous for the law\ncode etched into a stele that bears his name, the Stele of Hammurabi.\nThe Stele of Hammurabi records a comprehensive set of laws. Codes of law existed prior to\nHammurabi\u2019s famous stele, but Hammurabi\u2019s Code gets a lot of attention because it is still\nintact and has proven very influential. As seen in Figure 2.5, the upper part of the stele depicts\nHammurabi standing in front of the Babylonian\ngod of justice, from whom Hammurabi derives\nhis power and legitimacy. The lower portion of\nthe stele contains the collection of 282 laws. One\nparticularly influential principle in the code is\nthe law of retaliation, which demands \u201can eye\nfor an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\u201d The code listed\noffenses and their punishments, which often\nvaried by social class. While symbolizing the\npower of the King Hammurabi and associating\nhim with justice, the code of law also attempted\nto unify people within the empire and establish\ncommon standards for acceptable behavior. An\nexcerpt of Hammurabi\u2019s Code appears below:\n6. If anyone steal the property of a temple\nor of the court, he shall be put to death,\nand also the one who receives the stolen\nthing from him shall be put to death.\n8. If any one steal cattle or sheep, or\nan ass, or a pig or a goat, if it belong to\na god or to the court, the thief shall pay\nthirtyfold therefore; if they belonged to a\nfreed man of the king he shall pay tenfold;\nif the thief has nothing with which to pay\nFigure 2.5 | The Stele of Hammurabi\nhe shall be put to death.

If any one receive into his house a runaway male or female slave of the court, or of a\nfreedman, and does not bring it out at the public proclamation of the major domus, the\nmaster of the house shall be put to death.\n53. If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and does not so keep it;\nif then the dam break and all the fields be flooded, then shall he in whose dam the break\noccurred be sold for money, and the money shall replace the corn which he has caused to\nbe ruined.\n108. If a tavern-keeper (feminine) does not accept corn according to gross weight in\npayment of drink, but takes money, and the price of the drink is less than that of the corn,\nshe shall be convicted and thrown into the water.\n110. If a \u201csister of god\u201d open a tavern, or enter a tavern to drink, then shall this woman be\nburned to death.\n127. If any one \u201cpoint the finger\u201d (slander) at a sister of a god or the wife of any one, and\ncan not prove it, this man shall be taken before the judges and his brow shall be marked.\n(by cutting the skin or perhaps hair)\n129. If a man\u2019s wife be surprised (in flagrante delicto) with another man, both shall be tied\nand thrown into the water, but the husband may pardon his wife and the king his slaves.\n137. If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him children, or from his\nwife who has borne him children: then he shall give that wife her dowry, and a part of the\nusufruct of field, garden, and property, so that she can rear her children. When she has\nbrought up her children, a portion of all that is given to the children, equal as that of one\nson, shall be given to her. She may then marry the man of her heart.\n195. If a son strike his father, his hands shall be hewn off.\n196. If a man put out the eye of another man his eye shall be put out. (An eye for an eye)\n197. If he break another man\u2019s bone, his bone shall be broken.\n198. If he put out the eye of a freed man, or break the bone of a freed man, he shall pay\none gold mina.\n199. If he put out the eye of a man\u2019s slave, or break the bone of a man\u2019s slave, he shall pay\none-half of its value.\nPage | 34 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\n202. If any one strike the body of a man higher in rank than he, he shall receive sixty blows\nwith an ox-whip in public.\n203. If a free-born man strike the body of another free-born man or equal rank, he shall\npay one gold mina.\n205. If the slave of a freed man strike the body of a freed man, his ear shall be cut off.4\nHammurabi also improved infrastructure, promoted trade, employed effective administrative\npractices, and supported productive agriculture. For example, he sponsored the building of roads\nand the creation of a postal service. He also maintained irrigation canals and facilitated trade\nall along the Persian Gulf. After Hammurabi\u2019s death, his successors lost territory. The empire\ndeclined, shrinking in size. The Hittites, from Anatolia, eventually sacked the city of Babylon in\n1595 BCE, bringing about the official end of the Babylonian Empire.\n2.7.3 The Assyrian Empire (c. 900 \u2013 612 BCE)\nThe Assyrian Empire, which saw its height of power at the end of the first millennium to the\nseventh century BCE, was larger than any empire that preceded it.\nDominating the region, its well-equipped soldiers used their stronger iron weapons to extend\nthe empire\u2019s control through Mesopotamia, Syria, parts of Anatolia, Palestine, and up the Nile\ninto Egypt. They used siege warfare, along with battering rams, tunnels, and moveable towers, to\nget past the defenses of cities. The Assyrians had a large army (with perhaps as many as 150,000\nsoldiers) that utilized a core of infantry, a cavalry, as well as chariots. As part of their military\nstrategy, the Assyrians purposefully tried to inspire fear in their enemies; they decapitated\nconquered kings, burnt cities to the ground, destroyed crops, and dismembered defeated enemy\nsoldiers. One Assyrian soldier claimed:\nIn strife and conflict I besieged [and] conquered the city. I felled 3,000 of their fighting\nmen with the sword\u2026I captured many troops alive: I cut off of some of their arms [and]\nhands; I cut off of others their noses, ears, [and] extremities. I gouged out the eyes of many\ntroops. I made one pile of the living [and] one of heads. I hung their heads on trees around\nthe city.5\nThe Assyrians expected these methods to deter potential rebellions and used their spoils of\nwar, like precious metals and livestock, to finance further military campaigns. After conquering\nan area, they conscripted men into their army, and employed resettlement and deportation as\ntechniques to get laborers where they wanted them and deal with communities who opposed\n4 \u201cThe Code of Hammurabi, c. 1780 BCE.\u201d Ancient History Sourcebook. Fordham University. https://legacy.fordham.edu/\nhalsall/ancient/hamcode.asp#text\n5 Quoted in Erika Belibtreau, \u201cGrisly Assyrian Record of Torture and Death,\u201d http://faculty.uml.edu/ethan_Spanier/\nTeaching/documents/CP6.0AssyrianTorture.pdf\nPage | 35 Map 2.4 | The Assyrian Empire at its height.\nAuthor: User \u201cNingyou\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\ntheir regime. They also collected annual tributes that were apparently high enough to, at least\noccasionally, spur rebellions despite the Assyrians\u2019 reputation for violent retribution.\nIn addition to its military strength, the Assyrian empire also stands out for the size of its cities and\nits administrative developments. The empire\u2019s biggest cities, such as Nineveh and Assur, each had\nseveral million people living within them. Administratively, kings ruled Assyria, appointing governors\nto oversee provinces and delegates to keep tabs on the leaders of allied states. There were between\n100 and 150 governors, delegates, and top officials entrusted by the king with ruling in his place and\nhelping him maintain the empire. In the later centuries of the Assyrian Empire, kings chose these\nofficials on the basis of merit and loyalty. Kings met with large groups of officials for rituals, festivals,\nand military campaigns. Evidence of such meetings has led some scholars to propose the possibility\nthat the king and his officials might have worked together in something resembling a parliamentary\nsystem, though there is no scholarly consensus on the point. Ultimately, the Assyrian Empire became\ntoo large to control; rebellions occurred with more frequency and were difficult for its overextended\nmilitary to quell. The empire fell after the conquest of Nineveh in 612 BCE.\nPage | 36 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\n2.7.4 The New Babylonian Empire (c. 626 \u2013 539 BCE)\nWith the weakening of the Assyrian Empire, the New Babylonian Empire began to dominate\nMesopotamia. Lasting for less than 100 years, the New Babylonian Empire is best known for\nits ruler, Nebuchadnezzar II, and its great architectural projects. As described in the Hebrew\nScriptures (also known as the Old Testament), Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled from 605 \u2013 562\nBCE, was a ruthless leader. He gained notoriety for destroying the city of Jerusalem and deporting\nmany of the city\u2019s Jews to Babylon. The captive Jews suffered in exile, as they were not allowed\nto return to their homeland. Nebuchadnezzar II also rebuilt Babylon with fortresses, temples,\nand enormous palaces. He associated the New Babylonian Empire with the glory of ancient\nBabylonia by reviving elements of Sumerian and Akkadian culture. For example, he had artists\nrestore ancient artwork and celebrated the kings of old, like Hammurabi. Nebuchadnezzar is often\nalso credited with rebuilding the city\u2019s ziggurat, Etemanaki, or the \u201cTemple of the Foundation of\nHeaven and Earth.\u201d When completed, the ziggurat rose several stories above the city and seemed\nto reach to the heavens. Some scholars claim that the Babylonian ziggurat was the famous Tower\nof Babel described in the Old Testament. Another one of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s purported projects,\nthe Hanging Gardens of Babylon, was considered by the later Greek historian Herodotus to be\none of the Seven Wonders of the World. According to legend, Nebuchadnezzar had the hanging\ngardens built for his wife. He made the desert bloom to remind her of her distant homeland;\nthe elaborate gardens planted on rooftops and terraces were designed so that the plants\u2019 leaves\nwould spill down high walls. Since definitive archaeological evidence of the Hanging Gardens\nof Babylon has not been found, scholars continue to debate its most likely location and even\nits very existence. After the death of Nebuchadnezzar II, outside military pressures as well as\ninternal conflict weakened the empire until the much larger Persian Empire conquered the New\nBabylonian Empire in 539 BCE.\n2.8 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MESOPOTAMIA FOR WORLD HISTORY\nMesopotamia saw the emergence of some of the first cities and the world\u2019s first empires. The\ncity-states of the region flourished from about 3000 to 2300 BCE. Then, Sargon of Akkad and\nsubsequent rulers built empires, expanding their control and influence over even larger territories.\nThere were cultural links and commonalities found in the Sumerian city-states of the third\nmillennium BCE. With agricultural production dependent on access to water, cities initially grew in\nSouthern Mesopotamia near rivers, namely the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and their tributaries.\nSumerians tried to control their environment using irrigation, drainage ditches, water reserves, and\nother methods. With unpredictable floods and other environmental challenges, the Sumerians viewed\nnature as hostile and their expectations of the afterlife tended to be pessimistic. Their understanding\nof nature as unpredictable also spurred engineering innovations as Sumerians prepared for floods,\nwater shortages, and other natural events. While farming was the mainstay of their economies,\ncity-states were also involved in robust long-distance trade networks, which allowed them to garner\nthe many resources not available in their region. These city-states alternately allied with, competed\nPage | 37 against, and waged war on one another, with kingship emerging as rulers dominated multiple city-\nstates. As evidenced by the centrality of temples and the belief that kingship came from heaven,\nreligion was of fundamental importance to these societies. Archaeologists have also uncovered ample\nevidence of social stratification and labor specialization in these ancient city-states. Archeologists\nhave been able to recognize Sumerian developments, in part, because the Sumerians left behind a\nwealth of information documented in cuneiform, one of the world\u2019s first written scripts. Scholars\nhave begun to describe life in ancient Sumerian societies and appreciate the many Sumerian\nachievements, like those in math, where they introduced a computation system based on 60 (which\nwe still use to divide time and in geometry as a circle has 360\u00b0). Overall, Sumerians were innovators,\nwith some of the first cities, one of the first systems of writing, notable achievements in engineering\nand architecture, the creation of larger political entities, and more.\nStarting with the Akkadian Empire, four empires controlled vast territories in Mesopotamia\nand the Fertile Crescent. Over a period of almost 1800 years, these empires brought together\ndiverse communities, often by military conquest and force. The empires facilitated trade, and\nspread ideas and culture. Their rulers developed administrative, military, and other techniques to\ntry to ensure compliance and recognition of their authority. As intended, the rulers and the cities\nthey built live on in legends, even though their empires eventually withered and fell.\n2.9 THE ISRAELITES AND ANCIENT ISRAEL\nThe Israelites, \u201cor children of Israel,\u201d were Semetic-speakers who lived in Canaan and traced\ntheir descent back to Abraham through his grandson Israel. Hebrew tradition begins their\nhistory with Abraham\u2019s departure from Ur in southern Mesopotamia (see Map 2.1). Therefore,\nAbraham is important in Jewish tradition, as he has been recognized as the first Jew, the\npatriarch from whom all Jews trace their descent, and a role model. As described in the Hebrew\nScriptures, known to Christians as the Old Testament, Abraham also made a covenant with God,\nwhich blessed his descendants. Jews, Christians, and Muslims of today all recognize Abraham\nas a significant figure, though these major monotheistic religions view him a little differently.\nRespect for Abraham by believers in all three of these religions is just one indication that the\nworld\u2019s three major monotheistic religions are connected. Examining these connections reveals\nthe extraordinary contributions that the Israelites made to World History. The Israelites were\nhighly influential in developing the idea of monotheism, or belief in one god. Furthermore,\nthey recorded their history orally at first, until their tradition was written down in the Hebrew\nScriptures (alternatively referred to as the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible, or the Old Testament of the\nChristian Bible). The Hebrew Scriptures has been one of the most important texts ever written.\nEventually, by the end of the second millennium BCE (likely between 1200 and 1000 BCE),\nthe Israelites established small kingdoms in the Levant. The Levant refers to areas adjacent to\nthe eastern Mediterranean; in the ancient world, it comprised roughly the area from southern\nAnatolia through coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean south and westward to the Egyptian\ndelta. The Israelite kingdoms were concentrated along the Mediterranean coast in what are today\nIsrael and the contested territory of the West Bank/Palestine.\nPage | 38 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nMuch debate exists amongst scholars about the sources used to reconstruct the history of the\nIsraelites with much of the debate revolving around the use and interpretation of religious texts,\nparticularly the Hebrew Scriptures. Right now, scholars rely fairly heavily on the Hebrew Scriptures\nto discuss periods before about 1200 BCE because other sources just do not exist. Some main points\nof contention have centered on dates, the purpose of religious texts, the reality that the Hebrew\nScriptures were written centuries after the events they described, and the relationship between the\nscriptures and historical fact. Additionally, there has been back and forth discussion about whether\narchaeological finds confirm or disprove the narrative in the religious texts. These heated debates have\nled some scholars to question whether it is even possible to write a history of the ancient Israelites.\nFor our purposes, this section will give an overview of Hebrew tradition and, using archaeological\nand collaborating evidence when possible, describe the development of the Israelite civilization.\n2.10 EARLY ISRAELITES\nBy leading people out of Ur, his homeland in Southern Mesopotamia, to eventually settle in\nCanaan, later called Palestine, Abraham began the traditional history of the Israelites. According\nto Hebrew tradition, even before leaving Ur, Abraham taught his followers about the existence of a\nsingle, creator god and rejected the idol-worship and sin of Ur. The narrative continues to explain\nhow when Abraham agreed to God\u2019s directive to leave his homeland, God blessed him and all of his\ndescendants. God entered into a covenant with Abraham, saying, \u201c\u2026And I will make you into a\ngreat nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great\u2026and by you all the families of the\nearth shall bless themselves.\u201d6 Jews recognize this covenant as indicating their special relationship\nwith God, and it remains one of the most important aspects of the Jewish faith.\nTradition recounts how several generations later Abraham\u2019s grandson, Israel (also called\nJacob), had twelve sons, who became the ancestors of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. One of these\ntwelve sons, Joseph, led followers from Canaan during a famine to settle in Egypt. As the biblical\ntext describes, the Israelites were prosperous at first and were becoming powerful, leading the\nEgyptian pharaoh to fear their influence. To try to stem the Israelite influence, the pharaoh put\nrestrictions on births and forced them into slave labor. Then, Moses, whose mother had secreted\nhim away in a waterproof basket on the Nile River, played an important role in delivering his\npeople from subjugation. According to Hebrew tradition, God tasked Moses with leading his\npeople out of Egypt, a flight to freedom called Exodus. Moses led \u201cthe children of Israel\u201d into\nSinai, where they entered into the Sinai Covenant. This covenant bound all Israelites into a pact\nwith God. Israelites agreed to worship God alone and obey his law, while God confirmed the\nplace of the Israelites as his \u201cChosen People,\u201d whom he would protect. As part of the covenant,\nIsraelites agreed to follow the Ten Commandments. According to Hebrew tradition, God gave\nthe Ten Commandments to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, instructing the Israelites to worship only\nhim, keep the Sabbath, and honor their parents. The Ten Commandments also prohibit idolatry,\nblasphemy, murder, adultery, theft, dishonesty, and coveting.\n6 As quoted in \u201cAbraham and the Covenant,\u201d Israel and Judaism Studies. http://www.ijs.org.au/Abraham-and-the-Cove-\nnant/default.aspx\nPage | 39 These written traditions established important elements of the Jewish faith. For example,\nthe Hebrew Scriptures trace Jewish descent from the Hebrew patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Israel\n(alternatively known as Jacob), and the twelve sons of Israel. They also describe the transition to\nmonotheism and the covenant relationship between God and \u201cthe children of Israel.\u201d Israelites\nbelieved in one god, Yahweh, who created and ruled over everything in the universe, and overall,\nthey perceived Yahweh as being just and merciful. The ideas that there is a single, universal god\nand that his laws apply to everyone have been defining tenets of other monotheistic religions.\nSubsequent written and oral traditions, like the Talmud, reflect further development of Jewish\nbeliefs, ethics, laws, and practice.\n2.11 THE UNITED KINGDOM OF ISRAEL\nAfter Exodus, the Israelites resettled in Canaan and in time began to unify. They formed\nkingdoms in the Levant just prior to 1000 BCE. King Saul (c. 1030 \u2013 1009 BCE), a member of\none of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, established the first Israelite monarchy, but ruled over a fairly\nlimited territory and died in battle with the Philistines. He was crowned king and began the\nprocess of unification, but did not completely defeat his enemies and finish unification before he\ndied. His son, King David, (d. 969 BCE), is often portrayed as Israel\u2019s greatest ruler or a model\nking. He established the United Kingdom of Israel, with its capital at Jerusalem. King David\u2019s\nsuccessor, his son Solomon, further shaped the kingdom.\nIn popular memory, King David is probably most remembered for defeating Goliath. Historical\ntraditions also celebrate him for expanding the borders of a newly unified Israel, contributing to\nthe Book of Psalms, and, in Christian tradition, for being a forbear of Jesus. David was a \u201cwarrior\nking,\u201d who defeated both internal and external enemies to unite Israel. He maintained a large\nstanding army that helped extend his influence and create neighboring tributary states. With\ncontrol of trade routes and tribute coming in from neighboring territories, Israel became a wealthy\nstate under David. With this wealth, David began to build Jerusalem into the capital city of the\nIsraelites, with further plans to build a temple to house the Ark of the Covenant (which according\nto Hebrew tradition held the Ten Commandments). David died before building this temple, but\ntradition credits him with other achievements, including composing many of the hymns and\nprayers in the Book of Psalms. Like Abraham, David is considered an important figure by Jews,\nChristians, and Muslims.\nKing Solomon, David\u2019s son, ruled a mostly peaceful realm. He accomplished his father\u2019s goal of\nbuilding the first Jewish temple in Jerusalem. The temple exemplified monumental architecture and\nbecame a focal point for the Jews of Jerusalem. Its ruins, known as the Western Wall or the Wailing\nWall, are still a site of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage. Solomon also directed the building of a royal\npalace, a defensive wall around the city of Jerusalem, and fortresses along the kingdom\u2019s frontier.\nAdministratively, Solomon set up twelve districts, overseen by purveyors, who collected tribute\nin kind (usually as crops or foodstuffs). Each of the twelve districts was charged with supplying\nthe king and the court for one month a year. Finally, Solomon used treaties and reciprocal trade\nagreements to maintain relatively peaceful relationships with Israel\u2019s neighbors. He also forged\nPage | 40 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\ndiplomatic relations through marriage;\naccording to scripture, he had 700 wives!\nAfter Solomon\u2019s death, what had been\nthe United Kingdom of Israel split into\ntwo pieces: Israel and Judah. Over the\nlong term, some of Solomon\u2019s policies,\nincluding forced labor and tributary\npayments, likely contributed to the divide.\nAfter the decline of the United Kingdom\nof Israel, Hebrew tradition describes\nthe significance of great prophets or\nteachers, who spoke on behalf of god\nand set moral and ethical standards\nfor the whole community. Yahweh sent\nthese prophets to warn the Israelites that\nthey were not abiding by their covenant.\nThe prophets during this later period,\nespecially Jeremiah and Second Isaiah,\ncultivated a new conceptualization of the\ncovenant, which was much more personal\nas it was a relationship between Yahweh\nand each individual.\nThe Assyrians and later the Greeks\nand then the Romans brought parts of\nthe former United Kingdom of Israel\nunder their rule. These conquests\nand persecution forced members of Map 2.5 | The United Kingdom of Israel | The map shows\nthe Jewish population into exile. This the unified state in blue, as well as the surrounding territories\nthat paid tribute to the United Kingdom of Israel.\nconceptualization of being members of\nAuthor: Regno di Davide\na diaspora, that is, a scattered people Source: Wikimedia Commons\nwho desire to return to their homeland, License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nhas played an important part in the\nformation of a Jewish identity. Also, in part, due to this history, preservation of cultural and\nreligious heritage has become an enduring objective of Jews.\n2.12 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISRAELITES AND ANCIENT ISRAEL\nThe Israelites left an extraordinary religious and ethical legacy. They were some of the first\nmonotheists, worshipping a single god, whom they referred to as Yahweh. Their religious texts\nfrom the ancient world, including the Hebrew Scriptures, served as the foundational texts of\nJudaism. The Hebrew Scriptures were also the basis of the Christian Old Testament, and Islam\nPage | 41 recognizes parts of the scriptures as divine revelations. There were other, widespread religious\ninfluences as well. For example, Christians and Muslims consider many of the figures, including\nAbraham, Moses, and David, and teachings, like the Ten Commandments, from the Hebrew\nScriptures to be very important. Furthermore, the Hebrew Scriptures contained the idea that\neveryone, regardless of status, was bound to obey the law.\nThe United Kingdom of Israel was a \u201cgolden age,\u201d associated with the creation of a unified,\nwealthy state with its new capital in Jerusalem. This civilization had well-developed religious\ntraditions, political power vested in a king, monumental architecture, and administrative\ninnovations. It also maintained a strong military, multiple tributary states, long-distance trade\nnetworks, and well-established diplomatic relationships with foreign states.\n2.13 ANCIENT EGYPT\nIn our study of World History, ancient Egypt serves as an excellent example of a complex\nsociety with cross-cultural connections, adaption to and control over changing environments,\nand sophisticated political and religious developments. All of these themes are evident in an\nexamination of the origins of Egypt. Egyptian leaders unified Upper and Lower Egypt around\n3100 BCE, creating a powerful ancient state. Developments in the millennia preceding unification,\nincluding the sharing of innovations and responses to environmental change, set the stage for the\nemergence of the Egyptian civilization.\nCross-cultural connections introduced the people of Northeast Africa to domesticated wheat\nand barley, two of the crops that they grew and whose surpluses supported the process of social\ndifferentiation and eventually the pharaonic, elite, and skilled classes of ancient Egypt. People in\nNortheast Africa had likely been gathering wild barley since before 10,000 BCE. However, sharing\nin the knowledge spreading from the Fertile Crescent around 7,000 BCE, they began cultivating\nwheat and barley and also keeping domesticated animals, including sheep and goats. At that time,\nagricultural production and herding were possible in areas that are today part of the Sahara Desert.\nThe period was much wetter than now. People in the region settled into small communities, and\narchaeological evidence of hearths, grinding stones, and storage silos show the growth of settlements\nin areas that today are not well watered enough for agricultural production. The presence of crocodile\nbones, along with similar pottery styles, also suggest a history of contact between communities\nemerging along the Nile River and these settlements farther west. However, environmental change\nwas leading to the desiccation or drying out of areas not adjacent to the Nile River, and by about\n5,000 BCE, it was no longer possible to farm much beyond the floodplain of the Nile River. Many\npeople adapted by moving towards the Nile River, and the Nile River became increasingly important\nto Egypt\u2019s populations.\nThe Nile River flows south to north, fed by two main river systems: the White Nile and\nthe Blue Nile. The White Nile flows steadily throughout the year and has its origins in the Great\nLakes Region of East Africa. The Blue Nile originates in the Ethiopian highlands, and brings\nfloodwaters up past the first cataract in the summers. (The first cataract lies roughly at Aswan on\nthe map in Map 2.6.) Cataracts are generally considered impassable by boat due to their shallows,\nPage | 42 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nrocks, and rapids. Comparatively, the flood plain of the Nile River is narrow, leading, especially\nwith the desiccation of the surrounding areas, to high population densities close to the river.\nThe winds also blow north to south, in the opposite direction of the river flow, thus facilitating\ntrade and contact between Upper Egypt (to the south) and Lower Egypt (to the north). Upper and\nLower Egypt lie north of the first cataract, usually allowing river traffic to proceed uninterrupted\nthroughout the territory. Egyptian views of the Nile generally recognized the river\u2019s centrality to\nlife as demonstrated in the \u201cHymn to the Nile,\u201d dated\nto approximately 2100 BCE. The praise-filled ode\nto the Nile River begins, \u201cHail to thee, O Nile! Who\nmanifests thyself over this land, and comes to give\nlife to Egypt.\u201d7 The course of the Nile River definitely\nimpacted settlement patterns, while the river also\nallowed for trade and the development of larger\nagricultural communities.\nAt the tail end of that era of desiccation, from\nabout 3600 to 3300 BCE, complex societies formed in\nareas adjacent to the Nile River. These communities\nexerted increased influence over their environments,\nexhibited social differentiation, and showed evidence\nof labor specialization. For example, people in the\nsettlements of Naganda and Hierakonpolis in Upper\nEgypt cleared trees and built dykes, canals, and\nearly irrigation systems. By about 3500 BCE, they\nused these methods to quadruple the amount of\ncleared, arable land and could support population\ndensities of up to one thousand people per square\nmile. Just as one example, recent archaeological finds\nat Hierakonpolis also show evidence of both social\ndifferential and specialization with separate burials\nfor the settlement\u2019s elite, the oldest known painted\ntomb, and the remnants of a large-scale brewery,\nMap 2.6 | The Path of the Nile | The White\ncapable of producing up to 300 gallons of beer a\nNile originates near Lake Victoria, in the\nGreat Lakes region of East Africa.

Once Egypt was unified, pharaohs ruled as\ndivine kings, as the personification of the gods. They promised order in the universe. When things\nwent well, the pharaohs were credited with agricultural productivity and the success of the state.\nThere was no separation between religion and the state in ancient Egypt.\nThe Palette of Narmer (see Figure 2.6 and Figure 2.7), which is used to date the unification\nof Egypt, shows signs that King Narmer legitimized his rule, in part, by claiming a special\nrelationship with the gods. King Narmer,\nwho is referred to in some text as Menes, is\ncommonly recognized as the first unifier of\nUpper (to the south) and Lower (to the north)\nEgypt in approximately 3100 BCE (see Map\n2.7).

For example, skilled artisans\nused hieroglyphs to chronicle glorified accounts of their patrons\u2019 lives on the sides of their tombs.\nThe Egyptians developed Hieratic and Demotic, the two other scripts, slightly later and used them\nfor administrative, commercial, and many other purposes. The Egyptian administration tended to\nuse ink and papyrus to maintain its official records. On the other hand, literate people used ostraca,\npieces of broken pottery and chips of limestone, for less formal notes and communications. Over\nthe past decades, archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of ostraca that start to tell us about\nthe lives of the literate elite and skilled craftsmen. Just like Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt had one of\nthe oldest written scripts found anywhere in the world.\nIn addition to one of the earliest writing systems and Egyptian paper (papyrus), archaeologists\nhave credited ancient Egyptians with a number of other innovations. For construction purposes,\nancient Egyptians invented the ramp and lever. They also developed a 12-month calendar with\n365 days, glassmaking skills, arithmetic (including one of the earliest decimal systems) and\ngeometry, and medical procedures to heal broken bones and relieve fevers. Finally, Egyptians\nused stone-carving techniques and other crafting skills and tools that were shared throughout\nthe Mediterranean.\n2.14 DYNASTIC EGYPT\nScholars break the 1500 years following unification, a time known as dynastic Egypt, into\nthree main periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 2660\u20132160 BCE), the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040 \u2013 1640\nBCE), and the New Kingdom (c. 1530\u20131070 BCE). There is some disagreement about the exact\ndates of the periods, but, in general, these spans denote more centralized control over a unified\nEgypt. During dynastic Egypt, pharaohs ruled a united Upper and Lower Egypt. In between these\nperiods of centralized control were intermediate periods, during which the Egyptian pharaohs\nhad less authority. The intermediate periods were characterized by political upheaval and military\nviolence, the latter often at least partially resulting from foreign invasions.\nStriking continuities existed in Egypt throughout the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom,\nand the New Kingdom. Egypt had stable population numbers, consistent social stratification,\npharaohs\u2014who exercised significant power\u2014and a unifying religious ideology, which linked the\npharaohs to the gods. As Egypt transitioned from the period of unification under King Narmer\nto the Old Kingdom, the pharaohs and the elite became increasingly wealthy and powerful. They\nfurther developed earlier systems of tax collection, expanded the religious doctrine, and built a\nhuge state bureaucracy.\nSocial distinctions and hierarchies remained fairly consistent through all of dynastic Egypt.\nMost people were rural peasant farmers. They lived in small mud huts just above the flood plain\nand turned over surplus agricultural produce to the state as taxes. When they weren\u2019t farming, they\nwere expected to perform rotating service for the state, by, for example, working on a pharaoh\u2019s\ntomb, reinforcing dykes, and helping in the construction of temples. The labor of the majority of\nthe population supported the more elite and skilled classes, from the pharaoh down through the\ngoverning bureaucrats, priests, nobles, soldiers, and skilled craftspeople, especially those who\nPage | 45 worked on pyramids and tombs. (Visit\nthe following link for a diagram of the\nEgyptian social hierarchy: http://dgh.\nwikispaces.com/file/view/wh06fs_\nc04000006a.jpg/76595189/385x235/\nwh06fs_c04000006a.jpg.)\nAnother continuity in dynastic\nEgypt was the relative equality of\nwomen to men. At least compared\nto women in other ancient societies,\nwomen in ancient Egypt had\nconsiderable legal rights and freedoms.\nMen and women did generally have\ndifferent roles; Egyptian society\ncharged men with providing for the\nfamily and women with managing the\nhome and children. Society\u2019s ascribed\ngender roles meant that women were\nusually defined primarily by their\nhusbands and children, while men\nwere defined by their occupations. This\ndifference could leave women more\neconomically vulnerable than men. For\nexample, in the village of craftspeople\nwho worked on the pharaoh\u2019s tomb at\nDeir el Medina, houses were allocated\nto the men who were actively employed.\nThis system of assigning housing\nmeant that women whose husbands\nhad died would be kicked out of their\nhomes as replacement workers were\nbrought in. Despite some vulnerability,\nEgyptian law was pretty equal between\nthe sexes when it came to many other\nissues. Egyptian women could own\nproperty, and tax records show that\nMap 2.7 | Upper and Lower Egypt | Note the narrowness of\nthey did. Egyptian women could also\nthe floodplain, marked in green.

One last, perhaps\nsurprising, legal entitlement of ancient\nEgyptian women was their right to\none-third of the property that a couple\naccumulated over the course of their\nmarriage. Married women had some\nfinancial independence, which gave\nthem options to dispose of their own\nproperty or divorce. Therefore, while\nwomen did face constraints in terms\nof their expected roles and had their\nstatus tied to the men in their families,\nthey nevertheless enjoyed economic\nfreedoms and legal rights not commonly\nseen in the ancient world.\nFigure 2.8 | Female figurines from ancient Egypt | These\nWhile scholars working over the figurines show some of the everyday tasks carried out by\npast several decades have used artwork, women.

Part of the disagreement stems from how various scholars\ndefine slavery. There is also great uncertainty about the number of slaves within the Egyptian\npopulation. The emerging consensus suggests that Egyptians increasingly used slaves from the\nMiddle Kingdom onward. The majority of the slaves in these later dynasties were either prisoners\nof war or slaves brought from Asia. Slaves performed many tasks. For example, they labored in\nagricultural fields, served in the army, worked in construction, helped their merchant owners in\nshops, and were domestic servants for the Egyptian elite. Slaves were branded and, if possible,\nwould be captured and returned to their masters if they tried to escape. Some masters undoubtedly\nabused their slaves, though the image of thousands of slaves sacrificed to be buried with pharaohs\nincorrectly depicts dynastic Egypt. Manumission (freeing a slave) was seemingly not very common,\nbut if they were freed, former slaves were not stigmatized; instead, they were considered part of\nthe general free population. These new scholarly conclusions about the relatively small numbers\nof slaves in Egypt, especially during the Old Kingdom, have impacted our understanding of how\npyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed during dynastic Egypt.\nThe Old Kingdom saw pharaohs harness their influence to build pyramids to emphasize\ntheir relationship to the divine and facilitate their ascent to the gods after their earthly deaths.\nPyramids, with their distinctive shape, which you can see in Figure 2.9, contained tombs for the\npharaohs and their wives. They were marvels of engineering, built on a massive scale to honor the\npharaohs and usher them into the afterlife. Pharaohs were mummified to preserve their bodies and\nPage | 47 were buried with everything considered necessary for the afterlife, including furniture, jewelry,\nmakeup, pottery, food, wine, clothing, and sometimes even pets. The most recognizable pyramids\nfrom the Old Kingdom are the three pyramids at the Giza complex, which were built for a father\n(Egyptian pharaoh Khufu), and his son and grandson, who all ruled during the fourth dynasty.\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu, is the largest of the three pyramids.\nStill largely intact today, it was the largest building in the world until the twentieth century.\nOver 500 feet high, it covered an area of 200 square yards, and was built with over 600 tons of\nlimestone. Recent studies on the construction of the pyramids have put much more emphasis on\nthe roles of skilled craftsmen\u2014who might work at multiple pyramid sites over the course of their\nlifetimes\u2014and rotating groups of unskilled workers than on slaves. These studies suggest that\nskilled craftsmen and local labor forces of Egyptians were the primary builders of the pyramids,\nincluding the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Great Pyramid of Giza took an estimated 20 years to\nconstruct and employed skilled stonemasons, architects, artists, and craftsmen, in addition to the\nthousands of unskilled laborers who did the heavy moving and lifting. The construction of the\nGreat Pyramid of Giza was an enormous, expensive feat. The pyramid stands as testimony to the\nFigure 2.9 | The Great Pyramid at Giza\nAuthor: User \u201cJeancaffou\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 48 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nincreased social differentiation, the great power and wealth of the Egyptian pharaohs, and the\nsignificance of beliefs in the afterlife during the Old Kingdom.\nIn addition to the construction of pyramids, the Old Kingdom saw increased trade and\nremained a relatively peaceful period. The pharaoh\u2019s government controlled trade, with Egypt\nexporting grain and gold (the latter from Nubia to the south) and importing timber, spices, ivory,\nand other luxury goods. During the Old Kingdom, Egypt did not have a standing army and faced\nfew foreign military threats. Lasting almost 400 years, the Old Kingdom saw the extension of the\npharaoh\u2019s power, especially through the government\u2019s ability to harness labor and control trade.\nHowever, the power of the pharaohs began to wane in the fifth dynasty of the Old Kingdom.\nContinuing environmental change that led to droughts and famine, coupled with the huge expense\nof building pyramids likely impoverished pharaohs in the last centuries of the Old Kingdom.\nAdditionally, the governors known as nomes, who administered Egypt\u2019s 42 provinces from the fifth\ndynasty onward, became more independent and took over functions that had been overseen by the\nstate. As an added blow, the pharaohs lost control of trade. While dynastic leaders still referred to\nthemselves as pharaohs, they lacked central authority over a unified Egypt by 2180 BCE.\nFollowing the decentralized First Intermediate Period of roughly 150 years, Pharaoh\nMentohotep II reunified Egypt to found the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom saw the\nreorganization of the state\u2019s bureaucratic apparatus to control the nomes. To further strengthen\ntheir authority, the pharaohs also moved their capital from the Old Kingdom capital of Thebes\nsouth to Lisht, halfway between Upper and Lower Egypt. With military expeditions, they extended\nthe boundaries of the state north to Lebanon and south to the second cataract of the Nile into a\nregion known as Nubia. With this extension of territory, Egypt had access to more trade goods, and\nthe organization of trade shifted so that professional merchants took a leading role in developing\nnew trade routes. These professional merchants paid taxes to the state, supporting further\nconsolidation of power by the pharaohs and also infrastructural improvements like irrigation.\nDuring the Middle Kingdom, the pharaohs focused less on the building of massive pyramids and\nmore on administrative reorganization, military expeditions, and the state\u2019s infrastructural repair.\nDisputes over succession and ineffectual rulers led into the Second Intermediate Period. Most\nnotably, Egypt was invaded from both the north and the south during this period. The Hyksos\ninvaded from the north in 1670 BCE. They brought bronze and horse-drawn chariots, which\nallowed them to conquer parts of Lower Egypt and establish their own kingdom, one lasting about\n100 years in the Nile Delta region. From the south, the Kingdom of Kush, based in Nubia, invaded\nand temporarily established control over Upper Egypt to Aswan. Thus, foreign rulers dominated\nmuch of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period.\nThe New Kingdom of reunified Egypt that began in 1530 BCE saw an era of Egyptian\nimperialism, changes in the burial practices of pharaohs, and the emergence of a brief period\nof state-sponsored monotheism under the Pharaoh Akhenaten. In 1530 BCE, the pharaoh who\nbecame known as Ahmose the Liberator (Ahmose I) defeated the Hyksos and continued sweeping\nup along the Eastern Mediterranean. By 1500 BCE, the Egyptian army had also pushed into Nubia,\ntaking Kush southward to the fourth cataract of the Nile River (see Map 2.8). As pharaohs following\nAhmose I continued Egypt\u2019s expansion, the Imperial Egyptian army ran successful campaigns in\nPage | 49 Palestine and Syria, along the Eastern\nMediterranean. Furthermore, by\nexpanding into Kush, Egypt controlled\ntrade routes into Sub-Saharan Africa.\nAdopting the Hyksos\u2019 chariot military\nand metal technologies contributed\nto the Egyptian ability to strengthen\nits military. Egypt maintained a large\nstanding army and built an expansive\nempire during the New Kingdom.\nEgypt saw many other developments\nduring the New Kingdom, especially\nwhen it came to burial practices and\nreligion. During the New Kingdom,\npharaohs and Egyptian elites used\nthe Valley of Kings, located across\nthe Nile River from Thebes, as their\npreferred burial site. They desired\ntombs that were hidden away and safe\nfrom tomb robbers. Therefore, instead\nof pyramids, they favored huge stone\ntombs built into the mountains of Map 2.8 | Egypt during its Imperialistic New Kingdom,\nc. 1400 BCE\nthe Valley of the Kings. Nearly all of\nAuthor: Jeff Dahl\nthe tombs in the Valley of Kings were Source: Wikimedia Commons\nraided, so the fears of the pharaohs License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nwere well founded. Tomb raiding\nwas even common during dynastic Egypt. King Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb has become one familiar\nexception. His tomb fared unusually well over the millennia, and King Tutankhamen\u2019s image is\nwell known to us because his tomb was found mostly intact in 1922.\nThroughout dynastic Egypt, much continuity existed in religious beliefs, causing scholars to\ncharacterize Egyptian society as conservative, meaning that Egyptians shied away from change.\nIn general, Egyptian religious beliefs emphasized unity and harmony. Throughout the dynastic\nperiod, Egyptians thought that the soul contained distinct parts. They believed that one part, the\nka, was a person\u2019s lifeforce and that it separated from the body after death. The Egyptians carried\nout their elaborate preservation of mummies and made small tomb statues to house their ka after\ndeath. The ba, another part of the soul, was the unique character of the individual, which could move\nbetween the worlds of the living and the dead. They believed that after death, if rituals were carried\nout correctly, their ka and ba would reunite to reanimate their akh, or spirit. If they observed the\nproper rituals and successfully passed through Final Judgment (where they recited the 42 \u201cNegative\nConfessions\u201d and the god Osiris weighed their hearts against a feather), Egyptians believed that\ntheir resurrected spirit, their akh, would enter the afterlife. In contrast to Mesopotamian society,\nPage | 50 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nEgyptians conceptualized the afterlife as\npleasant. In the afterlife, they expected\nto find a place with blue skies, agreeable\nweather, and familiar objects and people.\nThey also expected to complete many\nof the everyday tasks, such as farming,\nand enjoy many of the same recognizable\npastimes. Throughout the centuries, the\nEgyptians conceptualized the afterlife as a\ncomfortable mirror image of life.\nOne change that occurred over time\nwas the \u201cdemocratization of the afterlife.\u201d\nAs time progressed through the Middle\nKingdom and into the New Kingdom, more Figure 2.10 | Tombs at the Valley of the Kings\nAuthor: User \u201cKarmosin\u201d\nand more people aspired to an afterlife. No\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nlonger was an afterlife seen as possible for License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nonly the pharaoh and the elite of society. Instead,\njust about all sectors of society expected access, as\nevident in the increased use of funeral texts, like\nthe Book of the Dead. People of varying means\nwould slip papyrus with spells or prayers from the\nBook of the Dead (or a similar text) into coffins\nand burial chambers. They intended these spells\nto help their deceased loved ones make it safely\nthrough the underworld into the pleasant afterlife.\nConceptualizations of the afterlife consistently\nemphasized its familiarity and beauty, while more\npeople looked forward to this continued existence\nafter their earthly deaths.\nAs they developed religious doctrine and came\ninto contact with new deities, Egyptians integrated\nnew gods and goddesses into their religious beliefs.\nLike ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians were\npolytheistic. Some of the roles and back-stories of\nFigure 2.11 | Golden Mask of Tutankhamun | the deities did change over time; nevertheless, over\nBecause his tomb was found mostly intact in 1922, the millennia they remained quite consistent.

Re was the\nLicense: CC BY 2.0\nPage | 51 sun god, Osiris was the god of the afterworld, who also controlled nature\u2019s cycles (like the all\nimportant flooding of the Nile), Horus became a god of war and protection, and Isis was a goddess\nassociated with healing and motherhood. During the Middle Kingdom, Amun, initially a patron\nsaint of the city of Thebes and later recognized as the father of the pharaoh, was combined with Re,\nthe sun god, to become Amun-Re the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon. Amun-Re retained\nthis place at the top of the Egyptian pantheon through most of the New Kingdom. One major\nexception occurred during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.\nPharaoh Akhenaten started what is known as the Amarna Period. The Amarna Period, which\nlasted from approximately 1350 to 1325 BCE, stands out for its state-sponsored monotheism.\nAkhenaten introduced radical changes to Egyptian society, moving the capital to Tell el Amarna,\na new settlement in the middle of the desert that was devoted to the worship of Aten and the\nrecognition of the pharaoh\u2019s superiority over everyone else. Aten, who had been one of many\ndeities worshipped during the Middle Kingdom, was elevated to the creator god associated with\nsunlight, the foundation of all life. The \u201cGreat Hymn to Aten\u201d explains the god Aten\u2019s association\nwith the sun as, like the sun, his \u201crays embraced the lands\u201d of Egypt.8 Akhenaten had the Great\nTemple of Aten built in the middle of the new capital, and, unlike previous temples, this one\nhad no roof and was open to sunlight. Akhenaten further modified Egyptian religious doctrine to\nidentify himself as the son of Aten. According to the new religious ideology, Akhenaten alone was\nable to ensure access to the afterlife and communicate with Aten, the sole god. To reinforce Aten\u2019s\nsingularity, Akhenaten withdrew financial support from temples dedicated to other deities and\ndefaced the temples dedicated to Amun, who had previously been the most dominant Egyptian\ndeity. The prominence of Aten and Akhenaten\u2019s exclusive access to him define the Amarna Period.\nWhy did Akhenaten introduce these radical changes? At least in part, Akhenaten wanted\nto break with the priests in Thebes who controlled the temples dedicated to Amun because he\nbelieved that these priests had become too powerful. Additionally, by taking on the role of the\nson of Aten and regulating entry into the afterlife, Akhenaten certainly attempted to reformulate\nbeliefs to emphasize his own importance.\nAkhenaten\u2019s radical changes were likely troubling for most of the Egyptian population. They had\npreviously found comfort in their access to deities and their regular religious rituals. The worship\nof Aten as the only Egyptian god did not last more than a couple of decades, floundering after the\ndeath of Akhenaten. Pharaohs who ruled from 1323 BCE onward tried not only to erase the religious\nlegacies of the Amarna Period, but also to destroy the capital at Tell el Amarna and remove Akhenaten\nfrom the historical record. Archaeologists have not found Akhenaten\u2019s tomb or burial place. Scholars\ncontinue a long-standing debate about how this brief period of Egyptian monotheism relates (if at\nall) to the monotheism of the Israelites. Despite such uncertainties, study of the Amarna period\ndoes indicate that Egyptians in the fourteenth century BCE saw the fleeting appearance of religious\nideology that identified Aten as the singular god.\nSome of the strongest rulers of the New Kingdom, including Ramses I and Ramses II, came to\npower after the Amarna Period. These pharaohs expanded Egypt\u2019s centralized administration and its\n8 \u201cThe Great Hymn to Aten.\u201d http://web.archive.org/web/19990221040703/http://puffin.creighton.edu/theo/simkins/tx/\nAten.html\nPage | 52 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\ncontrol over foreign territories. However,\nby the twelfth century BCE, weaker rulers,\nforeign invasions, and the loss of territory\nin Nubia and Palestine indicated the\nimminent collapse of the New Kingdom.\nIn the Late Period that followed (c. 1040\nto 332 BCE), the Kingdom of Kush, based\nin Nubia, invaded and briefly ruled Egypt\nuntil the Assyrians conquered Thebes,\nestablishing their own rule over Lower\nEgypt. Egyptian internal revolts and\nthe conquest by Nubia and the Assyrian\nEmpire left Egypt susceptible to invasion\nby the Persians and then eventually the\n332 BCE invasion of Alexander the Great.\nThe ancient Egyptians made numerous\ncontributions to World History. We\nremember them for mummification, their\npharaohs, and the pyramids. Certainly,\nin this era, Egypt stands out for its\nability to produce agricultural surpluses\nthat supported the elites, priests, and\nFigure 2.11 | Panel with adoration Scene of Aten |\nskilled craftspeople.

Additionally, the innovations\nof Egyptians, such as their stone-carving techniques, hieroglyphics, the use of papyrus, their\nknowledge of the length of a solar year, and their construction methods, influenced the ancient\nworld and still inspire awe. Overall, the ancient Egyptians created a vibrant civilization, while they\nalso found comfort in the familiar and traditional.\n2.15 NUBIA: THE KINGDOMS OF KERMA AND KUSH\nThe region south of Aswan, at the first cataract of the Nile River, is commonly called Nubia.\nNubia is notable for its long-term, dynamic relationship with ancient Egypt. Just as importantly,\nNubia was also the site of an early civilization. The kingdoms of Kerma (c. 2400 BCE to 1500 BCE)\nand Kush (c. 1000 BCE to 300 CE) emerged along the Nile River. These kingdoms prospered\nespecially due to their productive agriculture and the region\u2019s copious natural resources. At\ncertain points, both Kerma and Kush were strong enough to successfully invade Egypt. These\nPage | 53 kingdoms in Nubia also developed their own religious and cultural traditions, including a written\nscript, Meroitic. While the people of this region, known collectively as Nubians, borrowed heavily\nfrom the Egyptians, Nubians also had distinctive practices that set their civilization apart from\nthat of their northern neighbors.\nScholars generally link the origins of ancient Kerma (in present-day Sudan) back to the\ndesiccation of the Sahara Desert and the rise of dynastic Egypt. Similarly to ancient Egypt, the\ndrying out of the region encouraged people\nto move closer to the Nile River in the\nyears between 5,000 and 4,000 BCE. Rock\npaintings, showing cattle in areas that have\nbeen desert for thousands of years, attest\nto the environmental changes in Nubia and\nalso the development of a cattle culture that\ndates back to at least the fourth millennium\nBCE. Just as in Egypt, the desiccation of the\nSahara desert drew together people from\nall directions. As people settled closer to\nthe Nile River in Nubia, they brought their\ncattle, their agricultural traditions, and their\nlanguages, building settlements with higher\npopulation densities.\nAdditionally, Egyptian elites desired ivory,\nanimal skins, incense, and other luxury goods\nprompting trade between Nubia and Egypt\nthat pre-dated the unification of Egypt. With\nincreased demand for luxury goods as social\nstratification grew, the Egyptians even ran\nMap 2.9 | A map of ancient Nubia\nmilitary forays into Nubia. After unification,\nAuthor: Mark Dingemanse and Corey Parson\nSource: Wikimedia Commons the Egyptians continued to invade Nubia to\nLicense: CC BY 2.5 trade and raid for slaves and cattle. Likely,\nNubian desires to control trade and protect\nthemselves from Egyptian raids further compelled state formation in Nubia. Without Nubian\nrecords from the third millennium BCE, it is difficult to identify additional reasons why the state\narose. However, archeological evidence does clearly indicate that by about 2400 BCE, Nubians had\nformed the Kingdom of Kerma between the third and fourth cataracts of the Nile River.\n2.15.1 Kerma (c. 2400 BCE to c. 1500 BCE)\nKerma endured in Upper Nubia for almost a thousand years. The kingdom is named after\nits capital city at Kerma at the third cataract, but excavations at other sites (where similar\npottery styles and burial sites have been found) suggest that at its height Kerma\u2019s reach may\nPage | 54 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nhave extended more than 200 miles southward past the fifth cataract of the Nile River. So far,\narchaeological evidence indicates that, with the exception of the capital and perhaps one or two\nother cities, most of the people in Kerma lived in smaller villages. They grew crops like barley,\nand kept goats, sheep, and cattle, sending tribute to their capital. The people of Kerma also\ndeveloped industries, especially in mining, metalworking, and pottery. Kerma was linked inter-\nregionally through trade to its tributary villages, to dynastic Egypt, and to sub-Saharan Africa.\nEgyptian pharaohs and elites wanted the gold, copper, slaves, ivory, exotic animals, and more\nthat they obtained from Kerma.\nThe people of Kerma also made use of their location on the Nile and proximity to Egypt as they\nimported textiles, jewelry, and other manufactured goods. Presumably, one reason that Nubian\nleaders built their ancient capital at Kerma was to oversee river trade. At the impassable cataract,\nboat owners unloaded their cargo and took it overland past the shallows and rocks before again\nproceeding on the water. This location at the cataract gave the leaders at Kerma the chance to tax,\ndivert, and register goods being transported between Kerma and Egypt.\nAgricultural surpluses and other tributary payments supported the rulers and elites of the\ncapital. Archaeologists have shown that the capital had defenses, including ditches, ramparts, and\nmassive walls with towers. There were also palaces within the city and on its outskirts. However,\nthe most famous structure is the Western Deffufa (Figure 2.13) made of mud-bricks, which likely\nserved as a temple. Two other deffufa, large mud-brick structures with spaces for rituals on top,\nhave been at least partially excavated within the vicinity of Kerma. Another notable archaeological\nfind is the Eastern Cemetery, which lies a couple of miles to the east of the city. It served as the\nburial site for Kerma\u2019s rulers for almost a thousand years and contains over 30,000 tombs. Some\nof the tombs were covered with\nlarge mounds. Demonstrating\nthe cattle culture of the region,\ndozens of cattle skulls encircle\na number of the tombs. Tombs\nalso contain the remains of\nhuman sacrifices and other\nsymbols of wealth and status,\nlike jewelry made of gold\nand silver. The largest tomb\nfound to date is 300 feet in\ndiameter and covered with\nblack granite, white quartz\npebbles, and a marble top. Its\ninterior burial suite contains\nsemi-precious stones, bronze\nFigure 2.13 | The Western Deffufa at Kerma\nweapons, and lavish furniture.\nAuthor: Walter Callens\nIn the corridor leading into Source: Wikimedia Commons\nthe underground burial site, License: CC BY 2.0\nPage | 55 archaeologists unearthed the remains of horses, dogs, and about 400 human sacrificial victims.\nThe cattle skulls, mounds, and the remains of human sacrifices have led scholars to suggest that\nthe Kerma elite had their own styles for monumental structures like the Western Deffufa and their\ntombs, even though they sometimes employed Egyptian artisans to complete the construction of\nthese grand projects.\nIt appears that Kerma was strongest when neighboring Egypt was weak. As a case in point,\nduring Egypt\u2019s Second Intermediate Period, Kerma, at the height of its power, successfully\ninvaded parts of Upper Egypt and established diplomatic relations with the occupying Hyksos.\nOnce reunified during the New Kingdom, Egypt retaliated by conquering Kerma to the fourth\ncataract. Then, Egypt occupied Kerma for the next 500 years. During the Egyptian occupation, the\nelite classes of Kerma adopted many elements of Egyptian culture, including Egyptian gods, styles\nof dress, Hieroglyphics, and the Egyptian language. However, scholars believe that the Nubian\nmasses retained their own distinctive identity with their local language and customs.\n2.15.2 The Kingdom of Kush\nAs Egypt entered its Third Intermediate Period, Nubians gradually established their\nindependence, eventually creating a new state, the Kingdom of Kush in the eighth century BCE.\nThe initial capital of the Kingdom of Kush was Napata (c. 750 BCE to 593 BCE). From Napata,\nthe Nubians took control of Upper Egypt, establishing the \u201cEthiopian Dynasty,\u201d which ruled for\n60 years from Thebes. Assyrian invasions destabilized the Nubian rulers in Thebes, causing the\nlast pharaoh of the Ethiopian Dynasty to flee to Napata. Then, once strengthened, the Egyptians\npushed back. The Egyptian army sacked Napata in 593 BCE and, in response, the Nubian rulers\nmoved their capital farther south to Meroe. (See Map 2.9.) At this southern location, they further\ndeveloped their civilization, which lasted until the fourth century CE.\nWith the new capital at Meroe, a location with well-watered farmland and some distance\nbetween it and Egypt, the Kingdom of Kush flourished. Meroe got more rainfall than Napata and\nwas not as dependent on the Nile floods. Nubians were able to extend the areas under cultivation\nand grow a wider variety of crops, like cotton, sorghum, and millet. They were also able to easily\ngraze their livestock and, as a result, during this period cattle became even more important as a\nsymbol of their culture and wealth.\nAfter moving the capital to Meroe, the culture of Kush showed more independence from\nEgypt as well. Particularly as Egypt\u2019s power declined, the people of Kush put more emphasis on\ntheir own deities and pushed Egyptian gods to the background. For example, temples devoted\nto a Nubian war god, Apedamak, \u201cthe Lion of the South,\u201d received more support and even used\nlive lions for rituals. Gold had long been mined in the region and remained important while the\npeople of Kush continued to develop additional industries. The area was rich in iron ore and the\nhardwoods used to make charcoal, which encouraged the growth of a booming iron industry.\nThey made iron weapons and tools that they used for defense and to increase their crop yields.\nThey were able to trade their agricultural surpluses, iron, cattle, and exotic things like elephants\nfrom sub-Saharan Africa, with Egypt, Greece, Rome, and India, bringing great wealth and\nPage | 56 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nprestige to Meroe. Also, the rulers\nof Meroe commissioned pyramids\nbut had them built in a local\nstyle. As evident in Figure 2.14,\ntheir pyramids were smaller and\nhad a unique shape. Kush burial\npractices were different than those\nused in dynastic Egypt, as corpses\nwere not always mummified and\nwere buried in the fetal position.\nFinally, a new locally-created\nwritten script, Meroitic, replaced\nthe use of Egyptian Hieroglyphics\nby 300 BCE. Modern scholars\nFigure 2.14 | Pyramids at Meroe\nAuthor: B. N. Chagny have not yet translated Meroitic,\nSource: Wikimedia Commons and students of their culture will\nLicense: CC BY-SA 1.0\nsurely learn even more about the\nKingdom of Kush once scholars\nhave done so. As for now, we know that very productive agriculture, local rituals and burial\npractices, the growth of industries, social stratification facilitated by Meroe\u2019s wealth and\nextensive trade networks, and the written script Meroitic, were some of the distinctive elements\nof the civilization at Kush.\nWhile the Greeks and Romans occasionally sent raiding parties into Nubia, for a while, Meroe\u2019s\nsouthern location helped isolate it from conquest. Legends also emphasize the strength of Meroe\u2019s\narmy and the physical prowess of its soldiers. Environmental changes, internal rivalries, and the\nrise of Axum (a new state to the East) likely all contributed to the fairly abrupt collapse of Meroe\nin the fourth century CE.\nEgyptian sources were generally very derogatory in their portrayal of Nubians and even a\nfew early twentieth century archaeologists carelessly (and incorrectly) identified these Nubian\nkingdoms as slave colonies of the Egyptians. However, the kingdoms of Kerma and Kush were\nknown in the ancient world for their wealth and industries. The wealth garnered through productive\nagriculture and trade supported a ruling class, great artists, and monumental architecture.\nEgyptian culture was influential, but Nubians adapted Egyptian practices to meet their own needs\nand sensibilities. Often entangled with Egypt and sometimes defending themselves from other\ninvaders as well, these two kingdoms persisted for hundreds of years, creating an independent\ncivilization along the southern stretches of the Nile River.\n2.16 SUMMARY\nBetween about 4000 and 3000 BCE, civilizations emerged in the fertile river valleys of\nMesopotamia and Northeast Africa. These civilizations had common elements, including\nPage | 57 food surpluses, higher population densities, social stratification, systems of taxation, labor\nspecialization, regular trade, and written scripts.\nIn areas adjacent to the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Mesopotamians built city-states by 3500\nBCE. While Sumerian traditions influenced developments throughout the region, other cities\nemerged and refined their own institutions and beliefs. Archaeological finds and records in the\ncuneiform script show the significance of the temple complex and religious leaders throughout\nMesopotamia. Kingship, with hereditary rulers who claimed control over multiple city-states and\nspecial relationships with the gods, was just one significant political innovation in the region.\nHistory credits Sargon of Akkad with founding the first empire in Mesopotamia. Thereafter, a\nsuccession of empires rose and fell, demonstrating the dynamic nature of Mesopotamian societies.\nAccording to Hebrew Tradition, Abraham led his followers from the city of Ur in Mesopotamia\nand they eventually settled in the Levant. Several generations later, according to Hebrew Tradition,\nthe Israelites went to Egypt where they suffered persecution and enslavement, until Moses liberated\nthem. Upon their return to Canaan, the Israelites built kingdoms just prior to 1000 BCE. Their\nkingdoms formed complex administrations and were unified by powerful kings, such as the well-\nknown King Solomon. Historians also recognize countless other contributions made by the Israelites,\nespecially as regards monotheistic religious traditions and western understandings of justice.\nThe unification of Egypt in approximately 3100 BCE evidenced the emergence of one civilization\nin Northeast Africa. In Nubia to the south of Egypt, Africans built another civilization with the\nkingdoms of Kerma and Kush. The people in each of these civilizations made good use of the\nagriculturally productive floodplains of the Nile River. Egypt and the kingdoms in Nubia influenced\none another; they traded and intermittently claimed control over each other\u2019s territory. While we may\nbe more familiar with the pharaohs, pyramids, and religious beliefs of ancient Egypt, Nubians made\ntheir own contributions, like the Merotic script and unique architectural styles, to World History.\n2.17 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nCivilizations\nBrown, Cynthia Stokes. \u201cWhat is a Civilization, Anyway?\u201d World History Connected (October 2009) http://\nworldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/6.3/brown.html\nBellows, Sierra. \u201cThe Trouble with Civilization,\u201d UVA Magazine (Fall 2010) http://uvamagazine.org/\narticles/the_trouble_with_civilization/\nMesopotamia\nBelibtreu, Erika. \u201cGrisly Assyrian Record of Torture and Death.\u201d http://faculty.uml.edu/ethan_Spanier/\nTeaching/documents/CP6.0AssyrianTorture.pdf\nHistory Department, University College London. \u201cAssyrian Empire Builders.\u201d http://www.ucl.ac.uk/\nsargon/\nInternational World History Project. \u201cThe Akkadians.\u201d http://history-world.org/sargon_the_great.htm\nPage | 58 CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS\nKhan Academy. \u201cZiggurat of Ur.\u201d https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/\nancient-near-east1/sumerian/a/ziggurat-of-ur\nKilmer, Anne. \u201cThe Musical Instruments from Ur and Ancient Mesopotamian Music.\u201d Expedition.

Prior to the twentieth century, for instance, historians\nbelieved that India\u2019s history began in the second millennium BCE, when a people known as In-\ndo-Aryans migrated into the Indian subcontinent and created a new civilization. Yet, even during\nthe nineteenth century British explorers and officials were curious about brick mounds dotting the\nlandscape of northwest India, where Pakistan is today. A large one was located in a village named\nHarappa (see Figure 3.1). A British army engineer, Sir Alexander Cunningham, sensed its impor-\ntance because he also found other artifacts among the bricks, such as a seal with an inscription.\nHe was, therefore, quite dismayed that railway contractors were pilfering these bricks for ballast.\nWhen he became the director of Great Britain\u2019s Archaeological Survey in 1872, he ordered protec-\ntion for these ruins. But the excavation of Harappa did not begin until 1920, and neither the Ar-\nchaeological Survey nor Indian archaeologists understood their significance until this time. Harap-\nPage | 62 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\npa, it turned out, was an an-\ncient city dating back to the\nthird millennium BCE, and\nonly one part of a much larg-\ner civilization sprawling over\nnorthwest India. With the\ndiscovery of this lost civiliza-\ntion, the timeline for India\u2019s\nhistory was pushed back\nover one thousand years.\nThe Indus Valley civili-\nzation (2600 \u2013 1700 BCE)\nnow stands at the beginning\nof India\u2019s long history. Much\nlike the states of ancient\nMesopotamia and Egypt, the\nFigure 3.1 | Archaeological Site for Harappa | Excavation of this ancient foundations for that history\ncity began in 1920. were established by Paleo-\nAuthor: Hassan Nasir\nlithic foragers who migrated\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 to and populated the region,\nand then Neolithic agricul-\nturalists who settled into villages. During the third millennium BCE, building on these founda-\ntions, urban centers emerged along the Indus River, along with other elements that contribute to\nmaking a civilization.\nThis civilization, however, faded away by 1700 BCE, and was followed by a new stage in India\u2019s\nhistory. While it declined, India saw waves of migration from the mountainous northwest, by a\npeople who referred to themselves as Aryans. The Aryans brought a distinctive language and way\nof life to the northern half of India and, after first migrating into the Punjab and Indus Valley,\npushed east along the Ganges River and settled down into a life of farming and pastoralism. As\nthey interacted with indigenous peoples, a new period in India\u2019s history took shape. That period\nis known as the Vedic Age (1700 \u2013 600 BCE).\nDuring the long course of the Vedic Age, states formed in northern India. The surplus from\nfarming and pastoralism allowed people to engage in a multitude of other occupations and made\nfor a lively trade. Villages thus grew in number and some became towns. Consequently, there was\na need for greater leadership, something that was provided by chieftains of the many Aryan clans.\nOver time, higher levels of political organization developed, and these chieftains became kings\nor the leaders of clan assemblies. By the end of the Vedic Age, northern India was divided up by\nsixteen major kingdoms and oligarchies.\nThe ensuing three centuries (c. 600 \u2013 321 BCE) were a time of transition. These states fought\nwith each other over territory. The most successful state was the one that could most effectively\nadminister its land, mobilize its resources and, by so doing, field the largest armies. That state\nPage | 63 was the kingdom of Magadha which, by the fourth century BCE, had gained control of much of\nnorthern India along the Ganges River.\nIn 321 BCE, the last king of Magadha was overthrown by one of his subjects, Chandragupta\nMaurya, and a new period in India\u2019s history began. Through war and diplomacy, he and his two\nsuccessors established control over most of India, forging the first major empire in the history of\nSouth Asia: the Mauryan Empire (321 \u2013 184 BCE). Chandragupta\u2019s grandson, King Ashoka, ended\nthe military conquests and sought to rule his land through Buddhist principles of non-violence and\ntolerance. But after his time, the empire rapidly declined, and India entered a new stage in its history.\nAfter the Mauryan Empire fell, no one major power held control over a substantial part\nof India for five hundred years. Rather, from c. 200 BCE to 300 CE, India saw a fairly rapid\nturnover of numerous, regional kingdoms. Some of these were located in northern India, along\nthe Ganges River, but others grew up in the south\u2014the Indian Peninsula\u2014for the first time. Also,\nsome kingdoms emerged through foreign conquest. Outsiders in Central Asia and the Middle\nEast saw India as a place of much wealth, and sought to plunder or rule it. Thus, throughout\nits history, India was repeatedly invaded by conquerors coming through mountain passes in the\nnorthwest. Many of these, like King Kanishka of the Kushan Empire (c. 100 CE), established\nnotable kingdoms that extended from India into these neighboring regions from which they came.\nEven after 300 CE and up to the fifteenth century, India was never again unified for any length\nof time by one large empire. For that reason, historians highlight those kingdoms that became\nsubstantial regional powers and contributed in other important ways to India\u2019s civilization. The\nperiod 300 \u2013 600 CE, for instance, is often referred to as the Gupta Period and Classical Age.\nThe Guptas (c. 320 \u2013 550) were rulers who forged an impressive empire in northern India. As\ntheir empire flourished, Indian intellectuals were also setting standards for excellence in the fields\nof art, architecture, literature, and science, in part because of Gupta patronage. But important\nkingdoms also developed in south India.\nThe last period covered in this chapter is early medieval India (c. 600 \u2013 1300 CE). After the\nGupta Empire, and during the following seven centuries, the pattern of fragmentation intensified, as\nnumerous regional kingdoms large and small frequently turned over. Confronting such an unstable\nand fluid political scene, medieval kings granted land to loyal subordinate rulers and high officers\nof their courts. The resulting political and economic pattern is referred to as Indian feudalism. Also,\nkings put their greatness on display by waging war and building magnificent Hindu temples in their\ncapital cities. And, during the medieval period, a new political and religious force entered the Indian\nscene, when Muslim Arab and Turkic traders and conquerors arrived on the subcontinent.\nThis overview briefly summarizes major periods in India\u2019s political history. But the history of\na civilization consists of more than just rulers and states, which is why historians also pay close\nattention to social, cultural, and economic life every step of the way. This attention is especially\nimportant for India. Although the Asian subcontinent sees a long succession of kingdoms and\nempires and was usually divided up by several at any particular point in its history, peoples over\ntime came to share some things in common. Socially, the peoples of India were largely organized\nby the caste system. Culturally, the peoples of India shared in the development of Hinduism and\nBuddhism, two major religious traditions that shaped people\u2019s understanding of the world and their\nPage | 64 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nplace in it. Finally, throughout the ancient and medieval periods, India flourished as a civilization\nbecause of its dynamic economy. The peoples of India shared in that too, and that meant they were\nlinked in networks of trade and exchange not only with other parts of South Asia but also with\nneighboring regions of the Afro-Eurasian world.\n3.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

THE GEOGRAPHY OF SOUTH ASIA\nIndia\u2019s dynamic history, then, alternated between periods when the subcontinent was partially\nunified by empires and periods when it was composed of a shifting mosaic of regional states. This\nhistory was also impacted by influxes of migrants and invaders. In thinking about the reasons for\nthese patterns, historians highlight the size of India and its diverse geography and peoples.\nIt is important to remember that \u201cIndia\u201d can mean different things. Today, India usually\ndesignates the nation-state of India (see Map 3.1). But modern India only formed in 1947 and\nincludes much less territory than India did in ancient times. As a term, India was first invented by\nthe ancient Greeks to refer to the Indus River and the lands and people beyond it. When used\nin this sense, India also includes today\u2019s nation of Pakistan. In fact, for the purpose of studying\nearlier history, India can be thought of as the territory that includes at least seven countries today:\nIndia, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. This territory is also\nreferred to as South Asia or the Indian subcontinent.\nThe Indian subcontinent is where Indian civilization took shape. But that civilization was not\ncreated by one people, race, or ethnic group, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to see India\u2019s history as\nthe history of one Indian people. Rather, the history of this region was shaped by a multitude\nof ethnic groups who spoke many different languages and lived and moved about on a diverse\nterrain suited to many different kinds of livelihood.\nPage | 66 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nLarge natural boundaries define the\nsubcontinent. Mountain ranges ring\nthe north, and bodies of water surround\nthe rest. To the east lies the Bay of\nBengal, to the south the Indian Ocean,\nand to the west the Arabian Sea. The\nlargest mountain range is the Himalaya,\nwhich defines India\u2019s northern and\nnortheastern boundary. A subrange\nof the Himalaya\u2014the Hindu Kush\u2014\nsits at its western end, while a ridge\nrunning from north to south defines\nthe eastern end, dividing India from\nChina and mainland Southeast Asia.\nTo the northwest, the Suleiman Range\nand Kirthar Range complete what\nmight seem like impassable barriers.\nYet, these ranges are punctuated by a\nfew narrow passes that connect India\nto Central Asia and West Asia.\nTo the south of the mountain ranges\nlie the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the\nMap 3.1 | South Asia two great rivers of northern India that\nAuthor: Larry Israel\ncomprise it: the Indus River and the\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 Ganges River. These rivers originate\nin the Himalaya and are regularly fed\nby snow melt and monsoon rains. The Indus River, which is located in the northwest and drains\ninto the Arabian Sea, can be divided into an upper and lower region. The region comprising the\nupper Indus and its many tributary rivers is called the Punjab, while the region surrounding the\nlower Indus is referred to as the Sindh. The Ganges River begins in the western Himalaya and\nflows southeast across northern India before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Because they could\nsupport large populations, the plains surrounding these river systems served as the heartland for\nIndia\u2019s first major states and empires.\nPeninsular India is also an important part of the story because over time great regional kingdoms\nwill also emerge in the south. The peninsula is divided from northern India by the Vindhya Mountains,\nto the south of which lies the Deccan Plateau. This arid plateau is bordered by two coastal ranges\u2014\nthe Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats, beyond which are narrow coastal plains, the Malabar Coast\nand the Coromandel Coast. This nearly 4600 miles of coastline is important to India\u2019s history\nbecause it linked fishing and trading communities to the Indian Ocean and, therefore, the rest of\nAfro-Eurasia. Sri Lanka is an island located about thirty kilometers southeast of the southernmost\ntip of India, and also served as an important conduit for trade and cultural contacts beyond India.\nPage | 67 3.6 INDIA\u2019S FIRST MAJOR CIVILIZATION: THE INDUS\nVALLEY CIVILIZATION (2600 BCE \u2013 1700 BCE)\nA century of archaeological work in India that began in 1920 not only revealed a lost civilization\nbut also a massive one, surpassing in size other major early riverine civilizations of Afro-Eurasia,\nsuch as ancient Egypt and the Mesopotamian states. In an area spanning roughly a half million\nsquare miles, archaeologists have excavated thousands of settlements (see Map 3.2). These can\nbe envisioned in a hierarchy based on size and sophistication. The top consists of five major cities\nof roughly 250 acres each. One of those is Harappa, and because it was excavated first the entire\ncivilization was named Harappan Civilization. The bottom of the hierarchy consists of fifteen\nthousand smaller agricultural and craft villages of about 2.5 acres each, while between the top and\nbottom lie two tiers with several dozen towns ranging in size from 15 to 150 acres. Because the\nMap 3.2 | Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilization | Map of important Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilization cities\nand towns during its most developed period.\nAuthor: User \u201cAvantiputra7\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 68 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nmajority of these settlements were situated near the Indus River in the northwestern region of the\nsubcontinent, this civilization is also called the Indus Valley Civilization.\nAs with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, archaeologists have been able to sketch out how\nthis civilization evolved out of the simpler agricultural villages of the Neolithic period. On the\nsubcontinent, farming and the domestication of animals began c. 7000 BCE, about two thousand\nyears after they did in the Fertile Crescent. To the west of the Indus River, along the foothills of\nBaluchistan, the remains of numerous small villages have been found that date back to this time\n(see Map 3.3). One of these is Mehrgarh. Here, villagers lived in simple mud-brick structures,\ngrew barley and wheat, and raised cattle, sheep, and goats.\nOver the course of the next three thousand years, similar Neolithic communities sprang up\nnot only in northwest India but also in many other locations on the subcontinent. But it was to the\nMap 3.3 | Archaeological sites dating to northwest India\u2019s Neolithic period and the Indus Valley Civilization |\nAgricultural village societies first emerged to the west of the Indus and then spread to the Indus River and its many\ntributaries, as well as the Ghaggar-Hakra River (running parallel to and east of the Indus), which has since dried\nup. These provided the foundation for the emergence of towns and cities.\nAuthor: User \u201cAvantiputra7\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 69 west of the Indus River and then throughout neighboring fertile plains and valleys of the Punjab\nand Sindh that we see the transition to a more complex, urban-based civilization. Excavations\nthroughout this region show a pattern of development whereby settlements start looking more\nlike towns than villages: ground plans become larger, include the foundations of houses and\nstreets, and are conveniently located by the most fertile land or places for trade. Similar artifacts\nspread over larger areas show that the local communities building these towns were becoming\nlinked together in trade networks. Archaeologists date this transitional period when India was on\nthe verge of its first civilization from 5000 to 2600 BCE. The mature phase, with its full-blown\ncities, begins from 2600 BCE, roughly four centuries after the Sumerian city-states blossomed\nand Egypt was unified under one kingdom.\nThe ruins of Mohenjo-Daro and other Indus cities dating to this mature phase suggest a\nvibrant society thriving in competently planned and managed urban areas. Some of the principal\npurposes of these urban settlements included coordinating the distribution of local surplus\nresources, obtaining desired goods from more distant places, and turning raw materials into\ncommodities for trade. Mohenjo-Daro, for instance, was located along the lower reaches of the\nIndus (see Figure 3.2). That meant it was conveniently built amidst an abundance of resources:\nfertile flood plains for agriculture, pasture for grazing domesticated animals, and waters for fishing\nand fowling. The city itself consisted of several mounds\u2014elevated areas upon which structures\nand roads were built. A larger mound served as a core, fortified area where public functions\nlikely took place. It contained a wall and large buildings, including what archaeologists call a\nGreat Bath and Great Hall. Other mounds were the location of the residential and commercial\nsectors of the city. Major avenues laid out on a grid created city blocks. Within a block, multistory\ndwellings opening up to interior courtyards were constructed out of mudbricks or bricks baked in\nFigure 3.2 | Great Bath at Mohenjo-Daro | View of the Great Bath at Mohenjo-Daro, an Indus Valley city\nlocated along the lower reaches of the Indus River.

Particular attention was paid to\npublic sanitation. Residences not only\nhad private wells and baths, but also\ntoilets drained by earthenware pipes\nthat ushered the sewage into covered\ndrains located under the streets.\nArtifacts tell of city life. Farmers\nand pastoralists brought their grain\nand stock to the city for trade or to\nplace it in warehouses managed by the\nauthorities. Laborers dug the wells\nand collected trash from rectangular\nbins sitting beneath rubbish chutes.\nCraftsmen worked copper and tin\ninto bronze tools, fired ceramics, and\nmanufactured jewelry and beads out\nFigure 3.3 | Seals from Indus Valley cities | These were made\nof gold, copper, semi-precious stones,\nfrom fired steatite and used to imprint the identity of owners on goods.\nand ivory. Merchants travelling near Author: User \u201cMrABlair23\u201d\nand far carried raw materials and Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nfinished goods by bullock carts or boats to the dozens of\ntowns and cities throughout the region.\nSome goods also went to foreign lands. Harappan\ncities located along the coast of the Arabian Sea engaged\nin coastal shipping that brought goods as far as the Persian\nGulf and the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. In\nMesopotamian city-states, Harappan seals and beads\nhave been found, and Mesopotamian sources speak of a\ncertain place called \u201cMeluhha,\u201d a land with ivory, gold, and\nlapis lazuli. That was the Indus Valley Civilization. Cities\nlike Mohenjo-Daro were linked in networks of exchange\nextending in every direction.\nBut unlike ancient Egypt and Sumer, this civilization\nhas not yet provided sources we can read, and this\nFigure 3.4 | Indus Priest/King Statue | poses major problems of interpretation.

But the heroic efforts of philologists to decipher\nLicense: CC BY-SA 1.0\nPage | 71 the language have failed to yield results.\nThus, some historians call this civilization\nproto-historic, distinguishing it from both\nprehistoric cultures that have no writing\nand historic ones with written sources that\nwe can read.\nThis proto-historical state of the\nevidence leaves many questions concerning\nHarappan people\u2019s political organization\nand beliefs unanswered. On the one hand,\nmuch uniformity in the archaeological\nrecord across the region suggests\ncoordination in planning\u2014cities and towns\nwere similarly designed, fired bricks had the\nFigure 3.5 | Unicorn Seal | Mold from a \u201cunicorn\nseal\u201d from Mohenjo-Daro depicting a mythical animal\nstanding over an altar or trough, with writing above.\nAuthor: User \u201cIsmoon\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC0 1.0\nsame dimensions, and weights were standardized. On\nthe other hand, the ruins lack structures that can be\nclearly identified as palaces, temples, or large tombs.\nIn other words, there is little evidence for either a\ncentral political authority ruling over an empire or for\nindependent city-states. One intriguing artifact found\nin Mohenjo-Daro is a small sculpture of a bearded\nman made of soapstone (see Figure 3.4). The dignified\nappearance suggests he may have been a priest or king,\nor even both. Perhaps he and other priests purified\nthemselves in the Great Bath for ritual purposes. Yet,\nthis is purely speculation, as the sculpture is unique.\nHe may also have been a powerful landowner or\nwealthy merchant who met with others of a similar\nstatus in assemblies convened in the Great Hall of the\ncitadel. Perhaps local assemblies of just such elites\nFigure 3.6 | Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro governed each city.\nAuthor: Joe Ravi Religious beliefs are also difficult to determine.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nAgain, some of the principal evidence consists of\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 72 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nsmall artifacts such as figurines and the square seals. The seals were carved out of a soft stone\ncalled steatite and then fired so they would harden. They contain images of animals and humans,\ntypically with writing above. Mostly, they were used to imprint the identity of a merchant or\nauthorities on goods. However, some of the images may have had religious significance. For\nexample, hundreds of \u201cunicorn seals\u201d display images of a mythical animal that resembles a species\nof cattle (see Figure 3.5). These cattle are usually placed over an object variously interpreted as\na trough or altar. Perhaps these were symbols of deities or animals used for sacrificial rituals.\nEqually as interesting are the numerous female clay figurines. These may have been used for\nfertility rituals or to pay homage to a goddess (see Figure 3.6).\nThe decline of Harappan civilization set in from 1900 BCE and was complete two hundred\nyears later. Stated simply, the towns and cities and their lively trade networks faded away, and the\nregion reverted to rural conditions. Likely causes include geologic, climatic, and environmental\nfactors. Movement by tectonic plates may have led to earthquakes, flooding, and shifts in the course\nof the Indus. Less rainfall and deforestation may have degraded the environment\u2019s suitability for\nfarming. All of these factors would have impacted the food supply. Consequently, urban areas and\nthe civilization they supported were slowly starved out of existence.\n3.7 THE LONG VEDIC AGE (1700 \u2013 600 BCE)\nBy 1700 BCE, Harappan Civilization had collapsed. In northwest India, scattered village\ncommunities engaging in agriculture and pastoralism replaced the dense and more highly\npopulated network of cities, towns, and villages of the third millennium. The rest of northern\nIndia too (including the Ganges River), as well as the entire subcontinent, were similarly dotted\nwith Neolithic communities of farmers and herders. That is what the archaeological record\ndemonstrates.\nThe next stage in India\u2019s history is the Vedic Age (1700 \u2013 600 BCE). This period is named\nafter a set of religious texts composed during these centuries called the Vedas. The people who\ncomposed them are known as the Vedic peoples and Indo-Aryans. They were not originally from\nIndia, and rather came as migrants travelling to the subcontinent via mountain passes located in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan. The Aryans first settled in the Punjab, but then they pushed east along\nthe Ganges, eventually impressing their way of life, language, and religious beliefs upon much\nof northern India. The course of India\u2019s history was completely changed during this period. By\nthe end of the Vedic Age, numerous states had emerged and Hinduism and the varna social\nsystem were beginning to take shape.\n3.7.1 The Early Aryan Settlement of Northern India (1700 \u2013 1000 BCE)\nThe early history of the Vedic Age offers the historian little primary source material. For example,\nfor the first half of the Vedic Age (1700 \u2013 1000 BCE), we are largely limited to archaeological sites\nand one major text called the Rig Veda. This is the first of four Vedas. It consists of 1028 hymns\naddressed to the Vedic peoples\u2019 pantheon of gods. But it wasn\u2019t actually written down until after\n500 BCE. Rather, from as early as the beginning of the second millennium BCE, these hymns were\nPage | 73 orally composed and transmitted by Aryan poet-seers, eventually becoming the preserve of a few\npriestly clans who utilized them for the specific religious function of pleasing higher powers. Thus,\nthese hymns only offer certain kinds of information. Yet, despite these limits, historians have\nbeen able to sketch out the Aryan\u2019s way of life in these early centuries, as well as to make solid\narguments about how they came to India.\nThe Indo-Aryans were pastoralists who migrated to India in waves beginning c. 1700 BCE (see\nMap 3.4). They referred to themselves as Aryans, a term meaning \u201cnoble\u201d or \u201crespectable.\u201d They\nspoke Sanskrit, and used it to transmit their sacred hymns. At first, in search of land, they settled\nalong the hills and plains of the upper reaches of the Indus River and its tributaries, bringing with\nthem their pastoral and farming way of life. In their hymns, the Aryans beseech the gods to bless\nthem with cattle, bounteous harvests, rain, friends, wealth, fame, and sons. From these, it is clear\nthat herding was the principal occupation and cows were especially prized. But the Aryans also\nfarmed, as apparent in hymns that speak of plough teams and the cutting and threshing of grain.\nMap 3.4 | Early Vedic Culture (1700-1000 BCE) | The early Vedic Age, showing the Aryan\u2019s migration routes\nand the areas where they first resided in the Punjab.\nAuthor: User \u201cAvantiputra7\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 74 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nDuring these early centuries, led by their pastoral chiefs, some Aryans retained a semi-\nnomadic way of life, living in temporary dwellings and then moving about with their herds or\nmigrating further. Others settled down in villages. In both cases, kinship was especially valued.\nAt the simplest level, society consisted of extended families of three generations. Fathers were\nexpected to lead the family as patriarchal heads, while sons were expected to care for the herds,\nbring honor through success in battle, and sacrifice for the well-being of their fathers\u2019 souls after\ndeath. They also inherited the property and family name. This suggests that, as is so often the\ncase for ancient societies, men were dominant and women were subordinate. Yet, women\u2019s roles\nweren\u2019t as rigidly defined as they would be in later times, and they had some choice in marriage\nand could remarry.\nSeveral extended families, in turn, made up clans, and the members of a clan shared land and\nherds. Groups of larger clans also constituted tribes. The Vedas speak of rajas who, at this point,\nare best understood as clan or tribal chieftains. These men protected their people and led in times\nof battle, for the clans and tribes fought with each other and with the indigenous villagers living\nin the northwest prior to the Aryan migrations. In times of war, these chiefs would rely on priests\nwho ensured the support of the gods by reciting hymns and sacrificing to them. At assemblies of\nkinsmen and other wealthy and worthy men from the clan, the rajas distributed war booty. Sudas,\nfor example, was the chief of the Bharata clan. After settling in the Punjab, the Bharatas were\nattacked by neighboring clan confederacies, but drawing on his skills in chariot warfare and the\nsupport of priests, Sudas successfully fought them off.\nMore than anything else, the Rig Veda reveals the Aryan\u2019s religious ideas. For them, the\nuniverse was composed of the sky, earth, and netherworld. These realms were populated by a host\nof divinities and demons responsible for the good and evil and order and disorder blessing and\nafflicting the human world. Although one Vedic hymn gives a total of thirty-three gods, many more\nare mentioned. That means early Vedic religion was polytheistic. These human-like powers lying\nbehind all those natural phenomena so close to a people living out on the plains were associated\nwith the forces of light, good, and order. By chanting hymns to them and sacrificing in the correct\nway, the Aryan priests might secure blessings for the people or prevent the demons and spirits on\nearth from causing sickness and death. They might also ensure that the souls of the dead would\nsuccessfully reach the netherworld, where the spirits of righteous Fathers feasted with King Yama,\nthe first man to die.\nApproaching the gods required neither temples nor images. Rather, a fire was lit in a specially\nprepared sacrificial altar. This might take place in a home when the family patriarch was hoping\nfor a son or on an open plot of land when the clan chieftain wished to secure the welfare of his\npeople. Priests were called in to perform the ceremony. They would imbibe a hallucinogenic\nbeverage squeezed from a plant of uncertain identity and chant hymns while oblations of butter,\nfruit, and meat were placed in the fire. The gods, it was believed, would descend onto grass strewn\nabout for them and could partake of the offerings once they were transmuted by the fire.\nIndra was among the most beloved of the Vedic gods. As a god of war and the storm, and\nas king of the gods, Indra exemplified traits men sought to embody in their lives. He is a great\nwarrior who smites demons and enemies but who also provides generously for the weak. Agni,\nPage | 75 another favorite, was god of fire and the household hearth. Agni summons the gods to the sacrifice\nand, as intermediary between gods and humans, brings the sacrificial offering to them.\n3.7.2 The Origins of the Aryan People and the Indo-European Hypothesis\nBecause the Aryans came to India as migrating pastoralists from mountainous regions to\nthe northwest of the Indian subcontinent, historians have sought to understand their origins.\nSanskrit has provided important clues because it contains features similar to languages spoken\nat some point in Europe, Iran, and Central Asia. For example, although they are vastly different\nlanguages, Latin, Persian, and Sanskrit share similar sounds, vocabulary, and grammar.\nOn the basis of these shared traits, linguists have constructed a kind of family tree that shows\nthe historical relationship between these languages (see Figure 3.7). Sanskrit belongs to a group\nof languages used in northern India called Indo-Aryan. These languages are closely related to\nlanguages used throughout history in neighboring Iran. Together, all of these are called the Indo-\nFigure 3.7 | Proto-Indo-European Family | Chart showing the relationship between some\nlanguages in the Indo-European Family. Note the location of Sanskrit.\nAuthor: Jack Lynch\nSource: Rutgers\nLicense: \u00a9 Jack Lynch. Used with permission.\nPage | 76 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nIranian language group. This language group is in turn one of nine branches of related language\ngroups comprising the Indo-European language family.\nLinguists assume these distantly-related languages share a common ancestor. They label that\nancestral language proto-Indo-European and the people who spoke it Indo-Europeans. They\nposit a scenario whereby, in stages and over time, groups of these peoples migrated from their\nhomeland to neighboring areas and settled down. Since this process happened over the course\nof many centuries and involved much interaction with other peoples along the way, the ancestral\nlanguage evolved into many different ones while retaining some of the original features.\nOne question, then, is the location of this homeland and the history of the peoples who spoke\nthese languages as they changed. Many places have been proposed, but at present the most\nwidely accepted scenario puts this\nhomeland in the steppe lands of\nsouthern Russia, just to the north\nof the Black Sea and Caspian Sea\n(see Map 3.5).\nEvidence from archaeological\nsites suggests that during the third\nmillennium an Indo-European\npeople lived in this region as\nsemi-nomadic pastoralists. They\nwere likely the first to domesticate\nthe horse and also improved the\nchariot by adding lighter, spoked\nwheels. They lived in tribes made\nMap 3.5 | Indo-European Migrations | The area highlighted in\nup of extended families and pink, lying between the Black and Caspian Seas, is the suggested\nworshipped numerous sky gods homeland for Indo-Europeans in the third millennium BCE.

By 2000 BCE, Indo-Iranian speaking pastoralists were living on the Iranian Plateau and\nin Afghanistan. Some among these evolved into the Indo-Aryan speakers living to the northwest\nof the Indus. It is these peoples that began to arrive in the Punjab from c. 1700 BCE, with their\nVedic religion, kinship-based social order, and pastoral and farming way of life.\n3.7.3 The Later Vedic Age (1000 \u2013 600 BCE)\nDuring the early centuries of the Vedic Age, the world of the Aryan tribes was the rural setting of\nthe Punjab. Some settlers, however, migrated east to the upper reaches of the Ganges River, setting\nPage | 77 the stage for the next period in India\u2019s history, the later Vedic Age. The later Vedic Age differs from\nthe early Vedic Age in that during these centuries lands along the Ganges River were colonized by\nthe Aryans and their political, economic, social, and religious life became more complex.\nOver the course of these four centuries, Aryan tribes, with horses harnessed to chariots\nand wagons drawn by oxen, drove their herds east, migrating along and colonizing the plains\nsurrounding the Ganges. Historians debate whether this happened through conquest and warfare\nor intermittent migration led by traders and people seeking land and opportunity. Regardless, by\n600 BCE the Aryans had reached the lower reaches of the Ganges and as far south as the Vindhya\nRange and the Deccan Plateau. Most of northern India would therefore be shaped by the Aryan\nway of life. But in addition, as they moved into these areas, the Aryans encountered indigenous\npeoples and interacted with them, eventually imposing their way of life on them but also adopting\nmany elements of their languages and customs.\nDuring this time, agriculture became more important and occupations more diverse. As\nthe lands were cleared, village communities formed. Two new resources made farming more\nproductive: iron tools and rice. Implements such as iron axes and ploughs made clearing\nwilderness and sowing fields easier, and rice paddy agriculture produced more calories per unit\nof land. Consequently, population began to grow and people could more easily engage in other\noccupations. By the end of this period, the earliest towns had started to form.\nPolitical changes accompanied economic developments. Looking ahead at sixth-century\nnorthern India, the landscape was dominated by kingdoms and oligarchies. That raises the\nquestion of the origins of these two different kinds of states, where different types of central\nauthority formally governed a defined territory. Clearly, these states began to emerge during the\nlater Vedic Age, especially after the eighth century.\nPrior to this state formation, chiefs (rajas) and their assemblies, with the assistance of priests,\nsaw to the well-being of their clans. This clan-based method of governing persisted and evolved\ninto oligarchies. As the Aryans colonized new territory, clans or confederacies of clan would claim\nit as their possession, and name it after the ruling family. The heads of clan families or chiefs\nof each clan in a confederacy then jointly governed the territory by convening periodically in\nassembly halls. A smaller group of leaders managed the deliberations and voting, and carried out\nthe tasks of day-to-day governing. These kinds of states have been called oligarchies because the\nheads of the most powerful families governed. They have also been called republics because these\nelites governed by assembly.\nBut in other territories clan chiefs became kings. These kings elevated themselves over\nkinsmen and the assemblies and served as the pivot of an embryonic administrative system.\nTheir chief priests conducted grand rituals that demonstrated the king\u2019s special relation with the\ngods, putting the people in awe of him and giving them the sense that they would be protected.\nTreasurers managed the obligatory gifts kings expected in return. Most importantly, kingship\nbecame hereditary, and dynasties started to rule (see Map 3.6).\nSociety changed too. In earlier times, Aryan society was organized as a fluid three-class social\nstructure consisting of priests, warriors, and commoners. But during the later Vedic Age, this\nsocial structure became more hierarchical and rigid. A system for classifying people based on\nPage | 78 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nMap 3.6 | The Late Vedic Age (1000-600 BCE) | The area highlighted in pink, lying between the Black and\nCaspian Seas, is the suggested homeland for Indo-Europeans in the third millennium BCE.

These\ncategories are known as varnas, and there were four of them: Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and\nShudra. The Brahmins were the priests, whose duty was to memorize and orally transmit the\nVedas and perform sacrifices so as to maintain good relations with the gods. The Kshatriya were\nthe chiefs and warriors, whose duty was to govern well and fight. The Vaishya were commoners\nwho traded and farmed. They were responsible for society\u2019s material prosperity. The Shudras\nwere servants who labored for others, usually as artisans or by performing menial tasks.\nVarnas became hereditary social classes. That means a person was born into one of these\nand usually remained there for life, pursuing an occupation included in and marrying someone\nbelonging to that varna. Varna has also been translated as ritual status. Your varna determined\nhow pure or polluted you were, and thus what level of participation in rituals you would be allowed\nPage | 79 and also who you could associate with. Varna thus defined a social hierarchy. The Brahmins\nwere the purest and most honored. Warriors were respected for their leadership and supported\nthe Brahmins, who affirmed their authority by carrying out royal ceremonies. Together, they\ndominated society. The Shudras (servants) were the most polluted and could not participate in\nany sacrifice or speak freely to members of other varnas. Over time, this way of organizing society\ncame to be viewed as normal and natural.\nDuring the later Vedic Age, the religion of the Aryans also developed in new directions. As one\nof the world\u2019s major religious traditions, Hinduism is multi-faceted and contains many layers of\nhistorical development. The earliest layer is called Brahmanism. Brahmanism begins with the\nRig Veda, which presents a universe controlled by a host of divinities. During the early Vedic Age,\nthe Aryans explained the world through myths about these higher powers, and their priests sought\nto influence them through sacrificial ceremonies. These priests become the Brahmin varna.\nThis early layer persisted and became even more elaborate. Three new Vedas were added to\nthe Rig Veda, as well as two sets of texts called Brahmanas and Upanishads. Combined, this\nliterature, which was composed in Sanskrit, constituted the full Vedic corpus, and became the\npreserve of the Brahmins.\nThe Brahmins weren\u2019t content with the 1028 hymns of the Rig Veda. Later Vedas set the\nhymns to music, added prose formulas that were to be uttered in the course of sacrificing to the\ndivinities, and offered spells and incantations for achieving such goals as warding off disease and\nwinning a battle. The Brahmanas were primarily handbooks of ritual for the Brahmins. They\nexplained the meaning of the sacrifices and how to carry them out. Clearly, the Brahmins were\nbecoming ever more conscious of their role in keeping the universe in good working order by\npleasing and assisting the gods and consecrating kings. Their sacrificial observances became all\nthe more elaborate, and an essential component of good kingship.\nThe Upanishads, however, added an entirely new set of ideas. The title means \u201csitting near\u201d and\npoints to a setting where sages conveyed spiritual insights to students through dialogue, stories,\nand analogies. The Upanishads are records of what was taught and discussed, the earliest dating\nto the eighth and seventh centuries BCE. These sages were likely hermits and wanderers who felt\nspiritually dissatisfied with the mythological and ritualistic approach of Brahmanism. Rather,\nthey sought deeper insight into the nature of reality, the origins of the universe, and the human\ncondition. The concepts that appear throughout these records of the outcome of their search are\nbrahman (not to be confused with Brahmins), atman, transmigration, and karma.\nAccording to these sages, human beings face a predicament. The universe they live in is created\nand destroyed repeatedly over the course of immense cycles of time, and humans wander through\nit in an endless succession of deaths and rebirths. This wandering is known as transmigration, a\nprocess that isn\u2019t random, but rather determined by the law of karma. According to this law, good\nacts bring a better rebirth, and bad acts a worse one. It may not happen in this lifetime, but one\nday virtue will be rewarded and evil punished.\nUltimately, however, the goal is to be liberated from the cycle of death and rebirth. According\nto Hindu traditions, the Upanishads reflect spiritual knowledge that was revealed to sages who\nundertook an inward journey through withdrawal from the world and meditation. What they\nPage | 80 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\ndiscovered is that one divine reality underlies the universe. They called this ultimate reality\nbrahman. They also discovered that deep within the heart of each person lies the eternal soul. They\ncalled this soul atman. Through quieting the mind and inquiry, the individual can discover atman\nand its identity with brahman: the soul is the divine reality. That is how a person is liberated from\nthe illusion of endless wandering.\nIn conclusion, by the end of the Vedic Age, northern India had undergone immense changes.\nAn Aryan civilization emerged and spread across the Indo-Gangetic Plains. This civilization was\ncharacterized by the Brahmin\u2019s religion (Brahmanism), the use of Sanskrit, and the varna social\nsystem. The simpler rural life of the clans of earlier times was giving way to the formation of states,\nand new religious ideas were being added to the evolving tradition known today as Hinduism.\n3.8 TRANSITION TO EMPIRE: STATES, CITIES, AND NEW\nRELIGIONS (600 TO 321 BCE)\nThe sixth century begins a transitional period in India\u2019s history marked by important\ndevelopments. Some of these bring to fruition processes that gained momentum during the late\nVedic Age. Out of the hazy formative stage of state development, sixteen powerful kingdoms and\noligarchies emerged. By the end of this period, one will dominate. Accompanying their emergence,\nIndia entered a second stage of urbanization, as towns and cities become a prominent feature of\nnorthern India. Other developments were newer. The caste system took shape as an institution,\ngiving Indian society one of its most distinctive traits. Lastly, new religious ideas were put forward\nthat challenged the dominance of Brahmanism.\n3.8.1 States and Cities\nThe kingdom of Magadha became the most powerful among the sixteen states that dominated\nthis transitional period, but only over time. At the outset, it was just one of eleven located up and\ndown the Ganges River (see Map 3.7). The rest were established in the older northwest or central\nIndia. In general, larger kingdoms dominated the Ganges basin while smaller clan-based states\nthrived on the periphery. They all fought with each other over land and resources, making this a\ntime of war and shifting alliances.\nThe victors were the states that could field the largest armies. To do so, rulers had to mobilize\nthe resources of their realms. The Magadhan kings did this most effectively. Expansion began\nin 545 BCE under King Bimbisara. His kingdom was small, but its location to the south of the\nlower reaches of the Ganges River gave it access to fertile plains, iron ore, timber, and elephants.\nGoverning from his inland fortress at Rajagriha, Bimbisara built an administration to extract\nthese resources and used them to form a powerful military. After concluding marriage alliances\nwith states to the north and west, he attacked and defeated the kingdom of Anga to the east.\nHis son Ajatashatru, after killing his father, broke those alliances and waged war on the Kosala\nKingdom and the Vrijji Confederacy. Succeeding kings of this and two more Magadhan dynasties\ncontinued to conquer neighboring states down to 321 BCE, thus forging an empire. But its reach\nwas largely limited to the middle and lower reaches of the Ganges River.\nPage | 81 Map 3.7 | The most powerful states of the sixth century BCE | Mahajanapadas\nrefers to the great kingdoms and oligarchies stretching along the Indo-Gangetic\nplains. The two capitals of Magadha\u2013Rajagriha and Pataliputra\u2013are also indicated.\nAuthor: User \u201cKmusser\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY 2.5\nTo the northwest, external powers gained control. As we have seen, the mountain ranges defining\nthat boundary contain passes permitting the movement of peoples. This made the northwest a\ncrossroads, and, at times, the peoples crossing through were the armies of rulers who sought to\ncontrol the riches of India. Outside powers located in Afghanistan, Iran, or beyond might extend\npolitical control into the subcontinent, making part of it a component in a larger empire.\nOne example is the Persian Empire (see Chapter 5). During the sixth century, two kings, Cyrus\nthe Great and Darius I, made this empire the largest in its time. From their capitals on the Iranian\nPlateau, they extended control as far as the Indus River, incorporating parts of northwest India\nas provinces of the Persian Empire (see Map 3.8). Another example is Alexander the Great (also\nsee Chapter 5). Alexander was the king of Macedon, a Greek state. After compelling other Greeks\nto follow him, he attacked the Persian Empire, defeating it in 331 BCE. That campaign took his\nforces all the way to mountain ranges bordering India. Desiring to find the end of the known\nworld and informed of the riches of India, Alexander took his army through the Khyber Pass and\noverran a number of small states and cities located in the Punjab. But to Alexander\u2019s dismay, his\nsoldiers refused to go any further, forcing him to turn back. They were exhausted from years of\ncampaigning far from home and discouraged by news of powerful Indian states to the east. One of\nthose was the kingdom of Magadha (see Map 3.9).\nPage | 82 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nMap 3.8 | Afro-Eurasia in 500 BCE | Note how India is divided up among numerous polities, and\nhow a large Persian Empire is reaching from the Middle East into northwest India.\nAuthor: Thomas Lessman\nSource: Talessman\u2019s Atlas of World History\nLicense: \u00a9 Thomas Lessman.

Used with permission.\nPage | 83 Magadha\u2019s first capital\u2014Rajagriha\u2014is one of many cities and towns with ruins dating back\nto this transitional period. Urban centers were sparse during the Vedic Age but now blossomed,\nmuch like they did during the mature phase of the Harappan Civilization. Similar processes\nwere at work. As more forests were cleared and marshes drained, the agricultural economy of\nthe Ganges basin produced ever more surplus food. Population grew, enabling more people to\nmove into towns and engage in other occupations as craftsmen, artisans, and traders. Kings\nencouraged this economic growth as its revenue enriched their treasuries. Caravans of ox-drawn\ncarts or boats laden with goods travelling from state to state could expect to encounter the king\u2019s\ncustoms officials and pay tolls. So important were rivers to accessing these trade networks that the\nMagadhan kings moved their capital to Pataliputra, a port town located on the Ganges (see Map\n3.7). Thus, it developed as a hub of both political power and economic exchange. Most towns and\ncities began as one or the other, or as places of pilgrimage.\n3.8.2 The Caste System\nAs the population of northern India rose and the landscape was dotted with more villages,\ntowns, and cities, society became more complex. The social life of a Brahmin priest who served the\nking differed from that of a blacksmith who belonged to a town guild, a rich businessman residing\nin style in a city, a wealthy property owner, or a poor agricultural laborer living in a village. Thus,\nthe social identity of each member of society differed.\nIn ancient India, one measure of identity and the way people imagined their social life and\nhow they fit together with others was the varna system of four social classes. Another was\ncaste. Like the varnas, castes were hereditary social classifications; unlike them, they were far\nmore distinct social groups. The four-fold varna system was more theoretical and important for\nestablishing clearly who the powerful spiritual and political elites in society were: the Brahmins\nand Kshatriya. But others were more conscious of their caste. There were thousands of these,\nand each was defined by occupation, residence, marriage, customs, and language. In other\nwords, because \u201cI\u201d was born into such-and-such a caste, my role in society is to perform this\nkind of work. \u201cI\u201d will be largely confined to interacting with and marrying members of this same\ngroup. Our caste members reside in this area, speak this language, hold these beliefs, and are\ngoverned by this assembly of elders. \u201cI\u201d will also be well aware of who belongs to other castes,\nand whether or not \u201cI\u201d am of a higher or lower status in relation to them, or more or less pure.\nOn that basis, \u201cI\u201d may or may not be able, for instance, to dine with them. That is how caste\ndefined an individual\u2019s life.\nThe lowest castes were the untouchables. These were peoples who engaged in occupations\nconsidered highly impure, usually because they were associated with taking life; such occupations\ninclude corpse removers, cremators, and sweepers. So those who practiced such occupations\nwere despised and pushed to the margins of society. Because members of higher castes believed\ntouching or seeing them was polluting, untouchables were forced to live outside villages and\ntowns, in separate settlements.\nPage | 84 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\n3.8.3 The Challenge to Brahmanism: Buddhism\nDuring this time of transition, some individuals became dissatisfied with life and chose to leave\nthe everyday world behind. Much like the sages of the Upanishads, these renunciants, as they\nwere known, were people who chose to renounce social life and material things in order that they\nmight gain deeper insight into the meaning of life. Some of them altogether rejected Brahmanism\nand established their own belief systems. The most renowned example is Siddhartha Gautama\n(c. 563 \u2013 480 BCE), who is otherwise known as the Buddha.\nBuddha means \u201cEnlightened One\u201d or \u201cAwakened One,\u201d implying that the Buddha was at one\ntime spiritually asleep but at some point woke up and attained insight into the truth regarding the\nhuman condition. His life story is therefore very important to Buddhists, people who follow the\nteachings of the Buddha.\nSiddhartha was born a prince, son to the chieftain of Shakya, a clan-based state located at the\nfoothills of the Himalaya in northern India. His father wished for him to be a ruler like himself,\nbut Siddhartha went in a different direction. At twenty-nine, after marrying and having a son, he\nleft home. Legends attribute this departure to his having encountered an old man, a sick man, a\ncorpse, and a wandering renunciant while out on an excursion. Aging, sickness, and death posed the\nquestion of suffering for Siddhartha, leading him to pursue spiritual insight. For years, he sought\ninstruction from other wanderers and experimented with their techniques for liberating the self\nfrom suffering through meditation and asceticism. But he failed to obtain the answers he sought.\nThen, one day, while seated beneath a tree meditating for an extended period of time, a\ndeepening calm descended upon Siddhartha, and he experienced nirvana. He also obtained\ninsight into the reasons for human suffering and what was needful to end it. This insight was\nat the heart of his teachings for the remaining forty-five years of his life. During that time, he\ntravelled around northern India teaching his dharma\u2014his religious ideas and practices\u2014and\ngained a following of students.\nThe principal teaching of the Buddha, presented at his first sermon, is called the Four Noble\nTruths. The first is the noble truth of suffering. Based on his own experiences, the Buddha\nconcluded that life is characterized by suffering not only in an obvious physical and mental sense,\nbut also because everything that promises pleasure and happiness is ultimately unsatisfactory\nand impermanent. The second noble truth states that the origin of suffering is an unquenchable\nthirst. People are always thirsting for something more, making for a life of restlessness with no\nend in sight. The third noble truth is that there is a cure for this thirst and the suffering it brings:\nnirvana. Nirvana means \u201cblowing out,\u201d implying extinction of the thirst and the end of suffering.\nNo longer striving to quell the restlessness with temporary enjoyments, people can awaken to\n\u201cthe city of nirvana, the place of highest happiness, peaceful, lovely, without suffering, without\nfear, without sickness, free from old age and death.\u201d1 The fourth noble truth is the Eight-Fold\nPath, a set of practices that leads the individual to this liberating knowledge. The Buddha taught\nthat through a program of study of Buddhist teachings (right understanding, right attitude),\nmoral conduct (right speech, right action, right livelihood), and meditation (right effort, right\n1 Rupert Gethin, The Foundations of Buddhism (Oxford University Press, 1998), 79.\nPage | 85 concentration, right mindfulness), anyone could become a Buddha. Everyone has the potential to\nawaken, but each must rely on his or her own determination.\nAfter the Buddha died c. 480 BCE, his students established monastic communities known\nas the Buddhist sangha. Regardless of their varna or caste, both men and women could choose\nto leave home and enter a monastery as a monk or nun. They would shave their heads, wear\nochre-colored robes, and vow to take refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and sangha. Doing so meant\nfollowing the example of the Buddha and his teachings on morality and meditation, as well as\nliving a simple life with like-minded others in pursuit of nirvana and an end to suffering.\n3.9 THE MAURYAN EMPIRE (321 \u2013 184 BCE)\nThe kingdom of Magadha was the most powerful state in India when the Nanda Dynasty\ncame to power in 364 BCE. Nine Nanda kings made it even greater, by improving methods of tax\ncollection and administration, funding irrigation projects and canal building, and maintaining an\nimpressive army of infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.\nBut Nanda aspirations were cut short when they were overthrown by Chandragupta\nMaurya (r. 321 \u2013 297 BCE), who began a new period in India\u2019s history. He and his son Bindusara\n(r. 287 \u2013 273 BCE) and grandson Ashoka (r. 268 \u2013 232 BCE) were destined to forge the first\nlarge empire in India\u2019s\nhistory, one that would\ninspire the imagination of\nlater empire builders in\nSouth Asia. The Mauryan\nEmpire included most\nof the subcontinent and\nlasted for 140 years (see\nMap 3.10)\nConflicting accounts\nmake it difficult to say\nanything definitive about\nthe first two kings. Chan-\ndragupta may have come\nfrom a Kshatriya (war-\nrior) clan, or a Vaishya\n(commoner) clan of pea-\ncock-tamers. In his youth,\nhe spent time in the\nnorthwest, where he en-\nMap 3.10 | Mauryan Empire during the reign of King Ashoka | Note the\ncountered Alexander the location of the capital, Pataliputra.\nGreat.

Thereafter, through diplomacy and war, he secured control over central and\nnorthern India.\nKautilya, whose advice may have been critical to Chandragupta\u2019s success, is viewed as the\nauthor of the Arthashastra, a treatise on statecraft. This handbook for kings covered in detail\nthe arts of governing, diplomacy, and warfare. To help ensure centralization of power in the\nruler\u2019s hands, it provided a blueprint of rules and regulations necessary to maintain an efficient\nbureaucracy, a detailed penal code, and advice on how to deploy spies and informants.\nChandragupta\u2019s campaigns ended when he concluded a treaty with Seleucus Nicator in 301\nBCE. After Alexander the Great retreated from India and then died, a struggle for his empire\nbroke out among his generals. Seleucus was one of them. He gained control of the eastern half\nand sought to reclaim northwest\nIndia. But he was confronted by\nChandragupta, defeated, and\nforced to surrender the Indus\nBasin and much of Afghanistan,\ngiving the Mauryan Empire control\nover trade routes to West Asia.\nThe treaty, however, established\nfriendly relations between the\ntwo rulers, for in exchange for\nhundreds of elephants, Seleucus\ngave Chandragupta a daughter\nin marriage and dispatched an\nenvoy to his court. Hellenistic\nkings (see Chapter 5) maintained\ncommercial and diplomatic ties\nwith India.\nMilitary expansion continued\nunder Bindusara and Ashoka until\nall but the tip of the subcontinent\ncame under the empire\u2019s control.\nWith King Ashoka, however,\nwarfare came to an end. We know\nfar more about him because he\nleft behind a fascinating record\ntelling much about his ideas on\ngoverning. He had edicts inscribed\nMap 3.11 | Location of the rock edicts and pillars of King Ashoka\non rocks throughout the realm and Author: User \u201cPHGCOM\u201d\non sandstone pillars erected in the Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nGanges heartland (see Map 3.11).\nPage | 87 He then placed them in populous areas where people usually gathered, so that his officials could\nread them to his largely illiterate subjects.\nOne rock edict speaks to why King Ashoka decided to renounce violence. While waging war\nagainst a small state located along the east coast, he was deeply disturbed by the amount of\nsuffering and dislocation the war heaped upon innocent people\u2019s lives. This realization caused\nhim to redouble his faith in the Buddha. Ashoka, it turns out, was a lay follower of Buddhism.\nIn his edicts, he proclaimed to his subjects that the sound of the drum would be replaced\nby the sound of the dharma. In ancient India, dharma meant universal law. For the Brahmin\npriests, for example, dharma meant a society and religious order founded on Vedic principles and\nthe caste system. For Buddhists, dharma consisted of the truths taught by the Buddha. For kings,\ndharma was enlightened governing and just rule. Thus, Ashoka was proclaiming that he would\nnow rule by virtue, not force.\nAshoka\u2019s kingly dharma was shaped by his personal practice of Buddhism. This dharma\nconsisted of laws of ethical behavior and right conduct fashioned from Indian traditions of kingship\nand his understanding of Buddhist principles. To gain his subject\u2019s willing obedience, he sought to\ninspire a sense of gratitude by presenting himself in the role of a father looking out for his children.\nHe told his subjects that he was appointing officers to tour his realm and attend to the welfare\nand happiness of all. Justice was to be impartially administered and medical treatment provided\nfor animals and humans. A principle of non-injury to all beings was to be observed. Following\nthis principle meant not only renouncing state violence, but also forbidding slaughtering certain\nanimals for sacrifices or for cooking in the royal kitchen. Ashoka also proclaimed that he would\nreplace his pleasure and hunting tours with dharma tours. During these, he promised to give gifts\nto Brahmins and the aged and to visit people in the countryside.\nIn return, Ashoka asked his subjects to observe certain principles. He knew his empire was\npluralistic, consisting of many peoples with different cultures and beliefs. He believed that if\nhe instilled certain values in these peoples, then his realm might be knit together in peace and\nharmony. Thus, in addition to non-injury, Ashoka taught forbearance. He exhorted his subjects\nto respect parents, show courtesy to servants, and, more generally, be liberal, compassionate,\nand truthful in their treatment of others. These values were also to be embraced by religious\ncommunities, since Ashoka did not want people fighting over matters of faith.\nThe king\u2019s writ shaped the government because kings were the heart of it. They were advised by\na council of ministers and served by high officials who oversaw the major functions of the state. The\nMauryans were particularly concerned with efficient revenue collection and uniform administration\nof justice. To that end, they divided the empire into a hierarchy of provinces and districts and\nappointed officials to manage matters at each level. But given such an immense empire spread over\na geographically and ethnically diverse territory, the level of Mauryan control varied. Historians\nrecognize three broad zones. The first was the metropolitan region\u2014with its capital Pataliputra\u2014\nlocated on the Ganges Plain. This heartland was tightly governed. The second zone consisted of\nconquered regions of strategic and economic importance. These provinces were placed under the\ncontrol of members of the royal family and senior officials, but state formation was slower. That is,\nthe tentacles of bureaucracy did not reach as deeply into local communities. Lastly, the third zone\nPage | 88 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nconsisted of hinterlands sparsely populated by tribes of foragers and nomads. Here, state control\nwas minimal, amounting to little more than establishing workable relations with chieftains.\nAfter King Ashoka\u2019s reign, the Mauryan Empire declined. The precise reasons for this decline\nare unknown. Kings enjoyed only brief reigns during the final fifty years of the empire\u2019s existence,\nso they may have been weak. Since loyalty to the ruler was one element of the glue that held the\ncentralized bureaucracy together, weak kings may explain why the political leaders of provinces\npulled away and the empire fragmented into smaller states. Furthermore, the Mauryan court\u2019s\ndemand for revenue sufficient to sustain the government and a large standing army may have\ncontributed to discontent. In 184 BCE, the last king was assassinated by his own Brahmin military\ncommander, and India\u2019s first major imperial power came to an end.\n3.10 REGIONAL STATES, TRADE, AND DEVOTIONAL\nRELIGION: INDIA 200 BCE \u2013 300 CE\nAfter the Mauryan Empire fell, no one major power held control over a substantial part of India\nuntil the rise of the Gupta Empire in the fourth century CE. Thus, for five hundred years, from c. 200\nBCE to 300 CE, India saw a fairly rapid turnover of numerous, competing regional monarchies. Most of\nthese were small, while the larger ones were only loosely integrated. Some developed along the Ganges.\nOthers were of Central Asian origins, the product of invasions from the northwest. Also, for the first\ntime, states formed in southern India. Yet, in spite of the political instability, India was economically\ndynamic, as trade within and without the subcontinent flourished, and India was increasingly linked\nto other parts of the world in networks of exchange. And new trends appeared in India\u2019s major\nreligious traditions. A popular,\ndevotional form of worship\nwas added to Buddhism\nand also became a defining\nelement of Hinduism.\n3.10.1 Regional States\nThe general who brought\nthe Mauryan Empire to a close\nby a military coup established\nthe Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 \u2013\n73 BCE). Like its predecessor,\nthis kingdom was centered\non the middle Ganges, the\nheartland of India\u2019s history\nsince the late Vedic Age. But\nMap 3.12 | The Kushan Empire during the reign of King Kanishka\nunlike it, the Shunga King- Author: Thomas Lessman\ndom rapidly dwindled in size.

Used with permission.\nPage | 89 Shunga rulers were constantly warring with neighboring\nkingdoms, and the last fell to an internal coup in 73 CE.\nSubsequently, during the ensuing half millennium, other\nregions of India played equally prominent roles.\nThe northwest remained a source of dynamism, as\ndifferent peoples living beyond the Hindu Kush invaded\nIndia and established one kingdom after another.\nMost of this movement was caused by instability on\nthe steppe lands of Central Asia, where competing\nconfederations of nomadic pastoralists fought for\ncontrol over territory.\nThe most powerful among this succession of states\nwas the Kushan Kingdom, whose origins take us far\naway to the north of China. There, in the second century\nCE, nomadic groups struggling with scarcity moved west,\ndisplacing another group and forcing them into northern\nAfghanistan. Those peoples are known as the Yuezhi\n(yew-eh-jer), and they were made up of several tribes. In\nthe first century CE, a warrior chieftain from one Yuezhi Figure 3.8 | Statue of King Kanishka |\ntribe, the Kushans, united them, invaded northwest Statue of King Kanishka, second century\nCE.

Buddhists, for\ninstance, saw King Kanishka as a great Buddhist\nruler, much like they did King Ashoka. In fact,\nKanishka supported Buddhist scholarship and\nencouraged missionaries to take this faith from\nIndia to Central Asia and China. But his coins\nalso depict Greek, Persian, and Hindu deities,\nMap 3.13 | India in the second and first\nsuggesting that he was open-minded, and\ncentury CE | This map shows the location of the\nShunga (Sunga), Satavahana, and Kushan Empires, perhaps strategic, in matters of religion.\ndemonstrating clearly that India was constituted by After Kanishka\u2019s reign, from the mid-second\nseveral greater and lesser regional powers during\ncentury CE onwards, the empire declined.\nthese centuries.\nAuthor: User \u201cPHG\u201d Like the other, larger Indian states during this\nSource: Wikimedia Commons time, only a core area was ruled directly by the\nLicense: Public Domain\nking\u2019s servants. The other areas were governed\nindirectly by establishing tributary relations with\nlocal rulers. As Kushan power waned, numerous smaller polities emerged, turning northern and\ncentral India into a mosaic of states.\nThe Indian peninsula\u2014the territory south of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Vindhya\nMountain Range\u2014also features more prominently after the fall of the Mauryan Empire. In the\nsouth, kingdoms emerged for the first time. The largest was the Satavahana Kingdom, which\nincluded most of the Deccan Plateau and lasted about three centuries. The first rulers were\nformer Mauryan officials who capitalized on its dissolution, established their own state, and\nexpanded to the north (see Map 3.13). To establish their legitimacy, Satavahana kings embraced\nAryan civilization by allowing Brahmins to perform sacrifices at the court and by upholding the\nvarna social order. They also prospered from a rich agricultural base and trade. However, like\nso many of the larger states during these centuries, this kingdom was only loosely integrated,\nconsisting of small provinces governed by civil and military officers and allied, subordinate\nchieftains and kings.\nPage | 91 3.10.2 Economic Growth and Flourishing Trade Networks\nGold coins discovered in Kushan territory provide much information about the rulers who\nissued them. The Satavahanas also minted coins. Additionally, Roman gold coins have been found\nat over 130 sites in south India. These were issued by Roman emperors at the turn of the Christian\nera, during the first century CE. These coins serve as a sign of the times. Indian monarchs issued\ncoins because trade was growing and intensifying all around them and they wished to support and\nprofit from it. Expanding the money supply facilitated trade and was one way to achieve that goal.\nBoth Indian kingdoms were also geographically well positioned to take advantage of emerging\nglobal trade networks linking the subcontinent to other regions of Afro-Eurasia. This advantage\nprovides one reason why they flourished.\nThe expansion of trade both within and without India is a major theme of these five centuries.\nPut simply, South Asia was a crossroads with much to offer. In market towns and cities across the\nsubcontinent, artisans and merchants organized to produce and distribute a wide variety of goods.\nGuilds were their principal method of organization. A guild was a professional association made\nup of members with a particular trade. Artisan guilds\u2014such as weavers and goldsmiths\u2014set the\nprices and ensured the quality of goods. Operating like and sometimes overlapping with castes,\nguilds also set rules for members and policed their behavior. They acted collectively as proud\nparticipants of urban communities, displaying their banners in festive processions and donating\nmoney to religious institutions. Merchant guilds then saw to it that their artisan products were\ntransported along routes traversing the subcontinent or leading beyond to foreign lands.\nThe lands and peoples surrounding India, and the many empires they lived under, are the\ntopic of later chapters, but we can take a snapshot of the scene here (see Map 3.14). In the first\ncentury CE, India sat amidst\ntrade networks connecting the\nRoman Empire, Persian Empire\n(Parthian), Chinese Empire, and\na host of smaller kingdoms and\nstates in Africa, Central Asia, and\nSoutheast Asia. The major trade\nnetworks were the Silk Roads and\nthe Indian Ocean maritime trade\nroutes. Thus, for example, Greco-\nRoman traders plied the waters\nof the Arabian Sea, bringing ships\nfilled with amphorae and gold\ncoins to ports located along the\nwest coast of India, and returning Map 3.14 | Trade Routes | Some of the major Indian Ocean and\nSilk Road trade routes that linked India to the rest of Afro-Eurasia\nwith spices, textiles, and gems.\nAuthor: User \u201cSplette\u201d\nIndian traders sailed the waters of Source: Wikimedia Commons\nthe Bay of Bengal, bringing cloth License: Public Domain\nPage | 92 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nand beads from the Coromandel Coast to Southeast Asia and returning with cinnamon cloves\nand sandalwood. In the northwest, a similar trade in a variety of goods took place along the Silk\nRoads. Indian traders, for instance, took advantage of the excellent position of the Kushan Empire\nto bring silk from Central Asia to the ports of northwest India, from where it could then be sent\non to Rome. In sum, this vibrant international trade constituted an early stage of globalization.\nCombined with regional trade across the subcontinent, India saw an increase in travel in all\ndirections, even as it remained divided among many regional kingdoms.\n3.10.3 Religious Transformations: Buddhism and Hinduism into the\nCommon Era\nAside from expanding trade, another theme during these centuries of political division is\ntransformations in two of India\u2019s major religions traditions: Buddhism and Hinduism. In both\ncases, new religious ideas and practices were added that emphasized the importance of devotion\nand appealed to broader groups of people.\nBuddhism thrived after the Buddha died in c. 480 BCE, all the more so during this period of\nregional states and the early centuries of the Common Era, at the very moment Christianity was\nspreading through the Roman Empire. In fact, it would not be exaggeration to say that Buddhism\nwas the dominant public religion. The communities of monks and nuns (sangha) that formed after\nBuddha\u2019s time lived in monasteries built along trade routes, near towns, or in caves. To build these\nand survive, the sangha needed much support, which often came in the form of royal patronage.\nKings such as Ashoka and Kanishka, for example, offered lavish support for Buddhist institutions.\nBut over time, the contributions of merchants, women, and people from lower varnas became\njust as important. Unlike Vedic Brahmanism, which privileges the Brahmin varna, Buddhism was\nmore inclusive and less concerned with birth and social class. After all, in theory, anyone could\nbecome a Buddha.\nBuddhism also emphasized the importance of attaining good karma for better rebirths and a\nfuture enlightenment; one didn\u2019t need to be a monk to work at this. Rather, any ordinary layperson,\nregardless of their religious beliefs, could also take Buddhist vows and practice Buddhist ways.\nThat meant not only leading a moral life but also supporting the sangha. By so doing, the good\nkarma of the monks and nuns would be transferred to the community and oneself. This practice\nserved to not only make the world a better place and to ensure a better future, but also to allow\nopportunities for publicly displaying one\u2019s piety. That is why kings, rich merchants, and ordinary\npeople donated to the sangha and gave monks food.\nWith so much support and participation, Buddhism also changed. Every major world religion\nhas different branches. Christianity, for example, has three major ones: the Roman Catholic,\nEastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches. These branches share a common root but diverge in\nsome matters of belief and practice. Buddhism has two major branches: Theravada and Mahayana\nBuddhism. Theravada Buddhism is early Buddhism, the Buddhism of the early sangha, and\nis based on the earliest records of the Buddha\u2019s teaching of the Four Noble Truths. A practitioner\nof this form of Buddhism sought to end suffering and attain nirvana by engaging the Eight-Fold\nPage | 93 Path, a program of study, moral conduct, and meditation. Ideally, the practitioner pursued this\nprogram as a monk or nun in a monastic setting, and eventually became an \u201carhat,\u201d that is, a\nperfected person who is nearly or fully enlightened.\nMahayana Buddhism came later, during the early centuries of the Common Era. Mahayana\nmeans \u201cGreat Vehicle,\u201d pointing to the fact that this form of Buddhism offers multiple paths to\nenlightenment for people from all walks of life. This branch has no single founder and consists of\na set of ideas elaborated upon in new Buddhist scriptures dating to this time. In one of these new\npaths, the Buddha becomes a god who can be worshipped, and by anyone. A monk or lay follower\nis welcome to make an offering before an image of the Buddha placed in a shrine. By so doing, they\ndemonstrate their desire to end suffering and seek salvation through faith in the Buddha.\nFurthermore, with the \u201cGreat Vehicle,\u201d the universe becomes populated with numerous\nBuddhas. Practitioners developed the idea that if anyone can become a Buddha over the\ncourse of many lifetimes of practice, then other Buddhas must exist. Also, the belief arose that\nsome individuals had tread the path to Buddhahood but chose to forego a final enlightenment\nwhere they would leave the world behind so that they could, out of great compassion for all\nsuffering people, work for their deliverance. These holy beings are known as Bodhisattvas, that\nis, enlightened persons who seek nirvana solely out of their desire to benefit all humanity.\nBuddhists also believed that the universe consisted of multiple worlds with multiple heavenly\nrealms. Some of these Buddhas and Bodhisattvas created their own heavenly realms and, from\nthere, offer grace to those seeking salvation through them. Through veneration and worship,\nthe follower hopes to be reborn in that heavenly realm, where they can then finish the path to\nliberation. Seeking to become a Bodhisattva through a path of devotion was one of the new paths\noutlined by Mahayana scriptures.\nBuddhism traveled out of India and had an impact on other parts of the world, making it\na major world religion. This expansion resulted from the efforts of Buddhist missionaries and\nmerchants, as well as kings who supported its propagation. Theravada Buddhism was carried to\nSri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia, where it remains a dominant religious tradition. Mahayana\nBuddhism spread to Central and East Asia, a process that was facilitated by the Silk Road and\nthe support of kings like Kanishka of the Kushan Empire (see Map 3.15). However, Buddhism\neventually declined in India, especially after the first millennium BCE. From that time, Hinduism\nand Islam increasingly won over the religious imagination of the peoples of India, with royal\npatronage and lay support following.\nHinduism also saw new developments during this period and throughout the first millennium\nCE. In fact, many scholars see these centuries as the time during which Hinduism first took shape\nand prefer using the term Vedic Brahmanism for the prior history of this religious tradition.\nVedic Brahmanism was the sacrifice-centered religion of the Vedas where, in exchange for gifts,\nBrahmins performed rituals for kings and householders in order to ensure the favor of the gods.\nIt also included the speculative world of the Upanishads, where renunciants went out in search of\nspiritual liberation.\nBut something important happened during these later centuries. An additional religious\nliterature was compiled and shrines and temples with images of deities were constructed, pointing\nPage | 94 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nMap 3.15 | The spread of Buddhism from India to other regions of Asia | Green arrows indicate the\npathway for the spread of Theravada Buddhism, from India (including Sri Lanka) to Southeast Asia. The red arrows\nindicate the routes for the spread of Mahayana Buddhism to East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan).\nAuthor: Gunawan Kartapranata\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nto the emergence of new, popular forms of devotion and an effort to define a good life and society\naccording to the idea of dharma. With this transition, we can speak more formally of Hinduism.\nOne important set of texts is the Dharma Scriptures, ethical and legal works whose\nauthority derived from their attribution to ancient sages. Dharma means \u201cduty\u201d or proper human\nconduct and so, true to their title, these scriptures define the rules each person must follow in\norder to lead a righteous and devout life and contribute to a good society. Most importantly,\nPage | 95 these rules were determined by the\nrole assigned to an individual by the\nvarna system of social classes, the\ncaste system, and gender. For example,\nfor a male, dharma meant following\nthe rules for their caste and varna\nwhile passing through four stages in\nlife: student, householder, hermit, and\nrenunciant. In his youth, a man must\nstudy to prepare for his occupation\nand, as a householder, he must support\nhis family and contribute to society.\nLate in life, after achieving these goals,\nhe should renounce material desires\nFigure 3.10 | An early Hindu temple in Deogarh, India |\nand withdraw from society, first living This temple was erected to worship Vishnu during the Gupta\nas a hermit on the margins of society period, c. 500 CE. Ruins from earlier temples dating to the\nperiod 200 BCE-300 CE are not well preserved.\nand then as a wandering renunciant\nAuthor: Byron Aihara\nwhose sole devotion is to god. Source: Wikimedia Commons\nA woman\u2019s roles, on the other hand, License: CC BY-SA 2.0\nwere defined as obedience to her father\nin youth and faithful service to her husband as an adult. For this reason, historians see a trend\nin ancient Indian history whereby women became increasingly subservient and subordinate.\nAlthough women were to be honored and supported, the ideal society and family were defined in\npatriarchal terms. That meant men dominated public life, were the authority figures at home, and\nusually inherited the property. Also, women were increasingly expected to marry at a very young\nage\u2014even prior to puberty\u2014and to remain celibate as widows. In later centuries, some widows\neven observed the practice of burning themselves upon the funeral pyre of the deceased husband.\nFamous Indian epics also illustrated the theme of duty. The Ramayana (\u201cRama\u2019s Journey\u201d)\ntells the story of Prince Rama and his wife Sita. Rama\u2019s parents\u2014the king and queen\u2014wished for\nhim to take the throne, but a second queen plotted against him and forced him into exile for years.\nSita accompanied him, but was abducted by a demon-king, leading to a battle in consequence. With\nthe help of a loyal monkey god, Rama defeated the demon, recovered his wife, and returned with\nher to his father\u2019s kingdom, where they were crowned king and queen. In brief, throughout this\nlong story, Rama exemplified the virtues of a king and Sita exemplified the virtues of a daughter\nand wife. They both followed their dharma.\nA similar theme dominates the Bhagavad-Gita (\u201cSong of the Lord\u201d). This classic of Hindu\nscripture is included as a chapter in another Indian epic, the Mahabharata (The Great Bharata).\nIt tells of wars between cousins who are fighting over the title to their kingdom\u2019s throne. As a\nbattle was poised to commence, one of these cousins\u2014Prince Arjuna\u2014threw down his weapons\nand refused to fight because he did not wish to harm his kinsmen. But Krishna, his mentor and\ncharioteer, delivered a speech on the nature of duty for a warrior like himself, one that illustrated\nPage | 96 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nthe religious basis for observing\ndharma. Arjuna was thus moved\nto action.\nReligious texts and temples\nalso signal the rise of a powerful\ndevotional Hinduism centered\nupon a few supreme deities.\nStone temples were erected\nfor the purpose of housing\nrepresentations of a god or\ngoddess (see Figure 3.10).\nPeoples of all classes could go\nto the temple to view the deity,\nFigure 3.11 | Relief of Shiva and his wife Parvati in a rock-cut pray, and offer fruits and flowers.\nHindu cave-temple (c. 800) | This relief also dates to a later age but By so doing, they showed their\nwell captures traditions of iconic representations of Hindu deities dating\nlove for this lord and their desire\nback to the early centuries CE.\nAuthor: User \u201cQuartierLatin1968\u201d to be saved by his or her grace.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons The most popular deities were\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nShiva and Vishnu.\nGrowing up, devotees of\nthese supreme deities would hear countless myths and legends about their origins, exploits, and\npowers from Brahmins at the temples or story-tellers in their hometown. Vishnu preserves the\nuniverse and watches over it; in times of unbridled evil, he assumes the form of an avatar to\nremove it and return the world to righteousness. King Rama of the Ramayana and Krishna of\nthe Bhagavad-Gita are in fact two such incarnations of Vishnu. Shiva is both benevolent and\nprotective but also destroys all things. Whereas Vishnu preserves the universe, Shiva destroys\nit at the end of a cycle. A third deity, Brahma, then recreates it. Combined, this Hindu trinity\u2014\nBrahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer\u2014represent different facets of\nthe one divine reality behind the great cosmic cycles and also life and death. They each have female\ncounterparts. Shiva\u2019s wife Parvati, for instance, is a goddess of love and devotion (see Figure 3.11).\nIn sum, during this period and the first millennium CE, several elements come together to\nmake up the religion outsiders later labeled Hinduism. These elements include the sacrificial\nreligion of the Brahmins, the renunciants\u2019 spiritual pursuit of Self and divine reality (atman and\nbrahman), a social order shaped by the varna and caste system, notions of law and duty embodied\nin each individual\u2019s dharma, and devotion to supreme deities and their avatars. Hinduism thus\nthoroughly shaped the social and spiritual life of the peoples of India and of Indian society.\nTherefore, the rulers of ancient India supported the Brahmins, built temples, upheld the varna\nsystem, and assumed titles declaring their devotion to the supreme deities. Hinduism became\npart of the king\u2019s dharma, and fulfilling that dharma brought the approval of his subjects.\nPage | 97 3.11 THE GUPTA EMPIRE\nAND INDIA\u2019S CLASSICAL\nAGE (300 \u2013 600 CE)\nThe pattern of regional states\ncharacteristic of post-Mauryan times and\nthe early centuries of the Common Era\nwill persist in India until the sixteenth\ncentury. At any one time, India had many\nkings. But on occasion, one king might\nforge a substantial regional power and\nassume grand titles that elevated him\nover others. The political scene, therefore,\nconsisted of not only a mosaic of royal\npowers but also a political hierarchy.\nSome rulers held power over others,\nmaking for a pattern of paramountcy and\nsubordination among kings and princes\nof many different dynasties across the\nland. These paramount powers could\nMap 3.16 | The Gupta Empire in the third and fourth\nthen take advantage of the stability they\ncenturies CE | Most territorial expansion occurred during\nestablished and the wealth they accrued to the reign of Samudragupta, although many local rulers\npatronize the arts and promote a cultural were left in place as subordinate kings.\nAuthor: User \u201cJavierfv1212\u201d\nrenaissance. The Gupta Empire is the\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\npre-eminent example of such a power License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nduring the period 300 \u2013 600 CE; indeed,\nsome historians see the time during which they dominated northern India as a classical age.\nAs is the case for so much of India\u2019s ancient political history, details concerning Gupta\nrulers have been reconstructed largely from coins, inscriptions, and seals. The dynasty begins in\nobscurity with two kings of a minor state located along the Ganges River, but then explodes on\nthe scene with the next two kings: Chandragupta I (c. 320 \u2013 335) and his son Samudragupta\n(c. 335 \u2013 375). Through conquest and marital alliances, Chandragupta I forged a larger empire in\nthe old Ganges heartland (see Map 3.16). A gold coin provides some of the evidence detailing the\nGupta Empire. This coin displays Chandragupta standing next to a certain Queen Kumaradevi.\nHe has taken the title \u201cGreat King of Kings,\u201d which signifies imperial power, while she is identified\nas the princess of a powerful neighboring kingdom (see Figure 3.12).\nDuring his forty-year reign, Samudragupta made the empire great, a feat most forcefully\nevidenced by a royal eulogy inscribed on one of the old edict pillars of King Ashoka. This eulogy,\nwhich describes Samudragupta as \u201cconqueror of the four corners of the earth,\u201d tells of how\nhe subdued dozens of kings across the subcontinent. Closer to home, along the Ganges, many\nPage | 98 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nrulers were slain and their territory was annexed,\nwhile farther out across northern India and to the\nsoutheast, others were \u201ccaptured and liberated.\u201d\nThese captured and liberated kings were recognized\nas \u201cservants,\u201d which meant they could continue\nto rule their own lands as subordinates, on the\ncondition that they paid tribute and homage. Gupta\nrulers thus directly administered a core territory\nalong the Ganges River while adopting a model of\ntributary overlordship for the rest. The Gupta\nimperial court in effect presided over a society of\ntributary rulers.\nAfter Samudragupta\u2019s time, two more Gupta\nrulers enjoyed long reigns of forty years, with the\nempire reaching a peak of power and prosperity.\nFigure 3.12 | Gupta period coin depicting\nBut in the sixth century, decline set in.

Again, the Gupta era is\noften labeled as a classical age for India. A\nperiod in the history of a civilization\u2019s being\nlabeled as classical generally means it was a\ntime of artistic and intellectual excellence,\nwith its having attained standard-setting\nFigure 3.13 | Gupta Period Buddhist sculpture\n(fifth century) showing the seated Buddha giving achievements in a number of fields. Classical\na sermon also suggests a certain level of maturation for a\nAuthor: User \u201cTevaprapas\u201d\ncivilization. It should be noted, however, that\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 some scholars question the use of this term\nPage | 99 because all ages produce great works, and sometimes choosing one period as classical simply\nrepresents the biased judgment of a later time.\nYet, during the Gupta era, India did produce important scientific discoveries and works of\nart and literature. The exquisite sculptures of the Buddha portraying his serene enlightenment\nand teaching were the epitome of the classical achievement in art (see Figure 3.13). India also\nsaw an outpouring of literary masterpieces. Kalidasa is one of India\u2019s greatest Sanskrit poets\nand playwrights. His play The Recognition of Shakuntala, a world masterpiece, tells the story\nof a girl who lived in a hermitage in the countryside after being abandoned by her parents. One\nday, a king was out hunting and chanced upon her. They fell in love and married. But then he\nhurried back to his palace and when she later came to him he no longer knew her because he\nhad been cursed. The only solution for her dilemma was for her to present a ring he had left her.\nUnfortunately, it had slipped off her finger. The play tells of how this love story concluded, along\nwith the involvement of many higher powers.\nIn the field of medicine, Ayurveda matured as more complete editions of ancient medical\ntexts were compiled. Ayurveda (meaning \u201cknowledge for longevity\u201d) is India\u2019s ancient medical\nscience. It provides a systematic effort to explain the origins of diseases in dislocations of bodily\nhumors (substances) and to prescribe cures for them. India also saw advancements in the\nfields of astronomy and mathematics. Aryabhata (476 \u2013 550 CE), for instance, was the first\nastronomer to propose that the earth rotated on an axis and a scientific explanation for eclipses.\nHe calculated pi to 3.1416 and the solar year to 364.3586805 days. His work demonstrates the\ncontemporary use of a sophisticated system of decimal notation, which was also an ancient\nIndian discovery.\n3.12 INDIA\u2019S EARLY MEDIEVAL AGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT\nOF ISLAMIC STATES IN INDIA, 600 \u2013 1300\nThe history of ancient India concludes with the decline of the Gupta Empire. The next major\nperiod, which lasts for roughly seven centuries (c. 600 \u2013 1300), is the early medieval age. During\nthese centuries, kingdoms in both the north and south proliferated and regularly turned over.\nTherefore, at any one time, India was fragmented by numerous regional kingdoms. As the rulers of\nthese warred and formed alliances, they employed the system of paramountcy and subordination\nbegun during the Gupta era, with some rulers being overlords and others vassals. Also, successful\nrulers demonstrated their power by granting land to officers, Brahmins, and temples. The outcome\nwas a political pattern labeled Indian feudalism.\nThese rulers also demonstrated their power\u2014and enhanced it\u2014by patronizing Hindu institutions\nand developing local traditions in the regions where their courts resided. They adopted titles showing\ntheir devotion to the great Hindu deities, declared their intent to uphold dharma, built fabulous\nHindu temples in urban centers, and charged Brahmins with attending to them and serving at their\ncourts. One outstanding example of a feudal kingdom is the Chola Kingdom of southern India.\nLastly, at the end of this age, a new force appeared on the Indian scene. Muslim Arab and\nTurkic rulers of West and Central Asia made incursions into the subcontinent. Along with Arab\nPage | 100 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\ntraders arriving on India\u2019s west coast for trade, they brought a new religion and type of rule to the\nlandscape of early medieval India and forged new connections between the subcontinent and the\nrest of Afro-Eurasia.\n3.12.1 Indian Feudalism\nFeudalism is a term historians first used to describe the political, social, and economic system\nof the European Middle Ages (see Chapter Twelve). That system was the world of lords, vassal\nknights, and serfs characteristic of Europe from the tenth to thirteenth centuries. In exchange\nfor homage and military service, vassals received land from their lords. These lands became their\nmanors, and serfs worked them. The lords and their vassals constituted a privileged nobility,\nwhile the serfs lived in a state of servitude.\nHistorians also use feudalism to describe India during the early medieval age. But the\nusefulness of this term is much debated, because conditions on the ground varied from place\nto place, not only in Europe but also in India. Therefore, historians now only use the term in a\ngeneral sense while also describing specific variations. In general, feudalism designates a political\nand economic scene characterized by fragmented authority, a set of obligations between lords\nand vassals, and grants of land (including those who work it) by rulers in exchange for some kind\nof service.\nAuthority on the early medieval Indian subcontinent was indeed fragmented, not only by\nthe many regional kingdoms that existed at any one time but also, more importantly, within\nkingdoms. Because kingdoms incessantly warred with one another, their boundaries were fluid.\nRulers usually closely administered a core area near the capital with a civil administration,\nwhile granting feudatories on the periphery. Having defeated the ruling lineage of a powerful\nneighboring state\u2014such as a king, prince, or chief, victorious kings might allow them to retain\nnoble titles and their lands, on the condition that they demonstrate allegiance to him and even\nsupply tribute and military service. The overlord could then wield the title \u201cGreat King of Kings,\u201d\nwhile the lesser rulers bore titles signifying their status as subordinate rulers who do obeisance.\nAdditionally, aside from granting these feudatories, medieval rulers also issued land grants to\nimportant persons and institutions in their realms, such as Brahmins, high officials, or temples. As\nopposed to receiving a cash salary, these recipients were permitted to retain revenue from villages\non this land, as well as to exercise some level of judicial authority. Brahmins were so important to\nkings because they aided him in upholding the king\u2019s dharma. The king\u2019s duty was to protect the\npeople, uphold the varna social order, sacrifice to the traditional Vedic deities, and show devotion\nto Shiva or Vishnu. As the religious leaders and intellectuals in the community, and the most\nprestigious varna, Brahmins could craft genealogies proving a king\u2019s illustrious origins in the\nheroic lineages of the epic stories of ancient times, perform the sacrifices, and maintain temples.\nSo rulers often generously gifted land to them or to the magnificent temple complexes rulers built.\nMedieval India, then, consisted of a multitude of kingdoms, each of which governed a part\nof their realms through feudal arrangements, by granting feudatories and issuing land grants to\nnobility or prestigious religious and political leaders, in exchange for allegiance and assisting the\nPage | 101 ruler in demonstrating his being worthy of his sacred role. In most instances, given that society\nwas patriarchal, rulers were male, but in many cases queens inherited the throne. Rudramadevi,\nfor instance, was chosen by her father\nto accede to the throne of a kingdom\nin central India, likely because he had\nno sons or living brothers. Inscriptions\nrefer to her as a king; indeed, she is\nsaid to have donned male attire while\nleading soldiers into battle. She is\nalso portrayed seated on a lion, with a\ndagger and shield in hand. Thus, she\nwas conformed to the expected role of a\nwarrior, male king. Clearly, preserving\nthe dynastic line was more important\nthan biological sex.\n3.12.2 The Chola Dynasty\nThe Chola Kingdom illustrates\nwell the grandeur of powerful regional\nstates during the early medieval period.\nSouth India first came to prominence Map 3.17 | The Chola Kingdom during the reign of\nRajaraja I (r. 985-1012) | The Brihadeshwara Temple was\nwith the rise of the Satavahana\nlocated in Tanjavur, the capital.\nKingdom in the Deccan Plateau (c.

But even at Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nthat time, in the fertile hinterlands and\nalong the seaboard of the southern tip\nof the subcontinent, Tamil states were forming. Tamil refers to the regional language spoken and\nwritten by Indian peoples of the far south, as well as to their local customs and culture. Powerful\nTamil lineages divided up Tamil land among chiefdoms, and, over time, some evolved into small\nbut impressive kingdoms. These Tamil states also adopted elements of the Aryan culture of the\nnorth, including the use of Sanskrit, the varna social system, Vedic Brahmanism, and the Hindu\ncults of Shiva and Vishnu.\nThe Cholas, for instance, date back to Satavahana times, but they don\u2019t become significant\nfor India\u2019s political history until the ninth century CE, when they show up as a feudatory of a\nneighboring Tamil kingdom. Beginning with King Aditya I (r. 871 \u2013 907), the Cholas began a process\nof expansion that would eventually make it the most powerful kingdom of the south up until the\nthirteenth century (see Map 3.17). Two of the most powerful Chola rulers were Rajaraja I (r. 985 \u2013\n1012) and his son Rajendra I (1012 \u2013 1044). During their reigns, most of south India was conquered,\nincluding Sri Lanka, and a royal administration was built. Chola kings directly administered a\ncore area of provinces and districts with royal officials, but also granted feudatories to allegiant\nPage | 102 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nchieftains and land grants to\nBrahmins. At the local level,\nthese authorities worked\nwith village assemblies and\ntown associations, both of\nwhich were remarkable for\nthe level of freedom they had\nto manage local affairs.\nThe Chola kings proved\ntheir greatness through not\nonly the success of their im-\nperial ambitions but also the\ntemples they built. These\ntemples, some of the most\nimpressive structures in In-\ndia, testify to the kings\u2019 piety.\nEulogies to Chola kings de- Figure 3.14 | Brihadeshwara Temple | The temple was located in the\nChola capital and dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.\nscribe them not only as great\nAuthor: User \u201cNirinsanity\u201d\nwarriors and conquerors Source: Wikimedia Commons\nbut also as protectors of the License: CC BY-SA 4.0\ndharma, destroyers of evil,\nand generous givers of gifts. Because they were built in honor of the great Hindu deities, temples\nput those latter qualities on display. In 1010 CE, Rajaraja I completed the Brihadeshwara Temple\nin Tanjavur, the Chola capital and ceremonial center (see Figure 3.14). Atop the main sanctuary\nstands a sixty-two meter tall tower carved out of a block of granite weighing eighty-one tons. Nu-\nmerous representations portray the supreme lord Shiva in his various manifestations, including\none located in the inner sanctuary. On the profusely ornamented tower, Shiva appears repeatedly\nin his form as destroyer of the cities of demons. Clearly, Rajaraja I wished to raise the cult of Shiva\nto a pre-eminent position in his kingdom, and built this temple to project Chola power.\nLike other great regional powers with their unique histories and architectural traditions during\nthe early medieval period, the Chola kingdom peaked for about two centuries and then declined.\nIn the thirteenth century, neighboring kingdoms nibbled away at its power and it came to an end.\n3.12.3 The Rise of Islamic States in North India\nOne of the most important developments during India\u2019s early medieval age is the arrival\nof Muslim Arab and Turkic traders and conquerors and the eventual establishment of Islamic\nstates and communities in India. This story begins with the life of Muhammad (570 \u2013 632 CE),\nthe Prophet of Islam, whose revelations were recorded in the Quran (see Chapter 8). During his\nlifetime and after, an Arab community and state governed by the principles of Islam were founded\nin Arabia. Over the course of the seventh and eighth centuries, this Arab Islamic state grew into\nPage | 103 an empire that included much of West Asia and North Africa. This size meant that many different\nethnic groups\u2014Egyptians, Persians, and Turks, for instance\u2014fell under its governing umbrella.\nThe ruler of this empire was the caliph, a man designated political successor to Muhammad,\nas the leader of the Islamic community. The caliph\u2019s government is called the caliphate. The first\ncaliphs were friends and relatives of Muhammad, but eventually long-lasting dynasties formed\nthat made the position hereditary. The first was the Umayyad Dynasty (661 \u2013 750 CE) and the\nsecond the Abbasid Dynasty (750 \u2013 1258 CE). It was during these caliphates that Islam and\nIslamic rule made their way into India.\nMap 3.18 | Islamic Expansion 630-750\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nDuring the Umayyad Caliphate, systematic reconnaissance of the northwest coast of India was\nundertaken because conquests brought the empire just to the west of the Indian subcontinent.\nWhen pirates plundered an Arab vessel at the mouth of the Indus River, the caliph authorized\npunitive measures, and Umayyad rulers sent an invasion force. In 711, the Sindh (the lower Indus)\nwas seized from a Hindu ruler and incorporated into the Islamic Empire. An Islamic community\nthen began to set roots in this part of India.\nPage | 104 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nThe Umayyad Caliphate ruled from 661 \u2013 750 CE. Note the inclusion of part of northwest\nIndia, near the Indus River. The next major event didn\u2019t transpire until the tenth century, at a\ntime when Turkic peoples had become important to the history of Islamic states in India. By this\ntime, the Abbasid Dynasty had replaced the Umayyad as the caliphs of the Islamic Empire. One\nmethod Abbasid rulers used to govern their large realm was to employ enslaved Turks as soldiers\nand administrators. Today, the word Turkic might normally be associated with the country of\nTurkey, but in fact Turkic peoples and their language family\u2014Turkish\u2014originated in Central Asia.\nThat is where the expanding Islamic empire first encountered and began incorporating Turks into\ntheir governing.\nThe significance of these Turkic slave soldiers for India is that the Abbasids employed them as\ngovernors of the eastern end of their empire. This end included parts of Afghanistan, the neighbor\nto northwest India. In the tenth century, however, the caliphate was falling apart, and Turkic\nmilitary governors took advantage of this dissolution by establishing an independent state in\nAfghanistan. The family that did so was the Ghaznavids. Ruling from a fortress in Ghazna, the\nGhaznavids forged an empire that included much of Iran and northwest India (see Map 3.19).\nMap 3.19 | The Ghaznavid Empire at its height | The capital was located in Afghanistan, at Ghazna.\nAuthor: Arab League\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 105 The Ghaznavid ruler who first made forays into India was Mahmud of Ghazna (971 \u2013 1030). In\nsome historical writing, Mahmud has been portrayed as a brutal plunderer who descended on India\nseventeen times with hordes of Turkic cavalry, shocking wealthy cities of the north with the sword of\nIslam by destroying their Hindu temples and returning to his capital with their stolen wealth.\nBut the reality may have been otherwise. Recent work suggests that Mahmud was neither\ninterested in spreading Islam nor caused massive destruction. Rather, northwestern India had\nalways been closely linked to Central Asia, as well as being the location of both repeated invasions\nand kingdoms that crossed over into the mountains. Furthermore, by the tenth century, Muslim\ncommunities had already become a part of the Indian scene, along the west coast and in this\nregion. Therefore, Mahmud\u2019s incursions were hardly something new. Nor were his motives.\nIn medieval India, kings often waged war not only for revenue but also because such was their\ncustom. Mahmud was likely no different. His empire was experiencing instability; he therefore\nsought to prove his mettle as a warrior ruler and to secure his legacy by using Indian wealth to\nbuild palaces and mosques in Ghazna.\nGhaznavid control over India didn\u2019t extend much beyond the Punjab, lasting less than two\ncenturies. In 1186, Muhammad of Ghur\u2014chieftain of a minor hill state in Afghanistan that was\nsubordinate to the Ghaznavids\u2014overthrew his overlords in Ghazna and proceeded to forge his\nown empire. Desiring to extend it across northern India, he found that his greatest foes were the\nRajputs. The Rajputs were clans located in northern and central India that claimed descent from\nrenowned Kshatriya (warrior) lineages of ancient times. While Muhammad of Ghuri was planning\nhis military expeditions, the Rajputs were governing several regional Hindu kingdoms from large\nfortresses they had built. In 1192, Muhammad\u2019s forces defeated a confederation of Rajput rulers at\nthe Battle of Tarain. His slave general and commander-in-chief, Qutb-ud-din Aybak, then achieved\na string of victories across northern India, making it a part of the Ghurid Empire.\nMuhammad of Ghur returned to his Afghan homeland, leaving northern India to Aybak, who\nthen proceeded to set up his headquarters in Delhi, one of the most important cities in South Asia,\nand also the capital of today\u2019s nation of India. When Muhammad died in 1206, Aybak took control\nof these Indian possessions and established a state of his own called the Delhi Sultanate (see\nmap 3.20). A sultanate is the government of a sultan, and a sultan is an Islamic ruler who governs\na country largely independently of the caliphs, but without claiming their title. The Delhi sultans,\nthen, were the sovereign rulers of the first major Muslim state in India, one that would last for\nthree hundred years.\nLooking ahead to our own time, the nation of India today is both culturally and religiously\ndiverse. Approximately 80% of the population practices Hinduism while 15% practices Islam,\nmaking these the two largest religious traditions in India today. For this reason, relations between\npeoples adhering to these two different faiths have been an important issue in the history of South\nAsia. As we have seen, the history of Islam and Islamic communities in the subcontinent begins\nduring the early medieval period. Therefore, historians pay close attention to how Delhi sultans\ngoverned an overwhelmingly Hindu population, as well as how Islamic communities fit into it.\nRuling as they were over an ancient and vast agrarian civilization, the Turkic sultans worked\nout an accommodation with India, adapting to the pattern of Indian feudalism. Outside the highest\nPage | 106 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nMap 3.20 | Map of the Delhi Sultanate | Map of the Delhi Sultanate, showing territorial changes over the course\nof three centuries and a series of ruling dynasties and their most important rulers.\nAuthor: User \u201cJavierfv1212\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nlevels of government, Hindu society and its traditional leaders were largely left in place, so long\nas tax revenue was submitted. With a long history of conquest behind them, Islamic rulers had\nlearned the benefits of adopting a pragmatic approach to non-Muslims, and these sultans were no\nexception. They had little interest in forcibly converting people to the faith, and rather adopted\na principle from the Quran whereby non-Muslim peoples with a scriptural tradition of their own\ncan live amidst the Islamic community and state so long as they pay a higher tax. At the highest\nlevels, however, sultans placed Turkic military nobility and educated Persians in charge, often\ncompensating them with land grants. In fact, because Persians became so important to Sultanate\nadministration, Persian was adopted as the language of government.\nThis Muslim ruling elite attempted to retain their Turkic and Persian traditions, but also\nslowly adopted Indian customs in what was generally a tolerant atmosphere. At the lower levels\nof society, Muslim traders and artisans became an important presence in Indian towns and cities,\nas did Indian converts who saw an advantage to converting to this faith. Thus, Hindu and Muslim\ncommunities increasingly interacted with each other during the early medieval age, adopting\nelements of each other\u2019s way of life. For that reason, historians speak of a fusion of Islamic and\nIndian culture.\n3.13 CONCLUSION\nWe have now passed through the long course of India\u2019s ancient and early medieval history.\nWe began with the onset of India\u2019s Neolithic period in the seventh millennium BCE and saw how\nPage | 107 India\u2019s first civilization\u2014the Harappan Civilization (2600 \u2013 1700 BCE)\u2014emerged from it in the\nnorthwestern region of the subcontinent during the third millennium BCE.\nWe then examined the long course of the Vedic Age (1700 \u2013 600 BCE). As Harappan\nCivilization declined, Indo-Aryans migrated from Central Asia into northern India, bringing\nwith them their Vedic religion, Sanskrit language, and pastoral and farming way of life. As they\nsettled down on the Indo-Gangetic Plains and interacted with indigenous peoples, new political,\nsocial, and religious institutions formed. Over the course of several centuries, Aryan clan and\ntribal organization developed into kingdoms and oligarchies. Also, a simpler society composed of\npriests, warriors, and commoners evolved into a more complex society organized by varnas, the\nsystem of four hereditary social classes. Finally, the Vedic religion of the Brahmin priests evolved\ninto Brahmanism, the earliest stage in the development of Hinduism.\nNext, we surveyed a transitional period in India\u2019s history that began in the sixth century\nand lasted until 321 BCE. Sixteen major kingdoms and oligarchies with roots in the late Vedic\nAge fought for control over territory in northern India. The kingdom of Magadha dominated.\nAccompanying this time of warring states, India entered a second stage of urbanization, as towns\nand cities became a prominent feature of the north. Alongside the varnas, the caste system began\nto form, organizing Indian society into a much larger number of social groups based on occupation,\nresidence, language, and religious beliefs. Lastly, new religious ideas were put forward by the\nBuddha (c. 563 \u2013 480 BCE) to challenge the dominance of Brahmanism, and Buddhist monastic\ncommunities began to form.\nThis transitional period ended when Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the last Magadhan\ndynasty in 321 BCE and established the Mauryan Empire (321 \u2013 184 BCE). He and his successors\nbuilt the first Indian state that included most of the subcontinent. Chandragupta\u2019s grandson,\nKing Ashoka (r. 268 \u2013 232), is famed for having tried to rule this large realm according to\nBuddhist principles.\nWe then saw how, for five centuries after the fall of the Mauryan Empire (c. 200 BCE \u2013 300\nCE), no one major power ruled India. The entire subcontinent saw instead a fairly rapid turnover\nof regional monarchies. Some developed along the Ganges River, while others, such as the Kushan\nKingdom, were of Central Asian origins. Also, states such as the Satavahana Kingdom formed in\nsouthern India. Yet, in spite of the political instability, India was economically dynamic, as trade\nwithin and without the subcontinent flourished, and India was increasingly linked to other parts\nof the world in such networks of exchange as the Silk Road and Indian Ocean maritime trade.\nLastly, new trends appeared in Buddhism and Hinduism, most notably a popular, devotional\nform of worship.\nAlthough India remained a mosaic of states during the period 300 \u2013 600 BCE, historians\nrecognize this time as distinct because the Gupta Empire (320 \u2013 550 CE) included much of\nnorthern India and facets of Gupta period society and culture suggest that Indian civilization had\nmatured and entered a classical age. One facet was individual achievements in literature, the arts,\nand sciences. But equally as important, the lives of all members of society were now being shaped\nand given meaning by a political pattern, social institutions, religious traditions, and a culture\nwith a deep history. That political pattern included, for example, notions of kingship and the\nPage | 108 CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA\nking\u2019s dharma, as well as political hierarchy. Social institutions included the patriarchal family,\nvarna and caste, and commercial associations in cities and towns. As for religious traditions, we\nhave focused on the development of Hinduism and Buddhism and how they shaped the religious\nlandscape with their long literary and scriptural traditions, notions of dharma, and monastic and\ntemple life.\nWe ended this chapter by introducing early medieval India (c. 600 \u2013 1300 BCE). The political\nscene remained one of powerful regional states, each with their unique local histories and traditions.\nThe methods by which kings established relations with neighboring rulers and within their own\nlands has been described as Indian feudalism. Some kings, like the Cholas, buttressed their power\nby claiming to rule according to Hindu notions of dharma, by, for instance, building large Hindu\ntemples and patronizing the Brahmins. Finally, during these centuries, Islamic rule, communities,\nand religion entered the South Asian landscape, changing the course of India\u2019s history.\n3.14 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nAli, Daud.

Little\ndid they know, they had chanced\nupon what has turned out to be\none of the most fascinating ar-\nchaeological discoveries of the\ntwentieth century. Subsequent\nexcavation revealed that be-\nneath the fragment lay a mas-\nsive underground pit filled with\nover seven thousand terracot-\nta figurines modeling archers,\ninfantrymen, and charioteers.\nAnother pit contained terra-\ncotta cavalry and infantry units Figure 4.1 | Terracotta Soldiers | Excavated underground pit of the First\nthat likely composed a military Emperor of Qin, showing assembled infantry and horses pulling chariots.\nAuthor: Aneta Ribarska\nguard, while a third one con-\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\ntained high ranking officers License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nand war chariots in what was\nperhaps a command post. These three pits are part of a much larger complex of underground vaults\nspread across twenty-two square miles. Most importantly, a large, forested burial mound towers over\nthe neighboring fields containing these underground armies. This is where the First Emperor of Qin\n[cheen] was buried after he died in 210 BCE. Although it hasn\u2019t yet been excavated, experts believe the\ntomb is a microcosm of the emperor\u2019s palace, capital city, and empire. The pits, then, contained the\nPage | 112 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\narmy protecting his realm in the afterlife. With this discovery, our understanding of how China was\nunified under one empire after a long period of warfare was advanced immeasurably.\nEast Asia can be defined in two different ways. Geographically speaking, it can be defined\nas the eastern region of the Asian continent and the countries located there, principally China,\nNorth and South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. But historians also define East Asia as a broader\ncultural realm, and include countries that both shared close historical relations with China and\nwere impacted by China\u2019s political and legal institutions, and Confucian and Buddhist traditions.\nWhen defined in this way, Vietnam is also included. This chapter, however, as an introduction to\nthe early history of East Asia, will focus on China, Korea, and Japan.\n4.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

In earlier times,\nthe bulk of the Chinese population lived in China proper, by which we mean the historical\nheartland of ancient China (see Map 4.1). To the east, China proper is bounded by the Yellow Sea,\nPage | 114 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nEast China Sea, and South China Sea.\nTo the south, it is bordered by the\nmountainous jungles of Southeast\nAsia. To the west and north, China\nis rimmed by a transitional frontier\nzone where land suited to agriculture\ngives way to mountains and plateau\nor vast expanses of steppe grasslands\nand desert. At times, the dynasties\nof China became actively involved\nin all of these neighboring areas,\nincorporating them directly into\ntheir expanding empires or indirectly\nas subordinate, tribute-paying states.\nThose areas include parts of the\nKorean Peninsula, Northeast China,\nMongolia, Central Asia, and Vietnam.\nWithin China proper, two rivers\nwere particularly important to the\nMap 4.1 | East Asia\nformation of agricultural commu-\nAuthor: Larry Israel\nnities that served as the building Source: Original Work\nblocks of Chinese civilization. Those License: CC BY-SA 4.0\nwere the Yellow River and Yangzi\nRiver. The Yellow River meanders through the northern half of China, where a cool, dry climate\nis well-suited to wheat and millet farming. Beginning far to the west, this river meanders over\ndusty plateau, becomes muddied with silt, and then deposits this sediment along its middle and\nlower reaches. The plains surrounding these reaches are collectively referred to as the North\nChina Plain. Historically, this was the heartland of Chinese civilization. However, the Yangzi\nRiver was just as important. Located in south China where the weather is relatively warmer and\nwetter, its long basin provided fertile soil for rice-paddy agriculture. Over time, the early dynasties\nexpanded into and included the settled agricultural communities in this region.\nJapan is an island country consisting of four main islands and many smaller ones located off\nthe Pacific coast of the Asian continent. At 400,000 square kilometers, Japan is slightly smaller\nthan California, although the terrain is more rugged. Because Japan is covered by mountains and\ntraversed by numerous rivers, only fifteen percent of the land is suited to agriculture. Much of\nthat was concentrated in two plains\u2013the Kinai Plain and Kanto Plain\u2013making them particularly\nimportant to Japan\u2019s early history. Japan is also located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, where\ntectonic plates composing the earth\u2019s crust frequently move and collide. That is why earthquakes\nand volcanic activity have been a constant threat to populations living on these islands.\nThe Korean Peninsula is the location of North and South Korea today. Prior to the twentieth\ncentury, however, it saw a long succession of Korean kingdoms. Extending roughly 1100 kilometers\nPage | 115 southward from the Asian landmass, the peninsula is bounded by seas to the east, west, and south,\nand defined by the Yalu River to the north. Beyond that lies Northeast China which was only\nperiodically included in the territory of Chinese empires. Consequently, because the peninsula lies\nbetween China to the north and west and Japan to the east, Korean dynasties have been deeply\nimpacted by these states\u2019 histories and cultures. Like Japan, Korea is also mountainous, although\ncoastal areas and plains located to the west and south were well-suited to agriculture.\nThe countries of East Asia share in the region\u2019s temperate climate and summer monsoon\nseason. During the summer months, warm and moist air originating from the Pacific flows\nfrom southeast to northwest, while during the winter months cold and dry air originating from\nCentral Asia moves in the opposite direction. Thus, those areas of East Asia located further to\nthe east and south are generally warmer and wetter, and for longer periods of time. That made\nthem well-suited to rice-paddy agriculture, and rice consequently became the primary cereal crop\nin southern China, the Korean peninsula, and the islands of Japan. While growing rice is labor\nintensive, this grain also offers high yields per unit of land, so it has supported population growth\nin these countries and, therefore, the formation of vibrant civilizations.\n4.6 CHINA FROM NEOLITHIC VILLAGE SETTLEMENTS TO THE\nSHANG KINGDOM\nChapters Two and Three cov-\nered the development of the first\nmajor civilizations of Mesopota-\nmia, Egypt, and India.

Looking\nback at the end of the Paleolithic\nera (c. 10,000 BCE), East Asia was\nsparsely populated by bands of\nforagers living in temporary set-\ntlements. During the eighth mil-\nlennium BCE, in China, some of\nthese hunter-gatherers turned to\ndomesticated cereals for a stable\nfood supply and settled into vil-\nlages so they could cultivate them.\nFigure 4.2 | Neolithic cultures in China c. 4000 BCE | Note the\nlocation of Yangshao culture along the upper and middle reaches Thus, the Neolithic Age (8000 \u2013\nof the Yellow River, where nearly a thousand settlements have been 2000 BCE) commenced.\nidentified by archaeologists.\nOver the course of those six\nAuthor: Lamassu Design\nSource: Wikimedia Commons millennia leading up to the Xia\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 Dynasty, Neolithic communities\nbecame more diverse and\ncomplex. For instance, for the period 5000 \u2013 3000 BCE, archaeologists have identified at least\neight major regional Neolithic cultures located along rivers and coasts (see Map 4.2). They did so\nby examining pottery styles and village settlement patterns. One example is Yangshao culture,\nwhich was concentrated along the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Over one thousand sites left\nbehind by millet-farming village communities have been discovered. Jiangzhai (c. 4000 BCE), for\ninstance, was a moated village settlement that occupied roughly thirteen acres (see Figure 4.2). It\nwas composed of related lineages and tribal in organization.\nDuring the third millennium BCE, Yangshao culture was gradually supplanted by Longshan\nculture (c. 3000 \u2013 1900 BCE), which emerged further to the east, along the middle and lower\nreaches of the Yellow River. In 1928, when archaeologists excavated a site near the town after\nwhich Longshan was named, they found evidence for a culture that had laid the foundations for the\nkingdoms that emerged in the second millennium BCE, including the ruins of numerous walled\ntowns with cemeteries outside (see Map 4.3). Their rammed-earth walls protected urban areas\nwith public buildings, roads, and drainage systems. The cemetery\u2019s arrangement suggests that\npeople living in the towns were buried alongside clan members, but also that some members were\nwealthier and more powerful: while most graves had nothing but a skeleton, others contained\nnumerous artifacts, such as pottery and jade.\nBased on this evidence, archaeologists have concluded that, during the third millennium\nBCE, population grew and some of it shifted from villages to walled towns. These walled towns\ndeveloped into political and economic centers exercising control over and serving as protection\nfor surrounding communities. Individuals with more elaborate graves were likely political and\nPage | 117 religious leaders, and served as chieftains.\nHence, numerous competing chiefdoms\nemerged, providing the foundation for\nmore powerful kingdoms to follow.\nAncient Chinese histories identify the\nfirst major kingdom as the Xia Dynasty\n(c. 1900 \u2013 1600 BCE).

Shang kings directly governed the capital and its vicinity, but likely\ncontrolled areas farther out by building confederations with locally powerful lineage chieftains,\nand regularly hunting, warring, and carrying out rituals with them. Some of those leaders were\ndirectly related to the Shang kings, and some were allies by marriage.\nThe bones are the most important source for understanding this kingdom. Most of the two\nhundred thousand fragments found so far are either turtle plastrons or scapula from cows.\nInterestingly, these were used for divination, which is why they are called oracle bones (see\nPage | 120 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nFigure 4.5). When Shang kings or his\ndiviners sought to know the future,\nthey would proceed to a temple erected\nin honor of a Shang deity or the spirits\nof deceased ancestors in the royal\nline. Before a stone tablet, they would\nmake a statement about what might\nhappen (for example, \u201cIt will rain,\u201d or\n\u201cIf we attack the Mafang [high god],\nDi will confer assistance on us\u201d), and\nthen apply heat to a hole bored into a\nbone until it cracked. The crack was\nviewed as the response from the god or\nspirit. The king would then determine\nwhether or not it was auspicious, and\nFigure 4.5 | Cache of oracle bones found at Anyang, China\na record would be inscribed on the\nAuthor: Xuan Che\nSource: Wikimedia Commons bone, sometimes including the actual\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 outcome (see Figure 4.6). From these,\nwe know that Shang elites believed that\na high god Di, nature gods, and the spirits of deceased kings controlled the future. That is why\nShang kings had massive bronzes cast and carried out sacrifices for them. The bronzes were filled\nwith food and placed at the temples, literally to feed\nthe spirits. Likewise, the sacrificial pits show that\na substantial shedding of blood for these higher\npowers was a regular occurrence. Shang elites\nworshipped their ancestors and frequently divined\nto determine their will.\n4.7 THE LONG ZHOU DYNASTY\n(1046 \u2013 256 BCE)\nAfter the Xia and Shang, the next major dynasty\nin Chinese history is the Zhou Dynasty (1045 \u2013\n256 BCE). In 1046 BCE, a Zhou king overthrew the\nlast Shang ruler and established control over much\nof north China. In the early centuries of Zhou rule,\nduring the Western Zhou (1046 \u2013 771 BCE), Zhou Figure 4.6 | An individual scapula showing\nthe cracks made and Chinese characters\nkings dispatched kinsmen to territories he granted\ninscribed during the divination process\nto them (see Map 4.6). These nobles were allowed Author: Herr Klugbeisser\nto rule their own lands hereditarily, so long as they Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nobserved certain obligations to their king.\nPage | 121 But over time, Zhou kings lost their ability to control these lords, and the lords became\nincreasingly independent. In 771 BCE, in what became a telling sign of weakness, the Zhou king\nwas murdered and his young successor was compelled to relocate farther east, to a capital closer\nto the heart of the North China Plain. This move marked the beginning of the Eastern Zhou (770\n\u2013 256 BCE). Over the long course of this half millennium, Zhou nobility engaged in escalating\nwarfare with each other over matters small and large. As they did so, their lands evolved into\npowerful states (see Map 4.7). Eventually, the noble lords of the most powerful states also declared\nthemselves kings, and fought to gain control over all of China. During the third century BCE,\nthe Zhou Kingdom was destroyed and one of these warring states, the Qin [Cheen] Dynasty,\nprevailed over the rest.\nBut these centuries were not only marked by the growth of states and accelerating warfare\nbetween them. Burgeoning turmoil also inspired much thinking about what was needful to restore\norder and create a good society, as well as what defined the good life. Two major philosophical\ntraditions emerged to address these issues: Confucianism and Daoism.\n4.7.1 The Western Zhou Dynasty (1046 \u2013 771 BCE)\nIn the eleventh century BCE, the Zhou state was a minor power on the western periphery of\nthe Shang realm, located along the Wei [way] River. In 1059, upon witnessing five planets align,\nthe Zhou ruler declared himself king and proceeded to engage in military conquests that made\nhis kingdom a regional power to be reckoned with. This was King Wen (\u201cCultured King\u201d), a ruler\nrevered as the founder of the Zhou dynasty. But it was his son King Wu (\u201cMartial King\u201d) who\nbrought down the Shang Dynasty. He assumed the throne upon his father\u2019s death and, in 1046, led\nthree-hundred chariots and 45,000 foot soldiers equipped with bronze armor and pole-mounted\ndagger-axes to a location just outside the Shang capital, where he met with and decisively defeated\nthe last Shang king and his army.\nKing Wu then returned to his capital in the Wei River Valley, where he passed away in 1043 BCE.\nHis young son took the throne, but was placed under the regency of Wu\u2019s capable brother, the Duke\nof Zhou. Now, the Zhou royal court was faced with the task of governing newly conquered territory,\nincluding the former lands of the Shang Dynasty. The king and his regent did so by implementing\nthree policies. First, they established a secondary capital farther east at Luoyang [low-yawng], closer\nto the North China Plain. Second, they issued proclamations explaining to conquered peoples why\nthey should accept Zhou rule. According to the Duke of Zhou, Heaven had decreed that Shang\nkings must fall and Zhou rulers should replace them. The Shang dynasty had begun with wise and\nbenevolent rulers, but later kings were cruel and incompetent, and failed to see to the well-being\nof their subjects. Thus, a dynasty once sanctioned by Heaven had lost this sanction; now, Heaven\nhad called upon Zhou rulers to overthrow the Shang dynasty and initiate a new era of just rule. This\npolitical theory, which is known as the Mandate of Heaven, would also be used by founders of\nlater dynasties to justify their actions, as well as by theorists to explain the rise and fall of dynasties.\nThe third policy the Zhou court adopted was to dispatch royal kinsmen to strategically critical\nlocations for the purpose of establishing colonies. At their royal palaces, Zhou kings conducted\nPage | 122 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nceremonies of investiture during which they\nsacrificed to Heaven and the spirits of deceased\nancestors, held banquets, and then bestowed\nnoble titles and grants of land upon members\nof the royal family and relatives by marriage.\nLarge bronzes were cast to commemorate\nthese occasions (see Figure 4.7). These lords\u2013\ndukes, marquis, earls, and barons\u2013then took\ntheir families, contingents of soldiers, and\nemblems of nobility to the granted territory\nand set up palaces and ancestral temples in\nwalled towns. From there, these illustrious\nlineages governed a predominantly rural\npopulation of farmers living in villages where\nlife was not easy. Living in hovels and with\nlittle opportunity to leave their lord\u2019s manors,\nthese farmers were required to work his lands\nand also to submit a portion of the harvest\nfrom their own small farms.\nHistorians call this method of governing\nZhou kinship feudalism. Feudalism\ngenerally describes a political and economic Figure 4.7 | Western Zhou Bronze Ritual Vessel |\nA Western Zhou bronze ritual vessel with an inscription\nsystem characterized by fragmented authority,\ncommemorating events at the court of King Wu.

Indeed, Zhou kings granted land License: CC0 1.0\nand noble titles to kinsmen in exchange for\nobedience, periodic visits to the king\u2019s palace, tribute, and military support. However, aside from\nthe presence of royal overseers, a hereditary lord enjoyed relative sovereignty in his own domain.\nThe glue that held the Zhou feudal order together was deference to the king and his Mandate\nand reverence for their shared history\u2013including, most importantly, the deceased spirits of their\nrelated ancestors.\nOver time, however, Zhou kinship feudalism failed to function as intended by the founding\nrulers. In brief, Zhou kings\u2019 ability to control the noble lords diminished over time, and their\nprestige suffered accordingly. There were two principal reasons for this. First, ties of kinship so\ncrucial to the founding of Zhou lost their meaning over time. In later generations, lords simply\nbecame more interested in and identified with their own territories, and they had little sense of\nsolidarity with what were at best distant cousins ruling neighboring feudal states. Hence, it is\nhardly surprising that histories inform us that the many lords ceased to pay visits to the king\u2019s\nPage | 123 court. Second, Zhou kings were unable to impose their will on feuding feudal lords and were\neven defeated by them in several military campaigns. In 771 BCE, for instance, King You [yo] was\nattacked by the allied forces of the lord of Shen and tribal peoples residing out west. The capital\nwas sacked, and he was killed. Other states came to the rescue, relocating the king\u2019s son, Prince\nPing, to the eastern capital at Luoyang. Zhou kings remained there for the next five hundred years,\nduring the period called the Eastern Zhou.\nMap 4.6 | The Western Zhou Dynasty | The capital was located along the Wei River valley, at Haojing. The\nnames of states granted by early Zhou kings to kinsmen and allies, along with their capitals, are indicated.\nAuthor: User \u201cPhilg88\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n4.7.2 The Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 \u2013 256 BCE) and the Warring\nStates Period (c. 475 \u2013 221 BCE)\nWhen King Ping was relocated to Luoyang, he ruled from a much smaller royal domain\nsurrounded by approximately 150 feudal states and their lords. His and his successors\u2019 power was,\nhowever, much reduced. No longer able to impose their will on unruly noble lineages, Zhou kings\nfailed to maintain a semblance of peace and order throughout the realm. Instead, this warrior\nnobility engaged in an escalating contest for power and prestige. By 475 BCE, in the wake of 540\nwars fought over the course of two centuries, only fifteen states remained (see Map 4.7). But they\nfought even more fiercely. Over the next 250 years, during what is referred to as the Warring\nPage | 124 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nStates Period (475 \u2013 221 BCE), these states averaged one major battle per year until, at the very\nend, only one remained standing. That was the state of Qin [cheen]. The Warring States period\nended in 221 BCE when the Qin ruler defeated the remaining states and unified the former Zhou\nrealm, initiating a new period in China\u2019s history. The line of Zhou kings had, however, already\nbeen extinguished in 256 BCE, so that date marks the end of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty.\nAs the frequency and scale of warfare escalated, and states gradually gobbled each other up,\nthe way feudal lords governed their states and conducted military campaigns changed. Prior to\nthe Warring States Period, Zhou kings were still accorded a level of respect, at least as symbols of\nunity and nominal heads of the Zhou feudal order. At this point, the many lords had no intention\nof toppling the king; rather, seeing his military weakness, the most powerful ones stepped in to\nenforce order. The first was Duke Huan of Qi [who-an of chee]. He held this title (\u201cduke\u201d) and fief\n(Qi) because his distant ancestor had served as a commander under King Wu during the Zhou\nfounding. Now, many generations later, his state was a formidable power on the east coast. In\nMap 4.7 | Eastern Zhou States (fifth century) | Map of the Eastern Zhou states as they looked during the\nfifth century BCE. The Zhou kingdom itself had relocated farther east, with its capital at Chengzhou. The map also\nhighlights the state of Qin. This rising power to the west would eventually conquer all of China and establish an empire\nAuthor: User \u201cYug\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 125 651 BCE, he convened an interstate meeting with other lords to discuss matters of order and\nsecurity. Upon being elected as their leader, the Zhou king conferred the title of hegemon. In this\ncapacity, Duke Huan had the authority to resolve disputes between nobles on behalf of the king.\nOver the next two centuries, this title changed hands several times, going to the lord of the\nmost powerful state. These hegemons periodically convened interstate meetings to manage such\nmatters as misbehaving states or foreign invasions. Attending lords cemented their agreements by\nswearing oaths and drinking the blood of sacrificed animals. Yet, although hegemons maintained\na semblance of order, warfare remained constant because it was a way of life for the illustrious\nlineages of the Zhou realm. Noble lords loved to demonstrate their prowess and raise their prestige\nthrough success in hunting and battling. A noble looked for a pretext to engage in a vendetta with\nanother lord, at which point a battle was arranged and then carried out according to the protocols of\nchivalry. After announcing the impending campaign at the ancestral temple, a lord and his kinsmen,\naccompanied by farmer foot soldiers, would proceed in their chariots to a prearranged location\nand engage in a skirmish. In victory, a noble redressed matters of honor and brought glory to his\nancestors, something symbolized by the mound of dead enemies placed by his ancestral temple.\nHowever, with the onset of the Warring States Period in the fifth century BCE, the level of\nviolence was no longer contained by the hegemon system and codes of chivalry. Both the purpose\nand conduct of warfare changed. Lords of the seven most powerful states lost respect for the Zhou\nkings and even assumed the same title, thus claiming the right to unify all of China under their\nrule. As opposed to serving a lesson to and resolving some dispute with another lord, these self-\ndeclared kings waged war to destroy them and take their land.\nHence, battles became increasingly bloody and bitter, and victory went to those kings who\ncould field the most effective killing machines. Chariot-riding kinsmen and a few thousand foot\nsoldiers no longer met that requirement. During the Warring States, rulers introduced large armies\ncomposed of mass infantry and cavalry. Soldiers were equipped with armor, crossbows, halberds,\ndagger-axes, and swords manufactured from bronze, iron, leather, and wood in royal workshops\nlocated at capital cities. (View the image of a Warring States Period soldier at the following\nlink: http://brandonqindynasty.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/3/9/10391259/8580061.jpeg. One\ndescription of an elite soldier states that he wears heavy armor, shoulders a large crossbow and\nfifty arrows, straps a halberd to his back, buckles a helmet to his head, and places a sword to his\nside.) Kings also militarized their kingdoms\u2019 landscapes by building forts at strategically critical\npasses, walls to mark off boundaries, and watch towers to signal the enemy\u2019s approach. Finally,\nthese rulers no longer relied solely on close kinsmen to wage war alongside them. Rather, they\ncreated a class of military commanders and specialists whose promotion was based on their\nability to produce victories in the field. It is therefore not surprising that during this time some\nof China\u2019s greatest military treatises were written, most notably the Art of War by Master Sun\n[sue-in]. Master Sun was a military commander and strategist who served the lords of the state\nof Wu just prior to the onset of the Warring States period (c. fifth century BCE). The manual of\nmilitary strategy and tactics attributed to him stresses the importance of formulating a strategy\nthat insures victory prior to any campaigning. Stratagem is critical. \u201cAll warfare is deception,\u201d\nMaster Sun states. \u201cHence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we\nPage | 126 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nmust seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far\naway, we must make him believe we are near.\u201d\nTo mobilize large numbers of men for war and supply them with weapons and grain, kings\ndevised ways to make their realms more productive and compliant with their will. Prior to the\nWarring States Period, it was the norm for nobility to hand out land in their states to kinsmen, just\nas it had been for the king during the Western Zhou. This practice meant that lesser but related\naristocratic lineages lived in estates across each noble\u2019s territory, while also serving as ministers at\nhis court. For a king, however, these men might become an obstacle or pose a threat because they\nheld this land hereditarily. Therefore, they devised better ways to control land in their realms.\nWhenever new territory was added or a noble line was extinguished, kings created counties and\nappointed magistrates to manage the villages and towns in that area. The magistrate\u2019s job would\nthen be to register the population, maintain law and order, collect tax revenue, and conscript\npeople for labor projects and military campaigns. And rather than give those posts to kinsmen,\nkings appointed men from the lower ranks of the nobility or commoners based on their loyalty\nand merit. Stated more simply, Warring States Period rulers created administrative units and a\ncivil service. Their embryonic bureaucracies included such features as a system of official posts,\nsalaries paid in grain and gifts, administrative codes, and methods for measuring a servant\u2019s\nperformance. Thus, by the end of this period, largely owing to the demands of warfare, the Zhou\nfeudal order had been supplanted by a small number of powerful territorial states with centralized\nmonarchies. Among them, the most successful was the state of Qin, which eventually conquered\nall of China and became an empire. We return to that topic after reviewing the ideas put forward\nby philosophers in the context of these centuries of turmoil.\n4.7.3 Philosophy in a Time of Turmoil: Confucianism and Daoism\nChina\u2019s three major pre-modern philosophical and religious traditions are Confucianism,\nDaoism, and Buddhism. The first two had their origins in the later centuries of the Eastern Zhou,\nwhile Buddhism only began to arrive from South Asia in the first century C.E. Confucianism and\nDaoism were both responses to the crisis presented by the breakdown of the Zhou feudal order\nand escalating warfare in China.\n4.7.3.1: Confucius and Confucianism\nConfucius lived just prior to the Warring States Period (551-479 BCE). What little we know\nabout his life comes primarily from the Analects, a record of conversations Confucius held with\nhis students compiled after he died. In later centuries, in China, Confucius was revered as a sage\nand teacher, and even today outside of China some people might think of him as a stern pedant,\nperhaps calling to mind sayings beginning with \u201cThe Master said.\u201d However, in the context of\nhis time, Confucius was anything but stiff and rather a dynamic individual who believed he was\nmandated by Heaven to return the world to a more socially and politically harmonious time. The\nAnalects not only shows a serious and learned man, but also someone capable in archery and\nhorsemanship, who loved music and ritual, and who untiringly travelled the feudal states in the\nPage | 127 hopes of serving in a lord\u2019s retinue (see Figure 4.8). According to\none passage, a lord once asked one of Confucius\u2019s students about\nhis master, but the student fell silent. Later, Confucius asked\nhim, \u201cWhy did you not say: As a man, when agitated in thought\nhe forgets to eat, joyfully forgetting his cares, not realizing that\nold age is near at hand?\u201d\nConfucius was born to a family of minor nobility and modest\nmeans in the feudal state of Lu. His father died about the time\nConfucius was born, and he was raised by his mother, who also\npassed away when Confucius was young. Like other young men\nof similar background, he had access to an education and could\naspire to serve in some capacity in a feudal state, perhaps at the\nlord\u2019s court, or as an official or soldier. Confucius chose to become\nlearned and seek office. To his mind, he was living at a time\nwhen civilization was collapsing and society was decaying. He\nbelieved that, during the early Zhou, the nobility was honorable,\nobserved moral codes, and upheld social standards. He believed\nthat a golden age existed in the past and wished to transmit the Figure 4.8 | Portrait of\nethical values of that time. However, in the course of doing so, he Confucius from the Tang\nDynasty\nreinterpreted the past and imbued the virtues he stressed with\nAuthor: User \u201cLouis le Grand\u201d\nrich, new meanings. Here are a few of the important statements Source: Wikimedia Commons\nConfucius made, and what they meant: License: Public Domain\n1. \u201cThe noble person is concerned with rightness,\nthe small person is concerned with profit.\u201d (4.16) Confucius redefined the meaning\nof nobility. For him, nobility was defined not by birth but rather by character and\nconduct. A truly noble person is one who puts what is right before personal gain and\nthe desire for wealth and fame.\n2. \u201cYoung men should be filial at home and respectful to their elders when away from\nhome.\u201d (1.6) Filial piety is central to Confucius\u2019s thought. He taught how a person\nbecomes moral because a good society only develops when composed of and led by\nvirtuous people. He saw the practice of morality in the family as the root. Should a\nyoung man learn to be respectful and reverent towards parents and elders, he will\nbecome a humane person, and humane people are far more likely to contribute in a\npositive way to society.\n3. \u201cThe noble man does not abandon humaneness for so much as the space of a meal.\u201d\n(4.5) For Confucius, the highest virtue is humanity, and many of his conversations\ncenter upon defining what it is that makes a person humane. A person of humanity is,\nfor instance, one who is capable of empathy and unselfish concern for the welfare of\nothers. They know the golden rule: \u201cwhat you would not want for yourself,\u201d he taught,\nPage | 128 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\n\u201cdo not do to others.\u201d (15.23) Confucius emphasized that a society cannot function if\npeople are incapable of taking other\u2019s perspectives and doing their best for them. In\naddition, he insisted that such virtues as humanity are most fully demonstrated when\nindividuals observe good etiquette. Decorum was important to Confucius.\n4. \u201cHeaven has given birth to the virtue that is in me.\u201d 1 (7.22) Interpreters of Confucius\nhave rightly noted that he is quite silent about the supernatural and what happens\nafter death, rather emphasizing the life we have and serving others. Yet, it would be\nwrong to conclude that he wasn\u2019t religious in any sense, because he frequently spoke\nof Heaven. He believed that Heaven ordains a certain course of life for each individual,\nincluding becoming a moral person. This Heaven, however, is less a deity than a\nhigher moral order, a kind of beneficent presence.\n5. \u201cTo govern is to rectify. If you lead the people by being rectified yourself, who will dare\nnot be rectified?\u201d (12.17) Confucius believed that good governing flows from good men.\nThe first qualification for a ruler or one who serves is moral rectitude. If those who\nlead do so by virtue and conduct themselves according to rules of propriety, people\nwill learn from them and develop a sense of honor and shame. Consequently, society\nwill become more orderly.\nThe noble person, filial piety, humaneness, etiquette, Heaven, and government by men of virtue\nare just some of the ideas Confucius discussed as he traveled the feudal states seeking to advise their\nlords. However, he only managed to hold some minor offices in Lu and generally failed in his political\naspirations. Instead, he gained an avid following of 70 students, whom he accepted regardless of\ntheir social status. After he died, they passed on his teachings, and a school of thought emerged\nfrom his teachings known as Confucianism. Those who belonged to it are Confucians\u2013individuals\ndistinguished by their commitment to the ideas articulated by Confucius, classical learning, and the\nvalue they place on character and conduct as the key to a good society and political order.\n4.7.3.2: Philosophical and Institutional Daoism\nDuring the turmoil of the Warring States period, however, other individuals developed a\nphilosophy very different from Confucianism called Daoism. These Daoists largely rejected\nConfucian ideas about human moral development and social order as artificial constructs. Rather,\nthey pointed to a natural condition that both individuals and society can recover, one that existed\nbefore desires trapped people in a world of strife. Their central concept is the Dao (\u201cWay\u201d). The\nDao is mysterious: it is beyond sense perception and yet the source of life and the universe, the\nultimate truth transcending the polarities that make up life and yet pervades them, empty and yet\nthe mother of all things.\nParadoxically, although the Dao is indescribable and can\u2019t be seen or heard, the goal of the\nDaoist is to accord with and follow it. But this goal won\u2019t be accomplished through more seeking and\n1 These selections from the Analects are translated in De Bary and Bloom, ed., Sources of Chinese Tradition, Vol. 1: From\nEarliest Times to the Present, 44-63.\nPage | 129 more knowledge. Rather, the mind must be emptied\nout, calmed, and purified, until desires are absent and a\nprimordial, natural condition is restored. At that point,\nwhen the individual is in accord with the ineffable Way,\nlife becomes spontaneous, natural, and effortless.\nThe two most important early books belonging to this\ntradition are named after their putative authors: the\nLaozi (\u201cOld Master\u201d) and Zhuangzi (\u201cMaster Zhuang\u201d).\nHistorians believe the \u201cOld Master\u201d was a fictional sage\ninvented by Warring States Period philosophers who\ncompiled the book attributed to him. Master Zhuang,\nhowever, lived during the fourth century BCE.\nIn later centuries, the Daoism of these early\nphilosophers was taken in new directions. The\nFigure 4.9 | An image representing basic\nelements of Daoist cosmology | According definition of the Way was broadened to include the\nto that cosmology, the yin and yang (at center, idea that individuals have a spiritual essence in need\nblack and white) arise from one underlying\nof harmonizing and liberation.

Daoists even entertained the idea that\nperiphery)\none could become immortal. To achieve these goals,\nAuthor: User \u201cPakua_with_name\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons techniques were developed, including special dietary\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.5 regimens, yoga, Chinese boxing, meditation, and\nalchemy.\nOver the course of the first millennium CE, Daoism also became a popular and institutionalized\nreligion. Daoist masters, claiming divine inspiration, composed esoteric texts for their followers.\nThese texts explained how the natural world originated from a primordial ether (qi) and its\ndivision into two polar forces: the yin and yang (see Figure 4.9). They presented a universe with\nmultiple heavenly and hellish realms populated with divinities and demons. The principal purpose\nof these Daoists was to attend to a person\u2019s physical and psychological well-being. That involved\nnot only teaching individual techniques for preserving the life spirit, but also the use of exorcism\nand faith healing to remove malevolent influences. Daoists also developed communal prayers and\nrituals that could cure illness, free souls from hell, win blessings from heaven, and eliminate sins\nfrom the community. Eventually, a Daoist church developed, with its own ordained priesthood,\ntemples, and monasteries.\n4.8 THE QIN DYNASTY AND THE TRANSITION FROM ANCIENT\nTO IMPERIAL CHINA\nIn 219 BCE, while touring his realm, the First Emperor of Qin [cheen] (259 \u2013 210 BCE)\nerected a stone tablet atop a mountain with an inscription proclaiming:\nPage | 130 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nThey [the Qin ministers] recall and contemplate the times of chaos:\nWhen [regional lords] apportioned the land, established their states,\nAnd thus unfolded the pattern of struggle.\nAttacks and campaigns were daily waged;\nThey shed their blood in the open countryside. . . .\nNow today, the August Emperor has unified All-under-Heaven into one family\u2014\nWarfare will not arise again!\nDisaster and harm are exterminated and erased,\nThe black-headed people live in peace and stability, benefits and blessings are lasting\nand enduring.2\nIndeed, just two years\nprior, in 221 BCE, the First\nEmperor had brought the\nWarring States Period to a\nclose by defeating the last\nremaining state. Hence,\nhe had realized the aspi-\nrations held by the ma-\nny rulers he subjugated,\nthat is, to unify the known\nworld under one powerful\nmonarch and, by so do-\ning, to initiate an age of\npeace and prosperity, one\nrooted in obedience to a\nsagely ruler.\nThe title \u201cFirst Emper-\nor of Qin,\u201d however, was\nassumed by this conquer-\nor only in the wake of his\nfinal victory, and it made\nsense. Having crushed the\nMap 4.8 | The Qin Empire in 210 BCE | The capital was located along the\nmany warring kingdoms,\nWei River Valley at Xianyang.\nthe First Emperor did in- Author: User \u201cItsmine\u201d\ndeed create something Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nnew and more significant:\nan immense territorial\nstate centrally administered from his capital, by a monarch with unchallenged sovereignty (see\nMap 4.8). So how did his state\u2013the Qin kingdom\u2013prevail?\n2 Adapted from a translation in Yuri Pines, \u201cThe Messianic Emperor: A New Look at Qin\u2019s Place in China\u2019s History,\u201d 264-265.\nPage | 131 When the First Emperor inherited the Qin throne at the age of 13 in 246 BCE, he became\nKing Zheng [jung], young ruler of the most powerful of the seven remaining Warring States.\nLooking back, he would understand that he had inherited a state whose origins dated back to\nthe Western Zhou Period, when land to the west of the Zhou kings was granted as a fief to his\nchieftain forbears. The Qin star first rose when a Qin lord assisted King Ping in relocating to the\neastern capital during the transition from the Western to the Eastern Zhou Period (c. 770 BCE).\nAt that time, the old Zhou heartland was granted to him, and he was elevated to the status of a\nregional lord, the Duke of Qin.\nThe Dukes of Qin were important players throughout the centuries of warfare and alliances so\ncharacteristic of the Eastern Zhou, and especially after the reforms of Duke Xiao [she-ow] (r. 361\n\u2013 338). These reforms were based on the advice of his chancellor Shang Yang [shawng yawng],\nan individual famed for being one of the founders of another major intellectual tradition that\ndeveloped during the Warring States Period: Legalism. The legalists were in tune with the efforts\nMap 4.9 | Warring States & Qin Conquest | This map shows states that yet remained at the end of the Warring\nStates Period, when the state of Qin was unifying China through massive military campaigns.

Used with permission.\nPage | 132 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nrulers were putting forth to strengthen their states. Their goal was to devise the best techniques\nfor organizing a state\u2019s territory and people so as to maximize a ruler\u2019s power and control in times\nof both war and peace. Legalists believed that the best way to do so was to concentrate authority\nin one central administration governed by an absolute monarch.\nTo these ends, Shang Yang introduced many measures, laying the foundations for future Qin\ngreatness. He believed that the basis for state power lay with an obedient and disciplined farming\npopulation, because that was the principal source of revenue and conscripts for the army. So he\norganized villages across the land into units of five families each, and made the members of each\nunit responsible for each other. Every member would be rewarded based on the amount of grain\nthe unit produced or the number of severed heads returned from the battlefield. For meritorious\nservice to the state, a unit could advance along a system of ranks, each of which bestowed certain\nprivileges. But should any member commit a crime, everyone would be severely punished. To make\nthis more effective, the Qin state developed a legal code with clear lists of penalties for specific\ncrimes, made it publicly available, and applied it uniformly to people regardless of their social\nstatus. Also, the Qin was among the most effective in establishing a civil service and county system\nto administer the law. Qin subjects lived under a regime with a transparent set of expectations, and\nalso a system of rewards and punishments. Such rationality in matters of efficiently organizing a\nstate through the uniform application of laws and regularizing administration, as implemented by\nShang Yang, were a mark of legalist thinkers\u2019 methods.\nAfter Duke Xiao\u2019s and Shang Yang\u2019s time, Qin rulers assumed the title of king and engaged in\nnumerous battles, destroying several neighboring states. Some of these were major engagements.\nAccording to one account, after the Qin kingdom defeated the state of Zhao, a Qin general ordered\n400,000 captured soldiers\nburied alive. Also, the Qin\nput an end to the Zhou royal\nline after conquering their\nterritory in 256 BCE. Hence,\nKing Zheng was heir to a\nkingdom whose success in\nbattle derived in part from\nlegalist reforms. In line\nwith that tradition, he too\nemployed a legalist advisor.\nAs of 230 BCE, only\nsix other Warring States\nremained (see Map 4.9).\nOver the next decade, King\nZheng led a series of massive\nFigure 4.10 | Replica of the palace of the First Emperor of Qin campaigns each of which\nAuthor: User \u201ckanegen\u201d\nentailed both sides fielding\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY 2.0 over one hundred thousand\nPage | 133 soldiers. This was a bloody time, as one state after another fell. By 221 BCE, the Chinese realm was\nunified under Qin rule.\nAlthough the Qin Dynasty (221 \u2013 207 BCE) was brief-lived, it had a lasting effect on China\nbecause of the stable administrative foundation it laid. The First Emperor of Qin and his advisors\ninvented the title used by all subsequent rulers. They made newly conquered territory a part\nof their centralized bureaucracy. From his royal court and central administration, the emperor\ngoverned a land organized into a hierarchical system of commanderies (provinces that began as\nmilitary outposts) and counties. His regime standardized currency and the system of writing, and\nissued regulations for uniform weights and measures.\nThe emperor was also a great builder. Over 6800 kilometers of road were laid to connect the\ncapital at Xianyang to each province and the northern border. Walls built by former northern\nstates to protect against non-Chinese nomads to their north were linked together in an earlier\nversion of the Great Wall. All of these measures served to facilitate communication and commerce\nacross the land and, therefore, political stability and cultural unification. As a symbol of his power,\nthe First Emperor also constructed an imposing palace (see Figure 4.10) and mausoleum (see\nIntroduction). For all these reasons, historians mark Qin unification as the beginning of China\u2019s\nimperial era.\n4.9 THE HAN DYNASTY, 202 BCE \u2013 220 CE\nAfter the First Emperor died in 210 BCE, the Qin Empire rapidly disintegrated. Historians\ndebate causes but highlight weak successors manipulated by the intrigues of a high minister and\ncourt eunuch; excessive demands on the population for building projects, tax revenue, and military\nconscription; and a climate of fear created by the harshly punitive legal system. Regardless, by\n207 BCE revolts were breaking out across the land, as rebels accrued armies, seized territory,\nand even declared themselves kings. China then fell into a state of civil war for five years until the\nintervention of Liu Bang [lee-oh bawng] (d. 195 BCE). A former farmer and village headman\nwho rebelled and built an army and kingdom through his military acumen and charisma, Liu\nBang defeated his adversaries and declared himself emperor of a new dynasty.\n4.9.1 Government and Society during the Han Dynasty\nThe Han Dynasty, ruled by 24 successive emperors from the Liu imperial family, is normally\ndivided into a Western Han (202 \u2013 8 BCE) and Eastern Han (25 \u2013 220 CE) because for a brief\ntime an imperial in-law usurped the throne and established his own short-lived dynasty. This\nbrief interregnum aside, the Han Dynasty lasted 400 years, making it second in length only to\nthe Zhou Dynasty. So important was the Han to establishing a pattern in Chinese civilization\ndistinguishing people belonging to it from those around them that Chinese people today refer to\ntheir ethnic group as Han Chinese. Also, after adopting the foundations laid by the Qin Dynasty,\nthe Han further strengthened them, cementing an imperial pattern that persisted in China until\nthe fall of the last dynasty (Qing) in 1911.\nPage | 134 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nMap 4.10 | Map of the Han Dynasty in 2 CE | During the Western Han, the capital was located at\nChang\u2019an, while during the Eastern Han, it was located at Luoyang. Note the location of the Xiongnu\nconfederation of nomadic pastoralists living on the steppe lands to the north of China. Han China\nalso extended control far into Central Asia in order to secure the Silk Road trade routes. Most of the\ndependent states and tributary cities indicated by green and orange dots were brought under the\ncontrol of China during the reign of Emperor Wu.\nAuthor: Yeu Ninje\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nAs opposed to studying a chronology of important events during these centuries, let\u2019s consider\nthe general picture for the political system and society of the Han Empire. The majority of people\u2013\nas much as 90 percent of the population\u2013were farmers, living out their lives in villages of a dozen\nto over 100 households. Some were independent farmers who owned small farms; some, tenants\nwho leased land from owners of larger farms; and some, local magnates with large estates (see\nFigure 4.11). The government relied heavily on the first group for revenue and conscription and\ntherefore tried to keep these owner-farmers in business with low taxes, relief in times of hardship,\nand improvement in their agricultural methods. Unfortunately, over the course of the dynasty,\nmany farmers fell on hard times and were forced to sell their land to powerful landlords, thus\nbecoming their tenants or even slaves. Landlordism thus became a major social and political\nproblem, as local great families dominated ever more dependent poor, undermining the central\ngovernment\u2019s revenue base.\nPage | 135 The remaining ten percent of the population lived in urban areas\u2013the towns and cities of\nHan China\u2013as artisans and traders or officials and garrison soldiers. By some estimates, the total\npopulation during these centuries hovered at 60 million, which means about six million were urban\nresidents. Many cities, such as the capitals of both the Western and Eastern Han, had over 100,000\nresidents (see Map 4.10). The first imperial capital, Chang\u2019an [chawng-an] (\u201cForever Peace\u201d), was\na walled city with twelve gates, watchtowers, market places, residential wards, administrative\nbuildings and, of course, the imperial palace. Some of the agricultural produce, manufactured\ngoods, and raw materials filling up the marketplaces testify to what artisans and traders were\nbusy making, buying, and selling: cooked meats, pickled vegetables, fish, and grains; utensils and\ntools made of wood, brass, and iron; lacquer ware, jade, and furs; and textiles fashioned from silk\nand hemp. Imperial highways and lesser byways, and canals and other waterways, provided the\nroutes for moving these goods both within and beyond China. Ever suspicious of the profit motive\nand believing in the foundational importance of the farmer, government officials supervised city\nmarkets and established agencies to regulate the most important industries.\nThese commoner classes\u2013farmers,\nartisans, and traders\u2013were governed\nby a highly organized state and its\ncorps of educated, professional civil\nservants. For administrative purposes,\nthe empire was eventually divided into\nroughly 100 commanderies and 1300\ncounties. 130,000 officials constituted\nthe bureaucracy. At the lowest level,\nworking with village and town leaders,\ncounty magistrates handled such\nmatters as tax collection, population\nregistration, conscription for military\nservice, law and order, and public\nworks. They submitted reports to, and\ntook orders from, commandery level\nmilitary and civil officials, who then Figure 4.11 | Estate of a wealthy official during the Eastern\nHan Dynasty, as represented in the interior of his tomb\ndid the same with the nine ministries\nAuthor: User \u201cEditor at Large\u201d\nof the central government. These Source: Wikimedia Commons\nministries handled such matters as License: CC BY-SA 2.5\nrevenue, justice, and foreign relations.\nThe heads of each of these ministries, as well as two chancellors, routinely held audiences with the\nemperor to decide all policy matters. An independent branch of government, the censorate, audited\nthe rest and reported directly to the emperor.\nFrom the outset, the Han Dynasty inherited the Qin legalist system of government, with its\nemphasis on rational and efficient methods of administration and use of systems of rewards and\npunishments to promote order. However, early in the Han, Confucian scholars criticized Qin\nPage | 136 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\ngoverning for lacking humaneness, and Han rulers increasingly saw the benefit of Confucian ideas\nto governing. This change was particularly the case with Emperor Wu [woo] (r. 141 \u2013 87 BCE).\nDuring his reign, Confucius\u2019s ideas were molded into an ideology that legitimated monarchy and\na hierarchical social order. This ideology is called Imperial Confucianism. As an ideology, it\nsimply provided a blueprint for how the political and social order should function.\nFigure 4.12 | Painting depicting paragons of filial piety on a box excavated from a Han Dynasty tomb |\nDuring the Han Dynasty, Confucian values penetrated society, especially the idea that a child should actively\ndemonstrate their reverence and respect for parents.\nAuthor: User \u201cPericlesofAthens\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nRulers saw the benefit in having officials who were highly educated, loyal, of good character,\nand who understood the formalities of ritual and etiquette. An Imperial Academy was founded\nat the capital in 124 so that students could be educated in classical Confucian texts, including\nthe Analects. Across the country, these students were nominated by local officials based on\ntheir learnedness and virtuous conduct. Successful graduates went on to serve as officials, and,\nbecause that conferred the highest prestige and status on an individual in Han China, Confucian\nvalues penetrated society. Texts were compiled explaining good etiquette, conduct, and ritual\nrequirements for each family member and members of society based on their superior or\nsubordinate status. Filial piety was celebrated in both art and texts (see Figure 4.12), and law\ncodes reinforced social norms by, for example, supporting the authority of the family patriarch,\ndivision of property among sons, and arranged marriages. In brief, over the course of the Han\nDynasty, Chinese increasingly identified themselves as defenders of a Confucian civilization.\nThe emperor was at the pinnacle of both Han society and the political system, while the\nimperial family and in-laws constituted a privileged aristocracy. The emperor\u2019s authority derived\nPage | 137 in theory from his having received the mandate of Heaven, his virtue, and his role as mediator\nbetween the celestial realms and human world; as such, he could expect his subjects\u2019 obedience\nand loyalty. He resided within the walls of the imperial palace at the capital city, attended by\neunuchs who handled his personal needs, palace administration, and the imperial harem.\nEmperors had numerous consorts but also a principal wife\u2013the empress\u2013who held a special\nstatus and was quite influential, usually because she bore the heir to the throne, but also because\nshe and her in-laws were an intimate part of the emperor\u2019s palace life. Often, the imperial family,\nimperial in-laws, eunuchs, and high officials broke apart into squabbling factions fighting for\npower and influence; this contention had deleterious consequences for the smooth functioning\nof the political system.\n4.9.2 China and the Outer World during the Han Dynasty\nStrengthened by its ever more confident political system and society, Han China also became\nan expansive empire, occupying and colonizing territory all along its borders. Sometimes this\nprocess was gradual: as migrants and merchants moved into neighboring areas, the government\nfollowed by setting up garrisons to protect them and eventually counties with civil servants to\ngovern them. In other cases, armies were sent to subdue unstable borders or to secure trade\nroutes. Regardless, as the dominant power in the region, China\u2019s actions profoundly influenced\nand shaped the history of peoples and states in neighboring areas of Central and East Asia.\nTraditionally, the biggest threats to the settled agricultural population of China came from\nnon-Chinese nomadic pastoralists scattered about the steppe lands along the northern border\n(see Chapter Ten). These skilled horsemen and hunters tended their herds from horseback,\nresided in mobile campsites made up of yurts, and organized as tribes. These tribes usually\nselected the most skilled male warriors as their chieftains and also periodically organized into\nconfederations so as to raid Chinese villages and towns (see Chapter Ten). During the Han, the\nmost threatening confederation was knit together by Xiongnu [she-ong-new] (see Map 4.10). The\nfounding emperor, Liu Bang, sought to subdue them with his armies but was defeated and forced\nto pay tribute and offer imperial princesses in marriage to their chieftains. Emperor Wu, however,\nenjoying a stronger government, sent massive armies of over 100,000 soldiers campaigning deep\ninto Xiongnu territory, breaking up their confederation and forcing them to relocate. Although\nhis armies suffered great losses, Emperor Wu established garrisons across the northern border to\nconsolidate his gains and protect China.\nAs Emperor Wu brought the Xiongnu under control, he became curious about Central\nAsian territories lying to the west of China. Interested in finding allies that might support him\nin his efforts to control nomad confederations, he sent envoys on exploratory missions. They\nreturned with news of trade routes extending from oasis city-states ringing the forbidding\ndeserts of the Taklamakan Desert to countries lying beyond the Pamir Mountains. What they\nwere speaking of were the earliest Silk Roads (see Map 4.11). Merchants had been using\ncamels to carry such goods as silk from China to distant civilizations while bringing back\ngold, horses, and various handicrafts and foodstuffs. For that reason, beginning in 104 BCE,\nPage | 138 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nEmperor Wu dispatched armies to subdue the region as far as the Pamir Mountains, making\nthe Han Dynasty overlords to Central Asian states, which were now obligated to send tribute\nand hostages. A frontier network of walls and watchtowers was then extended partway into the\nregion. The Silk Roads were thus secured, and, because it could be conducted more safely, the\nvolume of traffic grew. During the Han Dynasty, China demonstrated its intention of being a\ndominant player in Central Asia.\nMap 4.11 | Map of the Silk Road trade routes during the Han Dynasty\nAuthor: Wikimedia Commons User \u201c\u0410\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c\u201d and Leo Timm\nSource: Wikimedia Commons and The Epoch Times\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\n4.9.3 Conclusion: The Han Dynasty and Empires in History\nThese are some of the outstanding features of the Han Empire, and ones that can also be\ncompared to other empires that existed at this time in other parts of the world, such as Mauryan\nEmpire in India (see Chapter Three), Persian Empire in the Middle East (Chapter Five), or Roman\nEmpire (see Chapter Six). Each empire conferred a special status on rulers, had an organized\nimperial administration with an educated civil service, maintained a large army to defend an\nexpanding and increasingly well-defined territory, and developed an ideology and legal codes\nthat justified authority and reinforced social order. Confident in the superiority of their organized\ngovernments, powerful militaries, and worldview, each of these empires proceeded to extend\ncontrol over neighboring states and peoples.\nPage | 139 4.10 THE PERIOD OF DIVISION, 220 \u2013 589 CE\nLike these other empires, the Han Dynasty also eventually fell. China was then divided up\nby independent, short-lived kingdoms until 589 CE, when the Sui Dynasty reunited most of\nthe territory once controlled by the Han. Thus, for four centuries, during what is known as the\nPeriod of Division, China was politically unstable and racked by endemic warfare. Yet, in spite\nof the violence, these centuries also saw vibrant cultural developments, as Buddhism became an\norganized institutional religion reshaping the spiritual landscape.\n4.10.1 Political History\u2013From Three Kingdoms (220 \u2013 280) and the Western\nJin (265 \u2013 317) to the Northern and Southern Dynasties (317 \u2013 589)\nDuring the second century CE, a combination of factors led to massive rebellions against\nthe Han Dynasty by lower classes living in the countryside. Many once thriving, independent\nfarmers who fell on hard times lost their land to powerful local families who used their political\nconnections to amass large estates. A series of floods and droughts and the famines and epidemics\nthey caused only worsened these farmers\u2019 plight, and the government was ineffective in providing\nrelief. During the later Han, government revenue had fallen because local magnates kept their\ngrowing estates off the tax rolls. Also, many later Liu emperors were mere youths dominated by\nquarreling factions of imperial in-laws and eunuchs, so the quality of governing declined.\nDesperate to escape poverty and starvation, many villagers fled their homes or joined roving\nbandit gangs. Some rallied behind individuals who promised the dawn of a new age, thereby\nbecoming part of large, militarized religious societies with political goals. One was the Yellow\nTurbans, a society named after the yellow cloth members wrapped around their heads. The\nfounder, Zhang Jue [jawng joo-eh], claimed he was a devoted follower of the legendary Daoist\nphilosopher Laozi, who had by this time been deified and envisioned living in a Daoist heaven. Zhang\naccrued a following of disciples by instructing them in faith healing, establishing a rudimentary\norganization, and prophesying an impending apocalypse. He led his followers to believe that the\napocalypse would be followed by an age of peace when the sky would turn yellow and all would\nbe equal. The movement grew into the tens of thousands. Some followers proclaimed 184 CE\nwas propitious, daubing the characters for that year in mud on the gates to government offices.\nThe Yellow Turbans rebelled, and unrest spread across north China. Other similar millenarian\nreligious movements followed.\nThe Han Dynasty was in crisis but lacked the strong leadership of earlier rulers like the\nfounder Liu Bang or Emperor Wu. Youthful emperors were forced to rely on generals who\ncommanded permanent standing armies around the empire as if they were private possessions.\nBut by empowering military strongmen to suppress rebellions, Han rulers sealed the fate of the\ndynasty. Generals feuded amongst each other and competed to impose a military dictatorship\non the court. Eventually, in 220 CE, one general deposed the Han emperor, but he failed to\nunite the realm because by that time the country had been divided up by three kingdoms and\ntheir rival warlords.\nPage | 140 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nWithin their realms, each warlord sought to strengthen his hand against the others by\nrestoring order and establishing a functioning state. After all, they needed fighting men and\nrevenue. Cao Cao (155 \u2013 220 CE) was the most effective in achieving these goals. He was\nthe adopted son of a Han court eunuch and eventually entered the military. As a commander,\nhe earned his spurs leading Han armies against the Yellow Turbans. As the dynasty fell apart,\nhe gained control over it and established a dictatorship in northern China. It was his son who\nremoved the last Han ruler and established the Wei [way] Dynasty (220 \u2013 265 AD), one of the\nThree Kingdoms (see Map 4.12).\nMap 4.12 | Map of the Three Kingdoms | These took shape as the Han Dynasty ended. Cao Cao was the founder\nof the northern state of Wei.\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nBy this time, as a result of the rebellions and civil wars, much land in north China had gone to\nwaste. So Cao Cao turned it into huge state farms where he could settle his soldiers, landless poor, and,\nmost importantly, tribes of nomadic herders from the steppe lands to the far north who had served\nhim as he came to power. Thus, Cao rulers created colonies of farmers who supplied tax revenue\nPage | 141 and, as hereditary military families,\nsoldiers for Wei armies. Such state-\nowned land and hereditary soldiers\nbecame the mainstays of warlord\ndynasties throughout this time.\nThe two other kingdoms, Wu and\nHan, were located in the south. Over\nthe course of decades, the ruling\nwarlords of all three states fought\neach other in campaigns involving\nmuch treachery and stratagem. In\n263 CE, the Han kingdom fell to the\ninvading forces of Wei commanders.\nBut then, just two years later, a\npowerful Wei family\u2013the Sima\u2013\nusurped the throne and changed\nthe kingdom\u2019s name to Western Jin\nMap 4.13 | China during the Northern and Southern Dynasties | [jean] (265 \u2013 317 CE).

The policy of settling tribes of non-Chinese\nnomads in north China backfired. Among them, rebel\nchieftains rose up, carved out kingdoms of their own, and\nexpanded their power all across the north. One Xiongnu\nchieftain, Liu Yuan [lee-oh you-anne], even declared he\nwas a descendant of a Han Dynasty imperial princess and\ntherefore had the right to restore the Han Empire. His\nson descended on the Western Jin court at Luoyang and\neventually, in 317 CE, forced it to flee east to Jiankang [jee-\nan cawng] (today\u2019s city of Nanjing).\nChina was again divided up among competing dynasties, Figure 4.13 | Terracotta figurine\ndepicting a Northern Wei soldier on\na state of affairs that would persist until 589 CE, during a time\nhorseback | The Northern Wei was one\nreferred to as the Northern and Southern Dynasties (317 of the Northern Dynasties\n\u2013 589).

But their\nrulers were usually militarily\nweak and lacked revenue, due\nto southern China\u2019s comprising\na colonial frontier dominated\nby powerful families with large\nestates and private armies.\nThese families highly valued\ntheir pedigrees, intermarried,\nand saw themselves as the\nheirs to Confucian civilization.\nAt the southern court, they\ndominated high offices, thus\nconstituting a hereditary\naristocracy. The ruling family\nwas always limited in power by\ntheir influence.\nThe situation was even\nmore complex in the north\nduring those three centuries.

The Liu rulers, for instance, were Xiongnu, while others were of Turkic ancestry. At times,\nthe north was divided among numerous, rival regimes, while, at others, it was unified. But all of\nthese kingdoms shared similar characteristics. They were ruled by military dynasts who wanted to\nrestore the Chinese empire. Their armies consisted of an elite, heavily armored cavalry drawn from\naristocratic military families that was supplemented by Chinese foot soldiers (see Figure 4.13).\nThey employed educated Chinese to serve as civil officials and administer their territories.\nThe Northern and Southern Dynasties came to an end in 589 CE after Yang Jian [yawng gee-\nan], a general hailing from the ruling clan of a northern kingdom, first established control over all\nof north China and then defeated the last southern dynasty. He ruled his new Sui [sway] Dynasty\nas Emperor Wen [one]. China was once again united under one dynasty (see Map 4.14).\n4.10.2 China\u2019s Third Great Tradition: The Introduction of Buddhism to China\nAside from the shifting configuration of kingdoms, perhaps the most notable development\nduring the Period of Division was the introduction of Mahayana (\u201cGreat Vehicle\u201d) Buddhism into\nPage | 143 China (for the development of Mahayana Buddhism, see Chapter Three). Beginning from the\nsecond century CE, at the end of the Han Dynasty, Buddhist merchants and monks from India and\nCentral Asia brought their faith and scriptures to China by the Silk Roads and maritime trading\nroutes (see Map 4.15). The impact was immense and can be compared to the Christianization of\nthe Mediterranean region and spread of devotional forms of Hinduism in South Asia during this\nsame period of time (see Chapters Three and Six). Historians estimated that by the time the Sui\nDynasty reunited China four centuries later, China had approximately 33,000 Buddhist temples\nand two million monks and nuns. Buddhism had become a large-scale religious organization\nwith these temples, clerics, and scriptures (see Figure 4.14), as well as a widespread popular faith\ncapturing the imagination of common people and rulers alike.\nFigure 4.14 | Giant Buddhas\nAuthor: User \u201cWikiLaurent\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nHistorians have also hypothesized why this spread occurred. First of all, Buddhism clearly\nmet a spiritual need. During the Period of Division, turmoil from rapid political change and\nconstant warfare brought much suffering and instability to people\u2019s lives. Now, here was\na religion that explained their suffering with notions of karma and rebirth and also offered\nhope with paths to salvation and enlightenment. Buddhism placed the world amidst visions of\nmultiple hells and heavens where merciful Buddhas and Bodhisattvas worked for the salvation\nof all beings.\nBuddhism appealed to people in different ways. For scholarly elites living in capital cities\nor as hermits in mountain retreats, Buddhist doctrines about the nature of reality, self, and\nenlightenment were appealing because they seemed similar to concepts in Daoist philosophy. Both\nphilosophies questioned the reality of ordinary understandings of the self and world, emphasized\nthat our desires create an illusory world, and offered techniques for achieving liberation. Nirvana,\nfor instance, was compared to the Dao (Daoist \u201cWay\u201d).\nFor rulers, Buddhism served political purposes. Since the faith became so popular, rulers who\ntook vows and sponsored temple construction and the ordination of monks looked good because\nthey were upholding the dharma, that is, the Buddhist law. Some even went so far as to have monks\nrecognize them as incarnate Buddhas. Lastly, Buddhist monks\u2013whether foreign or Chinese\u2013were\nsome of the most educated people at their courts and could assist rulers with mundane matters,\nPage | 144 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nlike international relations, but also esoteric ones, such as spells and divination. Monks won\nsupport by promising that their rituals and incantations had magical potency.\nLastly, for most people, Buddhism was a devotional religion. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas were\nmerciful beings to be worshipped because their good karma redounded to the benefit of all beings.\nBy going to a temple and burning incense or praying and making offerings before a Buddha statue,\nthe faithful might have a simple wish granted: an illness cured, loved ones helped, or a better\nrebirth ensured.\nMap 4.15 | Expansion of Buddhism | This map shows how Buddhism spread to China and the rest of East Asia\nvia land-based routes in Central Asia and maritime routes.\nAuthor: Gunawan Kartapranata\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 145 4.11 THE TANG DYNASTY AND THE EMERGENCE OF EAST ASIA\n4.11.1 The Early Tang Dynasty\nThe Sui [sway] Dynasty did not last long (581 \u2013 618 CE) and only had two emperors: Emperor\nWen and Emperor Yang. Both envisioned recapturing the glory of the Han Dynasty; hence, they\nengaged in many construction projects and military campaigns. Immense capital cities were\nbuilt at Chang\u2019an and Luoyang and, in order to supply them with sufficient grain, a canal system\nwas created to connect the Yellow River to the Yangzi River. These emperors also believed that\nManchuria and the Korean Peninsula were properly Chinese territory; therefore, they repeatedly\nlaunched enormous military expeditions to attack the most powerful Korean kingdom located\nthere. Emperor Yang\u2019s ground and naval campaign in 611 CE, for instance, required enlisting over\none million combat troops and hundreds of thousands\nof additional men just to transport supplies. All of\nthese campaigns met defeat.\nWhat is more, that very same year, the Yellow River\nflooded, and rebellions broke out along it. Natural\ndisasters combined with these emperors\u2019 heavy\ndemands led to widespread unrest, and the Sui Dynasty\nunraveled. Bandit leaders, local officials, and local\nelites took matters into their own hands by organizing\ntheir communities for self-defense. After the emperor\ntook flight to the south, General Li Yuan [lee you-an],\nwho was stationed along the northern border to defend\nagainst the steppe nomads, marched into Chang\u2019an,\nwhere he declared the founding of the Tang Dynasty\n(618 \u2013 907 CE). Emperor Yang\u2019s life came to an end\nwhen he was assassinated by his own men.\nLike the Han Dynasty, the Tang was one of the\nmost dynamic and long-lived dynasties in China\u2019s\nhistory. That dynamism was made possible by how\neffectively early Tang rulers consolidated the empire\ninternally and then engaged in military expansion (see\nMap 4.16). Consolidating the empire required first re-\nestablishing solid political, economic, and military\nFigure 4.15 | Statue depicting a Tang institutions. Fortunately, Tang rulers could draw\nDynasty official holding a tablet with a\nupon nearly a millennium of historical experience\nreport for his superiors | Giant Buddhas\nand other revered deities in Buddhism sculpted going back to the Qin Dynasty, when a centralized\nout of the walls of caves and cliffs in Longmen, monarchical political system governing all of China\nChina beginning from the Period of Division\nwas first established. At the capital, Tang emperors\nAuthor: User \u201cEditor at Large\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons had at their disposal sophisticated ministries that in\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.5\nPage | 146 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nturn oversaw a vast provincial and county administrative system. To serve in high office, a man\nusually had to come from one of a small number of highly prestigious families with illustrious family\npedigrees. These families took pride in their superior education and manners and maintained\ntheir exclusiveness by intermarrying. Thus, the Tang Dynasty was dominated by an aristocracy.\nNevertheless, some men from a larger pool of locally prominent families entered the civil service\nbased on merit, by graduating from colleges located at the capitals or succeeding at civil service\nexaminations (see Figure 4.15).\nMap 4.16 | The Tang Dynasty at its height in 700 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nIn earlier times, empires rarely flourished without a solid agricultural foundation and revenue\nbase. To ensure sufficient grain and labor service, Tang rulers believed that land must be equitably\ndistributed to farmers. So they implemented the equal fields system. In this system, each\nfamily was to receive an equal plot of land (adjusted for terrain and productivity) for life, as well\nas a smaller plot as a permanent possession. The former was for growing grain, and the latter, for\nPage | 147 hemp and mulberry trees. In exchange, each farming family had to pay a tax in grain and cloth\nand provide twenty days of labor service. To make this work, officials carried out censuses and\nland surveys and periodically redistributed land. Of course, this system was quite onerous and\ndifficult to carry out in practice, but it did function well for about a century.\nThe Tang also flourished because special attention was paid to molding an orderly society\nthrough the promulgation of sophisticated law codes. From ancient times, in China, law was viewed\nas an expression of the will of the emperor, whose pronouncements defined illegal conduct and\nproper punishments for it. Also, law was critically important to maintaining order, not only in the\nsocial but also the natural world. Crimes committed both by subjects and the state could disturb\nthe cosmos and lead to natural disasters. Thus, law maintained social and cosmic harmony. That\nis why codes were so important.\nThe Tang Code contains twelve sections, one addressing general principles, and the rest,\nadministrative and penal law. Most of the statutes define criminal offenses and the punishment\nfor each of them. The magistrate\u2019s role, then, was primarily to investigate and determine precisely\nthe nature of the crime so that the proper punishment could be assigned. In Tang times, people\nbelieved that the severity of punishment should be based on the relative status of the perpetrator\nand victim. For instance, a crime committed against a\nfamily member was more serious than one committed\nagainst a stranger, and a crime committed against an\nofficial was more serious than one committed against a\ncommoner. Within families, too, the status of members\nmattered. Whereas a father could flog his son without\nconsequence, a son faced capital punishment should he\nbeat his father. In brief, Tang laws encoded the status\nhierarchy and values of imperial Confucianism. The\nmost serious crimes were those committed against the\nemperor, country, senior family members, and social\nsuperiors. Nevertheless, those of higher status were held\nFigure 4.16 | Relief of soldier and horse\naccountable for their actions; a magistrate who failed to\nfrom the tomb of Emperor Taizong\njustly administer the law faced punishment. In fact, Tang Author: Yen Li-pen\nmonarchs were so concerned that justice might fail to be Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nupheld that they often proclaimed amnesties, nullifying\nthe sentences of all but the worst criminals.\nLastly, Tang rulers established a formidable military. At first, the army consisted of six hundred\nmilitias stationed at headquarters located near the capitals and throughout the countryside, a\nlarge standing army located at the capital, and frontier garrisons strung out along the northern\nborder. These forces were largely maintained by drawing men from a military population. That is,\nTang rulers relied on a large number of families that maintained military traditions and provided\nsons for periods of service in lieu of paying taxes and providing labor service. As necessary, these\nmen could be assembled into expeditionary armies consisting of heavy cavalry and marching\ninfantry (see Figure 4.16).\nPage | 148 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nHaving laid these solid institutional foundations, the Tang Dynasty followed with military\nexpansion. Offensives waged to the north divided up and subdued powerful Turkic khans and\ntheir confederations of steppe nomads. Tang imperial power was then projected deep into Central\nAsia, Manchuria, and northern Vietnam, making China the most dominant country in East Asia\nin the seventh and eighth centuries.\n4.11.2 The Emergence of East Asia: The Case of Korea and Japan\nIn the introduction, we defined East Asia in both geographic and cultural terms, highlighting\nKorea and Japan. East Asia first emerges as an identifiable cultural sphere during the Tang Dynasty.\nBy Tang times, kingdoms had already emerged on the Korean Peninsula and the main islands of\nJapan, but it was during the Tang that ruling elites in both of these states made extensive efforts to\nadapt components of the Chinese political, legal, and writing system, as well as of Chinese culture,\nto their own societies.\n4.11.2.1: Korea\u2019s History from the Fourth Century BCE to 900 CE\nWe have already learned about China\u2019s history from the Han Dynasty (203 BCE \u2013 220 CE)\nthrough the Period of Division (220 \u2013 589 CE) and into the Tang Dynasty. During those same\ncenturies, the first states formed on the Korean Peninsula, and historians generally organize that\ntime into three periods: the early historical period (c. 400 BCE \u2013 313 CE), Three Kingdoms\nPeriod (313 \u2013 668 CE), and the Silla Dynasty (668 \u2013 892 CE).\nBy the fourth century BCE, the peninsula had already long been populated by peoples who\nhad migrated there from northeast Asia and settled into agricultural villages. These peoples were\nnot originally speakers of Chinese; rather, they spoke languages belonging to the Altaic language\nfamily, which possibly includes Korean. This point is important because people unfamiliar\nwith East Asia sometimes think that the languages spoken by Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, and\nVietnamese are closely related, when in fact they are quite different. However, it is also important\nto note that in ancient times throughout East Asia, the Chinese writing system was adopted by\nliterate elites for the purpose of writing their spoken languages. Only over time were native scripts\ndeveloped out of it.\nThe political picture for the early historical period is complex because the peninsula and\nneighboring Manchuria looked like a mosaic of chiefdom confederations and petty kingdoms,\neach governed by elite families living in walled towns. These polities first took shape during these\ncenturies. By the early centuries CE, three kingdoms extending from Manchuria to where Seoul\nlies today (the capital of South Korea) covered the northern half, while the southern half was\ndivided up by confederations of chiefdoms. The most powerful kingdom was Goguryeo [Ko-goo-\nryo] c. 37 BCE \u2013 668 CE).\nThe Korean peninsula lies very close to China, with only Manchuria and the Yellow Sea dividing\nthe two states. Long before Korea\u2019s early historical period, rulers of Chinese states had taken an\ninterest in controlling both trade routes leading into this region and the peoples living there. In\n108 BCE, during the Han Dynasty, Emperor Wu even sent expeditions into Manchuria and Korea.\nPage | 149 He opened up a corridor leading\nfrom China through Manchuria into\nthe peninsula and established four\ncommanderies to control the area\n(see Map 4.17).\nBut Han China by no means\ncolonized the entirety of this\nnortheastern region. Kingdoms and\ntribal confederations remained to the\neast and south, most notably Goguryeo.\nAfter the Han Dynasty collapsed,\nnorthern China was in turmoil and\nunable to control these frontiers. In\n313 CE, King Mich\u2019on of Goguryeo,\nin an effort to expand the size of his\nkingdom, seized Chinese territory.\nThat date marked the beginning of a\nnew stage in Korean history referred\nto as the Three Kingdoms period\n(313 CE \u2013 668 CE).\nThe Three Kingdoms were\nGoguryeo, Baekje [peck-jay], and\nMap 4.17 | A map of Korea during the early historical period |\nSilla [she-la] (see Map 4.18). Like\nAfter 108 BCE, Han China established commanderies in Korea. Lelang\nwas one of them and was located where the capital of North Korea\u2013 Goguryeo, the early histories of\nPyongyang\u2013is today. The most powerful neighboring kingdom was Baekje and Silla date back to the\nGoguryeo. Mahan and Jinhan were southern tribal confederations.\nearly historical period, during which\nAuthor: User \u201cHistoriographer\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons time they were consolidated from\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 southern chiefdom confederations\n(see Map 4.17). Each kingdom was\ndominated by a warrior elite composed of the ruling and aristocratic clans. For most of the Three\nKingdoms period, Goguryeo was the dominant military and political power, spreading its control\nover much of Manchuria and northern Korea. During the fifth century CE, its capital was moved\nto Pyongyang, site of a former Han Commandery. This move made this city\u2013the capital of North\nKorea today\u2013important to Korean history. Murals on Goguryeo tombs located in the vicinity show\nwhat this kingdom\u2019s elites valued (see Figure 4.17). They are depicted as heavily-clad warriors\nfighting on horseback with bows and arrows, and swords and halberds. A cosmos depicts guardian\nspirits and nature gods belonging to a native Korean tradition of shamanism.\nGiven the geopolitical position of Korea, it is not surprising that all three kingdoms highly\nvalued martial traditions. First of all, they fought with each other for control over territory and re-\nsources on the peninsula. Secondly, positioned as Korea is between China and Japan, those states\noften intruded upon peninsular conflicts. For all these reasons, Silla, Baekje, and Goguryeo mon-\nPage | 150 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\narchs readily borrowed ideas from China\nthat might benefit their realms and give\nthem more power. That borrowing in-\ncluded introducing elements of Chinese\npolitical institutions and legal traditions,\nas well as Buddhism and Confucianism.\nAll of these kingdoms sent students to\nstudy in China and patronized Chinese\nBuddhist monks and learned Confucians\nwho visited their courts. These visitors\nwere knowledgeable in many fields of\nlearning, including science and tech-\nnology. As we have seen, Buddhism not\nonly promised salvation but also magi-\ncal powers of healing, and rulers could\nstyle themselves as living Buddhas. That\nis why they sponsored the building of\ntemples and formation of a Buddhist re-\nligious order. Confucianism, on the other\nhand, provided models of civility, courtly\netiquette, and bureaucratic governance\nfor ruling elites, and rulers could style Map 4.18 | Map of the Three Kingdoms Period in Korea,\nthemselves in Chinese fashion as sover- c. sixth century CE\nAuthor: User \u201cChris 73\u201d\neign monarchs. Hence, Confucian acade-\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nmies were established to train students of License: CC BY-SA 3.0\naristocratic families for service.\nTowards the end of the Three\nKingdoms period, however, it was\nnot the great northeastern power of\nGoguryeo that unified the Korean\nPeninsula. This achievement went\nto the Silla Dynasty and did so for\ntwo reasons. First, Silla rulers were\nparticularly effective in using Chinese\npolitical practices to centralize their\npower. They adopted Chinese-style\ntitles, central government agencies,\nFigure 4.17 | Mural from a Goguryeo tomb, showing a and law codes; made Buddhism\nwarrior hunting\na state-sponsored religion; and\nAuthor: User \u201cMaksim\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons established an academy for studying\nLicense: Public Domain Chinese classical texts, law, medicine,\nPage | 151 and astronomy. Second, Silla monarchs built alliances with Tang emperors that worked to their\nadvantage. As we have seen, the Chinese Sui Dynasty fell because Sui rulers suffered terrible\ndefeats at the hands of the armies of the great kingdom of Goguryeo. Tang Dynasty rulers\ncontinued the invasions but also failed. For that reason, they were open to building alliances with\nSilla and combining their military forces. Together, they defeated Baekje in 660 and Goguryeo in\n668. Much to the Tang emperor\u2019s surprise, Silla then drove out Tang forces, preventing any efforts\non China\u2019s part to control the Korean peninsula. The Silla Dynasty (668 \u2013 892 CE) thus became\nthe first one to unify the peninsula (see Map 4.16).\nIn sum, Goguryeo and the Silla Dynasty were, in succession, two of the most powerful kingdoms\nin ancient Korea. Their histories were deeply shaped by the intrusion of Chinese states into the\nregion. For that reason, they can be categorized as instances of secondary state formation.\nThroughout history, some states developed and centralized their control over a territory largely in\nresponse to the impact of a powerful neighboring state that had developed before them. As they\ndid so, they also borrowed ideas for how states should be organized from that neighboring power,\neven as native traditions and language are retained.\n4.11.2.2 Japan from the Yayoi Period to the Seventh Century\nThose who follow the history of World War II might know that, during those years, the highest\nauthority in Japan was Emperor Hirohito. Even today, Japan has an emperor and empress, although\nthey no longer have any formal political power in this now democratic nation and rather serve in\na cultural and symbolic role. Interestingly, the Japanese monarchy is the oldest continuous one in\nthe history of the world and traces its beginnings\nto at least the fourth century CE.\nJapan\u2019s early historical development presents\nunique characteristics because of its geography.\nThe island archipelago was close enough to\nChinese and Korean states to borrow from them\nand benefit from migration and yet far enough\naway so that invasions were never a sudden\nimpetus to change (see Map 4.1). Therefore,\nalthough we can also speak of secondary state\nformation for Japan, that is largely because of\nthe conscious choice on the part of ruling elites\nto adopt political ideas and cultural patterns\nfrom China and Korea.\nBut even during the prehistoric period,\ngeography impacted Japan\u2019s development in\nother ways. The first evidence for Paleolithic Figure 4.18 | An earthenware \u201cflame pot\u201d from\nhunter-gatherers dates back to c. 30,000 BCE. In the J\u014dmon Period, dating to c. 3000 BCE\nAuthor: User \u201cMorio\u201d\nthe resource-rich environments of mountainous\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nand forested Japan, small bands of mobile, License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 152 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nFigure 4.19 | A reconstruction of Yoshinogari, a Yayoi Period chiefdom | It was located in northwest Kyushu\nand flourished c. first century BCE.\nAuthor: User \u201cSanjo\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nmulti-generational families were able to thrive on game, shellfish, fruits, tubers, and nuts. In fact,\nforaging strategies were so successful that even when sedentary village communities first formed,\nthey thrived without agriculture. This period of time is known as the J\u014dmon [joe-moan] Period\n(c. 11,000 \u2013 500 BCE). The archaeological record reveals that, up and down the archipelago,\nforagers had settled into permanent base camps. These were hamlet communities made up of\npit dwellings for homes and raised floor structures for holding community functions. J\u014dmon,\nmeaning \u201ccord-marked,\u201d refers to the type of pottery they used (see Figure 4.18). This case is one\nof the few in prehistory where a culture invented and used pottery long before farming.\nFarming began during the next stage in Japanese history\u2013the Yayoi [ya-yo-ee] Period (500\nBCE \u2013 250 CE). The label refers to a site near Tokyo where artifacts were discovered evidencing\nnew developments in Japan. Most importantly, rice-paddy agriculture and dry-field farming were\nintroduced, techniques that supported population growth and the formation of more and larger village\ncommunities. The impetus to agriculture was likely earlier experimentation with simple horticulture,\na warming climate, and migration from mainland East Asia. Those migrants also brought knowledge\nof iron- and bronze-working; hence, tools and weapons fashioned from metals became widespread.\nDuring the early centuries of Yayoi, small village communities proliferated across the main islands\nof Japan, but, during the latter half, they evolved into something more substantial. Archaeologists\nhave excavated the foundations of large settlements surrounded by moats and embankments (see\nFigure 4.19). These fortified bastions were home to up to two thousand residents and contained\nceremonial centers, differentiated residences and burials, watchtowers, and palisades. Some\nPage | 153 burials contained skeletons evidencing wounds or\ndismemberment. Combining this evidence with\nclues from contemporary Chinese historical sources,\nspecialists have concluded that, by the end of the\nYayoi period, powerful chiefdoms had emerged in\nJapan, and they were allying with and battling each\nother to control trade routes and territory.\nIn retrospect, the late Yayoi Period clearly was\na transitional phase leading to the formation of the\nfirst kingdom in Japanese history. That happened\nin the next stage, the Mounded Tomb Period\n(250 \u2013 600 CE). Among the warring chiefdoms,\none emerged as dominant. Hailing from the\nMap 4.19 | Map depicting extent of the Yamato Kinai region of Japan (see Map 4.1), Yamato\nKingdom c. seventh century CE chieftains expanded their power through force\nAuthor: User \u201cMorio\u201d\nand diplomacy, and eventually forged a kingdom\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n(see Map 4.19). The principal evidence\nfor their growing power are the massive,\nkeyhole-shaped tombs giving this period its\nname (see Figure 4.20). In fact, nearly ten\nthousand tombs have been identified, but\nthe largest ones belong to the Yamato rulers,\nthe ancestors to the long-lived Japanese\nimperial line. Although the large royal ones\nhave not yet been excavated, smaller tombs\ncontaining an abundance of horse trappings,\niron weapons, and armor provide evidence\nthat mounted warfare was introduced from\nthe Korean peninsula, perhaps accelerating\nthe pace of state formation.\nAs they conquered more territory, Yamato\nrulers devised strategies for strengthening Figure 4.20 | The Daisen Tomb in Osaka, Japan,\nc. fifth century | At 486 meters in length, this is the\ntheir monarchy and incorporating leaders of\nlargest of the keyhole tombs.

In addition, in the sixth century CE,\nPage | 154 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nYamato rulers began to study\nthe great Sui (581 \u2013 618 CE)\nand Tang (618 \u2013 907 CE)\nDynasties in China and to\nintroduce reforms based upon\nwhat they learned. The next two\ncenturies in Japanese history,\nthe Asuka-Nara Period (c.\n600 \u2013 800 CE), was defined by\nthese Chinese-style reforms,\nalthough the name itself refers\nto the successive locations of\nthe royal court.\nPrince Sh\u014dtoku [show-\nFigure 4.21 | The Grand Shrine at Ise | This Shinto Shrine was\ntoe-coo] (573 \u2013 621 CE) and\nfirst built c. fourth century CE in honor of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu,\nEmpress Suiko [sue-ee-ko] progenitor of the Japanese imperial line. According to legends, it\n(r. 593 \u2013 628) led the way by contains the Amaterasu\u2019s sacred mirror, which was handed down to the\nfirst emperors. The shrine has been rebuilt many times\nsending several embassies\nAuthor: User \u201cN yotarou\u201d\nto the capital of China and Source: Wikimedia Commons\nthen remodeling their capital License: CC BY-SA 4.0\nand court. In his \u201cSeventeen\nArticle Constitution,\u201d Sh\u014dtoku called for the introduction of Buddhism and Confucian ethics.\nHis articles, for instance, stated that the sovereign\u2019s relation to subjects was like Heaven\u2019s\nto the earth, and his or her commands should thus be obeyed. Empress Suiko adopted the\ntitle \u201cHeavenly Monarch,\u201d thus shifting the character of the monarch from a martial king to\na Chinese-style sovereign. In brief, they introduced a Confucian-oriented, emperor-centered\nstate ideology that clearly established a hierarchical system of ranks and norms for court\netiquette. For the remainder of this period, other reformers and monarchs would only deepen\nthe reforms by introducing Chinese-style law codes. These laws reshaped the government and\nland according to a bureaucratic and administrative structure very similar to that of Tang China.\nNevertheless, distinctly Japanese patterns remained throughout this time. First, the\nroyally-recognized great clans of earlier times evolved into an aristocratic class that dominated\nthe court and the upper ranks of officialdom. Secondly, in addition to establishing a council to\nmanage the growing numbers of Buddhist temples and clerics, the court established a Council\nof Kami Affairs to oversee native Japanese religious traditions. That tradition is known as\nShinto [sheen-toe], or the \u201cWay of the Kami.\u201d\nShinto began in prehistoric times as reverence for kami\u2014spirits and deities associated\nwith natural phenomena, such as the sun or moon. Really, anything mysterious might become\na kami, including a mountain, charismatic ruler, or serpent. During the Yayoi and Mounded\nTomb Periods, these kami became the subjects of myths that explained their origins and powers,\nand shrines were erected to house sacred objects symbolizing them. By properly purifying\nPage | 155 oneself, conducting rituals, and praying to a kami, an individual could avert a disaster and\nensure his own or the community\u2019s well-being. Also, clans would claim important kami as\ntheir guardian spirits and fashion stories about how their ancestors descended from them. In\nfact, Yamato monarchs claimed they were descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, and\nconstructed a shrine at Ise [ee-say] to house her kami body (see Figure 4.21). Finally, during\nthe Asuka-Nara Period, the Yamato court developed a centralized system to keep track of and\nregulate Shinto shrines throughout its realm, thereby harnessing higher powers to support its\nclaim to rule the land.\nIn sum, like Korea, Japan\u2019s history was highly impacted by developments in China, even\nas native languages, traditions, and creative adaptation remained foundational to the unique\nidentities of each. However, Korea was far more subject to the intrusion of Chinese states in the\nKorean Peninsula, something that did not happen in Japan. Rather, as the first state formed on\nthe archipelago, ruling elites looked to China for ideas as to how the kingdom might be governed.\nIn the course of doing so, they also introduced the great tradition of Mahayana Buddhism.\n4.11.3 The Decline and Collapse of the Tang Dynasty\nThe Tang Dynasty reached its zenith during the eighth century under the reign of Emperor\nXuanzong (r. 712 \u2013 756 CE), but then went into decline. At first, the problem was overexpansion.\nTang rulers had expanded the empire\u2019s boundaries in nearly every direction, including far into\nCentral Asia. To defend the northwestern border, a system of regional frontier commands was\nestablished, each with its own commander and professional army. The earlier system of militias\nand garrisons manned by hereditary military families declined.\nThis decline turned out to be dangerous. After one general, An Lushan, butted heads with the\nemperor\u2019s chief minister, he marched his frontier army of 100,000 soldiers south to the capital,\nforcing the court to flee. An was eventually executed by his own men, and a Tang emperor returned\nto the throne, but the turmoil unleashed by this rebellion rendered the Tang Dynasty ineffective.\nDuring the ensuing turmoil, the empire shrank and Central Asia was lost (see Map 4.20). Also,\nboth Tang supporters and pardoned rebels were granted military governorships, giving them\ncontrol over provinces. Many then chose not to remit tax revenue to the central government,\nappointed their own subordinates, and designated their successors. They had, in effect, become\nwarlords with their own loyal, regional bases.\nFurthermore, as the political system decentralized in this way, the system of equitable\nland distribution collapsed. Thus, much like during the end of the Han Dynasty, landlords\nused their power and influence to build great estates. Large numbers of farmers ended up\nwithout land and survived only by joining bandit gangs or the ranks of warlord armies. When\ndroughts and famine hit in the late ninth century, a massive rebellion broke out. The last\nTang emperor was turned into a puppet by military commanders and eventually, in 907 CE,\nabdicated. China then entered yet another period of division until the Song Dynasty restored\norder in 960 CE.\nPage | 156 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nMap 4.20 | The Tang Dynasty in 800 CE | Note how Tang territory had shrunk after the An Lushan rebellion.\nCentral Asia was now controlled by Tibetan and Turkic Uighur Empires\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\n4.12 THE SONG DYNASTY\nLike every Chinese dynasty before it, the Song Dynasty (960 \u2013 1279 CE) was born out of\nturmoil and warfare. After the Tang Dynasty fell, China was once again divided up by numerous,\ncontending kingdoms. The founder of the Song, Zhao Kuangyin [j-ow kwong-yeen], was a\nmilitary commander and advisor to the emperor of one of these kingdoms, but after he died and\nhis six-year-old son came to the throne, Zhao staged a coup. He left the capital with his troops,\nostensibly to fight enemies to the north. But just outside the capital, his troops instead proclaimed\nhim emperor, a title he accepted only with feigned reluctance and after his followers promised\nobedience and to treat the child emperor and people living in the capital environs humanely. On\nFebruary 3, 960, the child was forced to abdicate, and Zhao took the throne as Emperor Taizu [tie-\ndzoo]. He and his brother, the succeeding Emperor Taizong [tie-dzawng], ruled for the first forty\nyears of a dynasty that would last over three hundred, laying the foundations for its prosperity\nand cultural brilliance. The Song Dynasty saw a total of eighteen emperors and is most notable for\nPage | 157 the challenges it faced from northern conquest dynasties, economic prosperity, a civil service\nexamination system and the educated elite of scholar-officials it created, cultural brilliance,\nand footbinding.\nDuring the Song, China once again confronted tremendous challenges from conquests by\nmilitary confederations located along the northern border. So threatening and successful were\nthese that the Song Dynasty counted as just one of many powerful players in a larger geopolitical\nsystem in Central and East Asia. The first two northern conquest dynasties, the Liao [lee-ow]\nand Jin [jean], emerged on the plains of Manchuria when powerful tribal leaders organized\ncommunities of hunters, fishers, and farmers for war (see Map 4.21).\nAs their power grew, they formed states and conquered territory in northern China, forcing\nthe Chinese to pay them large subsidies of silk and silver for peace. So Chinese rulers and\ntheir councilors were in constant negotiations with peoples they viewed as culturally-inferior\nbarbarians under conditions where they were forced to treat them as equals, as opposed to weaker\nMap 4.21 | The Northern Song Dynasty in 1100 CE | Note that China (in yellow, with the capital at Kaifeng)\nwas surrounded by powerful neighbors, such as the Khitan Liao state to the north.

At first, they used a combination of defensive\nmeasures and expensive bilateral treaties, which did make for a degree of stability. But a high\nprice was exacted. Halfway through the Song, the Jin Dynasty destroyed the Liao and occupied the\nentire northern half of China, forcing the Song court to move south (see Map 4.22). To rule Chinese\npossessions, Jin rulers even took on the trappings of Chinese-style emperors and developed a dual\nadministrative system. Steppe tribes were ruled by a traditional military organization, while the\nfarming population of China was governed with Chinese-style civilian administration. The Song\nDynasty thus constantly faced the prospect of extinction and was challenged in its legitimacy by\nrival emperors claiming the right to rule the Chinese realm.\nOne reason Song monarchs were able to buy peace was the extraordinary prosperity during\ntheir rule and the resulting tax revenue made available. During those centuries, China was by many\nmeasures the most developed country in the world. In 1100 CE, the population was one hundred\nmillion, more than all of medieval Europe combined. That number doubled the population of\nMap 4.22 | China during the Southern Song Dynasty, c. 1200 CE | Another military conquest dynasty,\nthe Jin, had destroyed the Liao Dynasty and forced the Chinese emperor to relocate his capital further south,\nat Lin\u2019an.\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nPage | 159 750 CE, just three hundred years prior. The reason for such growth was flourishing agricultural\nproduction, especially rice-paddy agriculture. More drought-resistant and earlier-ripening strains\nof rice, combined with better technology, lead to higher yields per acre.\nThe impact was enormous. The productivity of farmers stimulated other industries, such\nas ironworking. Estimates place iron production at as high as twenty thousand tons per year.\nThat amount made iron prices low and, therefore, such products as spades, ploughshares, nails,\naxles, and pots and pans more cheaply available. Seeing its profitability, wealthy landowning and\nmerchant families invested in metallurgy, spurring better technology. Bellows, for instance, were\nworked by hydraulic machinery, such as water mills. Explosives derived from gunpowder were\nengineered to open mines. Similar development of textile and ceramic industries occurred.\nIndeed, during the Song, China underwent a veritable economic revolution. Improvements in\nagriculture and industry, combined with a denser population, spurred the commercialization\nof the economy. A commercialized economy is one that supports the pursuit of profit through\nproduction of specialized products for markets. A Song farmer, for instance, as opposed to just\nproducing rice to get by, might rather purchase it on a market and instead specialize in tea or\noranges. Since markets were proliferating in towns and cities and transport via land and water\nwas now readily available, farmers could rely on merchants to market their goods across the\ncountry. To support this economic activity, the government minted billions of coins each year as\nwell as the world\u2019s first paper currency.\nA denser population and sophisticated economy led to urbanization. During the Song, at a\ntime when London had roughly fifteen thousand people, China had dozens of cities with over fifty\nthousand people and capitals with a half million. Song painted scrolls show crowds of people moving\nthrough streets lined with shops, restaurants, teahouses, and guest houses (see Figure 4.22).\nFigure 4.22 | This section of a Song Dynasty period scroll depicts a bridge in Kaifeng, the first capital.\nAuthor: User \u201cZhuwq\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 160 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nTo manage their realm, Song rulers implemented a national civil service examination\nto recruit men for office. Prior dynasties had used written examinations testing knowledge of\nConfucian classics to select men for office, but only as a supplement to recommendation and\nhereditary privilege. During the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, however, aristocratic families\nthat had for centuries dominated the upper echelons of officialdom disappeared. The first Song\nemperor, Zhao Kuangyin, rode to power with the support of military men; having largely unified\nChina, he then sought to restore civil governance based in Confucian principles of humaneness\nand righteousness. So he invited senior commanders to a party and, over a cup of wine, asked them\nto relinquish their commands for a comfortable retirement. They obliged. He and his successors\nconsequently made the examination system the pre-eminent route to office, even establishing a\nnational school system to help young men prepare for and advance through it. Thus, during the\nSong Dynasty, civil offices came to be dominated by men who had spent years, even decades,\npreparing for and passing through a complex series of exams. Hence, they were both scholars and\nofficials. Success in entering this class placed a person at the pinnacle of society, guaranteeing\nthem prestige and wealth. These scholar-officials, and their Confucian worldview, dominated\nChinese society until the twentieth century.\nIn theory, since any adult male could take the examinations, the system was meritocratic.\nBut in reality, because they were so difficult and quotas were set, very few actually passed them.\nEstimates suggest that only one in one hundred passed the lowest level exam. This ratio meant\nthat, in order to succeed, a young man had to begin memorizing long classical texts as a child\nand to continue his studies until he passed or gave up hope. Only affluent families could afford to\nsupport such an education.\nNevertheless, the meritocratic ideal inspired people from all classes to try and so promoted literacy\nand a literary revival during the Song Dynasty. As a part of this revival and to provide a curriculum\nfor education, scholar-officials sought to reinvigorate Confucianism. The philosophical movement\nthey began is known as Neo-Confucianism. By the Song Dynasty, whereas Confucianism largely\nshaped personal behavior and social mores, Buddhist and Daoist explanations of the cosmos,\nhuman nature, and the human predicament dominated the individual\u2019s spiritual outlook. Neo-\nConfucians responded to this challenge by providing a metaphysical basis for Confucian morality\nand governance. Zhu Xi (1130 \u2013 1200), arguably the most important philosopher in later imperial\nChinese history, produced a grand synthesis that would shape the worldview of the scholar-official\nclass. He argued that the cosmos consists of a duality of principles and a material force composing\nphysical things. One principle underlies the cosmos and individual principles provide the abstract\nreason for individual things. In human beings, principle manifests as human nature, which is wholly\ngood and the origins of the human capacity to become moral persons. However, an individual\u2019s\nphysical endowment obscures their good nature and leads to moral failings, which is why a rigorous\nConfucian curriculum of moral self-cultivation based in classical texts like Confucius\u2019 Analects is\nnecessary. Most importantly, Zhu Xi argued, individual morality was the starting point for producing\na well-managed family, orderly government, and peace throughout the world.\nFurthermore, during the Song Dynasty, moveable-type printing also began to be widely used,\ncontributing to an increase in literacy and broader exposure to these new ideas. Chinese characters\nPage | 161 were carved on wood blocks, which were\nthen arranged in boxes that could be\ndipped in ink and printed on paper (see\nFigure 4.23). Books on a multitude of\ntopics\u2013especially classics and histories\u2013\nbecame cheaply and widely available,\nfueling a cultural efflorescence at a time\nwhen education had become paramount\nto climbing the social ladder. Other\ninventions that made China one of the\nmost technologically innovative during\nthis time include gunpowder weapons (see\nFigure 4.24) and the mariner\u2019s compass.\nFigure 4.23 | A woodblock used to print one page of\nLooked at from many angles, then,\nclassical Chinese | The characters read from top to bottom\nthe Song was truly a dynamic period in and right to left.

Scholars believe footbinding\nbegan among professional dancers in the tenth century and was then adopted by the upper classes.\nOver time it spread to the rest of Chinese society, only to end in the twentieth century. At a young age,\na girl\u2019s feet would be wrapped tightly with bandages so that they couldn\u2019t grow, ideally remaining\nabout four-inches long. That stunting made walking very difficult and largely kept women confined\nto their homes. Eventually, the bound foot, encased in an embroidered silk slipper, became a symbol\nFigure 4.24 | Buddhist scroll (c. 950)\nshowing demons threatening the\nBuddha with a bomb and fire lance |\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, alchemists\nattempting to produce an elixir of\nimmortality accidentally invented gunpowder\nwhen experimenting with saltpeter, sulfur,\nand charcoal.

Whereas men dominated\npublic realms like government and\nbusiness, women married at a young age\nand lived out most of their lives in the\ndomestic sphere. Indeed, in earlier times,\nChina was patriarchal, patrilineal, and\npatrilocal. It was patriarchal because the\nlaw upheld the authority of senior males\nin the household and patrilineal because\nFigure 4.25 | Silk slipper for a bound foot, dating to a\none\u2019s surname and family property passed\nlater Chinese dynasty.\ndown the male line\u2014though a wife did Author: User \u201cVassil\u201d\nhave control over her dowry. Importantly, Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC0 1.0\nancestor worship, the pre-eminent social\nand religious practice in Chinese society,\nwas directed toward patrilineal forbears.\nThat is why it was important for the\nwoman to move into the spouse\u2019s home,\nwhere she would live together with her\nparents-in-law. Patrilocal describes this\ntype of social pattern. Marriages were\nalmost always arranged for the benefit of\nboth families involved, and, during the\nwedding ceremony, the bride was taken in\na curtained sedan chair to the husband\u2019s\nhome where she was to promise to obey her\nparents-in-law and then bow along with\nher husband before the ancestral altar.\nIdeally, she would become a competent\nhousehold manager, educate the children,\nand demonstrate much restraint and\nother excellent interpersonal skills.\nAlthough gender hierarchy was,\ntherefore, the norm, other scholars have\nobserved that ideals were not always Figure 4.26 | Painting of ladies at the Song court\npreparing silk.\nreality and women did exercise their\nAuthor: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\nagency within the boundaries placed Source: Wikimedia Commons\nupon them.

Song literature further reveals\nthat women were often in the fields\nworking or out on city streets shopping.\nAmong the upper classes, literacy and\nthe ability to compose essays or poetry\nmade a woman more marriageable. For\nthis reason, some women were able to\nexcel. Li Qingzhao [lee ching-jow] (c.\n1084 \u2013 1155) is one of China\u2019s greatest\npoets (see Figure 4.27). She came from\na prestigious scholar-official family. Her\nfather was both a statesman and classical\nscholar, and her mother was known for\nher literary achievements. In her teens,\nLi began to compose poetry, and, over\nthe course of her life, she produced many\nvolumes of essays and poems. Poems to\nher husband even suggest mutual love\nand respect and treating her as an equal.\nIn fact, throughout Chinese history, it\nwas not unusual for women to challenge\nand transgress boundaries. At the highest\nFigure 4.27 | A modern statue of Li Qingzhao placed in\na museum built in her honor. | The museum is located in level, during both the Han and Tang\nJinan, China, her hometown.

Like\nearlier neighbors lying to the north of the Song, the Yuan was also a northern conquest dynasty. The\nkey players here were steppe nomads living on the grasslands of Mongolia, known as Mongols, and\ntheir leader Genghis Khan. The story of their rise and how they created the largest territorial empire\nin the history of the world properly belongs to Chapter Eleven, which covers Central Asia, so we here\nonly provide a brief introduction. The most important point to bear in mind is that the Mongols\nconquered many countries, including China, and incorporated them into a large Eurasian empire.\nIn the twelfth century CE, the Mongols were one of many tribes of nomadic pastoralists living\non the steppes of Central Asia. Although these tribes were made up of peoples of differing ethnicity,\nPage | 164 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\nthey held in common a way of life. Since the steppe was unsuited to farming, they relied principally\non their herds, but also on what they could obtain by trading with neighboring sedentary peoples.\nThe nomads lived in temporary campsites, periodically breaking down their yurts and relocating\nas the seasons required. Since the tribes often fought with each other or turned to raiding, nomads\nwere also excellent at mounted warfare. Their chieftain leaders\u2013referred to as khans\u2013were usually\nselected based on skill in battle and charisma.\nUndoubtedly, the most famous khan in Central Asian history is Genghis Khan. In the late twelfth\ncentury, he accrued an army of loyal followers and began to subdue tribes across the Mongolian\nsteppe. In 1206 CE, at a gathering of tribal leaders, he was proclaimed Universal Khan of a tribal\nconfederation. Using a powerful military with a tight command structure, Genghis proceeded to\nunleash a wave of campaigning in northern China and Central Asia, thereby adding much territory\nto a growing Mongol Empire (see Map 4.23). After he died in 1227 CE, this empire was divided into\nfour khanates, each of which went to one of his four sons as their territorial inheritance.\nTolui, Genghis Khan\u2019s youngest son, was granted the Mongol homeland as well as subjugated\nterritory in northern China held by the Jin Dynasty. But this rugged warrior died in 1232 at the young\nMap 4.23 | Map of Mongol Empire as it expanded during the first waves of conquests, from 1207-1225 |\nDuring this first wave, not the Song Dynasty but its northern neighbor, the Jin Dynasty, was attacked\nAuthor: User \u201cBkkbrad\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 165 age of forty, so the task of managing Chinese territory fell to\nTolui\u2019s capable wife Sorghagtani Beki and her second son,\nKublai Khan (1215 \u2013 1294 CE). Unlike his predecessors,\nwho largely treated Chinese as chattel and ruthlessly\nexploited their towns and villages, Kublai saw the advantages\nof taking a more enlightened approach. With the advice of\nChinese advisors, he adopted Chinese-style methods for\ngoverning China. In fact, after Kublai was elected as the fifth\nUniversal Khan in 1260, he chose to move his capital from\nMongolia to Beijing, making it the center of his khanate. He\nthen took on the trappings of a Chinese-style sovereign and,\nin 1273, declared the founding of the Great Yuan Dynasty.\nAccordingly, he asserted that the Mandate of Heaven had\nbeen transferred to him from the Song Dynasty.\nKublai then engaged in a decade of conquest that\nFigure 4.28 | Portrait of Kublai Khan\nconcluded with the fall of the Song. This victory over the\nAuthor: User \u201cYaan\u201d\nSong Dynasty, China required careful preparation. The Source: Wikimedia Commons\nSong was located in the southern two-thirds of China, License: Public Domain\nwhere the terrain was matted with lakes, rivers, and canals.\nThe Mongols had little experience with naval warfare, so they turned to Chinese advisors to build\na navy. Mongol cavalry boarded the ships and floated down rivers leading to the Song capital,\nlaying siege to cities along the way. When they reached it in 1276, Kublai\u2019s generals took the\ncapital without bloodshed. The regent to the young\nSong emperor worked out conditions for surrender\nto them. Hence, the Mongol Yuan Dynasty had won\ncontrol over China. After Kublai died, nine of his\ndescendants ruled as emperors until the dynasty fell\nto native rebellions in 1368.\nHistorians differently assess the impact of\nMongol Yuan rule on China. Earlier generations of\nhistorians judged that violent Mongol conquests\ndevastated the land and led to a population drop.\nThe Mongol style of rule was despotic. Rather than\nsustain the openness of Chinese society and use the\nmerit-based examination system to bring talent into\ntheir government, Mongol rulers placed Chinese\nin rigid occupational categories and suspended the\nFigure 4.29 | Blue and white porcelain plate exams. Many capable men simply avoided official\nmanufactured during the Yuan Dynasty service and turned to other professions.\nAuthor: User \u201cYaan\u201d\nRecent studies, however, offer a more positive\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain assessment. Because Yuan rulers followed the\nPage | 166 CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY\ncounsel of Confucian advisors and adopted traditional Chinese methods for governing, for\nmost Chinese life went on as before. Early on, much attention was also paid to the farming\npopulation. To promote agriculture, Yuan rulers provided relief measures and promoted the\nformation of rural cooperatives. Also, Mongols highly valued crafts and implemented policies\nthat greatly benefited artisans and promoted their work. Hence, arts such as textiles and ceramics\nflourished (see Figure 4.28). Finally, the assessment of Yuan rule in China should be linked to a\nbroader assessment of the impact of Mongol rule on world history (see Chapter Eleven). While\nduly acknowledging the devastation caused by Mongol conquests, historians also find much merit\nin Mongol patronage of arts and support for constructions projects and advancements in the areas\nof medicine and astronomy. Most importantly, the massive Eurasian empire they forged initiated\na new era of trade and contacts between Europe and China, as well as the regions lying between.\n4.14 CONCLUSION\nWe have now passed through nearly four millennia of East Asian history. We prefaced that history\nwith the development of Neolithic cultures leading up to the second millennium BCE, at which point\nthe first kingdoms in Chinese history emerged. Longshan culture (3000 \u2013 1900 BCE) consisted of\ncompeting chiefdoms that laid the foundations for the emergence of the first major states.\nThe first major state was the Xia Dynasty (c. 1900 \u2013 1600 BCE). Although historians debate\nwhether or not it was legendary and lack written sources from that time, the archaeological\nevidence points to a Bronze Age civilization with a capital city at Erlitou. The next dynasty, the\nShang (c. 1600 \u2013 1046 BCE), brings us into history proper, because we have written evidence in\nthe form of oracle bones and bronze inscriptions. The last Shang capital was located at Anyang\non the North China Plain near the Yellow River. The dynasty\u2019s most important legacies were the\nearliest form of Chinese writing and ancestor worship. The oracle bones were used to divine the\nwill of higher powers and the spirits of deceased Shang kings.\nThe next dynasty, the Zhou Dynasty (1045 \u2013 256 BCE), began when chieftains to the west of\nthe Shang declared themselves kings and overthrew it. They justified doing so with the Mandate\nof Heaven, which states that a higher power withdraws its support from corrupt ruling families\nand transfers it to righteous ones. Because it lasted eight hundred years and saw much change,\nthe Zhou is divided into two major periods, the Western (1045 \u2013 771 BCE) and Eastern Zhou\n(770 \u2013 256 BCE). During the Western Zhou, Zhou kings ruled by granting land and noble titles\nto kinsmen and allies in exchange for loyalty and service. The resulting political system, which\nsaw China divided up by over one hundred feudal states, is known as Zhou feudalism. During the\nEastern Zhou, this nobility became increasingly independent and fought with each other for power\nand territory. A few declared themselves kings and forged powerful militaries by gearing their\nkingdoms for war. In the end, in 221 BCE, the state of Qin prevailed, initiating China\u2019s imperial\nera. Also, in the midst of the dislocation caused by Eastern Zhou instability, three of China\u2019s major\nphilosophical traditions emerged: Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism.\nThe short-lived Qin Dynasty was followed by the much longer lasting Han Dynasty (202 BCE\n\u2013 220 CE). During the Han Dynasty, Confucianism was adopted as the governing philosophy and\nPage | 167 also penetrated society, shaping the Chinese worldview. The Han also became an empire, as borders\nwere expanded in all directions. During the reign of Emperor Wu (141 \u2013 87 BCE), China extended\ncontrol over parts of Korea, northern Vietnam, and also much of Central Asia. The resulting stability\nand the productivity of the economy spurred the development of the Silk Routes.\nAfter the Han dynasty fell, China was divided up by independent, short-lived kingdoms until\n589 CE, when the Sui Dynasty reunited most of the territory once controlled by the Han. Thus,\nfor four centuries, during what is known as the Period of Division (220 \u2013 589 CE), China was\npolitically unstable and racked by endemic warfare. Yet, in spite of the violence, these centuries\nalso saw vibrant cultural developments, as Buddhism became an organized institutional religion\nreshaping the spiritual landscape.\nThe Tang Dynasty (618 \u2013 907 CE) was yet another long-lived one in Chinese history. Tang\nrulers built an empire on the foundations of solid political and legal institutions, agricultural\npolicy, and a formidable military. Also during the Tang Dynasty, East Asia first emerged as an\nidentifiable cultural sphere. By Tang times, kingdoms had already formed on the Korean Peninsula\nand the main islands of Japan, but it was during the Tang that ruling elites in both of these states\nmade extensive efforts to adapt components of the Chinese political, legal, and writing system, as\nwell as of Chinese culture, to their own societies. During the seventh century CE, the Silla Dynasty\nunified the Korean Peninsula, and the Yamato heavenly sovereigns unified much of Japan. Two\nother unique East Asian civilizations had taken shape.\nThe last major dynasty surveyed was the Song Dynasty (960 \u2013 1279 CE), one that is notable\nfor the challenges it faced from northern conquest dynasties, its economic prosperity, and the\ncivil service examination system and the educated elite of scholar-officials it created. Also, since\nfootbinding developed during the Song, we considered the status of women in Chinese society,\nwhere gender hierarchy was the norm.\nThe Song Dynasty ended with Mongol conquests in 1279 CE. The Mongol Yuan Dynasty made\nChina one part of a much larger Eurasian territorial empire. Mongol ruled lasted until 1368 CE,\nwhen native rebellions overthrew a faltering Yuan state, initiating a new period in Chinese history:\nthe Ming Dynasty. This dynasty properly belongs to early modern history.\n4.15 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBarnes, Gina L. State Formation in Japan: Emergence of a 4th Century Ruling Elite.

Most of what happened at the party stayed at the party, but what we do\nknow is that it must have been a good one. One of the guests, presumably operating under the\ninfluence of his host\u2019s excellent wine, took the liberty of scratching the following ditty onto one of\nhis host\u2019s fine exported ceramic wine cups: \u201cI am the Cup of Nestor, good to drink from. Whoever\ndrinks from this cup, straightaway the desire of beautifully-crowned Aphrodite will seize him.\u201d\nWhile party pranks do not commonly make history, this one has: this so-called Cup of Nestor\nis one of the earliest examples of writing in the Greek alphabet, as well as the earliest known\nwritten reference to the Homeric epics. Overall, this cup and the inscription on it exemplify the\nmobility of the Ancient Greeks and their borrowing of skills and culture from others around the\nMediterranean while, at the same time, cultivating a set of values specific to themselves. After all,\njust like the very residents of Pithekoussai, the cup had originally made the journey all the way\nfrom the island of Euboea, off the coast of Athens, to Pithekoussai, on the island of Ischia.\nFurthermore, the new script, in which the daring guest wrote on the cup, had just recently been\nborrowed and adapted by the Greeks from the Phoenicians, a seafaring nation based in modern-\nPage | 171 Figure 5.1a | \u201cThe Cup of Nestor\u201d | Pythekoussai Figure 5.1b | \u201cThe Cup of Nestor\u201d | Detailed\nthis so-called Cup of Nestor is one of the earliest reconstruction of the inscription.\nexamples of writing in the Greek alphabet, as well as the Author: User \u201cDbachmann\u201d\nearliest known written reference to the Homeric epics.

Indeed, our clever poet wrote from right to left, just like the Phoenicians. Finally,\nthe poem mentions Nestor, one of the heroes of Homer\u2019s Iliad, an epic about the Trojan War,\nand a source of common values that all Greeks held dear: military valor, competitive excellence on\nboth the battlefield and in all areas of everyday life, and a sense of brotherhood that manifested\nitself most obviously in the shared language of all the Greeks. That feeling of kinship facilitated\ncollaboration of all the Greeks in times of crisis from the mythical Trojan War to the Persian\nWars, and finally, during the Greeks\u2019 resistance against the Roman conquest.\nMap 5.1 | Map of the\nIsland of Ischia and the\nEnvirons | The \u201cCup of\nNestor\u201d journeyed from\nthe island of Euboea, off\nthe coast of Athens, to\nPithekoussai, on the island\nof Ischia.\nAuthor: User \u201cNorman Eistein\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 172 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\n5.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

While Greece is a unified\ncountry today, the territory of the present-day country was not unified under one rule until the\nrise of the Macedonians in the fourth century BCE. Instead, the basic unit of organization in the\nperiod covered in this chapter was the polis, an independent city-state, which consisted of a\nwalled city that controlled and protected the farmland around it. Historians estimate that close to\n1,500 of these city-states dotted the ancient Greek landscape.\nEach of these poleis (plural form of polis) possessed its own form of government, law-code,\narmy, cults of patron gods, and overall culture that set it apart from the other city-states. While\nthe two most famous poleis, Athens and Sparta, controlled vast territories of farmland, most\ncity-states were quite small, with a population of just a few thousand citizens. Furthermore, the\nGreek world in antiquity encompassed much more than present-day Greece, extending as far as\nItaly in the West and the territories of modern-day Turkey and Ukraine in the East.\nThe geography and topography of the Greek mainland and the Mediterranean region\nsurrounding it influenced the history of the Greek people in a number of crucial ways. First, the\nmountainous nature of mainland Greece, especially in the north, allowed different regions to remain\nsomewhat isolated. The most isolated of all, Thessaly and Macedon, were viewed as uncivilized\nbarbarians by the rest of the Greeks in the Archaic and Classical periods (one oft-mentioned\nexample of their \u201cbarbarism\u201d in Greek literature is that they drank their wine undiluted!)and\nlargely kept to themselves until their rise to military prominence in the mid-fourth century BCE.\nThe mountains throughout the northern portion of mainland Greece, in addition to isolating\nregions from each other and promoting regional culture, also provided tactical defenses in the\nface of external attacks. Most famously, the Persians learned the hard way about the challenges of\nnavigating the Greek landscape during the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BCE. Indeed,\nthe story of the 300 Spartans who fought to the death at the Battle of Thermopylae addresses\nthe challenge of the Persian army trying to cross the mountains to the north of Attica in order to\ninvade Athens by land.\nThe Isthmus, a narrow strip of land controlled by Corinth, played a similar role in separating\nmainland Greece from the large peninsula of the Peloponnese. An inland city in southern\nPage | 175 Map 5.2 | Map of the Ancient Greek city-states at the beginning of the Persian Wars | Historians estimate that\nclose to 1,500 of these city-states dotted the ancient Greek landscape.\nAuthor: User \u201cBibi Saint-Poi\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPeloponnese, Sparta conquered Messenia, its surrounding region, early in its history and\nextended political control over much of the peninsula by early fifth century BCE. Unless the\ninterests of Sparta herself were directly involved, Sparta practiced a policy of isolation and limited\nmilitary intervention in other city-states affairs and wars, a practice enabled due to Sparta\u2019s far\nsouthern location in Peloponnese.\nNo less influential for the history of the Greek city-states than the topographical features were the\nresources that the land in different regions provided for agriculture and manufacturing. Mainland\nGreece was notoriously unsuitable for agriculture. Growing the grain staples wheat and barley in the\nrocky and clay-filled soil of Athens was especially difficult, while the mountainous regions across the\nentire mainland were optimal for herding, rather than agriculture. One notable exception, however,\nPage | 176 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nwere olive trees, which grew abundantly.\nOlive oil, as a result, was ubiquitously used\nfor eating, bathing, and lamps, and even\nas currency or prize for victors in athletic\ngames. In addition, early on in their history,\nthe inhabitants of Attica and Corinth found\na way to profit from the clay in their soil by\ndeveloping advanced ceramic pot-making and\ndecorating techniques. Remains of Athenian\nand Corinthian wares have been found at\narchaeological sites all over the Mediterranean,\nattesting to their popularity abroad.

The Aegean is filled with islands, some of which remained autonomous,\nbut most came under the control of the Athenian maritime empire in the fifth century BCE. In\naddition, the Greek colonization movement of the seventh and sixth centuries BCE resulted\nin the foundation of numerous Greek city-states in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), Magna\nGraecia (southern Italy), Sicily, and the Black Sea littoral.\nThe history of the Greek world from its earliest settlements to the Roman conquest, therefore,\nis inextricably tied together with the history of the Mediterranean as a whole. And since the Greek\nareas of influence overlapped with those controlled by the Phoenicians, Persians, and eventually\nthe Romans, interactions, often warlike, were unavoidable as well. As the modern historians\nPeregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell noted, the Mediterranean was \u201cthe Corrupting Sea\u201d1whose\ninhabitants were like frogs around the pond, watching each other, and borrowing each other\u2019s\ncultural and technological achievements. As this chapter and the next will show, the Greeks and\nthe Romans were the farthest-leaping frogs of all.\n5.6 PERIODS OF GREEK HISTORY\nHistorians today separate Greek history into particular periods, which shared specific features\nthroughout the Greek world:\nThe Bronze Age (c. 3,300 \u2013 1,150 BCE) \u2013 a period characterized by the use of bronze\ntools and weapons. In addition, two particular periods during the Bronze Age are crucial in the\ndevelopment of early Greece: the Minoan Age on the island of Crete (c. 2,000 \u2013 1,450 BCE) and\nthe Mycenean period on mainland Greece (c. 1,600 \u2013 1,100 BCE), both of them characterized\nby massive palaces, remnants of which still proudly stand today. The Minoan and Mycenaean\ncivilizations had writing (dubbed Linear A and Linear B, respectively), which they used for\nkeeping lists and palace inventories.\nThe Dark Ages (c. 1,100 \u2013 700 BCE) \u2013 a period that is \u201cdark\u201d from the archaeological\nperspective, which means that the monumental palaces of the Mycenean period disappear, and the\narchaeological record reveals a general poverty and loss of culture throughout the Greek world. For\ninstance, the Linear A and Linear B writing systems disappear. The Greeks do not rediscover writing\nuntil the invention of the Greek alphabet at the end of the Dark Ages or the early Archaic Period.\nArchaic Period (c. 700 \u2013 480 BCE) \u2013 the earliest period for which written evidence survives;\nthis is the age of the rise of the Greek city-states, colonization, and the Persian Wars.\nClassical Period (c. 480 \u2013 323 BCE) \u2013 the period from the end of the Persian Wars to the\ndeath of Alexander the Great. One of the most important events during this period is the\nPeloponnesian War (431 \u2013 404 BCE), which pitted Athens against Sparta, and forced all other Greek\ncity-states to choose to join one side or the other. This period ends with the death of Alexander the\nGreat, who had unified the Greek world into a large kingdom with himself at its helm.\nHellenistic Period (323 \u2013 146 BCE) \u2013 the period from the death of Alexander to the\nRoman conquest of Greece; this is the age of the Hellenistic monarchies ruling over territories\npreviously conquered by Alexander and his generals. Some historians end this period in 30\n1 Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000).\nPage | 178 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nBCE, with the death of Cleopatra VII, the last surviving ruler of Egypt who was a descendant\nof one of Alexander\u2019s generals.\nThe rest of this chapter will be devoted to examining each of these periods in greater detail,\ncovering chief political, military, and cultural developments.\n5.7 METHODOLOGY: SOURCES AND PROBLEM\nBefore launching into the story of the early Greek world, it is important to consider the\nmethodology that Greek historians utilize. In other words, how do we know what we know about\nthe Greek world? Modern scholars of ancient history are notoriously obsessed with evaluating\ntheir primary sources critically, and with good reason. Studying Greek history, especially in its\nearliest periods, is like putting together a puzzle, most of whose pieces are missing, and some\npieces from another puzzle have also been added in for good measure. Greek history requires\ncareful consideration of a wide range of sources, which fall into two broad categories: literary\nsources (including both fiction and non-fiction), and material culture. The job of the historian,\nthen, is to reconstruct the story of the Greek people using these very different sources.\nWhile historians of the modern world rely on such archival sources as newspapers, magazines,\nand personal diaries and correspondence of individuals and groups, historians of the ancient\nworld must use every available source to reconstruct the world in which their subject dwelled.\nLiterary sources, such as epics, lyric poetry, and drama, may seem strange for historians to use,\nas they do not necessarily describe specific historical events. Yet, as in the case of other early\ncivilizations, such sources are a crucial window into the culture and values of the people who\nproduced them. For instance, the Epic of Gilgamesh, discussed in Chapter 2, is a key text for the\nstudy of early Mesopotamia.\nThe earliest literary sources for Greek history are the Homeric epics, Iliad and Odyssey. They\nare, however, one of the most challenging sources to interpret, with one modern historian dubbing\nthem a \u201chistorian\u2019s headache.\u201d2 Composed orally before the existence of the Greek alphabet, the\nepics were not written down until sometime in the sixth century BCE. The epics most likely do\nnot reflect the society of any particular Greek city-state in any one period, but rather consist of an\namalgam of features from the Bronze Age to the early Archaic Period. Their value for historians,\nas a result, rests more on their impact on subsequent Greek culture, rather than on their providing\ninformation about Bronze Age Greeks. More than any other literary source, the Homeric Epics\ninfluenced the mentality of the Greeks in thinking about war and what it means to be a hero.\nMost other literary sources from the Archaic and Classical periods are easier to interpret than\nthe Homeric Epics, as we often can date these later sources more precisely and thus know the\nperiod whose values or problems they reflect. There is, however, one important limitation to keep\nin mind: the overwhelming majority of surviving literature is from Athens, with very few sources\nfrom other city-states. Some of this distribution of evidence has to do with the differing values of\nthe city-states themselves. For example, while Greeks of the Classical period considered Sparta to\n2 Kurt Raaflaub, \u201cA Historian\u2019s Deadache: How to Read \u2018Homeric Society\u2019?\u201d in N. Fisher and H. Van wees eds., Archaic\nGreece: New Approaches and New Evidence (London: Duckworth: 1998).\nPage | 179 be as great a city as Athens, Spartans valued military valor over all else, so they did not cultivate\narts and letters the way Athenians did. As a result, the only literary sources from Sparta are the\nworks of two poets, Alcman and Tyrtaeus. Tyrtaeus\u2019 military elegies, like the Homeric epics,\nglorify heroic death in battle over life without honor and were likely sung by Spartan warriors as\nthey marched into battle.\nSeveral genres of non-fiction survive as well, allowing historians to study specific events and\nproblems in the history of the Greek world, and especially Athens. The works of three major\nhistorians survive from Classical Athens. Herodotus, dubbed the Father of History, wrote the\nHistories about the Persian Wars in mid-fifth century BCE. Thucydides, an Athenian general in\nthe Peloponnesian War, wrote a history of the Peloponnesian War over the course of the war (431\n\u2013 404 BCE). Finally, Xenophon wrote a history of the end of the Peloponnesian War, starting with\n411 BCE, where Thucydides\u2019 work ended, and into the fourth century. In addition to the works of the\nhistorians, philosophical treatises \u2013 most notably, those of Plato and Aristotle \u2013 provide crucial\ninsight into the political thought, moral values, and perceptions of the world in late fifth and fourth\ncenturies BCE. The approximately 100 surviving courtroom speeches from the same period likewise\nprovide us with a window into the Athenian legal system. Finally, the Hippocratic corpus, a series\nof medical treatises and physicians\u2019 journals from the Classical period, help us to understand the\nGreeks\u2019 views of the human body and diseases. But in addition to the geographical restrictions of\nthese sources, which largely document Athens, it is also important to note two other key limitations\nof the available evidence. First, virtually all of the literary sources were written by men and provide\nvery little evidence of the lives and perspectives of women in the Greek world, except as seen through\nthe eyes of men. Second, most of the authors were wealthy and socially prominent individuals; thus,\ntheir perspective does not reflect that of less affluent citizens and slaves.\nArchaeological evidence\nthankfully allows historians to fill\nsome of the gaps in the literary\nevidence, but also comes with\nproblems of its own. One joke\nthat refers to the optimism of\narchaeologists reflects some of\nthese problems of interpretation:\nwhenever an archaeologist finds\nthree stones that are together, he\nlabels the find as a Minoan palace.\nWhenever he finds two stones\nthat are together, he thinks he has\nfound a city wall. Whenever he\nFigure 5.3 | Megara Hyblaea, main road, looking north | The\nfinds one building stone, he thinks careful planning of the road and the buildings is still evident, as the\nhe has found a house. ruins on both sides of the road are perfectly aligned.\nAuthor: User \u201cAlun Salt\u201d\nStill, archaeological sources\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nprovide us with key information License: CC BY-SA 2.0\nPage | 180 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nabout different aspects of everyday\nlife in different city-states. For\nexample, the excavations of the\nsixth-century BCE colony Megara\nHyblaea in Sicily shows that\nGreek colonists were interested\nin city planning and in equality of\ncitizens, as demonstrated by the\nequal size of the lots.\nMaterial finds, such as pottery\nremains, in different sites across\nthe Mediterranean also allow\nhistorians to map trading routes\nFigure 5.4 | Attic Black-Figure Hydria, c. 520 BCE | Shows \u2013 for instance, Figures 5.1 and\nwomen getting water from a public fountain.\n5.2 show vases that were made in\nAuthor: User \u201cJastrow\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons Euboea and Corinth respectively,\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.5 but were found in Greek colonies\nin Italy. In addition, images on\npottery provide information about stories and myths that have entered popular culture and\nthat sometimes reflect further aspects of everyday life. For instance, the prevalence of images\nof women gathering at public fountains on Athenian hydriae (water pots) from the late sixth\ncentury BCE shows the importance of the public fountains for the social life of women in Athens\nin the period.\nFinally, written archaeological\nsources, such as inscriptions on\nstone or pottery shards from all over\nthe Greek world, and papyri from\nHellenistic Egypt, are the equivalent\nof documentary archives from the\nancient world. The evidence from\nepigraphy (inscriptions) includes\nlaws that were written on large\nstones and set up in public, such\nas the monumental law-code from\nGortyn, Crete, and lists of war-dead,\nas well as private tomb inscriptions.\nPapyri, on the other hand,\ninclude such private documents as Figure 5.5 | The Gortyn Code (c. fifth century BCE) | Close-up\nprenuptial agreements (among the of part of the inscription.\nAuthor: User \u201cAfrank99\u201d\nstrangest are prenuptial documents\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nfor brother-sister marriages \u2013 legal License: CC BY-SA 2.5\nPage | 181 in Egypt but nowhere else in the Greek world), divorce documents, loans, and village police reports\n(cattle theft appears to have been a serious problem in the Faiyum in the Hellenistic Period!).\nTaken together, the literary and archaeological sources allow the historian to complete much\nmore of the puzzle than would have been possible with just one of these types of sources. Still,\nsignificant gaps in knowledge remain nevertheless, and are, perhaps, one of the joys of studying\nancient history: the historian gets to play the part of a sleuth, attempting to reconstruct the history\nof events based on just a few available clues.\n5.8 FROM MYTHOLOGY TO HISTORY\nThe terms \u201cmythology\u201d and \u201chistory\u201d may seem, by modern definitions, to be antithetical.\nAfter all, mythology refers to stories that are clearly false, of long-forgotten gods and heroes and\ntheir miraculous feats. History, on the other hand, refers to actual events that involved real people.\nAnd yet, the idea that the two are opposites would have seemed baffling to a typical resident of the\nancient Mediterranean world. Rather, gods and myths were part of the everyday life, and historical\nevents could become subsumed by myths just as easily as myths could become a part of history.\nFor instance, Gilgamesh, the hero of the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, was a real king of Uruk,\nyet he also became the hero of the epic. Each Greek city-state, in particular, had a foundation\nmyth describing its origins as well as its own patron gods and goddesses. Etiological myths,\nfurthermore, served to explain why certain institutions or practices existed; for instance, the tragic\ntrilogy Oresteia of the Athenian poet Aeschylus tells the etiological myth for the establishment of\nthe Athenian murder courts in the Classical period.\nYet, while the Greeks saw mythology and history as related concepts and sometimes as two\nsides of the same coin, one specific mythical event marked, in the eyes of the earliest known Greek\nhistorians, the beginning of the story of Greek-speaking peoples. That event was the Trojan War.\n5.8.1 Homer and the Trojan War\nIt is telling that the two earliest Greek historians, Herodotus, writing in the mid-fifth century\nBCE, and Thucydides, writing in the last third of the fifth century BCE, began their respective\nhistories with the Trojan War, each treating it as a historical event. The Homeric epics Iliad\nand Odyssey portray the war as an organized attack of a unified Greek army against Troy, a\ncity in Asia Minor (see map 5.2). The instigating offense? The Trojan prince Paris kidnapped\nHelen, the most beautiful woman in the world, from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. This\noffense, interpreted as a slight to Menelaus\u2019 honor, prompted Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and\nMenelaus\u2019 brother, to raise an army from the entire Greek world and sail to Troy. The mythical\ntradition had it that after a brutal ten-year siege, the Greeks resorted to a trick: they presented the\nTrojans with a hollow wooden horse, filled with armed soldiers. The Trojans tragically accepted\nthe gift, ostensibly intended as a dedication to the goddess Athena. That same night, the armed\ncontingent emerged from the horse, and the city finally fell to the Greeks. Picking up the story ten\nyears after the end of the Trojan War, the Odyssey then told the story of Odysseus\u2019s struggles to\nPage | 182 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nreturn home after the war and the changes that reverberated throughout the Greek world after\nthe fall of Troy.\nThe Homeric epics were the foundation of Greek education in the Archaic and Classical periods\nand, as such, are a historian\u2019s best source of pan-Hellenic values. A major theme throughout\nboth epics is personal honor, which Homeric heroes value more than the collective cause. For\nexample, when Agamemnon slights Achilles\u2019 honor in the beginning of the Iliad, Achilles, the\nbest hero of the Greeks, withdraws from battle for much of the epic, even though his action\ncauses the Greeks to start losing battles until he rejoins the fight. A related theme is competitive\nexcellence, with kleos (eternal glory) as its goal: all Greek heroes want to be the best; thus,\neven while fighting in the same army, they see each other as competition. Ultimately, Achilles\nhas to make a choice: he can live a long life and die unknown, or he can die in battle young and\nhave everlasting glory. Achilles\u2019 selection of the second option made him the inspiration for such\nhistorical Greek warriors and generals as Alexander the Great, who brought his scroll copy of the\nIliad with him on all campaigns. Finally, the presence of the gods in the background of the Trojan\nWar shows the Greeks\u2019 belief that the gods were everywhere, and acted in the lives of mortals.\nThese gods could be powerful benefactors and patrons of individuals who respected them and\nsought their favor, or vicious enemies, bent on destruction. Indeed, early in the Iliad, the god\nApollo sends a plague on the Greek army at Troy, as punishment for disrespecting his priest.\nIt is important to note that while the Homeric epics influenced Greek values from the Archaic\nperiod on, they do not reflect the reality of the Greek world in any one period. Furthermore, they\nwere not composed by a single poet, Homer; indeed, it is possible that Homer never existed.\nBecause the epics were composed orally by multiple bards over the period of several hundred\nyears, they combine details about technological and other aspects of the Bronze Age with those\nof the Dark Ages and even the early Archaic Age. For instance, the heroes use bronze weapons\nside-by-side with iron. Archaeological evidence, however, allows historians to reconstruct to some\nextent a picture of the Greek world in the Bronze Age and the Dark Ages.\n5.8.2 Greece in the Bronze Age, and the Dark Ages\nWhile there were people living in mainland Greece already in the Neolithic Period, historians\ntypically begin the study of the Greeks as a unique civilization in the Bronze Age, with the\nMinoans. The first literate civilization in Europe, the Minoans were a palace civilization that\nflourished on the island of Crete c. 2,000 \u2013 1,450 BCE.\nAs befits island-dwellers, they were traders and seafarers; indeed, the Greek historian\nThucydides credits them with being the first Greeks to sail on ships. Sir Arthur Evans, the\narchaeologist who first excavated Crete in the early 1900s, dubbed them Minoans, after the\nmythical Cretan king Minos who was best known for building a labyrinth to house the Minotaur, a\nmonster that was half-man, half-bull. Bulls appear everywhere in surviving Minoan art, suggesting\nthat they indeed held a prominent place in Minoan mythology and religion.\nFour major palace sites survive on Crete. The most significant of them, Knossos, has been\nrestored and reconstructed for the benefit of modern tourists.\nPage | 183 Map 5.4 | Map of Minoan Crete\nAuthor: User \u201cBibi Saint-Poi\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nHistorians hypothesize that the palaces were the homes of local rulers, who ruled and protected\nthe surrounding farmland. The palaces seem to have kept records in two different writing systems,\nthe earliest known in Europe: the\nCretan hieroglyphic and Linear A\nscripts. Unfortunately, neither of\nthese systems has been deciphered,\nbut it is likely that these were palace\ninventories and records pertaining\nto trade. The palaces had no\nsurrounding walls, suggesting that\nthe Cretans maintained peace with\neach other and felt safe from outside\nattacks, since they lived on an island.\nThis sense of security proved to be a\nmistake as, around 1,450 BCE, the Figure 5.6 | The Bull-Leaping Fresco from Knossos\nAuthor: User \u201cJebulon\u201d\npalaces were violently destroyed by\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\ninvaders, possibly the Mycenaeans License: CC0 1.0\nPage | 184 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nwho arrived from mainland Greece. Recent\ndiscoveries also suggest that at least some of\nthe destruction may have been the result of\ntsunamis which accompanied the Santorini/\nThera volcanic eruption in the 1600s BCE.\nThe Mycenaeans, similarly to the Minoans,\nwere a palace civilization. Flourishing on\nmainland Greece c. 1,600 \u2013 1,100 BCE, they\nreceived their name from Mycenae, the most\nelaborate surviving palace and the mythical\nhome of Agamemnon, the commander-in-\nchief of the Greek army in the Trojan War.\nThe archaeological excavations of graves in Figure 5.7 | Reconstructed North Portico at Knossos\nAuthor: User \u201cBernard Gagnon\u201d\nMycenae reveal a prosperous civilization that\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nproduced elaborate pottery, bronze weapons License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nand tools, and extravagant jewelry and other\nobjects made of precious metals and gems. One of the most famous finds is the so-called \u201cMask\nof Agamemnon,\u201d a burial mask with which one aristocrat was buried, made of hammered gold.\nThe Mycenaeans also kept palace records in a syllabic script, known as Linear B. Related to the\nCretan Linear A script, Linear B, however, has been deciphered, and identified as Greek.\nArchaeological evidence also shows that sometime in the 1,200s BCE, the Mycenaean palaces\nsuffered a series of attacks and were gradually\nabandoned over the next century. The period\nthat begins around 1,000 BCE is known as the\n\u201cDark Ages\u201d because of the notable decline,\nin contrast with the preceding period. The\nMycenaean Linear B script disappears, and\narchaeological evidence shows a poorer\nGreece with a decline in material wealth\nand life expectancy. Some contact, however,\nmust have remained with the rest of the\nMediterranean, as shown by the emergence\nof the Greek alphabet, adapted from the\nPhoenician writing system towards the end of\nthe Dark Ages or early in the Archaic Period.\n5.9 ARCHAIC GREECE\nFigure 5.8 | Mask of Agamemnon, Mycenae The story of the Greek world in the Dark\nAuthor: User \u201cXuan Che\u201d Ages could mostly be described as a story\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nof fragmentation.

The Archaic period, however, appears to have\nbeen a time of growing contacts and connections between different parts of mainland Greece.\nFurthermore, it was a time of expansion, as the establishment of overseas colonies and cities\nbrought the Greeks to Italy and Sicily in the West, and Asia Minor and the Black Sea littoral in the\nEast. Furthermore, while Greeks in the Archaic period saw themselves as citizens of individual\ncity-states, this period also witnessed the rise of a Pan-Hellenic identity, as all Greeks saw\nthemselves connected by virtue of their common language, religion, and Homeric values. This\nPan-Hellenic identity was ultimately cemented during the Persian Wars: two invasions of Greece\nby the Persian Empire at the end of the Archaic period.\n5.9.1 Rise of the Hoplite Phalanx and the Polis\nA Corinthian vase, known today as the Chigi Vase, made in the mid-seventh century BCE,\npresents a tantalizing glimpse of the changing times from the Dark Ages to the Archaic Period.\nTaking up much of the decorated space on the vase is a battle scene. Two armies of warriors with\nround shields, helmets, and spears are facing each other and appear to be marching in formation\ntowards each other in preparation for attack.\nModern scholars largely consider the vase to be the earliest artistic portrayal of the hoplite\nphalanx, a new way of fighting that spread around the Greek world in the early Archaic Age and\nthat coincided with the rise of another key institution for subsequent Greek history: the polis,\nor city-state. From the early Archaic period to the conquest of the Greek world by Philip and\nAlexander in the late fourth century BCE, the polis was the central unit of organization in the\nGreek world.\nWhile warfare in the Iliad\nconsisted largely of duels between\nindividual heroes, the hoplite\nphalanx was a new mode of fighting\nthat did not rely on the skill of\nindividuals. Rather, it required all\nsoldiers in the line to work together\nas a whole. Armed in the same way\n\u2013 with a helmet, spear, and the\nround shield, the hoplon, which\ngave the hoplites their name \u2013 the\nsoldiers were arranged in rows,\npossibly as much as seven deep.\nEach soldier carried his shield on\nhis left arm, protecting the left side\nof his own body and the right side Figure 5.10 | \u201cUnrolled\u201d reconstructed image from the Chigi Vase\nof his comrade to the left. Working Author: User \u201cPhokion\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\ntogether as one, then, the phalanx\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nPage | 187 would execute the othismos (a mass shove) during battle, with the goal of shoving the enemy\nphalanx off the battlefield.\nHistorians do not know which came into existence first, the phalanx or the polis, but the two\nclearly reflect a similar ideology. In fact, the phalanx could be seen as a microcosm of the polis,\nexemplifying the chief values of the polis on a small scale. Each polis was a fully self-sufficient\nunit of organization, with its own laws, definition of citizenship, government, army, economy,\nand local cults. Regardless of the differences between the many poleis in matters of citizenship,\ngovernment, and law, one key similarity is clear: the survival of the polis depended on the\ndedication of all its citizens to the collective well-being of the city-state. This dedication included\nservice in the phalanx. As a result, citizenship in most Greek city-states was closely connected to\nmilitary service, and women were excluded from citizenship. Furthermore, since hoplites had\nto provide their own armor, these citizen-militias effectively consisted of landowners. This is\nnot to say, though, that the poorer citizens were entirely excluded from serving their city. One\nexample of a way in which they may have participated even in the phalanx appears on the Chigi\nVase. Marching between two lines of warriors is an unarmed man, playing a double-reed flute\n(seen on the right end of the top band in Figure 5.10). Since the success of the phalanx depended\non marching together in step, the flute-player\u2019s music would have been essential to ensure that\neveryone kept the same tempo during the march.\n5.9.2 Greek Religion\nOne theory modern scholars have proposed for the rise of the polis connects the locations of\nthe city-states to known cult-sites. The theory argues that the Greeks of the Archaic period built\ncity-states around these precincts of various gods in order to live closer to them and protect them.\nWhile impossible to know for sure if this theory or any other regarding the rise of the polis is true,\nthe building of temples in cities during the Archaic period shows the increasing emphasis that the\npoleis were placing on religion.\nIt is important to note that Greek religion seems to have been, at least to some extent, an\nelement of continuity from the Bronze Age to the Archaic period and beyond. The important\nrole that the gods play in the Homeric epics attests to their prominence in the oral tradition,\ngoing back to the Dark Ages. Furthermore, names of the following major gods worshipped in the\nArchaic period and beyond were found on the deciphered Linear B tablets: Zeus, king of the gods\nand god of weather, associated with the thunderbolt; Hera, Zeus\u2019 wife and patroness of childbirth;\nPoseidon, god of the sea; Hermes, messenger god and patron of thieves and merchants; Athena,\ngoddess of war and wisdom and patroness of women\u2019s crafts; Ares, god of war; Dionysus, god of\nwine; and the twins Apollo, god of the sun and both god of the plague and a healer, and Artemis,\ngoddess of the hunt and the moon. All of these gods continued to be the major divinities in Greek\nreligion for its duration, and many of them were worshipped as patron gods of individual cities,\nsuch as Artemis at Sparta, and Athena at Athens.\nWhile many local cults of even major gods were truly local in appeal, a few local cults achieved\ntruly Pan-Hellenic appeal. Drawing visitors from all over the Greek world, these Pan-Hellenic\nPage | 188 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\ncults were seen as belonging equally to all the\nGreeks. One of the most famous examples is the\ncult of Asclepius at Epidaurus. Asclepius, son\nof Apollo, was a healer god, and his shrine at\nEpidaurus attracted the pilgrims from all over\nthe Greek world. Visitors suffering from illness\npracticed incubation, that is, spending the night\nin the temple, in the hopes of receiving a vision\nin their dreams suggesting a cure. In gratitude for\nthe god\u2019s healing, some pilgrims dedicated casts\nof their healed body parts. Archaeological findings\ninclude a plentitude of ears, noses, arms, and feet.\nStarting out as local cults, several religious\nfestivals that included athletic competitions as\npart of the celebration also achieved Pan-Hellenic\nFigure 5.11 | Themis and Aegeus | The Pythia\nprominence during the Archaic period. The most\nseated on the tripod and holding a laurel branch\n\u2013 symbols of Apollo, who was the source of her influential of these were the Olympic Games.\nprophecies. This is the only surviving image of the Beginning in 776 BCE, the Olympic Games were\nPythia from ancient Greece\nheld in Olympia every four years in honor of Zeus;\nAuthor: User \u201cBibi Saint-Poi\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons they drew competitors from all over the Greek\nLicense: Public Domain world, and even Persia. The Pan-Hellenic appeal\nof the Olympics is signified by the impact that\nthese games had on Greek politics: for instance, a truce was in effect throughout the Greek world for\nthe duration of each Olympics. In addition, the Olympics provided a Pan-Hellenic system of dating\nevents by Olympiads or four-year cycles.\nFinally, perhaps the most politically influential of the Pan-Hellenic cults was the oracle of\nApollo at Delphi, established sometime in the eighth century BCE. Available for consultation\nonly nine days a year, the oracle spoke responses to the questions asked by inquirers through\na priestess, named the Pythia. The Pythia\u2019s responses came in the form of poetry and were\nnotoriously difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, city-states and major rulers throughout the Greek\nworld considered it essential to consult the oracle before embarking on any major endeavor, such\nas war or founding a colony.\n5.9.3 Maritime Trade and Colonization\nThe historian Herodotus records that sometime c. 630 BCE, the king of the small island of Thera\ntraveled to Delphi to offer a sacrifice and consult the oracle on a few minor points. To his surprise,\nthe oracle\u2019s response had nothing to do with his queries. Instead, the Pythia directed him to found a\ncolony in Libya, in North Africa. Having never heard of Libya, the king ignored the advice. A seven-\nyear drought ensued, and the Therans felt compelled to consult the oracle again. Receiving the same\nresponse as before, they finally sent out a group of colonists who eventually founded the city of Cyrene.\nPage | 189 While this story may sound absurd, it is similar to other\nfoundation stories of Greek colonies and emphasizes the importance\nof the Delphic oracle. At the same time, though, this story still\nleaves open the question of motive: why did so many Greek city-\nstates of the Archaic period send out colonies to other parts of the\nGreek world? Archaeology and foundation legends, such as those\nrecorded by Herodotus, suggest two chief reasons: population\npressures along with shortage of productive farmland in the cities\non mainland Greece, and increased ease of trade that colonies\nabroad facilitated. In addition to resolving these two problems,\nhowever, the colonies also had the unforeseen impact of increasing\ninteractions of the Greeks with the larger Mediterranean world and\nthe ancient Near East. These interactions are visible, for instance,\nin the so-called Orientalizing style of art in the Archaic period, a\nstyle the Greeks borrowed from the Middle East and Egypt.\nAs section 5.3.5 will show, however, the presence of Greek\ncolonies in Asia Minor also played a major role in bringing about\nthe Greco-Persian Wars.\n5.9.4. Aristocracy, Democracy, and Tyranny in\nArchaic Greece\nFigure 5.12 | Archaic kouros\nLater Greek historians, including Herodotus and Thucydides, (youth) statue, c. 530 BC |\nnoted a certain trend in the trajectory of the history of most Greek Note the Egyptian hairstyle and\nbody pose.\npoleis: most city-states started out with a monarchical or quasi-\nAuthor: User \u201cMountain\u201d\nmonarchical government. Over time the people gained greater Source: Wikimedia Commons\nrepresentation, and an assembly of all citizens had at least some License: Public Domain\ndegree of political power\u2014although some degree of strife typically\nmaterialized between the aristocrats and the poorer elements. Taking advantage of such civic\nconflicts, tyrants came to power in most city-states for a brief period before the people banded\ntogether and drove them out, thenceforth replacing them with a more popular form of government.\nMany modern historians are skeptical about some of the stories that the Greek historians tell\nabout origins of some poleis; for instance, it is questionable whether the earliest Thebans truly were\nborn from dragon teeth. Similarly, the stories about some of the Archaic tyrants seem to belong\nmore to the realm of legend than history. Nevertheless, the preservation of stories about tyrants in\nearly oral tradition suggests that city-states likely went through periods of turmoil and change in\ntheir form of government before developing a more stable constitution. Furthermore, this line of\ndevelopment accurately describes the early history of Athens, the best-documented polis.\nIn the early Archaic period, Athens largely had an aristocratic constitution. Widespread debt-\nslavery, however, caused significant civic strife in the city and led to the appointment of Solon as\nlawgiver for the year 594/3 BCE, specifically for the purpose of reforming the laws. Solon created a\nPage | 190 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nmore democratic constitution and also left poetry documenting justifications for his reforms\u2014and\ndifferent citizens\u2019 reactions to them. Most controversial of all, Solon instituted a one-time debt-\nforgiveness, seisachtheia, which literally means \u201cshaking off.\u201d He proceeded to divide all citizens\ninto five classes based on income, assigning a level of political participation and responsibility\ncommensurate with each class. Shortly after Solon\u2019s reforms, a tyrant, Peisistratus, illegally\nseized control of Athens and remained in power off and on from 561 to 527 BCE. Peisistratus\nseems to have been a reasonably popular ruler who had the support of a significant portion of the\nAthenian population. His two sons, Hippias and Hipparchus, however, appear to have been less\nwell-liked. Two men, Harmodius and Aristogeiton, assassinated Hipparchus in 514 BCE; then\nin 508 BCE, the Athenians, with the help of a Spartan army, permanently drove out Hippias.\nIn subsequent Athenian history, Harmodius and Aristogeiton were considered heroes of the\ndemocracy and celebrated as tyrannicides.\nFigure 5.13 | The structure of the Classical Athenian democracy, fourth century BCE\nAuthor: User \u201cMathieugp\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 191 Immediately following the expulsion of Hippias, Athens underwent a second round of\ndemocratic reforms, led by Cleisthenes. The Cleisthenic constitution remained in effect, with\nfew changes, until the Macedonian conquest of Athens in the fourth century BCE and is considered\nto be the Classical Athenian democracy. Central to the democracy was the participation of all\ncitizens in two types of institutions: the ekklesia, an assembly of all citizens, which functioned as\nthe chief deliberative body of the city; and the law-courts, to which citizens were assigned by lot\nas jurors. Two chief offices, the generals and the archos, ruled over the city and were appointed\nfor one-year terms. Ten generals were elected annually by the ekklesia for the purpose of leading\nthe Athenian military forces. Finally, the leading political office each year, the nine archons, were\nappointed by lot from all eligible citizens. While this notion of appointing the top political leaders\nby lot may seem surprising, it exemplifies the Athenians\u2019 pride in their democracy and their desire\nto believe that, in theory at least, all Athenian citizens were equally valuable and capable of leading\ntheir city-state.\nDeveloping in a very different manner from Athens, Sparta was seen by other Greek poleis\nas a very different sort of city from the rest. Ruled from an early period by two kings \u2013 one from\neach of the two royal houses that ruled jointly \u2013 Sparta was a true oligarchy, in which the power\nFigure 5.14 | Structure of the Spartan Constitution\nAuthor: User \u201cPutinovac\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY 3.0\nPage | 192 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nrested in its gerousia, a council\nof thirty elders, whose number\nincluded the two kings. While an\nassembly of all citizens existed\nas well, its powers were much\nmore limited than were those\nof the Athenian assembly. Yet\nbecause of much more restrictive\ncitizenship rules, Spartan\nassembly of citizens would have\nfelt as a more selective body, as\nFigure 5.14 illustrates.\nA crucial moment in Spartan\nhistory was the city\u2019s conquest of\nthe nearby region of Messenia in\nthe eighth century BCE.\nThe Spartans annexed the\nMessenian territory to their\nown and made the Messenians\nMap 5.5 | Map of Sparta and the Environs\nhelots. While the helots could Author: User \u201cMarsyas\u201d\nnot be bought or sold, they were Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\npermanently tied to the land\nin a status akin to medieval\nEuropean serfs. The availability of helot labor allowed the Spartans from that point on to focus\ntheir attention on military training. This focus transformed Sparta into the ultimate military state\nin the Greek world, widely respected by the other Greek poleis for its military prowess. Other\nGreeks were fascinated by such Spartan practices as the communal bringing up of all children\napart from their parents and the requirement that all Spartan girls and women, as well as boys\nand men, maintain a strict regimen of exercise and training.\nBut while Athens and Sparta sound like each other\u2019s diametrical opposites, the practices\nof both poleis ultimately derived from the same belief that all city-states held: that, in order to\nensure their city\u2019s survival, the citizens must place their city-state\u2019s interests above their own. A\ndemocracy simply approached this goal with a different view of the qualifications of its citizens\nthan did an oligarchy.\nA final note on gender is necessary, in connection with Greek city-states\u2019 definitions of\ncitizenship. Only children of legally married and freeborn citizen parents could be citizens in most\ncity-states. Women had an ambiguous status in the Greek poleis. While not full-fledged citizens\nthemselves, they produced citizens. This view of the primary importance of wives in the city as\nthe mothers of citizens resulted in diametrically opposite laws in Athens and Sparta, showing\nthe different values that the respective cities emphasized. In Athens, if a husband caught his wife\nwith an adulterer in his home, the law allowed the husband to kill said adulterer on the spot. The\nPage | 193 adultery law was so harsh precisely because adultery put into question the citizenship status of\npotential children, thereby depriving the city of future citizens. By contrast, Spartan law allowed\nan unmarried man who wanted offspring to sleep with the wife of another man, with the latter\u2019s\nconsent, specifically for the purpose of producing children. This law reflects the importance that\nSparta placed on producing strong future soldiers as well as the communal attitude of the city\ntowards family and citizenship.\n5.9.5 The Persian Wars\nDespite casting their net far and wide in founding colonies, the Greeks seem to have remained\nin a state of relatively peaceful coexistence with the rest of their Mediterranean neighbors until the\nsixth century BCE. In the mid-sixth century BCE, Cyrus, an ambitious king of Persia, embarked\non a swift program of expansion, ultimately consolidating under his rule the largest empire of the\nancient world and earning for himself the title \u201cCyrus the Great.\u201d\nCyrus\u2019 Achaemenid Empire bordered the area of Asia Minor that had been previously\ncolonized by the Greeks. This expansion of the Persian Empire brought the Persians into direct\nconflict with the Greeks and became the origin of the Greco-Persian Wars, the greatest military\nconflict the Greek world had known up until that point.\nOver the second half of the sixth century, the Persians had taken over the region of Asia Minor,\nalso known as Ionia, installing as rulers of these Greek city-states tyrants loyal to Persia. In 499\nBCE, however, the Greek city-states in Asia Minor joined forces to rebel against the Persian rule.\nAthens and Eretria sent military support for this Ionian Revolt, and the rebelling forces marched\non the Persian capital of Sardis and burned it in 498 BCE, before the revolt was finally subdued\nby the Persians in 493 BCE.\nSeeking revenge on Athens and Eretria, the Persian king Darius launched an expedition in\n490 BCE.\nDarius\u2019 forces captured Eretria in\nmid-summer, destroyed the city, and\nenslaved its inhabitants. Sailing a short\ndistance across the bay, the Persian\narmy then landed at Marathon. The\nworried Athenians sent a plea for help\nto Sparta. The Spartans, in the middle\nof a religious festival, refused to help.\nSo, on September 12, 490 BCE, the\nAthenians, with only a small force of\nPlataeans helping, faced the much\nlarger Persian army in the Battle of\nMarathon. The decisive Athenian\nMap 5.6 | The Achaemenid Empire under the rule of Cyrus\nAuthor: User \u201cGabagool\u201d victory showed the superiority of the\nSource: Wikimedia Commons Greek hoplite phalanx and marked the\nLicense: CC BY 3.0\nPage | 194 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nMap 5.7 | Map of the Greek World during the Persian Wars (500-479 BCE)\nAuthor: User \u201cBibib Saint-poi\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nend of the first Persian invasion of Greece. Furthermore, the victory at Marathon, which remained\na point of pride for the Athenians for centuries after, demonstrated to the rest of the Greeks that\nSparta was not the only great military power in Greece.\nDarius died in 486 BCE, having never realized his dream of revenge against the Greeks. His\nson, Xerxes, however, continued his father\u2019s plans and launched in 480 BCE a second invasion\nof Greece, with an army so large that, as the historian Herodotus claims, it drank entire rivers dry\non its march. The Greek world reacted in a much more organized fashion to this second invasion\nthan it did to the first. Led by Athens and Sparta, some seventy Greek poleis formed a sworn\nalliance to fight together against the Persians. This alliance, the first of its kind, proved to be the\nkey to defeating the Persians as it allowed the allies to split forces strategically in order to guard\nagainst Persian attack by both land and sea. The few Greek city-states who declared loyalty to the\nPage | 195 Persian Empire instead\u2013most notably, Thebes\u2013were seen as traitors for centuries to come by the\nrest of the Greeks.\nMarching through mainland Greece from the north, the Persians first confronted the Spartans\nat the Battle of Thermopylae, a narrow mountain pass that stood in the way of the Persians\u2019\naccessing any point south. In this now-legendary battle, 300 Spartans, led by their king Leonidas,\nsuccessfully defended the pass for two days before being betrayed by a local who showed a\nroundabout route to the Persians. The Persians then were able to outflank the Spartans and kill\nthem to the last man. This battle, although a loss for the Greeks, bought crucial time for the rest\nof the Greek forces in preparing to face the Persians. It is also important to note that although the\nSpartans were considered even in the ancient world to be the heroes of Thermopylae, they were\nalso accompanied by small contingents from several other Greek city-states in this endeavor.\nThe victory at Thermopylae fulfilled the old dream of Darius, as it allowed access to Athens\nfor the Persians. The Athenian statesman Themistocles, however, had ordered a full evacuation\nof the city in advance of the Persian attack through an unusual interpretation of a Delphic oracle\nstating that wooden walls will save Athens. Taking the oracle to mean that the wooden walls in\nquestion were ships, Themistocles built a massive fleet which he used to send all of the city\u2019s\ninhabitants to safety. His gamble proved to be successful, and the Persians captured and burned\na mostly empty city.\nThe Athenians proceeded to defeat the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis, off the coast of\nAthens, thus shortly before winter turning the tide of the war in favor of the Greeks. Finally, in June\nof 479 BCE, the Greek forces were able to strike the two final blows, defeating the Persian land and\nsea forces on the same day in the Battle of Plataea on land and the Battle of Mycale on sea. The\nvictory at Mycale also resulted in a second Ionian revolt, which this time ended in a victory for the\nGreek city-states in Asia Minor. Xerxes was left to sail home to his diminished empire.\nIt is difficult to overestimate the impact of the Persian Wars on subsequent Greek history. Seen\nby historians as the end-point of the Archaic Period, the Persian Wars cemented Pan-Hellenic\nidentity, as they saw cooperation on an unprecedented scale among the Greek city-states. In\naddition, the Persian Wars showed the Greek military superiority over the Persians on both land\nand sea. Finally, the wars showed Athens in a new light to the rest of the Greeks. As the winners of\nMarathon in the first invasion and the leaders of the navy during the second invasion, the Athenians\nemerged from the wars as the rivals of Sparta for military prestige among the Greeks. This last\npoint, in particular, proved to be the most influential for Greek history in the subsequent period.\n5.10 THE CLASSICAL PERIOD\nSo far, the story of the Greek world in this chapter has proceeded from a narrative of the\nfragmented Greek world in the Dark Ages to the emergence and solidification of a Pan-Hellenic\nidentity in the Archaic Period. The story of the Greeks in the Classical Period, by contrast, is\nbest described as the strife for leadership of the Greek world. First, Athens and Sparta spent\nmuch of the fifth century BCE battling each other for control of the Greek world. Then, once both\nwere weakened, other states began attempting to fill the power vacuum. Ultimately, the Classical\nPage | 196 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nPeriod will end with the Greek world under the control of a power that was virtually unknown to\nthe Greeks at the beginning of the fifth century BCE: Macedon.\n5.10.1 From the Delian League to the Athenian Empire\nIn 478 BCE, barely a year after the end of the Persian Wars, a group of Greek city-states,\nmainly those located in Ionia and on the island between mainland Greece and Ionia, founded the\nDelian League, with the aim of continuing to protect the Greeks in Ionia from Persian attacks.\nLed by Athens, the league first met on the tiny island of Delos. According to Greek mythology, the\ntwin gods Apollo and Artemis were born on Delos. As a result, the island was considered sacred\nground and, as such, was a fitting neutral headquarters for the new alliance. The league allowed\nmember states the option of either contributing a tax (an option that most members selected)\nMap 5.8 | Map of The Athenian Empire in 431 BCE\nAuthor: User \u201cMarsyas\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 197 or contributing ships for the league\u2019s navy. The treasury of the league, where the taxes paid by\nmembers were deposited, was housed on Delos.\nOver the next twenty years, the Delian League gradually transformed from a loose alliance of\nstates led by Athens to a more formal entity. The League\u2019s Athenian leadership, in the meanwhile,\ngrew to be that of an imperial leader. The few members who tried to secede from the League, such\nas the island of Naxos, quickly learned that doing so was not an option as the revolt was violently\nsubdued. Finally, in 454 BCE, the treasury of the Delian League moved to Athens. That moment\nmarked the transformation of the Delian League into the Athenian Empire.\nSince the Athenians publicly inscribed each year the one-sixtieth portion of the tribute that\nthey dedicated to Athena, records survive listing the contributing members for a number of years,\nthereby allowing historians to see the magnitude of the Athenian operation.\nWhile only the Athenian side of the story survives, it appears that the Athenians\u2019 allies in the\nDelian League were not happy with the transformation of the alliance into a full-fledged Athenian\nEmpire. Non-allies were affected a well. The fifth-century BCE Athenian historian Thucydides\ndramatizes in his history one particularly harsh treatment of a small island, Melos, which effectively\nrefused to join the Athenian cause. To add insult to injury, once the treasury of the Empire had been\nmoved to Athens, the Athenians had used some funds from it for their own building projects, the\nmost famous of these projects being the Parthenon, the great temple to Athena on the Acropolis.\nThe bold decision to move the treasury of the Delian League to Athens was the brainchild\nof the leading Athenian statesman of the fifth century BCE, Pericles. A member of a prominent\naristocratic family, Pericles was a predominant politician for forty years, from the early 460s BCE\nto his death in 429 BCE, and was instrumental in the development of a more popular democracy\nin Athens. Under his leadership, an especially vibrant feeling of Athenian patriotic pride seems\nto have developed, and the decision to move the Delian League treasury to Athens fits into this\npattern as well. Shortly after moving\nthe treasury to Athens, Pericles\nsponsored a Citizenship Decree in\n451 BCE that restricted Athenian\ncitizenship from thence onwards\nonly to individuals who had two free-\nborn and legitimately-wed Athenian\nparents, both of whom were also born\nof Athenian parents. Then c. 449 BCE,\nPericles successfully proposed a decree\nallowing the Athenians to use Delian\nLeague funds for Athenian building\nprojects, and, c. 447 BCE, he sponsored\nthe Athenian Coinage Decree, a decree Figure 5.15 | Model of the Acropolis, with the Parthenon\nthat imposed Athenian standards of in the middle\nAuthor: User \u201cBenson Kua\u201d\nweights and measures on all states that\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nwere members of the Delian League. License: CC BY-SA 2.0\nPage | 198 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nLater in his life, Pericles famously described Athens as \u201cthe school of Hellas;\u201d this description\nwould certainly have fit Athens just as much in the mid-fifth century BCE as, in addition to the\nflourishing of art and architecture, the city was a center of philosophy and drama.\nThe growing wealth and power of Athens in the twenty or so years since the Persian Wars\ndid not escape Sparta and led to increasingly tense relations between the two leading powers in\nGreece. Sparta had steadily consolidated the Peloponnesian League in this same time-period, but\nSparta\u2019s authority over this league was not quite as strict as was the Athenian control over the\nDelian League. Finally, in the period of 460-445 BCE, the Spartans and the Athenians engaged\nin a series of battles, to which modern scholars refer as the First Peloponnesian War. In 445\nBCE, the two sides swore to a Thirty Years Peace, a treaty that allowed both sides to return to their\npre-war holdings, with few exceptions. Still, Spartan unease in this period of Athenian expansion\nand prosperity, which resulted in the First Peloponnesian War, was merely a sign of much more\nserious conflict to come. As the Athenian general and historian Thucydides later wrote about the\nreasons for the Great Peloponnesian War, which erupted in 431 BCE: \u201cBut the real cause of the\nwar was one that was formally kept out of sight. The growing power of Athens, and the fear that it\ninspired in Sparta, made the war inevitable\u201d (Thucydides, I.23).\n5.10.2 The Peloponnesian War (431 \u2013 404 BCE)\nHistorians today frown on the use of the term \u201cinevitable\u201d to describe historical events. Still,\nThucydides\u2019 point about the inevitability of the Peloponnesian War is perhaps appropriate,\nas following a conflict that had been bubbling under the surface for fifty years, the war finally\nbroke out over a seemingly minor affair. In 433 BCE, Corcyra, a colony of Corinth that no longer\nwanted to be under the control of its mother-city, asked Athens for protection against Corinth.\nThe Corinthians claimed that the Athenian support of Corcyra was a violation of the Thirty Years\nPeace. At a subsequent meeting of the Peloponnesian League in Sparta in 432 BCE, the allies,\nalong with Sparta, voted that the peace had been broken and so declared war against Athens.\nAt the time of the war\u2019s declaration, no one thought that it would last twenty-seven years and\nwould ultimately embroil the entire Greek-speaking world. Rather, the Spartans expected that\nthey would march with an army to Athens, fight a decisive battle, then return home forthwith.\nThe long duration of the war, however, was partly the result of the different strengths of the two\nleading powers. Athens was a naval empire, with allies scattered all over the Ionian Sea. Sparta,\non the other hand, was a land-locked power with supporters chiefly in the Peloponnese and with\nno navy to speak of at the outset of the war.\nThe Peloponnesian War brought about significant changes in the government of both Athens\nand Sparta, so that, by the end of the war, neither power looked as it did at its outset. Athens, in\nparticular, became more democratic because of increased need for manpower to row its fleet.\nThe lowest census bracket, the thetes, whose poverty and inability to buy their own armor had\npreviously excluded them from military service, became by the end of the war a full-fledged\npart of the Athenian forces and required a correspondingly greater degree of political influence.\nIn the case of Sparta, the war had ended the Spartan policy of relative isolationism from the\nPage | 199 rest of the affairs of the Greek city-states. The\nlength of the war also brought about significant\nchanges to the nature of Greek warfare. While\nwar was previously largely a seasonal affair,\nwith many conflicts being decided with a single\nbattle, the Peloponnesian War forced the Greek\ncity-states to support standing armies. Finally,\nwhile sieges of cities and attacks on civilians\nwere previously frowned upon, they became the\nnorm by the end of the Peloponnesian War. In\nshort, Thucydides\u2019s narrative of the war shows\nthat the war had a detrimental effect on human\nnature, encouraging a previously unprecedented\ndegree of cruelty on both sides. It is important\nto note, though, that as brutal as sieges could\nbe during the Peloponnesian War, Greek siege\nwarfare during the fifth century BCE was still\nquite primitive, as no tools existed for ramming\nor otherwise damaging the city gates or walls.\nFurthermore, catapults, so useful for targeting\na city from the outside, first came into being in\n399 BCE, five years after the war had ended.\nModern historians divide the Peloponnesian\nMap 5.9 | Map of the Peloponnesian War Alliances War into three distinct stages, based on the\nat the Start and Contrasting Strategies, 431 BCE\ntactics used in each: the Archidamian War,\nAuthor: User \u201cMagnus Manske\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons the Peace of Nicias, and the Decelean War.\nLicense: Public Domain The first stage, the Archidamian War (431 \u2013\n421 BCE), is named after the Spartan king\nArchidamus, who proposed the strategy of annual invasions of Attica at the beginning of the\nwar. Beginning in late spring and early summer of 431 BCE, Archidamus led the Spartan army\nto invade Attica in order to devastate the agricultural land around the city. The Spartans thereby\nhoped to provoke the Athenians to a battle. Pericles however, refused to enter into battle against\nthe Spartans, and instead ordered all inhabitants of Attica to retreat within the city. Pericles\u2019\ndecision was wise, as the Athenians would likely have lost a land battle against the Spartans.\nHis decision, though, had unforeseen repercussions. In 430 BCE, the crowded conditions within\nAthens resulted in the outbreak of a virulent plague which by some estimates killed as much as\ntwenty-five percent of the city\u2019s population over the following three years. Among the dead was\nnone other than Pericles himself.\nThe plague had significant repercussions for Athens during the first phase of the war because\nof not only the loss of fighting men to disease and the consequent lowered morale in the city, but\nalso the death of Pericles, the moderate leader. The subsequent leaders who emerged, such as\nPage | 200 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nCleon, were known as war-hawks. Meanwhile, the Spartans continued their annual invasions of\nAttica until 425 BCE, when luck was finally on the Athenians\u2019 side.\nIn 425 BCE, the Athenian fleet faced a new Spartan fleet in the Battle of Pylos in the\nPeloponnese. The Athenians won the battle and also managed to trap 420 Spartans on the tiny\nisland of Sphacteria, just off the coast of Pylos. Sending shockwaves through the entire Greek\nworld, the Spartans surrendered. By bringing the hostages to Athens, the Athenians put an end to\nthe annual invasions of Attica. Finally, in 421 BCE, with the death of the most pro-war generals\non both sides, the Athenians with their allies signed a peace treaty with Spartans and their allies.\nNamed the \u201cPeace of Nicias\u201d after the Athenian general who brokered this treaty, it was supposed\nto be a fifty years\u2019 peace; it allowed both sides to return to their pre-war holdings, with a few\nexceptions. As part of the peace terms, the Spartan hostages from Pylos were finally released.\nDespite its ambitious casting as a fifty years\u2019 peace, the Peace of Nicias proved to be a short and\nuneasy time filled with minor battles and skirmishes. One problem with the treaty was that while\nAthens and all of its allies signed the peace, several key allies of Sparta, including Corinth and Thebes,\nrefused to do so. Furthermore, Athens made the disastrous decision during this stalemate to launch\nthe Sicilian Expedition, a venture that took much of the Athenian fleet to Sicily in 415 BCE.\nSyracuse, however, proved to be a difficult target, and the expedition ended in 413 BCE with a\ncomplete destruction of the Athenian navy. That same year, the Spartans renewed the fighting,\nlaunching the third and final phase of the Peloponnesian War.\nIn the third stage of the Peloponnesian war, also known as the Decelean War, the Spartans\ntook the war to Attic soil by occupying Decelea, a village in Attica proper, and transforming it into a\nMap 5.10 | Map of the Sicilian Expedition\nAuthor: User \u201cKenmyer\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC0\nPage | 201 military fort. This occupation allowed the Spartans to prevent the Athenians from farming their\nland and cutting off Athens from most supply routes, effectively crippling the Athenian economy\nfor the remainder of the war. Losing the Sicilian Expedition and the challenge of the Decelean\nWar produced a high level of resentment towards the democratic leaders in Athens. Therefore in\n411 BCE, an oligarchic coup briefly replaced the democracy with the rule of the Four Hundred.\nWhile this oligarchy was quickly overthrown and the democracy restored, this internal instability\nhighlighted the presence of the aristocratic element in the city as well as the dissatisfaction of at\nleast the aristocratic citizens with the long war.\nRemarkably, in a testament to the resilience and power of the Athenian state, the Athenians\nmanaged to rebuild a navy after the Sicilian Expedition, and even managed to continue to win\nbattles on sea during this final phase of the war. In 405 BCE, however, the Spartan general Lysander\ndefeated Athens in the naval battle of Aegospotami. He proceeded to besiege Athens, and the city\nfinally surrendered in 404 BCE. For the second time in a decade, the Athenian democracy was\noverthrown, to be replaced this time by the Spartan-sanctioned oligarchy known as the Tyranny\nof the Thirty. The rule of the Thirty proved to be a much more brutal oligarchy than that of the\nFour Hundred. A year later, an army formed largely of Athenian democrats in exile marched on\nthe city and overthrew the Thirty. The democracy thus was restored in 403 BCE, and the painful\nprocess of recovery from the war and the oligarchic rule could begin.\n5.10.3 Athenian Culture during the Peloponnesian War\nBecause it drained Athens of manpower and financial resources, the Peloponnesian War\nproved to be an utter practical disaster for Athens. Nevertheless, the war period was also the\npinnacle of Athenian culture, most notably its tragedy, comedy, and philosophy. Tragedy and\ncomedy in Athens were very much popular entertainment, intended to appeal to all citizens. Thus\nissues considered in these plays were often ones of paramount concern for the city at the time\nwhen the plays were written. As one character in a comedy bitterly joked in an address to the\naudience, more Athenians attended tragic and comic performances than came to vote at assembly\nmeetings. Not surprisingly, war was a common topic of discussion in the plays. Furthermore, war\nwas not portrayed positively, as the playwrights repeatedly emphasized the costs of war for both\nwinners and losers.\nSophocles, one of the two most prominent Athenian tragedians during the Peloponnesian\nWar era, had served his city as a general, albeit at an earlier period; thus, he had direct experience\nwith war. Many of his tragedies that were performed during the war dealt with the darker side\nof fighting, for both soldiers and generals, and the cities that are affected. By tradition, however,\ntragedies tackled contemporary issues through integrating them into mythical stories, and the\ntwo mythical wars that Sophocles portrayed in his tragedies were the Trojan War, as in Ajax and\nPhiloctetes, and the aftermath of the war of the Seven against Thebes, in which Polynices, the son\nof Oedipus, led six other heroes to attack Thebes, a city led by his brother Eteocles, as in Oedipus\nat Colonus. Sophocles\u2019 plays repeatedly showed the emotional and psychological challenges of war\nfor soldiers and civilians alike; they also emphasized the futility of war, as the heroes of his plays,\nPage | 202 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\njust as in the original myths on which they were based, died tragic, untimely deaths. Sophocles\u2019\nyounger contemporary, Euripides, had a similar interest in depicting the horrors of war and\nwrote a number of tragedies on the impact of war on the defeated, such as in Phoenician Women\nand Hecuba; both of these plays explored the aftermath of the Trojan War from the perspective\nof the defeated Trojans.\nWhile the tragic playwrights explored the impact of the war on both the fighters and the civilians\nthrough narrating mythical events, the comic playwright Aristophanes was far less subtle. The\nanti-war civilian who saves the day and ends the war was a common hero in the Aristophanic\ncomedies. For instance, in the Acharnians (425 BCE), the main character is a war-weary farmer\nwho, frustrated with the inefficiency of the Athenian leadership in ending the war, brokers his\nown personal peace with Sparta. Similarly, in Peace (421 BCE), another anti-war farmer fattens\nup a dung beetle in order to fly to Olympus and beg Zeus to free Peace. Finally, in Lysistrata (411\nBCE), the wives of all Greek city-states, missing their husbands who are at war, band together in\na plot to end the war by going on a sex-strike until their husbands make peace. By the end of the\nplay, their wish comes true. Undeniably funny, the jokes in these comedies, nevertheless, have a\nbitter edge, akin to the portrayal of war in the tragedies. The overall impression from the war-era\ndrama is that the playwrights, as well as perhaps the Athenians themselves, spent much of the\nPeloponnesian War dreaming of peace.\nWhile the playwrights were dreaming of the things of this world\u2013most notably war\u2013their\ncontemporary, Socrates, was dreaming of difficult questions. One of the most prominent\nphilosophers of the ancient world, Socrates has not left any writings of his own, but thoughts\nattributed to him survive in dialogues penned by his student, the fourth-century philosopher\nPlato. In Plato\u2019s writings, Socrates comes across as someone who loved difficult questions and\nwho was not above confronting any passers-by with such questions as \u201cWhat is courage?\u201d; \u201cWhat\nis moral?\u201d; \u201cWhat would the ideal city look like?\u201d Using what became known ever since as the\n\u201cSocratic method,\u201d Socrates continued to probe further every definition and answer that his\nconversation partners provided, guiding them to delve deeper in their reflections on the topics at\nhand than they had before. As a result of his love of such debates, Socrates was seen as connected\nto the Sophists, philosophical debate teachers, who (as Aristophanes joked) could teach anyone\nto convince others of anything at all, regardless of reality or truth. But Socrates radically differed\nfrom the Sophists by not charging fees for his teaching. Instead, as he himself is purported to\nhave said, he was a pest-like gadfly that kept disturbing Athens from growing too content and\nencouraged all with whom he spoke to keep thinking and questioning.\n5.10.4 The Fourth Century BCE\nIn 399 BCE, a seventy-year old Athenian was put on trial for impiety and for corrupting the\nyouth, convicted, and speedily sentenced to death. The trial is especially shocking, since the man\nin question was none other than Socrates, the philosopher who had spent his life wandering the\nstreets of Athens engaging in endless dialogues regarding the meaning of life. Why did the Athenians\nsuddenly turn against this public teacher and judge him worthy of execution? The answer, most\nPage | 203 Map 5.11 | Map of The Theban Hegemony\nAuthor: User \u201cMegistais\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nlikely, is not the openly-stated causes of the trial, but rather the connections that Socrates previously\nhad to oligarchic leaders. In particular, Socrates had taught Critias, who became one of the Thirty\nin 404 BCE. Fueled by their hatred of all enemies of the democracy and anyone who had associated\nwith the Thirty, the Athenians condemned Socrates to death. This trial shows how deeply the scars\nwent in the collective psyche and how difficult it was for the Athenians to forget the terrible end of\nthe Peloponnesian War. And while, as usual, more information survives about how the Athenians\u2014\nmore than any other polis\u2014dealt with the aftermath of the war, it is clear that for the rest of the\nPage | 204 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nGreek world, their life in the fourth\ncentury BCE was very much the\nresult of the Peloponnesian War.\nThe early fourth century saw a\npower vacuum emerge in the Greek\nworld for the first time since the\nearly Archaic Period. Defeated in\nthe war, Athens was no longer an\nEmpire, while the winner, Sparta,\nFigure 5.16 | The Macedonian Phalanx | The wedge formation\nhad suffered a catastrophic decline\nusing the Macedonian sarissa, a spear about eighteen feet in length\nin its population over the course Author: User \u201cAlagos\u201d\nof the Peloponnesian War. At the Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nsame time, Thebes had revamped\nits military, introducing the first two\nsignificant changes to the hoplite phalanx way of fighting since its inception: slightly longer spears,\nand wedge formation. The final key to the Theban military supremacy was the Theban Sacred\nBand, formed in 378 BCE. An elite core of 300 warriors, the band consisted of 150 couples, based on\nthe assumption that the lovers would fight most bravely in order not to appear to be cowardly to their\nbeloved. In 371 BCE, the Thebans demonstrated the success of their military reforms by defeating\nthe Spartans at the Battle\nof Leuctra. They continued\nan aggressive program of\nmilitary expansion over the\nnext decade, a period known\nas the Theban Hegemony.\nSometime in the 360\u2019s\nBCE, a young Macedonian\nprince stayed for several\nyears in Thebes as a hostage.\nWhile there, he caught the\neye of the military reformer,\nEpaminondas, who took\nthe prince under his wing.\nCirca 364 BCE, the prince\nreturned to Macedon, and,\nin 359 BCE, he ascended to\nthe throne as king Philip II.\nMap 5.12 | Map of the Conquests of Philip | The Kingdom of Macedon Up until that point in Greek\nat the death of Philip II (336 BC) history, the Macedonians\nAuthor: User \u201cMarsyas\u201d\nhad largely been known for\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 two things: drinking their\nPage | 205 wine undiluted, which had marked them as complete and utter barbarians in the eyes of the rest\nof the Greeks, and being excellent horsemen. With Philip at the helm, this estimation was about\nto change. As soon as he came to the throne, Philip began transforming the Macedonian military\ninto a more successful image of what he had seen at Thebes. Philip further lengthened the already\nlonger spears used by the Thebans, creating the Macedonian sarissa, a spear of about eighteen\nfeet in length, double that of the traditional Greek hoplite spear.\nHe retained the Theban wedge formation but also added heavy cavalry to the line, thus\nincorporating the Macedonians\u2019 strongest element into the phalanx. The results spoke for\nthemselves, as over the next twenty years, Philip systematically conquered all of mainland Greece,\nwith the exception of Sparta, which he chose to leave alone. Philip\u2019s final great victory, which he\nshared with his teenage son Alexander, was at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), in which the\nMacedonian armies defeated the combined forces of Athens and Thebes. Philip\u2019s conquest of the\nentire mainland was the end of an era, as for the first time, the entire territory was united under the\nrule of a king.\nBy all accounts, it appears that Philip was not going to stop at just conquering the Greek world.\nHe did not, however, have this choice.

Alexander\u2019s first target\nwas the Persian Empire, motivated in part by his love of Homer\u2019s Iliad, and the perception among\nthe Greeks that this new campaign was the continuation of the original, mythical war against Asia.\nMoving farther and farther East in his campaigns, Alexander conquered the Balkans, Egypt, and\nthe territories of modern-day Lebanon, Syria, and Israel before he achieved a decisive victory over\nDarius III at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE.\nContinuing to move eastwards, Alexander invaded India in 327 BCE, planning to conquer\nthe known world and assuming that he was close to this achievement, since the Greeks of his\nday were not aware of China\u2019s existence. His war-weary troops, however, rebelled in 326 BCE\nand demanded to return home (see Chapter 3). It appears that this mutiny was not the first that\noccurred in Alexander\u2019s army; indeed, over the course of his rule, Alexander had also been the\ntarget of a number of failed assassinations. However, this mutiny forced Alexander to give in.\nLeaving several of his officers behind as satraps, Alexander turned back. In 323 BCE, he and his\narmy reached Babylon, the city that he had hoped to make the new capital of his world empire.\nThere, Alexander fell ill and died at the ripe old age of thirty-three.\nMap 5.13 | Map of the campaigns and conquests of Alexander\nAuthor: User \u201cIrakliGuna\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nWhile Alexander\u2019s rule only lasted thirteen years, his legacy reshaped Greece and the rest of\nancient Eurasia for the next several centuries. A charismatic leader, albeit one prone to emotional\noutbursts, Alexander redefined what it meant to be king and general. His coinage reflects this\nreinvention. On one coin minted during his lifetime, for instance, appears Alexander dressed as\nPage | 207 the hero Heracles, while Zeus, whom\nAlexander alleged to be his real father,\nappears on the other side.\nIn addition, by conquering\nterritories that were previously not\npart of the Greek world, Alexander\nspread Greek culture farther than had\nanyone else before him. At the same\ntime, by marrying several non-Greek\nprincesses and encouraging such\nFigure 5.18 | Silver coin of Alexander as Heracles\nmarriages by his troops, Alexander also\nAuthor: User \u201cWorld Imaging\u201d\nencouraged the creation of a \u201cmelting- Source: Wikimedia Commons\npot\u201d empire; he further cemented this License: CC BY-SA 3.0\ncreation by founding new cities named\nafter himself all over his new empire. In particular, Alexandria, the city that he founded in Egypt,\nbecame a center of Greek civilization\u2014albeit with an Egyptian twist\u2014was seen as a new Athens\nwell into the Roman Empire. Alexander\u2019s brief time in India produced a significant impact as well,\nas in 321 BCE, Chandragupta Maurya was able to unify India into a single kingdom for the first\ntime, establishing the Mauryan Empire (see Chapter Three). Finally, in the Middle East, North\nAfrica, and the Greek world, Alexander\u2019s generals divided his conquests into several kingdoms\nthat they and their descendants continued to rule until the Romans conquered these respective\nareas. It appears that Alexander\u2019s melting-pot empire, burning up as a phoenix upon his death,\nactually allowed several new empires and kingdoms to arise from its ashes.\n5.11 HELLENISTIC PERIOD\nHistorians today consider the death of Alexander to be the end point of the Classical Period\nand the beginning of the Hellenistic Period. That moment, for historians, also marks the end\nof the polis as the main unit of organization in the Greek world. While city-states continued to\nexist, the main unit of organization from that point on was the great Hellenistic kingdoms. These\nkingdoms, encompassing much greater territory than the Greek world had before Alexander,\ncontributed to the thorough Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.\nThe age of the Hellenistic kingdoms also coincided with the rise of Rome as a military power in the\nWest. Ultimately, the Hellenistic kingdoms were conquered and absorbed by Rome.\n5.11.1 Hellenistic Kingdoms\nAlthough Alexander had several children from his different wives, he did not leave an heir old\nenough to take power upon his death. Indeed, his only son, Alexander IV, was only born several\nmonths after his father\u2019s death. Instead, Alexander\u2019s most talented generals turned against each\nother in a contest for the control of the empire that they had helped create.\nPage | 208 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nMap 5.14 | Map of the Initial partition of Alexander\u2019s empire, before the Wars of the Diadochi\nAuthor: User \u201cFornadan\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nThese Wars of the Diadochi, as they are known in modern scholarship, ended with a\npartition of Alexander\u2019s empire into a number of kingdoms, each ruled by dynasties. Of these,\nthe four most influential dynasties which retained power for the remainder of the Hellenistic Age,\nwere the following: Seleucus, who took control of Syria and the surrounding areas, thus creating\nthe Seleucid Empire; Antigonus Monophthalmos, the One-Eyed, who took over the territory of\nAsia Minor and northern Syria, establishing the Antigonid Dynasty; the Attalid Dynasty, which\ntook power over the Kingdom of Pergamon, after the death of its initial ruler, Lysimachus, a\ngeneral of Alexander; and Ptolemy, Alexander\u2019s most influential general, who took control over\nEgypt, establishing the Ptolemaic Dynasty.\nThe most imperialistic of Alexander\u2019s successors, Seleucus I Nicator took Syria, swiftly\nexpanding his empire to the east to encompass the entire stretch of territory from Syria to India.\nAt its greatest expanse, this territory\u2019s ethnic diversity was similar to that of Alexander\u2019s original\nempire, and Seleucus adopted the same policy of ethnic unity as originally practiced by Alexander;\nsome of Seleucus\u2019 later successors, however, attempted to impose Hellenization on some of the\npeoples under their rule. These successors had difficulties holding on to Seleucus\u2019 conquests. A\nnotable exception, Antiochus III, attempted to expand the Empire into Anatolia and Greece in\nthe early second century BCE but was ultimately defeated by the Romans. The empire\u2019s story\nfor the remainder of its existence is one of almost constant civil wars and increasingly declining\nterritories. The Seleucids seem to have had a particularly antagonistic relationship with their\nJewish subjects, going so far as to outlaw Judaism in 168 BCE. The Jewish holiday Hannukah\ncelebrates a miracle that occurred following the historical victory of the Jews, led by Judah\nPage | 209 Map 5.15 | Map of the Hellenistic Kingdoms c. 303 BCE\nAuthor: User \u201cJavierfv1212\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nMaccabee, over the Seleucids in 165 BCE. Shortly afterwards, the Seleucids had to allow autonomy\nto the Jewish state; it achieved full independence from Seleucid rule in 129 BCE. In 63 BCE, the\nRoman general Pompey finally conquered the small remnant of the Seleucid Empire, making it\ninto the Roman province of Syria.\nAntigonus Monophthalmos, Seleucus\u2019 neighbor, whose holdings included Macedonia, Asia\nMinor, and the northwestern portion of Syria, harbored ambitious plans that rivaled those of\nSeleucus. Antigonus\u2019 hopes of reuniting all of Alexander\u2019s original empire under his own rule,\nhowever, were never realized as Antigonus died in battle in 301 BCE. The greatest threat to the\nAntigonids, however, came not from the Seleucid Empire, but from Rome with whom they waged\nthree Macedonian Wars between 214 and 168 BCE. The Roman defeat of king Perseus in 168 BCE\nat the Battle of Pydna marked the end of the Third Macedonian War, and the end of an era, as\ncontrol over Greece was now in Roman hands.\nThe smallest and least imperialistic of the successor states, the kingdom of Pergamon, was\noriginally part of a very short-lived empire established by Lysimachus, one of Alexander\u2019s generals.\nLysimachus originally held Macedonia and parts of Asia Minor and Thrace but had lost all of these\nterritories by the time of his death in 281 BCE. One of his officers, Philetaerus, however, took over\nthe city of Pergamon, establishing there the Attalid dynasty that transformed Pergamon into a\nsmall and successful kingdom. The final Attalid king, Attalus III, left his kingdom to Rome in his\nwill in 133 BCE.\nLasting from the death of Alexander in 323 BCE to the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BCE, the\nPtolemaic kingdom proved to be the longest lasting and most successful of the kingdoms carved\nfrom Alexander\u2019s initial empire. Its founder, Ptolemy I Soter, was a talented general, as well as\nPage | 210 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nan astronomer, philosopher, and historian, who wrote his own histories of Alexander\u2019s campaigns.\nAiming to make Alexandria the new Athens of the Mediterranean, Ptolemy spared no expense in\nbuilding the Museaum, an institution of learning and research that included, most famously, the\nGreat Library, and worked tirelessly to attract scholars and cultured elite to his city. Subsequent\nPtolemies continued these works so that Alexandria held its reputation as a cultural capital into Late\nAntiquity. One example of a particularly impressive scientific discovery is the work of Eratosthenes,\nthe head librarian at the Great Library in the second half of the third century BCE, who accurately\ncalculated the earth\u2019s circumference. But while the Ptolemies brought with them Greek language and\nculture to Egypt, they were also profoundly influenced by Egyptian customs. Portraying themselves\nas the new Pharaohs, the Ptolemies even adopted the Egyptian royal custom of brother-sister\nmarriages, a practice that eventually percolated down to the general populace as well. Unfortunately,\nbrother-sister marriages did not prevent strife for power within the royal family. The last of the\nPtolemaic rulers, Cleopatra VII, first married and ruled jointly with her brother Ptolemy XIII. After\ndefeating him in a civil war, she then married another brother, Ptolemy XIV, remaining his wife\nuntil his death, possibly from sisterly poisoning. Best known for her affairs with Julius Caesar and,\nafter Caesar\u2019s death, with Marcus Antonius, Cleopatra teamed with Marcus Antonius in a bid for the\nRoman Empire. The last surviving ruler who was descended from one of Alexander\u2019s generals, she\nwas finally defeated by Octavian, the future Roman emperor Augustus, in 30 BCE.\nThe history of the successor states that resulted from the carving of Alexander\u2019s empire shows\nthe imperialistic drive of Greek generals, while also demonstrating the instability of their empires.\nHistorians do not typically engage in counter-factual speculations, but it is very likely that, had\nhe lived longer, Alexander would have seen his empire unravel, as no structure was really in\nplace to hold it together. At the same time, the clash of cultures that Alexander\u2019s empire and\nthe successor states produced resulted in the spread of Greek culture and language further than\never before; simultaneously, it also introduced the Greeks to other peoples, thus bringing foreign\ncustoms\u2014such as the brother-sister marriages in Egypt\u2014into the lives of the Greeks living outside\nthe original Greek world.\n5.11.2 Hellenistic Culture\nThe Hellenistic kingdoms spread Greek language, culture, and art all over the areas of\nAlexander\u2019s former conquests. Furthermore, many Hellenistic kings, especially the Ptolemies,\nwere patrons of art and ideas. Thus the Hellenistic era saw the flourishing of art and architecture,\nphilosophy, medical and scientific writing, and even translations of texts of other civilizations into\nGreek. The undisputed center for these advances was Alexandria.\nCombining the practical with the ambitious, the Pharos, or Lighthouse, of Alexandria was\none of the most famous examples of Hellenistic architecture and has remained a symbol of the city\nto the present day. Constructed in 280 BCE, it was considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of\nthe Ancient World and was one of the tallest buildings in the world at the time. While its practical\npurpose was to guide ships into the harbor at night, it also exemplified the bold advances and\nexperimental spirit of Hellenistic architecture. Indeed, it was located on a man-made mole off the\nPage | 211 coast of the city. The building comprised three\nlayers, the top one of which housed the furnace\nthat produced the light.\nThe structure of the Pharos shows an\ninterest in straight lines and orderly shapes,\nwhile its function symbolized the ability of man\nto subdue the sea, even by night. Similarly,\nboth the scientific and medical texts from the\nHellenistic Period reveal a fascination with an\nordered universe and an interest in discovering\nhow it worked. Herophilus of Chalcedon,\nfor instance, pioneered dissection in the early\nthird BCE and was especially interested in the\nhuman brain and the nervous system. The\nmathematician Euclid, who lived and worked in\nAlexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323 \u2013 Figure 5.19 | The Pharos, or Lighthouse, of\n283 BCE), wrote the Elements, an encyclopedic Alexandria\nAuthor: Emad Victor SHENOUDA\nwork of mathematics that effectively created\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthe discipline of geometry. Going a step further License: \u00a9 Emad Victor SHENOUDA. Used with permission.\nthan Euclid in his research, the third-century\nBCE scientist and inventor Archimedes of\nSyracuse specialized in applying mathematical\nconcepts to create such devices as a screw pump\nand a variety of war machines, including the\nheat ray.\nThe same fascination with studying the\norder of the universe appears in Hellenistic\nphilosophy and stems ultimately from the\nphilosophy of Aristotle (384 \u2013 322 BCE),\nconsidered to be the last Classical Greek\nphilosopher. Aristotle was a prolific polymath,\nwho wrote on political theory, poetry, music,\nand a variety of sciences, to list just some of his\ninterests. Engrossed in seeing all disciplines\nas part of a larger world order, Aristotle\nspecifically argued for empiricism, that is, the\nbelief that knowledge is acquired from sensory\nexperiences rather than from intuition. In the\nFigure 5.20 | The Archimedes Heat Ray\nsciences, for instance, this approach required\nAuthor: User \u201cPbrokos13\u201d\nexperiments and the careful gathering of data. Source: Wikimedia Commons\nWhile Aristotle\u2019s influence on the Hellenistic License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 212 CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST\nphilosophers is undeniable, the alternate theories that some of the philosophers developed\nregarding the structure of the universe and the place of humanity in it differs drastically from\nAristotle\u2019s view. For instance, Skepticism, especially as formulated by Pyrrho in the third\ncentury BCE, argued that it was impossible to reach any accurate conclusions about the world\nand the key to happiness was to stop trying. Cynic philosophers, starting in the fourth century\nBCE, advocated the ascetic life of simplicity and freedom from possessions. A related philosophy,\nStoicism, argued for letting go of all emotions and developing a self-control that would allow one\nto live in accordance to nature. On the other hand, the third-century philosophy of Epicureanism\nargued for the absence of pain as the ultimate goal in life and saw the universe as ruled by random\nchance, separate from the intervention of the gods. All of these philosophies, and many others\nthat co-existed with them, aimed to provide a coherent system that made sense of the world and\nprovided a purpose for human life.\nFinally, in a testament to the deep influence of the Hellenistic language culture on the conquered\nregions, the Hellenistic Period saw the translation of texts of other civilizations into Greek. One\nparticularly influential example was the translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek. Jews\nformed a significant minority of the population of Alexandria, the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt,\nas well as other major cities around the Mediterranean, such as Antioch. By the third century\nBCE, these Jews appear to have largely lost the knowledge of Hebrew; thus, a translation of the\nsacred texts into Greek was necessary. In addition, as later legend has it, Ptolemy II Philadelphus\nallegedly commissioned seventy-two scholars to translate the Old Testament into Greek for his\nRoyal Library. Whether indeed solicited by Ptolemy II or not, the translation was likely completed\nover the course of the third throughfirst centuries BCE. Named after the legendary seventy-two\n(or, in some versions, seventy) translators, the text was titled the Septuagint. The completion\nof this translation showed the thorough Hellenization of even the Jews, who had largely kept\nthemselves apart from mainstream culture of the cities in which they lived.\n5.12 CONCLUSION\n\u201cCaptive Greece has conquered her rude conqueror,\u201d the Roman poet Horace famously wrote\nin the late first century BCE. This comment about the deep influence of Greek culture on the\nRoman world, even after the Roman conquest of Greece was complete, continued to be the case\nwell after the days of Horace. Ultimately, the impact of the Hellenization of the Mediterranean\nand the Middle East, which started with Alexander\u2019s conquests, lasted far beyond the Hellenistic\nkingdoms, as the Greek language continued to be the language of the Eastern Roman Empire\nand, subsequently, the Byzantine Empire up until the conquest of that territory by the Ottomans\nin 1453 CE. In some respects, this spread of the Greeks and their civilization ultimately changed\nwhat it meant to be Greek\u2013or, rather, it created a more universal Greek identity, which largely\nreplaced the polis-specific view of citizenship and identity that existed before Philip\u2019s conquest of\nGreece. And yet, certain cultural constants persisted.\nThe first of these was Homer, whose epics continued to be as great an inspiration to the Greeks\nof the Roman world as they were to their Archaic Age counterparts. For instance, the Homeric\nPage | 213 values were likely the reason for the minimal advances in military technology in the Greek world,\nas honor was more important than military success at all cost. The second cultural constant was\nthe work of the philosophers Plato and Aristotle, in whose shadows all subsequent philosophers\nof the Greco-Roman world labored. Even as the Greek-speaking portions of the Roman Empire\nturned to Christianity, they could not abandon their philosophical roots, resulting, for instance,\nin the Gnostic heresies. Horace\u2019s cheeky comment thus proved to be true far longer than he could\nhave expected.\n5.13 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBurkert, Walter.

As the\nRoman historian Livy tells it, Cincinnatus, the senator who was appointed dictator, received\nthe news while working on his farm. Abandoning the plow, he immediately rushed to join the\narmy, which he then led to a swift and brilliant victory. Then something astonishing happened:\nCincinnatus resigned his extraordinary powers and returned to his farm. For the remainder\nof the Roman Republic, and well into the Imperial Period, Cincinnatus continued to be seen\nas the quintessential Roman cultural hero and model of virtue: an aristocratic man who was\nPage | 217 a talented soldier, general, and\npolitician who put the interests\nof Rome first, above his own.\nWhile no other Roman politician\ndisplayed Cincinnatus\u2019 degree\nof self-sacrificing humility,\nthe other Roman heroes of\nthe Republic and the Empire\nwere still uniformly male, pre-\ndominantly aristocratic, and\nfamed for military and political\nachievements.\nBut something happened\nto give rise to a rather different\nsort of cultural hero by the Late\nRoman Empire. In 203 CE, a Figure 6.1 | Cincinnatus leaves the plow to accept the dictatorship\nAuthor: User \u201cAntonius Proximo\u201d\nyoung noblewoman and her\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nslave were executed in Carthage, License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nthrown into the arena with the\nlions. Their crime? A stubborn faith: the belief that a Jewish man who lived in Judaea a century\nearlier was the son of God who had died on the cross and rose again. Eager to emulate his\nsuffering in order to win eternal life with their God, the two women, Perpetua and Felicity,\ngave up a life of relative comfort and the chance to raise their babies\u2014indeed, Felicity gave birth\nin prison mere hours before her execution!\u2014placing their God above all else. They were not\nthe only ones. Stories of martyrs abound in the Later Roman Empire and were told repeatedly\nby Christians, thus perpetuating the status of these martyrs as the new cultural heroes. But far\nfrom repelling others from imitating their example, these stories, rather, encouraged the rise of\nmore willing martyrs to follow their suit. As a result of the spread of Christianity, therefore, the\nRoman cultural heroes of Late Antiquity were a far cry from Cincinnatus. Instead of aristocratic\ngenerals and politicians, they were nursing mothers and even slave-women who chose to die a\nhumiliating and painful death for their faith and its promise of an eternal reward.\nThe story of the Roman world from the foundation of the city of Rome and to the fall of the\nRoman Empire in the West is, overall, a tale of two different transformations. The first of these\nis the dramatic transformation in cultural values and beliefs, a glimpse of which is reflected in\nthe two stories above. The second is a similarly dramatic geographical transformation, which\nalso brought about drastic clashes of cultures and a variety of changes throughout the entire\nMediterranean world and beyond, that is, the transformation of a small village on the Tiber into\none of the largest empires in all of world history, followed by a collapse of a part of that Empire,\nbut a collapse from whose ashes arose what we now know as Europe.\nPage | 218 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\n6.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

Set sixteen miles inland, the original settlement had distinct strategic\nadvantages: it was immune to attacks from the sea, and the seven hills on which the city was built\nwere easy to fortify. The Tiber, although marshy and prone to flooding, furthermore, provided\nthe ability to trade with the neighboring city-states. By the mid-Republic, requiring access to the\nsea, the Romans built a harbor at Ostia, which grew to become a full-fledged commercial arm\nof Rome as a result. Wheeled vehicles were prohibited inside the city of Rome during the day, in\norder to protect the heavy pedestrian traffic. Thus at night, carts from Ostia poured into Rome,\ndelivering food and other goods for sale from all over Italy and the Empire.\nOne of the most surprising aspects of the history of early Rome is that, despite constant threats\nfrom its more powerful neighbors, it was never swallowed by them. The Etruscans dominated\nmuch of northern Italy down to Rome, while the southern half of Italy was so heavily colonized\nby the Greeks as to earn the nickname \u201cMagna Graecia,\u201d meaning \u201cGreat Greece.\u201d In addition,\nseveral smaller tribes hemmed the early Romans, mainly, the Latins, the Aequi, and the Sabines.\n1 Mary Boatwright, Daniel Gargola, Noel Lenski, and Richard Talbert. The Romans: From Village to Empire: A History of\nRome from Earliest Times to the End of the Western Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011).\nPage | 221 The topography of Rome\u2014the advantage\nof the hills and the river\u2014likely was a boon in\nthe city\u2019s struggles against all of its neighbors.\nLikewise, the topography of Italy proper, with\nthe Alps and the Appenines providing natural\ndefenses in the north, hampered invasions\nfrom the outside. Indeed, the most famous\nexample of an invasion from the north, that\nof Hannibal during the Second Punic War, is\na case in point: he selected that challenging\nroute through the Alps in order to surprise the\nRomans, and it proved even more destructive\nfor his forces than he had anticipated.\nAs Rome built a Mediterranean empire,\nthe city itself grew increasingly larger,\nMap 6.1 | Map of the Seven Hills of Rome reaching a population of one million by 100\nAuthor: User \u201cRenata3\u201d CE. While Italy boasted fertile farmlands,\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nfeeding the city of Rome became a challenge\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nthat required the resources of the larger\nempire, and Egypt in particular became\nknown as the breadbasket of Rome. As a\nresult, emperors were especially cautious to\ncontrol access to Egypt by prominent senators\nand other politicians, for fear of losing control\nover this key area of the Empire.\nDuring the rule of the emperor Trajan\nin the early second century CE, the Roman\nEmpire reached its greatest extent, stretching\nto Britain in the west, slightly beyond the Rhine\nand Danube river in the north, and including\nmuch of the Near East and north Africa.\nTopography, however, played a role in\nthe Romans\u2019 ultimately unsuccessful struggle\nto hold on to these territories after Trajan\u2019s\ndeath. The natural frontier offered by the\nRhine and Danube rivers made it difficult for\nthe Romans to maintain control over the ter-\nritories on the other side of them.

Finally, a persisting challenge for Roman emperors was that of the location of the\nempire\u2019s capital. When the Roman Empire consisted of Italy alone, the location of Rome in the\nmiddle of the Italian peninsula was the ideal location for the capital. Once, however, the empire\nbecame a Mediterranean empire that controlled areas far in all directions, the location of Rome\nwas a great distance from all the problem frontiers. As a result, emperors over the course of the\nsecond and third centuries spent increasingly less time in Rome. Finally, Diocletian\u2019s split of the\nEmpire in 293 CE into four administrative regions, each with a regional capital, left Rome out, and\nin 330 CE, the emperor Constantine permanently moved the capital of the empire to his new city\nof Constantinople, built at the site of the older Greek city of Byzantium.\nThe large area encompassed by the empire required a sophisticated infrastructure of roads\nand sea routes, and the Romans provided both. By the first century CE, these roads and routes\nconnected the center of the empire (Rome) to the periphery, providing ways for armies, politi-\ncians, traders, tourists, and students to travel with greater security and speed than ever before.\nAs primary sources reveal, travel was never a fully safe undertaking, as bandits lurked on roads\nand pirates on seas, greedy locals were always eager to fleece unsuspecting tourists, and ship-\nwrecks were an unfortunately common reality. Still, the empire created an unprecedented degree\nPage | 223 of networks and connections that allowed anyone in one part of the empire to be able to travel to\nany other part, provided he was wealthy enough to be able to afford the journey.\n6.6 BASIC CHRONOLOGY AND PERIODS OF ROMAN HISTORY\nAccording to Roman tradition, Rome was founded as a monarchy. That monarchy, however,\nwas not long-lived, and its history is overshadowed by myth and legend. Historians of Rome have\nmost often divided its history into two major periods, based on the type of government that Rome\nhad at the time: the Republic (from the late sixth century BCE to the late first century BCE) and\nthe Empire (from the late first century BCE to the fall of the Western half of the empire in the\nlate fifth century CE). Indeed, as seen in the writings of the Roman historian Tacitus, already as\nearly as the late first century CE, Romans themselves thought of their history in terms of those\ntwo periods. The basic difference between the two periods is quite simple. During the period of\nthe Republic, Rome was ruled by a Republican government, which distributed power, in theory,\namong all Roman citizens. In practice, this was really an aristocratic oligarchy. By contrast, under\nthe Empire, Rome was under one ruler, the Emperor.\nRecent research, however, has challenged the over-simplification of Roman history that can\nbe implied by thinking of it as comprising just two periods. The work of Harriet Flower has shown\nthat the Roman Republic is best conceived of as a series of Republics, each with distinct features.\nThe work of Peter Brown, furthermore, has challenged the myth of the \u201cdecline and fall\u201d of the\nRoman Empire, first popularized by Edward Gibbon, a nineteenth-century British historian of\nRome. Brown has shown that as a result of the Christianization of the Roman world, Roman\nculture in the Late Empire was quite different from that in the earlier periods, yet it was very\nmuch a flourishing culture.\nThis chapter proceeds chronologically, sub-dividing both the Republic and the Empire into\nearly and late periods, while also devoting some attention to certain thematic topics that are key\nto understanding each period.\n6.7 SOURCES AND PROBLEMS\nOne of the greatest challenges to modern historians of Rome is the Romans\u2019 own seeming\nlack of interest in writing their own history for their first 600 years. While, according to Roman\nlegend, Rome was founded in 753 BCE, the first Roman history in Latin, Origins, composed\nby the Republican politician Cato the Elder, was not published until 149 BCE. A few senators\nhad written about Roman history in Greek earlier on, and some aristocrats kept family histories,\nbut Cato\u2019s work was truly the first Roman history on a large scale, as it narrated events from the\nfoundation of the city to Cato\u2019s own death. Only fragments of Cato\u2019s history survive; they reveal\nthat Cato\u2019s approach to the writing of history was rather unusual. Instead of referring to any indi-\nviduals throughout Roman history by name, Cato referred to them by title or political position. As\na result, his history was truly focused on Rome and aimed to glorify the accomplishments of Rome\nrather than individual Romans. Thankfully for modern historians, Cato\u2019s experiment of nameless\nPage | 224 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nhistory did not catch on with subsequent Roman historians. Modern historians are able to recon-\nstruct the story of the Romans from a variety of written and archaeological sources, but some of\nthese sources present problems of which the historian must be aware. Similarly to the challenges\nmodern historians face when studying Greek history, historians of Rome must at times engage in\neducated guessing when attempting to reconstruct a picture of Rome and Romans based on the\nlimited evidence that is available.\nBecause the genre of historical writing started so late in Rome, few histories survive from the\nperiod of the Republic. Of these, the most famous (and the most voluminous) is the work of Livy,\nwho wrote his Ab Urbe Condita (From the Foundation of the City) in the late first century BCE.\nLivy was very much an \u201carmchair historian,\u201d but he appears to have had access to a number of\nsources that are now lost, such as family histories from a number of aristocratic families. As the\ntitle indicates, Livy began his work with the legends about the founding of Rome. He continued his\nnarrative down to his time, the age of Augustus, and the last known events in his work covered the\nyear 9 BCE. Although Livy\u2019s work consisted of 142 books, only about a quarter survives, including\nthe first ten books, covering the regal period and the early republic and the narrative of the first two\nPunic Wars. Other prominent historians of the Republic whose works survive include Sallust, a con-\ntemporary of Caesar who turned to writing moralistic history after a frustrating political career, and\nCaesar himself, who wrote two books about his own campaigns: the Gallic Wars, about his conquest\nof Gaul in the 50\u2019s BCE, and the Civil War, about his civil war against Pompey in 49 \u2013 45 BCE.\nThe works of two prominent historians survive from the period of the Roman Empire. Tacitus,\nanother politician-turned-historian, wrote in the early second century CE two works about the\nhistory of the Roman Empire in its first century of existence. The Annals covered the rule of the\nemperors Tiberius through Nero, while the Histories continued the narrative to the rule of the\nemperor Domitian. Significant portions of both works survive. Ammianus Marcellinus, a military\nofficer writing in the late fourth century CE, saw himself as a successor of Tacitus, and composed a\nmassive history of the Roman Empire from the end of Tacitus\u2019 work to his own day. In addition, the\nsensationalizing biographer Suetonius, a contemporary of Tacitus, composed tabloid-style biog-\nraphies of the first twelve emperors (from Caesar to Domitian). The anonymous Historia Augusta,\ncomposed sometime in the late Empire, provides similarly sensationalizing biographies of Roman\nemperors and some usurpers from Hadrian in the early second century CE to Carinus in the late third\ncentury CE.\nIn addition to these Roman historians and biographers, a number of historical works in Greek\nsurvive from the late Republic and the Empire that cover topics related to Roman history. To\nmention just a few examples, in the late first century BCE, Diodorus of Sicily wrote a massive\nuniversal history that includes key events of Roman history, alongside Greek history and mythology.\nThe Greek biographer Plutarch, writing in the first century CE, paired for the sake of compari-\nson biographies of famous Greeks and Romans; one exemplary such pairing is that of Alexander\nthe Great and Julius Caesar. Josephus, a Jewish rebel leader turned Roman citizen, wrote the\nJewish War, a detailed account of the disastrous Jewish revolt against Rome in the 60\u2019s CE.\nWorks of history, however, are only one type of source that modern historians of Rome\nuse. Other written sources include poems, novels, letters of politicians and other prominent\nPage | 225 figures, military and farming manuals, cookbooks, etc. For instance, one of the best sources for\nthe political ideology of the Augustan age is Vergil\u2019s epic poem Aeneid, which tells the story\nof the Trojan hero Aeneas and his struggle to reach Italy after the fall of Troy to found Rome.\nArguably the single best source for everyday life in the Roman provinces under the Empire is\nApuleius\u2019 novel Metamorphoses, better known under the title Golden Ass. The novel is\na fictional account of a man accidentally turned into a donkey, who tells the narrative of his\ntravels through the Roman Empire in the late second century CE. And one of the best sources\nfor the government of Roman provinces is the correspondence of Pliny the Younger, governor of\nthe province of Bithynia on the shores of the Black Sea in 111 \u2013 113 CE, with the emperor Trajan.\nTo say the least, the job of the provincial governor, based on these letters, appears to have been\ndecidedly unglamorous.\nEarly Christianity is one area of Roman history that has been especially well documented from its\ninception. The New Testament is an invaluable source, as it presents sources by early Christians about\ntheir own faith and its spread throughout the Roman Empire. A variety of popular heretical texts from\nthe second and third centuries also survives and allows historians to reconstruct some of the dissent-\ning views held in the early church. Writings in Greek and Latin by a\nnumber of influential figures in the early church, dubbed the Church\nFathers, document the theological debates that resulted ultimately\nin the Nicene Creed. Starting in the second century CE, martyrdom\naccounts and saints\u2019 lives provide admittedly semi-fictional and\nstylized biographies of individual believers. Finally, two prominent\ntheologians in the Late Empire attempted to write (or re-write) Roman\nhistory specifically through a Christian lens. Eusebius, the Bishop of\nCaesarea in the fourth century CE, wrote the History of the Church,\nfocusing on the history of Christianity from its beginnings to his day.\nThen in the early fifth century CE, Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in\nNorth Africa, wrote the City of God, a massive work covering history\nand legends of Rome from its beginnings to his day, in an attempt to\nshow that Rome\u2019s previous successes were due not to adherence to the\npagan gods, but instead always to the Christian God\u2019s mercy.\nIn addition to written sources of various kinds, archaeological\nsources provide further insight into Roman life in different periods.\nExamples of sources that survive include inscriptions, especially\ngravestones; traded goods, such as lamps or bricks, which allow\nFigure 6.2 | Reconstructed\nhistorians to reconstruct the movement of goods across the empire;\nRoman Tombstone |\nand a number of Roman towns and military camps.

The tragedy for the Roman residents of the two towns at the time proved\nto be a modern archaeologist\u2019s dream.\nWhile, as the above summary shows, abundant sources of different types survive from different\nperiods of Roman history, certain perspectives are difficult to reconstruct from our sources. For\ninstance, slaves in the Roman world were as archaeologically invisible as in the Greek world.\nLikewise, very little evidence documents women\u2019s lives before the rise of Christianity, and their\nvoices are largely left out from Roman history. Other than epitaphs on their gravestones, most\naverage Romans, in general, left no record of their lives, so our evidence is dominated by the\nhistory of the aristocracy. Still, the careful historian can gain at least some insight into these\nlesser-documented perspectives by gathering all references to them in sources that survive.\n6.8 EARLY AND MIDDLE REPUBLIC\nThe period from the founding of Rome to the end of the Punic Wars is less documented than\nsubsequent Roman history. Nevertheless, this period was the formative time during which Rome\ngrew from a village on the Tiber to a pan-Mediterranean empire.\nPage | 227 The process was as fascinating\nto consider for later Romans as\nfor outsiders. The Greek politi-\ncian-turned-historian Polybius,\nwho spent seventeen years as a\nhostage in Rome and became quite\na fan of the Roman military and\npolitical machine, put it simply in\nthe prologue to his Histories, in\nwhich he documented the meteoric\nconquest of the Mediterranean\nworld by the Romans:\nFor who is so worthless or\nlazy as not to wish to know\nby what means and under\nwhat system of govern-\nment the Romans in less\nthan fifty-three years have\nsucceeded in subjugating\nnearly the entire known\nworld to their rule, an Map 6.4 | Map of the Roman Conquest of Italy | Stages of Early\nachievement unprecedented Roman Expansion from 500 BCE to 218 BCE.\nAuthor: User \u201cJavierfv1212\u201d\nin history? (Polybius 1.1.5)\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPolybius\u2019 question pointed\nto the answer that he subsequently proposed: part of the reason for the Romans\u2019 success was their\nadoption of the Republican government as replacement for their original monarchy. Polybius\nbecame increasingly convinced during his stay in Rome that the Romans\u2019 government was\nsuperior to all others in the Mediterranean at the time.\n6.8.1 From Monarchy to Republic: Some Myths and Legends\n\u201cIn the beginning, kings held Rome.\u201d Thus the late first-century CE Roman historian Tacitus\nopened his Annals, a history of the Empire under the rule of the emperors from Tiberius to Nero.\nEarly Roman history is shrouded in myth and legend, but the beliefs of later Romans about their\nown past are important to consider, as these beliefs, whether truly grounded in reality or not,\ndetermined subsequent decisions and actions of the historical Romans later on. This tendency is\nespecially true of the Romans\u2019 myths about the foundation of their city in 753 BCE and the kings\nwho ruled it until the establishment of the Republic in 510 BCE.\nAccording to myth, Rome received its name from its founder Romulus, the son of the war\ngod Mars, and a descendant of the Trojan hero Aeneas. By linking themselves to the Trojans,\nPage | 228 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nthe Romans were able to boast an ancient, reputable lineage, rivaling that of the Greeks, and\na prominent place in the Greek heroic epic, Homer\u2019s Iliad. Furthermore, when embarking on\na conquest of Greece later on, the Romans could claim to be seeking revenge for their Trojan\nancestors\u2019 defeat and destruction by the Greeks during the Trojan War. Several generations\nremoved from their heroic ancestor Aeneas, Romulus and his twin brother Remus were famously\nabandoned as infants and then nursed by a she-wolf, the sacred animal of their father Mars.\nThe sweetness of the story ends there, however. While Romulus was building Rome, Remus\ninsulted the new city, and his brother killed him to avenge its honor. Later, after Romulus had\ncompleted the building of the new city with his band of soldiers, he realized the lack of women in\nthe city, so Romulus and his supporters raided the neighboring tribe, the Sabines, and kidnapped\ntheir women.\nIt is telling that later Romans believed that their city was founded on fraternal bloodshed, as\nwell as on rape and kidnapping. The stories of Romulus\u2019 accomplishments, while not laudatory,\nshow an important Roman belief: the greatness of Rome sometimes required morally reprehen-\nsible actions. In other words, Rome came first, and if the good of the city required the sacrifice of\none\u2019s brother, or required force against others, then the gods were still on the side of the Romans\nand ordained these actions.\nRomans believed that, altogether, their city was ruled by seven different kings in succession.\nAfter Romulus, king Numa Pompilius regulated Roman religion and created many of the priestly\ncolleges and positions that continued to exist thereafter. The seventh and final king, however,\nTarquin the Proud, was known for his and his family\u2019s brutality. The final straw appears of\nhave been the rape of a nobleman\u2019s wife, Lucretia, by the king\u2019s son. An aristocratic revolu-\ntion ensued, which appears to have\nbeen largely bloodless, if Livy\u2019s\naccount is to be trusted. The royal\nfamily was expelled from the city,\nand two consuls were immediately\nelected to govern the newly formed\nRepublic. Or so, again, Livy tells\nus, based on Roman legend. The\nreality is likely to have been more\ncomplicated. Assuming there truly\nwere seven kings who ruled the\ncity, and assuming that the last of\nthem was driven out by an aristo-\ncratic revolution, it appears that\na period of transition ensued, as\nthe Romans experimented with\nFigure 6.4 | She-Wolf Suckles Romulus and Remus | You can\na variety of short-term solutions see a replica of this statue in Rome, Georgia.\nbefore arriving at the model of the Author: User \u201cNyenyec\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nRepublican government that we\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 229 know in the historical period. Furthermore, apparently what guided that gradual evolution of the\ngovernment was the growing dissatisfaction of the plebeians, the lower socio-economic majority\nof the city, with their exclusion from the political process.\n6.8.2 Early Republic: Conflict of Orders, the Twelve Tables, and\nKey Legislations\nRoman sources from all periods, beginning already in the early Republic, reveal certain\ncommon values that all Romans held dear and considered to be foundational for their state. First,\nRomans had a strong respect for the past and were averse to change. Indeed, reformers had a\ndifficult time passing their proposals in all periods of Roman history. The term for this reverence\nfor the past, mos maiorum, \u201ccustom of ancestors\u201d or \u201ccustom of elders,\u201d is telling. While innova-\ntion is a revered value in the modern world, Romans believed that innovation amounted to disre-\nspect for their ancestors. Ancestral custom, which had first made Rome great, had to be respected,\nand successful reformers, such as the emperor Augustus, managed to phrase their reforms as a\nreturn to something old, rather than as something new. Three additional values that are key to\nunderstanding the Romans are auctoritas, \u201cpower\u201d or \u201cauthority;\u201d dignitas, roughly meaning\n\u201cdignity;\u201d and gravitas, \u201cseriousness.\u201d Each citizen in the state had a degree of auctoritas, that\nintangible quality that made others obey him, but the degree of auctoritas varied, depending\non one\u2019s social and political standing. Augustus, Rome\u2019s first emperor, would later describe his\nposition in the state as having more auctoritas than anyone\nelse. The other two qualities, dignitas and gravitas, were\nconnected and reflected one\u2019s bearing and behavior as a true\nRoman. Jocularity was not valued, but seriousness reflected\na particularly Roman conduct and determination. It is\nstriking that Romans never smiled in portraits. The austere\nfacial expression, instead, conveyed their power and superi-\nority to others, whom they had conquered.\nWhile sharing common values, Romans were also\ndeeply aware of social divisions between themselves. From\nits earliest time, Roman citizen population was divided into\ntwo orders: the patricians, defined as the descendants\nfrom the first one hundred senators appointed to the Roman\naristocratic Senate by king Romulus, and the plebeians,\nthat is, everyone who was not a patrician. The plebeians\nhad their own political assembly, the Plebeian Council,\nwhile all Roman citizens also belonged to the Centuriate\nAssembly, which was responsible for annual elections\nFigure 6.5 | Bust of an austere\nfor top political offices. The period of the early Republic,\nRoman, possibly Cato the Elder\nAuthor: User \u201cShakko\u201d following the expulsion of the kings, was a time of conflict for\nSource: Wikimedia Commons the two orders, as patricians tried to establish a government\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 230 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nthat reserved all political power to themselves, whereas the plebeians fought for the opportunity\nto hold political and religious offices. Although they did not wield any political power at first,\nthey discovered in the early fifth century that their most powerful weapon was secession, that is,\ndeparture en masse from the city, until the patricians acquiesced to a demand. While much about\nthe Conflict of the Orders\u2014just as anything else about the history of the early Republic\u2014is\nshrouded in legend, it is possible to track its progress through the evidence of legislations that the\nRomans passed.\nIn 494 BCE, following the first plebeian secession, the Roman Senate allowed the plebeians\nto elect plebeian tribunes. An office that eventually was reserved for senators, it was originally\nmerely an opportunity for plebeians to elect officers in the Plebeian Council, the assembly of all\nplebeian citizens, who would advocate for them. Plebeians next appear to have advocated for a\npublic display of the laws, in order to protect the poor during lawsuits. The result was the first\nRoman legal code, the Twelve Tables, which was inscribed on twelve tables c. 450 BCE and\ndisplayed in public. One of the laws included was a ban on intermarriage between plebeians and\npatricians, showing a clear commitment on the part of the patricians to maintain the separa-\ntion of the orders. It is important to note, however, that with the gradual decline in the number\nof patrician families over the course of the Roman Republic, most began to intermarry with\nprominent plebeian families.\nThe highest political office in the Republic, that of the consul, continued to be reserved solely\nfor patricians until 367 BCE, when two senators sponsored the Licinian-Sextian law. The law\nrequired that one of the two consuls elected each year had to be plebeian. The phrasing of the law\nwas significant, as it allowed the possibility that both consuls elected in a particular year could be\nplebeian, although this event did not happen in reality until 215 BCE. Finally, the legislation that\nmodern historians have considered to have ended the early Republican Conflict of the Orders is\nthe Lex Hortensia of 287 BCE. This law made all legislations passed by the Plebeian Council\nbinding on all Romans, patricians and plebeians alike.\nAs historians connect the dots in the story of the Conflict of the Orders through these legisla-\ntions, one trend that emerges is the gradual weakening of the patricians along with the growing\ninfluence of the plebeians on Roman government. Indeed, by the third century, a number of\nplebeian families were as wealthy and successful as patrician families, whereas some old patrician\nfamilies had fallen on hard times.\n6.8.3 Cursus Honorum and Roman Religion\nThe debate over plebeian access to political offices in general, and to the consulship in par-\nticular, resulted in the creation of a rigid cursus honorum, a sequence or ladder of political\noffices. The ultimate dream of every Roman who entered politics was to become a consul, but the\nnarrowing pyramid that was the cursus honorum stood in his path. All offices were held for the\nterm of one year, and, in order to prevent any one individual from amassing too much power,\ncandidates had to wait ten years between consulships. Finally, each office had a minimum age\nrequirement, with a special privilege for patricians to subtract two years from that minimum.\nPage | 231 The prerequisite for holding any political office was ten years of military service. Thus, aspiring\nRoman politicians normally entered the army around eighteen years of age. Following ten years of\ndistinguished service, candidates who were at least thirty years of age were allowed to run for the\nfirst office in the cursus: the quaestorship. The number of quaestors each year rose over time to\ntwenty by the late Republic. Each quaestor was assigned to a particular duty for his year in office,\nvarying from supervising the coin mint in Rome to serving as an assistant to a provincial governor\nor a consul in charge of a war.\nWhile not officially part of the required cursus honorum, most ex-quaestors next ran for the\noffice of the plebeian tribune, if they were plebeian, or an aedile. Ten plebeian tribunes were\nelected each year and were supposed to advocate for the benefit of the plebeians during Senatorial\ndebates. Aediles\u2014a term derived from the Latin \u201caedes,\u201d meaning \u201cbuilding\u201d or \u201ctemple\u201d\u2014were in\ncharge of public building projects and often also sponsored public entertainment.\nThe next step in the cursus was the praetorship. Similarly to the quaestors, the number of\npraetors rose over time, until topping at eight in the late Republic. Praetors could hold imperium,\nthe right to command an army; thus, they often served in military roles or in administrative\ncapacity by governing a province. Finally, one praetor each year, the praetor urbanus, was in\ncharge of administering justice in the city of Rome and keeping track of legal cases and important\ndecisions, which he issued at the end of the year as the Praetor\u2019s Edict.\nUpon reaching the age of forty, candidates who had successfully held the praetorship ultimate-\nly could run for the consulship. Two consuls were elected annually, and this position change to\n\u201coffice\u201d was the pinnacle of the Roman political career. Aristocratic families kept for centuries on\ndisplay in their homes the ancestor masks of members of the family who had been consuls. Since\nten years were required to elapse between successive consulships, very few individuals ever held\nmore than one consulship, until several politicians in the late Republic broke the rules altogether.\nLast but not least, one additional office existed, for which ex-consuls could run: every five years,\ntwo censors were elected for a period of eighteen months for the purpose of conducting the\ncensus of citizens. While this structure of annually-elected offices was designed to prevent any\none individual from usurping all political power in the state, the Senate also realized that, on rare\noccasions, concentrating all power in one set of hands was needed. Thus the Senate could appoint\na dictator for a non-renewable period of six months in times of serious military emergency, such\nas in the already-mentioned case of Cincinnatus.\nThe cursus honorum is best visualized as a pyramid with a wide base and narrowing each step\non the way up. While twenty men each year were elected to the quaestorship, only a fraction of\nthem could ever achieve the praetorship, and a yet smaller fraction could rise to the consulship.\nStill, election to the quaestorship secured life-long membership in the Senate, the governing body\nof roughly 300 politicians\u2014doubled in the first century BCE to 600\u2014who effectively governed\nRome under the Republic. The question remains, nevertheless: how did some men achieve\npolitical advancement while others never made it past the quaestorship? Part of the key to success,\nit appears, lay outside of politics proper, belonging instead to the realm of religion.\nRoman religion, similarly to Greek, was traditionally polytheistic, with many myths and gods\naligned to the Greek counterparts. Zeus, Greek king of the gods, became Jupiter, and was a patron\nPage | 232 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\ngod of Rome under the title Jupiter\nOptimus Maximus, or Jupiter the\nBest and the Greatest.\nHis consort, Hera, became the\nRoman goddess Juno and was\nthe patron goddess of marriage.\nThe Greek Athena became Roman\nMinerva and was the patron divinity\nof women\u2019s crafts. In addition, both\nVenus, the goddess of love, and\nMars, the god of war, had mythical\nfamily connections to Rome\u2019s human\nfounders. Countless other divinities\nFigure 6.6 | The Capitoline Triad | Jupiter Optimus Maximus,\nabounded as well; even the Roman\nwith Juno and Minerva (known together as the Capitoline Triad).\nNote Juno\u2019s sacred goose at her foot, and Minerva\u2019s sacred owl sewer system, Cloaca Maxima, had\nnext to her. its own patron goddess, Cloacina.\nAuthor: User \u201cLuiclemens\u201d\nWhile Romans were expected\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 to worship some of the gods in\nprivate, often making vows to them\nand promising gifts if the gods fulfilled a request, Roman religion also had a significant public\ncomponent that was reserved for the priestly colleges. Although not limited to politicians, mem-\nbership in these colleges was at times key for political advancement. One example of this phenom-\nenon in action is the career of Julius Caesar, whose political career took off after his appointment\nto the religious office of pontifex maximus, head of Roman religion. Ultimately, both public\nand private religion aimed at the same goal: keeping the pax deorum, peace with the gods, upon\nwhich the success of their state rested, as the Romans believed. Put simply, as long as Romans\nmaintained a respectful peace with their gods, they ensured Rome\u2019s success. Whenever any\ndisasters befell the state, however, Romans typically assumed that pax deorum had been violated\nin some way. The gods then had to be appeased in order to end the disaster and prevent similar\nevents from occurring in the future.\n6.8.4 Roman Expansion to the End of the Punic Wars\nWhile the legends about the kings of Rome suggest that they had significant military respon-\nsibilities, it appears that their military actions were largely defensive. Just a decade or so after\nthe expulsion of the kings, shortly after 500 BCE, however, Roman expansion began in earnest.\nIt is important to note here several key features of the early Roman military. First, until the\nlate Republic, Rome did not maintain a standing army. Rather, a new army was raised for each\ncampaign, and campaigns were typically launched in the spring and ended in the fall. The festival\nof the October Horse, one of the religious festivals the Romans celebrated each year, involved a\nritual purification of the cavalry and originally was likely designed as the end point of the campaign\nPage | 233 season. Also, similarly to the Greek world, the Romans had minimum wealth requirements for\nmilitary service, since soldiers supplied their own equipment. Finally, one significant trend to\nnote in early Republican military history is the repeated nature of Roman conflicts with the same\nenemies, such as the three Samnite Wars, the three Punic Wars, and the four Macedonian\nWars. This repetition suggests that, for whatever reason, the Romans did not aim to annihilate\ntheir opponents, unless absolutely pressed to do so.\nIt appears that the Roman expansion in the 490s BCE began as a defensive measure. In either\n499 BCE or 496 BCE, the expelled seventh king of Rome, Tarquin the Proud, joined forces with\nthe Latin League, a group of about thirty city-states around the area of Rome, and led them to\nattack the Romans. The result was the Battle of Lake Regillus, a decisive victory for Rome.\nThe Romans signed an uneasy peace treaty with the Latins, but war broke out again in 340 \u2013 338\nBCE. The Roman victory this time resulted in the absorption of the Latin city-states into Rome as\npartial citizens.\nThe Latins were not the only enemies the nascent Roman Republic had to face. Romans fought\nand gradually conquered the Etruscan city-states to the north. One especially significant victory\nwas over the powerful Etruscan city of Veii in 396 BCE. A legend preserved by Livy states that\nRomans were only able to conquer Veii after they performed the ceremony of evocation, \u201ccalling\nout.\u201d Fearing that their siege of Veii was not going well because Juno, the patron goddess of Veii,\nwas not on their side, the Romans called Juno out of Veii; they promised her a nice new temple in\nRome if she would switch sides. Shortly thereafter, the city fell to the Romans. When the Roman\nsoldiers were packing up the cult statue of Juno from her temple in Veii for transportation to\nRome, a cheeky Roman soldier asked Juno if she wanted to come to Rome. The statue enthusias-\ntically nodded her head. Livy\u2019s history is full of similar tales of divine providence intervening on\nthe side of the Romans. These legends show the Romans\u2019 own belief that throughout the process\nof expansion, the gods had protected them and guided them to success.\nWhile still fighting the Latins, the Romans\nembarked upon what turned out to be a series\nof three wars with their neighbors to the east,\nthe Samnites. Each of these wars, the last of\nwhich ended in 290 BCE, resulted in Roman\nterritorial gains; by the end of the Third Samnite\nWar, Rome controlled all of central Italy. It also\nappears that, at some point during the Samnite\nWars, the Romans switched from fighting in the\nGreek hoplite phalanx fashion to a system of\ntheir own making, the manipular legion. This\nnew system apparently allowed more flexibility\nFigure 6.7 | Two Roman Infantrymen and a\nin the arrangement of the troops on the battle-\nCavalryman, second century BCE\nfield; it also allowed using both heavy and light Author: User \u201cColderEel\u201d\ninfantry as needed, instead of keeping them in Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\na static formation for the duration of a battle.\nPage | 234 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nWhile not much else is\nknown about the manipular\nlegion, it appears to have\nbeen an effective system for\nthe Romans for much of the\nRepublican period.\nIt is striking to consider\nthat the Romans spent\neighty of the hundred years\nin the third century BCE\nat war. They did not seem\nto have had the ambition\nto conquer the Greek\ncity-states who were their\nneighbors in southern Italy;\nin 280 \u2013 275 BCE, Rome nev-\nertheless became embroiled\nin a war with Pyrrhus,\nking of Epirus in northern\nGreece, after providing\nhelp to Thurii in its dispute\nMap 6.5 | Roman Territories at the End of the Second Punic War |\nwith Tarentum.

The Romans finally defeated Pyrrhus at their third\nbattle against him in 275 BCE, showing the superiority of the new Roman manipular legion even\nagainst the phalanx of the Macedonians, military descendants of Alexander the Great himself.\nThis victory united most of Italy, except for the very northern portion, under Roman rule.\nThe war with Pyrrhus was the Romans\u2019 first serious conflict with the Greek world, but it was far\nfrom their last. The Romans\u2019 proximity to northern Greece, in particular, ensured an intersection\nof spheres of interest, thus also providing cause for continued conflict. Between 214 and 148 BCE,\nRome fought four separate Macedonian Wars. During roughly the same period, from 264 and 146\nBCE, the Romans also fought three Punic Wars against Carthage, originally a Phoenician colony\nthat became a leading maritime power. Culminating with the Roman destruction of both Carthage\nPage | 235 and Corinth in 146 BCE, the eventual victory of the Romans over both powers allowed the Romans\nto gain full control over them and their previous land holdings. Their victory effectively put the\nentire Mediterranean world under Roman rule.\nIn 146 BCE, when the Romans found themselves in control of a Mediterranean empire, they\nappeared to foresee little of the consequences of such a rapid expansion on internal stability in\nRome proper. A critical question nevertheless faced them: how would the Republic, whose system\nof government was designed for a small city-state, adapt to ruling a large empire? The preliminary\nanswer on which the Romans settled was to divide the conquered territories into provinces, to\nwhich senatorial governors were assigned for terms that varied from one to five years. The system\ncontinued, with minor variations, into the Empire.\nMap 6.6 | Roman Provinces in the Late First Century BCE and Early First Century CE\nAuthor: User \u201cCristino64\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nThe new availability of governor positions, however, only made the political competition in the\nRepublic even stiffer than before. Senators competed for the most desirable positions; typically,\nthese were provinces in which military action was on-going\u2014since this provided the potential\nPage | 236 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nfor winning military glory\u2014or provinces that were wealthy, with the potential opportunity in\ngoverning them to acquire wealth.\n6.9 FALL OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC\nThe victory over Carthage in the Second Punic War allowed Rome to \u201cclose\u201d the circle of\nthe Mediterranean almost completely, acquiring control over all territories that had previously\nbelonged to Carthage. The destruction of Carthage in the Third Punic War, while largely a symbolic\ngesture, further cemented Rome\u2019s control over the entire Mediterranean. The late Republican\nhistorian Sallust, though, grimly saw the Roman victory in the Punic Wars as the beginning of\nthe end of the Republic. As Sallust and some other conservative politicians of his day believed,\nthis victory corrupted the noble Roman character, traditionally steeled by privation. More im-\nportantly, the abundance of resources that flowed in following the victories over Carthage raised\nthe question of distribution of this new wealth and land. The disagreements over this question\ndominated the politics of the Late Republic, creating two new political factions: the Populares,\nor those who protected the interests of the people, and the Optimates, or those who protected\nthe interests of the best element of the populace\u2014namely, themselves.\n6.9.1 The Gracchi and the Beginning of Political Violence\nIt is striking to consider that political violence was minimal in the Roman Republic until 133\nBCE. Indeed, if the legends are true, even the expulsion of the kings in 510 BCE was a bloodless\nevent. Starting with 133 BCE, however, the final century of the Roman Republic was defined by\npolitical violence and civil wars.\nIn 133 BCE, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, a scion on his mother\u2019s side of one of the\noldest and most respected families in Rome, the Cornelii Scipiones, was one of the ten annually\nelected plebeian tribunes. Alarmed that the lands acquired through recent Roman conquests\nhad largely been taken over by rich landowners at the expense of poorer Romans, Gracchus\nproposed a land distribution law, known as the Lex Sempronia Agraria. Gracchus argued that\nthe advantages of such land redistribution would have benefited the state, since land-ownership\nwas a pre-requisite for military service. Aware that the Senate\u2019s Optimates faction opposed his\nproposal, Gracchus took his law directly to the Plebeian Council, which passed it. This measure\nresulted in escalating conflict between Gracchus and the rest of the Senate. At a meeting of the\nSenate, the pontifex maximus, who was Tiberius Gracchus\u2019 own cousin Publius Cornelius Scipio\nNasica, ultimately argued that Gracchus had attempted to make himself king; thus, he had to\nbe stopped. Since weapons were banned inside the Senate building, enraged Senators grabbed\nwhatever was on hand, including chair and table legs, and clubbed Gracchus to death. As the\nbiographer Plutarch states, this was the first instance of civic strife of this kind in ancient Rome.\nThe death of Tiberius Gracchus also meant the death of his proposed law. Ten years later,\nhowever, Gracchus\u2019 proposed reforms gained a second life in the hands of his younger brother,\nGaius Gracchus, who was elected plebeian tribune in 123 BCE and served a second term in that\nPage | 237 office in 122 BCE. Gaius Gracchus\u2019 revived agrarian reform proposal was even more ambitious than\nhis brother\u2019s a decade earlier. Especially controversial was Gaius Gracchus\u2019 proposal of granting\nfull Roman citizenship to Rome\u2019s Italian allies. Finally, in 121 BCE, alarmed at Gaius Gracchus\u2019\npopularity with the people, the consul Lucius Opimius proposed a new measure in the Senate: a\nsenatus consultum ultimum, or the final decree of the Senate, which amounted to allowing the\nconsuls to do whatever was necessary to safeguard the state. Realizing that the passing of this law\namounted to his death sentence, Gaius Gracchus committed suicide.\nThe proposed reforms of Gaius Gracchus were overturned after his death, but the legacy of\nthe Gracchi for the remainder of the history of the Roman Republic cannot be underestimat-\ned. First, their proposed laws showed the growing conflict between the rich and the poor in the\nRoman state. Second, the willingness on the part of prominent Senators to resort to violence to\nresolve matters set a dangerous precedent for the remainder of the Republic and fundamentally\nchanged the nature of Roman politics. Finally, the support that the Gracchi received from the\nRoman people, as well as the residents of Italian cities who were not full citizens, showed that the\ncauses that the Gracchi adopted were not going to go away permanently after their death. Indeed,\nRome\u2019s Italian allies went to war against Rome in 90 \u2013 88 BCE; the result of this Social War,\nafter \u201csocii,\u201d meaning \u201callies,\u201d was the grant of full Roman citizenship rights to Italians.\n6.9.2 The Civil War of Marius and Sulla, and the Conspiracy of Catilina\nThe affair of the Gracchi was the first clear instance in\nthe late Republic of Populares and Optimates in a violent\nconflict. Forty years later, a conflict between two politi-\ncians, representing different sides in this debate, resulted\nin a full-fledged civil war.\nIn 107 BCE, impatient over the prolonged and challeng-\ning war against the Numidian king Jugurtha, the Romans\nelected as consul Gaius Marius.\nWhile Marius had already enjoyed a distinguished\nmilitary career, he was a novus homo, or \u201cnew man,\u201d a term\nthe Romans used to refer to newcomers to Roman politics,\nmeaning individuals who have not had any family members\nelected to political office. Even more shockingly, Marius was\nnot even from Rome proper, but from the town of Arpinum,\nlocated sixty miles south of Rome. Marius benefited from\nthe sense of frustration in Rome over the length of the war\nand the perceived corruption of the aristocratic leaders\nabroad. Once elected, he took over the command in the war\nand passed the most comprehensive reforms to the Roman\nFigure 6.8 | Bust of Gaius Marius\nmilitary since the Romans switched to the manipular legion.

A second and\nrelated change was the new com-\nmitment on the part of the Roman\nstate to arm its troops and also\npay them for service. Henceforth,\nthe military became a profession,\nrather than a seasonal occupa-\ntion for farmers. Finally, Marius\nchanged the tactics of the legionary\norganization on the battlefield,\nchanging the legion of maniples\ninto a legion of cohorts.\nMarius\u2019 reforms, while con- Figure 6.9 | Roman Soldiers with Aquilifer Signifer Centurio |\ntroversial, proved immensely suc- The Cohortal Legion after Marius.

As a result of his victories, License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nMarius had gained unprecedented popularity in Rome and\nwas elected to five more successive consulships in 104 \u2013 100\nBCE. While a law existed requiring ten years between succes-\nsive consulships, Marius\u2019 popularity and military success, in\nconjunction with the Romans\u2019 fear of on-going foreign wars,\nelevated him above the law. While Marius began his military\ncareer fighting for Rome, though, he ended it by causing the\nworst civil war Rome had seen to that point.\nIn 88 BCE, the Roman Senate was facing a war against\nMithridates, king of Pontus, who had long been a thorn in\nRome\u2019s side in the Eastern provinces of the empire. Sensing\nthat Marius was too old to undertake the war, the Senate\nappointed instead Lucius Cornelius Sulla, a distinguished\ngeneral who had started his career as Marius\u2019 quaestor in\nthe Jugurthine War and was now a consul himself. Marius,\nhowever, had another trick up his sleeve. Summoning the\nPlebeian Council, Marius overturned the decision of the\nFigure 6.10 | Bust of Lucius Senate and drove Sulla out of Rome. Instead of going lightly\nCornelius Sulla into exile, however, Sulla gathered an army and marched\nAuthor: User \u201cDirektor\u201d\non Rome\u2014the first time in Roman history that a Roman\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain general led a Roman army against Rome!\nPage | 239 Sulla took over Rome, swiftly had himself declared commander of the war on Mithridates, and\ndeparted for the Black Sea. In 86 BCE, Marius was elected consul for the seventh and final time in\nhis career then promptly died of natural causes, just seventeen days after taking office. The civil\nwar that he started with Sulla, though, was still far from over.\nIn 83 BCE, victorious over Mithridates but facing a hostile reception from the Senate, Sulla\nmarched on Rome for the second time. This time, he truly meant business. Declaring himself\ndictator for reforming the Roman constitution, Sulla ruled Rome as a dictator for the next three\nyears. His reforms aimed to prevent the rise of another Marius so significantly curtailed the\npowers of the plebeian tribunes. In addition, he established the proscriptions\u2014a list of enemies\nof the state, whom anyone could kill on sight, and whose property was confiscated. Incidentally,\none name on Sulla\u2019s list was the young Julius Caesar, whose aunt had been married to Gaius\nMarius. While Caesar obviously survived the proscription, and went on to become a prominent\npolitician himself, the confiscation of his property by Sulla ensured that he remained painfully\nstrapped financially and in debt for the rest of his life.\nAfter enacting his reforms, Sulla just as suddenly resigned from politics, retiring to a family\nestate outside of Rome in 79 BCE, where he appears to have drunk himself into an early grave\u2014\nbased on Plutarch\u2019s description of his death, the symptoms appear to fit with cirrhosis of the liver.\nOver the next several decades, some of Sulla\u2019s reforms were overturned, such as those pertaining\nto the plebeian tribunes. Most historians of the Republic agree, however, that the Republican\nconstitution never afterward reverted to its old state. The Republic after Sulla was a different\nRepublic than before him.\nThe civil war of Marius and Sulla showed the increasingly greater degree of competition in the\nRepublic as well as the lengths to which some Roman politicians were willing to go to get power\nand hold on to it. Furthermore, it demonstrated one dangerous side effect of Marius\u2019 military\nreforms: before Marius, Roman farmer-soldiers did not feel a personal affinity for their generals.\nAfter Marius\u2019 reforms, however, because soldiers were paid by their generals, their loyalty was\nto their generals, as much or more than to the Roman state. Finally, Marius\u2019 incredible political\nsuccess\u2014election to a record-setting and law-breaking seven consulships over the course of his\nlife\u2014showed that military ability had somewhat leveled the playing field between old patrician\nfamilies such as Sulla\u2019s\u2014that had dominated the consulship for centuries\u2014and the newcomers\nto Roman politics. This challenge by the newcomers to the old Roman political families was an\nespecially bitter pill to swallow for some.\nIn 63 BCE, Lucius Sergius Catilina, a patrician who had unsuccessfully run for consulship\nand who was defeated that very year by another newcomer from Arpinum, Marcus Tullius Cicero,\nbanded with other frustrated Senators to plan a conspiracy to assassinate the consuls and take over\nthe state. Catilina\u2019s conspiracy failed, and modern historians can read Cicero\u2019s own reports to the\nSenate and the people about how he discovered and stopped this conspiracy. Catilina\u2019s frustration,\njust like that of Sulla twenty years earlier, nevertheless shows how difficult it was for Roman \u201cold-\nschool\u201d political families to accept that their competition for the consulship now was not just against\neach other. Catilina\u2019s plan to resort to violence to achieve power also shows just how quickly political\nviolence became the \u201cnormal\u201d solution to problems in Roman Republican politics after the Gracchi.\nPage | 240 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\n6.9.3 The First Triumvirate, and the Civil War of Caesar and Pompey\nThe political careers of Marius and Sulla, as well as Catilina,\nshow the increased level of competition in the late Republic and\nthe ruthlessness with which some Roman politicians in the period\nattempted to gain the consulship. In 60 BCE, however, a group\nof three politicians tried to achieve its goals by doing something\natypical of Roman politicians who had largely only looked out for\nthemselves: the three formed an alliance in order to help each\nother. Spectacularly, their alliance even transcended the usual\ndivision of Populares and Optimates, showing that, for these three\nmen at least, the thirst for political power was more important\nthan any other personal convictions.\nMarcus Licinius Crassus was the wealthiest man in Rome,\nson of a consul, and consul himself in 70 BCE. His colleague in\nthe consulship in 70 BCE, Gnaeus Pompey, achieved military\nfame in his youth, earning him the nickname \u201cMagnus,\u201d or \u201cthe Figure 6.11 | Bust of Pompey\nGreat,\u201d from Sulla himself. the Great | Pompey the Great with\nAlexander the Great\u2019s Hairstyle\nBy 60 BCE, however, both Crassus and Pompey felt frus-\nAuthor: User \u201cRobbot\u201d\ntrated with their political careers so joined forces with a relative Source: Wikimedia Commons\nnewcomer to the world of politics, Gaius Julius Caesar. The License: Public Domain\nthree men formed their alliance, secret at first, an alliance which\nCicero later dubbed the Triumvirate. To cement the alliance, Caesar\u2019s daughter, Julia, married\nPompey. Together, they lobbied to help each other rise again to the consulship and achieve\ndesirable military commands.\nThe alliance paid immediate dividends for Caesar, who was promptly elected consul for 59\nBCE and was then awarded Gaul as his province for five years after the consulship. Crassus and\nPompey, in the meanwhile, were re-elected consuls for 55 BCE, and, in the same year, Caesar\u2019s\ncommand in Gaul was renewed for another five years. One modern historian has called it \u201cthe\nworst piece of legislation in Roman history,\u201d since the renewal did not specify whether the five-year\nclock started afresh in 55 BCE\u2014in which case, Caesar\u2019s command was to end in 50 BCE\u2014or if the\nfive years were added to the original five-year term\u2014in which case, Caesar\u2019s command would have\nended in 48 BCE.\nA talented writer, as well as skilled general, Caesar made sure to publish an account of his\nGallic campaigns in installments during his time in Gaul. As a result, Romans were continually\naware of Caesar\u2019s successes, and his popularity actually grew in his absence. His rising popularity\nwas a source of frustration for the other two triumvirs. Finally, the already uneasy alliance disin-\ntegrated in 53 BCE. First, Julia died in childbirth, and her baby died with her. In the same year,\nCrassus was killed at the Battle of Carrhae, fighting the Parthians. With the death of both Julia\nand Crassus, no links were left connecting Caesar and Pompey; the two former family relations,\nalbeit by marriage, swiftly became official enemies.\nPage | 241 Late in 50 BCE, the Senate, under the leadership of\nPompey, informed Caesar that his command had expired\nand demanded that he surrender his army. Caesar,\nhowever, refused to return to Rome as a private citizen,\ndemanding to be allowed to stand for the consulship in\nabsentia. When his demands were refused, on January\n10th of 49 BCE, Caesar and his army crossed the Rubicon, a\nriver which marked the border of his province. By leaving\nhis province with his army against the wishes of the Senate,\nCaesar committed an act of treason, as defined in Roman\nlaw; the civil war began.\nWhile most of the Senate was on Pompey\u2019s side, Caesar\nstarted the war with a distinct advantage: his troops had just\nspent a larger part of a decade fighting with him in Gaul;\nmany of Pompey\u2019s army, on the other hand, was disorga-\nnized. As a result, for much of 49 BCE, Pompey retreated to Figure 6.12 | Bust of Cleopatra VII\nAuthor: User \u201cLouis le Grand\u201d\nthe south of Italy, with Caesar in pursuit.

When he arrived in Egypt in\npursuit of Pompey, Caesar, however, sided with Ptolemy\u2019s sister Cleopatra VII and appears to\nhave fathered a son with her, Caesarion.\nWith Pompey\u2019s death, the civil war was largely over, although Caesar still fought a number of\nbattles across the Roman world with the remnants of the senatorial army. It is indeed striking to\nlook at a map of Caesar\u2019s military career. While his military actions on behalf of Rome were largely\nlimited to Gaul, with a couple of forays into Britain, his civil war against Pompey and his allies\ntook Caesar all over the Roman world from 49 to 45 BCE.\n6.9.4 Aftermath of the Civil War, the Second Triumvirate, and the Age\nof Augustus\nVictorious in the civil war against Pompey and his supporters, Caesar was faced with the chal-\nlenging question of what to do next. Clearly, he was planning to hold on to power in some way.\nBased on previous history, there were two options available to him: the Marius model of rule,\nmeaning election to successive consulships, and the Sulla model, meaning dictatorship. Initially,\nCaesar followed the first model, holding the consulship first with a colleague in 47 BCE and 46 BCE\nthen serving as sole consul in 45 BCE. By early 44 BCE, however, Caesar appears to have decided to\nadopt the Sulla model instead. In February of 44\nBCE, he took the title of dictator perpetuo, or\n\u201cdictator for life,\u201d and had coins minted with his\nimage and new title. His was the first instance\nin Roman history of a living individual\u2019s placing\nhis likeness on coinage.\nThis new title appears to have been the final\nstraw for a group of about sixty senators who\nfeared that Caesar aimed to make himself a\nking. On the Ides of March (March 15th) of 44\nFigure 6.13 | Coin of Caesar from 44 BCE | Note BCE, the conspirators rushed Caesar during a\nCaesar\u2019s Image on One Side, and Venus on the reverse.\nSenate meeting and stabbed him to death. But\nAuthor: User \u201cMedium69\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons if the conspirators had thought that by assas-\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 sinating Caesar they were going to restore the\nRepublic, they turned out to be sorely mistaken.\nCaesar\u2019s will, in which he left money to each resident of the city of Rome and donated his\ngardens for use by the public, only further increased his popularity among the people, and popular\nrioting ensued throughout the city. Since Caesar did not have legitimate sons who could inherit\u2014\nCaesarion, his son with Cleopatra, was illegitimate\u2014he adopted an heir in his will, a common\nRoman practice. The heir in question was his grand-nephew Gaius Octavius, whose name after\nthe adoption became Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (or Octavian, in English). It is interesting to\nnote that Caesar\u2019s will also named a back-up heir, in case the main heir would have died before\ninheriting. The back-up heir was none other than Brutus, one of Caesar\u2019s assassins.\nPage | 243 At the time of his adoption as Caesar\u2019s heir,\nOctavian was nineteen years old; thus, he was\ntoo young to have had much military or political\nexperience. Quickly, though, he showed political\nacumen, initially using an alliance with two much\nmore experienced former allies of Caesar: Marcus\nAntonius and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Forming\nwhat became known as the Second Triumvirate,\nthe three men renewed the proscriptions in 43 BCE,\naggressively pursuing the enemies of Caesar and also\nfighting a small-scale civil war with Caesar\u2019s assassins.\nThe triumvirs defeated Caesar\u2019s assassins at the\nBattle of Philippi in northern Greece in 42 BCE; they\nthen carved out the Roman world into regions to be\nruled by each. Marcus Antonius, who claimed Egypt,\nalthough it was not yet a Roman province, proceeded\nto marry Cleopatra and rule Egypt with her over the\nfollowing decade. Ultimately, however, another civil\nwar resulted between Antonius and Octavian, with\nFigure 6.14 | Statue of Augustus from the the latter winning a decisive victory in the Battle of\nVilla of Livia at Prima Porta Actium in 31 BCE. From that moment until his death\nAuthor: User \u201cSoerfm\u201d\nin 14 CE, Octavian\u2014soon to be named Augustus in\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 27 BCE, the name he subsequently used\u2014ruled what\nhenceforth was known as the Roman Empire, and is\nconsidered by modern historians of Rome to have been the first emperor.\nWhile modern historians refer to Augustus as the first emperor of Rome, that is not the title\nthat he himself had, nor would he have said that he was inaugurating a new form of govern-\nment in Rome. Rather, throughout his time in power, Augustus claimed to have restored the\nRoman Republic, and, with the exception of a few elected offices, he did not have any official\nposition. How did he manage to rule the Roman Empire for over forty years without any official\nposition? Some answers can be found in the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, an autobiography that\nAugustus himself composed in the year before he died and which he ordered to be posted on his\nMausoleum in Rome, with copies also posted in all major cities throughout the Empire.\nReflecting on his forty-year rule in this document, Augustus described himself as the first\ncitizen, or princeps, of the Roman state, superior to others in his auctoritas. In addition, he\nwas especially proud of the title of \u201cPater Patriae,\u201d or \u201cFather of the Fatherland,\u201d voted to him\nby the Senate and reflecting his status as the patron of all citizens. It is striking to consider that\nother than these honorary titles and positions, Augustus did not have an official position as a\nruler. Indeed, having learned from Caesar\u2019s example, he avoided accepting any titles that might\nhave smacked of a desire for kingship. Instead, he brilliantly created for himself new titles and\npowers, thoroughly grounded in previous, Republican tradition. In addition, he proved to be\nPage | 244 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\na master diplomat, who shared\npower with the Senate in a way\nbeneficial to himself, and by all of\nthese actions seamlessly married\nthe entire Republican political\nstructure with one-man rule.\nThe question remains: when\ndid the Roman Republic actually\nfall? Different historians have\nproposed several possible answers.\nOne minority position is that the\nRepublic had fallen with the dic-\ntatorship of Sulla, since it funda-\nmentally altered the nature of the\nRepublican government and per-\nmanently destabilized it. Another\npossible answer is the assassination\nof Caesar in 44 BCE, since after-\nwards, the Republic was never quite\nthe same as it had been before the\ncivil war of Pompey and Caesar. Figure 6.15 | Copy of the Res Gestae in Modern Ankara, Turkey\nAnother possible answer is 27 BCE, Author: User \u201cSoerfm\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nwhen the Senate granted Octavian\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nthe title of Augustus, recognizing\nhis albeit unofficial consolidation of\npower. Finally, yet another possible answer is the death of Augustus in 14 CE. Overall, all of these\npossible dates and events show the instability of the Roman state in the late first century BCE.\n6.9.5 Roman Culture of the Late Republic and the Augustan Age\nWhile the political structure of the Roman Republic in its final century of existence was\nbecoming increasingly unstable, the period from the end of the Second Punic War on was actually\none of increasing flourishing of entertainment culture and literary arts in Rome. Although much\nof Roman literary culture was based on Greek literature, the Romans adapted what they borrowed\nto make it distinctly their own. Thus, while adapting Greek tragedies and comedies and, in some\ncases, apparently translating them wholesale, Romans still injected Roman values into them, thus\nmaking them relatable to Roman Republican audiences. For example, in one fragment from a\nRoman tragedy, Iphigenia at Aulis, adapted by the Roman poet Ennius from the Greek tragedian\nEuripides\u2019 play by the same name, the chorus of frustrated Greek soldiers debates the merits\nof otium, or leisure, and negotium, or business (a specifically Roman concept). Similarly, while\nRoman philosophy and rhetoric of the Republic were heavily based on their Greek counterparts,\nPage | 245 their writers thoroughly Romanized the concepts discussed, as well as the presentation. For\ninstance, Cicero, a preeminent rhetorician and philosopher of the late Republic, adapted the\nmodel of the Socratic dialogue in several of his philosophical treatises to make dialogues between\nprominent Romans of the Middle Republic. His De Republica, a work expressly modeled on\nPlato\u2019s Republic, features Scipio Aemilianus, the victor over Carthage in the Third Punic War.\nWhile the late Republic was a period of growth for Roman literary arts, with much of the\nwriting done by politicians, the age of Augustus saw an even greater flourishing of Roman liter-\nature. This increase was due in large part to Augustus\u2019 own investment in sponsoring prominent\npoets to write about the greatness of Rome. The three most prominent poets of the Augustan age,\nVirgil, Horace, and Ovid, all wrote poetry glorifying Augustan Rome. Virgil\u2019s Aeneid, finished in\n19 BCE, aimed to be the Roman national epic and indeed achieved that goal. The epic, intended\nto be the Roman version of Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey combined, told about the travels of the\nTrojan prince Aeneas who, by will of the gods, became the founder of Rome. Clearly connecting\nthe Roman to the Greek heroic tradition, the epic also includes a myth explaining the origins\nof the Punic Wars: during his travels, before he arrived in Italy, Aeneas was ship-wrecked and\nlanded in Carthage. Dido, the queen of Carthage, fell in love with him and wanted him to stay with\nher, but the gods ordered Aeneas to sail on to Italy. After Aeneas abandoned her, Dido committed\nsuicide and cursed the future Romans to be at war with her people.\nThe works of Horace and Ovid were more humorous at times, but they still included signifi-\ncant elements from early Roman myths. They thus served to showcase the pax deorum that caused\nRome to flourish in the past and, again now, in the age of Augustus. Ovid appears to have pushed\nthe envelope beyond acceptable\nlimits, whether in his poetry\nor in his personal conduct.\nTherefore, Augustus exiled him\nin 8 CE to the city of Tomis on\nthe Black Sea, where Ovid spent\nthe remainder of his life writing\nmournful poetry and begging\nunsuccessfully to be recalled\nback to Rome.\nIn addition to sponsoring lit-\nerature, the age of Augustus was\na time of building and rebuild-\ning around Rome. In his Res\nGestae, Augustus includes a very\nlong list of temples that he had\nrestored or built. Among some\nnew building projects that he Figure 6.16 | The Ara Pacis\nAuthor: User \u201cManfred Heyde\u201d\nundertook to stand as symbols of\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nrenewal and prosperity ordained License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 246 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nby the gods themselves, none is as famous as the Ara Pacis, or Altar of Peace, in Rome. The altar\nfeatures a number of mythological scenes and processions of gods; it also integrates scenes of the\nimperial family, including Augustus himself making a sacrifice to the gods, while flanked by his\ngrandsons Gaius and Lucius.\nThe message of these building projects, as well as the other arts that Augustus sponsored is,\noverall, simple: Augustus wanted to show that his rule was a new Golden Age of Roman history, a\ntime when peace was restored and Rome flourished, truly blessed by the gods.\n6.10 THE EARLY EMPIRE\nThe period from the consolidation of power by Augustus in 27 BCE to the death of the emperor\nMarcus Aurelius in 180 CE was one of relative peace and prosperity throughout the Roman\nEmpire. For this reason, the Romans themselves referred to this time as the Pax Romana, or\nRoman peace. During this period, the Empire became increasingly more of a smoothly run bu-\nreaucratic machine when commerce prospered, and the overall territory grew to its largest extent\nin the early second century CE. Of course, some of the Roman subjects did not feel quite as happy\nwith this peace and what it brought to them. The Roman historian Tacitus narrates a speech of\na British tribal rebel leader, Calgacus, to his men before they fought\u2014and were defeated by\u2014the\nRomans in 85 CE: \u201cthey (the Romans) make a desert, and call it peace.\u201d Other evidence from\nthe territories in the periphery of the Empire also shows that Romanization was not absolute, as\nsome remote rural areas in provinces far from Italy did not really feel the impact of the Empire.\nFinally, the period of the early Empire witnessed the rise of a new religion, Christianity. This\nnew religion did not have a profound impact on the state yet at this point, but the seeds planted\nin this period allowed for fundamental changes to occur centuries later. This is, after all, one of\nthe marvels of history. It can take centuries to see the long-term impact of events that seem so\nsmall and insignificant at first.\n6.10.1 The Julio-Claudian Dynasty\nThe historian Tacitus describes in detail the emotions in the Roman Senate upon the death of\nAugustus. Some Senators were hoping for the return of the Republic, while others assumed that\nAugustus\u2019 stepson would inherit his nebulous yet amazingly powerful position. The scales were\nheavily weighed in favor of the latter option: as Tacitus points out, most Senators by 14 CE\u2014fifty\nyears after Caesar\u2019s assassination\u2014had never lived under a Republic; thus, they did not really\nknow what a true Republic looked like. Still, the question that all were pondering in 14 CE was:\nhow do you pass on something that does not exist? After all, Augustus did not have any official\nposition. The first succession was a test case to see if the imperial system of government would\nbecome the new normal for Rome or if Augustus would prove to have been an exception.\nAugustus himself seems to have been worried about appointing a successor for his entire\ntime in power. Because of untimely deaths of all other possible candidates, Augustus eventually\nsettled on adopting his stepson Tiberius Claudius Nero (not to be confused with the later\nPage | 247 emperor Nero), son of his wife Livia from her first\nmarriage. Over the final years of his life, Augustus\ngradually shared more of his unofficial powers with\nTiberius, in order to smooth the process of succes-\nsion. Augustus\u2019 plan appears to have worked, as after\na brief conversation in the Senate, as Tacitus reports,\nthe Senators conferred upon Tiberius all of Augustus\u2019\nprevious powers. Tiberius\u2019 succession is the reason\nfor which historians refer to the first Roman imperial\ndynasty as the Julio-Claudians.\nTiberius, a decorated military general in his\nyouth, appears in our sources as a sullen and possibly\ncruel individual, whose temperament made Augustus\nhimself feel sorry for the Romans for leaving such a\nruler in his stead\u2014or so Suetonius tells us.\nHe also appears to have been a rather reluctant\nemperor, who much preferred life out of the public\neye. Finally, in 26 CE, Tiberius retired to Capri for Figure 6.17 | Bust of the Emperor Tiberius\nthe final eleven years of his rule. It is a testament Author: User \u201cManfred Heyde\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nto the spectacular bureaucratic system that was the\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nRoman Empire that the eleven-year absence of the\nemperor was hardly felt, one exception being a foiled\nplot against Tiberius by his chief trusted advisor in\nRome, Sejanus.\nSimilarly to Augustus, Tiberius had a difficult\ntime selecting a successor, as repeatedly, each\nrelative who was identified as a candidate died an\nuntimely death. Ultimately, Tiberius adopted as his\nsuccessor his grandnephew Gaius Caligula, or \u201clittle\nboot,\u201d son of the popular military hero Germanicus,\nwho died young.\nWhile Caligula began his power with full support\nof both the people and the Senate, and with an un-\nprecedented degree of popularity, he swiftly proved\nto be mentally unstable and bankrupted the state\nin his short rule of just under four years. In 41 CE,\nhe was assassinated by three disgruntled officers in\nthe Praetorian Guard, which ironically was the body\nformed by Augustus in order to protect the emperor. Figure 6.18 | Bust of the Emperor Caligula\nAuthor: User \u201cManfred Heyde\u201d\nCaligula\u2019s assassination left Rome in disarray.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nThe biographer Suetonius reports that, while the License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 248 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nconfused Senate was meeting and planning to declare\nthe restoration of the Roman Republic, the Praetorian\nGuard proclaimed as the next emperor Claudius,\nuncle of Caligula and the brother of Germanicus.\nWhile Claudius was a member of the imperial\nfamily, he was never considered a candidate for succes-\nsion before. He had a speech impediment; as a result,\nAugustus considered him an embarrassment to the\nimperial family. Claudius proved to be a productive\nemperor, but his downfall appears to have been pretty\nwomen of bad character, as he repeatedly weathered\nplots against his life by first one wife and then the\nnext. Finally, in 54 CE, Claudius died and was widely\nbelieved to have been poisoned by his wife, Agrippina\nthe Younger. Since the cause, as Suetonius tells us, was\nmushrooms, a popular joke thereafter in Rome was that\nmushrooms were the food of the gods\u2014a reference to\nFigure 6.19 | Bust of the Emperor Claudius the deification of most emperors after their death.\nAuthor: User \u201cDirektor\u201d Although Claudius had a biological son from an\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nearlier marriage, that son was poisoned soon after his\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.5\ndeath. His successor instead became Nero, his stepson,\nwho was only sixteen years old when he gained power.\nShowing the danger of inexperience for an emperor,\nNero gradually alienated the Senate, the people, and\nthe army over the course of his fourteen-year rule.\nHe destroyed his own reputation by performing on\nstage\u2014behavior that was considered disgraceful in\nRoman society. Furthermore, Nero is believed in 64\nCE to have caused the great fire of Rome in order to\nfree up space in the middle of the city for his ambitious\nnew palace, the Domus Aurea, or Golden House.\nThe last years of Nero\u2019s reign seem to have been\ncharacterized by provincial rebellions, as a revolt\nbroke out in Judea in 66 CE, and then the governor of\nGaul, Gaius Julius Vindex, also rebelled against Nero.\nThe revolt of Vindex ultimately proved to be the end of\nNero, since Vindex convinced the governor of Spain,\nFigure 6.20 | Sketch of an Ancient Servius Sulpicius Galba, to join the rebellion and,\nGraffito of the Emperor Nero furthermore, proclaim himself emperor. While the\nAuthor: User \u201cShakko\u201d\nrebellion of Vindex was quickly squashed, and Vindex\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain himself committed suicide, popular support for Galba\nPage | 249 grew just as quickly. Finally, terrified by rumors of Galba marching to Rome, Nero committed\nsuicide in June of 68 CE. His death marked the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n6.10.2 The Year of the Four Emperors, the Flavian Dynasty, and the\nFive Good Emperors\nThe year and a half after Nero\u2019s death saw more civil war and instability throughout the empire\nthan any other period since the late Republic. In particular, the year 69 CE became known as the\nyear of the four emperors, as four emperors in succession came to power: Galba, Otho, Vitellius,\nand Vespasian. Each challenged his predecessor to a civil war, and each was as swiftly defeated by\nthe next challenger.\nIn the process, as the historian Tacitus later noted, the year of the four emperors revealed\ntwo key secrets that continued to be a factor in subsequent history of the Empire. First, emperors\nMap 6.8 | Map of the Roman Empire 68-69 CE | Year of the Four Emperors\nAuthor: User \u201cFulvio314\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 250 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\ncould now be made outside of Rome, as seen, for\nexample, with Galba\u2019s proclamation as emperor\nin Spain. Second, the army could make emperors;\nindeed, each of the four emperors in 69 CE was\nproclaimed emperor by his troops. These two\narcana imperii, or \u201csecrets of empire,\u201d as Tacitus\ndubbed them, continued to play a strong role in\nsubsequent history of the Roman Empire. Their\nunveiling showed the declining importance of\nRome as the center of political power and the con-\ncomitant decline in the importance of the Senate,\nonce an advisory body to the entire empire, but\nnow increasingly confined in its authority to Rome\nproper alone. Figure 6.21 | Arch of Titus | Arch of Titus,\nSeveral reasons caused Vespasian, a mere son celebrating his victory over Judaea, and featuring\nimages of war spoils on the inside.\nof a tax-collector, to be the only successful emperor\nAuthor: User \u201cJebulon\u201d\nof 69 CE and the founder of the Flavian dynasty.

Ironically, Nero had originally appointed him to\ncommand the Jewish War because of Vespasian\u2019s humble family origins\u2014which to Nero meant\nthat he was not a political threat. Second, Vespasian was the only one of the four emperors of 69\nCE who had grown sons, and thus obvious successors. Furthermore, his older son, Titus, was\nalready a popular military commander in his own right and cemented his reputation even further\nby his conquest of Jerusalem in 70 CE.\nThe Flavian dynasty did not last long, however, as it ended in 96 CE with the assassination of\nEmperor Domitian, Vespasian\u2019s younger son. The period from 96 CE to 180 CE saw a different\nexperiment in determining imperial succession, instead of establishing traditional dynasties in\nwhich sons succeeded their fathers. Known as the period of the \u201cFive Good Emperors,\u201d the\ntrend in the second century CE was for each emperor to adopt a talented leader with potential\nas his successor. The result was what Edward Gibbon, the nineteenth-century British historian\nof Rome, called \u201cthe happiest age\u201d of mankind. But was life everywhere in the Roman Empire in\nthe second century equally happy for all? The evidence suggests that while Rome and other major\nurban centers flourished, life in the periphery could be a very different experience.\n6.10.3 Center Versus Periphery in the Roman Empire: the Evidence of\nPliny and Apuleius\nMuch of extant evidence from the Roman Empire comes from Rome and Italy. As is so often\nthe case with empires, though, life in Rome was not representative of everyday life in the empire.\nThe problems with which residents of Rome had to contend were a far cry from those with which\nresidents of distant provinces had to deal. Careful examination of two sources from the second\ncentury CE reveals that the relationship of the Roman Empire to the provinces in the periphery\nwas often uneasy. Writing about two different provinces within a half-century of each other,\nthe two sources, Pliny the Younger and Apuleius, show the complicated blessings of living in a\nprovince far away from Rome that was yet under Roman rule.\nIt is shocking to consider today that most Roman governors setting out for the job received just\none type of personnel to assist them with their duties: a flute-player, whose job was to play during\nsacrifice ceremonies. Since military forces were expensive to maintain and needed for emergen-\ncies in those areas of the Empire considered to be the most at risk for rebellion or outside attack,\nmost governors did not have a legion stationed in their province. So how did governors resolve\nproblems, and what resources did they find when they arrived? The single best sources of informa-\ntion about Roman provincial government is the prolific letter-writer Pliny the Younger, who served\nas governor of the province of Bithynia on the shore of the Black Sea in 111 \u2013 113 CE. Pliny was a\ncautious and conscientious governor, and thus believed in consulting the emperor Trajan on every\nsingle issue that he encountered in his province. Luckily for us, their correspondence survives.\nPliny\u2019s letters reveal a myriad of problems that the governor was expected to solve: staffing\npersonnel for prisons (is it acceptable to use slaves as prison guards?), building repairs and water\nsupply, abandoned infants and their legal status (should they be considered slave-born or free?),\nPage | 252 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nfire brigades (are they a potential security risk to the Empire?) and, most famously, what to do with\nChristians in the province. The emperor Trajan patiently responded to each letter that he received\nfrom Pliny and appears to have placed stability and peace in the province foremost in his concerns.\nThus, for instance, with regard to the issue of Christians in Bithynia, Trajan recommends that Pliny\nnot worry about tracking down Christians in his province, as they were not a threat.\nAnother perspective from the periphery comes from the novel Metamorphoses or Golden\nAss, written by the North African intellectual Apuleius sometime in the later part of the second\ncentury CE. The protagonist of the novel, Lucius, is a curious intellectual who is traveling through\nGreece and, through a magic experiment gone wrong, accidentally is turned into a donkey. For\nthe remainder of the novel, Lucius, in his donkey form, is repeatedly stolen, traded, beaten, and\nabused, until finally being rescued at the end of the novel by the Egyptian goddess Isis, whose\nservice he then enters as a priest. Throughout his travels, though, Lucius\u2019 observations reveal the\nlimits of Romanization in the remote parts of Greece. Law and order are largely absent, highway\nrobbery is simply a normal part of life, and on the one occasion when a poor farmer runs into\na Roman soldier on the road, the soldier forcibly requisitions the farmer\u2019s sole possession: his\ndonkey. Overall, the picture that Apuleius paints reveals the dark side of the Pax Romana. Yes,\nthe Empire was at peace, and few attacks were happening on the frontiers. Yet life in the provinces\nwas anything but truly peaceful.\n6.10.4 Early Christianity in the Context of the Roman Empire\nOne of the problems that arose in Bithynia during Pliny\u2019s time as governor in 111 \u2013 113 CE\ninvolved procedural questions on how to treat Christians in the province. Pliny does not seem\nto have much knowledge about them but is struck by what he describes as their stubbornness in\nclinging to their faith even when threatened with death. As he points out in his letter on the subject\nto Trajan, he has judged this stubbornness alone sufficient to merit punishment, presumably\nbecause it showed a dangerous level of disrespect towards Roman rule. Pliny\u2019s perspective is one\nof the earliest non-Christian sources about the new religion and shows how quickly it had spread\nover the Empire. But how and why did the new religion spread so rapidly over the Empire, and\nwhy was it so attractive to different populations? After all, quite a number of different cults and\nself-proclaimed prophets periodically appeared in the Roman world, yet none had the long-term\nimpact of Christianity, which just two centuries after Pliny\u2019s day became the religion of the Roman\nemperor himself.\nEarly Christianity is, in some ways, an ancient historian\u2019s dream: for few other topics in\nRoman history do we have so many primary sources from both the perspective of insiders and\noutsiders, beginning with the earliest days of the movement. The New Testament, in partic-\nular, is a collection of primary sources by early Christians about their movement, with some of\nthe letters composed merely twenty-five years after Jesus\u2019 crucifixion. It is a remarkably open\ndocument, collecting theological beliefs and stories about Jesus on which the faith was built. At\nthe same time, however, the New Testament does not \u201cwhite-wash\u201d the early churches; rather, it\ndocuments their failings and short-comings with remarkable frankness, allowing the historian to\nPage | 253 consider the challenges that the early Christians faced from not only the outside but also within\nthe movement.\nThe story of the origins of the faith is explained more plainly in the four Gospels, placed at\nthe beginning of the New Testament. While different emphases are present in each of the four\nGospels, the basic story is as follows: God himself came to earth as a human baby, lived a life\namong the Jews, performed a number of miracles that hinted at his true identity, but ultimately\nwas crucified, died, and rose again on the third day. His resurrection proved to contemporary\nwitnesses that his teachings were true and inspired many of those who originally rejected him to\nfollow him. While the movement originated as a movement within Judaism, it ultimately floun-\ndered in Judea but quickly spread throughout the Greek-speaking world\u2014due to the work of such\nearly missionaries as Paul. (Visit the following link to view a map of Paul\u2019s missionary journeys:\nhttp://www.allaboutturkey.com/highres/paulsjourneys.jpg.)\nIt would be no exaggeration to call the early Christian movement revolutionary. In a variety\nof respects, it went completely against every foundational aspect of Roman (and, really, Greek)\nsociety. First, the Christian view of God was very different from the pagan conceptions of gods\nthroughout the ancient Mediterranean. While\nin traditional Roman paganism the gods\nhad petty concerns and could treat humans\nunfairly, if they so wished, Christianity by\ncontrast presented the message that God\nhimself became man and dwelt with men as an\nequal. This concept of God incarnate had revo-\nlutionary implications for social relations in a\nChristian worldview. For early Christians, their\nGod\u2019s willingness to take on humanity and\nthen sacrifice himself for the sins of the world\nserved as the greatest equalizer: since God had\nsuffered for all of them, they were all equally\nimportant to him, and their social positions in\nthe Roman world had no significance in God\u2019s\neyes. Finally, early Christianity was an apoca-\nlyptic religion. Many early Christians believed\nthat Jesus was coming back soon, and they\neagerly awaited his arrival, which would erase\nall inequality and social distinctions.\nBy contrast, traditional Roman society, as\nthe conflict of the orders in the early Republic\nshowed, was extremely stratified. While the Figure 6.22 | Christ as the Good Shepherd in a\nconflict of the orders was resolved by the Third-Century CE Catacomb Painting\nAuthor: User \u201cWafflws9761\u201d\nmid-Republic, sharp divisions between the rich\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nand poor remained. While social mobility was License: Public Domain\nPage | 254 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\npossible\u2014for instance, slaves could be freed, and within a generation, their descendants could be\nSenators\u2014extreme mobility was the exception rather than the rule. Furthermore, gender roles\nin Roman society were extremely rigid, as all women were subject to male authority. Indeed, the\npaterfamilias, or head of the household, had the power of life or death over all living under his\nroof, including in some cases adult sons, who had their own families. Christianity challenged all\nof these traditional relationships, nullifying any social differences, and treating the slave and the\nfree the same way. Furthermore, Christianity provided a greater degree of freedom than women\nhad previously known in the ancient world, with only the Stoics coming anywhere close in their\nview on gender roles. Christianity allowed women to serve in the church and remain unmarried,\nif they so chose, and even to become heroes of the faith by virtue of their lives or deaths, as in\nthe case of the early martyrs. Indeed, the Passion of the Saints Perpetua and Felicity, which\ndocuments the two women\u2019s martyrdom in Carthage in 203 CE, shows all of these reversals of\nRoman tradition in practice.\nThe Passion of the Saints Perpetua and Felicity was compiled by an editor shortly after the fact\nand includes Perpetua\u2019s own prison diary, as she awaited execution. The inclusion of a woman\u2019s\nwritings already makes the text unusual, as virtually all surviving texts from the Roman world are\nby men. In addition, Perpetua was a noblewoman, yet she was imprisoned and martyred together\nwith her slave, Felicity. The two women, as the text shows, saw each other as equals, despite their\nobvious social distinction. Furthermore, Perpetua challenged her father\u2019s authority as paterfa-\nmilias by refusing to obey his command to renounce her faith and thus secure freedom. Such\noutright disobedience would have been shocking to Roman audiences. Finally, both Perpetua and\nFelicity placed their role as mothers beneath their Christian identity, as both gave up their babies\nin order to be able to be martyred. Their story, as those of other martyrs, was truly shocking in\ntheir rebellion against Roman values, but their extraordinary faith in the face of death proved\nto be contagious. As recent research shows, conversion in the Roman Empire sped up over the\ncourse of the second and third centuries CE, despite periodic persecutions by such emperors as\nSeptimius Severus, who issued an edict in 203 CE forbidding any conversions to Judaism and\nChristianity. That edict led to the execution of Perpetua and Felicity.\nMost of the early Christians lived less eventful (and less painful) lives than Perpetua and\nFelicity, but the reversals to tradition inherent in Christianity appear clearly in their lives as well.\nFirst, the evidence of the New Testament, portions of which were written as early as the 60s CE,\nshows that the earliest Christians were from all walks of life; Paul, for instance, was a tent-maker.\nSome other professions of Christians and new converts that are mentioned in the New Testament\ninclude prison guards, Roman military officials of varying ranks, and merchants. Some, like Paul,\nwere Roman citizens, with all the perks inherent in that position, including the right of appeal\nto the Emperor and the right to be tried in Rome. Others were non-citizen free males of varying\nprovinces, women, and slaves. Stories preserved in Acts and in the epistles of Paul that are part\nof the New Testament reveal ways\u2014the good, the bad, and the ugly\u2014in which these very different\npeople tried to come together and treat each other as brothers and sisters in Christ. Some of the\nstruggles that these early churches faced included sexual scandal (the Corinthian church witnessed\nthe affair of a stepmother with her stepson), unnecessary quarrelling and litigation between\nPage | 255 members, and the challenge of figuring out the appropriate relationship between the requirements\nof Judaism and Christianity (to circumcise or not to circumcise? That was the question. And then\nthere were the strict Jewish dietary laws). It is important to note that early Christianity appears to\nhave been predominantly an urban religion and spread most quickly throughout urban centers.\nThus Paul\u2019s letters address the churches in different cities throughout the Greek-speaking world\nand show the existence of a network of relationships between the early churches, despite the\nphysical distance between them. Through that network, the churches were able to carry out group\nprojects, such as fundraising for areas in distress, and could also assist Christian missionaries in\ntheir work. By the early second century CE, urban churches were led by bishops, who functioned\nas overseers for spiritual and practical matters of the church in their region.\n6.11 THE THIRD-CENTURY CRISIS, AND LATE ANTIQUITY\nWhile the second century CE was a time when the Empire flourished, the third century was a\ntime of crisis, defined by political instability and civil wars, which ultimately demonstrated that the\nEmpire had become too large to be effectively controlled by one ruler. Furthermore, the increasing\npressures on the frontiers, which required emperors to spend much of their time on campaigns,\nresulted in the decline of the importance of the city of Rome. By the end of the third century, an\nexperiment with dividing the empire showed a different model of rule, one which lasted, albeit with\nsome interludes, until the last Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in 476 CE.\nWhile the political narrative of the third century and Late Antiquity could be described as a story of\ndecline and fall of the Roman Empire (as the British historian Gibbon famously called it), neverthe-\nless, it was a period in which culture, and especially Christian culture, flourished and replaced the\ntraditional Roman pagan mode of thinking. Far from being culturally a time of \u201cdecline and fall,\u201d\nLate Antiquity, rather, was looking forward to the world of the Middle Ages. It was also the period of\nRoman history that produced some of its most influential leaders, most notably, Constantine.\n6.11.1 The Third-Century Crisis and Diocletian\nAlthough composed during a time of prosperity in the Empire, Apuleius\u2019 novel Metamorphoses\nshowed tensions in the provinces, indicative of the failure of Empire to govern all portions equally\neffectively. While not visible in the larger urban centers until the third century CE, these tensions\nmanifested themselves clearly during the third-century crisis, a period of almost fifty years (235 \u2013\n284 CE) that was characterized by unprecedented political, social, and economic upheaval across\nthe Empire. In effect, the third-century crisis was the year 69 CE repeated, but this time it\nstretched over half a century. The same secrets of power that 69 CE revealed for the first time\u2014\nthat armies could make emperors and that emperors could be made outside of Rome\u2014were now\non display yet again.\nIn 235 CE, the emperor Severus Alexander was assassinated by his troops on campaign, who\nthen proclaimed as emperor their general Maximinus Thrax. Over the subsequent half-century,\ntwenty-six emperors were officially recognized by the Roman Senate, and a number of others\nPage | 256 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nMap 6.10 | Map of the Roman Empire during the Third-Century Crisis\nAuthor: User \u201cWanwa\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nwere proclaimed emperors but did not live long enough to consolidate power and be officially\naccepted as emperors by the Senate. Most of these new emperors were military generals who\nwere proclaimed by their troops on campaign. Most of them did not have any previous political\nexperience and thus had no clear program for ruling the empire. The competing claims resulted in\nthe temporary breaking away from the Roman Empire of regions to the East and the Northwest.\nThe political instability that resulted was not, however, the only problem with which the\nEmpire had to contend. In addition to political upheaval and near-constant civil wars, the Empire\nwas also dealing with increasing pressures on the frontiers, a plague that devastated the popula-\ntion, a famine, and rampant inflation. Roman emperors, starting with Nero, had been debasing\nthe Roman coinage, but not until the third-century crisis did the inflation hit in full force.\nThe third-century crisis showed that a single emperor stationed in Rome was no longer\nequipped to deal with the challenges of ruling such a vast territory. And, indeed, so recognized\nthe man who ended the crisis: the emperor Diocletian. Born to a socially insignificant family in\nthe province of Dalmatia, Diocletian had a successful military career. Proclaimed emperor by his\ntroops in 284 CE, Diocletian promptly displayed a political acumen that none of his predecessors\nin the third century possessed. Realizing that, as the third-century crisis showed, a single emperor\nin charge of the entire empire was a \u201csitting duck,\u201d whose assassination would throw the entire\nPage | 257 empire into yet another civil war, Diocletian established a new system of rule: the Tetrarchy, or\nthe rule of four. He divided the empire into four regions, each with its own capital.\nIt is important to note that Rome was not the capital of its region. Diocletian clearly wanted to\nselect as capitals cities with strategic importance, taking into account such factors as proximity to\nproblematic frontiers. Of course, as a Dalmatian of low birth, Diocletian also lacked the emotional\nconnection to Rome that the earliest emperors possessed. Two of the regions of the Tetrarchy\nwere ruled by senior emperors, named Augusti (\u201cAugustus\u201d in the singular), and two were ruled\nby junior emperors, named Caesares (\u201cCaesar\u201d in the singular). One of the Augusti was Diocletian\nhimself, with Maximian as the second Augustus. The two men\u2019s sons-in-law, Galerius and\nConstantus Chlorus, became the two Caesares. Finally, it is important to note that in addition to\nreforming imperial rule, Diocletian attempted to address other major problems, such as inflation,\nby passing the Edict of Maximum Prices. This edict set a maximum price that could be charged on\nbasic goods and services in the Empire. He also significantly increased the imperial bureaucracy.\nMap 6.11 | Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy\nAuthor: Coppermine Photo Gallery\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 258 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nIn a nutshell, as some modern historians have\ndescribed him, Diocletian was the most signifi-\ncant Roman reformer since Augustus.\nDiocletian\u2019s political experiment was most\nclearly successful in achieving one goal: ending\nthe third-century crisis. The four men were able\nto rule the empire and restore a degree of political\nstability. A statue column of the Tetrarchs\ntogether displays their message of unity in rule:\nthe four men are portrayed identically, so it is\nimpossible to tell them apart. Showing their\npredominantly military roles, they are dressed\nin military garb, rather than the toga, the garb of\npoliticians and citizens, and each holds one hand\non the hilt of his sword and hugs one of the other\nTetrarchs with the other.\nWhile it succeeded in restoring stability to\nthe Empire, inherent within the Tetrarchy was\nthe question of succession, which turned out to\nbe a much greater problem than Diocletian had\nanticipated. Hoping to provide for a smooth\ntransition of power, Diocletian abdicated in 305\nFigure 6.23 | State Column of the Tetrarchs\nCE and required Maximian to do the same. The\nAuthor: Nino Barbieri\ntwo Caesares, junior emperors, were promptly Source: Wikimedia Commons\npromoted to Augusti, and two new Caesares License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nwere appointed. The following year, however,\nConstantius Chlorus, a newly minted Augustus, died. His death resulted in a series of wars for suc-\ncession, which ended Diocletian\u2019s experiment of the Tetrarchy. The wars ended with Constantius\u2019\nson, Constantine, reuniting the entire Roman Empire under his rule in 324 CE. In the process,\nConstantine also brought about a major religious shift in the Empire.\n6.11.2 From Constantine to the Last Pagans of Rome\nWhile traditional Roman religion was the ultimate melting pot, organically incorporating a broad\nvariety of new cults and movements from the earliest periods of Roman expansion, Christianity\u2019s\nmonotheistic exclusivity challenged traditional Roman religion and transformed Roman ways of\nthinking about religion in late antiquity.By the early fourth century CE, historians estimate that about\nten percent of those living in the Roman Empire were Christians. With Constantine, however, this\nchanged, and the previously largely underground faith grew exponentially because of the emperor\u2019s\nendorsement. The emperor\u2019s conversion must have seemed nothing short of miraculous to contem-\nporaries, and a miracle is told to explain it in contemporary sources. Before a major battle in 312\nPage | 259 CE, Constantine reportedly had a dream\nor a vision in which Christ himself told\nConstantine to place the Greek letters\nX and P (Chi, Rho, the first two letters of\nChrist\u2019s name in the Greek alphabet) on his\nsoldiers\u2019 shields in order to assure victory.\nGrateful for his subsequent victory,\nConstantine proceeded to play a major\nrole in the government of the church\nover the course of his rule, although he\nwas not baptized himself until he was on\nhis deathbed. Constantine, for instance,\nsummoned the First Council of Nicaea\nin 325 CE, which gathered major bishops\nfrom all over the Empire. The Council\nsettled, among other issues, the question\nof the relationship of God the Father and\nGod the Son, declaring them to have been Figure 6.24 | Constantine\u2019s Military Standard\none being from the creation of the world, | Reconstruction of Constantine\u2019s Military Standard,\nIncorporating the Chi Rho letters\nthus affirming the doctrine of the Trinity.\nAuthor: Nordisk Familjebok\nThe Council set a significant precedent Source: Wikimedia Commons\nfor communication of bishops in the License: Public Domain\nEmpire. It ended up being merely the first\nof seven major ecumenical councils, the last of them being the Second Council of Nicaea in 787\nCE. The councils allowed the increasingly different churches of the Eastern and Western parts of\nthe Roman Empire to work together on key doctrines and beliefs of the church.\nLast but not least, Constantine\u2019s rule marked the end of the city of Rome as the capital of\nthe Roman Empire. Upon reuniting the Empire in 324 CE, Constantine established his capital at\nthe old location of the Greek city of Byzantium, but renamed it Constantinople (the location\nof Byzantium appears on Map 6.11). The location had strategic advantages for the Empire at that\nstage. First, it had an excellent harbor. Second, it was close to the Persian frontier, as well as the\nDanube frontier, a trouble area that required attention from the emperor. Finally, building this new\ncity, to which he also referred as \u201cNew Rome,\u201d allowed Constantine to send the message that his\nrule was a new beginning of sorts for the Roman Empire, which was now to be a Christian empire.\nWith the Emperor\u2019s backing, Christianity seems to have grown exponentially over the course\nof the fourth century CE, much to the chagrin of Julian the Apostate, Rome\u2019s final pagan\nemperor, who tried hard to restore traditional Roman paganism during his brief rule (361 \u2013 363\nCE). Finally, the Emperor Theodosius gradually banned paganism altogether by 395 CE. Thus\na mere eighty-three years after Constantine\u2019s initial expression of support for Christianity, it\nbecame the official religion of Rome. Paganism continued to limp on for another century or so,\nbut without state support, it slowly died out.\nPage | 260 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\n6.11.3 The Decline of the Empire\u2014Looking Forward while Looking\nBack with Augustine and the Last Pagans of Rome\nImagine that you are a citizen of the greatest empire on earth. In fact, you reside in the greatest\ncity of the greatest empire on earth. You feel protected by the pact that was made between the\nfounders of your state and the traditional gods. The pax deorum, or peace with the gods, struck\na clear bargain: as long as you and your state worshipped the gods and maintained peace with\nthem, they would make it prosper. And prosper it did! Starting out as a tiny village on the marshes\nof the Tiber, the Roman Empire at its height encircled the entire Mediterranean, extending to\nBritain and the Rhine and Danube frontiers to the north, and including a wide strip of North\nAfrica in its southern half. But something went so terribly wrong along the way, testing the gods\u2019\npatience with Rome. A new sect started out in Judaea in the first century CE, one which followed\na crucified Messiah. Spreading outward like a wildfire to all parts of the empire, this sect chal-\nlenged and gradually replaced the worship of the traditional gods, bringing even the emperors\ninto its fold, starting with Constantine in the early fourth century CE. This outright violation of\nthe thousand-year old pact between the Romans and their gods could have only one outcome:\nthe ultimate punishment would come from the gods\nupon this rebellious state. And come it did; in 410\nCE, the unthinkable happened. The city of Rome,\nuntouched by foreign foe since the early days of the\nRepublic, was sacked by the Goths, a Germanic tribe,\nled by the fearsome Alaric. How could something so\nterrible happen? And how could the Roman Empire\nrecover from it? Such was the thought process of the\ntypical Roman pagan, and especially the pagan aris-\ntocrat, as few of those as were left by 410 CE. And\nit was in response to these questions that Augustine,\nveteran theologian, philosopher, and bishop of Hippo\nin North Africa, wrote the final magnum opus of\nhis career, the monumental twenty-two-book effort\nthat he appropriately titled De Civitate Dei Contra\nPaganos, or On the City of God against the Pagans.\nIt is no coincidence that Peter Brown, the scholar\ncredited with creating the academic field of study of\nLate Antiquity, began his career as a researcher by\nwriting a biography of Augustine. Indeed, no other\nfigure exemplifies so clearly the different culture that\nemerged in Late Antiquity, a culture of rethinking the\nFigure 6.24 | Fresco Painting of Augustine,\nSixth Century CE Roman past, with an eye to a future in which Rome\nAuthor: User \u201cMladifilozof\u201d no longer existed as the capital of the Roman Empire.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nBorn in North Africa in 354 CE, Augustine was\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 261 educated in Rome and Milan, and, after a wild youth\u2014about which he tells us in his Confessions\u2014\nhe rose to the post of the Bishop of Hippo in 396 CE. A famous figure by 410 CE, he was ideally\nsuited to address the tragedy of the sack of Rome and the concerns that this event inspired in\nChristians and pagans alike.\nIn his book, Augustine presented an argument that challenged the core of Roman traditional\nbeliefs about the state. Challenging the fundamental Roman pagan belief that Roman success\nwas the result of the pax deorum, Augustine effectively argued that there was nothing special\nabout Rome. It only prospered in its earlier history because God allowed it to do so. Furthermore,\nargued Augustine, obsession with Rome, emblematic of obsession with the earthly kingdom and\nway of life, was the wrong place for turning one\u2019s attention. The City of God was the only place\nthat mattered, and the City of God was most definitely not Rome. By turning away from this world\nand focusing on the next, one could find true happiness and identity as a citizen of God\u2019s kingdom,\nwhich is the only city that is everlasting and free from threat of invasion or destruction.\nAugustine\u2019s message would have made the Republican hero Cincinnatus weep. For\nCincinnatus, nothing was more valuable than Rome. For Augustine, however, nothing was less\nvaluable than Rome.\n6.12 CONCLUSION: FROM LATE ANTIQUITY TO THE\nMIDDLE AGES\nAfter the death of the\nEmperor Theodosius in 395 CE,\nthe Roman Empire became per-\nmanently divided into Eastern\nand Western Empires, with\ninstability and pressures on the\nfrontiers continuing, especially\nin the West.\nThe sack of Rome by the\nGoths in 410 CE, which so\nshocked Augustine\u2019s contempo-\nraries, was followed by an equally\ndestructive sack of Carthage by\nthe Vandals in 439 CE, as well as\nMap 6.12 | The Eastern and Western Roman Empires in 395 CE\ncontinuing raids of Roman ter-\nAuthor: User \u201cGeuiwogbil\u201d\nritories by the Huns, a nomadic Source: Wikimedia Commons\ntribe from Eastern Europe, the License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nCaucasus region, and south-east-\nern China. The Huns experienced an especially prolific period of conquest in the 440s and early\n450s CE under the leadership of Attila. While they were not able to hold on to their conquests\nafter Attila\u2019s death in 453 CE, their attacks further destabilized an already weakened Western\nPage | 262 CHAPTER 6: THE ROMAN WORLD FROM 753 BCE TO 500 CE\nRoman Empire. Finally, the deposition of the Emperor Romulus Augustulus in 476 CE marked\nthe end of the Roman Empire in the West, although the Eastern half of the Empire continued to\nflourish for another thousand years.\nThe fall of the Roman Empire in the West, however, was not really as clear and dramatic a fall\nas might seem. A number of tribes carved out territories, each for its own control. Over the next\nfive hundred years, led by ambitious tribal chiefs, these territories coalesced into actual kingdoms.\nRome was gone, yet its specter loomed large over these tribes and their leaders, who spoke forms\nof Latin (albeit increasingly barbaric versions of it), believed in the Christian faith, and dreamed\nof the title of Roman Emperor.\nMap 6.13 | Map of the Roman Empire in 477 CE\nAuthor: Thomas Lessman\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n6.13 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBeard, Mary, John North, and Simon Price.

The cavernous interior of St. Peter\u2019s Church\nsmelled faintly of incense. Marble columns lined the open space of the nave, which was packed with\nthe people of Rome. At the eastern end of the church, which was the most prestigious in Western\nEurope, King Charles of the Franks knelt before the pope. A tall man when standing, the Frankish\nking had an imposing presence even on his knees. He wore the dress of a Roman patrician: a tunic\nof multi-colored silk, embroidered trousers, and a richly embroidered cloak clasped with a golden\nbrooch at his shoulder. As King Charles knelt, the pope placed a golden crown, set with pearls and\nprecious stones of blue, green, and red, on the king\u2019s head. He stood to his full height of six feet\nand the people gathered in the church cried out, \u201cHail Charles, Emperor of Rome!\u201d The inside of\nthe church filled with cheers. For the first time in three centuries, the city of Rome had an emperor.\nOutside of the church, the city of Rome itself told a different story. The great circuit of\nwalls built in the third century by the emperor Aurelian still stood as a mighty bulwark against\nattackers. Much of the land within those walls, however, lay empty. Although churches of all sorts\ncould be found throughout the city, pigs, goats, and other livestock roamed through the open\nfields and streets of a city retaining only the faintest echo of its earlier dominance of the whole of\nthe Mediterranean world. Where once the Roman forum had been a bustling market, filled with\nmerchants from as far away as India, now the crumbling columns of long-abandoned temples\nlooked out over a broad, grassy field where shepherds grazed their flocks.\nPage | 267 The fountains that had once given drinking water to millions of inhabitants now went unused\nand choked with weeds. The once great baths that had echoed with the lively conversation of\nthousands of bathers stood only as tumbled down piles of stone that served as quarries for the\nmen and women who looked to repair their modest homes. The Coliseum, the great amphitheater\nthat had rung with the cries of Rome\u2019s bloodthirsty mobs, was now honeycombed with houses\nbuilt into the tunnels that had once admitted crowds to the games in the arena.\nAnd yet within this city of ruins, a new Rome sprouted from the ruins of the old. Just outside\nthe city walls and across the Tiber River, St. Peter\u2019s Basilica rose as the symbol of Peter, prince\nof the Apostles. The golden-domed Pantheon still stood, now a church of the Triune God rather\nthan a temple of the gods of the old world. And, indeed, all across Western Europe, a new order\nhad arisen on the wreck of the Roman state. Although this new order in many ways shared the\nuniversal ideals of Rome, its claims were even grander, for it rested upon the foundations of the\nChristian faith, which claimed the allegiance of all people. How this post-Roman world had come\nabout is the subject to which we shall turn.\nEver since the fifteenth century, historians of Europe have referred to the period between the\nfall of the Western Roman Empire and the Italian Renaissance (which took place in the fifteenth\nand sixteenth centuries) as the Middle Ages. The term has problems, but it is still useful because it\ndemonstrates that Europe was undergoing a transitional period: it stood between, in the middle of,\nthose times that we call \u201cmodern\u201d (after 1500 CE) and what we call the ancient world (up to around\n500 CE). This Middle Age would see a new culture grow up that combined elements of Germanic\nculture, Christianity, and remnants of Rome. It is to the political remnants of Rome that we first turn.\n7.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

The Visigoths ruled Spain in a kingdom\nthat preserved many elements of Roman culture. In Italy, the Roman general Odavacar had es-\nPage | 269 tablished his own kingdom in 476 before being murdered by the Ostrogoth king Theodoric,\nwho established a kingdom for his people in Italy, which he ruled from 493 to his death in 526.\nVandal, Visigoth, and Ostrogoth peoples all had cultures that had been heavily influenced over\ndecades or even centuries of contact with Rome. Most of them were Christians, but, crucially, they\nwere not Catholic Christians, who believed in the doctrine of the Trinity, that God is one God but\nthree distinct persons of the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. They were rather\nArians, who believed that Jesus was lesser than God the Father (see Chapter Six). Most of their\nsubjects, however, were Catholics.\nThe Catholic Church increasingly looked to the bishop of Rome for leadership. Over the fifth\ncentury, the bishop of Rome had gradually come to take on an increasing level of prestige among\nother bishops. Rome had been the city where Peter, whom tradition regarded as the chief of\nChrist\u2019s disciples, had ended his life as a martyr. Moreover, even though the power of the Western\nRoman Empire crumbled over the course of the 400s, the city of Rome itself remained prestigious.\nAs such, by the fourth and fifth centuries, the bishops of Rome were often given the title of papa,\nLatin for \u201cfather,\u201d a term that we translate into pope. Gradually, the popes came to be seen as\nMap 7.1 | The Roman Empire and Barbarian Europe 500 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nPage | 270 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nhaving a role of leadership within the wider Church, although they did not have the monarchial\nauthority that later popes would claim.\nIn the region of Gaul, the Franks were a Germanic people who had fought as mercenaries in\nthe later Roman Empire and then, with the disintegration of the Western Empire, had established\ntheir own kingdom. One key reason for the Frankish kingdom\u2019s success was that its kings received\ntheir legitimacy from the Church. In the same way that the Christian Church had endorsed the\nRoman Emperors since Constantine and, in return, these emperors supported the Church, the\nFrankish kings took up a similar relation with the Christian religion. King Clovis (r. 481 \u2013 509)\nunited the Franks into a kingdom, and, in 496, converted to Christianity. More importantly, he\nconverted to the Catholic Christianity of his subjects in post-Roman Gaul. This would put the\nFranks in sharp contrast with the Vandals, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths, all of whom were Arians.\nIn none of these kingdoms, Visigothic, Ostrogothic, Frankish, or Vandal, did the Germanic\npeoples who ruled them seek to destroy Roman society\u2014far from it. Rather, they sought homelands\nand to live as the elites of the Roman Empire had done before them. Theodoric, the king of the\nOstrogoths (r. 493 \u2013 526), had told his people to \u201cobey Roman customs\u2026 [and] clothe [them]\nselves in the morals of the toga.\u201d1 Indeed, in the generations after the end of the Western Empire\nin the late 400s, an urban, literate culture continued to flourish in Spain, Italy, and parts of Gaul.\nThe Germanic peoples often took up a place as elites in the society of what had been Roman\nprovinces, living in rural villas with large estates. Local elites shifted their allegiances from the\nvanished Roman Empire to their new rulers. In many ways, the situation of Western Europe was\nanalogous to that of the successor states of the Han Dynasty such as Northern Wei, in which an\ninvader took up a position as the society\u2019s new warrior aristocracy (see Chapter Four).\nBut even though the Germanic kings of Western Europe had sought to simply rule in the place\nof (or along with) their Roman predecessors, many of the features that had characterized Western\nEurope under the Romans\u2014populous cities; a large, literate population; a complex infrastructure of\nroads and aqueducts; and the complex bureaucracy of a centralized state\u2014vanished over the course\nof the sixth century. Cities shrank drastically, and in those regions of Gaul north of the Loire River,\nthey nearly all vanished in a process that we call ruralization. As Europe ruralized and elite values\ncame to reflect warfare rather than literature, schools gradually vanished, leaving the Church as\nthe only real institution providing education. So too did the tax-collecting apparatus of the Roman\nstate gradually wither in the Germanic kingdoms. The Europe of 500 may have looked a lot like the\nEurope of 400, but the Europe of 600 was one that was poorer, more rural, and less literate.\n7.6 BYZANTIUM: THE AGE OF JUSTINIAN\nAn observer of early sixth-century Italy would have thought that its Ostrogothic kingdom was\nthe best poised to carry forward with a new state that, in spite of its smaller size than the Roman\nEmpire, nevertheless had most of the same features. But the Ostrogothic kingdom would only\nlast a few decades before meeting its violent end. That end came at the hands of the Eastern\n1 Cassiodorus, Variae, trans. Thomas Hodgkin, in The Medieval Record: Sources of Medieval History, ed. Alfred J. Andrea\n(New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1997), 58.\nPage | 271 Roman Empire, the half of the Roman Empire\nthat had continued after the end of the Empire\nin the West. We usually refer to that empire as\nthe Byzantine Empire or Byzantium.\nThe inhabitants and rulers of this Empire\ndid not call themselves Byzantines, but rather\nreferred to themselves as Romans. Their\nempire, after all, was a continuation of the\nRoman state. Modern historians call it the\nByzantine Empire in order to distinguish it\nfrom the Roman Empire that dominated the\nMediterranean world from the first through\nfifth centuries. The Byzantine Empire or\nByzantium is called such by historians because\nByzantium had been an earlier name for its\ncapital, Constantinople.\nBy the beginning of the sixth century, the\nByzantine Army was the most lethal army\nto be found outside of China. In the late fifth\ncentury, the Byzantine emperors had built up\nan army capable of dealing with the threat of\nboth Hunnic invaders and the Sassanids, a Figure 7.1 | Mosaic of Justinianus I from the\nBasilica San Vitale\ndynasty of aggressively expansionist kings\nAuthor: Petar Milosevic\nwho had seized control of Persia in the third Source: Wikimedia Commons\ncentury. Soon this army would turn against the License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nOstrogothic kingdom of Italy.\nThe man who would destroy the Ostrogrothic as well as the Vandal kingdom was the emperor\nJustinian (r. 527 \u2013 565). Justinian had come from the ranks not of the aristocracy of the Eastern\nRoman Empire, but rather from the Army. Even before the death of his uncle, the emperor Justin I\n(r. 518 \u2013 527), Justinian was taking part in the rule of the Empire. Upon his accession to the imperial\nthrone, he carried out a set of policies designed to emphasize his own greatness and that of his empire.\nHe did so in the domain of art and architecture, sponsoring the construction of numerous\nbuildings both sacred and secular. The centerpiece of his building campaign was the church called\nHagia Sophia, Greek for \u201cDivine Wisdom.\u201d His architects placed this church in the central\nposition of the city of Constantinople, adjacent to the imperial palace. This placement was meant\nto demonstrate the close relationship between the Byzantine state and the Church that legitimat-\ned that state. The Hagia Sophia would be the principle church of the Eastern Empire for the next\nthousand years, and it would go on to inspire countless imitations.\nThis Church was the largest building in Europe. Its domed roof was one hundred and sixty\nfeet in height, and, supported by four arches one hundred and twenty feet high, it seemed to float\nin the diffuse light that came in through its windows. The interior of the church was burnished\nPage | 272 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nwith gold, gems, and marble, so that observers in\nthe church were said to have claimed that they could\nnot tell if they were on earth or in heaven. Even a\nwork as magnificent as the Hagia Sophia, though,\nshowed a changed world: it was produced with\nmortar rather than concrete, the technology for the\nmaking of which had already been forgotten.\nWhile Justinian\u2019s building showed his authority\nand right to rule which came from his close\nrelations with the Church, his efforts as a lawmaker\nshowed the secular side of his authority. Under his\ndirection, the jurist Tribonian took the previous\n900 years\u2019 worth of Roman Law and systematized\nit into a text known as the Body of Civil Law or\nthe Justinian Code. This law code, based on the\nalready-sophisticated system of Roman law, would\ngo on to serve as the foundation of European law,\nand thus of much of the world\u2019s law as well.\nAlthough the Justinian Code was based on the\nprevious nine centuries of gathered law, Roman Law\nitself had changed over the course of the fifth century\nFigure 7.2 | Haga Sophia Interior\nwith the Christianization of the Empire. By the time\nAuthor: Andreas Wanhra\nof Justinian\u2019s law code, Jews had lost civil rights to Source: Wikimedia Commons\nthe extent that the law forbade them from testifying License: Public Domain\nin court against Christians. Jews would further lose\ncivil rights in those Germanic kingdoms whose law was influenced by Roman law as well. The\nreason for this lack of Jewish civil rights was that many Christians blamed Jews for the execution\nof Jesus and also believed that Jews refused out of stubbornness to believe that Jesus had been the\nmessiah. A Christian Empire was thus one that was often extremely unfriendly to Jews.\nAs Byzantine emperor (and thus Roman emperor), Justinian would have regarded his rule\nas universal, so he sought to re-establish the authority of the Empire in Western Europe. The\nemperor had other reasons as well for seeking to re-establish imperial power in the West. Both\nVandal Carthage and Ostrogoth Italy were ruled by peoples who were Arians, regarded as heretics\nby a Catholic emperor like Justinian.\nDuring a dispute over the throne in the Vandal kingdom, the reigning monarch was over-\nthrown and had fled to the Eastern Empire for help and protection. This event gave Justinian\nhis chance. In 533, he sent his commander Belisarius to the west, and, in less than a year, this\nable and capable general had defeated the Vandals, destroyed their kingdom, and brought North\nAfrica back into the Roman Empire. Justinian then turned his sights on a greater prize: Italy,\nhome of the city of Rome itself, which, although no longer under the Empire\u2019s sway, still held a\nplace of honor and prestige.\nPage | 273 In 535, the Roman general Belisarius crossed into Italy to return it to the Roman Empire.\nUnfortunately for the peninsula\u2019s inhabitants, the Ostrogothic kingdom put up a more robust\nfight than had the Vandals in North Africa. It took the Byzantine army nearly two decades to\ndestroy the Ostrogothic kingdom and return Italy to the rule of the Roman Empire. In that time,\nhowever, Italy itself was irrevocably damaged. The city of Rome had suffered through numerous\nsieges and sacks. By the time it was fully in the hands of Justinian\u2019s troops, the fountains that had\nprovided drinking water for a city of millions were choked with rubble, the aqueducts that had\nsupplied them smashed. The great architecture of the city lay in ruins, and the population had\nshrunk drastically from what it had been even in the days of Theodoric (r. 493 \u2013 526).\nMap 7.2 | Map of The Roman Empire and Barbarian Europe 565 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\n7.6.1 The Aftermath of Justinian\nJustinian\u2019s reconquest of Italy would prove to be short-lived. Less than a decade after\nrestoring Italy to Roman rule, the Lombards, another Germanic people, invaded Italy.\nAlthough the city of Rome itself and the southern part of the peninsula remained under the rule\nPage | 274 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nof the Byzantine Empire, much of northern and central Italy was ruled either by Lombard kings\nor other petty nobles.\nBut war was only one catastrophe to trouble Western Europe. For reasons that are poorly\nunderstood even today, the long-range trade networks across the Mediterranean Sea gradually\nshrank over the sixth and seventh centuries. Instead of traveling across the Mediterranean, wine,\ngrain, and pottery were increasingly sold in local markets. Only luxury goods\u2014always a tiny\nminority of most trade\u2014remained traded over long distances.\nNor was even the heartland of Justinian\u2019s empire safe from external threat. The emperor\nHeraclius (r. 610 \u2013 641) came to power in the midst of an invasion of the Empire by the Sassanid\nPersians, who, under their king Khusrau (see Chapter Eight), threatened the Empire\u2019s very\nexistence, his armies coming within striking range of Constantinople itself. Moreover, Persian\narmies had seized control of Egypt and the Levant, which they would hold for over a decade.\nHeraclius thwarted the invasion only by launching a counter-attack into the heart of the Persian\nEmpire that resulted, in the end, in a Byzantine victory. No sooner had the Empire repelled one\nthreat than another appeared that would threaten the Empire with consequences far more severe.\nUnder the influence of the Prophet Muhammad, the tribes of the Arabian deserts had been\nunited under first the guidance of the Prophet and then his successors, the caliphs and the religion\nfounded by Muhammad, Islam (see Chapter Eight). Under the vigorous leadership of the first\ncaliphs, Arab Muslim armies invaded both Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire. At the\nBattle of Yarmouk in 636, although the Byzantines and Arabs were evenly matched, the Byzantine\nfield army was badly beaten. In the aftermath, first Syria and Palestine and then Egypt fell from\nChristian Byzantine rule to the cultural and political influence of Islam.\nThe seventh century also saw invasions by various semi-nomadic peoples into the Balkans,\nthe region between the Greek Peloponnese and the Danube River. Among these peoples were the\nTurkic Bulgars, the Avars (who historians think might have been Turkic), as well as various\npeoples known as Slavs. The Avars remained nomads on the plains of central Europe, but both\nBulgars and Slavs settled in Balkan territories that no longer fell under the rule of the Byzantine\nstate. Within a generation, the Empire had lost control of the Balkans as well as Egypt, territory\ncomprising an immense source of wealth in both agriculture and trade. By the end of the seventh\ncentury, the Empire was a shadow of its former self.\nIndeed, the Byzantine Empire faced many of the social and cultural challenges that Western\nEurope did, although continuity with the Roman state remained. In many cases, the cities of the\nByzantine Empire shrank nearly as drastically as did the cities of Western Europe. Under the\nthreat of invasion, many communities moved to smaller settlements on more easily defended\nhilltops. The great metropolises of Constantinople and Thessalonica remained centers of urban\nlife and activity, but throughout much of the Empire, life became overwhelmingly rural.\nEven more basic elements of a complex society, such as literacy and a cash economy, went\ninto decline, although they did not cease. The Byzantine state issued less money and, indeed, most\ntransactions ceased to be in cash at this time. The economy was demonetized. Even literacy\nrates shrank. Although churchmen and other elites would often still have an education, the days\nof the Roman state in which a large literate reading public would buy readily-available literature\nwere gone. As in the west, literacy increasingly became the preserve of the religious.\nPage | 275 Map 7.3 | Map of The Roman Empire and Barbarian Europe 750 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\n7.7 PERSPECTIVES: POST-ROMAN EAST AND WEST\nIn many ways, the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms of Western Europe and the Byzantine\nEmpire shared a similar fate. Both saw a sharp ruralization, that is, a decline in the number of\ninhabited cities and the size of those cities that were inhabited. Both saw plunges in literacy. And\nboth saw a state that was less competent\u2014even at tax collection. Moreover, the entire Mediterranean\nSea and its environs showed a steady decline in high-volume trade across the ocean, a decline that\nlasted for nearly two and a half centuries. By around the year 700, almost all trade was local.\nBut there remained profound differences between Byzantium and the Germanic kingdoms of\nWestern Europe. In the first place, although its reach had shrunk dramatically from the days of\nAugustus, the imperial state remained. Although the state collected less in taxes and issued less\nmoney than in earlier years, even in the period of the empires\u2019 greatest crisis, it continued to mint\nsome coins and the apparatus of the state continued to function. In Western Europe, by contrast,\nthe Germanic kingdoms gradually lost the ability to collect taxes (except for the Visigoths in\nSpain). Likewise, they gradually ceased to mint gold coins. In Britain, cities had all but vanished,\nPage | 276 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nwith an island inhabited by peoples living in small villages, the remnants of Rome\u2019s imperial\nmight standing as silent ruins.\nThe post-Roman world stands in contrast to post-Han China. Although the imperial state\ncollapsed as it had in Rome, in China, literacy never declined as drastically as it had done in\nthe Roman Empire, and the apparatus of tax collection and other features of a functional state\nremained in the Han successor states to an extent that they did not in either Rome or Byzantium.\n7.8 THE BRITISH ISLES: EUROPE\u2019S PERIPHERY2\nIn many of the lands that had been part of the\nRoman Empire, the Germanic peoples who had taken\nover western Europe built kingdoms. Although not as\nsophisticated as the Roman state, they were still recog-\nnizable as states. This situation stood in sharp contrast\nto Britain. To the northwest of Europe, the Roman Army\nhad abandoned the island of Britain in 410. The urban\ninfrastructure brought about by the Roman state began\nto decay almost immediately, with towns gradually\nemptying out as people returned to rural lifeways that\nhad existed prior to Rome\u2019s arrival.\nAt nearly the same time that the Roman Army\nwithdrew from Britain, a group of Germanic peoples\nknown as the Anglo-Saxons were moving into the\nisland from the forests of Central Europe that lay to the\neast, across the ocean. Unlike the Franks, Visigoths,\nand Ostrogoths, each of whom had kingdoms, the social\norganization of the Anglo-Saxons was comparatively\nunsophisticated. They were divided up among chiefs\nand kings who might have only had a few hundred to a\nfew thousand subjects each.\nOver the period between about 410 and 600, the\nAnglo-Saxons gradually settled in and conquered much\nFigure 7.3 | Manuscript of Bede\u2019s History\nof the English Church and People of southeastern Britain, replacing the Celtic-speaking\nAuthor: User \u201cApex infinity\u201d peoples and their language. The island of Britain was\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\none that was completely rural. All that remained of\nLicense: Public Domain\nthe state-building of the Romans was the ruins of\nabandoned cities.\n2 Although the British Isles were peripheral to global affairs and even those of Western Europe, people at the time did\nregard these islands as part of the world that people of the Middle East and Mediterranean regarded as \u201ccivilized\u201d (if only as its\nwesternmost periphery). The ninth-century Arabic writer Harun ibn Yahya said of the British that \u201cThey are the last of the lands of\nthe Greeks, and there is no civilization beyond them,\u201d quoted in Caitlin R.

In the fifth century, Christian missionaries traveled to Ireland and converted many\nof its peoples. In the early 600s, Pope Gregory the Great sent missionaries to the island of Britain.\nThe English peoples adopted Christianity (usually under the initiative of their kings) over the course\nof the next several decades, which in turn led to the founding of monasteries. These monasteries\nwould usually have attached schools so that those seeking to live as monks could have access to\nthe texts of the Bible, the liturgy, and the writings of other churchmen. English churchmen like\nBenedict Biscop (c. 628 \u2013 690) traveled south to Rome and returned to England with cartloads of\nbooks. English and Irish monks would often copy these books in their own monasteries.\nIndeed, England saw not only the copying of older books, but also the composition of original\nliterature, which was rare elsewhere in Western Europe of this time. The English churchman\nBede (672 \u2013 735) composed a history of England\u2019s people. He wrote this history to show how the\nAnglo-Saxons had adopted Christianity. Within a few decades of the island\u2019s peoples converting\nto Christianity, English and Irish monks were traveling to Western Europe, either to establish\nmonasteries in lands already Christian or to serve as missionaries to those still-pagan peoples in\nthe forests of central Europe.\n7.9 BYZANTIUM: CRISIS AND RECOVERY\nAlthough the Byzantine Empire was a remnant of the Roman state, by the eighth century\nit was much weaker than the Roman Empire under Augustus or even than the Eastern Empire\nunder Justinian. After their conquest of Egypt, the forces of the caliphate had built a navy and\nused it to sail up and lay siege to Constantinople itself in two sieges lasting from 674 to 678 and\nfrom 717 to 718. On land, to the northwest, the Empire faced the threat of the Bulgars, Slavs, and\nAvars. The Avars, a nomadic people, in particular demanded that the Byzantine state pay them a\nhefty tribute to avoid raids. At the very moment that the Empire was in greatest need of military\nstrength, it was a poorer empire than it had ever been.\nThe solution was a reorganization of the military. Instead of having a military that was paid\nout of a central treasury, the emperors divided the Empire up into regions called themes. Each\ntheme would then equip and pay soldiers, using its agricultural resources to do so. Themes in\ncoastal regions were responsible for the navy. In many ways, the theme was similar to the way\nthat other states would raise soldiers in the absence of a strong bureaucratic apparatus. One might\nliken it to what we call feudalism in Zhou China, Heian Japan, and later Medieval Europe.\nThe greatest crisis faced by the Byzantine Empire in these years of crisis was the so-called\nIconoclast Controversy. From the fourth and fifth centuries, Christians living in the Eastern\nMediterranean region had used icons to aid in worship. An icon is a highly stylized painting of\nChrist, the Virgin Mary (his mother), or the saints. Often icons appeared in churches, with the\nceiling painted with a picture of Christ or with an emblem of Christ above the entrance of a church.\nOther Christians opposed this use of images. In the Old Testament (the term Christians use\nto refer to the Hebrew Bible), the Ten Commandments forbid the making of \u201cgraven images\u201d and\nPage | 278 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nusing them in worship (Exodus 20:4-5).\nCertain Christians at the time believed\nthat to make an image even of Jesus Christ\nand his mother violated that command-\nment, arguing that to paint such pictures\nand use them in worship was idolatry,\nthat is, worshiping something other than\nGod. Muslims leveled similar critiques at\nthe Christian use of icons, claiming that\nit showed Christians had fallen from the\ncorrect worship of God into idolatry.\nEmperor Leo III (r. 717 \u2013 41) accepted\nthese arguments; consequently, in his\nreign he began to order icons removed (or\npainted over) first from churches and then\nfrom monasteries as well as other places of\npublic display. His successors took further\naction, ordering the destruction of icons.\nThese acts by Leo led to nearly a century of\ncontroversy over whether the use of icons\nin worship was permissible to Christians.\nThe iconophiles argued that to use a\npicture of Christ and the saints in worship\nwas in line with the Christian scriptures so\nFigure 7.4 | Icon of the Virgin Mary\nlong as the worshiper worshiped God with Author: User \u201cMyrabella\u201d\nthe icon as a guide, while the icolono- Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nclasts proclaimed that any use of images\nin Christian worship was forbidden.\nIn general, monks and civilian elites were iconophiles, while iconoclasm was popular\nwith the army. In Rome, which was slipping out from under the jurisdiction of the Byzantine\nemperors, the popes strongly rejected iconoclasm. Some historians have argued that Leo and\nhis successors attacked icon worship for reasons other than religious convictions alone, including\nthe fact that monks who venerated icons had built up their own power base; more importantly, in\nconfiscating the wealth of iconophile monasteries, the emperor would be able to better fund his\narmed forces.\nThe iconophile empress Irene, ruling on behalf of her infant son Constantine V (r. 780 \u2013 797),\nconvoked a new church council to bring an end to the controversy. At the 787 Second Council of\nNicaea, the Church decreed that icons could be used in worship. Final resolution of the Iconoclast\nControversy, however, would have to wait until 843, when the empress Theodora at last over-\nturned iconoclastic policies for good upon the death of her husband, the emperor Theophilus (r.\n829 \u2013 843). From this point forward, historians usually refer to the Greek-speaking churches\nPage | 279 of the eastern Mediterranean and those churches following those same patterns of worship as\nEastern Orthodox.3\nAlthough the iconoclast emperors had made enemies in the Church, they were often effective\nmilitary commanders, and they managed to stabilize the frontiers with Arabs, Slavs, and Bulgars.\nIn spite of the fact that the Byzantine armies of the eighth century would have some successes\nagainst Arabs and Slavs, it was during the eighth century that Byzantium increasingly lost control\nof Italy. While a Byzantine exarch, or governor, in Ravenna (in northeastern Italy) would rule the\ncity of Rome, even these Italian territories were gradually lost. Ravenna fell to the Lombards in\n751; the duke of Naples ceased to acknowledge the authority of the emperor in Constantinople in\nthe 750s; and the popes in Rome, long the de facto governors of the city, became effectively inde-\npendent from Byzantium in the 770s. The popes in particular would increasingly look to another\npower to secure their city: the Franks.\n7.10 WESTERN EUROPE: THE RISE OF THE FRANKS\nAt the west end of the Mediterranean and in northern Europe, the kingdom of the Franks\nwould become the dominant power of the Christian kingdoms. Justinian\u2019s armies had destroyed\nthe Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy in the sixth-century Gothic War. A century and a half later, in\n711, Arab Muslim invaders from North Africa conquered the Visigoth kingdom in Spain and estab-\nlished Muslim rule. From that time on, we refer to Muslim-ruled Spain of the early Middle Ages\nas al-Andalus. The destruction of these two kingdoms left the Franks as the dominant power\nof Western Europe. They were already the premier power in northern Gaul, but as the seventh\ncentury went on, they established themselves in southern Gaul as well, gradually subordinating\nother Germanic peoples to their rule.\nThe first dynasty of Frankish kings was known as the Merovingians, so named for Merovech,\na possibly legendary ancestor of Clovis, the first Christian king of the Franks. The Franks\u2019 power\ngrew in Western Europe for several reasons. In the first place, the Frankish monarchy had fewer\ncivil wars than did that of the Visigoths. The Frankish kingdom did face the weakness that it was\nsometimes divided among a king\u2019s sons at his death (since Germanic peoples often looked at a\nkingdom as the king\u2019s personal property), with warfare resulting within the divided kingdom.\nNevertheless, although the kingdom might be split by inheritance and later reunited, there existed\nin general a strong sense of legitimate dynastic succession. In addition, the Catholic Church\nprovided the Frankish monarchs with a sense of legitimacy as it had since the days of Clovis.\nBut as the Frankish kingdom expanded, many elements of what had characterized the Roman\nstate continued to wither. One reason for this decline was that the nature of warfare had changed\nin Western Europe. Soldiers were no longer paid out of a government treasury; instead, they were\nrewarded with lands whose surplus they would use to outfit themselves with military equipment. The\nsoldiers thus served as a warrior aristocracy. Even those families who had been Roman elites took up\n3 Modern historians use this label for convenience. At the time, both Churches in the Greek-speaking eastern Mediter-\nranean and those following the pope would have said that they were part of the Catholic Church (the word catholic comes from\na Greek word for \u201cuniversal\u201d). The churches in the eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe were coming to differ enough in\nterms of practice, worship, and thought that we can refer to them as distinct from the Catholic Church of Western Europe.\nPage | 280 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\na military lifestyle in order to prosper in the new order. In addition, the Frankish kings increasingly\nmade use of a pillage and gift system. In a pillage and gift system, a king or other war leader rewards\nhis loyal soldiers by granting them gifts that came from the plunder of defeated enemies. With armies\nfinanced either by pillage and gift or by the wealth of an individual aristocrat\u2019s lands, the Frankish\nkingdom had little reason for maintaining taxation. Moreover, the kingdom\u2019s great landowners who\nsupported the monarchy had a strong interest in seeing that they were not taxed efficiently; by the\n580s, the Frankish government had simply ceased to update the old Roman tax registers.\nOne particular role that would gain prominence among the Frankish monarchy was that of\nthe Major Domo, or Mayor of the Palace. The Mayor of the Palace was a noble who would\ngrant out lands and gifts on behalf of the king and who would, in many cases, command the army.\nGradually, one family of these Mayors of the Palace would rise to prominence above all other\nnoble families in the Frankish kingdom: the Carolingians.\nThis dominant family\u2019s more prominent members were named Charles, which in Latin is\nCarolus, hence the name Carolingians. By the mid-seventh century, the Carolingians had come\nto hold the position of Mayor of the Palace as a hereditary one. Over the early eighth century,\nthe Carolingian Mayors of the Palace had become the actual rulers of the Frankish realm, while\nthe Merovingian kings had little or no actual power. The earliest significant Carolingian major\ndomo to dominate the Carolingian court was Charles Martel (r. 715 \u2013 741). He was an able and\neffective military commander who\u2014even though he rewarded his troops with lands taken from\nthe Church\u2014was able to show himself a defender of the Christian religion by defeating a Muslim\nattack on Gaul from al-Andalus in 732 at the Battle of Tours and by defeating the Saxons,\nwho were at this point still largely pagans living in the forests to the northeast of the Frankish\nkingdom, in 738. These victories over both pagan and Muslim allowed for Martel to present his\nfamily as defenders of the Church and of the Christian religion in general.\nMartel\u2019s successor, Pepin the Short (r. 741 \u2013 68), would take the final step towards wresting\npower away from the Merovingians and making his family the kings of the Franks. He followed\nin Martel\u2019s footsteps in using the Church to shore up his legitimacy. He wrote to Pope Zachary\nI (r. 741 \u2013 752), asking whether one who exercised the power of a king should have that power,\nor if instead the person with the name of king should have that power. Pope Zachary answered\nthat kingship should rest with the person exercising its power\u2014because a king ruled the earth\non behalf of God, so a king who was not properly ruling was not doing his God-given duty. Thus\nthe last Merovingian king was deposed by the combined powers of the Carolingian Mayors of\nthe Palace and the popes. This close cooperation between Church and crown would go on to be a\ndefining feature of the Frankish monarchy.\nThe relationship between the papacy and the Carolingians not only involved the popes legiti-\nmating Pepin\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, but also included the Carolingian monarchs providing military assis-\ntance to the popes. Shortly after Zachary\u2019s letter allowing Pepin to seize power, Pepin marched\nsouth to Italy to give the pope military assistance against the Lombards. He took control of several\ncities and their surrounding hinterlands and gave these cities as a gift to the papacy. The popes\nwould thus rule a set of territories in central Italy known as the Papal States from Pepin\u2019s day\nuntil the mid-nineteenth century.\nPage | 281 The greatest of the Carolingians was the figure we refer to as Charlemagne, whose name\nmeans Charles the Great. As king of the Franks, he spent nearly the entirety of his reign leading\nhis army in battle. To the southeast, he destroyed the khanate of the Avars, the nomadic people\nwho had lived by raiding the Byzantine Empire. To the northeast of his realm, he subjugated the\nSaxons of Central Europe and had them converted to Christianity\u2014a sometimes brutal process.\nWhen the Saxons rebelled in 782, he had 4,000 men executed in one day for having returned to\ntheir old religion. To the south in Italy, Charlemagne militarily conquered the Lombard kingdom\nand made himself its king. The only area in which he was less successful was in his invasion\nof al-Andalus. Although his forces seized control of several cities and fortresses in northeastern\nSpain (to include places like Barcelona), he was, on the whole, less successful against Spain\u2019s\nUmayyad emirs. One reason for this lack of success was that, compared to Charlemagne\u2019s other\nfoes, al-Andalus was organized into a sophisticated\nstate, and so better able to resist him.\nBy the end of the eighth century, Charlemagne\nruled nearly all of Western Europe. Indeed, he ruled\nmore of Western Europe than anyone since the Roman\nemperors of four centuries before. In the winter of 800,\na mob expelled Pope Leo III from Rome. Charlemagne\ntook his troops south of the Alps and restored the\npope to his position in the Lateran palace, the palace\ncomplex to the northeast of Rome where the popes\nboth lived and conducted most of their business.\nOn Christmas Day in 800, Charlemagne was\nattending worship at St. Peter\u2019s Church. During\nthat ceremony, the pope placed a crown upon\nCharlemagne\u2019s head and declared him to be Roman\nemperor. Historians are not sure whether Charlemagne\nhad planned this coronation or had simply gone up\nto the pope for a blessing and was surprised by this\ncrown. The question of who had planned this corona-\ntion is controversial because the pope\u2019s crowning the\nemperor could have been interpreted to mean that the\ncrown was the pope\u2019s to confer.\nIndeed, it was around this time that a document\nknown as the Donation of Constantine appeared\nin Western Europe. This document was a forgery\u2014to\nthis day, scholars do not know who forged it\u2014that\nFigure 7.5 | Painting of Charlemagne |\nclaimed to have been written by the Roman emperor Charlemagne as imagined by Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nConstantine (see Chapter Six). According to this in the fifteenth century.\nAuthor: Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nforged document, the emperor Constantine had been\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\ncured of leprosy by Pope Sylvester I and, in thanks, License: Public Domain\nPage | 282 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nhad given the popes authority over all of the Western Empire. Although false, this document\nwould go on to provide the popes with a claim to rule not just central Italy, but Western Europe\nas a whole.\nCharlemagne\u2019s coronation by the pope marked the culmination of the creation of a new society\nbuilt on the wreck of the Western Roman Empire. This new society would be Christian and based\non close cooperation of Church and State\u2014although each would regard the others\u2019 sphere of\ninfluence as separate.\nMap 7.4 | Map of Carolingian Europe in 814 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\n7.11 GLOBAL CONTEXT\nAlthough Charlemagne possessed one of the most powerful armies in Europe, the\nMediterranean, and the Middle East, his empire was hardly a state compared to Tang China, the\nAbbasid Caliphate, or the Byzantine Empire. Compared to the armies of the Byzantine Emperors,\nthe Abbasid Caliphs, and above all, the Tang emperors, Charlemagne\u2019s army was merely a very\nlarge war band, financed not by a state with a working system of taxation and treasury, but rather\nby the plunder of defeated enemies. Although he issued decrees known as capitularies through\nPage | 283 the agencies of Church and state, the realm had little in the way of either bureaucracy or infrastruc-\nture, save for the decaying network of the Roman Empire\u2019s roads. Indeed, although Charlemagne\nhad sought to have a canal dug between the Rhine and Danube rivers, this project failed\u2014a fitting\nillustration of the gap between the ambitions of Charlemagne and the reality.\n7.11.1 The Carolingian Renaissance\nIn those territories that had been part of the Western Roman Empire, most of the people had\nspoken Latin, and Latin was the language of literature. By the time of the Carolingians, Latin was\nstarting to change into the languages that would eventually become French, Spanish, Italian, and\nPortuguese, languages that we call Romance because they are descended from Latin, the language\nof the Romans. The Bible, the liturgy, and writings\nof theology and on saints, however, were still in\nLatin, although the skill in reading and writing\nLatin possessed by what few people remained\nliterate had decreased, and in a less literate\nsociety, there were fewer books of Roman litera-\nture available in Western Europe. The copying of\nbooks had gradually dwindled with literacy.\nThe Carolingians were known not only for\ntheir conquests and attempted revival of the\nRoman Empire, but also for their efforts to\nimprove the state of learning in the Carolingian\nEmpire, particularly with respect to the Bible,\ntheology, and literature of Ancient Rome. They\nalso sought to increase the number of schools\nand books in the realm. Historians refer to\nthis effort as the Carolingian Renaissance.\nHistorians call it the Carolingian Renaissance\nin order to distinguish it from the later Italian\nRenaissance, an effort by northern Italian intel-\nlectuals of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\nto restore teaching and learning of the literature\nof Ancient Greece and Rome.\nCharlemagne and his successors sponsored\nan increase in learning by the Church in order\nto promote moral reform. Charlemagne, like\nhis predecessors and successors, considered\nFigure 7.6 | The Chapel of Charlemagne\u2019s\nhimself a defender and protector of the Christian\nPalace at Aachen\nreligion. As such, he wanted to make sure that Author: CEphoto, Uwe Aranas\nthe Church was promoting a reform of morality. Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 284 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nMoral reform would need to start with clergy, and these clergy would need to be able to adequately\nread the text of the Bible and of the writings of other churchmen (and \u2013women).\nCharlemagne\u2019s efforts would be centered on schools and centers of book production, what\nscholars of medieval Europe call scriptoria (singular scriptorium). He had help in that there\nwere already many high quality schools attached to monasteries that had been founded in his\nempire by English and Irish monks. The main school of his empire was the school in his palace\nat Aachen. His palace itself was based on Roman and Byzantine architecture, as a demonstration\nthat he possessed the same sort of legitimacy as the Roman Emperors. He then invited some of\nthe best scholars of Western Europe to his court\u2014including Alcuin of York (735 \u2013 804), a monk\nfrom England\u2014in order both to supervise his own court school and to direct the Church of the\nFrankish Empire to improve learning.\nThis improvement of learning included the establishment of new cathedral schools, schools\nattached to a cathedral church (i.e., a church where the bishop of a diocese\u2014the basic geo-\ngraphic division of the Church\u2014has his seat). These schools trained not only men and women\nfrom the church, but also the children of Frankish aristocrats, and in some cases women as well\nas men. As a result, an increasing number of Frankish nobles would be literate or at least would\nsponsor efforts by schools to further train people.\nLikewise, under the guidance of Charlemagne and the Frankish church, scriptoria through-\nout his empire launched on a massive new effort to copy new books. Many of these books were\nreligious in character, although Carolingian monks (and nuns) would also copy books from\nAncient Rome that had been written by pagans; many of these ancient books, like the poetry of\nVirgil (see Chapter Six), would serve as the basis of the curriculum of Western Europe\u2019s schools\nas they had since the Roman Empire. A Christian of the eighth century would believe that even\nworks by pagans would nevertheless afford their readers education and, thus, self-improvement.\n7.11.2 The Macedonian Renaissance\nThe Byzantine Empire had been that half of the Roman Empire\nwhere the language of life and culture was not Latin, but Greek. At\naround the same time as the Carolingians\u2019 efforts, the Byzantine\nEmpire also saw close cooperation of Church and State to revive\nthe study of ancient literature and improve learning. The Byzantine\nEmpire had suffered from a collapse of literacy, which, while not as\nsevere as Western Europe\u2019s, had still resulted in a much less literate\npopulation. As such, an effort similar to that of the Carolingians\nwas necessary in the Greek-speaking Eastern Mediterranean. We\ncall this effort the Macedonian Renaissance because it reached Figure 7.7 | Paris Psaulter |\nits fullest expression under a dynasty of Byzantine emperors that Picture from a Byzantine Greek\nmanuscript written during the\nwe call the Macedonian Dynasty (867 \u2013 1056).\nMacedonian Renaissance\nThe efforts of the Macedonian Dynasty, however, had begun Author: User \u201cNeuceu\u201d\nearlier. The efforts to improve the availability of books and to Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 285 increase learning began during the Iconoclast Controversy as both Iconophiles and Iconoclasts\nhad sought to back up their positions by quoting from the Bible and the Church Fathers. Emperor\nTheophilus (r. 829 \u2013 842), one of the last Iconoclast emperors, had had Leo the Mathematician\nfound a school in the emperor\u2019s palace in Constantinople, a palace known as the Magnaura. Like\nCharlemagne\u2019s palace at Aachen, this school would go on to serve as the foundation for a revived\nlearning among elites, only this learning was in Greek, rather than Latin.\nFollowing the final triumph of the Iconophiles, these efforts continued with Photius, patriarch\nof Constantinople from 858 to 867 and then from 877 to 886, as a particular sponsor of monastic\nschools in the Byzantine Empire and of the copying of books in Ancient Greek, particularly works\nlike those of Plato\u2019s philosophy and the epic poetry of Homer.\n7.11.3 Comparisons with the Abbasids\nWe should also note the global context of both the Carolingian and the Macedonian Renaissance.\nCarolingian and Macedonian Emperors were not the only ones seeking to increase the availability\nof ancient texts from the time of the Greeks and Romans. The Abbasid Caliphs under al-Mamun\n(r. 813 \u2013 883) and his successors also sponsored the work of the House of Wisdom, whose scholars\ntranslated the philosophy of the Ancient Greeks into Arabic. Like the Christians of the Carolingian\nand Byzantine Empires, the Muslims of the Caliphate believed that one could learn from pagan\nwriters even if they had not believed in the one Creator God.\n7.12 DAILY LIFE IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE\nBYZANTINE EMPIRES\nIn both Western Europe and Byzantium, the vast majority of the population was made up of\nfarmers. In Western Europe, some of these were what we call dependent farmers, living on the\nlands of aristocrats and giving over much of their surplus to their landlords. But in many villages,\nthe majority of farmers might live on their own land and even enjoy a form of self-government.\nAlthough some slavery existed\u2014especially in zones of conflict like the Mediterranean\u2014compared\nto the days when vast estates had been worked by unfree labor (see Chapter Six), the workers on\nthe estates of the Frankish aristocracy or those free and independent farmers enjoyed greater\nfreedom than had their Roman counterparts. But their life was precarious. Crop yields were low,\nat ratios of around 3:1\u2014meaning only giving back about three times as much as was planted\u2014and\nthe average Carolingian farmer frequently did not get adequate calories.\nSo too did most of the population of the Byzantine Empire live in small villages, living at a\nsubsistence level, and selling what rare surplus they had. Byzantium, like its Western European\ncounterpart, was fundamentally rural.\nThe nobles of Western Europe were generally part of a warrior aristocracy. These aristocrats\noften outfitted and equipped themselves based on the wealth of their lands. Their values were\nthose of service to their king and loyalty and bravery in battle. Nobles would often not live on their\nlands but follow the royal court, which would itself travel from place to place rather than having a\nPage | 286 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nfixed location. Battle may have been frequent, but until Charlemagne, the scale of battle was often\nsmall, with armies numbering a few hundred at most.\nAlong with its warrior aristocracy, gender roles in the Frankish kingdom\u2014like those of the\nRoman Empire that came before it\u2014reflected a patriarchal society. The Christian religion generally\ntaught that wives were to submit to their husbands, and the men who wrote much of the religious\ntexts often thought of women in terms of weakness and temptations to sexual sin. \u201cYou,\u201d an early\nChristian writer had exclaimed of women, \u201care the devil\u2019s gateway\u2026you are the first deserter of\nthe divine law\u2026you destroyed so easily God\u2019s image, man\u2026\u201d4 The warlike values of the aristocracy\nmeant that aristocratic women were relegated to a supporting role, to the management of the\nhousehold. Both Roman and Germanic law placed women in subordination to their fathers and\nthen, when married, to their husbands.\nThat said, women did enjoy certain rights. Although legally inferior to men in Roman Law\n(practiced in the Byzantine Empire and often among those peoples who were subjects of the\nGermanic aristocracies), a wife maintained the right to any property she brought into a marriage.\nWomen often played a strong economic role in peasant life, and, as with their aristocratic counter-\nparts, peasant women often managed the household even if men performed tasks such as plowing\nand the like. And the Church gave women a fair degree of autonomy in certain circumstances. We\noften read of women choosing to become nuns, to take vows of celibacy, against the desires of their\nfamilies for them to marry. These women, if they framed their choices in terms of Christian devotion,\ncould often count on institutional support in their life choices. Although monasticism was usually\nlimited to noblewomen, women who became nuns often had access to an education. Certain noble-\nwomen who became abbesses could even become powerful political actors in their own right, as did\nGertrude of Nivelles (c. 621 \u2013 659), abbess of the monastery of Nivelles in what is today Belgium.\n7.13 CAROLINGIAN COLLAPSE\nCharlemagne\u2019s efforts to create a unified empire did not long outlast Charlemagne himself. His\nson, Louis the Pious (r. 814 \u2013 840), succeeded him as emperor. Louis continued Charlemagne\u2019s\nproject of Church reform; unlike Charlemagne, who had had only one son to survive into\nadulthood, Louis had three. In addition, his eldest, Lothar, had already rebelled against him in\nthe 830s. When Louis died, Lothar went to war with Louis\u2019s other two sons, Charles the Bald and\nLouis the German. This civil war proved to be inconclusive, and, at the 843 Treaty of Verdun,\nthe Carolingian Empire was divided among the brothers. Charles the Bald took the lands in the\nwest of the Empire, which would go on to be known first as West Francia and then, eventually,\nFrance. To the East, the largely German-speaking region of Saxony and Bavaria went to Louis the\nGerman. Lothar, although he had received the title of emperor, received only northern Italy and\nthe land between Charles\u2019s and Louis\u2019s kingdoms.\nThis division of a kingdom was not unusual for the Franks\u2014but it meant that there would be\nno restoration of a unified Empire in the West, although both the king of Francia and the rulers of\nCentral Europe would each claim to be Charlemagne\u2019s successors.\n4 Tertullian, On the Apparel of Women, 1:1.\nPage | 287 Map 7.5 | Map of Carolingian Europe in 843 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nWestern Europe faced worse problems than civil war between the descendants of Charlemagne.\nIn the centuries following the rise of the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms, Western Europe had\nsuffered comparatively few invasions. The ninth and tenth centuries, by contrast, would be an\n\u201cage of invasions.\u201d\nIn the north of Europe, in the region known as Scandinavia, a people called the Norse had lived\nfor centuries before. These were Germanic peoples, but one whose culture was not assimilated to\nthe post-Roman world of the Carolingian west. They were still pagan and had a culture that, like\nthat of other Germanic peoples, was quite warlike. Their population had increased; additionally,\nNorse kings tended to exile defeated enemies. These Norsemen would often take up raiding other\npeoples, and when they took up this activity, they were known as Vikings.\nOne factor that allowed Norse raids on Western Europe was an improvement in their con-\nstruction of ships. Their ships were long, flexible, and also had a shallow enough draft that\nthey did not need harbors so could be pulled up along any beach. Moreover, they were also\nshallow enough of draft that they could sail up rivers for hundreds of miles. What this feature\nof these ships meant was that Norse Vikings could strike at many different regions, often with\nvery little warning.\nPage | 288 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nEven more significant for the Norse\nattacks was that Western Europe in the\nninth and tenth centuries was made up of\nweak states. The three successor kingdoms\nto Charlemagne\u2019s empire were often split\nby civil war. Although King Charles the\nBald (r. 843 \u2013 877) enjoyed some successes\nagainst the Vikings, his realm in general\nwas subject to frequent raids. England\u2019s\nsmall kingdoms were particularly vul-\nnerable. From 793, England had suffered\nnumerous Viking raids, and these raids\nincreased in size and scope over the ninth\ncentury. Likewise, to the west, Ireland,\nwith its chiefs and petty kings, lacked the\norganization of a state necessary to deal\nwith sustained incursions.\nThe result was that not only did Viking\nFigure 7.7 | Modern Replica of a Viking ship\nAuthor: William Murphy raids on the British Isles increase in scope\nSource: Wikimedia Commons and intensity over the ninth century, but\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.0\nalso the Norse eventually came to take\nlands and settle.\nTo the south and west, al-Andalus suffered fewer Norse attacks than did the rest of Europe.\nA sophisticated, organized state with a regular army and a network of fortresses, it was able to\neffectively deal with raiders. The Spanish emir Abd-al Rahman II defeated a Viking raid and sent\nthe Moroccan ambassador the severed heads of 200 Vikings to show how successful he had been\nin defending against them.\nTo the east, the Norse sailed along the rivers that stretched through the forests and steppes\nof the area that today makes up Russia and Ukraine. The Slavic peoples living there had a com-\nparatively weak social organization, so in many instances they fell under Norse domination. The\nNorsemen Rurik and Oleg were said to have established themselves as rulers of Slavic peoples as\nwell as the princedoms of Novgorod and Kiev, respectively, in the ninth century. These kingdoms\nof Slavic subjects and Norse masters became known as the Rus.\nFurther to the south, the Norse would often move their ships over land between rivers until\nfinally reaching the Black Sea and thus Constantinople and Byzantium. Although on occasion a\nNorse raid would have great success against Byzantine forces, in general, a powerful and organized\nstate meant that, as with al-Andalus, the Norse encountered less success.\nNorse invaders were not the only threat faced by Western Europe. As the emirs of Muslim\nNorth Africa gradually broke away from the centralized rule of the Abbasid Caliphate (see Chapter\nEight), these emirs, particularly those of Tunisia, what is today Algeria, and Morocco turned to\nPage | 289 legitimate themselves by raid and plunder; this aggression was often directed at southern Francia\nand Italy. The Aghlabid emirs in particular not only seized control of Sicily, but also sacked the city\nof Rome itself in 846. North African raiders would often seize territory on the coasts of Southern\nEurope and raid European shipping in order to increase their own control of trade and commerce.\nIn addition, the emirs of these North African states would use the plunder from their attacks to\nreward followers, in another example of the pillage and gift system.\nMap 7.6 | Map of The Vikings c. 1000 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nCentral Europe also faced attacks, these from the Magyars, a steppe people. The Magyars had\nbeen forced out of Southeastern Europe by another steppe people, the Pechenegs, and so from\n899 on migrated into Central Europe, threatening the integrity of East Francia. As was the case\nwith other steppe peoples, their raids on horseback targeted people in small unfortified communi-\nties, avoiding larger settlements. They eventually settled in the plains of Eastern Europe to found\nthe state of Hungary; although they made Hungary their primary location, they nevertheless\ncontinued to raid East Francia through the first part of the tenth century.\nPage | 290 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\n7.13.1 An Age of Invasions in Perspective\nNorse, Magyar, and Muslim attacks on Europe wrought incredible damage. Thousands died,\nand tens of thousands more were captured and sold into slavery in the great slave markets of North\nAfrica and the Kievan Rus. These raids furthered the breakdown of public order in Western Europe.\nBut these raids had effects that also brought long-term benefits. Both Norse and Muslim\npirates traded just as much as they raided. Indeed, even the plunder of churches and selling of the\ngold and silver helped create new trade networks in both the North Sea and Mediterranean. These\nnew trade networks, especially where the Norse had established settlements in places like Ireland,\ngradually brought about an increase in economic activity.\nAll told, we should remember this \u201cage of invasions\u201d in terms both of its human cost and of the\neconomic growth it brought about.\n7.13.2 New States in Response to Invasions\nIn response to the invasions that Europe faced, newer, stronger states came into being in the\nBritish Isles and in Central Europe. In England, Norse invasions had destroyed all but one of the\nAnglo-Saxon kingdoms. The only remaining kingdom was Wessex. Its king, Alfred the Great (r.\n871 \u2013 899), was able to stop Norse incursions by raising an army and navy financed by a king-\ndom-wide tax. This tax, known as the geld, was also used to finance the construction of a network\nof fortresses along the frontier of those parts of England still controlled by the Norse. This new\nsystem of tax collection would eventually mean that England, a small island on the periphery,\nwould eventually have the most sophisticated bureaucracy in Western Europe (although we must\nnote that in comparison with a Middle Eastern or East Asian state, this bureaucracy would be\nconsidered rudimentary and primitive).\nLikewise, in Central Europe, the kings of East Francia, the region made up of those Saxon\nterritories the Carolingians had conquered in the eighth century as well as various peoples to the\nsouth and east, gradually built a kingdom capable of dealing with Magyar invaders. Henry the\nFowler (r. 919 \u2013 936) took control of East Francia after the end of the Carolingian Dynasty. He\nwas succeeded by Otto the Great (r. 936 \u2013 973), whose creation of a state was partially the result\nof luck: his territory contained large silver mines that allowed him to finance an army. This army\nwas able to decisively defeat the Magyar raiders and also allow these kings to expand their power\nto the east, subjugating the Slavic peoples living in the forests of Eastern Europe.\n7.14 THE TENTH-CENTURY CHURCH\nAs a result of endemic chaos in Western Europe, the Church suffered as well. The moral and intel-\nlectual quality of bishops and abbots declined sharply, as church establishments fell under the dom-\nination of warlords. These warlords would often appoint members of their families or personal allies\nto positions of leadership in the Church, appointments based not on any competence or sense of ded-\nication to duty, but rather on ties of loyalty. This was the case even in Rome, when families of Roman\nnobles fought over the papacy. Between 872 and 965, twenty-four popes were assassinated in office.\nPage | 291 7.15 BYZANTINE APOGEE: THE MACEDONIAN EMPERORS\nFor Byzantium, however, the ninth and tenth centuries represented a time of recovery and\nexpansion. In the first place, the height of the Macedonian Renaissance took place in the later\nninth and tenth centuries, resulting in a growth of learning among both clergy and lay elites.\nThis growth of learning took place against the backdrop of military success by the emperors of\nthe Macedonian Dynasty (867 \u2013 1056). The first emperor of this dynasty, Basil I (r. 867 \u2013 886), a\nsoldier and servant of the emperor, had come from a peasant background. He seized control of the\nEmpire when he murdered the reigning emperor and took the position for himself.\nBasil was an effective emperor. To the east, as the Abbasid Caliphate broke down, he inflicted\nseveral defeats on the Arab emirs on the border, pushing the frontiers of the Empire further east.\nAlthough unsuccessful in fighting to maintain control of Sicily, he re-established Byzantine control\nover most of southern Italy.\nIt was under the Macedonian emperors that the Eastern Orthodox culture of the Byzantines\nspread north beyond the borders of the Empire. In 864, the Bulgar khan, whose predecessors had\nbeen building a state of their own, converted to Christianity and was baptized. This conversion\nallowed the Bulgar state to be legitimated by the Church in the same manner as had the Byzantine\nEmpire and the kingdoms of Western Europe.\nIn the ninth century, Cyril and Methodius,\nmissionaries from the city of Thessalonica,\npreached Orthodox Christianity to the Slavic\npeoples of Eastern Europe and devised the\nalphabet that we today call Cyrillic in order to\nwrite the Bible and liturgy in their own language,\nSlavonic. By bringing Orthodox Christianity\nto the Slavic peoples, the Byzantines brought\nthem into the culture of the Byzantines.\nSubsequent emperors maintained this\nrecord of successes. John Tzimisces (r. 969 \u2013\n976) established Byzantine control over most of\nSyria. Basil II (r. 976 \u2013 1025) achieved further\nsuccesses, crushing and annexing the Bulgar\nstate that had grown up in the lands south of\nthe Danube and further subordinating the\nArmenian kingdoms to the Byzantine emperor.\nBy the end of his reign, the Byzantine territory\nencompassed about a fourth of what had been\nthe Roman Empire at its height under Augustus.\nFigure 7.9 | Basil II Basil II had further diplomatic triumphs.\nAuthor: User \u201cTokle\u201d He allied with the princes of the Kievan Rus,\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\na state that had grown up in Eastern Europe\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 292 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\nalong the rivers between the Baltic\nSea and the Black Sea. The Rus was\na people group made up of a largely\nSlavic population, with rulers who\nwere ethnically Norse and who had\nestablished themselves as rulers of\nboth Slavic and Turkic subjects when\nthey sailed down the rivers of Eastern\nEurope from their Scandinavian\nhomeland. This was a hybrid culture\nalready, combining Norse and Slavic.\nAn alliance with the Byzantine Empire\nalso brought Greek elements into the\ncultural mix. In 988, Kievan Grand\nPrince Vladimir (r. 980 \u2013 1015) was\nbaptized into the Christian religion\nand became a close ally of Basil II,\nsealing the alliance by marrying\nBasil\u2019s sister, Anna. The elite culture\nof the Rus would come to reflect both\nGreek, Slavic, Norse, and also Turkic\nelements. Allying with these people\nhad brought Basil II to the height of\nFigure 7.10 | Baptism of Grand Prince Vladimir\nthe Byzantine state\u2019s power.\nAuthor: Viktor M.

Just as the Han State\nhad fragmented politically in the third century and given rise to smaller states ruled by warrior\naristocracies, so too had Rome fragmented into its eastern half and a series of Germanic kingdoms,\nthemselves ruled by warrior aristocracies. Just as Mahayana Buddhism had arrived in post-Han\nChina, so too had Christianity become the dominant faith of the Roman Empire and its successors.\nAnd yet, these similarities in the end are superficial. All of China\u2019s successor states maintained\na continuity of bureaucracy and literacy to an extent that Western Europe did not. Moreover,\nalthough Mahayana Buddhism would become a key element of East Asian culture, it would never\nPage | 294 CHAPTER 7: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 500 - 1000 CE\ncome to enjoy a monopoly of power that Christianity enjoyed in Western Europe and Byzantium\nand that Islam enjoyed in Spain, the Middle East, and North Africa. The less exclusivist nature of\nMahayana Buddhism would mean that it would always be one set of practices among many.\nAnd the greatest difference is that China eventually saw a return to a unified empire under the\nSui and then Tang Dynasties. In spite of Charlemagne\u2019s efforts to create a new Empire in the west,\nthe story of Western Europe would be one of competing states rather than an empire claiming\nuniversal authority.\n7.17 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBackman, Clifford R.

There, present day Tunisia,\nhe received a traditional Islamic education until his parents died from the plague. At the time of\ntheir deaths, he was just seventeen years old. On his own, the young and resourceful Ibn Khaldun\nexploited personal relationships to secure an administrative position at court and thus began\na career as an itinerant statesman. Time and time again, Ibn Khaldun landed in prison for his\nrole in conspiracies against various ruling dynasties, only to be released by their heirs. Envoys\nand grandees recognized his remarkable intelligence and the value of his council. His reputation\npreceded him, and many dignitaries openly entreated him to join their court. Serving various\ndynasties, Ibn Khaldun held many important offices, like diplomat, court advisor, and prime\nminister. But he eventually grew weary of the hazards of palace intrigue and sought instead a\nmore reclusive lifestyle.\nIbn Khaldun retired to the safety of a Berber tribe in Algeria, where he composed al-Muqad-\ndimah, or Prolegomenon, an outstanding work of sociology and historiography. Published in\n1377, he theorized in al-Muaqddimah that tribal \u2018asabiyah, roughly translated as \u201csocial soli-\nPage | 296 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\ndarity,\u201d is often accompanied by a novel religious ideology that helps a previously marginalized\ngroup of people, usually from the desert, rise up and conquer the city folk. Once ensconced in\npower, these desert peoples evolved into a grand civilization, but \u2018asabiyah contained within it\ndestructive elements that could precipitate their collapse. Known for this Cyclical Theory of\nHistory, Ibn Khaldun posited that, seduced by the wiles of urban culture, the dominant group\nwould over time become soft and enter into a period of decay, until a new group of desert peoples\nconquered them, when the process would begin anew. This theory applies to the development of\nIslamic history discussed throughout this chapter.\n8.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1. How does geography play a role in Islamic history?\n2.

However, for the purposes of this\nchapter, this region will encompass the broadly\ndefined areas known as Persia, Mesopotamia,\nthe Levant, Asia Minor, and the Arabian\nPeninsula. The Middle East straddles three\ncontinents, including Asia, Africa, and Europe.\nThe geography of the area promoted cultural\ndiffusion by facilitating the spread of peoples,\nideas, and goods along overland and maritime\ntrade routes. In an area generally characterized\nby its aridity, climate has influenced settle-\nment patterns. Larger settlements are found in\nriver valleys and well-watered areas along the\nlittoral. In these areas, we see the development Map 8.1 | Map of the Middle East\nand spread of productive agriculture. Author: User \u201cTownDown\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n8.6 RISE OF ISLAM\nLegend traces the Arabs back to Isma\u2018il, the son of Abraham and his Egyptian maid, Haga, a\nlink that would later help to legitimize Islam by connecting it to the Hebrew tradition. In reality,\nArabs inhabited the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula and shared socio-linguistic commonalities\nwith such other Semitic-speaking peoples in the area as the Hebrews, Assyrians, Arameans, and\neven the Amhara of Ethiopia. Most of the population of Arabia prior to the rise of Islam resided in\nthe south of the peninsula, in modern day Yemen, where they practiced terraced agriculture and\nherded ruminants in a relatively small area.\nFarther to the north of Yemen, along the highland spine of western Arabia and up against the\nlittoral of the Red Sea, was the Hijaz, a prominent cultural and economic region. Situated in this\nremote fastness was the dusty city of Mecca, the holiest place in the peninsula and the location\nPage | 299 of the Ka\u2018ba, or \u201ccube,\u201d which\ncontained many of the traditional\nArabian religious images, including\nmany Christian icons. So important\nwas the Ka\u2018ba to the religion of poly-\ntheistic tribes of Arabia that they\nnegotiated a truce lasting one month\nevery year that allowed for safe pil-\ngrimage to the shrine.\nThe Hijaz was the most arable\npart of the Arabian Peninsula north\nof Yemen and distinguished by\nirrigated agriculture that supported\nfruit trees and essential grains. Local\ntraders exported a range of Hijazi\nagricultural products to Syria in\nMap 8.2 | Map of the Hijaz Region of Arabia\nthe north in return for imperative\nAuthor: User \u201cTUBS\u201d\nimports like textiles and olive oil so Source: Wikimedia Commons\nthe region benefited from robust License: CC BY-SA 3.0\ntrade. Regional commerce depended\non the security of trade, and piracy on the Red Sea threatened to disrupt business. Under these\nconditions, merchants diverted their trade overland. Many goods journeyed up the Red Sea Rift\nfrom Yemen on their way to the eastern Mediterranean. Caravans of camels carried these goods,\nas well as Hijazi exports, to the Levant.\nMost of the caravans stopped in\nMecca, the halfway point up the spine\nof the peninsula, thus their commerce\nbrought much needed wealth and tax\nrevenue to the city.\nThe Arabs first domesticated the\ncamel, probably sometime between\n3000 and 1000 BCE. Caravan\noperators eventually availed them-\nselves of these useful dromedaries\nbecause they were so adept at crossing\nthe region\u2019s massive deserts. Capable\nof drinking 100 liters of water in mere\nminutes, they could endure days of\nFigure 8.1 | The Mountains of the Hijaz travel without needing to replenish\nAuthor: User \u201cSalem1990\u201d\nthemselves again. Moreover, camels\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 instinctively remembered the locations\nPage | 300 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nMap 8.3 | The Tribes of Arabia | Notice the Quraysh tribe of Mecca.\nAuthor: User \u201cSlackerlwastudent\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nof important, life-sustaining oases. So important were these beasts of burden that the tribes that\ncontrolled the camels controlled the trade. And the Quraysh Tribe of Mecca commanded many of\nthe camels in the Hijaz region; therefore, they commanded much of the trade.\nLife in the Arabian Peninsula centered around the tribe, which usually consisted of a group of\nrelatives who claimed a shared ancestry. Tribal traditions found meaning in the poetic concept of\nmuruwah, which represented the notion of the ideal tribal man. This uniquely Arabian brand of\nchivalry focused on bravery, patience, persistence in revenge, generosity, hospitality, and protection\nof the poor and weak. In the absence of formal government, tribes offered physical security to its\nindividual members. Tribes mitigated violence and theft through the shared understanding that\nretribution for such acts would follow swiftly. Tribes also organized to compete over increasingly\nPage | 301 scarce resources, as they had a responsibility to provide for the economic needs of their individu-\nal members. Nevertheless, tribal traditions had been breaking down prior to the rise of Islam; no\nlonger were the dominant members of society adhering to the principles set forth in muruwah.\nInto this evolving cultural milieu Muhammad (c.570 \u2013 632) was born in the city of Mecca.\nMuhammad\u2019s father, \u2018Abdallah, was a member of the Hashimite Clan, a less prosperous branch of\nthe Quraysh Tribe. \u2018Abdullah died just prior to his son\u2019s birth, and Muhammad\u2019s mother passed\naway when he was just six years old. Orphaned at such a young age, his tribe intervened to ensure\nMuhammad\u2019s survival. His uncle, Abu Thalib, the leader of the Hashimite Clan and an important\nmember of the Quraysh Tribe, eventually took custody of the young boy. These early privations\ninfluenced Muhammad\u2019s later desire to take care of those who could not care for themselves.\nIn his youth, Muhammad found employment in the regional caravan trade as a dependable\nherder and driver of camels. During this period, he cultivated a reputation of an empathetic and\nhonest man, one who earned the respect of many Meccans. His upright character soon attracted\nthe attention of a wealthy merchant known as Khadija who hired Muhammad to manage her\ncaravans. Once Muhammad proved his reliability, Khadija, who was fifteen years older than\nMuhammad, proposed to him, and they married. This marriage afforded Muhammad a financial\nsecurity that allowed him to begin meditating on religion in the abstract.\nMuhammad had been concerned about the direction society had recently been taking and\nthat the concepts defined by muruwah were no longer being upheld. He believed that some of\nthe most influential members of society, namely the merchant elite of the Quraysh Tribe, were\nno longer respecting their traditional responsibilities to the weaker members of society because\nof their own greed. He thought that the People of the Book, specifically, Christians and Jews,\nmight have a better answer for the ills afflicting Meccan society. Muhammad had contact with\nthe Christians and Jews of the peninsula and even traveled to Christian Syria while working in\nthe caravan trade. In this context, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad at a cave nearby to\nMecca in 610, during the holy month of Ramadan. The Angel Gabriel instructed him to \u201crecite,\u201d\nand then he spoke the divine word of God. His revelations became the Quran.\nAt first, Muhammad displayed the very human reactions of fear and distrust to the apparition\nof the Angel Gabriel. He also expressed embarrassment because he did not want to be associated\nwith the pagan diviners of the region. Fortunately, his wife Khadija had a cousin who was a hanif,\nsomeone who was neither a Christian nor a Jew, but who believed in a vague concept of a mono-\ntheistic god. Her cousin trusted the veracity of Muhammad\u2019s revelations. So with trepidation,\nMuhammad eventually accepted his role as God\u2019s vehicle. His wife became the first convert to\nIslam, with Abu Thalib\u2019s son \u2018Ali converting soon afterwards.\n8.6.1 The Religion of Islam\nAs a religion of the Abrahamic faith, Islam holds much in common with Judaism and\nChristianity. Islam grew out of the Judeo-Christian tradition, a link which helped to legitimize\nthe new religion. In fact, Muslims believe in the same God, or Allah in Arabic, as the Jewish and\nChristian God. Although Muslims trust that the People of the Book had received the word of\nPage | 302 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nGod, they believe that it had become\ndistorted over time, so God sent the\nAngel Gabriel to deliver His word to\nMuhammad, the Seal of the Prophets,\nor Khatam an-Nabiyyin, for Muslims\nbelieve that he represented God\u2019s\nfinal word to man. Muhammad\nnever claimed to be founding a new\nreligion, rather he served as the\nlast in a long line of God\u2019s messen-\ngers, beginning with the Hebrew\nprophets, and including Jesus. His\nrevelations, therefore, represent the\nFigure 8.2 | The Birmingham Quran Manuscript | Dated\npure, unadulterated version of God\u2019s among the oldest in the World.\nmessage. The Prophet\u2019s followers Author: Anonymous\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nmemorized the revelations and ul-\nLicense: Public Domain\ntimately recorded them in a book\ncalled the Quran. Together with the\nQuran, the Hadith, traditions of Muhammad used to illustrate a concept, and the Sunna, the\nteachings of the Prophet not found in the Quran, helped guide and inform Muslims on proper\nbehavior. And with that knowledge came great responsibility, as God held His people to a high\nstandard of behavior, based on their obedience, or submission to His will. In fact, the word Islam\nmeans submission in Arabic, and a\nMuslim is one who submits (to God).\nDerived from a Hadith, the Five\nPillars of Islam are essential, oblig-\natory actions that serve as the foun-\ndation of the faith. The first pillar,\nknown as the witness, or shahada,\nis a profession of faith, in which\nbelievers declare that \u201cThere is no\nGod but God, and Muhammad is\nHis messenger.\u201d Prayer, also called\nsalat, is the second pillar of Islam.\nIslam expects faithful Muslims\nto pray five times a day, kneeling\ntowards Mecca, at dawn, noon,\nFigure 8.3 | Pilgrimage to Mecca | Notice the prominently afternoon, sunset, and evening. One\nfeatured Ka\u2018ba. should perform ritual ablutions prior\nAuthor: User \u201cBotMultichillT\u201d\nto their prayers in order to approach\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.0 God as being symbolically clean and\nPage | 303 pure. The third pillar is almsgiving, or zakat in Arabic. Islam requires Muslims to contribute\na proportion of their wealth to the upkeep of the Islamic community. This proportion, or tithe,\naccorded with the size of one\u2019s wealth; therefore, the rich should expect to contribute more than\nthe poor. Fasting, or sawm, is the fourth pillar of Islam and takes place during Ramadan, the\nninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. For the duration of Ramadan, believers consume\nneither food nor drink from dawn to dusk. This practice is meant to remind them of what it is like\nto be poor and go hungry. The fifth and final pillar of Islam is pilgrimage, or hajj. Islam expects\nall able-bodied Muslims to make a journey to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. All five pillars\ncombine to unite the Islamic community.\n8.7 THE EXPANSION OF ISLAM\nThe Prophet Muhammad started publically preaching his strict brand of monotheism in the\nyear 613, by reciting the Quran, quickly convincing some of the commoners of Mecca to believe\nin him. Most of his early converts belonged to groups of people who had failed to achieve any\nsignificant social mobility, which, of course, included many of the poor. His followers memorized\nhis recitations and message that called for the powerful to take care of the weak, a message that\nresonated with many of these economically and socially marginalized. Islam served as a binding\nforce, replacing tribal solidarity, or \u2018asabiyah.\nMuhammad\u2019s message challenged the Umayyad Clan\u2019s leadership of society. The most\npowerful branch of the Quraysh Tribe, the Umayyads had been enriching themselves from the\nlucrative caravan trade while, at the same time, ignoring the privations of the needy. Prodding\nhis tribal brethren, Muhammad had also spoken out against the traditional pagan gods. Tribal\ntradition dictated that the polytheistic Arabs of the peninsula worship their tribal gods; they also\nbelieved in jinns, or nature spirits. As custodians of the Ka\u2018ba, which contained all of these tradi-\ntional Arabian religious images, the Umayyad Clan augmented their income by collecting revenue\nfrom the traditional pilgrimage to Mecca.\nThe political implications were clear. The Muslims threatened to disrupt a delicate equilibri-\num. The Prophet\u2019s message jeopardized the social and economic standing of the elite members\nof society, who accused the Muslims of serving as agents of unwelcome change. Tensions grew,\nand conflict spilled into the streets of Mecca, dragging the two respective camps into the fray.\nThe more that Muhammad\u2019s followers grew in number, the more opposition they encountered\nfrom the Umayyad Clan. To avoid this conflict, some Muslims fled to the Kingdom of Aksum,\nlocated in Ethiopia, at this stage in the early history of Islam, where they received protection from\nMuhammad\u2019s enemies under the Christian King Armah. Indeed, the first Muslims went by the\nname of muhajirun, meaning \u201cemigrants,\u201d for they would soon be forced to leave Mecca under\npain of severe Umayyad persecution.\nDuring this period, Muhammad\u2019s wife Khadija died in 619. With her death, Muhammad lost his\nsource of emotional support and fell into depression, thus enduring a personal crisis. That same year,\nthe Prophet\u2019s uncle Abu Thalib passed away. Already bereaved, Muhammad further suffered the loss\nof his personal protector in the Quraysh Tribe. Now cut off from the tribal leadership and accused\nPage | 304 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nof stirring sectarian tension,\nMuhammad was on his own\nand vulnerable to Umayyad\nharassment in Mecca.\nWhile Muhammad en-\ndured harsh reprisals from\nthe Umayyads for his pub-\nlic preaching, a conflict was\nboiling in Yathrib, later called\nMedina, a trade city locat-\ned a few days to the north of\nMecca. Some individuals from\nMedina had traveled to Mecca\nin 620, where they heard the\nProphet preach and soon ad-\nopted Islam. Impressed by his\nFigure 8.4 | The Quba Mosque of Medina | The oldest mosque in Islam.\nreputation as an honest man,\nAuthor: User \u201cAbderlrhman 1990\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons the leaders of Medina invited\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 Muhammad to their city in 622\nto act as a mediator of tribal in-\nfighting over a shared oasis. As opposition in Mecca had become too intense for Muhammad and his\nfollowers to remain there, they migrated to Medina in 622, a seminal event known as the hijra that\nmarks the first year of the Islamic calendar. The Prophet rapidly converted many of the city\u2019s inhabi-\ntants to Islam. These new Muslims came to be identified as the ansar, meaning \u201chelpers.\u201d Together\nwith the muhajirun, the ansar helped the Prophet institutionalize the religion of Islam and develop\nan umma, or community of believers, that would dominate the social and political life of Medina.\nMuhammad assumed five different roles in Medina. First and foremost, he was the Prophet of\nIslam; therefore, he was the religious leader of the community. Second, he acted as the political leader\nof the umma. Because his followers agreed with him politically, they agreed with him religiously as\nwell. Third, Muhammad served as a judicial leader, using the Quran as the basis of law. Fourth, the\nProphet functioned as a legislator, working with the majlis, or council of elders, to enact laws. He\ntherefore governed his capital, Medina, with no separation of church and state. Finally, Muhammad\nwas a military leader who ensured that statehood would prevail for the Muslims.\nA major concern of Muhammad\u2019s leadership was to determine how the Muslims could con-\ntribute to the Medinan economy. He received a revelation during this period that suggested\nthe Muslims should raid the caravans coming north out of Mecca. (Qur\u2019an 22:39) In 624, the\nMedinans engaged a caravan of Meccans along a popular trade route bypassing Medina. In the\nensuing Battle of Badr, named after a nearby oasis, 300 Muslims defeated nearly 1000 Meccans\nand seized their caravan. They considered their signal victory a sign from God that he was on their\nside. Their success enhanced Muhammad\u2019s prestige and that of the Islamic community among the\nArab tribes in the peninsula.\nPage | 305 Unwilling to cede control of the lucrative caravan\ntrade to the upstart Muslims of Medina, the Umayyads\nconfronted the Muslims in 625 in the Battle of Uhud,\nwhich referred to a local mountain. Foot soldiers in\nthe vanguard of the Muslim forces led their defense.\nMeanwhile, a group of ambitious archers, ignoring the\nProphet\u2019s command to remain stationary, joined the\nbattle. Their imprudent action let the Meccan cavalry\nstrike the unprotected flank of Muhammad\u2019s warriors.\nThe Meccans failed to capitalize on their victory,\nhowever, and were unable to take Medina, a failure that\nleads some historians to consider the battle an ultimate\nsuccess for the Muslims.\nIn 627, the Umayyads of Mecca and the Muslims\nof Medina met in a final confrontation in what became\nknown as the Battle of the Trench, or khandaq in\nArabic; this battle ended in another triumph for the\nMuslims. In preparation for a foreseeable Umayyad Map 8.4 | Map of the Battle of Badr\nattack, a Persian engineer named Salman had suggested Author: User \u201cVedantm\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthat the Medinans build defensive works around the\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\ncity. So the Muslims survived the Meccan assault by\nentrenching themselves behind a near-impregnable\nbarrier. In 628, the Umayyads finally realized that they\nwere unable to vanquish the Muslims so sent a delega-\ntion of Meccans to sue for peace. The resulting Treaty\nof Hudaybiyyah symbolized their desire to extricate\nthemselves from a losing situation, as Mecca ultimately\ncompromised so their merchant elite would not lose any\nmore trade to the Medinans. The treaty provided for an\nofficial tolerance of Islam and for the Muslims to return\nto Mecca the following year, free from persecution.\nIn 630, two years before his death, the Prophet\nMuhammad advanced on the city of Mecca with an army\nof some 10,000 Muslims. Encountering only limited re-\nsistance, the army of Muslims took control of the city,\nan act that symbolized the idea of Islamic expansion.\nMuhammad cleansed the Ka\u2019ba of its purported 360\nreligious images and dedicated it to God. The prestige\nof the Muslims extended with their victory over the\nMap 8.5 | Map of the Battle of Uhud\nMeccans. As tribes learned of this triumph, they soon Author: User \u201cWarda99\u201d\nfollowed the lead of the winners, both politically and re- Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 1.0\nPage | 306 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nligiously, sending delegations to forge\nalliances with the Prophet. By the time\nthat Muhammad passed away, most\nof Arabia had converted to Islam.\nThe religion provided the Muslims of\nthe peninsula with a new \u2018asabiyah,\nor social solidarity, endowing the\nmovement with a unity of purpose.\nIn the absence of the Prophet,\nMuslim leaders had to develop a body\nof law to deal with important legal\nquestions. Over time, Sharia law\nbecame a legal system in which Islamic\nprinciples provided an accepted\nmeans to regulate all features of daily\nlife, including, but not limited to,\neconomics, politics, family life, and\nsociety. Sharia law is based on the Map 8.6 | Map of the Battle of the Trench\nAuthor: User \u201cBless sins\u201d\nQuran, Hadith, precedent, and in-\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nterpretation. In fact, the capacity for License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nvarious interpretations of the law has\nled to the development of several schools of Islamic jurisprudence.\n8.8 THE RASHIDUN CALIPHS\nMuhammad did not formally appoint a successor, or khalifa in Arabic, and no clear re-\nplacement arose to lead the Muslim community forward at the time of his death. In fact, the\numma divided into three groups, with each willing to appoint their own successor to the Prophet.\nEmerging as a vocal leader at this critical juncture, \u2018Umar, one of Muhammad\u2019s closest compan-\nions, convinced the majlis, or elders of the community, to elect Abu Bakr by consensus as a\ncompromise candidate. Abu Bakr had been Muhammad\u2019s closest friend; Muhammad\u2019s marriage\nof political alliance to \u2018A\u2019isha, Abu Bakr\u2019s daughter, further solidified their relationship.\nThe election of Abu Bakr (632 \u2013 634) brought much-needed stability and an almost democratic\nform of government to Islam. As caliph, Abu Bakr held together the converts to Islam by deploying\nthe forces at his disposal, thus cementing his authority among the Arabian tribes. He prevented\nany rebellious Muslim tribes from reverting to the worship of their traditional tribal gods, as they\nwere wont to do. Abu Bakr died in 634, two years after the Prophet Muhammad had died.\nThe majlis chose \u2018Umar (634 \u2013 644), a close friend of Abu Bakr, to be the next caliph. \u2018Umar\nhad been the military power behind Abu Bakr. A dynamic and uncompromising leader, \u2018Umar rec-\nognized the necessity of expansion northward to achieve various ends. First, he sought to subdue\nthe security threat of raiding nomads, many of which remained a law unto themselves. Second,\nPage | 307 in his struggle to contain discontent, he used the cohesive element of jihad to unite the Muslim\ncommunity against unbelievers and expand God\u2019s dominion. (The Arabic term of jihad actually\nrefers to a \u201cstruggle,\u201d usually against spiritual impurity, often known as \u201cgreater jihad,\u201d and is as-\nsociated with fulfilling God\u2019s objectives here on earth. The \u201clesser jihad,\u201d alternatively, is a physical\nstruggle against the unbelievers of the Dar al-Harb, or Abode of War, until it is absorbed into the\nDar al-Islam, or Abode of Islam, where believers were free to practice their faith as members of the\npredominant faith. Of note is the fact that Muhammad did not consider jihad important enough to\nmake one of the pillars of Islam.) Third, \u2018Umar understood the importance of plunder for the nascent\ncaliphate. Troops received four-fifths of the loot from conquest; the remainder of the revenue went\nto him to be dispersed amongst the neediest members in the Islamic community.\n\u2018Umar directed the full might of Islam northward against the Eastern Roman Empire, sometimes\nreferred to as the Byzantine\nEmpire. In 634, their first en-\ncounter took place in southern\nPalestine. The ensuing Battle\nof Ajnadayn was a decisive\nvictory for the Muslims and\na major loss for Emperor\nHeraclius. Two years later, an\noutnumbered Muslim army\ndefeated the Eastern Roman\nEmpire yet again at the Battle\nof Yarmouk, located on\nthe eponymous river, some-\nwhere between Damascus and\nJerusalem. In both instances,\nthe Byzantines relied on their\nslow, heavy cavalry, whereas\nthe Arabs capitalized on their\nlight armor and their supe-\nrior mobility. The Muslims\nrealized that they could not\njust charge the East Roman\nlines; they showed their tac-\ntical superiority by flanking\nthe Byzantines and executing\na successful rearguard ac-\ntion instead. These victories\nopened up greater Syria to Map 8.7 | Map of Muslim and Byzantine Troop Movements, 635-636 CE\nAuthor: User \u201cMagnus Manske\u201d\nMuslim conquest. Antioch,\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nAleppo, and Jerusalem fell to License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 308 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nthe Muslims not long thereafter. \u2018Umar appointed Mu\u2018awiya, a member of the Meccan Umayyad\naristocracy to govern Syria at his behest.\nOnce he dealt with the increasingly vulnerable Byzantines in the Levant, \u2018Umar directed his army\nto the east against the Sasanian Empire of Persia. In 636, fighting along the banks of the Euphrates\nRiver, a smaller Arab force triumphed over the Persians, at the Battle of Qadisiya. After succes-\nsive days of exhaustive combat, the Muslims took advantage of environmental conditions and their\nlight cavalry\u2019s mobility when they chased a dust storm and took the Sasanids by surprise.\nTo save their empire, the Persians mounted a failed counterattack. In 642, Umar\u2019s army even-\ntually defeated the forces of the Sasanian Emperor Yazdagird III at the Battle of Nahavand, situated\ndeep in Iran\u2019s Zagros Mountains. Yazdagird fled to the east as a fugitive, and, in 651, met his death\nat the hands of a local miller who killed the emperor in order to rob him of his belongings.\nIn 639, General \u2018Amr petitioned \u2018Umar for permission to invade Egypt and eventually persuaded\nthe caliph that he could easily take Egypt so gained his reluctant consent. In 641, he received a\nmessage from \u2018Umar recalling his forces. The general ignored the order and seized Egypt with just a\nfew hundred soldiers. With promises of toleration, \u2018Amr convinced the Egyptian Coptic majority to\nMap 8.8 | Map of the Muslim Conquest of Egypt, 639-641 CE\nAuthor: User \u201cMagnus Manske\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 309 side with him against the Greek Orthodox ruling minority, whose Patriarch Cyrus had been actively\npersecuting the Copts as followers of a Christian heresy that failed to recognize the Holy Trinity.\nClearly outnumbered Muslim armies thus successfully defeated two long-standing empires\nin the span of just a few decades. Several explanations help us understand the rapid expansion of\nIslam during this period. One concept, termed the vacuum theory, posits that the Byzantine and\nPersian empires had been severely weakened from near-continuous fighting, dating back decades\nprior to the rise of Islam, so they both suffered from the fatigue of war. Islam, therefore, occupied\nthe vacuum of political power resulting from the collapse of these two exhausted empires.\nThe success of Muslim military strategy offers a second explanation. While Byzantine forces\nadopted a defensive stance on the battlefield, the Arabs employed more aggressive tactics, making\nuse of their mobile light cavalry against their enemies\u2019 heavily armored armies. Once victorious,\nthe Arabs populated garrison cities on the frontier, called amsar, with Muslims. These military\nsettlements provided security, served as logistical loci, and discouraged Muslim troops from\nmingling with the locals. The caliphs thereby prevented their warriors being assimilated into the\ncommunities of the conquered while also preventing soldiers from disturbing the peace. Fustat in\nEgypt, as well as Kufa and Basra in Iraq, were the largest of the amsar. From bases like these, the\nArabs could expand and consolidate their hold over the frontier.\nReligion also provided an impetus for the expansion of Islam. Fearing that internal tribal\ndivisions threatened the early Islamic state, \u2018Umar united the Muslims through their common\nIslamic theology and faced them against a common enemy. Dedicated to the expansion of Islam,\nMuslims used the concept of jihad as a way to unify the umma, or Islamic community, against a\nforeign foe. Faith motivated the troops, who were zealous and determined to fight.\nSimple economics also served as a primary motivating factor in the expansion of Islam. For\none, Muslim rulers applied the jizya, an annual tax levied on non-Muslims, to newly-conquered\nlands. The money derived from conquest functioned as a driving force in the growth of the\ncaliphate. With the expectation of material reward, soldiers could earn money for their service.\nWhile the practice of dividing the spoils of war amongst the soldiers continued under \u2018Umar, he\nalso started offering salaries to his troops, determining salaries according to the length of service.\nThe Muslims further exploited the internal divisions of targeted societies, as exempli-\nfied in Egypt, where the Coptic Christian majority, together with a large Jewish minority in\nAlexandria, had suffered under the rule of an oppressive Greek Orthodox Christian minority\nbut gained autonomy and toleration within an Islamic state. And in Syria, another mono-\nphysite Christian minority called the Syrian Orthodox Church, or Jacobites, collaborated\nwith the Muslims and hastened the collapse of the Byzantines. All these factors led the early\nIslamic state to expand exponentially.\nIn 644, an Iranian captive from the Persian campaign stabbed \u2018Umar to death. His successor,\n\u2018Uthman (644 \u2013 656), was an elderly man from the Umayyad Clan who won a contentious\nelection over \u2018Ali. \u2018Ali possessed all of the \u2018Alid bona fides. \u2018Ali was not only son of Muhammad\u2019s\nearly protector, Abu Thalib; he was also the Prophet\u2019s cousin and son-in-law. He had married\nMuhammad\u2019s daughter Fatima; together, they had two sons, Hasan and Husayn. \u2018Ali had also\nearned a well-deserved reputation as a virtuous Muslim. One of the first converts to Islam, he had\nPage | 310 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nFigure 8.5 | Family Tree of the Prophet Muhammad\nAuthor: User \u201cBasilio\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 311 journeyed with Muhammad on most of his expeditions and fought against the Meccans. Finally,\n\u2018Ali also served as a valued advisor to the early caliphs on questions of dogma.\nTwo factions formed in the wake of questions over \u2018Uthman\u2019s succession, thus initiating the\ndevelopment of a division within Islam. One faction was a group of \u2018Alids who believed that \u2018Ali\nshould inherit the mantle of Islam and referred to traditions suggesting that Muhammad had pro-\nclaimed to the faithful that \u2018Ali should be his successor. The amsar followed the \u2018Alids and later\nadopted the Shi\u2018a appellation. The other faction, the Umayyads contended that the method of\nappointing successors should be by consensus, as was done with the first caliphs. Mostly based in\nMecca, they later identified as Sunnis. Over time, these factional differences became increasingly\ndifficult to bridge.\nAlthough \u2018Uthman, one of the Prophet\u2019s first converts, was a pious Muslim, he was a corrupt ad-\nministrator. He displayed nepotistic tendencies that gave precedence to the Meccan elite, a practice\nthat diverged from \u2018Umar\u2019s policies of favoring soldiers who had been the first to respond to the\ncall to action. \u2018Umar\u2019s beneficiaries had usually originated from lesser tribes, those too weak to\nconstitute a coherent threat to the establishment; by contrast, \u2018Uthman\u2019s appointees were members\nof the Meccan elite who generally pursued policies benefiting the Umayyad merchants of Mecca.\nGovernment also began to disintegrate under \u2018Uthman\u2019s rule, as opposition and instability\nplagued his tenure as caliph. He managed to offend three separate groups of Muslims. The first\nof these were the older, pious Muslims, who hailed from Medina. They resented how the hated\nUmayyads had taken over the same umma that they had previously persecuted and had once\ntried to destroy. Second were the Quran reciters. When \u2018Uthman commissioned and authorized\na single official version of the holy text, an act for which he received many accolades, the Quran\nreciters lost the opportunity for gainful employment. Third were a disgruntled contingent of \u2018Alids\nwho called for \u2018Uthman to resign and advocated the election of \u2018Ali. Their discontent culminated\nin 656, when resentful devotees of \u2018Ali from Egypt broke into \u2018Uthman\u2019s home in Medina and\nassassinated him, purportedly while he was reading the Quran. They then hastily arranged for the\nelection of \u2018Ali as \u2018Uthman\u2019s successor.\nThrice rejected by the majlis in favor of the first three caliphs, \u2018Ali (656 \u2013 661) reluctantly\naccepted the position of leader of the Islamic community. His selection represented a victory for\nthe faction of legitimists disappointed in the earlier choice of \u2018Uthman. \u2018Ali assumed the role of\ncaliph amid high expectations, for he was a pious and generous man. Yet the caliphate suffered\nunder his rule. During this time of instability, he constantly had to suppress revolts. For example,\ntensions between the supporters of \u2018Ali and the family of \u2018Uthman eventually erupted into the first\ncivil war in Islam. In 656, at the Battle of the Camel, \u2018Ali engaged the combined forces of the\nProphet\u2019s favored wife, \u2018A\u2019isha, and her associates, Talha and Zubayr, who were both relatives\nof \u2018Uthman. Because \u2018Ali had failed to bring the dead caliph\u2019s assassins to justice; these three\ntogether demanded satisfaction for his death.\nThe conspirators challenged \u2018Ali near the garrison city of Basra, in southern Iraq, before\nhe had the chance to move the caliphate from Medina to the sympathetic military settlement\nof Kufa. A first, diplomacy seemed to prevail, as \u2018Ali sought to avoid bloodshed by negotiating.\nHe succeeded in convincing the three to lay down their arms; however, a group later known as\nPage | 312 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nKharijis conspired to undermine their\nreconciliation and set fire to the tents\nin both camps in the dead of the night.\nPandemonium ensued. Because of this\nsingle impetuous action, both parties\nthought the other side had flouted the\nagreement, committing a violation of\ntrust. During the ensuing battle, \u2018A\u2019isha\nwas pushed into the middle of the fray\non the back of a camel, as was Arab\ncustom. The supporters who rallied to\nher side were cut down, and \u2018Ali emerged\nvictorious from a very bloody battle. The\nrepercussions of his victory reverberated\nacross the Islamic world, as older Muslim\nmen castigated \u2018A\u2019isha for her part in\nthe conflict and suggested that women\nshould not play a role in public life.\nThis threat was not the only one\n\u2018Ali faced, for he also had to contend\nwith Mu\u2018awiya, \u2018Uthman\u2019s cousin and\nformer governor of Syria. Conspicuously\nabsent from \u2018Ali\u2019s new administration,\nFigure 8.6 | \u2018Ali and \u2018A\u2019isha at the Battle of the Camel\nMu\u2018awiya refused to pay homage to \u2018Ali\nAuthor: Unknown\nSource: Wikimedia Commons and asserted his own independence in\nLicense: Public Domain Syria. He also echoed the accusations of\n\u2018A\u2019isha, Talha, and Zubayr, as members\nof Mu\u2018awiya\u2019s Umayyad Clan had expressed dismay about the quick election of \u2018Ali, and questions\nstill lingered over the new caliph\u2019s part in \u2018Uthman\u2019s death. \u2018Ali\u2019s failure to act against \u2018Uthman\u2019s\nassassins proved his culpability, Mu\u2018awiya and the Umayyads, and Mu\u2018awiya asserted the tradi-\ntional Arab custom of exacting revenge on one\u2019s enemies.\nHis conflict with \u2018Ali culminated in 657 when they met at the Battle of Siffin, on the Euphrates\nRiver in northern Syria. After months of clashes, \u2018Ali agreed to arbitration with Mu\u2018awiya. Still\npreferring negotiation over bloodshed, \u2018Ali had been of the opinion that Muslims should never\ntake up arms against fellow Muslims. His willingness to negotiate with Mu\u2018awiya, however, caused\nsome of Ali\u2019s own soldiers to defect and adopt the appellation of Kharijis, from kharaja, meaning\n\u201cto depart.\u201d The first sect in Islam, they departed from Ali because they believed that \u201cjudgement\nbelongs to God alone\u201d (Quran 6:57); they saw \u2018Ali\u2019s willingness to negotiate with Mu\u2018awiya as\nsomehow reducing the role of God in determining a successor. In lieu of arbitration, they thought\nthat God would determine the rightful successor by influencing the outcome on the field of battle.\nPage | 313 Figure 8.7 | Battle of Siffin, from Balami\u2019s Tarikhnama\nAuthor: Bal\u2019ami\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\n8.9 THE UMAYYAD CALIPHATE\nIn 661, \u2018Ali suffered the same fate as his predecessor when a Khariji stabbed him to death.\nAnd, just like with \u2018Uthman, the murder of \u2018Ali took place during prayers. \u2018Ali\u2019s death represented\na deep loss for his followers, who saw him as an advocate of an egalitarian version of Islam and a\nbeliever in a just and righteous government. His martyrdom came to be regarded as a sacrifice in\nthe service of God and prompted his supporters to pattern themselves after their champion, who,\nthey insisted, had developed spiritual gifts that remained virtually unattainable for others.\nThe \u2018Alids encouraged \u2018Ali\u2019s oldest son, Hasan, to succeed his father; however, Mu\u2018awiya\nthreatened the Prophet\u2019s grandson with continued warfare and convinced him to renounce his\nclaim to the caliphate. Mu\u2018awiya promised Hasan that he would not appoint an heir so that\nelection of future caliphs would return to the majlis. Handsomely compensated by Mu\u2018awiya,\nHassan subsequently retired to Mecca and took up religion. He remained there until his death in\nPage | 314 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nMap 8.9 | Map of The Umayyad Caliphate at its Greatest Extent\nAuthor: User \u201cGabagool\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n669. With this major obstacle removed, Mu\u2018awiya became the fifth caliph, ending the period of the\nfour rightly guided caliphs, also known as the Rashidun Caliphate.\nMu\u2018awiya (661 \u2013 680) founded the Umayyad Caliphate; the tribal \u2018asabiyah of his Umayyad\nClan contributed to their ascendance. And once ensconced in power, the Umayyad Caliphate\nended the election of caliphs by consensus and established instead a hereditary principle of suc-\ncession. Mu\u2018awiya established the caliphate to Damascus, where he previously served as \u2018Uthman\u2019s\ngovernor. In Syria, Mu\u2018awiya reformed the bureaucracy by eventually centralizing it. Unable to rely\non the Arab tribal system or peninsula traditions to administer to an ever expanding empire, he\ndepended on related Greek merchant families for administrators and adopted the existing admin-\nistrative machinery of Byzantines, including their imperial customs and bureaucratic practices.\nMu\u2018awiya had received much recognition for his unfaltering determination to seek retribution\nfor \u2018Uthman\u2019s death; however, he had squandered much of that good will in harassing \u2018Ali. As\nanti-Umayyad sentiment increased, the rift that existed between the Sunnis and Shi\u2018a continued\nto expand, for recalcitrant \u2018Alids continued to harbor resentment against the Umayyads. They\nremembered when the ruling aristocracy of Mecca had opposed Muhammad and the Muslim\ncommunity. In fact, Mu\u2018awiya himself had fought against Muhammad until the Treaty of\nHudaybiyyah, only to reverse course, convert to Islam, and become the Prophet\u2019s secretary.\nPage | 315 Unlike the two caliphs who preceded him,\nMu\u2018awiya died peacefully in bed. Prior to his\ndeath, he designated his son Yazid (680 \u2013 683)\nas his successor, thus violating his agreement\nwith Hasan. Most notable for his well-deserved\nreputation as a fierce fighter, Yazid was also\nknown for generally dissolute behavior that\noffended the religious sensibilities of many pious\nMuslims. Once ensconced as caliph, Yazid failed\nto secure an oath of allegiance from Husayn,\nbrother of Hasan, one of the most important of\nMuslim leaders. Their rivalry escalated into a\nfull-scale civil war.\nA direct descendent of the Prophet\nMuhammad and the younger son of the Caliph\n\u2018Ali, Husayn rejected the deal that his brother\nhad negotiated, instead pursuing his own claim to\nthe rightful leadership of the Islamic community.\nHis \u2018Alid supporters loathed the Umayyads and\nbelieved that the caliph must be closely related to\nthe Prophet. Husayn\u2019s refusal to recognize Yazid\nas the next caliph and their subsequent conflict\nFigure 8.8 | Hasan fought at the Battle of culminated in 680 at the Battle of Karbala, located\nSiffin, from Bal\u2019ami\u2019s Tarikhnama\nto the west of present day Baghdad.

The Shi\u2018a perceived this seminal event as a turning point in their history.\nMuch like the loss of \u2018Ali, the death of Husayn shocked the incipient Shi\u2018a community, many of\nwhom suffered from intense guilt for failing to assist his little band. Increasing numbers of Shi\u2018a\nbecame profoundly affected by his martyrdom, interpreting it as a sacrifice in the best interests\nof their community; over time, a passion narrative developed that commemorated his last hours.\nThrough this commemoration of the Battle of Karbala on Ashura, the tenth day of the month of\nMuharram, they remember the terrible suffering and his untimely death and strive to experience\nan existential intimacy with their martyr.\nYazid had inherited an empire punctuated by civil war and rebellion. Another principle figure\namong those in revolt was ibn Zubayr, grandson of Caliph Abu Bakr. Following the death of\nMu\u2018awiya, Ibn Zubayr had sworn allegiance to Husayn. He remained in Mecca, where he stood in op-\nposition to the Umayyads. The general unpopularity of the Umayyads advanced his cause, and many\nMuslims considered him the rightful caliph. Indeed, much of his support came from Muslims who\nrejected the idea of hereditary succession and sought a return to the election of caliphs by consensus.\nPage | 316 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nFigure 8.9 | Artistic commemoration of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn at the Battle of Karbala | The focus\nof the painting is on Husayn\u2019s half-brother \u2018Abbas on a white horse.\nAuthor: Abbas Al-Musavo\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nYazid invaded the Hijaz in order to put an end to ibn Zubayr\u2019s rebellion, but the caliph\u2019s abrupt\ndeath in 683 halted the campaign. Marwan (684 \u2013 685) followed his cousin Yazid but was not\nuniversally recognized as caliph, for many considered ibn Zubayr the legitimate successor. To\ngarner support, Marwan exploited\nlatent tribal animosities that existed\nbetween his Kalb Tribe, also known\nas the Yemen, and the Qays Tribe,\nwho supported ibn Zubayr. At the\nBattle of Marj Rahit in 684,\nMarwan\u2019s Kalb forces defeated the\nQays, allowing him to consolidate\nUmayyad control over Syria and\nEgypt, thus shrinking ibn Zubayr\u2019s\nrule down to Iraq and the Hijaz. Not\nuntil 691 did Abdul Malik (685 \u2013\n705), heir to Marwan, recover Iraq\nfrom ibn Zubayr. In the process, he\nFigure 8.10 | The Mourning of Muharram in Iran\nalso had to pacify Khariji and Shi\u2018a Author: Payam Moein\nareas.

A brutal military\nleader, Hajjaj laid siege to the holy city of\nMecca in 692 in order to secure the submis-\nsion of ibn Zubayr\u2019s men. He then beheaded\nibn Zubayr and crucified his body. Abdul\nMalik rewarded the brutal general for his\nloyal service with the governorship of Iraq,\nwhere his ruthless reputation persisted.\nOnce he had assumed the throne,\nAbdul Malik promoted the Arabization of\nthe caliphate. He rejected the use of Greek,\nPersian, Coptic, or Aramaic in govern-\nment, decreeing that all bureaucracy had\nto be only in Arabic. Non-Arab adminis-\ntrators had to learn Arabic in order to keep\ntheir government jobs. Their integration\ndid not lead to the complete Arabization\nFigure 8.11 | Abdul Malik on One of the New Coins\nof Umayyad society that Abdul Malik envi-\nAuthor: World Imaging\nsioned, however, and the spread of Arabic Source: Wikimedia Commons\nwas not as great as the spread of Islam. License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nMany Muslims continued to speak Berber, Turkish,\nKurdish, and Persian. Although a separate process,\nArabization only accompanied Islamization.\nAbdul Malik also sought to Islamize the caliphate.\nFirst, he discontinued the earlier Byzantine coinage\nand created the first Islamic currency. Then he institut-\ned a tax code based on the principles of Islam. Caliphs\nlevied an additional tax on non-Muslims, known as\nthe jizya, as was customary in Islam. Christians and\nJews in conquered lands also paid a property tax called\nkharaj. By converting to Islam, one could avoid paying\nthe jizya and kharaj altogether. Most important for\nordinary citizens was the fact that Muslims bore lower\ntax rates than non-Muslims. As one could imagine,\nthe thrust for conversion became primarily economic.\nAlthough the process of Islamization was relatively\npeaceful and gradual, Islam did become the dominant\nFigure 8.12 | Early Ottoman Jizya Document religion of the region. And the parallel processes of\nAuthor: World Imaging\nArabization and Islamization helped to reestablish\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 centralized rule after the second civil war.\nPage | 318 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nNot all of Abdul Malik\u2019s reforms adhered to the egalitarian principles set forth in Islam. Arab\ntribal elites did not want to recognize the mawali, non-Arab Muslims, as social equals, so did\nnot afford them the same rights as Arab Muslims. However, the emerging power and influence\nof the mawali was apparent. They had become the intellectual elite of society and were the bu-\nreaucrats and commercial leaders of the umma. Nevertheless, they faced social discrimination.\nFor example, Umayyad caliphs taxed the mawali as if they were non-Muslims. This inequitable\npractice became a social problem for the Umayyads, for it stood in stark relief against the values\nof justice and equality that had originally compelled them to convert.\nAn extremely devout and pious man, the Caliph \u2018Umar II (r. 717 \u2013 720) upended the Umayyad\nmoral order. He considered it immoral to show prejudice against the mawali and to favor the\nArabs, so he attempted to resolve the lingering hostilities of the mawali by advocating the equality\nof all Muslims. \u2018Umar II declared an end to the practice of taxing the mawali like the Christians\nand Jews. His advisors warned him against this change because it precipitated numerous conver-\nsions of non-Muslims, so he decreased military expenditures to compensate for an expected drop\nin revenue. His reforms might have ended the official discrimination against the mawali, but they\nalienated the Umayyad privileged class, who paid a servant to poison \u2018Umar II to death in 720.\n8.10 THE \u2018ABBASID CALIPHATE\nFor many Muslims, \u2018Umar II\u2019s reforms had come too late. The Umayyads had already managed\nto alienate three important groups of Muslims, Kharijis, the mawali, and the Shi\u2018a, whose combined\npower and influence were coopted by the \u2018Abbasids and threatened the internal security of the\ncaliphate. Kharijis eschewed disputes over lineage and advocated a more egalitarian brand of Islam\nthan the Sunni Umayyads. They believed that any Muslim could be the rightful heir to the mantle\nof the Prophet, so long as that\nperson rigorously adhered to\nthe examples set forth in the\nSunna. Kharijis thought that\ncaliphs who diverged from\nthe Prophet\u2019s example should\nbe overthrown, as evidenced\nby their assassination of the\nCaliph \u2018Ali. Second, Umayyad\nauthorities had enacted\npunitive measures against the\nmawali, mostly Persians, but\nalso Kurds and Turks. They\ntreated them like second-class\ncitizens, no different than the Map 8.10 | The \u2018Abbasid Caliphate at its Greatest Extent, c. 850 CE\nAuthor: User \u201cGabagool\u201d\nPeople of the Book. Finally, it\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nangered most of the Shi\u2018a that License: CC BY 3.0\nPage | 319 Figure 8.13 | Abu al-\u2018Abbas al-Saffah is proclaimed the first \u2018Abbasid Caliph, from Balami\u2019s Tarikhnama\nAuthor: Bal\u2019ami\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nthe Umayyads could not trace their ancestry to the Prophet Muhammad. They also blamed the\nUmayyads for the death of their martyr Husayn. The \u2018Abbasids collaborated with these disaffected\ngroups to incite unrest and rebellion. They particularly cultivated Shi\u2018a anti-Umayyad sentiment,\nemphasizing their own connection to the Prophet; indeed, the \u2018Abbasids traced their ancestry to\nMuhammad\u2019s uncle \u2018Abbas and the Hashimite Clan. They also vaguely promised to adopt Shi\u2018a\nIslam once in power. Together, these three groups formed a constituency that campaigned on\nbehalf of the \u2018Abbasids.\nA secretive family, \u2018Abbasids bided their time until the opportune moment to rebel against the\nUmayyad Caliphate. In 743, the \u2018Abbasids began their revolution in remote Khorasan, a region in\neastern Persia, just as the Umayyads were contending with not only revolts but also the inoppor-\ntune death of the Caliph Hisham. In that moment of Umayyad disorder, the \u2018Abbasids dispatched\nAbu Muslim, a Persian general, to Khorasan to start the revolution. Abu Muslim\u2019s early victories\nagainst the Umayyads allowed Abu al-\u2018Abbas, leader of the \u2018Abbasid dynasty, to enter the sym-\npathetic city of Kufa in 748. Together, Abu Muslim and Abu al-\u2018Abbas, who adopted the honorific\nof as-Saffah, or \u201cthe generous,\u201d confronted the Umayyad Caliph Marwan II in 750, at the Battle of\nthe Zab, in modern day Iraq. Sensing defeat, Marwan II fled, but his pursuers eventually caught\nand killed him in Egypt. As-Saffah captured the Umayyad capital of Damascus shortly thereafter.\nThe \u2018Abbasids attempted to eliminate the entire house of the Umayyads so that not one remained\nPage | 320 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nto come forth and rise up against them, but one, \u2018Abd al-Rahman, escaped eminent death and fled\nto Egypt. The only member of the family to abscond from certain demise, \u2018Abd al-Rahman fled\nacross North Africa to Spain, where he recreated a Spanish Muslim dynasty in a parallel fashion\nto the Umayyad dynasty in Syria. Under the Umayyads, Spain became the wealthiest and most\ndeveloped part of Europe (see Chapter Seven). In fact, it was through Islamic Spain that ancient\nGreek learning entered Europe.\nThe change from the Umayyad\u2019s Arab tribal aristocracy to a more egalitarian government, one\nbased on the doctrines of Islam, under the \u2018Abbasids, corresponds to Ibn Khaldun\u2019s Cyclical Theory\nof History. The \u2018Abbasids officially advocated Sunni orthodoxy and severed their relationship of\nconvenience with the Shi\u2018a. They even went so far as to assassinate many Shi\u2018a leaders, whom\nthey regarded as potential threats to their rule. To escape \u2018Abbasid persecution and find safety\nand security, many Shi\u2018a scattered to the edges of the empire. While the Shi\u2018a might have been\ndisappointed with the \u2018Abbasids for refusing to advocate Shi\u2018a Islam, most Muslims welcomed the\n\u2018Abbasid\u2019s arrival. They had justified their revolt against the corrupt Umayyads because the latter\nhad digressed from the core principles of Islam. As standard bearers of the Prophet\u2019s own family,\nthe \u2018Abbasids were publicly pious, even digging wells and providing protection along hajj routes.\nCaliph al-Mansur (754 \u2013 775) abandoned the Umayyad capital of Damascus and moved the\ncaliphate close to the old Persian capital of Ctesiphon. Construction of the new city of Baghdad\nbegan in 762. Situated at the confluence of the Tigris and Diyala rivers, it boasted a prime location\nthat provided access to the sea with enough distance from the coast to offer safety from pirates.\nModeled after circular Persian cities, Baghdad rapidly escaped its confines and expanded into\nits environs. Quickly eclipsing Chang\u2019an, it became the largest city in the world, with over half a\nmillion inhabitants. In effect, Baghdad became a public works project, employing 100,000 citizens\nand stimulating the economy. Al-Mansur\u2019s newly-founded city proudly displayed lavish \u2018Abbasid\nfamily residences and grandiose public buildings. It even had working sewers, which dumped raw\nsewage into the nearby canals and rivers.\nProminently featured in One Thousand and One Nights, Harun al-Rashid (789 \u2013 809)\nrepresented the climax of \u2018Abbasid rulers; as such, he improved upon the work his predecessors\nhad begun. For example, Harun furthered Baghdad\u2019s development into a major economic center\nby encouraging trade along the Silk Road and through the waters of the Indian Ocean. He also\nmade marginal agricultural land more productive, taking advantage of technological advances\nin irrigation to cultivate borrowed crops like rice, cotton, and sugar from India, as well as citrus\nfruits from China.\nHarun al-Rashid\u2019s reign coincided with the so-called Golden Age of Islam when Baghdad\ndeveloped into a preeminent city of scholarship. He began construction of the Bayt al-Hikmah\n(House of Wisdom), the foremost intellectual center in the Islamic world. The complex boasted\nof several schools, astronomical observatories, and even a giant library, where scholars translated\nscientific and philosophical works from neighboring civilizations, including works from Persian,\nHindi, Chinese, and Greek.\nAs a result of this move from Damascus to Baghdad, Persia increasingly influenced the Islamic\nworld, with a synthesis of Arab and Persian culture beginning under the \u2018Abbasids. For instance,\nPage | 321 Map 8.11 | Map of Baghdad between 767 and 912 CE\nAuthor: William Muir\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY 3.0\nthe Persian Sibawayah (d. c. 793) responded to the need for non-Arab Muslims to understand the\nQuran by systematizing the first Arabic grammar, titled al-Kitab. The greatest poet of the period,\nAbu Nuwas (d. c. 813), was of mixed parentage, Arab and Iranian. The avant-garde themes of\nhis poems often emphasized dissolute behavior. Although ibn Ishaq (d.768), a historian of sorts,\nwas born in Medina, he relocated to Baghdad, where he too came under the influence of Persian\nculture. At the behest of Caliph al-Mansur, he composed the first authoritative biography of the\nProphet Muhammad. Another important Persian scholar, al-Tabari (d. 923) wrote the History of\nProphets and Kings, a great resource on early Islamic history.\nInheritors of Sasanian court traditions that emphasized ceremony, the \u2018Abbasids slowly\ndistanced themselves from their subjects. The harem embodied this spatial separation. A\nforbidden place, the caliph\u2019s family made the harem their personal residence. Caliphs controlled\nthe empire through family, solidifying political alliances by marrying many powerful women.\nPage | 322 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nThe harem bestowed power to\nwomen, and they played an\nimportant role in influencing\n\u2018Abbasid politics, particularly in\nterms of questions over succes-\nsion. In the late \u2018Abbasid period,\nvarious women selected and\ntrained the successors. Young\nmen who were to rule resided in\nthe harem, and much scheming\nover which son the caliph\npreferred occurred there. The\nFigure 8.14 | John the Grammarian as Ambassador Before mother of the caliph, however,\nTheophilos and Mamun | The Embassy of John the Grammarian in dominated internal politics\n829, between the Byzantine emperor Theophilos on the right and the\nof the space. Harun\u2019s mother\nAbbasid caliph al-Ma\u2019mun on the left.\nAuthor: Unknown played a significant role in his\nSource: Wikimedia Commons reign, for example. The second\nLicense: Public Domain\nmost powerful woman in the\nhousehold was the mother of\nthe heir apparent. She could be any woman, even a concubine, for young, beautiful women were\nhighly sought after at a time when the harem became more important under the \u2018Abbasids.\nRiven apart by palace intrigue, the \u2018Abbasid Caliphate eventually succumbed to internecine\nwarfare. In fact, Harun al-Rashid himself divided the caliphate when he designated his eldest\nson, al-Amin, as his heir, for he had already bequeathed the province of Khorasan to his younger\nson, al-Ma\u2019mun. Upon their father\u2019s death in 809, al-Amin demanded his brother\u2019s territory\nand obeisance. Of course, al-Ma\u2019mun refused, and a catastrophic civil war ensued. In 812, al-\nMa\u2019mun\u2019s army, under the command of his Persian general, Tahir, laid siege to Baghdad. Tahir\ncaught al-Amin attempting to escape from the city and decapitated him. Al-Ma\u2019mun succeeded his\nbrother as caliph, but remained in Merv, his former capital. He ultimately relocated to Baghdad\nin 819, by which time, years of sporadic violence and lawlessness had severely damaged the city.\nAl-Ma\u2019mun (r.813 \u2013 833) continued his father\u2019s tradition of sponsoring scholarship. He\ncompleted the Bayt al-Hikmah that his father had begun. He also expressed a love for philo-\nsophical and theological debate and encouraged the Islamic doctrine known as the Mu\u2018tazila, a\nrationalist formulation of Islam that stressed free will over divine predestination. Influenced by\nAristotelian thought, the Mu\u2018tazila attempted to solve the theological question of evil. It asserted\nthat human reason alone could inform proper behavior. Condemned as a heresy for incorporat-\ning extra Islamic patterns of thought into their belief system, many Muslims concluded that the\nMu\u2018tazila\u2019s rationalism exceeded the holy doctrines of Islam.\nThe \u2018Abbasids began their long, slow decline under al-Ma\u2019mun, who was the first caliph to\nconfer greater freedom upon his emirs, or provincial governors, initiating a process of decen-\ntralization that eventually unleashed uncontrollable centrifugal forces. This process began when\nPage | 323 al-Ma\u2019mun first awarded his general Tahir with the governorship of Khorasan, where Tahir raised\nhis own revenue and directed his own affairs. The Tahirid dynasty dominated the politics of the\nregion, resisting Abbasid attempts to restrain them. From Khorasan, Tahir\u2019s family represented\nan existential threat to the caliphate.\nInternal problems continued under al-Mu\u2018tasim (833 \u2013 842), the successor to al-Ma\u2019mun,\nwho replaced undependable tribal armies with mamluks. The mamluks played an increasingly\nimportant role in the fate of the caliphate. They were part of an elite slave system that imported\nyoung boys from various backgrounds, though usually Turkic, and trained them in the military\narts. Because the enslavement of Muslims was not permitted in Islam, caliphs obtained slaves by\nraiding outside of the Islamic world or by trading for them. Indoctrinated at a young age, mamluks\nremained loyal to their leaders, serving as their personal bodyguard. Once emancipated, however,\nthey entered into a contractual relationship with their former masters and benefited from certain\nproperty and marriage rights. Although often portrayed as slaves in the popular imagination,\nmamluks actually formed a proud caste of soldiers who considered themselves superior to the\nrest of society. As the elite bodyguards\nto the caliph, they supplanted the tradi-\ntional ethnic hierarchy of the \u2018Abbasids,\na shift which led to much class conflict\noften resulting in unrest and civil distur-\nbances. In order to remove the mamluks\nfrom the volatile situation in Baghdad,\nthe caliph moved the capital to Samarra,\nsome 60 miles to the north, a measure\nthat only delayed the inevitable, as subse-\nquent caliphs could not control the rising\ntensions that resulted in social instability\nand contributed to the decentralization\nand fragmentation of the empire.\nThe transition from tribal armies to\nmamluks had profound repercussions\nfor the \u2018Abbasids. Mamluks like Ahmad\nibn Tulun (835 \u2013 884), a slave from\nCircassia, most exemplified this pattern\nof decentralization and fragmentation\nthat had disastrous consequences for the\n\u2018Abbasid Caliphate. He had been sent by\nthe \u2018Abbasids to Egypt in order to restruc-\nture and strengthen it on their behalf.\nAn intellectual and religious person, ibn Figure 8.15 | Mamluk Lancers on Horseback\nAuthor: Nick Michael\nTulun founded schools, hospitals, and\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nmosques in Egypt, the most famous being License: Public Domain\nPage | 324 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nthe eponymous ibn Tulun Mosque. However, he saw weakness back in Baghdad, as the \u2018Abbasids\nsuffered from instability, including palace intrigue, disorderly mamluks, and revolts like the\nZanj Rebellion, a slave rebellion that threatened the fate of the caliphate. The \u2018Abbasids could\nnot control ibn Tulun, and, as the caliphate broke down, he managed to secure almost complete\nautonomy from Baghdad. By the end of his reign, he was so independent that he kept his own tax\nrevenue and raised his own mamluk army, for he, too, depended militarily and politically on his\nloyal mamluks to stay in power.\nFigure 8.16 | The Ibn Tulun Mosque, Cairo, Egypt\nAuthor: Berthol Werner\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nIbn Tulun\u2019s autonomy in Egypt portended the decline of the \u2018Abbasids, whose real authority\ncame to an end in 945. The Buyids, an Iranian dynasty, overthrew the \u2018Abbasids and relegated\nthem to the status of mere religious figureheads; the caliphate continued in name only. Following\nthe collapse of the Abbasids, the centralization and political unity of the lands formerly under\ntheir control broke down; however, economic, cultural, and religious unity remained.\n8.11 THE FATIMID CALIPHATE\nWhile Egypt grew increasingly independent of Baghdad under the Tulunids, the rule of the\n\u2018Abbasids over their broad empire generally declined. From this vacuum of power, the Fatimids (910\n\u2013 1171) emerged. Members of the Isma\u2018ili sect of Shi\u2018a Islam, the Fatimids traced their genealogy\nPage | 325 to the relationship between Fatima,\nthe Prophet\u2019s daughter, and \u2018Ali.\nIsma\u2018ilis believe that the divinely\nordained spiritual leadership of the\nIslamic community, or caliphate,\ndescended from \u2018Ali down to\nIsma\u2018il, the son of Jafar al-Sadiq.\nThey refused to recognize the legiti-\nmacy of the \u2018Abbasids and sought to\nconvert the masses of Sunnis to their\nown schismatic brand of Islam. To\ndo so, Isma\u2018ili missionaries spread\nout to the far flung fringes of the\nMap 8.12 | Map of the Fatimid Caliphate, 969 CE\nempire and preached a religious rev- Author: User \u201cGabagool\u201d\nolution.

Hounded by\n\u2018Abbasid agents of persecution who sought to uphold Sunni orthodoxy, he fled from his family\u2019s\nhomeland in Syria and, disguised as an ordinary merchant, traveled westward through the Maghreb\nto Sijilmasa, where he went into hiding. In 909, local Isma\u2018ili missionaries rescued him from\nSijilmasa. By 920, he had consolidated power and made his capital at Mahdiya, located in present\nday Tunisia. As the mahdi and a catalyst for change, he converted tribal troops and inspired them\nto fight on his behalf. \u2018Abd Allah al-Mahdi endowed the Fatimids with a new \u2018asabiyah, providing\nthem with the unity of purpose necessary to defeat the \u2018Abbasids in North Africa. Within forty\nyears, \u2018Abd Allah al-Mahdi had conquered the whole of Northwest Africa. He aimed his expansion\nat Egypt but failed to seize it. His grandson, al-Mu\u2018izz, however, succeeded in this aim.\nAl-Mu\u2018izz (953 \u2013 975) used a combination of mamluk and tribal armies to capture Egypt\nin 969. Rather than contend with older, possibly rebellious cities like Alexandria, al-Mu\u2018izz\nfounded Cairo, the City of the Conqueror. He developed Cairo into the preeminent cultural and\neconomic center of the Islamic world, taking over from a Baghdad in decline. Al-Mu\u2018izz estab-\nlished al-Azhar, the largest and most famous mosque in Egypt, which also served as a religious\ncenter that focused on the theological development of Shi\u2018a Islam. Once in power, the Fatimids\nchanged the official state religion of Egypt from Sunni orthodoxy to Shi\u2018a heterodoxy, though the\nmajority of the population in Egypt remained Sunni Muslims.\nAl-Hakim (991 \u2013 1021) ascended to the throne of his father, al-\u2018Aziz, at the age of eleven.\nAs a young man, he quickly displayed a pattern of unpredictable behavior. Just four years after\ntaking command of the empire, he had his regent, the eunuch Barjawan, murdered. Additionally,\nal-Hakim earned a place in infamy by targeting Christians and Jews, worsening the generally\namiable relations with the People of the Book that the Fatimids had previously enjoyed. For\nPage | 326 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\ninstance, in 1004, al-Hakim prohibited Christians\nfrom celebrating Epiphany and Easter. He also\nforbad the use of wine, a prohibition which\ncaused religious difficulties for Christians and\nJews alike. In 1005, al-Hakim decreed the Law\nof Differentiation, requiring all of the People of\nthe Book to prominently display religious icons\nindicating their particular religious adherence.\nIn 1009, he became infuriated by some of the\nOrthodox Church\u2019s religious practices and conse-\nquently razed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in\nresponse. A few years later, he ordered the destruc-\ntion of thousands of churches and synagogues in\nPalestine. Al-Hakim even made Western pilgrim-\nage to the Holy Land difficult. During this period,\npilgrimages to Palestine had been increasing, and\nmany pilgrims returned home complaining of\nMuslim treatment of Christians in the Holy Land.\nHis behavior towards Christians elicited a strong\nFigure 8.17 | The Al-Azhar\nWestern reaction, for Europeans used his conduct\nAuthor: User \u201cBuyoof\u201d\nas a way to encourage support for the Crusades.

Ad-Darazi\nbelieved that universal rationality was made\nincarnate in the person of Adam and then passed\ndown through the prophets to the family of \u2018Ali\nand his descendants, including the Fatimids. His\ndoctrines eventually spread to the Levant, where\nthese ideas found reception amongst the Druze, a\ncognate of Darazi, although they viewed Ad-Darazi\nas a heretic. A follower of Isma\u2018ilism, al-Hakim did\nnot want to be associated with ad-Darazi and his\nteachings, so he had the preacher executed in 1018.\nAl-Hakim continued his tendency to display\nerratic behavior when he walked out into the desert\nin 1021 and never returned. While his disappear-\nance has remained a mystery for the ages, those\nwho worshiped the caliph believe that he went into Figure 8.18 | Al-Hakim\nAuthor: Al-Ahram\nOccultation, later to return as the messianic mahdi.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 327 8.12 THE CRUSADES\nIn 1071, the Great Seljuq Empire, under the leadership of Alp Arslan, defeated the\nByzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, near Lake Van, taking the Eastern Roman Emperor,\nRomanus I, prisoner in the process. This defeat was crushing for the Byzantines, allowing waves\nof Turkmen ghazis, or raiders, to press deep into the heartland of Anatolia, eventually establishing\nthe Sultanate of Rum, with its capital at Nicaea. A series of weak emperors succeeded Romanus\nI with Alexios Komnenos (1081 \u2013 1108) eventually ascending to the throne ten years later. As\nthe new emperor, he made peace with the Seljuqs of Rum, and the two states eventually adopted\ncordial relations. They began to trade with each other and even lent one another military support\nwhen needed. Alexius needed this military support in order to secure his borders from groups of\nTurkic marauders. To that end, he appealed to Pope Urban II (1088 \u2013 1099) for help recruit-\ning mercenary soldiers, namely Frankish knights. An effective cavalry, the Frankish knights had\nearned an impressive reputation for how they acquitted themselves on the battlefield.\nMeanwhile, European leaders had been searching for creative ways of expelling society\u2019s trou-\nblemakers and were not averse to sending their soldiers abroad, for the region was suffering from\noverpopulation and endemic violence. They believed that it was better for the martial groups in\ntheir society to fight against the Muslims than amongst themselves. In this way, the Crusades\nexternalized continental violence and promoted European peace.\nIn 1095, Urban II launched the first crusade from Clermont, a city in southern France. He had\nbenefited from recent church reforms, renewed religious fervor, and a concomitant increase in\npapal power. While traveling through France, he made an argument for the recovery of the Holy\nLand: because it belonged to Jesus, it should be controlled by his followers. He also appealed to\nthe greatness of the Franks, promising potential pilgrims a land flowing with milk, honey, and\nriches. And he offered them well-designed spiritual rewards. For example, salvation applied to\nthose who died on campaign, and anyone who invested in a crusade secured themselves a place\nin heaven.\nThe Crusades started in 1096 and were part of a larger process whereby Muslims ceded territory\nto non-Muslims, sometimes permanently. Provoked by al-Hakim\u2019s treatment of Christians in the\nHoly Land, as well as the Turkic invasion of Anatolia, Europeans commenced several centuries\u2019\nworth of armed crusades against the Muslim states of the eastern Mediterranean and North\nAfrica. Save for the first crusade, in which the Christians established the Crusader states of Edessa,\nAntioch, Tripoli, and the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, all of their campaigns ended in disaster. In\nfact, they were either looting expeditions or responses to the loss of Crusader states to Muslims.\nThe success that the Latin knights did enjoy related to not only the political fragmentation of the\nSeljuqs in the eastern Mediterranean, but also the general disinterest of the Fatimid Caliphate\nin Egypt, which had been dealing with both the repercussions of a religious schism and the con-\nsequences of famine and plague. Slow to respond to the challenge posed by the Christians, the\nFatimids watched the Crusaders from afar with indifference.\nThe Muslim counterattack eventually came under the direction of Salah al-Din (Saladin) (d.\n1193), a unifier of various Muslim factions in the eastern Mediterranean. An ethnic Kurd, he hailed\nPage | 328 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nfrom a family of soldiers of fortune in the employ of the Zengid Dynasty\u2019s Nur al-Din, a vassal of\nthe Seljuq Turks. Salah al-Din set off in his twenties to fight battles for his uncle, Shirkuh, a Zengid\ngeneral. A dynamic leader and tactician, he helped his uncle dispatch with the Fatimid opposition in\nEgypt and solidified Nur al-Din\u2019s rule there. His uncle dying soon thereafter, Salah al-Din eventually\nbecame the vizier, or senior minister, to Nur al-Din in 1169. For five years, Salah al-Din ruled Egypt\non behalf of Nur al-Din. Then Nur al-Din died in Damascus in 1174, leaving no clear successor.\n8.12.1 The Ayyubid Sultanate\nIn the absence of a formal heir to Nur al-Din, Salah al-Din established the Ayyubid Dynasty\n(1171 \u2013 1260), named after his father, Ayyub, a provincial governor for the Zengid Dynasty, a family\nof Oghuz Turks who served as vassals of the Seljuq Empire. Once in power, Salah al-Din estab-\nlished a Sunni government and insisted that the mosque of al-Azhar preach his brand of Islam. He\nused the concept of jihad to unify the Middle East under the banner of Islam in order to defeat the\nMap 8.13 | Map of The Ayyubid Sultanate, 1193 CE\nAuthor: User \u201cRo4444\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nPage | 329 Christians, but he did not principally direct jihad towards them. A champion of Sunni Islam, he\nbelieved that his religion was being threatened mainly from within by the Shi\u2018a. Like most of their\npredecessors, the Ayyubids also benefited from tribal \u2018asabiyah, or dynastic consensus. Ayyubid\n\u2018asabiyah included a Kurdish heritage, as well as a strong desire to return to Sunni orthodoxy. It was\nas champions of Sunni Islam that they purposely recruited leading Muslim scholars from abroad,\nultimately culminating in Egypt becoming the preeminent state in the Islamic world.\nInitially, Salah al-Din displayed no particular interest in the Crusader states. He had clashed\nwith the Crusaders, and King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem; also, Raynald de Ch\u00e2ntillon even had\nhanded him a rare defeat at the Battle of Montgisard in 1177. But the Crusaders ultimately brokered\nan armistice with Salah al-Din. Eventually, Raynald broke their truce when he started attacking\nMuslim pilgrims and trade caravans in the 1180s. Ensuing skirmishes between the forces of Salah\nal-Din and Guy de Lusignan, the new King of Jerusalem, presaged a forthcoming battle. In 1187,\nthe two sides met near Tiberias, in modern day Israel. Salah al-Din intentionally attacked the\nfortress of Tiberius in order to lure the Crusaders away from their well-watered stronghold. His\nplan worked, and the Christians quickly ran out of water. On the night before the battle, Salah\nal-Din set brush fires to exacerbate their thirst. He coerced the parched Latin Knights down\nthrough the Horns of Hattin towards the cool waters of Lake Tiberius. Salah al-Din bottlenecked\nthe Crusader forces, with the double hill of Hattin acting as a choke point.\nMap 8.14 | Map of the Battle of Hattin\nAuthor: User \u201cBenherz\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 330 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nThe Battle of Hattin represented a smashing victory for Salah al-Din and a major loss for\nthe Crusaders. Tradition dictated that Salah al-Din hold most of the leaders for ransom. Unlike\nthe Crusaders, he treated the defenders of cities with understanding. He showed tolerance of\nminorities, and even established a committee to partition Jerusalem amongst all the interested\nreligious groups. In this way, he proved his moral superiority to the Crusaders.\nWith most of their important leaders either killed in battle or captured, no unified Christian\nleadership remained to fight against Salah al-Din. Deprived of the backbone of their organization,\nthe Crusaders were left with only a few defenseless fortresses along the coast. Salah al-Din pressed\nhis advantage. Increasingly isolated and relying on ever dwindling numbers of Latin Christians\nwilling to remain permanently in the Holy Land, the Latin Crusaders were eventually expelled\nfrom the region in 1291.\nAlthough Salah al-Din had maintained direct control over Egypt, he intentionally distributed\ncontrol over wide swaths of the empire to loyal vassals and family members, whose governance\nbecame increasingly autonomous from Cairo. Salah al-Din\u2019s sons and grandsons, who did not have\nthe same ability as their forefather, had trouble managing an increasingly decentralized empire.\nWidespread mamluk factionalism and family disputes over the control of territory contributed to\nthe weakening of the sultanate. In this vacuum of power, the mamluks came to the fore.\n8.13 THE MAMLUK SULTANATE\nThe year was 1249, and Louis IX\u2019s seventh crusade had just gotten underway when as-Salih,\nthe last Ayyubid ruler, took to his deathbed. Under the eminent threat of a Crusader invasion,\nas-Salih\u2019s wife, Shajar al-Durr, a Turkish concubine, agreed to take over the reins of govern-\nment until her son, Turanshah, could assert himself. But he had never truly gained the trust of his\nfather, and a cabal of mamluks loyal to as-Salih murdered Turanshah. They then raised Shajar\nal-Durr to the throne. Her rule resulted in much controversy and suffered from many internal\nproblems. According to tradition, she sought recognition as sultana from the figurehead \u2018Abbasid\nCaliph, but he refused to pay homage to her. The mamluks responded by installing into power\none of their own, a certain Aybak. He married Shajar al-Durr, and she abdicated the throne. The\nmost powerful mamluk in Egypt, Aybak placated some of the opposition to Shajar al-Durr\u2019s rule\nand also dealt with Louis IX\u2019s crusade to Egypt. While mamluks did not possess a tribal \u2018asabiyah\nin the traditional sense, they did constitute a proud caste of elite warriors who had an exaggerated\nsense of group solidarity. As a social group, their former status as slaves provided them with\nenough group cohesion to overthrow the Ayyubids.\nShajar al-Durr remained unsatisfied in her new role, however. In fact, she saw herself as\nanother Cleopatra and wanted to rule in her own right. She also feared the consequences of\nAybak\u2019s potential marriage alliance with the daughter of the Ayyubid Emir of Mosul. In 1257,\nShajar al-Durr had Aybak strangled and claimed that he had died a natural death. However,\nQutuz, a leading mamluk, did not believe her story. Under duress, her servants confessed to the\nmurder. Qutuz arrested Shajar al-Durr and imprisoned her in the Red Tower. Not long thereafter,\nAybak\u2019s fifteen year old son, al-Mansur \u2018Ali, had Shajar al-Durr stripped and beaten to death. He\nPage | 331 Map 8.15 | Map of the Mamluk Sultanate, 1317 CE\nAuthor: User \u201cRo4444\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nreigned as sultan for two years until Qutuz deposed him, as he thought the sultanate needed a\nstrong and capable ruler to deal with the looming Mongol threat.\nThe Mamluk Sultanate appeared to be on a collision course with Hulagu\u2019s Ilkhanate, one of\nMongol Empire\u2019s four khanates, whose forces were advancing through the Mamluk-held Levant.\nThen in the summer of 1260, the Great Khan M\u00f6ngke died and Hulagu returned home with the\nbulk of his forces to participate in the required khuriltai, or Mongol assembly, perhaps expecting\nPage | 332 CHAPTER 8: ISLAM TO THE MAMLUKS\nto be elected the next Great Khan. Hulagu left his general Kitbuqa behind with a smaller army\nto fight the Mamluks. In July of that year, a confrontation took place at Ayn Jalut, near Lake\nTiberias. During the ensuing battle, the Mamluk General Baybars drew out the Mongols with a\nfeigned retreat. Hiding behind a hill, Aybak\u2019s mamluk heavy cavalrymen ambushed the unsus-\npecting Mongols and defeated them in close combat, securing a rare victory over the Mongols. The\nMamluks captured and executed Kitbuqa, and forced the remnants of the Mongol forces to retreat.\nJust days after their signal victory over the Mongols, Baybars (1260 \u2013 1277) murdered Qutuz,\ncontinuing a pattern of rule in which only the strongest Mamluk rulers could survive. Too clever to\nbe deposed, Baybars developed a strong military oligarchy that rested on the iqta\u2018 system, a cen-\ntralized system of land tenure based on money that, by the thirteenth century, had been perfected\nin Egypt. Under the iqta\u2018 system, individual mamluks received a percentage of profit from the sale\nof crops for their upkeep. Baybars owned all of the land, so mamluks only received the right to\ncollect taxes from the land, a right akin to usufruct in feudal Europe.\nBaybars relocated the \u2018Abbasid Caliph from Baghdad to Cairo in order to present a veneer of\nlegitimacy to mamluk rule. Since the Ptolemys, Egypt had been ruled by foreigners. In fact, the\nonly impact native-born Egyptians had was in religion. The Mamluk Sultanate practiced Sunni\nIslam and emphasized Sufism. Sufis believed that traditional, orthodox Islam lacked compassion,\nand their Sufism helped conversion efforts because of its emphasis on love and making a closer\nconnection to God, as opposed to a strict adherence to the dictates of the Quran. Sufis desired\nsomething more from religion and emphasized integrating the reality of God into man. Sufis\nthought that they could achieve a union with God based on love, a notion that contrasted sharply\nwith the general perception of orthodox Islam which denied believers a direct experience to God\nbecause Muhammad represented the Seal of the Prophets and all understanding of God came\nthrough the prophet. They set up new religious schools to pass on this Sufism. These madrasa\nconsisted of a complex, with a mosque, school, hospital, and water supply for each community.\nThe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries witnessed the decline of the Mamluk Empire. Several\ninternal and external factors help explain their decline. Domestically, the Black Death ravaged\nEgypt for years. In fact, it continued in North Africa longer than it did in Europe. This plague caused\neconomic disruption in the sultanate. With fewer people available, labor, or human capital, became\nmuch more expensive. Further, plague-related inflation destabilized the economy, as the value of\ngoods and services also rose. The mamluks responded to inflationary pressures by increasing taxes,\nbut their revenue from those taxes actually decreased. This decrease made it difficult for the mamluks\nto maintain their irrigation networks and, without irrigation, agricultural productivity decreased.\nExternally, plague was not the only cause of inflation. Columbus\u2019s discovery of the New World\nbegan a process in which gold began filtering through Europe and into North Africa. Egypt\u2019s weak\neconomy could not absorb this massive influx of money, thus causing more inflation. New trade\nroutes, like the one pioneered by Vasco de Gama, offered Europeans direct sea routes to Asia. No\nlonger was Egypt the middleman for long-distance trade between Europe and Asia, thereby losing\nout on valuable revenue from tariffs. The profits from commerce transferred to the ascending\nstates of Portugal and Spain. The decline of the Mamluks set the stage for the rise of the Ottomans.\nPage | 333 8.14 CONCLUSION\nA contemporary historian who served the Mamluk Sultanate, Ibn Khaldun astutely recognized\nthe applicability of his Cyclical Theory of History to the evolution of Islamic history during the\nperiod covered in this chapter. By the eighth century, Islam became the predominant social and\npolitical unifier of the Middle East. And for the next nine hundred years, various caliphates used\nfamily and religion as tools to rule the region. However, these caliphates faced religiously-inspired\nrevolts that challenged their authority. Quelling these revolts weakened the regimes, often leading\nto greater decentralization and the fragmentation of empires. Into these vacuums of power, new\nfamilies armed with tribal \u2018asabiyah and a novel religious ideology came forth to supplant a once\ndominant group who had succumbed to the wiles of civilization and whose influence gradually\nwaned in the face of insurgent desert peoples.\n8.15 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBerkey, Jonathan P., The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East 600 \u2013 800.

In the conflict that\nfollowed, the Portuguese plundered the Swahili city-states, burning buildings and enslaving African\nmen and women. Barbosa boasted that when the Portuguese looted the settlements, they slaughtered\nmany people and took a \u201cgreat spoil of gold and silver and goods.\u201d2 Barbosa\u2019s description highlights\nthe violence of Portuguese conquest and also his expectation that he and his countrymen were creating\na new Portuguese empire that would make a lasting mark in East Africa and the wider Indian Ocean\nworld. However, less than 100 years later, Portuguese influences were noticeably absent in most of\nEast Africa and their power in the Indian Ocean was fading rapidly. Barbosa, himself, had traveled with\nhis brother-in-law, Ferdinand Magellan, and met an untimely end (in his early 40s) in the Philippines.\nWriting about the coast of East Africa, Barbosa paid little heed to the hundreds of years of\nSwahili history that preceded his visit. Therefore, his narrative gives us minimal information\nabout Swahili civilization. This chapter will fill in some of the silences in the written historical\nrecord as it describes Africa\u2019s major contributions to World History.\nFigure 9.1 | Kibo Summit of Mt.

In addition to associating\nAfrica with extreme hardships, a plethora of western-made TV shows focus on wildlife and the\nrainforests. However, these popular images don\u2019t give an accurate portrayal of the everyday expe-\nriences of most Africans or tell us much about the history of the continent.\nOne of the main points glossed over by these popular images is that the African continent is\nlarge and diverse. Africa is the second largest continent in the world. Today, it has over 50 inde-\npendent countries. You can also find just about every imaginable environment, from savannahs,\nrainforests, and deserts, to glaciers and snow-capped mountains in Africa.

There are exceptions, but overall, African soils are poor and rainfall has been unpredict-\nable. Soils are comparatively unfertile, due in part to the geologic age of the continent. Also, the\nmore temperate climates in a number of regions slows the decomposition of organic materials\nin the soil, meaning that the soil in many regions has few minerals and nutrients. The areas that\nare exceptions, such as the highlands of Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Burundi, have seen much higher\npopulation concentrations. Rainfall also tends to be concentrated in just two or three months a\nyear, while disease has been yet another challenge.\nConsidering the past 5,000 years of African history, malaria, yellow fever, and trypanoso-\nmiasis (also known as sleeping sickness) have made the biggest impacts on population growth\nand settlement patterns. Even today, all\nthree diseases affect the continent. Both\nmalaria and yellow fever are spread\nto people by mosquitos. According to\nthe World Health Organization (WHO),\ndespite preventative measures and\ngreat efforts to extend the availability\nof treatments, malaria was responsible\nfor almost 600,000 deaths in 2013.\nChildren in Africa account for most of\nthe fatalities, and the WHO estimates\nthat currently one African child dies\nfrom malaria every minute of every\nday.4 Those who have suffered through\nmalaria multiple times as adults will\nattest that malaria, with the exception\nof its most virulent strains like plas-\nmodium falciparum, is usually more Map 9.2 | Climatic Map of Africa | Here you can see the\npresent-day climatic map of Africa.

Horses\nand many breeds of cattle are especially susceptible to trypranosomiasis, which is spread by the\ntsetse fly and can lead to either chronic illness, characterized by weight loss, fever, anemia, cardiac\nlesions, and other symptoms in animals, or to a more immediate death. Until the past fifty years\nor so, in many parts of the continent, these noteworthy challenges with disease, alongside the low\nfertility of the soils and the unpredictable rainfalls, were significant constraints on human pop-\nulation growth. Environmental challenges and disease also affected settlement patterns as, for\nexample, people avoided more forested and wetter areas because of the prevalence of mosquitoes.\nAdditionally, Africans continuously adapted their herding and farming techniques to overcome\nthese challenges.\n9.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

They have necessarily been on the forefront\nof methodological innovation because of the limited availability of written primary sources,\nmeaning sources recorded by ancient Africans themselves. Therefore, scholars have turned to a\nwide range of materials to complement the available written records.\nPage | 341 Before about 1800 CE, many African societies kept their records orally, as opposed to in written\nform. These societies have rich, complex histories that some past historians, relying primarily on\nwritten records, ignored when they studied the African continent.\nThe professionalization of the study of history in the West (meaning primarily in Europe\nand the United States), which entailed the transition from writing about the past out of personal\ninterest to writing about the past as a profession with established methodologies, mainly occurred\nin the 1800s. European and American views of Africans during that era were generally deroga-\ntory and prejudiced. These nineteenth century professional scholars tended to portray Africans\nas primitive, meaning unchanged from time immemorial. Western methodologies, with their\nreliance on written sources, backed up European views of Africans as unchanged. Two general\nresults of the nineteenth century scholarship in the West were the assumptions that Africa, which\nwas commonly referred to as \u201cthe dark continent,\u201d lacked a history prior to European arrival on\nthe continent and that any urban developments or complex state structures in Africa were the\nachievements of outsiders. For example, as you will see in this chapter, there were nineteenth\ncentury European scholars who credited people from Yemen with building the Axum trading\nempire and attributed the archaeological findings at Great Zimbabwe to Phoenicians. Especially\nsince the 1960s, there has been a strong movement to reclaim these (and other) developments\nas African. As part of this effort, scholars employ new methodologies, including the study of oral\nsources, archaeology, climate change, linguistics (the study of languages), and paleoarchaobotany\n(the study of ancient plant materials), to gain more accurate, multi-faceted information about the\nAfrican past.\nPerhaps most contested and also potentially the most revealing are the available oral sources.\nMany ancient African societies had special people tasked with orally transmitting official histories\nand preserved traditions. For example, griots in parts of West Africa memorized chronologies,\ncultural traditions, and legal precedence to advise kings and state leaders. Griots also traveled\nand performed theater and praise-songs throughout empires to spread cultural values and\ncommunicate news from governments. Griots held honored places in their societies, reflecting\ntheir importance to both rulers and people\u2019s everyday lives. Locally produced proverbs and oral\nteachings also played vital roles in many ancient African societies. Additionally, African commu-\nnities honored older generations for their knowledge of the past, leading Amadou Hampate Ba, a\nfamous author from Mali, to write, \u201cIn Africa, when an old man dies, it\u2019s a library burning.\u201d6 These\nexamples are just some of the ways that ancient peoples used oral traditions. Since the 1960s,\nscholars of Africa have recognized the importance of studying these oral sources as they convey a\ngreat deal of information about the past. Using oral sources is not without its challenges, but their\ninclusion has broadened the scholarly understanding of African societies.\n9.5.1 Terminology\nEspecially due to nineteenth-century tendencies to portray Africans as inferior, current\nscholars of Africa have a whole host of stereotypes to correct. One of the main stereotypes they\n6 Quoted in Ann Badkhen, Walking with Abel: Journeys with the Nomads of the African Savannah (New York: Riverhead\nBooks, 2015): 20.\nPage | 342 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\nencounter is the common perception that African societies are timeless, that they have not\nchanged in hundreds or thousands of years. The movie The Gods Must Be Crazy encapsulates this\nstereotype. The Gods Must Be Crazy (1980) is a fictional account that follows the San people in\nthe Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. The movie portrays the San as untouched by and unaware\nof the modern world until one member of their community finds a Coke bottle discarded from an\nairplane. In the movie, adventure ensues.\nMovies, television shows, and other media often show us an Africa that is rural, a landscape\ndominated by wild animals, and a continent isolated from the rest of the modern world. However,\nthese images do not accurately represent the continent in either our present time or the past.\nIn 2010, one-third of Africa\u2019s population lived in cities, and it is likely that one-half of Africa\u2019s\npopulation will be urban dwelling by 2030.7 Lagos (Nigeria) is Africa\u2019s largest city south of the\nSahara Desert, with population experts estimating that it is home to 21 million people. With this\nestimate, Lagos is on a par size-wise with cities like Beijing, Cairo, and Mexico City. Urbanization\non this scale is a fairly recent phenomena. However, this chapter will introduce you to some\nMedieval cities, including the famous city of Timbuktu, to discuss African urban cultures. We will\nalso explore the trade routes that connected Africa to much of the world, emphasizing that Africa\nhas been connected to the Arabian Peninsula, Asia, and Europe for millenia.\nEven if we do not intend it to, some of the language that we use on an everyday basis can\nperpetuate assumptions that Africa is isolated or behind the rest of the world. One example of\na potentially problematic term is \u201ctribe.\u201d As African historian Christopher Ehret has pointed\nout, the use of \u201ctribe\u201d in reference to Africans often carries the underlying judgement that the\npeople who are \u201ctribal\u201d are exotic, wild, backwards, and potentially dangerous. In common\nuseage, \u201ctribesmen\u201d are not modern citizens of nation-states, but instead remnants of the past. To\nhighlight the descriminatory use of the term, Ehret asks us to consider why African wars are often\nreferred to as \u201ctribal\u201d wars instead of as the civil wars they actually are, and,\n\u2026Why is Shaka, the famous nineteenth-century ruler, called the king of the Zulu \u201ctribe\u201d\nwhen he was actually the king of a centralized and military powerful state? Why are\nAfricans in \u201ctraditional\u201d dress said to be engaging in \u201ctribal\u201d dancing, when Europeans\ngarbed similarly in the clothes of an earlier time are said to be performing \u201cfolk\u201d dances?8\nEhret makes the case that the way that we commonly use \u201ctribe\u201d perpetuates a lot of the\nnegative stereotypes Europeans had of Africa in the nineteenth century. Furthermore, many\nhistorians question the idea that African \u201ctribes\u201d even existed prior to European colonization\nof the continent one hundred and fifty years ago. Instead, scholars discuss much more fluid,\nadaptive, or inclusive ethnic identities and suggest that nineteenth century Europeans tried\nto harden divisions and create \u201ctribes\u201d to suit their own administrative purposes. Dismissing\nAfricans as \u201ctribal\u201d also allowed European to legitimize the trans-Atlantic slave trade (in the\nfifteenth through nineteenth centuries) and colonizaton of the continent (in the nineteenth\n7 \u201cGrowth Areas: the urbanisation of Africa,\u201d Economist (Dec. 13, 2010), http://www.economist.com/blogs/daily-\nchart/2010/12/urbanisation_africa\n8 Christopher Ehret, The Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800 (Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia, 2002): 7.\nPage | 343 century). Today, people often fall back on \u201ctribe\u201d and \u201ctribal\u201d instead of trying to understand\nthe complexities of African politics and social organization.\nThere are a handful of other terms that modern scholars scrutinize to show that they are\nbased on similar prejudices. Two such terms are \u201cstateless society\u201d and \u201cbushmen.\u201d Many written\nsources from the nineteenth century produced by Europeans did not recognize the existence of\nstates in Africa that had more democratic, less centralized, or less hierarchical leadership struc-\ntures. These written sources assumed that all states had kings or other centralized authority\nfigures. They denied the existence of states organized in other ways. Some African societies were\ncentralized under the rule of monarchs, but others used, for example, councils of elders, had more\ndecentralized, egalitarian systems, or relied on age-sets to mobilize labor and manage government\naffairs. These latter examples had functioning governmental structures, but nineteenth century\nEuropeans usually did not recogize these alternative forms of state organization and claimed\nthat Africans were incapable of ruling themselves without European intervention. The use of the\nphrase \u201cstateless society\u201d was one way that Europeans claimed to be more advanced and thus\ndestined to colonize Africa in the nineteenth entury.\nAccording to this same nineteenth-century ideology, the \u201cbushmen\u201d and \u201cpygmies\u201d of Africa\nwere hopelessly behind and isolated from modern times. The San people featured in The Gods\nMust Be Crazy are an example of a society sometimes referred to as \u201cbushmen.\u201d Scholars now\nconsider \u201dbushmen\u201d and \u201cpygmy\u201d to be derogatory when used in reference to Africans because of\nthe history of the terms. Over the past two hundred years, the terms have been coupled with as-\nsumptions of a lack of historical development, isolationism, and a lack of participation in modern\neconomies. These assumptions do not reflect the reality of hunter-gathering societies. Instead,\nscholars have shown that hunter-gathering societies have long been in regular contact with pas-\ntoralists and people living in agriculturally-based societies in Africa. Most people,who in the past\nwould have been labeled bushmen or pygmies, prefer to be referred to by their linguistic or ethnic\nidentities in order to avoid the stigmas attached to these terms and to avoid being lumped in with\npeople with whom they share very little. If we understand how words like tribe, stateless societies,\nand bushmen have been used in the past, then we can avoid perpetuating some of the problematic\nstereotypes about Africa.\nOverall, as you read this chapter, keep in mind that Africa has been a continent of innovation\nand change since the first behaviorally modern humans emerged there between 200,000 and\n100,000 years ago. Africans were some of the first farmers and some of the first iron-workers.\nAfricans developed their own artistic traditions (see Figure 9.2, Map 9.3, Figure 9.3) and unique\nstate structures. With such a big, diverse continent to consider, this chapter examines four civi-\nlizations (states of larger scale and complexity) to show major changes impacting the continent.\nEach of these states was also connected to the rest of the world. The chapter starts with ancient\nEthiopia in Northeast Africa (300 to 700 CE) and moves to the Western Sudanic Empires in the\nSahel of West Africa (800 to 1591 CE). In the second half, it discusses Great Zimbabwe (1200 to\n1450 CE) and, finally, the Swahili states in East Africa (1000 to 1500 CE).\nPage | 344 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\nFigure 9.2 | An Example of a Map 9.3 | Map of Nok Culture | The Nok were Figure 9.3 | A lifesize\nTerra-Cotta Statue Produced just one innovative community in ancient Africa. bronze head found at\nby the Nok Culture, c. 550 BCE They were a sophisticated Iron-Age civilization Ife (Nigeria) | Created\n| The Nok people lived in what is (c. 1000 BCE) now known for their terra-cotta by a Yoruba artist in the\ntoday Northern Nigeria. sculptures. thirteenth century CE, it\nAuthor: User \u201cDaderot\u201d Author: Locutus Borg may represent a member\nSource: Wikimedia Commons Source: Wikimedia Commons of the royal family.\nLicense: Public Domain License: Public Domain Author: Locutus Borg\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\n9.6 AKSUM AND ETHIOPIA\nAksum, which was at its most powerful in the fourth through sixth centuries CE, was located\nin what are today Ethiopia, Eritrea, and parts of Sudan. At its high point, Aksum extended its\ninfluence beyond Africa into parts of the southern Arabian Peninsula as shown on the map below.\nAksum was a great trading empire, with its own coinage, its own language, and its own distinctive\nChristian church. If you are familiar with accounts of the Queen of Sheba, you know pieces of the\nstory that Ethiopians use to explain the origins of the Ethiopian Solomonic Dynasty and their\npossession of the Ark of the Covenant. (Visit the following link to view a map of the Kingdom\nof Aksum: http://www.earlheinrich.com/Ancient%20Nubia/Aksum_Empr-Map-72dpi.jpg. The\ncapital of the kingdom was the city of Aksum and its most important port was Adulis. You can see\nthat the kingdom stretched into the Sudan and Yemen at its height in the sixth century.)\nUnlike some other regions in Africa, Ethiopia had very fertile, volcanic soils that supported\nlarge populations. Climatic variation found at the different elevations throughout Ethiopia also\nencouraged agricultural diversification and trade. Around 7000 BCE, there was population\ngrowth in the region that corresponded with the Agricultural Revolution. While some domesticat-\ned animals and crops were introduced from Northeast Africa and the Fertile Crescent, Ethiopians\nPage | 345 domesticated other crops themselves. Most notably, Ethiopians domesticated teff, a grass, and\nnsete, known as the \u201cfalse banana,\u201d that they ground to make bread and porridge. We also have\nEthiopians to thank for coffee! Since the Neolithic Revolution, Ethiopia stands out for its agricul-\ntural productivity and innovation, both of which sustained large populations in the region.\nThe Kebra Nagast (\u201cThe Glory of Kings\u201d), a 700 year old text that is sacred for Ethiopian\nChristians and Rastafarians, traces the origins of the Ethopian royal family back to the Queen of\nSheba and King Solomon of Jerusalem. The Kebra Nagast identifies the Queen of Sheba as an\nEthiopian ruler known locally as Queen Mekeda. According to the text, in approximately 950\nBCE, the newly enthroned Queen Mekeda traveled to study with Jerusalem\u2019s well-known king, King\nSolomon. Queen Mekeda wanted a capable mentor for leadership advice and spiritual guidance.\nCharmed by her, King Solomon played these roles and Queen Mekeda, flattered by his attentions,\nwas a hardworking tutee who eventually converted to Judaism. As their lessons continued, King\nSolomon planned the seduction of Queen Mekeda, which, as described in the text, occurred when\nSolomon tricked and cornered her. Their sexual union produced a child, Menelik I, to whom Queen\nMekeda gave birth on her journey home to Ethopia.\nAs time passed, King Solomon remained haunted by\na dream that Menelik was his rightful sucessor and was\ndelighted when his son, as an adult, returned to Jersusalem.\nAccording to the Kebra Nagast, King Solomon intended\nfor Menelik to follow him as the next king of Jerusalem,\nbut Menelik refused and instead returned to Ethopia.\nIn an unexpected twist, when leaving Jerusalem, part of\nMenelik\u2019s entourage stole the Ark of the Covenant, which\nheld the Ten Commandments. When King Solomon dis-\ncovered the theft, he sent soldiers to recapture the Ark of\nthe Covenant. However according to the Kebra Nagast,\nGod helped Menelik and his men evade capture by lifting\nthem up over the Red Sea. In the end, Menelik and the Ark\nof the Covenant made it safely to Ethopia. For Ethiopian\nChristians, the Kebra Nagast partially explains the\nformation of the Ethopian Orthodox Church (the Tawahedo\nChurch). Through today, the Ethopian Orthodox Church\nclaims possession of the Ark of the Covenant, which it\nFigure 9.4 | The Queen of Sheba |\nsays is housed in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in The Queen of Sheba as illustrated by\nAksum, Ethiopia. Conrad Kyeser in the early fifteenth century.\nAuthor: Conrad Kyeser\nAccording to the Kebra Nagast, early Ethiopian rulers\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nwere descendants of King Solomon through Menelik I. License: Public Domain\nMore than two thousand years after King Solomon\u2019s rule,\na thirteenth century Ethiopian king, Yekuno Amlak (r. 1270 \u2013 1285 CE), reclaimed this legacy by\ntracing his origins back to King Solomon and Queen Mekeda. He founded what became known as\nthe Solomonic Dynasty, which ruled Ethiopia for about 500 years from 1270 to 1769 CE. Members of\nPage | 346 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\nEthiopia\u2019s royal family continued to\nclaim descent from King Solomon up\nthrough the last Ethiopian emperor,\nHaile Selassie, who was overthrown\nin 1974. Therefore, the link back to\nKing Solomon and Queen Mekeda\nis part of Ethiopian religious beliefs\nand has also legitimized claims to\npolitical power.\nFrom the era of the rule of\nQueen Mekeda in about the tenth\ncentury BCE and Yekuno Amlak\u2019s\nrevival of the Solomonic Dynasty\nin the thirteenth century CE, the\nlargest kingdoms in Ethiopia were Figure 9.5 | The Building that Allegedly Houses the Ark of\nDa\u2019amat and Aksum.

In the 1960s and License: CC BY-SA 3.0\n1970s, archaeologists excavating\nthe Kingdom of Da\u2019amat unearthed evidence of the region\u2019s role in trade and its connections to\nSouthern Arabia. Archeological finds show that, by the seventh century BCE, ivory, tortoiseshell,\nrhino horn, gold, silver, and\nslaves were brought from\ninterior regions of Africa and\ntraded through Da\u2019amat for\nimported cloth, tools, metals,\nand jewelry. Inscriptions,\nimagery, architectural styles,\nand even overlaps in histori-\ncal traditions (such as those\nassociated with the Queen\nof Sheba) also suggest close\nconnections between the\nKingdom of Da\u2019amat and\nSaba (Yemen) in Southern\nArabia. For example, the\nFigure 9.6 | The Temple at Yeha, Located in Northern Ethiopia | Kingdom of Da\u2019amat used\nYeha was likely the first capital of the Kingdom of Da\u2019amat. religious symbols in its\nAuthor: User \u201cJialiangGao\u201d\nmonumental architecture,\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 including the disc and\nPage | 347 crescent, also found in Southern Arabia. The oldest standing building in Ethiopia, the Temple at\nYeha (c. 700 BCE), had an altar with these symbols. Up until several decades ago, some scholars\nused evidence of these connections to argue that people from Saba founded the civilization at\nDa\u2019amat. Now, in line with the trend to reclaim African civilizations, very vocal scholars push us to\nacknowledge the African origins of the Kingdom of Da\u2019amat and view it as a precursor to the trading\nempire of Aksum.\nThe Kingdom of Da\u2019amat weakened in the fourth century BCE as Red Sea trade became more\nimportant than some of the previous northern overland routes. It gave way to the state of Aksum,\nwith its important cities of Adulis and Aksum. Adulis, positioned on the coast, rose in prominence\nand grew wealthy. It served as a safe harbor for ships traveling from Southeast Asia. The growing\ncapital city in the interior, Aksum, was a stopover point for land-based trade routes into the Sudan\nand especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Ivory, slaves, tools, spices, gold, silver jewelry, copper, and\niron were eventually traded through the capital city of Aksum to the coast. The state of Aksum\nbegan minting its own gold and silver coins in the third century CE, demonstrating how important\nlong-distance trade was to its economy.\nIn addition to its role in inter-regional trade, Aksum was also known for its early conversion to\nChristianity. Ethiopian tradition traces the establishment of Christianity in the region back to two\nshipwrecked Syrians. One of the Syrians, Frumentius, was particularly influential because he became\nthe first bishop of Ethiopia in 303 CE and guided the king of Aksum, King Ezana (r. 325 \u2013 350 CE),\nFigure 9.7 | The Church of Debre Damo | In the sixth century CE, Christians exiled due to doctrinal diputes\nsought refuge in Ethiopia. Once there, they founded the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Subsequently, one group of\nOrthodox monks built a monastery at Debre Damo. Debre Damo is located on an isolated mountain top in northern\nEthiopia. To this day, it is accessible only by rope ladder and no women (or female animals) are allowed up the rope.\nAuthor: User \u201cGiustino\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.0\nPage | 348 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\nin his conversion to Christianity. Some of the coins minted in Aksum actually attest to King Ezana\u2019s\nconversion as the coins from the first half of Ezana\u2019s reign have the disc and crescent symbols of\nearlier Ethiopian rulers, while coins from the later decades of Ezana\u2019s reign have a Christian cross. As\nbishop, Frumentius also encouraged Christian merchants to settle in Aksum. About a century later,\nChristianity in Ethiopia grew further as the state offered refuge to Christians fleeing persecution due\nto doctrinal disputes within the Church. Nine priests, breaking with the Church in Jerusalem, settled\nin Ethiopia and founded the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. They maintained ties with the Coptic\nChurch in Egypt and developed a distinct liturgy using Ge\u2019ez, the local language. Members of the\nEthiopian Orthodox Church also incorporated local beliefs, such as the legendary connection to King\nSolomon, into their religious traditions.\nThe ruling family, coastal elites, and military leaders amassed significant wealth during\nthe height of Aksumite power. Like the Aksumite kings before him, Ezana amassed wealth by\ncollecting tribute from surrounding states and taxing trade. Aksum and its surrounding states\nwere agriculturally productive with fertile soils and effective irrigration systems. Their agricul-\ntural productivity meant that the work of peasants and the wealth generated through foreign\ntrade supported the ruling classes and elites. Building a powerful miitary, King Ezana expanded\nthe empire and claimed control over most of Ethiopia, Nubia, and Saba (Yemen). He also used\nhis assets to showcase his power with, for example, \u201cconquest stones\u201d that commemorated his\nvictories. In addition to celebrating Ezana\u2019s military strength and commitment to ruling fairly,\nthe \u201cconquest stones\u201d also proclaimed that God had ordained his reign. The stones impart Ezana\u2019s\nedicts and Christian beliefs. One section reads:\n[\u2026] The Lord of Heaven strengthens my dominion!\nAnd as he now has conquered my enemy, (so)\nMay he conquer for me, where I (but) go! As\nhe now has given me victory and has over-\nthrown my enemies.\n(So will I rule) in right and justice, doing no\nwrong to the peoples. And I placed\nThe throne, which I have set up, and the Earth\nwhich bears it, in the protection of the Lord\nof Heaven, who has made me king\u20269\nEzana is known to us because of archaeological findings, including the aforementioned conquest\nstones. He and other Aksumite kings also famously commissioned the construction of stelae\n(singular: stele). Stelae were tall rectangular pillars with rounded tops set up to mark the under-\nground grave sites of Aksum\u2019s royalty and elite. The most ornate stelae were elaboratedly carved\ninto a marble-like material with faux doors at the bottom and multiple stories, as indicated by\nwindows etched into each level. They have been described as \u201cancient skyscrapers,\u201d with the\n9 As quoted in Esperanza Brizuela-Garcia and Trevor Getz, African Histories: New Sources and New Techniques for Study-\ning African Pasts (Boston: Prentice Hall, 2012): 33-36.\nPage | 349 largest being one hundred and eight feet tall. Most stelae\nhave fallen in the over 1700 years since their construction,\nbut several do remain standing. One stele even caused\ninternational uproar as the Italians took it during their\noccupation of Ethiopia at the onset of the Second World\nWar and just recently returned it at great expense.\nThe stelae demonstrate the wealth of Aksum\u2019s\nruling classes and links between the ruling generations.\nUnfortunately, the graves marked by the stelae have been\ncleared out by tomb robbers in the intervening years.\nHowever, small remnants of glass, pottery, furniture,\nbeads, bangles, earrings, ivory carvings, and objects\ngilded in gold attest to the wealth buried with affluent\nAksumites. These artifacts also show the availability of\ntrade goods brought from long distances. Furthermore,\nthe architecture of the stelae is suggestive of connections\nback to earlier kingdoms. For example, the rounded top\nof the stelae is reminiscent of the disc symbol found in the\nregion as far back as the Kingdom of Da\u2019amat. Ezana was\nthe first Christian king in the region; however, the archi-\ntecture that he commissioned maintained ties to Aksum\u2019s\npre-Christian past.\nAksum\u2019s power began to wane at the end of the sixth\ncentury CE. First, the Persian Empire interrupted Aksum\u2019s\ntrade with parts of southern Arabia in the late sixth century.\nThen, Muslims increasingly dominated trade along the Red\nSea coast and the most profitable trade routes shifted from\nthe Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. In response, Aksum shrank\nas Ethiopia\u2019s Christian rulers turned away from coastal trade\nand became more dependent on the tribute they collected\nfrom agriculturally productive regions to their south.\nAs Muslims in coastal areas became more powerful\nand Christian rulers shifted their attentions away from the\ncoast, the relationship between Ethiopian Muslims and\nChristians remained complex. In the seventh century CE,\none king of Aksum, al-Najashi Ashama Ibn Abjar, gave\nsanctuary to some of the first followers of Islam before he\nFigure 9.8 | A Stele Built during\nhimself converted.

However, there were\nalso periods of conflict, especially after Muslims unified to form the Adal Sultanate in the fourteenth\ncentury. The Adal Sultanate militarily extended its influence over much of the region and for several\ncenturies supported a thriving, multi-ethnic state. In the sixteenth century, Ethiopian Christians allied\nwith the Portuguese to fight against the Adal Sultanate. After the fall of the Adal Sultanate, Ethiopian\nChristians rejected Portuguese attempts to convert them to Catholicism and forced Portuguese mis-\nsionaries out of the region in 1633 CE.\n9.7 THE WESTERN SUDANIC STATES\nWho comes to mind as the richest person ever? Many economists and historians propose a person\nwho might surprise you: Mansa Musa. Mansa Musa was an emperor in the Western Sudan during\nthe Middle Ages. He was so rich that the people of his own time could not even fathom his wealth.\nUnable to put a dollar amount on Mansa Musa\u2019s bewilderingly large fortune, Rudolph Ware, a current\nprofessor at the University of Michigan,\ninstructs us to \u201cimagine as much gold as\nyou think a human being could possess and\ndouble it...\u201d10 Other sources estimate that,\nadjusted for inflation, Mansa Musa was\nworth $400 billion.11 How did Mansa Musa\nbecome so wealthy? Like the other Western\nSudanic rulers, he controlled much of the\nworld\u2019s access to gold during a period when\ngold was in very high demand.\nMap 9.4 shows the large area in\nWest Africa commonly referred to as the\nWestern Sudan.

The Sahel,\nwhich in Arabic means \u201cthe shore,\u201d is a transition zone between the Sahara Desert to its north and\nthe more forested regions to its south. Much of the Sahel is grassland savannah. Straddling regions\nwith different climates, the people of the Western Sudan developed productive agriculture, trade\nnetworks, and an urban culture. The architecture of the Western Sudanic states stands out for its use\nof mud (adobe) to construct its monumental buildings, such as the Great Mosque in Djenne (Figure\n10 Jacob Davidson, \u201cThe 10 Richest People of All Time,\u201d Time (July 2015) http://time.com/money/3977798/the-10-richest-\npeople-of-all-time/\n11 \u201cMusa\u2019s Money.\u201d BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02f9r6g\nPage | 351 9.9) and Aksia the Great\u2019s tomb in Gao\n(Figure 9.11). From roughly 800 to 1600\nCE, the people of this region organized and\nsupported\u2014sometimes under duress\u2014the\nlarge states that dominated the Western\nSudan. Three of the best known of these\nstates became the empires of Ghana (800\n\u20131070s CE), Mali (1230s \u2013 1430s CE), and\nSonghai (1460s \u2013 1591 CE).\nThe leaders of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai\ncame to dominate the region because they\ncontrolled access to West African gold. An\nMap 9.5 | The Sahel\nincrease in the demand for West African\nAuthor: User \u201cMunion\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons gold corresponded with the rise of these\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 empires. The spread of Islam and rise of\nnew states along the North African coast\nand in Europe gave the biggest boost to the demand for gold. Monarchs in Europe and North Africa\nwanted West African gold to mint coins. To meet the demand, Berber traders used newly introduced\ncamels to carry gold north across the desert. Then, they loaded up their camels with big slabs of salt\nto return south. The people in many parts of West Africa considered salt a valuable commodity due\nto their distance from the ocean and the time required to extract salt from plant, animal, and other\nresources. While the demands for gold and salt drove the trade, weapons, manufactured goods,\nslaves, textiles, and manuscripts also passed through the desert. With the flow of all of these goods,\nthe Western Sudanic states emerged at the nexus of the trans-Saharan trade routes.\nThe North African Berber traders crossing the Sahara Desert were early converts to Islam, and\nthey introduced Islam to market towns of the Western Sudanic states. With continuing trade, the\nregion\u2019s connections with Northeast Africa and the Middle East grew through the Middle Ages.\nGrowing urban areas, like Timbuktu, attracted Muslim scholars. In later centuries, the kings of\nMali and Songhai deliberately fostered these connections with the larger Islamic World due to their\nreligious beliefs and, sometimes, to enhance their status and secure their positions. For example,\nAskiya Muhammad, the king of Songhai from 1495 to 1528, successfully sought recognition as\nthe \u201ccaliph of Sudan\u201d from Egyptian rulers. The new title brought him prestige within the Islamic\nworld and Africa. Therefore, trans-Saharan trade brought Islam to the Western Sudan, and many\nof the kings of Mali and Songhai cultivated their relationships with Muslims in Northeast Africa\nand the Middle East. As a result, Islam influenced the culture and lifestyle, particularly of urban\nresidents, in the Western Sudan.\n9.7.1 Ghana\nWe associate the first powerful empire, Ghana (800 \u2013 1070s CE), with people who spoke\nthe Soninke language and lived in the area between the Niger and Senegal Rivers\u2014parts of\nPage | 352 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\npresent day Mauritania and Mali. In this region, agricultural productivity supported labor\nspecialization, urban areas, and eventually state formation. From as early as 300 BCE, the\nregion\u2019s farmers used iron tools to grow an abundance of crops. Archaeological evidence found\nat Djenne-Jeno, one of the earliest urban areas in the Western Sudan, which has been dated to\napproximately 250 BCE, suggests that people had access to plenty of rice, millet, and vegeta-\nbles. Iron technologies also allowed craftsmen to make iron spears and swords so people could\nprotect themselves. Probably for defense purposes, Soninke speakers began joining together to\nform the ancient state of Ghana around 300 CE. Then, as the populations continued to grow,\nthe state expanded its territory.\nEven before Ghana was a state with a clearly defined centralized administration, Soninke\nspeakers had been involved in extensive systems of trade using the region\u2019s complex river\nsystems. They often acted as middlemen, trading in fish from the rivers, meat from herders, and\ngrains from farmers. After 300 CE, Ghanian leadership began collecting tributary payments from\nneighboring chiefdoms. In the centuries that\nfollowed, Ghana\u2019s leaders used their ability\nto tax trade to build an empire. By 800 CE,\nthey had consolidated their control over trade,\ntheir authority over urban areas, and their\nreign over tributary states.\nEspecially in the minds of the Arab\nscholars chronicling the history of this period,\nthe gold trade defined Ghana. They heard\nabout the large caravans with hundreds of\ncamels passing through the Sahara Desert on\ntheir way to and from Ghana. To build their\nfortunes, the Ghanian kings taxed trade goods\ntwice. They taxed gold when it was initially\nbrought from the forested regions in the south\nto their market towns and again right as the\nBerber traders departed for the north. News\nof Ghana\u2019s wealth spread to the extent that\nMedieval Arab scholars who had never even\ntraveled to Africa wrote about the Ghanian Map 9.6 | Map of the Trans-Saharan Trade Routes |\nNote how the routes crossed to settlements, like\nkings.

Al-Bakri recognized the centrality of gold to the\nfinances of the Ghanian kings. According to him, the kings claimed all of the gold nuggets for\nthemselves, leaving only gold dust for everyone else. By this time, the Ghanian kings had also used\ntheir wealth to build strong armies, with archers and calvary, to collect tribute and carry out the\nempire\u2019s expansion.\nAl-Bakri\u2019s depiction of Ghana\u2019s capital city, Koumbi Saleh, also evidences the introduction\nof Islam to the region. He described two separate sites within the capital city, Koumbi-Saleh. To\ntrade their wares, the merchants used one site, which was clearly Muslim with mosques, while the\nking lived in a royal palace six miles away. The separation between the sites and lack of mosques\nnear the royal palace suggest that Islam had primarily impacted the market towns; the leadership\nand masses of Ghana did not convert.\n9.7.2 The Mali Empire\nDue to attacks from the Muslim\nAlmoravids from the North, issues\nwith overgrazing, and internal rebel-\nlions, Ghana declined in the eleventh\ncentury, opening up an opportunity\nfor the rise of Mali. The origins of the\nMali Empire (see Map 9.7) are asso-\nciated with the king Sundiata Keita\n(c. 1217 \u2013 1255 CE). An epic, recounted\norally by griots for centuries and\nwritten down in various forms in the\ntwentieth century, relates the story of Map 9.7 | The Mali Empire, c. 1350 CE | The empire\nencompassed over 400,000 miles, including territory in the\nSundiata\u2019s rise.

With\nloyal followers and the attributes of a born leader, Sundiata overcomes these and other challenges\nin the epic to found the new empire. Under Sundiata, some of Mali\u2019s leadership converted to\nIslam; however, even with conversion, they maintained important pre-Islamic traditions. The\nepic demonstrates the prevalence of syncretism or the blending of religious beliefs and practices\nin West Africa. For instance, the epic traces Sundiata\u2019s background back to Bilali Bounama, one\nof the early followers of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, and the powerful pre-Islamic, local\n12 Quoted in \u201cKingdom of Ghana: Primary Source Documents.\u201d African Studies Center.

According to oral tradition, Sundiata\u2019s ability to draw from both\nMuslim and traditional African sources of strength allows him to overcome adversity and defeat\nhis less worthy opponents.\nLike Sundiata, most of the subsequent kings of Mali combined Muslim and local religious\ntraditions. For example, they often completed the \u201cFifth Pillar\u201d of Islam by performing the hajj,\nthe pilgrimage to Mecca required of all able Muslims. In the meanwhile, they continued to use\npre-Islamic amulets, maintain their animistic beliefs, and consider pre-Islamic sacred sites to\nbe important. Similarly, when they converted, the people living within Mali\u2019s cities and those\ninvolved in trans-Saharan trade also blended Muslim and traditional beliefs and practices.\nSundiata built the Mali Empire in the thirteenth century and the empire reached its height\nunder Mansa Musa (c. 1280 \u2013 1337 CE), in the early fourteenth century. Through diplomacy and\nmilitary victories, Sundiata swayed surrounding leaders to relinquish their titles to him. Thus,\nSundiata established a sizeable empire with tributary states and became the mansa, or emperor,\nof Mali. Most of the subsequent mansas of Mali maintained their control over the gold-salt trade,\nthe basis of their wealth. Mali also developed a more diversified economy and was recognized in\nEurope, North Africa, and the Middle East as a prosperous trading center.\nMansa Musa, who was likely Sundiata\u2019s grandson or grandnephew, further developed the\nempire and made it one of the crossroads of the Medieval Islamic World. Mansa Musa used a large\narmy of approximately 100,000 soldiers to reunify the empire after several tumultuous decades.\nUnder Mansa Musa, Mali stretched much farther east, west, and south than had its predecessor\nkingdom, Ghana. With its access to\nvery diverse environments, trade in\nagricultural produce became more\nimportant in Mali than it had been\nin Ghana. Farmers specialized in\nregional crops and the state operated\nfarms where slaves grew food for the\nroyal family and the army. Mansa\nMusa also developed the empire\u2019s\nadministration, dividing the territory\ninto provinces and appointing\ncompetent governors. With all of\nthese achievements, Mansa Musa is\nbest remembered for going on the hajj\nFigure 9.9 | The Great Mosque in Djenne | The Great Mosque in\nfrom 1324 to 1325 CE.

By about 800 CE, the Sorko had created their own state,\nSonghai, trading along the river and building a military that used war canoes. With the growth of\ntrans-Saharan trade and eventually the discovery of new gold fields, the Sorko and other ethnic\ngroups in the area established market towns in Songhai. Most of the people who moved to these\nmarket towns converted to Islam by the eleventh century. In the early fourteenth century, the\nMali Empire collected tribute from Gao, though other parts of the Songhai state remained in-\ndependent. Using his military to pick off pieces of Mali in its waning years, Sunni Ali built the\nSonghai state into an empire in the 1460s.\nDuring its Golden Age, the Songhai Empire was ruled by Askia Mohammad I (r. 1493 \u2013 1528).\nReferred to as Askia the Great, Askia Mohammad I was a devout Muslim, who centralized the\nempire\u2019s administration, encouraged agriculture, and further expanded the state. Askia rose to\npower as the general-in-chief of the army of Gao. He won a military victory over Sunni Ali\u2019s son\nto found a new dynasty, the Askia dynasty. As a devout Muslim, Askia went on the hajj to Mecca\nfrom 1496 \u2013 1497. The pilgrimage brought him international recognition and reinforced his\nclaims to power especially because the Sharif of Mecca bestowed Askia with the title \u201cthe Caliph\nof the Sudan.\u201d Upon his return, Askia used Islam to validate attacks on neighboring states, like the\nMossi in 1498. He also rebuilt Islamic centers. Leo Africanus, originally from Granada (Spain),\ntraveled through Timbuktu in 1526 and wrote,\n[\u2026] There are in Timbuktu numerous judges, teachers, and priests, all properly appointed\nby the king. He greatly honors learning. Many hand-written books imported from Barbary\n[the coastal regions of North Africa] are also sold. There is more profit made from this\ncommerce than from all other merchandise.13\nUnder Askia, Timbuktu, Djenne, and Gao, once again, beckoned scholars and people with com-\nmercial aspirations. Taxing gold remained an important source of revenue for the king, but trade\nexpanded to incorporate items such as manuscripts, kola nuts, prisoners of war (who were sold as\nslaves), horses, and cowry shells (which were used as an internal currency). Additionally, to cen-\ntralize his administration, Askia appointed loyal Muslim governors to new provinces, replacing\nhereditary rulers. After his death, Askia\u2019s sons, particulary his last son, Askia Dawud (r. 1549 \u2013\n1582 CE) continued to generate wealth by taxing trans-Saharan trade. Like their father, they also\ntended to invest in Songhai\u2019s Islamic centers. For example, during the reign of Dawud, there were\napproximately one hundred and fifty Islamic schools operating in Timbuktu. Askia Dawud\u2019s death\nin 1582 saw the reemergence of power struggles amongst competing rulers and rebellions within\n13 \u201cLeo Africanus: Description of Timbuktu.\u201d From The Description of Africa (1526). http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_\nciv/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/leo_africanus.html\nPage | 357 tributary states, signaling the end of\nthe Golden Age of Songhai.\nThen, the biggest blow to the\ncrumbling Songhai Empire came from\nthe invasion by Morocco in 1591. The\nMoroccan army used new technology,\nmuzzle-loading firearms, to defeat the\nSonghai troops. The Songhai state\nlimped along until 1737, but after\n1591, it was no longer a unified empire\nwith control over numerous tributary\nstates.

However, the\nMoroccan invasion eroded their\npower. Furthermore, the Age of Exploration, begun by the Portuguese in their progress down\nthe West Africa coast in the fifteenth century, redirected trade. Trans-Saharan trade diminished\nand was largely replaced by trade up and down the Atlantic coast of West Africa.\n9.8 THE SPREAD OF AGRICULTURE AND GREAT ZIMBABWE\nMost of the languages indigenous to Africa belong to one of the major language groups shown\nin Map 9.9. Over the past several decades, historians of Africa have started to pay more attention\nto these language groups. They use comparisons of core vocabulary words in related languages to\nexamine the spread of ancient technologies and the interaction between peoples. Using linguis-\ntics (the study of languages), historians corroborate information found in other sources, like oral\ntraditions of dynastic origins and archaeological findings.\nToday\u2019s scholars are not the first ones to notice linguistic similarities on the continent. During\nEuropean colonization one hundred and fifty years ago, anthropologists grouped Africans into\n\u201ctribes\u201d based on presumed physical, cultural, and linguistic similarites. Involved in this classi-\nfication, anthropologists and others noticed striking similarities amongst the languages spoken\nby about 400 different ethnic groups in the southern and eastern third of the continent. They\nfound that people in most of Sub-Saharan Africa spoke languages that used the root \u2013ntu to\nrefer to person, with the prefix ba- added in the plural. Combining the root and the plural prefix,\nnineteenth-century colonial anthropologists referred to people in these communities as Bantu\nand later traced Bantu languages back to a root, a mother language spoken in parts of Cameroon\nPage | 358 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\nand Nigeria. To explain the similarities\nin the languages, European scholars\nhypothesized that about 2,000 years\nago there was a Bantu Migration, a\nmassive departure of thousands of Bantu\nspeakers from the Bantu homeland. As\nthey described, Bantu-speakers imposed\niron technology and traditions of agricul-\nture on the peoples they encountered in\neastern and southern Africa. Influenced\nby their own conceptions of coloniza-\ntion, nineteenth century anthropologists\nportayed the Bantu Migration as a rapid\nconquest of Sub-Saharan hunter-gath-\nerer societies by the technologically\nadvanced, Iron Age Bantu speakers.\nSince the 1990s, historians of Africa\nhave used linguistics to reject some pieces\nof the nineteenth-century description of\nthe Bantu Migration. Referring instead Map 9.9 | Map showing the Distribution of the Six Major\nLanguage Families in Africa | While it is not marked, the\nto Bantu expansions, they generally\nBantu homeland was in parts of Nigeria and Cameroon.

Bantu speakers took License: CC BY-SA 2.5\nmultiple routes, and sometimes their\nmovement occurred on the scale of a single family, as opposed to a mass of thousands. From\nthe linguistic evidence, historians also suspect that both Bantu speakers and those they settled\namongst contributed ideas and technologies; there was mutual \u201cteaching and learning from one\nanother.\u201d14 The current view of the Bantu expansions is much more complex as it recognizes give\nand take between Bantu newcomers and indigenous populations. For example, some indigenous\npopulations rejected Bantu languages, while others repackaged Bantu technologies incorporat-\ning their own innovations. There was no Bantu migratory conquest of indigenous communities.\nInstead, the study of linguistics seems to confirm that Bantu languages, iron-working, and\nagriculture slowly spread through eastern and southern Africa in the early centuries CE.\nThese corrections are important because they allow scholars to much more accurately discuss\nstate formation in southern Africa. In the colonial era, European scholars sometimes jumped to\nmisleading conclusions when they encountered evidence of early African states. For example,\n14 As quoted in Brizuela-Garcia, Esperanza and Trevor Getz, African Histories: New Sources and New Techniques for Study-\ning African Pasts.

Historians used oral tradition and linguistics to track\nAfrican state formation in the region and show that Great Zimbabwe was a Bantu civilization.\nArchaeologists and historians concluded that from approximately 1200 to 1450 CE, Great\nZimbabwe was the thriving commercial and political center of a rich southern African state.\nDuring the Middle Ages, a\nprosperous elite based in Great\nZimbabwe ruled over about 300\nsettlements on the Zimbabwe\nPlateau.

From the coast, these goods\nwere carried to the Persian Gulf, India, and China. In exchange, Great Zimbabwe\u2019s elite imported\nluxury items like stoneware, colored glass beads, and cotton. Out of these imports, artisans based\nin Great Zimbabwe made jewelry, ornaments, and cloth for elite consumption.\nThe architectural evidence of Great Zimbabwe\u2019s social hierachies is one of the most dramatic\nelements of the site\u2019s ruins. Covering three square miles, the ruins of Great Zimbabwe consists of\nmany clusters of stone buildings. The most famous structures are the Hill Complex (Figure 9.13)\nand the Great Enclosure (Figure 9.12). The stone buildings were constructed with local granite,\nand the stones were stacked without mortar. Scholars hypothesize that the ruling elite resided\nand performed ceremonies on the Hill Complex, symbolically demonstrating their authority\nwith the height and separation of the complex. From about 1300 CE, more than 15,000 people\nlived in the valley below them in small, circular homes with thatched roofs and walls made\nof clay and gravel. The Hill Complex overlooked a number of other structures, including the\nfamous Great Enclosure. With its stone walls up to thirty-five feet tall, the Great Enclosure was\nthe largest structure in precolonial sub-Saharan Africa. The Great Enclosure was a ceremonial\nsite, perhaps used by religious leaders or as a site for the initation of youth. Scholars disagree\nabout its exact function, but suggest that the Great Enclosure further demonstrated the status\nand wealth of the capital city and the ruling classes.\nGreat Zimbabwe declined in the fifteenth century and was abandoned by 1450 CE. Some\nscholars suggest that the site deteriorated because it was supporting up to 30,000 people and thus\nbecame too crowded, deforested, and stripped bare of resources through overuse. Surrounding\ngold mines may have also been depleted. In any case, trade shifted to support the rise of two new\nkingdoms, Batua to the west and Mutapa to the east. Both kingdoms built stone walls like those seen\nin Great Zimbabwe and practiced mixed agriculture, using cattle for ceremonies and as symbols\nof the ruling elite\u2019s power. From the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries, the kingdoms also\nfaced the Portuguese and the influx of other African populations. The Mutapa Kingdom lasted\nthe longest, enduring until 1760. Overall, this rewritten history of southern African statehood\nacknowledges the significance of the Bantu expansions that brought agriculture and iron to many\nregions. It also celebrates the African origins of great civilizations and demonstrates how Africans\nshared technologies and cultural practices across the Zimbabwean plateau.\n9.9 THE SWAHILI CITY-STATES (EAST AFRICA)\nIn the tenth century CE, a grand Persian sultan, Sultan Ali ibn Sulaiman al-Shirazi sailed to\nKilwa Kisiwani, an island off the East African coast. When he arrived, he was generous and people\nliked him, which enabled him to marry the daughter of Mrimba, the local headman. The newlyweds\nwere set up to live more or less happily ever after. However, Sultan Ali and Mrimba made a deal,\nbrokered by Mrimba\u2019s daughter. The deal gave Sultan Ali control of the island in exchange for\nenough cloth for Mrimba to \u201cwalk on it from the island to his new abode on the mainland.\u201d15 The\ndeal went through and Mrimba moved to the mainland, but then Mrimba regretted relinguishing\n15 John Middleton, The World of the Swahili: An African Mercantile Civilization, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994): 31-32.\nPage | 361 his position and plotted to militarily retake\nthe island from his son-in-law. In response,\nSultan Ali used magic from the Qur\u2019an to\nstop Mrimba\u2019s plot. By reading the Qur\u2019an in\na special way, Sultan Ali kept the sea levels\nhigh, which confined Mrimba to the mainland,\nwhere he gave up and retired. Upon Mrimba\u2019s\ndeath, his mainland territory passed to the son\nof Sultan Ali who also ruled Kilwa Kisiwani.\nIn this oral tradition, the union of Mrimba\u2019s\ndaughter and Sultan Ali forged a new Muslim\nfamily, with Persian and African ancestry, that\nruled Kilwa Kisiwani and the mainland coast.\nThe above version is just one account\nof Kilwa Kisiwani\u2019s origins; nevertheless, it\nconveys some very important elements of\nSwahili identity. Starting at least by the thir-\nteenth century CE, in response to resident\nArab merchants who scorned non-Muslims\nand some African practices, African elites in\nEast Africa claimed descent from Shirazis\n(Persians) and to have been early converts to\nMap 9.10 | The Swahili Coast of East Africa |\nIslam. In some cases, the connections may\nFrom 1000 to 1500 CE, numerous Swahili states\nhave been exaggerated or inaccurate from a emerged along this 1,000 mile stretch from Mogadishu\nhistorical standpoint.

Source: Wikimedia Commons\nAs it controlled gold coming from Great License: Public Domain\nZimbabwe, Kilwa Kisiwani became one of the\nmost prosperous of the Swahili city-states. From 1000 to 1500 CE, Swahili city-states were\nwealthy urban areas connected both to the African interior and the larger Indian Ocean World.\nDozens of Swahili city-states running down the East African coast from Mogadishu to Sofala, and\nincluding islands off the coast, were commercial centers, tied together by a shared identity, not an\noverarching political structure. In addition to Islam and claims to Persian ancestry, Swahili identity\nalso became associated with Indian Ocean trade, an urban style, and a shared language (Swahili).\nHistorians of Africa trace the origins of the Swahili city-states to the Bantu expansions, ex-\nplaining that by the first century CE, Bantu farmers had built communities along the East African\ncoast. They traded with southern Arabia, southeast Asia, and occasionally Greece and Rome.\nAlthough trade contracted after the fall of the Roman Empire, it rebounded several hundred years\nlater. At that time, residents of the Swahili city-states played a pivotal role as middlemen, selling\ngold, timber, ivory, resins, coconut oil, and slaves from the interior regions of Africa to traders\nPage | 362 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\narriving from throughout the Indian Ocean World. In return, Swahili elites bought imported glass,\nporcelain, silk, spices, and cloth. The seasonal monsoon winds that allowed trade between the\nSwahili coast and southern Arabia, the Persian Gulf, and southeast Asia also facilitated cultural\nexchange. Blowing towards the East African coast three to four months of the year and reversing\nseveral months later, the monsoon winds stranded traders for months at a time, encouraging\nintermarriage and cultural exchange. Furthermore, the wealth of the Swahili coast attracted\nPersian and Arab immigrants. With African, Arabian, and southeast Asian influences, Swahili\nculture became a blended culture as, for example, the Swahili language incorporated loan words\nfrom Arabic and Hindi.\nOne of the quintisessential features of the Swahili city-states from 1000 to 1500 CE was their\nurban style. A few families made up the elite, ruling classes, while most people in the cities were\nless wealthy, working as craftsmen, artisans, clerks, and sailors. People in villages along the coast\ncould also identify as Swahili. Claimants of\nSwahili identity spoke the Swahili language\nand were Muslim. Archaeology shows that\nemerging Swahili cities had mosques and\nMuslim burial grounds starting in the eighth\ncentury CE. By their height, the Swahili\ncity-states were distinctly Muslim; they had\nlarge mosques built of local coral stone. The\nSwahili, regardless of their economic status,\ndrew a distinction between themselves as\nMuslims and the \u201cuncultured,\u201d non-Muslim\nAfricans of the interior.\nThe elite families played a role in fash-\nioning Swahili urban style. In addition to\ntracing their descent back to some of the\nearliest Muslim settlers from Persia, they\nembraced Islam, financing mosques, prac-\nticing purdah (the seclusion of women),\nand hosting large religious celebrations.\nTheir Muslim identity stimulated trade, as\nvisiting Muslim merchants felt comfortable\nextending credit to them and living with\ntheir Swahili host families while waiting for\nthe winds to turn. By 1350 CE, the urban Figure 9.14 | The Great Mosque at Kilwa Kisawani |\nSultan Suleiman ibn Muhammed (r. 1421 \u2013 1442 CE)\nstyle of Swahili city-states exhibited a dis-\nimproved the mosque. The mosque was constructed of\ntinguishing architecture. Many of the cities coral blocks, which became a defining feature of urban\nbecame \u201cstone towns\u201d with wealthy Swahili Swahili architecture.\nAuthor: Claude McNab\nfamilies constructing multi-level homes\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nout of the coarse coral. The Swahili elite License: Public Domain\nPage | 363 used their stone houses to establish themselves as prominent, creditworthy citizens. They wore\nimported silk and cotton and ate off imported porcelain to further display their status. Like other\nSwahili, the ruling classes distinguished themselves from non-Muslims of the interior. They may\nhave been partially moved to draw this distinction by their desire to sell as slaves people captured\nin the neighboring, non-Muslim communities.\nSlavery within the Indian Ocean World, the zone of contact and interaction connecting\npeople living adjacent to the Indian Ocean, began well before the spread of Islam in the seventh\ncentury CE. During the high point of the Swahili city-states, Muslim traders controlled the slave\ntrade within the Indian Ocean World. Slaves tended to be captives of war sold to the Arabian\nPeninsula and regions near the Persian Gulf. Slaves were put to work as sailors, agricultural\nlaborers, pearl divers, domestic workers, concubines, and musicians. Our information about the\neveryday lives of slaves in this region is very limited.\nIn one famous revolt, slaves from East Africa (the Zanj), who were forced to work on sugar\nplantations and salt flats near Basra (in present-day Iraq), seriously challenged the power of\nthe Abbasid Caliphate. Led by Ali ibn Muhammad, the Zanj rose up in the Zanj Rebellion, a\nguerrilla war against the Abbasids. For fourteen years, the Zanj and their supporters, altogeth-\ner an estimated 15,000 people, raided towns, seized weapons and food, and freed slaves. They\ncaptured Basra and came within seventy miles of Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. The rebels created\ntheir own state with fortresses, a navy, tax collection, and their own coinage. At enormous cost,\nthe Abbasids finally put down the revolt in 883 CE using a large army and by offering amnesty to\nthe rebels. Scholars have used the Zanj Rebellion to examine the scope of the Indian Ocean trade\nin East African slaves, the conditions of slavery in the Indian Ocean World, and the agency (the\nability to exert their own will) of slaves. Some of these scholars suggest that the Zanj Rebellion\nled Muslims in Arabia to largely abandon the practice of using East African slaves as plantation\nlaborers. The rebellion helps them explain why the Indian Ocean slave trade developed differently\nthan the trans-Atlantic slave trade.\nWhile there were some similarities between the trans-Atlantic trade that brought slaves to the\nAmericas and the slave trade within the Indian Ocean World, there were important differences.\nBoth slave trades took Africans, contributing to an African diaspora, or a dispersal of African\npeoples and their descendants, all over the world. The trans-Atlantic slave trade, which lasted\napproximately 300 years and reached its peak in the eighteenth century CE, forced approximately\n12 million people, mostly from West Africa, into the Americas. The slave trade within the Indian\nOcean lasted much longer, about 2000 years, and was generally smaller in scale. Scholars suggest\nthat African slaves in the Indian Ocean World had more social mobility, especially since many of\nthem were skilled soldiers. Also, according to Islamic precepts, slaves had some basic rights and\ncould be incorporated into the households that they served. Theoretically, a freeborn Muslim\ncould not be enslaved. Unlike slavery in the Americas, slavery within the Indian Ocean World was\nnot racially codified, so freed slaves did not automatically face racial discrimination. And due to\ntheir reproductive capacities, women were more sought after as slaves within the Indian Ocean\nWorld, while the trans-Atlantic slave trade had the highest demand for young men. Despite these\ngeneral trends, there was great individual variation within the slave experience.\nPage | 364 CHAPTER 9: AFRICAN HISTORY TO 1500\nMoving up the East African coast in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the\nPortuguese sacked some Swahili cities and tried to tax trade. In 1498, when they happened\nupon the Swahili coast, the Portuguese were trying to establish a direct sea route to the riches\nof India and China. After using an East African guide to reach India, the Portuguese began\nto set up a Trading Post Empire, which intended to tax trade within the Indian Ocean.\nThe Trading Post Empire consisted of a series of forts along the Indian Ocean coast where\nPortuguese administrators collected taxes and issued trade permits. In the early 1500s, the\nPortuguese returned to the Swahili city-states to enforce their will. As the Swahili city-states\ndid not have a unified political structure or large armies, the Portuguese successfully looted\nand destroyed some Swahili cities. However, the Portuguese cultural influence and their ability\nto enforce tax collection was very limited north of Mozambique. The Portuguese did not move\ninland beyond the coastal cities and, by and large, trade within the Indian Ocean continued\nwithout a great deal of Portuguese interference. However, the Portuguese presence encouraged\nSwahili leaders to ally with the Omanis from southern Arabia. In 1699, the Omanis, working\nwith some Swahili rulers, seized Mombasa from the Portuguese, and began an era of Omani\ndominance of the Swahili coast.\n9.10 CONCLUSION\nThese African states showcase the continent\u2019s connections to the rest of the world, a multitude\nof African innovations, and the importance of using a variety of methodologies to interrogate\nlong-held assumptions about Africa.\nAfrica was not isolated. Instead, oceans and deserts were \u201chighways\u201d in these periods. Aksum,\nthe Western Sudanic states, Great Zimbabwe, and the Swahili coast were all commercially linked\nto Europe, the Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf, southeast Asia, and even\nChina. Although there were local differences, the ruling classes in each of the states collected\ntribute from outlying areas and participated in long-distance trade. The wealth of these states\nsupported labor specialization, urbanization, and other innovations.\nAfrican states contributed to great cultural change. As just one case in point, Ethiopia, the\nWestern Sudanic states, and the Swahili city-states all experienced religious transformations.\nNot only did Ethiopia serve as a sanctuary for both Christians and Muslims, but Ethiopians also\nestablished their own Church, the Ethopian Orthodox Church. Starting in the thirteenth century\nCE, Western Sudanic rulers converted to Islam, maintaining some of their pre-Islamic beliefs\nwhile building their connections with the rest of the Islamic World. Medieval African cities like\nTimbuktu benefitted from these connections. They attracted traders as reports of African gold\ncirculated far and wide. Taxing the gold trade, Western Sudanic rulers developed these cities\nas both trading depots and places of scholarly learning. The Swahili in coastal East Africa also\nembraced Islam as one of the defining features of their identity. Their urban style reflected the\ncentrality of Islam, which they believed distinguished them as cultured and refined. All four states\nalso developed numerous other innovations, such as those in art, architecture, metal-working,\nagriculture, and political organization.\nPage | 365 Before the twentieth century, foreigners recorded much of Africa\u2019s written history. There are\nlimitation to their accounts, meaning that a number of written documents about Africa are mislead-\ning, at best. Many African societies remembered their own histories orally, using professionalized\nclasses of historians, storytellers, and musicians, in addition to proverbs and the teachings of elders.\nOver the past fifty years, historians of Africa have done more to incorporate Africa\u2019s oral traditions\ninto their examination of the ancient past. They have also used linguistics and archaeology to create\na more accurate written history of the continent and reclaim African civilizations.\n9.11 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nAli, Omar.

There is one square twice as large as that of the city of Salamanca,\nsurrounded by porticoes, where are daily assembled more than sixty thousand souls,\nengaged in buying, and selling; and where are found all kinds of merchandise that the\nworld affords, embracing the necessaries of life, as for instance articles of food, as well\nas jewels of gold and silver, lead, brass, copper, tin, precious stones, bones, shells, snails,\nand feathers. \u2026There is also an herb street, where may be obtained all sorts of roots and\nmedicinal herbs that the country affords. There are apothecaries\u2019 shops, where prepared\nmedicines, liquids, ointments, and plasters are sold; barbers\u2019 shops, where they wash and\nshave the head; and restaurateurs, that furnish food and drink at a certain price. There\nis also a class of men like those called in Castile porters, for carrying burdens\u2026.Painters\u2019\ncolors, as numerous as can be found in Spain, and as fine shades; deerskins dressed and\nundressed, dyed different colors; earthenware of a large size and excellent quality; large\nand small jars, jugs, pots, bricks, and an endless variety of vessels, all made of fine clay,\nand all or most of them glazed and painted; Maize, or Indian corn, in the grain and in the\nform of bread, preferred in the grain for its flavor to that of the other islands and terra-\nfirma; p\u00e2t\u00e9s of birds and fish; great quantities of fish, fresh, salt, cooked and uncooked ; the\neggs of hens, geese, and of all the other birds I have mentioned, in great abundance, and\ncakes made of eggs; finally, everything that can be found throughout the whole country is\nsold in the markets, comprising articles so numerous that to avoid prolixity and because\ntheir names are not retained in my memory, or are unknown to me, I shall not attempt to\nenumerate them.1\nThe above is from Hern\u00e1n Cortez\u2019s description of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, the Aztec capital he and\nhis Tlazcalan allies conquered in 1521. As the Spanish explorers in the Americas, and later the\nFrench, English, and Dutch, saw monetary gain from reporting their exploits to their respective\nmonarchs, we often end up with a stilted or incomplete version of the Americas before 1500.\nPart of this can be attributed to the bias of European explorers, and misinterpretation of Native\nAmerican beliefs and practices.\nUndoubtedly the most misunderstood practice was that of human sacrifice witnessed by the\nSpanish conquerors of the Aztec Empire. Among Mesoamerican and Andean peoples alike there\nwas a belief that all life, cosmic, human, animal, and plant alike, grew beneath the soil and sprung\nforth above the surface. Furthermore, humans had a role in nurturing that life cycle. In many of\nthe cultures we will discuss, shamanism was an important religious tradition whereby shamans or\nreligious specialists could control the forces of the natural world. Often shamans would conduct\nceremonies requiring sacrifice from members of his community to ensure cosmic and earthly order.\nWhile the Spanish (and Hollywood) tend to focus on more dramatic ceremonies where hearts are\n1 Hern\u00e1n Cortez. Second letter to Charles V, Mexico, 1520. https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/\nclassroom-content/teaching-and-learning-in-the-digital-age/the-conquest-of-mexico/letters-from-hernan-cortes/cortes-de-\nscribes-tenochtitlan\nPage | 369 cut from living warriors, other kinds of sacrifices in Mesoamerica and the Andes were integrated in\nhundreds of ways into daily life. For many cultures ritual bloodletting was a widespread practice,\nbut one where the injured party survived to perform the ceremony the next year. Often times,\nhuman-shaped grain cakes would serve as stand-ins for actual human participants. Most sacri-\nfices in fact were actually offerings or prayers to Mesoamerican or Andean deities. For example a\nNahua newborn might be named in honor of Maya rulers. Or the first corn tortilla of the day might\nbe consumed in honor of the sun.2 These beliefs would eventually be manifest in physical struc-\ntures like a cave under Teotihuac\u00e1n\u2019s Pyramid of the Sun in Mexico or sunken plazas at Chav\u00edn\nde Huantar in Peru and Tiwanaku in Bolivia. These sacred spaces were constructed beneath the\nearth\u2019s surface to allow the cultures aboveground easier access to the Earth\u2019s creative capacity.\nAs historians, it also is helpful to point out some of our myopic tendencies regarding the peopling\nof the Americas. In Chapter One we talked about discrepancies regarding the date at which Homo\nsapiens arrived in the Americas. While there is evidence supporting an overland migration from\nBeringia, and geographically speaking the Beringia migration is the most logical explanation, some\nscholars argue that this approach has become \u201cdogma\u201d and even \u201cideology,\u201d leaving no room for\nevidence that may challenge this explanation. While we cannot argue that we are close to aban-\ndoning the Beringian migration as the most likely theory, there is mounting evidence that suggests\na seaborne migration from Asia or even a \u201cSolutrean\u201d migration from Europe ten thousand years\nbefore an ice-free corridor opened up in North America.3 Considering new theories may help us\nexplain how the Americas came to be populated and how civilizations developed so quickly here.\nA third weakness in our narrative of the Americas involves the demographic collapse of the\nindigenous population that occurred after the arrival of European diseases. Especially in the\nCircum-Caribbean, millions of indigenous peoples succumbed to European disease and overwork\nin the first decades of the sixteenth century, giving them little opportunity to construct their own\nhistorical narrative apart from the one that Europeans were writing.\nKeeping these limitations in mind, our task in this chapter is to admire a pre-Columbian history\nwhere in a little over 15,000 years migrants from Asia (probably) populated the Americas by foot,\nbuilt hundreds of major cities, supported a population in the tens of millions, and constructed\ntwo of the most impressive empires the world has ever known. Fortunately recent advances in\narchaeology and calendrics have helped us uncover much of this pre-Columbian past that had\nbeen largely clouded by our obsession with the triumph and tragedy of the European conquest.\n10.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

The Mesoamerican culture area is found in what\nare now the modern countries of Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, and eastern Honduras.\nThe region\u2019s frequent volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and hurricanes gave it quite a staggering\namount of ecological diversity including mountains, coastal plains, and a peninsular limestone\nplatform (the Yucat\u00e1n). The region\u2019s climatic diversity is attributable to the fact that it sits in both\ntropical and subtropical latitudes.\nLess is known about migration to Mesoamerica than for North and South America during\nthe Paleoindian period, but many scholars put people in the region by 15,000 BCE. These early\nresidents hunted large and small game alike and consumed a wide range of plant resources.\nThe Archaic period in Mesoamerica stretched from 8000 to 2000 BCE, during which scores of\ncultures adapted to the region\u2019s ecological diversity by domesticating wild food sources like \u201cbeans,\nsquash, amaranth, peppers, and wild Maize (teosinte).\u201d4 The maize of large kernels of today took\nthousands of years of domestication for Mesoamericans to produce, but by the formative period\nit was a staple crop supporting tens of thousands. Groups living closer to the coast could also take\nadvantage of wetland crops, such as manioc.\n10.5.1 Early Farming in Mesoamerica\nJust as early farmers in Southwest Asia turned wild plants into domestic crops, so too did\ntheir contemporaries in Mesoamerica with maize, squash, and tubers. Foragers in the southern\nMexican highlands lived on a diverse diet of plants and animals, including cactus fruit, corn,\nsquash, beans, fish, deer, and rabbits. Their contemporaries in the tropical lowlands further south\nconsumed tubers like manioc, sweet potato, arrowroot as well as fruits like avocadoes. While\nMesoamericans did domesticate most of these crops, they did so before becoming sedentary, a\nfact revealing the existence of regional variations in the path to agriculture. Around 10,000 years\nago, Mesoamericans began to cultivate squash, both as a food source and as storage containers.\nRather than staying near their cultivated land, however, early planters formed mobile \u201cagricul-\ntural bands\u201d that still hunted and would return to harvest mature squash or chilies. Over time,\nthese bands planted more and hunted less until eventually they formed sedentary agricultural\nvillages. But that process took at least 2,000 years. In fact, it may have been in the much denser\ntropics in and around Panama where residents first left foraging behind for agriculture. Around\n10,000 BCE, after the extinction of megafauna, these tropical peoples begun to cultivate their\nforest environment. Tropical cultivation tended to be cramped, but tropical residents did manage\nto domesticate the tubers like manioc, sweet potato and arrowroot that we mentioned above.5\nOver the next several centuries, village dwellings themselves revealed a growing emphasis\non permanence and increasing sophistication. Brick walls and plaster floors began to replace\nhides and sticks. Unlike round huts, new rectangular houses allowed for expansion by extending\nwalls and adding a perpendicular end wall. Expanding permanent dwellings allowed villages to\ngrow through natural population increase. Permanent dwellings also helped establish distinc-\n4 Michael E. Smith and Marilyn A.

Not only did villages have to decide where and how to build, they also\nhad to organize around when to plant, where to settle, when to harvest, and where to store the\nfood. The invention of pottery during this period served storage needs tremendously. Tasks in\nconstruction, gathering, defense, and food production became more specialized and supervised,\nleading to the beginnings of class. The elite developed, a strata usually comprising warriors,\npriests, and administrators.\n10.5.2 The Formative Period\nBy the beginning of the Formative Period around 2000 BCE, most residents of Mesoamerica\nwere sedentary, many living in small bands that moved only seasonally.6 However, by 300 CE\nmany of these small bands had been replaced by quite common large urban centers. This was a\nrapid transition, to say the least. This rapidity was possible because of greater use of domesticated\ncrops and storage and improved technology, like pottery vessels. Pottery appeared between 1900\nBCE and 1750 BCE on the Pacific coast of Chiapas in highland valleys and on the Gulf coast.\nAfter about 1400 BCE, scholars start to see widespread sharing of obsidian, shell, jade, and iron\nartifacts, a sharing which denotes significant interaction by this point. A social hierarchy also\nbegan to develop in Chiapas, where there was a two-tiered settlement hierarchy of small centers\nand villages. In other words, the elite had bigger houses. Over time and in more areas, plastered\nfloors and dirt floors appeared in different dwellings and altars in others. Burials too indicated\nsocial differentiation.\nThe Olmec were the earliest\ncivilization in Mesoamerica and,\ntherefore, drove much of this\nrapid development. The Olmec\ndeveloped along the Gulf of Mexico\nand flourished during the Early\nFormative and Middle Formative\n(1500 \u2013 400 BCE), while the Late\nFormative (400 BCE \u2013 100 CE)\nsaw their evolution and transfor-\nmation. Scholars use this timeline\nwith the caveat that Mesoamerica\nhouses a number of unique cultural\ntraditions, and there are variations\nwithin this timeline in terms of\nMap 10.1 | Map of the Formative Era Sites, c. 600 BCE\nwhen they developed urbanization, Author: User \u201cMadman2001\u201d\nstates, agriculture, and certain Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\ntechnologies. The Olmecs\u2019 most\n6 Christopher Pool, Olmec Archaeology and Early Mesoamerica, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 7.\nPage | 373 notable accomplishment was their monumental stone sculpture. Other Mesoamerican cultures\nhad stone monuments, but the Olmec versions were unique in their sophistication, size, and\nnumber. A common theme occurs during the coherent tradition spanning 1400 BCE to 400 BCE.\nStatues were carved out of thrones or in low relief on stelae. The largest of them weighed over forty\ntons. Stones had been transported as much as ninety km from their sources. The labor required to\ndo this demonstrates the power of these rulers. Aside from statue carving, Olmec elites also com-\nmissioned carved columns, drains, and embellishments in large houses. An inordinate amount\nof iron trade also occurred, and objects like polished iron mirrors were found in the tombs of\nhigh-ranking individuals. The import of jade sculptures was perhaps even more prominent with\nthousands of tons of \u201cserpentine blocks\u201d buried in massive offerings at the Olmec center of La\nVenta in southern Mexico.7\nMany of these monuments were commissioned by or for elite members of an increasingly\nsophisticated socio-economic hierarchy first seen in the Early Formative Olmec of San Lorenzo.\nSan Lorenzo itself stood at the apex of a three- or four-tiered settlement hierarchy which included\nsubordinate centers, villages, and special purpose sites. This increasing sophistication became so-\nlidified through Olmec politics as well. Early in the Formative Period most groups were organized\nin tribes, but the Olmec soon began to form a set of chiefdoms that allowed for organized leader-\nship across generations, albeit through kinship ties. The Olmec also became the first civilization\nin the region to develop a state, where the same hierarchy became more stratified and institutions\nbecame more specialized.\nSome scholars even call the Olmec an \u201cempire,\u201d but most say it falls short for a few important\nreasons. First, the Olmec never had a large enough population at their disposal to form a con-\nquering army. Second, while there existed a number of significant urban Olmec sites, such as La\nVenta and San Lorenzo, none of them has been identified as an Olmec capital. Finally, the art and\narcheological records of surrounding societies don\u2019t indicate an Olmec domination but rather the\nexistence of something of a theocratic state, as elites seemed to have both political and religious\nauthority and a considerable amount of influence.\nFinal questions related to our understanding of the region are: Why did the Olmec evolve at\nall, and why did they evolve when they did? One theory involves the ecological relationship to\nMesoamerica\u2019s lowland environment. Another holds that increasing productivity led to high popu-\nlation growth, which caused a pressure to organize politically. Control of these resources as well as\nthe limited use of warfare accounted largely for the authority of individual chieftains. Other scholars\nhave added to this observation, pointing out that the abundance but lack of diversity of Olmec area\nagriculture forced them to develop a competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis societies that lived closer to\nobsidian, salt, and stone deposits. (The Olmec would need to trade for these resources that were\ncentral for hunting and food production). A more sophisticated society would have that advantage.\nOnce the Olmec did manage to organize as states, they began to plan for their permanence.\nFrom the above-mentioned stone deposits, the Olmec produced their cultural hallmark: monu-\nmental stone sculpture. Around 1650 BCE, the Olmec began to produce stone effigy bowls, but these\nare much smaller than the monumental sculptures that followed. Over 200 known monumental\n7 Pool, 15.\nPage | 374 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\nstone sculptures remain; one-third are from\nSan Lorenzo and the surrounding area. The\ncolossal heads are the largest; some stand\nup to three and a half meters tall. Each head\nis unique, containing its own ear ornaments,\nheaddress, specific facial features, and\nexpressions. Most scholars think they are\nportraits. Table top altars have been found\nin a range of sizes across Olmec sites. Most\nnow believe they served as thrones but\nothers believe they served as altars as well.\nThey often show humans emerging from a\nniche in front of the monument. The Olmec\nalso crafted smaller sculptures in the round.\nThese sculptures incorporated human and\nsupernatural themes or humans in ritual or\nsymbolic postures. A fourth sculptural style,\nFigure 10.1 | Olmec Colossal Head, La Venta, Mexico\none that corresponds to later periods, was\nAuthor: User \u201cHajor\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons stelae. These stelae often depicted supernat-\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 ural beings and elaborately dressed individ-\nuals engaged in specific actions. These stone\nsculptures would be impressive for modern humans to achieve but are made more impressive\nconsidering the fact that the Olmec possessed no metal tools with which to cut them.\nThe purpose behind these sculptures, outside of their artistic value, seems to have involved\nmonumentality. Stone as a whole gave a sense of order, stability, and equilibrium. The harmonic\nproportions in the works enhanced those ideas. The sculptures also contained a good enough\nmix of naturalism and abstraction to give a nod to the spiritual world as well. For the Olmec as\nshamanists, a direct connection existed between order on earth and order in the spiritual world.\nOlmec shamans, through ritual and through the assistance of their nagual (also referred to as\nnagualo) or \u201canimal spirit companions,\u201d could travel to the supernatural world or guard against\nspirits who desired them harm.8 Therefore, a number of altars and smaller sculptures show hu-\nman-jaguar or human-dragon anthropomorphs, particularly those that reflect the existence of\na gateway or portal between worlds. La Venta Altar 4, for example, had an earthly purpose as a\nthrone and a symbolic one as a cosmological model. When the Olmec ruler sat on the throne he\ncould be present in both the natural and supernatural realms. This journey between worlds was\naided by the intercession of the ruler\u2019s animal spirit companion (in this case a jaguar).9\nThe Olmec undoubtedly left a lasting legacy on the Caribbean coast of Mesoamerica, but the\nlegacy can be difficult to trace, as much of it has been subsumed into a debate about its being\na \u201cmother\u201d culture for the Aztec and Maya. (Recent scholarship has given less credence to the\n8 F. Kent Reilly III, \u201cArt, Ritual and Rulership in the Olmec World,\u201d In Smith and Masson, eds., 374.\n9 Ibid., 393.\nPage | 375 Olmec as a \u201cmother culture\u201d and argues that it developed independently of Maya and Valley\nof Mexico cultures). Hopefully as scholars and students examine the Olmec as an independent\ncultural entity, its legacy will continue to become clearer.\n10.6 THE MAYA\nThe importance of the influence of the Olmec on the Maya may seem superficial, but it is quite\nimportant, as the Maya\u2019s rise to sophistication was so fast and so complete that it almost defies\nexplanation. After settling at the base of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula around 1000 BCE, the lowland\nMaya learned how to deal with drought, feed tens of thousands of people, and organize political-\nly\u2014all before 250 BCE.\nThe Late Classic period was one of tremendous growth. The city of Tikal, in present day\nGuatemala, had reached a population of 80,000 by CE 750, while the population of its rival\nCalakmul reached 50,000. To support these large populations, the Late Classic Maya had almost a\ntotally engineered landscape that included water management projects, flattened ridge tops, and\nterraced hillsides. The population was fairly dense in cities and in surrounding countryside. Their\nleaders had tombs built in their honor, imported luxury items like jade statues, feathers, cacao,\nand other items from the Mexican Highlands. These activities all demonstrate real sophistication.\nThe Late Classic Maya also had an advanced numerical annotation system of dots and bars\nand used zero. Maya writing began as pictographs and\nblended into quite artistic symbolism. In addition to\ntheir more than seven hundred carved monuments, the\nMaya culture produced wooden carvings, incised jades,\nand pottery.\nPolitically speaking, the Maya were never unified\nunder one ruler or even a set of rulers. Instead, the Maya\nwere a civilization that shared a set of cultural traits, a\nlanguage family, but no single ruler or sense of common\nidentity. Individual Maya Kingdoms rose and fell, but\nnone was ever able to dominate the entire Maya area.\nWhile their rule was perhaps not widespread, Maya\nrulers did hold tremendous power and prestige within\ntheir kingdoms. Rulers were kings at the top of a \u201csteep\u201d\nsocial hierarchy that was reinforced by religious beliefs.\nThe king was a hereditary ruler chosen by the gods and\na member of one of several elite bloodlines. The Maya\npriestly class organized a complex pantheon of both\nFigure 10.2 | Mayan Stela | Stela with\ngods and deified ancestors.\nMayan Script, Anthropological Museum in\nThis ancestor worship required not only ceremony Mexico City.\nand temple building, but a complex understanding Author: User \u201cWicki\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nof calendrics as well. Both the Maya and the Olmec\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 376 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\nunderstood time as \u201ca set of repeating and interlocking cycles instead of the linear sequence of\nhistorical time,\u201d10 much as the concept is understood today. Long cycles alternated with short\ncycles; the long periods involved the repeated creations and destructions of the world in their\ncreation stories\u2014with an emphasis on repeated. Since cycles are by definition repeated, certain\ndates are more important than others because they are attached to good and bad events in the\npast. Calendar priests determined what those dates were and so had considerable power. They\nalso had the power to rewrite the course of events if this benefited the ruler. 11\n10.6.1 Teotihuac\u00e1n and the Toltec\nWhile the Olmec and Maya accomplished incredible things, urbanization to the north in\nMexico\u2019s central valley may have left the most permanent legacy. To the north of the Maya culture\narea, the Valley of Mexico was the most \u201cagriculturally desirable\u201d zone in Mesoamerica. Climate\nwas temperate, and rainfall, although not abundant, was predictable\u2014in contrast to the drenching\nrains of tropical Mesoamerica. Lesser amounts of rainfall of course required aqueducts, reservoirs,\nand canals if a city were to thrive. Cuicuilco was such a city that rose to prominence in the Valley\nof Mexico by 150 BCE, only to be badly damaged by a volcanic eruption around 400 CE. The\nsubsequent decline of Cuicuilco allowed a competing city, Teotihuac\u00e1n, to rise to prominence in\nthe area, and by 100 CE, its population reached 60,000 inhabitants. By 550 CE, Teotihuac\u00e1n was\none of the six largest cities in the world, with a population of 125,000. Teotihuac\u00e1n covered more\nthan 20 square kilometers, had a marketplace, an administrative center and several different\ntypes of housing. Its largest buildings seem to have had both a functional and a spiritual use. The\nPyramid of the Sun, the largest building in the city was built over a sacred cave likely connected\nwith creation myths. By the fourth century CE, Teotihuac\u00e1n had the modern equivalent of neigh-\nborhoods; new houses were laid out on a rough grid with many homes organized into apartment\ncompounds.12 The dwellings were constructed of volcanic rock, mortar, and wood for the roofs.\nThe compounds also had a system of underfloor drains. Many of the dwellings in these complexes\nare decorated with \u201cpolychrome wall murals\u201d containing multiple religious themes and military\nthemes, some depicting play or everyday life, while others being much more abstract.13\nTo support its massive population, Teotihuac\u00e1n needed to secure supplies and tribute from\nsurrounding areas. Many neighboring areas were conquered through a combination of trade\nand military conquest. Force was used to secure trade routes to the south and thus have access\nto goods as diverse as cacao beans, tropical bird feathers, salt, medicinal herbs, and honey.\nOnce the city\u2019s influence had expanded and they had become the region\u2019s undisputed merchant\npower, its subsistence base increased to include the entire Basin of Mexico and some neigh-\nboring peoples like Tlazcala. The reach of Teotihuac\u00e1n\u2019s leadership even extended into Maya\nkingdoms like Tikal where it influenced, and may have even ousted, a Maya ruler in the late\n10 Matthew Restall and Amara Solari, 2012 and the End of the World: The Western Roots of the Maya Apocalypse. (Lanham,\nMD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2011).\n11 Ibid.\n12 Adams, 46-49.\n13 Ibid.\nPage | 377 fourth century. Tikal\u2019s position within its own region may in fact have been strengthened by this\nsubordination to Teotihuac\u00e1n.14\nTeotihuac\u00e1n was able to sustain impressive growth and expansion for more than five\ncenturies, but ultimately its size and complexity seemingly contributed to its decline. At about\n650 CE, roughly half of Teotihuac\u00e1n\u2019s public buildings and a number of temples, pyramids, and\npalaces were burned. Many were knocked down and torn apart as well. This does not seem to be\nthe work of invaders, but instead internal and external groups who attacked declining symbols\nof power.\nThe Late Classic Maya would also experience a collapse of their cultural systems around 840\nCE. Years of population growth and demands on and from the elite came to a head with a period of\nprolonged drought in the early ninth century. Resulting famines and infighting caused population\nlosses in Maya settlements nearing eighty-five percent and in many areas abandoned farmlands\nwere retaken by the forest.15\nWhile many of these Late Classic Maya sites would never recover from their demographic\ndecline, Mesoamerica remained fertile and southern Mexico remained temperate, so a number of\npolities rose to prominence in the area after the abovementioned declines. Tula, which had been\nfounded by Teotihuac\u00e1n leaders as an administrative center, emerged in the Valley of Mexico\nafter 650 CE. Tula would become the capital of the Toltecs, who saw their principal city grow to\na population of 35,000 by 800 CE. Like all Mesoamerican cities at the time, Tula would expand\nits influence through trade. Toltec ceramics were found in regions ranging from Costa Rica to\nGuatemala; while Toltec style I-shaped ball courts and rain dances were adopted by cultures like\nthe Anasazi and Hohokam in modern day Arizona and New Mexico. One of these ball courts still\nsits near the modern city of Phoenix, Arizona.16 While much of the Hohokam culture area sits in\nwhat is now the United States, it was heavily influenced by the culture of Mexico. Not only did\nthe Hohokam build ball courts, they also erected platform mounds and dug irrigation canals like\nthose found in Mexico.\nOne important difference that the Toltec developed from their predecessors was their\ndesire to conquer. Perhaps influenced by the rapid decline of Teotihuac\u00e1n, the Toltec wanted\nto rise to prominence quickly. Their construction of Tula was hasty and conflict with neighbors\nwent beyond typical captive taking or territorial gain. The Toltec viewed their conquest as a\n\u201csacred war\u201d where man would aid the gods in their fight against the powers of darkness. The\nToltec eventually merged their sacred war with that of the northern Maya in the Puuc Hills\nof the Yucat\u00e1n. The northern Maya elites had already adopted \u201cdivine war\u201d when the Toltec\ninvaded the Yucat\u00e1n city of Chich\u00e9n. Chich\u00e9n would become the Toltec administrative center\nin the peninsula in the late tenth century but they did not completely drive out the city\u2019s Maya\nfounders. In fact, the Itza Maya ruled the region under the Toltec and continued to do so well\ninto the post-Columbian period.17\n14 Adams, 48-49.\n15 Ibid., 60-65.\n16 Ibid., 69-71.\n17 Ibid., 69-75.\nPage | 378 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\n10.7 THE AZTEC\nWhile the Itza were one of the last unconquered native civilizations in the New World, another\npost-classic kingdom drew the most attention from Mexico\u2019s Spanish conquerors: the Aztec. The\nAztec capital was the magnificent city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, founded around 1325 CE by a Nahuatl-\nspeaking, previously nomadic group called the Mexica. Tenochtitl\u00e1n was composed of a network\nof dozens of smaller city states who used the lake environment to plant wetland gardens and\nused raised causeways to separate the gardens and move around the city. Some fields were raised\nas well, a feat which drained them and helped them contribute to supporting a population that\ntotaled around 300,000 people (including the population of the neighboring city of Texcoco).\nEventually a network of canals was created that drained fields, fed crops, and provided for navi-\ngation with canoes. Not only were these raised fields a source of multiple crops, but also the lake\nprovided wildfowl, salamanders, and algae.\nHowever, as the population grew to over a million, other means of support were needed, so\nthe people looked to outside tribute. Beginning in 1428, the Mexica sought independence from\ntheir Tepanec patrons and allied with other outlying towns to form the Triple Alliance, which\nFigure 10.2 | Map of Tenochtitl\u00e1n and Gulf of Mexico | Drawn by member of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s expedition, 1524.\nAuthor: User \u201cLupo\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 379 by 1431 dominated the basin\nwhere they made their home.\nThe unified Aztec people were\nled by the Mexica ruler Itzcoatl\nand his advisors. In making an\nalliance with Texcoco, the Aztec\nwere able to build a causeway\nbetween the cities and help\nimprove the infrastructure of\nTenochtitl\u00e1n. They then began\nconstruction on the Great\nTemple, a central market, and\na larger network of gardens or\nchinampas. The Great Temple\nMap 10.3 | Mesoamerican Historical Sites\nwould become the orienting\nAuthor: User \u201cP Miles\u201d\npoint for the entire city and Source: Wikimedia Commons\nwould become the site of License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nthousands of human sacrifices.\nThe Aztec are perhaps best known, and may even have grown infamous (like the Toltec and\nothers before them), for practicing human sacrifice. However, the context in which these sacri-\nfices take place reveals that they were not conducted in a wanton or random manner. First of all,\nfor the new Aztecs, there was little tradition of and, therefore, little opportunity for community\nbuilding to draw upon. Their rise to power had to have been quick and dramatic. Furthermore,\nthey possessed a worldview that held that even though they had achieved greatness, decline was\ninevitable. This view was present in their philosophy and their ceremonies\u2014including those of\nsacrifice. This view was also important for ritual victims, because upon their death, they believed\nthat they would be freed from the burdens of the uncertain human condition and become a\ncarefree hummingbird or butterfly.\nFor the Aztec, ritual provided a kind of protection against excess; there was order in it, even\nif it was violent. Men had no independent power, and gods were very abstract in their doling\nout of gifts. Finally, in the Mexica worldview, the earth receives rather than gives, much like it\ndoes in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Through fertility and death, humans satisfy that hunger.\nThe process of birth and death is not \u201cdust to dust\u201d but the transition from one form of flesh to\nanother. All man can do is order his portion of this natural cycle.\n10.8 EARLY ANDES\nHumans arrived in South America after migrating through North and Mesoamerica; they\nbegan to craft small campsites and fishing villages along the Pacific coast. Around 3,000 BCE, the\nsmall campsites villages were replaced by residential and ceremonial centers. This transition was\nmade possible through a new focus on irrigation and communal agriculture.\nPage | 380 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\nThese Pacific coast and Andean cultures left an incredible amount of material culture (much\nof it well-preserved because of the dry climate) for archeologists to analyze. Their work shows that\nparts of the Classical Andes\u2014modern Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Colombia\u2014possessed the\nsame level of cultural complexity as did China, Persia, and India during the same period. Through\nthis material culture, the Classical peoples begin to separate themselves from their ancient and\noften less complex ancestors.\nWhile it is tempting to lean heavily on artifacts for knowledge of the period, there is a danger\nof overreliance. For example, pottery of the Moche culture (see Figure 10.3) is well known for its\noften quite graphic images of female fertility and sexuality. These pieces are important works\nfor archaeologists and historians alike, but one must keep in mind that little is known about\nhow much these representations of Moche female sexuality in art actually tell us about gender\nrelationships in their society. In other words, \u201cshock value\u201d or aesthetic quality should not be\nconfused with universality.\nThis section begins with the end of the archaic period and the rise of a group of civilizations\nreferred to as the Norte Chico.\n10.8.1 Norte Chico\nThe Pacific coast developed large ceremonial and residential centers, which were organized\naround distinct status and rank among citizens. This area resembles other \u201ccrucible\u201d areas like\nthe Deh Luran Plain of Iraq, the Nile in Egypt, and the Olmec heartland. While similarities with\nthe aforementioned early civilizations exist, the Norte Chico stands out for three reasons. First,\nit was politically \u201cpristine.\u201d Scholars find no evidence that any outside polity influenced its de-\nvelopment. Second, it endured for more than 1,300 years. This longevity gave the Norte Chico\ngreat influence in what would ultimately become a distinct Andean civilization. For example,\nlarge platform mounds of Norte Chico would also appear later in the highland center of Chav\u00edn\nde Huantar. The final reason Norte Chico stands out from other early civilizations is its devel-\nopment happened very quickly. By 2800 BCE, there were a number of similar large sites all with\nresidential complexes, plazas, and platform mounds.18\nThe Aspero site is the archetype of these large sites. It covers fifteen hectares and contains\nsix platform mounds. While there are a number of large sites like Aspero, there doesn\u2019t seem\nto have been a central Norte Chico chiefdom or state. There was no Norte Chico capital and\nno real evidence of conflict or warfare. This absence of conflict may be connected with the fact\nthat scholars find no indication of differentially-distributed sumptuary goods, such as jewelry,\nclothing, and exotic trade materials, in Norte Chico. Even shell beads and stone are extremely rare\nto find in these sites so near to the Pacific.\nUsually a cultural area requires some centralization and large scale agriculture before scholars\nrefer to it as a civilization. The Norte Chico earns that distinction, however, because the level of\ncultural complexity indicates that they at least tried to centralize. Complexity is tricky. In the Norte\n18 Jonathan Haas and Winifred Creamer, \u201cCrucible of Andean Civilization: The Peruvian Coast from 3000 to 1800 BC\u201d\nCurrent Anthropology 47:5: October 2006, 746.\nPage | 381 Chico, there occurred episodic attempts at non-egal-\nitarianism which were eventually abandoned. Many\nscholars also argue that Norte Chico did in fact\nbecome sophisticated and sedentary, not through\nagriculture but through fishing; this argument is\nknown as the maritime theory. While unique, the\nmaritime theory has trouble supporting the idea that\nthe Norte Chico advanced merely through fishing,\nas insufficient archaeological evidence of communal\nlabor sites centered on fishing exists to support it.\nInstead, a more likely explanation of Norte Chico\ncomplexity involves agriculture and fishing meeting\nat the middle, in a \u201cshared labor\u201d theory. A number\nof coastal sites contain not only remnants of cotton\nfishing nets, but other inland products like avocadoes\nand corn as well. These remnants mean that the canal\nbuilding that took place between 4,000 and 3,000\nMap 10.4 | Map of Peru Site Locations | BCE in the interior was likely only possible with the\nArcheological Site Locations Within Peru, assistance of the coast\u2019s more plentiful labor force.\nincluding El Paraiso, Caral, and Aspero\nThis assistance was paid for with cotton nets and\nAuthor: User \u201cOntrvet\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons other agricultural products that in turn helped the\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 coastal population feed itself and grow year after year.\nA larger temporary labor force would produce more\ncanals and aqueducts, a cycle that explains much of the Norte Chico\u2019s economic expansion. Some\nof this cooperation may have even taken the form of pilgrimages to Norte Chico sites and the\nconstruction of monuments within Aspero, Caral, and other sites to commemorate them. The dry\nseason of July and August presented a lull that would have been a good time for such pilgrimages.\nEvidence of communal cooking and eating exists, along with that of communal building.\n10.8.2 Chav\u00edn de Huantar\nWhile the Norte Chico is the oldest identifiable civilization along the Pacific Coast, Chav\u00edn\nde Huantar has also captured much attention as a crucible site for Andean culture. Chav\u00edn de\nHuantar is the iconic representation of The Late Initial Period (1800 \u2013 800 BCE), where Peru\nsaw the beginnings of a mix of Andean, coastal, and Amazon cultures. Chav\u00edn is located at an\naltitude of more than 3,000 meters in the Callejon de Conchucos, the easternmost basin between\nthe Cordilleras Negra and Blanca in the Peruvian Andes. It is also midway between the coast and\njungle, giving it access to the culture and resources of the greater Andean region. This access made\nit a pilgrimage center, an importer of luxury goods, and a disseminator first unifying Andean style.19\nChav\u00edn\u2019s \u201cOld Temple\u201d is 330 feet across the back and more than fifty feet high at its highest.

The temple is also built\naround the lanz\u00f3n (great lance) which was a\nkind of supernatural conduit. The lanz\u00f3n is\nsimilar in style to the Tello Obelisk which was\nfound in a corner of the Old Temple courtyard.\nThe obelisk contains carvings on all of its sides,\ncarvings which primarily represent tropical\nand mythical origins or \u201cgifts of the cayman.\u201d20\nMany dualities appear on the obelisk: male-fe-\nmale, plant type, ecological zone, sky-water, life-\ndeath, etc. These dualities and their meaning\nwere reinforced by the pilgrimages made to\nChav\u00edn and the ceremonies contained within\nthem. It seems that Chav\u00edn architects used all\nof the symbolic value of the site available to\nthem. The mixed human-animal features of the Map 10.5 | Map of Chavin Culture Extent\nAuthor: User \u201cRoarjo\u201d\nsculptures, the ingestion of hallucinogenic San\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nPedro cactus (also represented in sculpture), License: Public Domain\nand even including acoustic symbolism were\nall important parts of the pilgrimages. Archaeologists have found marine shell trumpets in the\ntunnel complex under the city and have attempted to replicate how sound would contribute to the\nmind-altering rituals undertaken at the complex.21\nThe images and rituals at this site help establish what scholars refer to as the \u201cChav\u00edn cult.\u201d22\nThe Chav\u00edn cult presents a universalist message based on the combined elements of coast and\nhighlands that helped bring people to sites like this for ceremony and construction. In other\nwords, these ideas helped move the Andes into the state phase. At Chav\u00edn, it also seems that\nthere was a leader/priest, like in Egypt. It was, therefore, through spiritual power that the state\ncongealed and grew, as well.23\n10.8.3 Moche\nChav\u00edn de Huantar was not a developed civilization, but it did help create the importance of\nreligion and ceremonial life in the Andes, both in every day practice and in sacred sites. Later, other\ngroups in Peru, groups like the Moche, would build on religion and ceremony to help with state\nformation. The Moche began to conquer the North coast valleys in 200 BCE and, by 250 CE, had\nbegun to construct the Huaca del Sol or temple of the sun and the Huaca de la Luna or temple\n20 Rebecca R. Stone, Art of the Andes: From Chavin to Inca: 3rd ed. (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2012).\n21 Ibid.\n22 Ibid.\n23 Ibid.\nPage | 383 of the moon at their capital, which bore the same name. The Huaca del Sol seems to have been a\nroyal residence and the Huaca de la Luna a place of worship. The Huaca del Sol contained over 143\nmillion bricks, arranged into columns and marked with symbols perhaps of who made them.24 Each\ncolumn probably represented a tax-paying Ayllu (kinship-based community), meaning that the\nHuaca or temple was a literal representation of how the empire was held up by its individual units.\nThere is still some debate about how much centralization there was at the upper echelons of\nMoche politics, but there was undoubtedly a leadership class with several administrative levels. The\nfirst administrative level was that of the divine kings who are depicted in murals and ceramics from\nthis period. The second was of noble administrators. Below that were bureaucrats who organized\nthe already extant clan system. Below them were the long-standing clan leaders. The lowest level\nwas composed of commoners, many of whom lived in single story adobe houses. Most commoners\nmastered some craft like metallurgy or weaving. Others were highly skilled and perhaps worked\nexclusively for the rulers.\nResidents living outside of the capital were almost exclu-\nsively farmers who lived along the Moche\u2019s extensive irrigation\ncanals\u2014in the Chicama Valley, there is a 120 km long canal still\nin use today. The Moche found a very practical application of\nthe previously mentioned coastal-mountain symbiosis through\nthe llama. The llama is a domesticated mountain pack animal\nthat the Moche used to journey to the coast and gather guano at\nthe Chincha Islands for fertilizing their valley farms.\nBy 600 CE, the city of Moche covered an area of a square\nkilometer and probably had a population of 15,000. Each\nconquered valley outside of the capital had its own huaca, and\neach one was connected to Moche by relay runners who carried\nmessages written in the form of lines and dots on Lima beans.\nPerhaps the most notable Moche legacy was their art. Their\nbuildings, their murals, and their pottery alike reflected their\ngreat skill and the high level of societal stratification. The Huaca\ndel Sol at Cerro Blanco for example contained millions of bricks\nand more than 100 types of geometric symbols. Moche murals Figure 10.3 | Stirrup-spout\ncontained a unique series of squares depicting both abstract and Vessel, Peru North Coast,\nMoche Culture, 100-500 CE\nmythological concepts involving themes of creation, combat,\nAuthor: Unknown\nsacrifice, and men-jaguars. As already mentioned, this sacrifice Source: Wikimedia Commons\nmay not have always been violent, may not have been literal, License: Public Domain\nand always has a functional explanation. In this case, sacrifice is\ndesigned to terrify or at the very least impress a subject population. While it is important to con-\ntextualize this sacrifice, we must also remind ourselves that this is not a modern civilization with a\nmiddle class or even a democratic tradition. It was archaic in the sense that a small group of people\nwas supported by a large population underneath them. This kind of relationship required brutality.\n24 Adams, 106.\nPage | 384 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\n10.8.4 Huari\nWhile the Moche were notable because of their art and material culture, their use of violence\nto achieve and hold power threatens to cloud our image of the north coast peoples. The Huari, on\nthe other hand, were able to build a successful empire in nearby areas combining intimidation and\nmilitarism with diplomacy, trade, and ideology.\nThe Huari ruled over more territory than any\nprevious Andean polity, partially by coopting\nneighboring groups through taxation, distribu-\ntion of goods, feasting and religious ceremonies.\nThere is also evidence that the Huari used sacred\nmummy bundles or trophy heads to incorporate\noutgroups and maintain a ritual relationship with\nthese outgroups. Huari textiles and ceramics were\nfound far from the capital, and Huari architecture\nwas highly influential throughout the region.25 The\nHuari Empire carved out a centralized state in a\nregion where none had previously existed by coor-\ndinating local irrigation and labor systems. By 700\nCE, Huari maintained a population of 25,000 and\nan over 700 kilometer-wide \u201czone of influence\u201d\nconnected by a road network that may have been\nthe model for the Inca road system. In fact, it was\nultimately Huari diplomacy and organization,\nrather than Moche violence in ritual killings, that\nprovided a more useful precedent for the Inca.26\n10.8.5 Chimu\nThe Chimu Kingdom was perhaps influ-\nenced more directly by remnants of the Moche,\noccupying as they did more or less the same geo-\ngraphic area. The Chimu capital of Chan Chan\nwas established at about 1000 CE. Through their\nMap 10.6 | Map of Huari-With-Tiahuanaco\nsystem of split inheritance, the Chimu forced the\nAuthor: User \u201cHuhsunqu\u201d\nnewly-ascended ruler to build his own material Source: Wikimedia Commons\nwealth. This expectation meant conquest of new License: Public Domain\nterritory and an increase in taxes. It also meant\nthe construction of a new palace where each ruler would be buried along with hundreds of his\nattendants and llamas who were sacrificed to accompany him in the afterlife. A Chimu ruler was\n25 Tiffany Tung, Violence, Ritual, and the Wari Empire: Bioarchaeological Interpretations of the Human Past: Local, Region-\nal, and Global Perspectives (Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 2012), 24-25.\n26 Adams, 113.\nPage | 385 also buried with a sample of the wealth he had accumulated in his lifetime in the form of textiles,\nwood carvings, pottery, or jewelry. While earthquakes meant that the Chimu had to work hard to\nreclaim or make any use at all of Moche irrigation canals, they did manage to revive and extend\nthe Moche system to eventually provide Chan Chan with diverse agricultural products from maize\nto cotton to peanuts. The Chimu also employed violence in their rise to power; however, their\nconquest by the Inca cut short any means for scholars to see if they intended to follow or rather\neventually break from the Moche legacy.27\n10.8.6 South Coast peoples\nThe south coast of Peru developed somewhat distinctly because it is extremely arid. In certain\nareas along the coast there has never been recorded rain. Surviving there meant accessing and\ncontrolling Andean runoff that sometimes went underground. As a result, the south coast\u2019s popu-\nlation was much smaller, but in many ways was culturally richer.\nThe Nazca carved out their civilization along the south coast between 100 BCE to 600 CE.\nThere was a large center at Cahuachi as early as 200 BCE, but it was largely ceremonial rather\nthan residential. Forty huacas were also built in the areas surrounding Cahuachi but also were\nwithout large permanent populations. The Nazca maintained a regular pilgrimage to Cahuachi\ninvolving music, feasts, and fertility rites. There was some captive sacrifice, but it is not clear of\nwhom. Nazca leadership was probably a confederacy of clans, making the forty huacas the hubs of\npolitical and sacred activities. Huacas are further explained in section 10.8.8.\nThe Nazca are well known for their pottery and textiles. Their pottery depicted mythical feline\nor otter figures, many of which\nwere associated with water and\nfertility\u2014in this climate, water\nessentially is fertility. The same\nfigures are represented on the\nNazca lines/geoglyphs that were\ncreated by clearing the desert\nfloor of stone and leaving the\nmotifs. The straight lines were\nprobably \u201critual walkways.\u201d\nOthers argue that the Nazca\nLines were an astronomical\ncalendar centered around the\nagricultural cycle. Overall, the\nNazca had an impressive but\nFigure 10.4 | Nazca Lines Hummingbird\nbrief florescence which came to\nAuthor: Unukomo\nan abrupt end after a prolonged Source: Wikimedia Commons\ndrought in the 550s CE.28 License: CC BY-SA 3.0\n27 Adams, 114-116.\n28 Adams, 109.\nPage | 386 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\n10.8.7 Tiwanaku\nTiwanaku was a ceremonial\ncenter and administrative city\nnear Lake Titicaca established in\nthe fifth century CE. At its height,\nmore than 40,000 people lived in\nthe city itself; they were supported\nby a population of 365,000 in the\nsubjected outskirts. Surrounding\nfarmlands produced high crop\nyields with abundant quinoa and\npotatoes supported by meat and\nlegumes. They used canals, ridged\nFigure 10.5 | An Inca Quipu, from the Larco Museum in Lima\nfields, and raised fields, and they\nAuthor: Clause Ableiter\neven created a series of ditches Source: Wikimedia Commons\nthat created fog and prevented License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nfrost in the colder months.\nIn the city itself, several large platform mounds connected by causeways were used by the\nadministrators of this complex system. From subordinate colonies hundreds of miles away, they\nreceived corn, coca, tropical birds, and medicinal herbs. Many of these goods were carried by\nllamas. Alpacas also provided high grade wool for textiles.\nTiwanaku contained many ethnic and linguistic zones and \u201cvertically integrated\u201d many areas\nof the Andes for the first time. Tiwanaku was relatively stable until its downfall around 1,000\nCE, perhaps falling victim to its own success. Saline deposits from long term irrigation may have\nreduced the fertility of the soil, leaving Tiwanaku without its most distinct advantage.\nIn general, comparing these three more recent civilizations to the first civilizations of Norte\nChico reveals increased complexity in all cases with class structure developing, warfare, and\nreligion, even though their methods of survival were quite different.\n10.8.8 The Inca\nThe Huari and Tiwanaku built on local resources to construct their states. While the Inca are\nthe best known of these Andean civilizations, they began in the same way by building on the Ayllu\nkinship system.\nIn some ways, the Ayllu system was ready-made for empire. Ayllus were networks of families\nand individuals who traded in labor and subsistence and ritual activities.29 This system meant\nbuilt-in labor obligations existed, as did rules about marriage and ancestor worship. All of these\nrules were reinforced through ritual, allowing the Inca to build upon Ayllu rituals to increase his\npower, authority, and divine claim to the throne. Future Incas were only eligible to rule if they\ndescended from the royal allyu.\n29 Michael A. Malpass, Daily Life in the Inca Empire, 2nd ed. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2009), 32.\nPage | 387 After the Inca had established their legitimacy, their expansion would begin during the reign of\nPachacuti. By the time of his death in 1471, he conquered not only the Chanca and Quechua ethnic-\nities of the southern Andes, but also the coastal Chimu. Topa Inca continued his father\u2019s conquests;\nhe was succeeded by Huayna Capac. The Inca used Cuzco as their imperial capital, expanding it\naround several huacas into the shape of a puma. They also built the Sun Temple in honor of the god\nInti who was all-powerful, benevolent and from whom Inca rulers claimed to descend.\nNot only did the Ayllu help the empire take shape, but it also became its main administrative\nunits once it had expanded. Local Ayllu nobility reinforced their connection to the empire through\nthe mummification and consecration of ancestors. Mummies or other sacred bundles would\nbecome \u201chuacas,\u201d venerated in Cusco by Inca nobility to establish a sacred connection between\nlocal Ayllus and the empire. (See map for the connections between Cuzco and surrounding areas).\nLabor obligations were the primary form of taxation organized through the Ayllu and closely\nrecorded on quipus. Through Ayllu labor, the Inca were able to collect taxes, store and distribute\nfood, and build their road system. The Inca road system eventually covered over 5,500 kilometers,\nstretching from Ecuador to Chile. Counting all of the sub-systems, the roads covered brings that\namount closer to thirty-two thousand aggregate kilometers. The roads varied in sophistication\nand width, depending on conditions and need, but could include staircases, causeways, and\nsuspension bridges. This complexity had added elements of efficiency through the Inca network\nof messengers that would operate twen-\nty-four hours a day and carry a message\nfrom one location in the empire to another\nin a matter of a few days.\nThe Inca also used religion extensively\nto keep their empire strong. Each Ayllu\nhad a huaca connected to it with multiple\nmeanings, including as an origin point. The\nsun, on the other hand, was the royal pro-\ngenitor, and the temple Coricancha located\nin Cuzco was the most important temple\nto the sun. From Coricancha radiated\nforty-one sacred lines or ceques connected\nto 328 huacas in the Cuzco valley. Many\nhuacas were connected to water or rain,\ngiving a sacred importance to some drains,\nfountains, baths, and libations.\nAn empire of this size would not have\nbeen possible without an effective army\nas well. Inca arms reflected the landscape.\nTheir armor was light, they used lots of pro- Map 10.7 | Map of the Four Suyus of the Inca Empire\nAuthor: User \u201cEuroHistoryTeacher\u201d\njectiles, and they protected their fortresses\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nwith boulders that could be rolled down hills. License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 388 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\nAll these defenses used the advantages the mountains offered. Some archers were even recruited\nfrom the Amazon. Their strength was in their combination of mobility and superior numbers. There\nwas very little siege tradition; battles would commence as soon as the armies arrived.\nAll empires would collect taxes, have armies, and build temples. The Inca were so successful, it\nseems, because they considered the most fundamental elements of Andean culture to strengthen\ntheir hold on power. Pre-Inca Andean society was a uniquely parallel one in which both men and\nwomen were important contributors to Andean religious, economic, and political life. In forming\ntheir empire, the Inca were very cognizant of Andean understanding of gender. To garner the\nsupport of the female sphere (some scholars say to undermine it), the Incas created a revered\nclass of aclla women; these were attractive girls who would represent their newly conquered\nhome Ayllu as elites of the glorious Inca Empire. These \u201cchosen women\u201d not only solidified Inca\nimperial bonds through marriage, converting a political entity into a family, but also expanded\nInca religious legitimacy when a chosen few were periodically sacrificed and converted into the\n\u201cdivine custodians\u201d of their communities.\n10.8.9 Machu Picchu\nNestled in the Peruvian Andes, Machu Picchu is undoubtedly the most well-known Inca site\nby modern tourists. The site is located at 8,000 feet above sea level, in a forested area. It is framed\nby the Urubamba River and sits on a ridge between two peaks. The site itself must have been\nspectacular before construction began, but the complex itself is nothing short of extraordinary.30\nDespite its iconic status, much less\nis known about its fifteenth century role.\nIts construction seems to have been\nordered by Pachacuti, who used it as a\nroyal retreat of sorts from Cuzco. The\nmost attractive time for travel would\nhave been during the winter when\nMachu Picchu was much warmer than\nCuzco. There is evidence of the same\nskilled craftspeople and retainers that\naccompanied the Inca in Cuzco main-\ntaining a presence in Machu Picchu as\nwell. Macchu Picchu did have tracts of\nsurrounding land to feed the court, the\nemperor, and visiting dignitaries, and\nFigure 10.6 | Peru Machu Picchu at Sunrise to supply the ceremonies connected\nAuthor: Allard Schmidt\nwith their arrival. However, this was\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain not a city. Only a few year-round\nresidents inhabited it, and even at its\n30 Ibid., 108-09.\nPage | 389 seasonal height, the population only reached about 750. There are agricultural terraces which\ngrew potatoes and maize, and a spring for bathing and drinking that was connected by aqueducts\nto a fountain between the Temple of the Sun and the residences. There are one hundred and\nseventy-two structures at the site in total, including residences for the Inca\u2019s elite retinue and\nsmaller dwellings for the servants. Also thirty buildings are dedicated to ceremonial purposes,\nincluding the Temple of the Three Windows; the Intihuatana, an oblong rock at the head of a large\nstaircase; and The Temple of the Condor. The construction is not only visually impressive, but\nalso structural engineers have remarked at its sophisticated drainage and foundation work that\nhave allowed it to stand mostly intact for more than 500 years31.\n10.9 NORTH AMERICA\nWhile most evidence points to human migration through North America to South America, the\nhallmarks of civilization would arrive later in what are now the United States and Canada. Many\nof us refer to the areas connected by Panama simply as \u201cThe Americas,\u201d but the Panamanian land\nbridge first linked the two continents only two million years ago. This was prior to human arrival\nin the Americas, but this separate development meant that North and South American flora and\nfauna experienced millions of years of separate development and evolution. This distinct devel-\nopment would influence the pace and patterns of human settlement in the Americas a great deal.\n10.9.1 The West\nThe arrival of maize, beans, and squash from northern Mexico helped mark the transition to\nsedentary culture in the Southwest of what is now the United States. There is some evidence of\nprimitive maize dating back to the middle of the second millennium BCE, but it would not become\nwidespread until about 1000 BCE. A newer, drastically different maize, \u201cMaiz de Ocho,\u201d is\nbelieved to have been the key to the flourishing of sedentary villages across the Southwest and to\nthe eventual appearance of large pithouse villages around 500 BCE. Maiz de Ocho is better suited\nto arid conditions and yields larger kernels which are more easily milled. Pithouses, dwellings\nwhose name indicates that its walls were in fact the sides of an excavated pit, became widespread\nacross the Southwest because they were \u201cthermally efficient.\u201d They lost less heat than aboveground\nstructures in winter and, as they were built into the ground, were cooler in the summer. Pithouses\nremained in wide use in the area until about 700 CE, when more complex exchange networks and\nsocial organization led to more diverse settlement patterns.32\nOne of these new settlement patterns was the \u201cgreat pueblo\u201d that appeared as part of the \u201cChaco\nPhenomenon\u201d around 900 CE. To deal with unpredictable summer rainfall, the Chaco Anasazi\npeople of New Mexico built three \u201cgreat houses\u201d\u2014Pe\u00f1asco Blanco, Pueblo Bonito, and Una Vida,\u201d\na large structure situated at natural drainage junctions. The semi-circular town of Pueblo Bonito\ngrew out of a pithouse village to eventually form a semi-circular network of more than 600 rooms\nand reached a height of five stories along the canyon\u2019s rear wall. The complex\u2019s walls were built of\n31 Ibid., 112-114.\n32 Brian M. Fagan, Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent, 3rd ed. (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2000), 306.\nPage | 390 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\nsandstone blocks whose surfaces and cracks were smoothed and shored up by a clay-sand mortar.\nConstruction of the high ceilings also involved complicated ashlar masonry patterns that could be\ncovered with \u201cadobe plaster or matting.\u201d33\nEach of the larger Chaco Canyon sites also had at least\none great kiva. Kivas were subterranean gathering places\nwhich were used by individual kin groups for work, for\neducation, and for ceremonies. Larger kivas were gathering\nplaces for more formal ceremonies where political decisions\naffecting the entire community were often made.\nBy 1050 CE, five great pueblos in Chaco Canyon\nsupported a total population of around 5,000 people.\nWhile most lived within the relatively compact canyon\narea, the influence of this populace reached well beyond\nthe immediate pueblo complex. Evidence indicates that\nthe Chaco Canyon people may have had exclusive access\nto sources of turquoise all over New Mexico and used\nthe stone in their workshops where they produced vases,\nhuman effigy vessels, incense burners, bells, trumpets\nand painted tables. By the early twelfth century, Chaco Figure 10.7 | Chaco Canyon Pureblo\nBonita Doorways\nCanyon\u2019s influence extended to much of northwest New\nAuthor: User \u201cSaravask\u201d\nMexico and southern Colorado, where more than seventy Source: Wikimedia Commons\noutlying sites contained kivas, Chaco pottery, and similar License: Public Domain\narchitecture to what was found in Pueblo Bonito. The\nChaco also developed a road system that may have been for the distribution of resources or pil-\ngrimages. Either way, the road construction involved considerable cooperation to craft, at different\nstages, stairways and ramps carved out of bedrock and other pathways lined with boulders. After\n1130 CE, drought and growing population densities led to a 100-year decline of the Chaco sites.\nBy the 1200s most of the pueblos of the Chaco system were empty, their population dispersed and\naway from the canyon.34 While this was the height of Anasazi village life, they continued to thrive\nculturally and are recognized as the precursors of the modern Pueblo peoples.\n10.9.2 The Pacific coast\nFurther west, cultures along North America\u2019s Pacific coast were also sedentary, but did not\nderive their existence from farming. Instead, multiple Pacific coast cultures took advantage of\nabundant ocean resources, such as various fish species, sea mammals, timber, shellfish, waterfowl,\ngame, and wild plants. The abundance of these resources often suggests that coastal cultures were\nless complex than their contemporaries in the interior, but the ravages of climate required tremen-\ndous adaptation over time. During the Late Holocene period alone, from 2000 BCE to the present,\nperiodic colder episodes may have led to consequences as disparate as lakeside flooding, lowering\n33 Ibid., 301.\n34 Ibid., 323-329.\nPage | 391 of tree lines, drought, and a reduction of available marsh areas. Northwestern Coastal peoples, for\nexample, addressed this volatility by never putting their eggs in one basket. While they may have\nprimarily eaten acorns or salmon, they made sure to always maintain a secondary food source.\nFurther south, the Chumash, a people inhabiting the central and southern California coast,\ndeveloped ceremonial centers, provinces incorporating several villages, sophisticated \u201cwatercraft,\u201d\nand vibrant trade with the interior. In fact, this trade helped the Chumash avoid scarcities as well.35\n10.9.3 The Plains\nThe Great Plains represented perhaps the largest area of pre-Columbian North America, but it\nis also one of the least understood. The Wild West shows of the nineteenth century produced the\nlasting yet erroneous impression that the Plains Indian culture remained unchanged for centuries.\nBig game hunters in the Clovis Culture first inhabited the area as early as 13,000 years ago. As big\ngame became extinct around 9000 BCE, Paleo-Indian groups on the plains turned to foraging and\nfishing in river valleys and to hunting of primarily bison as well as deer and fowl. By 9000 BCE,\nthe Ice Age had left behind a vast expanse of \u201carid grassland\u201d from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico,\nan expanse known as the \u201cGreat\nBison Belt.\u201d Long before European\nexplorers introduced horses, people\non the Great Plains had developed so-\nphisticated processes of hunting bison\non foot that involved some hunters\ndisguised as bison, others orches-\ntrating movements among hunting\ngroups, and others shouting to drive\nthe bison toward pre-selected \u201ctraps\u201d\nor \u201cjumps.\u201d Dozens of bison would fall\nover a precipice to their deaths.

Findings at the\nOlsen-Chubbock site in Colorado indicate that by 6500 BCE, Paleo-Indians had also begun to\nbutcher seventy-five percent of the animals they killed, which could sustain a group of 100 people\nfor more than a month.36 Early Plains Archaic (5600 \u2013 3000 BCE) activity, while still largely\ndependent on bison, shows some increasing reliance on fish, fowl, and berries, possibly indicating\nwarmer and drier conditions that \u201cdiminished grass cover throughout the Central Plains.\u201d Middle\nPlains Archaic peoples (2900 BCE to 1000 BCE) adapted their bison hunting to allow for a more\nsedentary existence, returning to the same hunting ground year after year, and making much of\n35 Ibid., 222, 248.\n36 Ibid., 93-96.\nPage | 392 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\nthe bison meat into pemmican (a brick of pounded flesh and fat), that could be stored for seasons\nwhen bison were less plentiful (Fagan 123). By 550 CE, the Late Plains Archaic people had fully\nincorporated the bow and arrow into their hunts, which tended to be less frequent but more pro-\nductive, often incorporating \u201cmass kill sites\u201d that were used for hundreds of years in some cases.37\n10.9.4 The Eastern Woodlands\nThe term \u2018Middle Woodland\u2019 is occasionally used to refer the period between 200 BCE and CE\n400; this coincided with the influence of the Hopewell culture over much of eastern North America.\nPrevious to the Hopewell ascendance, the Adena people built hundreds of burial mounds in and\naround central Ohio (2300 \u2013 2100 BCE). Accompanying the burials were dozens of types of \u201cgrave\ngoods\u201d including spear points, stone pipes, and sculptures of animals and human hands. Hopewell\nmound building (1000 \u2013 200 BCE) and culture as a whole certainly had antecedents in the Adena\nand early Woodland cultures as a whole, but the Hopewell tradition stands out in its grandiosity.\nWith their center in the Ohio Valley, the Hopewell created hundreds of hectares of earthworks with\nregionally specific styles of craftsmanship. Copper, shells, obsidian, and shark and alligator teeth\nwere all used to create personal adornments, containers, pipes, and figurines. Much of this artifact\ndiversity can be attributed to the size and vitality of the Hopewell exchange zone which extended\nacross much of eastern North America from Florida to the Great Lakes. While there is evidence that\nareas as far away as North Dakota participated in this exchange network, the so-called \u201ccore areas\u201d\nwere in the Mississippi, Illinois, Scioto, and Miami river valleys in Illinois and Ohio. As trade picked\nup, so did the ceremonial and political significance of the artifacts received by local leaders and ulti-\nmately included in burial mounds. Some artifacts were buried with their owners at death as symbols\nof their power in life. The expansion of ceremony through these objects also meant that many of\nthe Hopewellian centers shared physical characteristics such as both platform and conical mounds,\nstructures for cremation, and burial vaults. The local populations who participated in these cere-\nmonies seem to have lived near, but not in, the ceremonial centers themselves in single or multiple\nfamily households. Although close to other residents, Hopewell communities were scattered across\nthe area, subsisting through a mix of foraging and horticulture.38\n10.9.5 Cahokia\nOther North American mound builders established their center at Cahokia, across the Mississippi\nRiver from present day Saint Louis. Cahokia was inhabited from about 700 to 1400 CE. At its peak,\nthe city covered nearly six square miles and 10,000 to 20,000 people lived there. Over 120 mounds\nwere built over time, and most of the mounds were enlarged several times. Houses were arranged in\nrows and around open plazas, and agricultural fields were cultivated nearby. Other mound centers\nand communities were located in the contiguous \u201cAmerican Bottom\u201d region. Centralization and the\nbeginning of the Mississippian period happened around 1050 CE, and the transition to the Moorehead\nphase\u2014marked by decreasing mound building\u2014happened about 1200.39\n37 Ibid., 122-127.\n38 Ibid., 417-422.\n39 Mary Beth D. Trubitt, \u201cMound Building and Prestige Goods Exchange: Changing Strategies in the Cahokia Chiefdom,\u201d\nPage | 393 What scholars still don\u2019t know about Cahokia is why there was decreased mound building\nafter 1200, during the so-called Moorehead Phase. While scholars usually associate decreased\nconstruction with societal decline, recent scholarship suggests that the opposite may be true for\nCahokia. Instead of declining, Cahokia might have gone through a transition to a lesser focus on\nstaples and storage and greater focus toward prestige goods and economic power. Their decreased\nmound building may have coincided with their energy being more focused on controlling trade\nacross the Mississippian Southeast. Scholars see evidence of this shift with an increase in nonlocal\nraw materials and \u201cprestige goods\u201d at Cahokia during this period, such materials and goods as\nminerals, igneous rock for axeheads, ceramics, marine shell, quartz crystal, and copper.40\nFigure 10.8 | Monks Mound in July\nAuthor: User \u201cSkubasteve834\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nAmerican Antiquity 65:4 (Oct., 2000): 669-690\n40 Ibid.\nPage | 394 CHAPTER 10: THE AMERICAS\n10.9.6 The Arctic\nThe Arctic\u2019s harsh climate meant that it was one of the last areas in the Americas to be perma-\nnently settled. The first Paleo-Eskimo populations appeared around 4,000 years ago emanating\nfrom Eastern Siberia. They were left behind by the original American colonists. The Arctic colonists\nexpanded rapidly across Alaska, through Canada, and into Greenland as they all possessed arctic\nsmall tool kits including the important toggle headed harpoons to kill walrus and seal. In general,\ntheir evolution was from reindeer hunters to seal hunters, but both types of societies continued\nto exist side by side.\n10.10 CONCLUSION\nHumans migrated to the Americas by 15,000 BCE and perhaps as many as 3,000 years before.\nThe earliest recognizable civilizations in the Americas were in Mesoamerica and began during the\nArchaic period, ten thousand years ago. Farmers in Mesoamerica began to cultivate crops such\nas corn, squash, beans, chilies, manioc, and sweet potatoes. During Mesoamerica\u2019s more recent\nFormative Period, the rise of the Olmec Civilization occurred. They would be followed by several\nothers, most notably the Maya, and further to the north the Aztec Empire that was at its height\nwhen the Spanish arrived in 1519.\nAround 3,000 BCE, small campsites and fishing villages began to appear in Peru. These were\neventually replaced by more permanent structures and agriculture communities which would be\nthe antecedents to the incredibly complex cultures of the Classical Andes in Peru, Chile, Ecuador,\nBolivia, and Colombia. Among these Pacific Coast cultures were the Moche, the Huari, the Chimu,\nand the Nazca. Many of these cultures had their political and cultural centers in large urban areas\nlike Tiwanaku, which had a population of about 40,000 people around 100 CE. More than 1,000\nyears later, it was the Inca Empire that would build on these cultural traditions, extending its rule\nover more than 5,000 kilometers from Ecuador to Chile.\nSedentary culture first began in North America when people in the desert southwest of the\ncontinent began to cultivate maize about three thousand years ago. Groups like the Chaco Anasazi\nin New Mexico would eventually construct massive complexes of aqueducts, homes, and ceremo-\nnial spaces by about 1000 CE. There were other major cultural areas all over North America, from\nFlorida to the frigid Arctic.\nDespite (or perhaps because of) their late arrival in the Americas, humans developed at an in-\ncredible pace all across the region. The residents of the Americas developed remarkable political\nsophistication, infrastructure, religion, art, economic integration, and technology that Europeans\nmarveled at when they arrived in the late fifteenth century.\n10.11 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nAdams, Richard E.W.

They were\nin aggressive pursuit of the leader\nof the neighboring Naiman tribe, a\ncertain K\u00fcchl\u00fcg, who had the mis-\nfortune of allying with Jamukha,\nthe principle rival of Genghis Khan.\nThe khan had quickly dispatched\nwith their combined armies,\nforcing K\u00fcchl\u00fcg to seek refuge\namong the Qara Khitai, located to\nthe southwest. In the intervening\nMap 11.1 | Map of the Mongol Empire c. 1207 CE\nyears, K\u00fcchl\u00fcg somehow managed Author: User \u201cKhiruge\u201d\nto usurp the Qara Khitai throne. Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nNot long thereafter, he attacked a\nPage | 398 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nKarluk tribal confederacy that appealed to Genghis Khan for protection. The Mongol leader deployed\n30,000 troops to track down this troublesome renegade. By 1218 the inveterate adventurer had fled\nsouth towards the Pamir Mountains in modern day Afghanistan. Eventually, the Mongol general\nJebe, along with the help of some local hunters, caught up with K\u00fcchl\u00fcg and executed him. And\nyet it was the pursuit of the fugitive K\u00fcchl\u00fcg that inadvertently brought the Mongols into Central\nAsia. Their conquest of the region was one without the forethought of empire, yet the area absorbed,\nadopted, and integrated the Mongols, just as it had incorporated external forces many times before.\nCentral Asia displayed a remarkable ability to embrace foreign influences, such as the Turkic\nmigrations, expansion of Islam, and Mongol conquest, internalizing them and making them its\nown, much like an interesting stew. Situated at the crossroads of many empires, Central Asia was\ntucked in between the Chinese, Europeans, Arabs, and Indians. There, in the middle of these grand\ncivilizations, just along the Great Silk Road, the region connected the Orient to the Occident and\nlinked it to major patterns in world history. It was from there that these external forces saturated\nthe area and shaped the course of its history.\nMap 11.2 | Map of the Silk Road\nAuthor: User \u201cCaptain Blood\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n11.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

There are several broad\ngeographical zones in Central Asia none-\ntheless. Perhaps the most well-known\ntopographic area in Central Asia is the\ngreat Eurasian Steppe, a latitudinal belt\nof grassland that stretches from Eastern\nEurope through Mongolia. It was there\nthat nomadic horse cultures flourished.\nLocated to the south of the steppe was\nthe core of Central Asia, an area known\nas Transoxiana. This is a dry region\nMap 11.3 | Map of Central Asia\nthat lies beyond the Oxus River, known Author: User \u201cLyriak\u201d\ntoday as the Amu Darya. In Transoxiana Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 401 trade settlements and irrigated agricul-\nture developed along the Amu Darya and\nSyr Darya watersheds. Finally, located to\nthe far south, lies the mountainous area\nof Khorasan, the cultural capital of Persia\nprior to the appearance of the Mongols.\n11.6 TURKIC MIGRATIONS\nNomadic migration was the first major\nexternal influence that would be integrat-\ned into the culture of the region, as steppe\npeoples imparted a lasting impression to\nCentral Asia. Beginning with the Xiongnu Map 11.4 | Map of the Xiongnu Empire in 205 BCE\n(209 BCE \u2013 93 CE), a long-term exodus of Author: User \u201cPostmann Michael\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nsteppe peoples spread out of Mongolia and\nLicense: Public Domain\ninto Central Asia. For millennia prior to the\nrise of Genghis Khan, the winners of the\ntribal battles for predominance on the Orkhon Steppe, prime pastureland located in western\nMongolia, forced the vanquished off to the west. These periodic mass departures of Turkic tribes\nout of the area progressed\nsouthwest into Central Asia\nin a migration conquest,\nnot a trade diaspora, as\nhappened to Africans during\nthe slave trade. These new\narrivals forever altered the\nethnic makeup of Central\nAsia. Previously, the region\nhad been predominantly\nPersian and Indo-European;\nwhen the waves of Turkic\ntribes penetrated into the\narea, though, they occupied\nthe great steppe and agricul-\ntural basin of Central Asia\nand pushed these Persian\ngroups to the fringes. Over\nMap 11.5 | Map of the Great Eurasian Steppe time, they slowly Turkified\nAuthor: User \u201cShattered Gnome\u201d the area, endowing it with a\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nmore nomadic character.\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 402 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nThese Turkic tribesmen divided their society into five strata. Members of the royal tribal clan\npresided over the social order. This dominant group bestowed its name on the tribal confederation,\na collection of tribes. Positioned below them were their allies and associated tribes. Next were the\ncommon herders who did not participate in struggles for power. Lower still were the artisans, such\nas blacksmiths and leatherworkers. And finally, we find slaves at the bottom of the hierarchy. They\nusually acquired their lowly position in society by means of capture in times of war.\nThese Turkic wanderers belonged to an unstable confederation of clans and tribes roaming\nthe steppe, loosely bound under a khagan, a charismatic monarch who laid claim to some sort\nof divine providence. Khagan made use of their personal charisma, as well as their political and\nmilitary smarts, in order to maintain group cohesion and ward off challenges to their authority.\nUnder strong khagans, tribal confederations were capable of wielding incredible power, but, more\noften than not, they were notoriously volatile and often imploded upon the death of their leader,\ncollapsing into a brutal struggle for power. The winners in this struggle forced the losers out of the\narea, and while many went to the north or south, most to the west. Victorious tribes remained in\nMongolia on the highly-prized Orkhon Steppe, located near Lake Baikal.\nAlthough the khaganate was a diarchy, or system of dual rule, with the oldest son controlling\nhalf of the land, it lacked a clear transition of power, like hereditary succession. Because the khagan\ntheoretically ruled over a series of tribal confederations, any member of the tribal confederation\ncould ascend to the position of monarch by demonstrating their personal charisma and martial\nskills on the battlefield. This often resulted in a fight to prove oneself that could erupt into broader\ninter-tribal strife.\nPeriodic Turkic migrations into Central Asia transformed the sedentary culture of the region.\nThese steppe peoples lived by practicing pastoral nomadism, a way of life centered around\nherding that most likely predated the\nTurks but was eventually adopted by\nthem. Their culture was utilitarian in\nnature and provided all the necessities\nfor life on the great plains of Central\nAsia, including food, clothing, shelter,\nand transportation. In order to maintain\ntheir pastures, these horsemen followed\na fixed, seasonal pattern of migration\nbecause they did not want their flocks\nto overgraze. During the winter, for\ninstance, they camped in foothills and\nmountain valleys, where it was warmer\nat lower altitudes. There they built fixed\nshelters with one main objective: survival. Figure 11.1 | A Naadam Boy Riding a Mongol Horse on\nThe oral tradition, which included songs, the Mongolian Steppe\nAuthor: User \u201cinvictsHOG\u201d\nepic narratives, and parables, flourished\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nduring the inhospitable winter months. License: Public Domain\nPage | 403 In the spring, the nomads made a ten-day trip to the prairieland to graze their herds on fresh\ngrass that just emerged from mountain runoff. There the women and children erected a central\ncamp, usually comprising four yurts, while the men divided the flocks into their specific pastures.\nThey established about ten satellite camps around the central camp, with each herd positioned\nabout ten to twenty miles from the center. This separation of camps minimized the potential\nthreat that their enemies posed to their herds. During the summer, they traveled to mid-mountain\nfields, where it was cooler and offered access to water. Covering about ten miles per day, it took\nthem approximately fifty days to reach this campground. Finally, in the fall, they returned to the\nsteppe in order to make provisions for the harsh winter. These preparations included drying and\npreserving their meat, and taking milk from their animals.\nEnhanced mobility was the key to the survival of pastoral nomads. They actually spent a good\nportion of their lives on horseback and were accustomed to moving over long distances, taking all of\nlife\u2019s necessities with them. This allowed them to retreat quickly from rival attacks or areas afflicted\nby natural disaster. Though their way of life appeared seemingly innocuous, it enhanced the ability\nof these horsemen to expand rapidly and conquer neighboring groups. It was in this manner that\npastoral nomadism accorded its practitioners certain martial advantages. The annual Great Hunt\nserved as a military proving ground that helped them hone their fighting skills. In preparation for\nwinter, tribes deployed groups of mounted\nmen, who dispersed in different directions,\nwith the intent of driving every animal within\na set perimeter inwards to converge at a\npre-established central point. With great co-\nordination taking place over vast distances,\nthese migrants learned how to coordinate\ntheir movements based on a color scheme of\narrows and whistling patterns. Their herding\ntactics easily translated to military tactics and\nproved devastating in combat.\nNomad society was certainly capable\nof waging war. Their ability to shoot from\nhorseback provided them with a mobile and\nlethal means to overcome slower, infantry-\nbased armies. These horsemen carried\nportable, three-foot-long recurve bows\ncapable of piercing enemy armor from over\n450 meters. Metal thumb rings enabled a\nrapid rate of fire without damaging the archer\u2019s\nfingers. Raised hunting and herding from\nFigure 11.2 | Archers on the Mongol Horse horseback, nomads even learned how to sleep\nAuthor: Sayf al-V\u00e2hid\u00ee\nin the saddle of the Mongol Horse, their\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain indigenous horse. Though not tall in stature,\nPage | 404 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nthese sturdy mounts displayed impressive endurance and allowed groups to traverse great distances,\noften up to 160 kilometers per day. The speed with which they could cover territory on their steeds\noften confused sedentary forces and multiplied the terror factor. Native to the region, these horses\nwere able to forage for themselves and survive on their own. Nomads did not require supply lines\nand could, therefore, remain on campaign for an average of three years. The combination of the skills\nacquired from herding, the double-compound bow, and the Mongol Horse, translated to a formula\nfor political domination of Central Asia, at least until the arrival of Genghis Khan and the Mongols.\nTurkic domination of the region began on the battlefield, where the strategies of steppe warfare\nproved devastating to infantry-based armies. The first stage of the nomad battle strategy\noften commenced with a feigned retreat, in which a group of their cavalry engaged the adversary,\nretreated, and encouraged their opponents to follow them. This technique lengthened the lines\nof their challengers, as they pursued the \u201cretreating\u201d Turkic cavalrymen, who were busy shooting\nbackwards from horseback. The next stage of battle involved outflanking the enemy and envel-\noping them. They then showered their foes with arrows, the objective being to pin the opponent\nin place. This alone was often enough to break a sedentary power. When fighting against another\nsteppe power, their reserves charged the opponent\u2019s lines so as to break their forces into pieces\nand finish them off piecemeal. Most importantly, because of their limited numbers, the Turkic\nhorsemen were reluctant to risk fighting an enemy that they did not believe they could defeat,\ninstead, they would poison water wells, scorch the earth, and retreat. The Mongols would later\nemploy similar battle tactics that allowed them to conquer the whole of Central Asia.\n11.7 ISLAM\nIslam was not the first foreign religion to arrive in Central Asia. In fact, the region had already\nbeen exposed to many foreign systems of belief prior to the coming of Islam in the seventh\ncentury. Local merchants conducting long-distance trade along the Silk Road came into contact\nwith many different religious doctrines; the trade route served as a conveyor of not only goods but\nalso concepts. Generally, intellectual diffusion is not a one-way street, as western ideas traveled\neastward and eastern concepts filtered into the west. In this manner, the Silk Road carried\nBuddhism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism (an Iranian religion with both monotheistic and dualist\nelements), Siberian Shamanism, and even Nestorian Christianity to Central Asia. The great\nnumber of religions found in the area at the introduction of Islam testified to the great tolerance\nof the region. By the tenth century, however, all of the non-monotheistic faiths had disappeared\nfrom Central Asia in the aftermath of Islamic conquest.\nIt was Qutayba ibn Muslim (669 \u2013 716) who expanded the presence of Islam in Central\nAsia during the eighth century, as the general\u2019s forces swept into the area, defeated the Persians,\nand by 715 CE completed their conquest of Transoxiana, the region located beyond the Oxus\nRiver. A decisive Arab Muslim victory over the Chinese at the Battle of Talas River in 751\nsecured Central Asia and repulsed the only major challenge to Islamic rule. The triumph over the\nChinese made it possible for Islam to become entrenched in the region. The Persian Samanids\n(819 \u2013 999) made Islam the official state religion and established a school of theology in Bukhara.\nPage | 405 But Islamization did not take place overnight; instead, it took centuries. Transoxiana slowly\nIslamicized, though it never Arabized. The peoples in the area remained culturally Turkic and\nPersian. Central Asia retained its Turkic and Persian languages, albeit with a heavy Arabic\ninfluence in religious vocabulary.\nIt took generations for Islam to become fully ingrained in the culture of Central Asia. Unlike\nother places, where the religion filtered into society from the bottom up, as was the case in\nSoutheast Asia, Islamization in the region occurred from the top down. The process incorporated\nnative peoples, who took part in the process of conversion. Local leaders submitted to the faith\nin order to maintain their social status and elite position in society. The conquerors offered the\nCentral Asian nobility important positions in the administration so long as they professed Islam,\nproviding the opportunity for the native elite to rule in their own right.\nIslam also displayed a remarkable ability to assimilate indigenous Central Asian frontier\ncustoms as it advanced through the area, allowing some traditional practices to remain so long as\nit accelerated conversion. By accepting certain harmless practices in order to Islamicize Central\nAsia, these Muslims mirrored Christian efforts to Christianize Eastern Europe.\n11.7.1 Sufism\nThe Islam of Central Asia differed greatly from that which originated in the Arabian Peninsula.\nThis vast region embraced Islam, remaking it into a syncretic faith that was culturally its own.\nEssentially a sort of mysticism, or folk Islam, Sufism in the area emerged from the fusion of Islamic\nsedentary civilization and Buddhist nomadic culture. Central Asians were generally receptive and\ntolerant of foreign beliefs, but in order for the faith to take root in the area, missionaries had to\nmake some concessions to the native, specifically pastoral-nomadic culture. The urban-dwell-\ning and agricultural populations of the region generally accepted Sunni Islam and the law of the\nSharia; however, the culture and lifestyle of the itinerant peoples of the steppe did not readily\nconform to the rigors of Islamic law. Sufism helped convert these tribes to Islam, in part due to its\ndoctrinal flexibility. What arose from the mix of orthodox Islam and Turkic pastoral nomadism\nwas a uniquely Central Asian brand of Sufism.\nIn this context, Sufis evangelized to groups on the frontier of Central Asia. Actually, Sufi\nmerchants were largely responsible for bringing Islam to the region. Central Asian Sufi orders such\nas the Yasaviyah established themselves along trade routes in order to reach out to travelers.\nThese missionaries also proselytized to the Turkic communities on the steppe. Meanwhile, the\nNaqshbandi Order, operating in travel lodges, spread Sufism by ministering to Iranian and\nTajik peoples. The followers of these Sufi orders believed that they could better disseminate a\nform of the faith that was more loving and caring.\n11.8 THE MONGOL ERA\nThe Mongols greatly expanded into Central Asia during the thirteenth century. There they\nreunited with the Turkic groups who had been expelled from the Orkhon Steppe over the course\nPage | 406 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nof a millennia. The Mongols confronted many Turkic peoples who had radically altered their\nexistence since their days on the plains and adopted a stationary way of life.\nAt this point in time, forces indigenous to the region shaped the world around it; foreign\ninfluence waned as a consequence of nativism. The Mongols created the largest empire in history,\nas Central Asia externalized the violence of the steppe, yet it was with enormous difficulty that\nthey even united as a people. Perhaps the greatest obstacle for them to overcome was their own\ndivisiveness. Inter-tribal strife was commonplace, but once they united, the Mongols expanded\ndeep into Russia, China, India, and the Middle East.\n11.8.1 A New System for Unity\nIt was Temujin (1206 \u2013 1227), later known as Genghis Khan, who brought this fractured\npeople together and developed a method of governance and expansion that lasted long after his\ndeath. Born into the aristocratic Borjigin Clan, most likely in 1167, Temujin\u2019s success related\nto his convictions. Inspired by oral tales of past glory, his personal charisma and sense of fate\nenabled him to survive a youth of life-threatening privation, eventually bringing the various\nMongol tribes together.\nWith a keen awareness of his own destiny, Temujin was inspired to achieve greatness. He had\na clear vision that God predestined him to function\nas His temporal ruler on Earth and exhibited a\ndesire to claim universal lordship. Through a series\nof fights, he eventually subjugated local clans in\neastern Mongolia. He then expanded his political\ncontrol of the region through a marriage alliance to\nB\u00f6rte \u00dcjin, a member of the Olkhonut Tribe, which\nmaintained friendly relations with Temujin\u2019s Khiyad\nTribe. The Merkit Tribe kidnapped his wife not long\nthereafter. Temujin heroically rescued her from this\nrival tribe, but she had been held in captivity for eight\nmonths and soon gave birth to their first son Juchi,\nwho suffered from an uncertain parentage. Some\nhistorians believe that Temujin acquired the notion\nof conquering all of the Mongols from his liberation\nof B\u00f6rte.\nDespite his early successes, Temujin remained\ngreatly outnumbered by his opponents and was\nforced to retreat to the Heights of Baljuna, located\nin modern day Manchuria, where he convinced his\nfollowers to swear an oath of total allegiance to him\nFigure 11.3 | Temujin (Genghis Khan)\nAuthor: Anonymous who called for them to fight unto death for him. For\nSource: Wikimedia Commons their unwavering loyalty, he promised his supporters\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 407 a share in his glory upon their victory. Some Mongol tribes yielded to Temujin by 1204 and agreed\nto recognize him as their leader, thus paving the way for a period of final unification of the Mongols.\nTemujin demanded a high level of commitment from his people, endowing his forces with\na coherency and unity of purpose. He also promoted allies based on merit, rather than by the\ntraditional Mongol method of advancement based on position within the tribal hierarchy. His\nopponents, on the other hand, lacked his force of will and entered into a series of squabbles.\nTemujin took advantage of their internal fights, emerging victorious by 1206. The culmination\nof his ascendency took place that year at a Mongol assembly, or khuriltai, which appointed him\nas the first undisputed ruler of the Mongols, uniting them under the authority of his position.\nTemujin adopted the name of Genghis Khan, or universal ruler in this context.\nGenghis Khan presided over peoples who had experienced near-constant warfare since 1160.\nPreviously, tribal confederations were loose alliances held together under charismatic khagans\nand punctuated by tribal warfare. He consolidated all of these diverse tribes and reshaped them\ninto a single \u201cnation,\u201d endowing Mongol society with more cohesiveness, a key element to future\nexpansion. He did this by developing a new political order that deviated from tradition.\nRestructuring Mongol society into new administrative military units that provided the\nnecessary impetus for expansion, Genghis Khan charged each of his commanders with a tribal\nunit that was responsible for controlling a particular pasture and fielding soldiers when needed.\nHis system had the added effect of assuaging previous conflicts by assigning the members of one\ntribe to military detail with other rival tribes, thus emphasizing collective responsibility. By forcing\nthe men from one tribe to stand guard over the pastures of other tribes, he weakened loyalty to\nancestral lines and homelands, thereby reinforcing his own leadership.\nGenghis Khan represented the ultimate source of justice in his newly-formed state, consol-\nidating his position and making it more authoritarian. By embodying autocracy in the position\nof the khan, he made the title of khan institutional, not personal, building a new foundation for\nlegitimacy. Previously, tribal leadership rested on charisma. Furthermore, the great khan could\nnot be self-proclaimed but had to be recognized at a khuriltai.\nHis law, known as Yassa, originated as decrees delivered during war. Yassa remained secret,\nwhich allowed Genghis Khan to adapt it to changing circumstances. For example, he later incorpo-\nrated cultural elements indigenous to Mongol society into the law. He based his code on shamanist\nprinciples, and it served as the social and political formula binding all Mongols together. It also\nstrengthened Mongol, rather than clan or tribal identification. It is believed that Genghis Khan\nhimself directed the law, while his stepbrother Shihihutag served as the high judge, and his son\nChagatai administered its execution.\n11.8.2 Expansion\nGenghis Khan encouraged Mongol expansion and the conquest of Central Asia. After\nsubduing inter-tribal warfare, he followed tradition and exported the violence of the steppe. He\noffered incentives to his soldiers; the spoils of victory went to those who followed him into battle.\nGenghis Khan received ten percent of the loot and divided the remaining ninety percent between\nPage | 408 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nhis commanders, who, in turn, distributed their portion amongst their retinue. This plunder also\nincluded the inhabitants of all subjugated lands, which resulted in the dramatic depopulation of\nconquered territory, as the khan received his share of artisans and craftsmen to be sent back to\nthe itinerant Mongol capital.\nIn 1208, Genghis Khan targeted northern China for pillaging, but he quickly encountered con-\nsiderable difficulties overcoming well-fortified Chinese municipalities. The Chinese had ringed\ntheir principle metropolises with moats and connected these major urban centers to several\nsmaller satellite towns via underground tunnels. The Mongols had attempted to starve these cities\ninto submission, but they lacked the military technology necessary to overcome walls forty-feet\nhigh and fifty-feet wide. To counter these challenges, they imported the technology necessary to\ndefeat Chinese cities. Genghis Khan also compensated for a lack of native talent by incorporating\nforeign engineers into their army. He utilized Arab, Persian, and Chinese experts to solve the\nproblem of defeating Chinese municipalities. Their knowledge of siege warfare enabled them to\nconstruct the siege engines capable of subjugating cities.\nAdding these new sedentary peoples to the khan\u2019s army inevitably caused problems, for\nthese men hailed from distinctly different cultures and did not interact well with the Mongols.\nMap 11.6 | Map of Mongol Conquests Under Genghis Khan\nAuthor: User \u201cBkkbrad\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 409 Genghis Khan, therefore, combined the mobility of his forces with the slow, bulky siege engines\nof the sedentary armies. While he kept his cavalry independent from the foreign engineers,\nmostly comprised of mercenaries, he blended these two disparate groups on the battlefield to\nhis strategic advantage.\nFor the Mongols, building an empire proved much easier than maintaining one. The nomads\npossessed an inherent need to loot and plunder cities, and Genghis Khan took advantage of this\ninnate desire by remaining on campaign. But the Mongols had difficulty understanding settled\ncivilization and did not know how to maintain order in that new and different cultural milieu.\nAlthough they were able to instill fear in their enemies and easily forced many cities to capitu-\nlate, the Mongols co-opted local officials to ensure that taxes and tribute flowed freely back to\ntheir capital.\nWith his newly-constructed army, Genghis Khan returned to northern China again in 1210\nand began a continuous campaign of destruction, primarily directed against the Jin Dynasty\n(1115 \u2013 1234), an empire ruled by a Jurchen minority, a Tungusic people from Manchuria who\nwould later call themselves the Manchu. In an early battle, the Jin put their Turkic cavalry up\nfront to confront the Mongol horsemen. The Mongols managed to convince the Jin Dynasty\u2019s\ncavalry to defect to their side. Genghis Khan subsequently advanced on the Jin capital of Zhongdu\nand entered into a prolonged siege. In November of 1211, the khan withdrew his troops to their\nwinter pastures, only to return again in 1212. Genghis Khan attempted a rash assault of the city.\nHe failed and was wounded in the process. His Mongols had to retreat once again.\nGenghis Khan returned a fourth time in March of 1213, this time with the goal of conquer-\ning Korea, Manchuria, and all of northern China. Early difficulties campaigning against the Jin\nDynasty prompted him to adjust his strategy. By laying waste to all of northern China, he aimed\nto annihilate their way of life, turning the region into vast pastureland for his herds. The Mongol\nleader surrounded Zhongdu and starved the city\u2019s inhabitants into submission. He systemati-\ncally obliterated everything in order to send a message to the inhabitants that it was futile to\nresist him. He even considered taking the city, brick by brick, and dumping it into the Yellow\nRiver. Fortunately for the residents of Zhongdu, a captured Chinese bureaucrat intervened and\nconvinced Genghis Khan that it would be better to \u201csack\u201d them every year through the collection\nof tribute. Mongol interest in rebuilding the city began soon thereafter, as Genghis Khan incorpo-\nrated northern China into his state and opened the region to trade. This campaign represented the\nfirst significant addition of territory to the Mongol Empire.\nAs this chapter began, it was with the tenacious pursuit of the fugitive K\u00fcchl\u00fcg in 1216 that\noriginally brought the Mongols into Central Asia. There they aroused the disdain of the local ruler\nin the area, Khwarazmshah Ala al-Din Muhammad II. Ruling over a loose confederation of\ndisparate peoples, Ala al-Din Muhammad lacked security in his position as the Khwarazmshah.\nEven his own mother was in intrigue against him. It was he who provoked the wrath of the\nMongols. It all began when Genghis Khan sent a trade caravan, which probably included some\nspies dressed incognito as merchants, to the frontier post of Otrar, located along the Syr Darya. The\nshah believed that the trade mission was a mere deception meant to obscure an eminent invasion.\nInalchuq, uncle of Ala al-Din Muhammad and governor of Otrar, improvidently convinced the\nPage | 410 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nMap 11.7 | Map of the Khwarezmian Empire, 1190-1220 CE\nAuthor: Arab League\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nKhwarazmshah to have the entire party executed. An enraged Genghis Khan quickly dispatched\nanother envoy and demanded that the governor of the city be put to death and have his head\nsent back to Mongolia as proof that Genghis Khan\u2019s wishes were fulfilled. The shah executed\nthis emissary too, a rash decision that precipitated the Mongol onslaught of Central Asia, which\nresulted in brutal massacres and a drastic depopulation of the region.\nAla al-Din Muhammad prudently fled the area, leaving the citizens of Khwarazmia to defend\nthemselves against the forces of Genghis Khan. A total of five Mongol armies approached the\nKhwarazm capital of Samarkand from different directions, converging in 1220. The Mongols\nslayed the inhabitants of the city and constructed pyramid-like edifices out of their severed skulls.\nIn 1221, they seized the city of Urgench and dumped it into the Amu Darya, piece by piece, diverting\nthe course of the waterway. And yet, Khwarazmshah Ala al-Din Muhammad still inexplicably\nescaped capture and absconded south. Genghis Khan deployed another force of some 30,000\ntroops under the generals Jebe and S\u00fcbedei to track him down and put him to death. The shah\neventually sought refuge on an island in Caspian, where he died of pleurisy.\nPage | 411 Meanwhile, Jalal al-Din Manguburti, the\nson of the Khwarazmshah, assembled an army\nof resistance. Genghis Khan sent his stepbrother\nShihihutug to apprehend Jalal, but he escaped\nto the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan.\nJalal\u2019s forces managed to defeat the Shihihutug-\nled Mongols on the field of battle at Parwan\nin the spring of 1221, a rare loss. The Mongols\nactually respected Jalal for his display of valor\nand willingness to resist them. Jalal fled to Figure 11.4 | Death of Khwarazmshah Ala al-Din\nIndia via the Khyber Pass with his pride intact. Muhammad II | From Jami\u2019 al-tawarikh by Rashid\nal-Din Hamadani\nThe khan headed south himself and defeated\nAuthor: Sayf al-V\u00e2hid\u00ee\nJalal al-Din along the banks of the Indus River. Source: Wikimedia Commons\nFollowing their defeat of Jalal, the Mongols License: Public Domain\ndescended into India but quickly found the hot\nand humid climate inhospitable; they decided to\nreturn to Mongolia, arriving home by 1225. The\nCentral Asia campaign had started as a punitive\nexpedition but in the process had wiped out any\ntype of resistance in the region.\nIn the interim, Genghis Khan had ordered\nJebe and S\u00fcbedei to explore and reconnoiter the\nwest. Between 1221 and 1223 the two most gifted\nof the khan\u2019s generals traveled towards Russia.\nIn the course of their journey, they defeated\nthe Georgians, Armenians, princes of Rus,\nand Kipchak Turkic tribes. Then they abruptly\nreturned home. The purpose was not to annex\nthe territory but to gather intelligence, which\nproved to be important to their campaign against\nthe princes of Rus between 1236 and 1240.\nMeanwhile, Genghis Khan had died on expedi-\ntion in southern China in 1227. Upon his death,\nthe Mongols participated in a year of mourning,\nhalting expansion.\n11.8.3 Succession\nFigure 11.5 | Jalal al-Din Fords the Indus River\nThe Mongols were the only steppe tribes\nWhile in Flight from the Mongols\nwhose empire actually expanded upon the Author: Banwar\u00ed Kh\u00fard and Dharm D\u00e1s\ndeath of its founder. In fact, most of the Mongol Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 412 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nconquests actually transpired after\nthe passing of Genghis Khan. Unlike\nprevious tribal confederations, it did\nnot implode because Genghis Khan\nhad invented a safe and reliable means\nof transferring power. He also stabi-\nlized Mongol society and made it less\nfractious, constructing a framework\nfor subsequent generations to follow.\nTo maintain political legitimacy and\ninherit the throne under this new\nMap 11.8 | Map of the Empires of the Four Patrimonial Ulus\nsystem, one had to trace their ancestry\nAuthor: User \u201cGabagool\u201d\nback to Genghis Khan through his Source: Wikimedia Commons\nwife B\u00f6rte and her four sons, Juchi, License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nChagatai, \u00d6gedei, and Tolui. This\nconcept dramatically limited contenders for the khanate, mitigating future competition for suc-\ncession. Only they possessed the required Genghis-Khanid legitimacy.\nThe khan\u2019s plan to transfer power upon his death also fused older steppe traditions with his\nnew vision. He bequeathed to his sons parts of the world yet unconquered, so that they had to\nwin these new areas. This stipulation produced an incentive for his sons to cooperate in order to\ncollect their patrimony. Genghis Khan had divided the four patrimonial ulus, or states, amongst\nhis sons. The four subsequent empires that grew out of these ulus included the Golden Horde,\nwho were the descendants of Juchi and controlled Russia; the Chagatai Khanate, which traced\nits lineage to Chagatai and governed Central Asia; the Mongol-founded Yuan Dynasty in China,\nthe progeny of Tolui; and the Ilkhanate of Persia, inheritors of the House of H\u00fcleg\u00fc and also the\nsuccessors of Tolui.\nPrior to his death in 1227, Genghis\nKhan expressed a desire that his son\n\u00d6gedei succeed him, a decision that\naffronted Juchi, his eldest, whose\nlineage was questioned. Fortunately for\nthe Mongols, Juchi\u2019s death preceded\nthat of his father\u2019s, narrowly averting a\npotential civil war. A khuriltai in 1229\nconfirmed the khan\u2019s wishes, and it was\nunder \u00d6gedei that the Mongols realized\ntheir destiny of world domination.\nBetween 1230 and 1233, \u00d6gedei\u2019s troops\nMap 11.9 | Map of the Khanate of the Golden Horde, 1300 CE defeated the remnants of the Jin dynasty\nAuthor: User \u201cGabagool\u201d\nin central China. Then they focused\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 their attention on Russia, as they had\nPage | 413 actionable intelligence on the divisions among the Russian\nprincipalities dating to a 1223 reconnaissance mission\nthat utterly crushed a coalition of Russian and Kipchak\nprinces. In 1236, \u00d6gedei launched his campaign in the\ndead of winter and used rivers as frozen ice highways. By\nend of 1237, they had taken the Black Steppe, Vladimir,\nand Riazan. It was only some fortuitous flooding that\nprevented the complete destruction of Novgorod. The\nPrince of Novgorod was, however, sufficiently impressed\nby the Mongol onslaught so voluntarily agreed to pay their\ntribute. The Mongols commenced a devastating attack\non the city of Kiev in December of 1240, culminating in\na nine-day siege. They ultimately destroyed the city as\nretribution for its resistance. The Mongols steamrolled the\nHungarians soon thereafter and left the region in ruins en\nroute to Vienna. By December of 1241, their forces were\napproaching the outskirts of the city. No military power in\nEurope was capable of withstanding a Mongol attack.\nFortunately for the Viennese, \u00d6gedei died that very\nFigure 11.6 | G\u00fcy\u00fck at the Partyc | From\nTarikh-i Jahangushay-i by Juvaini same month, and a one year period of mourning ensued.\nAuthor: User \u201cBahatur\u201d The Mongols were summoned home in order to choose\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthe next great khan. What was supposed to be a quick\nLicense: Public Domain\nelection turned into a five-year ordeal because Batu, son\nof Juchi and grandson of Genghis Khan, refused to return\nto Mongolia for the khuriltai. This founder of the Golden\nHorde believed that he would not be chosen and knew that\nhis relatives could not officially convene a khuriltai without\nhim, thus preventing the body from proclaiming the next\ngreat khan. It was \u00d6gedei\u2019s death and Batu\u2019s independence\nof thought that saved Europe from Mongol conquest.\nThe khuriltai finally proclaimed G\u00fcy\u00fck, eldest son of\n\u00d6gedei, the next khan in 1246. This was not a legitimate\nelection though because of Batu\u2019s conspicuous absence.\nG\u00fcy\u00fck quickly dispatched an army to punish Batu for\nmeddling in the political process of succession, but Batu\nhad already arranged for his cousin\u2019s assassination in\n1248. G\u00fcy\u00fck\u2019s death led to another period of paralysis. A\nFigure 11.7 | Audience with M\u00f6ngke | khuriltai eventually nominated M\u00f6ngke, Tolui\u2019s oldest\nFrom Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i by Juvaini son, as the next great khan in 1251.

He was\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain willing to allow for Batu\u2019s autonomy so long as he recog-\nPage | 414 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nnized M\u00f6ngke as the legitimate khan. It was at this point that Batu\u2019s horde become the Golden\nHorde. He adopted the moniker of \u201cgolden\u201d because he was asserting his independence.\nBatu died in 1256, and his younger brother Berke became the first khan of the Golden Horde\nto accept Islam. This sudden conversion to Islam caused systemic problems in the Mongol Empire\nbecause different parts of the four lines of Genghis Khan would adopt different faiths, resulting in\npolitical divisions that aligned with religious divisions. As a Muslim, Berke spurned his Buddhist\ncousins and established firm links with the Turkic Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, thus making an\nalliance based on faith with a power outside of the Mongol Empire.\nGenghis Khan\u2019s empire had exceeded normal steppe expectations, and, with potential fault\nlines emerging already, his vision of a politically unified empire was never truly realized. A\nseries of civil wars erupted not long thereafter that fractured the Mongol Empire. First came the\nToluid Civil War (1260 \u2013 1264), then the Berke-H\u00fcleg\u00fc War (1262), and finally the Kaidu-Kublai\nWar (1268 \u2013 1301). These three wars had the combined effect of undermining the great khan\u2019s\nauthority, and the empire ended up breaking apart on along the lines of the patrimonial ulus,\nwith each moving in their own direction. In fact, the successors of Kublai Khan (1260 \u2013 1294),\nwho presided over the Yuan Dynasty in China, could not even convene a khuriltai to appoint a\ngreat khan following his death. By 1294, there was neither fiction nor fa\u00e7ade of a unified Mongol\nEmpire. It was the end of a unified political unit.\n11.9 THE KHANATE OF CHAGATAI\nChagatai (1226 \u2013 1241), the second son of Genghis and his wife B\u00f6rte, had participated in\nhis father\u2019s campaigns, and in 1227 he claimed his patrimonial territory designated as between\nthe Caspian Sea and the Tarim Basin. The origins of the Chagatai Khanate shaped its political\nand demographic character; Chagatai obtained the core of Central Asia, a personal pasture-\nland located along the Kazakh\nsteppe. He also received the\nsettled lands to the south\nin modern day Uzbekistan.\nChagatai never demonstrated\nambition for the position of\ngreat khan; rather, he played\nan important role helping\nhis brother \u00d6gedei exercise\nauthority and uphold Yassa.\nIn doing so, Chagatai served as\nthe glue that helped hold the\nMongol Empire together.\nAs was the case with his Map 11.10 | Map of the Khanate of Chagatai, 1300 CE\nfather, Genghis Khan, Chagatai Author: User \u201cGabagool\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nhad trouble coping with the\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 415 cultural differences that existed between steppe and settled societies. His solution to the conflict\nbetween these two civilizations was known as Inju, a dual-administrative system and a form of\nindirect rule. Inju was a political concession designed to separate the two incompatible cultures,\nallowing both to maintain their own traditional laws yet remain subject to the authority of\nChagatai and his descendants. Chagatai was conscious not to force Yassa on sedentary Muslim\ncities; however, it continued to be exercised on the plains. In agricultural and urban areas, a\nbureaucratic tradition with a Muslim administration persisted. So long as these Muslims did not\nopenly resist Mongol control, they could go about their daily business, free from Mongol interfer-\nence in their life. It was in this way that the steppe continued to abide by customary Mongol law,\nwhile in the south the people of the cities lived according to the Sharia, or Quranic law.\nInju was also an economic arrangement granting the Mongols a share of the resources produced\nin sedentary lands. The Mongols rewarded those who cooperated in governance with a portion of\nthe profits; those who participated in Inju were entitled to their allotment of the common imperial\nsettled possessions. At first, all of the conquered towns remained the property of the khan, but\nover time access to the wealth of the urban areas extended to the nomads who took part in Inju.\nAlthough Inju was a practical solution to the difficulty of governing the two separate societies,\nit ultimately did not resolve the problem of uniting the sedentary Turkic population and the\nnomadic Mongols since it failed to accommodate the needs of either society. Actually, it encour-\naged friction between the two civilizations because it placed hardships on both peoples. While the\nhorsemen benefited handsomely from Inju, they considered it incompatible with their traditional\npractices because it forced them to climb down from their steeds and settle down in the cities.\nYes, the Mongols did receive tribute, slaves, and status as compensation for the inconvenience\nof ruling over settled lands, but the costs of sustaining this empire were heavy. It was just too\ndemanding for them to uphold. First, the maintenance of empire disrupted the nomadic way of\nlife because they often had to join in exhaustive campaigns, lasting years at a time. Second, the\nnomads were unaccustomed to a considerable amount of government interference in their daily\nroutine. Increasingly, they viewed the prospect of governing an empire as a burden and preferred\nto revert to a pastoral lifestyle on the prairie. They sought more independence and stability, so\nthey consciously began to defect from the system and return to their pastures.\nThose living in the settled lands to the south chaffed under Inju as well. Though they rec-\nognized that government remained an essential part of life, Inju encumbered urban-dwelling\nand farming peoples too. The Mongols stressed this population by raising additional taxes in\nan unpredictable and disruptive manner. This annoyed the city folk, who were accustomed to\nmore regular taxation. Ultimately, Inju did not mesh well with either lifestyle. The practice rested\non force, not utility. The Mongol state sustained two different societies that often remained in\nconflict, so it stayed in a state of permanent instability.\n11.9.1 Turko-Mongol Fusion\nThe Mongols were the first to unify the Eurasian steppe, and their occupation of the region corre-\nsponded to a wholesale takeover. As they migrated southwest down the steppe, they failed to displace\nPage | 416 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nthe Turkic peoples already established in Central Asia. Early on, the dominant Mongols offered these\nTurkic groups a deal to either merge with them or suffer harsh reprisal. So as the Mongols progressed\nwestward, their armies gained strength, as more and more of the Turkic tribesmen joined them,\nresulting in armies that were mostly comprised of Turkic peoples, not Mongols. In this manner, the\nTurkic groups absorbed and assimilated the invading Mongols, a process known as Turkification;\nthe conflict between the two cultures faded over time and eventually led to a fusion of Turkic and\nMongolian societies. Over time, these Mongol pastoralists presiding over a sedentary Islamic culture\nslowly Turkified. They quickly became a Mongol minority governing a Turkic majority.\nThere were numerous points of contention between the two groups but also many commonal-\nities. Both societies had originated on the steppe in modern day Mongolia, and, while the Turkic\ngroups had settled down over the years and adopted more of a sedentary existence, many of the\nprinciples of pastoral nomadism still lingered in their culture. Both adhered to a patrimonial\ndistribution of inheritance. Also, both the Turkic groups and the Mongols organized along tribal\nlines, and each followed a pattern of co-opting one tribe into another, thus facilitating a fusion of\nthe Mongols with their Turkic hosts. For this system to work though, the Mongols had to speak\nthe idiom of the people they ruled. So instead of the Mongols imposing their language on the\nmajority of the population, the Mongol elite learned Chagatai, a Turkic tongue.\nFor many years, religion remained the only major distinction between the two societies, but\nonce the Chagataids converted to Islam in 1333 this conspicuous difference disappeared. While\nthe Mongols adopted the creed and language of the Turkic Chagatai, these Turkic peoples incor-\nporated the Mongol political concept of Genghis-Khanid legitimacy.\n11.10 THE KHANATE OF THE ILKHANS (1265 \u2013 1335)\nH\u00fcleg\u00fc Khan (1256 \u2013 1265),\ngrandson of Genghis Khan and\nson of Tolui, served his brother\nM\u00f6ngke (1251 \u2013 1259), the great\nkhan, and campaigned through the\nMiddle East, where he whipped\nout the Assassins, a secret order\nof schismatic Shia entrenched in\nthe mountains of Gilan province\nin 1256. He also destroyed the\nAbbasid capital of Baghdad in 1258,\nputting an end to the Caliphate.\nBy 1260 H\u00fcleg\u00fc controlled parts\nof Armenia, Iraq, Anatolia, all of\nFigure 11.8 | H\u00fcleg\u00fc Khan and Dokuz Khatun | From Rachid\nAzerbaijan, and all of Iran. Kublai Ad-Din\u2019s \u201cHistory of the World\u201d\nKhan (1250 \u2013 1294) had awarded Author: Rachid Ad-Din\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nhis brother H\u00fcleg\u00fc the title of\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 417 Ilkhan, a secondary khan who remained subordinate only to the great khan in Mongolia. This\nportion of the empire became known as the Khanate of the Ilkhans.\nThe Ilkhans were a Mongol minority ruling over a Muslim majority; religious problems plagued\nthe Ilkhanate for much of its existence. To begin with, H\u00fcleg\u00fc, a Nestorian Christian, who later\nconverted to Buddhism on his deathbed, had sacked Baghdad, one of the most politically important\ncities in the Islamic world, an act that alienated him from his Muslim cousin Berke Khan, ruler of\nthe Golden Horde. The conversion of the Golden Horde to Islam had presented a real problem,\nfor the Ilkhans had initially championed Buddhism in Iraq and Iran. As animosity continued to\nmount between the two parts of the Mongol Empire over religious differences, we see growing ties\nof alliance between the Muslim Golden Horde and their coreligionists, the Mamluk Sultanate of\nEgypt, against the Ilkhans. Belief transcended blood, as one part of Mongol Empire allied against\nanother with an outside source. Faith-based civil wars consumed much of the reign of Abaga Khan\n(1265 \u2013 1282). These wars were rooted in the Ilkhanate\u2019s inappropriate treatment of their Muslim\npopulation. The Golden Horde\u2019s alliance with the Mamluks threatened the Ilkhanate, and yet no\nlonger could Abaga rely on the full might of centralized Mongol power; he was forced to appeal to\nKublai Khan to assuage the hostilities between the Ilkhans and the Golden Horde.\nMap 11.11 | Map of the Khanate of the Ilkhans at its Greatest Extent, 1256 CE\nAuthor: Arab League\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 418 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nMuch of the religious conflict during the early\nIlkhanate related to doctrinal differences between\nIslam and the traditional Mongol way of life. The\nmost stubborn problem for the two was the contra-\ndiction between the traditional Mongolian method\nof animal slaughter, which required that no blood\nbe spilled, and the Islamic code of cleanliness, which\nnecessitated that all blood be drained. Each side was\nappalled by the other\u2019s customs. Furthermore, as\npractitioners of rigid monotheism, Muslims found\nthe Mongol worship of religious images repulsive, a\nritual strictly forbidden in Islam.\nWhile spiritual troubles remained a persistent\nproblem for the Ilkhans, the economic situation\ndeteriorated too. Gaykhatu Khan (1291 \u2013 1295)\npractically emptied the royal treasury with profli-\ngate spending. He experimented with paper money\nrecently adopted from China to compensate for his\nFigure 11.9 | Conversion of Ghazan to Islam | wasteful expenditures, but overprinting resulted in\nFrom Rashid al-Din \u201cHistory of the World\u201d\nmassive inflation. The Ilkhans also tried to extract\nAuthor: Rachid Ad-Din\nSource: Wikimedia Commons the maximum amount of tribute from the country-\nLicense: Public Domain side to offset declining revenues. This led to an abuse\nin tax gathering, known as tax farming, in which\nrulers sold contracts for the collection of revenues to the highest bidder. This method of tax col-\nlection provided a strong incentive to despoil peasants.\nIt was Mahmud Ghazan (1295 \u2013 1304) who solved the Ilkhanate\u2019s continued religious and\neconomic problems. He was the first Ilkhan to convert to Islam, thus rehabilitating their image\nin the eyes of their Muslim subjects and making their rule much more acceptable. Their new\npublic stance towards Islam moderated persistent conflict and paved the way for cultural flour-\nishing. Ghazan patronized Ilkhanid art, scholarship, and science. Ilkhanid art reflected Chinese\ninfluence and helped contribute to Persian artistic development. In terms of scholarship, the first\ntrue history of the world was completed under the sponsorship of Mahmud Ghazan. Written by\nRashid al-Din Hamadani (1247 \u2013 1318), the book was richly illustrated with watercolors and\nportraiture in the Chinese style. Through his travels in the service of the Mongols, Rashid al-Din\nhad become perceptively aware of Ilkhanid Persia\u2019s cosmopolitan culture. It was Rashid al-Din,\na Jewish convert to Islam, who had convinced Mahmud Ghazan to adopt the faith in order to be\nmore attuned to the beliefs of his peoples. Regarding science, the Ilkhands attempted to amass\nlarge amounts of astronomical data from China to Europe. With unprecedented accuracy, they\nbecame very good at predicting lunar eclipses. Their data was used throughout Eurasia.\nDespite the early looting and plundering indicative of a Mongol conquest, the Ilkhans even-\ntually reactivated the Silk Road and promoted transcontinental trade. The newfound safety of the\nPage | 419 route throughout Eurasia stimulated trade and encouraged many different kinds of cultures to\ncome together. Ghazan attempted to reform the tax policies that had led to the maximization of\ntaxation. Cities did revive, but the long term negative consequence of conquest continued to be\nfelt by the peasants who suffered from prolonged violence.\nMuch like the Mongols in Chaghatai Central Asia, eventually Ilkhans went native too. Here we\nsee a Persian-Mongol fusion, as they began to identify with Persian culture and speak the Persian\nlanguage. As they bonded with Persia, they adopted Islam and began to promote Persian as the\nwritten language of their land.\n11.11 TIMUR\nIt was under Timur (1370 \u2013 1405) that Central Asia moved to the fore of world events. He\nattempted to soothe the persistent differences that existed between the steppe and sedentary\nsocieties and actually developed a political arrangement that could harness the best attributes of\neach society, without the dangerous side effect of communal violence associated with combining\nthe two civilizations. He also constructed a new political and military machine that was deeply\ningrained in the political background of the Chagatai Khanate, even while he acknowledged that\nInju satisfied neither the nomad nor the settled society and eliminated the practice. Astutely rec-\nognizing that serious conflict existed between these two incongruent cultures under his control,\nTimur provided a framework for both societies to live in harmony.\nBorn in 1336 near Kesh in modern day Uzbekistan, Timur came out of Central Asia and was a\nproduct of the Turko-Mongol fusion. He descended from an aristocratic Mongol clan, but he was\nraised as a Muslim and spoke a Turkic language. Although Timur himself was a native to Transoxiana,\nhe could not assert Genghis-Khanid legitimacy. Unable to trace his ancestry to Genghis Khan, he\ncould not take the title of khan in his own\nright. Timur understood that because he\ndid not have the correct pedigree, he would\nhave to earn it. His solution was to take the\ntitle of emir, meaning commander, and rule\nthrough a Chagatayid puppet khan acting\nas a figurehead. The emir also married into\nthe family of Genghis Khan. While the law\nof descent was not intended to work this\nway, Timur changed it to accommodate\nhis children, who would be able to claim\nGenghis-Khanid legitimacy.\nTo strengthen the security of his position\nas emir, he constructed a system of support\nthat ordered his political connections in a Map 11.12 | Map of the Timurid Empire, 1400 CE\nseries of concentric rings. In his primary Author: User \u201cGabagool\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\ncircle resided his family and close allies.\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 420 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nThe second ring consisted of loyal tribes and Timur\u2019s own Barlas Clan, from which he traced his\nlineage. The third circle was made up of those peoples Timur had defeated on the battlefield; the\nsecond and third rings balanced one another. The outermost bands included Timur\u2019s hereditary\nprofessional administrators and bureaucrats, soldiers from the plains serving in his cavalry units,\nand finally the Persian urban and agricultural populations, from which he recruited his infantry\nand siege units.\nLike many transitional figures in history, such as Suleiman the Magnificent, Timur bridged\nthe medieval and modern worlds. He attempted to imitate Genghis Khan\u2019s success in the field and\ndesigned a novel military machine that was well adapted to the environment in which he lived. His\nmilitary was the product of a Turko-Mongol fusion, employing Turkic siege techniques and the\nMongol cavalry. Unlike Genghis Khan, however, Timur increasingly combined his cavalry, siege,\nand infantry units, placing his heavy cavalry at the center of formations. His army also utilized an\nearly form of artillery. He ventured to monopolize the market on gunpowder technology so that\nother powers could not benefit from it.\nTimur was determined to keep his volatile\narmy occupied, so they would not be a burden\nto the sedentary population in his realm. It was\nin this context that he developed a formula for\nsuccess that promoted peace at home and war\nabroad, a policy that best served the interests of\nthe merchants and townspeople. He externalized\nthe violence of the steppe and destroyed all of the\nother trade routes that bypassed his territory.\nTimur attempted to reactivate and dominate the\nSilk Road and diverted trade to his lands in order\nto help rebuild the cities that had been damaged\nfrom years of Mongol and nomad rule. He did\nnot aim at permanent occupation or the creation\nof new states; he just wanted to devastate, even\ngoing so far as to campaign against the Golden\nHorde, Delhi Sultanate, and the Ottoman Empire,\nall in an effort to redirect trade in his direction.\nTimur began his military campaigns at-\ntempting to secure the back door of the steppe.\nDuring this period, which lasted from 1370 to\n1385, he conquered and subdued Mogholistan\nto the northeast, with the aim of securing the\nFigure 11.10 | Timur Facial Reconstruction | core central land route of the Silk Road. (The\nForensic Facial Reconstruction by M. Gerasimov, 1941 Chagatai Khanate had already been divided into\nAuthor: Shakko\ntwo parts by the 1340s, Transoxania in the west,\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 and Mogholistan in the east.) Then he engaged\nPage | 421 the Golden Horde between 1385 and 1395. The Golden Horde had been the master of the northern\ntrade route that bypassed Timur\u2019s territory. In order to eliminate this option, he went to war\nagainst them in order to divert trade to toward his lands. Timur showed his strategic genius\nin these expeditions. He defeated a steppe power on the steppe. He put the pieces of his army\ntogether in such a way so that he could take his enemies on in their arena and on their terms.\nIn this manner, Timur crushed Tokhtamysh, leader of the Golden Horde, in 1395. During the\ncourse of this campaign, Timur destroyed their principle trade cities of Astrakhan and Sarai. An\ninteresting byproduct of Timur\u2019s campaign against the Golden Horde was that it precipitated the\nrise of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. He had weakened the Golden Horde to such an extent\nthat it made it possible for Moscow to throw off the Mongol yoke.\nTimur raided into India from 1398 to 1399 and dealt a blow to the southern sea route that\nconnected the Occident to the Orient. This expedition was primarily for looting, since he never\nintended to conquer and annex the territory of Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, the\nlast member of the Tughluq Dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. During this campaign, Timur\u2019s tactical\nbrilliance was on full display; he had an uncanny ability to adapt to any martial environment that\nhe confronted. For instance, when threatened with a cavalry of war elephants, Timur responded by\nunleashing a pack of camels laden with incendiary material to charge the enemy lines. Shrieking\ndromedaries with their backs ablaze incited utter pandemonium among Nasir-ud-Din\u2019s cavalry of\nelephants, who rampaged through the sultan\u2019s own lines. Timur easily routed the sultan\u2019s forces.\nWhen faced with the townspeople of Delhi rising up against their aggressors, Timur brutally\nsacked the capital of the sultanate and justified the violence in religious terms. His was a Muslim\nvictory over the Hindu unbelievers of India.\nIn Timur\u2019s final period of conquest, which lasted from 1400 to 1404, he campaigned against the\nIslamic far west, directing his army against the Ottomans. Actually, Timur had initially attempted\nto avoid conflict with the Ottomans, whose forces had earned an impressive reputation on the\nbattlefield. In fact, Timur had even tried to negotiate with Bayezid I, the Ottoman Sultan, offering\nhim part of Golden Horde\u2019s territory west of Dnieper River. But these two expansionist realms\ninevitably came into conflict in eastern Anatolia. The conflict between the two empires began as\nthe Ottomans expanded to the east and took control of some Turkmen tribes in eastern Anatolia\nalready under the protection of Timur. The emir responded by taking some other Turkmen tribes\nunder Ottoman suzerainty. Offensive missives replete with insulting incriminations ensued. Timur\nbided his time, waiting for the perfect moment to attack the Ottomans. In 1402, he launched a\ndevastating attack into the heart of Anatolia, as the Ottomans were preoccupied with campaign-\ning against the Hungarians. During the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Timur managed to convince\nmany of the Ottoman forces to defect to his side. He captured the Ottoman sultan, who died in\ncaptivity three months later. Timur had not attempted to conquer the Ottomans; he just wanted\nto punish them for their unwillingness to cooperate. His Levantine expedition also seems to have\nbeen designed to weaken the western terminus of the Silk Road in Aleppo, Syria.\nTimur died in 1405 while on a campaign against the Ming Dynasty. He had built an empire\nthat spanned the breadth of Central Asia. Unlike Genghis Khan, whose empire continued to\nexpand after his death, the sons of Timur and their followers squabbled over succession, leading\nPage | 422 CHAPTER 11: CENTRAL ASIA\nto a series of internecine battles. Members of the Timurid Dynasty competed among themselves,\nwith commanders switching loyalties. The empire consequently fragmented. The successors of\nTimur could not manage the difficulties of governing an empire, and it withered away quickly. The\npolitical situation resembled that which Chagatayids had to contend with, the steppe military that\nhad been redirected, but with Timur\u2019s death, they returned. A number of Timurid rulers followed;\na weak state emerged from all this strife.\n11.11.1 Terror and Destruction\nTimur certainly committed what we would describe today as war crimes; there definitely was\nan element of terrorism to his campaigns. In fact, as an admirer of architecture, he is known to\nhave constructed pyramids of human skulls. Extant accounts describe him slaughtering 100,000\nIndian prisoners following the Delhi uprising. But not all destruction was the same; and there\nwas a definite difference between that of Genghis Khan and Timur. The emir\u2019s annihilation of the\nregion was not meant to serve a utilitarian purpose so much as to inflict suffering. Genghis Khan\u2019s\nused terror as a method to protect his troops, whereas Timur engaged in terror and destruction\nfor pleasure.\n11.11.2 Legacy\nA product of the Turko-Mongolian fusion, Timur had been the first to reunite the eastern and\nwestern parts of the Chagatai ulus. His empire represents the construction of the political bound-\naries passed down to posterity; the maintenance of this space would define boundaries of modern\nday Central Asia up to the twentieth century. Under Timur we see growing political and cultural\ndistinctions between Iran, Central Asia proper, and India begin to cement. In this context, we see\na split taking place on the steppe that will lead to a differentiation of the Uzbeks and Kazaks. By\nthe late fourteenth century, the tribes on the steppe to the north will become known to Muslim\nwriters as Kazaks, whereas the tribes to the south will be increasingly referred to as Uzbeks, a\ndifferentiation that has continued to persist and helped to delimit modern borders.\n11.12 CONCLUSION\nThree forces combined to shape the course of Central Asian history: the Turkic migrations,\nexpansion of Islam, and the Mongol conquest. Beginning in the second century BCE, waves of\nTurkic migrations entered the region. It is debatable whether or not they Turkified the original\nIranian inhabitants or permanently changed the ethnic makeup of the area. Turkic tribes occupied\nthe great steppe, Turkifying the region and endowing it with a more nomadic character. They also\npopulated the agricultural basin of Transoxiana, displacing the original Iranian inhabitants of the\narea. Many of these Turks slowly settled down over time. These Turkic peoples displayed a unique\nability to absorb the Islamic faith and internalize the Mongol conquest.\nIslam transformed the religious adherence of Central Asia and left a lasting mark on the\nregion as well. Transoxiana gradually Islamicized, but Turkic and Persian cultures persisted.\nPage | 423 Islamization incorporated native peoples in the process of conversion. As Islam spread through\nthe area, the faith demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to incorporate local traditions, permit-\nting some customs to linger so long as doing so accelerated conversion. Sufi missionaries made\nsome compromises with the Turkic nomadic culture in order to establish the religion in the area.\nSufism\u2019s inherent flexibility helped to promote conversion, and the blend of orthodox Islam and\nTurkic pastoral nomadism created a uniquely Central Asian brand of the faith.\nThe Mongol conquest of Central Asia had the most immediate impact on the history of the\nregion. Although the Mongols eventually Turkified over time, the legacy of Genghis-Khanid\nlegitimacy remained. Genghis Khan had developed a secure and dependable means of transferring\npower, for Genghis-Khanid legitimacy reduced the number of contenders vying for the throne;\nthe Mongols did not collapse as a \u201cnation\u201d following the death of their founder. Genghis Khan\nbequeathed a legacy of political legitimacy to the region that would last until 1920.\n11.13 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nAdshead, S.A.M., Central Asia in World History.

Down below the hill on which the mosque stood, a scene of\nslaughter was unfolding. Up against the northern wall of the city stood a wooden tower laboriously\nrolled into place hours earlier, over the top of which had poured a desperate band of European\nknights, the first over the walls of the Holy City.\nWithin the walls, the narrow, winding streets between the ancient stone buildings of the city\nrang with the clash of steel on steel and the cries of the dead and dying. Smoke from fires breaking\nout within the city mingled with the smell of death. In parts of the city, its defenders, Muslim\nEgyptians, were still fighting, going down under the sword strokes of the Christian soldiers fighting\ntheir way through the streets. In the southwest, a small group of defenders had retreated into the\nmore heavily fortified citadel where they were negotiating a surrender with Count Raymond of\nToulouse, a shrewd but irascible noble from the south of France.\nElsewhere in the city, the killing of the soldiers was giving way to a more horrific slaughter, as\nthe mail-clad knights cut down men, women, and children where they stood, torturing some with\nfire, and threatening others with worse if they did not turn over their valuables. By the end of the\nday, the Christian soldiers hacking their way through the city streets waded through blood up to\ntheir ankles.\nAs the day went on, soldiers pushed through the piles of dismembered corpses to the gold-\nen-domed Al-Aqsa Mosque. The mosque stood where Solomon\u2019s temple had been millennia\nbefore, and the knights, smeared with the blood of slaughter, fell to their knees in prayer, grateful\nthat God had delivered their enemies into their hands.\nThese men had traveled more than two thousand miles by land and sea. Tens of thousands\nof their comrades lay dead along the way from starvation, thirst, disease, or battle. But these\nPage | 428 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nwarriors had made it from their European homelands to seize control of the city of Jerusalem, a\ncity sacred to Jew, Christian, and Muslim, and bring it under Christian rule for the first time in\nmore than four centuries.\nAn army made up of many of the soldiers of Western Europe had managed to successfully\nmake war on its Muslim enemies and seize territories in the Middle East, near the heart of Muslim\nculture and political power. How had they done so? And why? To understand, we must look to the\nhow the European Christian world had developed over the eleventh century.\nIn the years between about 1000 and 1500, the culture and institutions of Western Europe\ntook on a form that was distinct from the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms of the early Middle\nAges and which would, in many ways, lay the foundations of Europe (and the Americas) into\nmodern times. At the end of this period, thinkers seeking to bring about a new birth of ancient\nlearning would look back on the thousand years that had come before as the Middle Ages, a\nperiod between the world of the Ancient Greeks and Romans and their own. But although\nthese thinkers ostentatiously rejected the Middle Ages, they were in many ways its heirs. To see\nhow this culture developed, we shall begin in Western Europe in the chaotic years of the early\neleventh century.\n12.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING\n1.

In the aftermath of the Abbasid Caliphate\u2019s political\ncollapse and the gradual weakening of Fatimid Egypt (see Chapter Eight), the eleventh-century\nByzantine Empire was the strongest, most centralized state in the Eastern Mediterranean, and\nindeed, probably the strongest state west of Song China.\nMost of the rest of Christian Western Europe\u2019s kingdoms, however, were fragmented.\nThis decentralization was most acute in West Francia, the western third of what had been\nPage | 430 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nCharlemagne\u2019s empire. This kingdom would eventually come to be known as France. Out of a\nweak and fragmented kingdom emerged the decentralized form of government that historians\noften call feudalism. We call it feudalism because power rested with armed men in control of\nplots of agricultural land known as fiefs and Latin for fief is feudum. They would use the surplus\nfrom these fiefs to equip themselves with weapons and equipment, and they often controlled their\nfiefs with little oversight from the higher-ranked nobles or the king.\nHow had such a system emerged? Even in Carolingian times, armies in much of Western\nEurope had come from war bands made up of a king\u2019s loyal retainers, who themselves would\npossess bands of followers. Ultimate control of a kingdom\u2019s army had rested with the king, and the\ngreat nobles had also exercised strong authority over their own fighting men. The near constant\nwarfare (both external attacks and civil wars) of the tenth and eleventh centuries, however, meant\nthat the kings of West Francia gradually lost control over the more powerful nobles. Further, the\npowerful nobles often lost control of the warlords of more local regions. West Francia had little\ngovernmental authority and much war.\nAs a result of constant warfare (albeit warfare that was usually local in scope), power came to\nrest in control of fiefs and the ability to extract surplus from their occupants and to use this surplus\nto outfit armed men. The warlords who controlled fiefs often did so by means of armed fortresses\ncalled castles. At first, especially in northern parts\nof West Francia, these fortresses were of wood,\nand might sometimes be as small as a wooden\npalisade surrounding a fortified wooden tower.\nOver the eleventh and twelfth centuries, these\nwooden castles came to be replaced with fortifi-\ncations of stone. A castle had two roles: it would\nprotect a land from attackers (such as Viking\nraiders), but it would also serve as a base for the\ncontrol and extortion of a land\u2019s people.\nThe castle represented Europe\u2019s feudal\norder in wood and stone. Corresponding to the\nphysical structure of the castle was the figure of\nthe knight. Knights in the eleventh century wore\nan armor called chain mail, that is, interlocking\nrings of metal that would form a coat of armor.\nThe knight usually fought on horseback, wielding\na long spear known as a lance in addition to the\nsword at his side. With his feet resting in stirrups,\na knight could hold himself firmly in the saddle,\ndirecting the weight and power of a charging Figure 12.1 | A Wooden Castle of the Type\nhorse into the tip of his lance. that was Common in the Eleventh Century\nAuthor: Julien Chatelain\nKnights and castles came to dominate West\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nFrancia and then other parts of Europe for several License: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 431 reasons. The technology of ironworking\nwas improving so that iron was cheaper\n(although still very expensive) and more\nreadily available, allowing for knights to\nwear more armor than their predecessors.\nMoreover, warfare of the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies was made up of raids (both those\nof Vikings and of other Europeans). A raid\ndepends on mobility, with the raiders able\nto kill people and seize plunder before\ndefending soldiers can arrive. Mounted on\nhorseback, knights were mobile enough\nFigure 12.2 | Rochester Castle | A stone castle built in\nthat they could respond rapidly to raids.\nthe twelfth century.\nThe castle allowed a small number of Author: User \u201cPrioryman\u201d\nsoldiers to defend territory and was also Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\na deterrent to raiders, since it meant that\nquick plunder might not be possible.\nA knight\u2019s equipment\u2014mail, lance, and horse\u2014was incredibly expensive, as was the material\nand labor to construct even a wooden castle. Although knights had originally been whichever\nsoldiers had been able to get the equipment to fight, the expense of this equipment and thus the\nneed to control a fief to pay for it meant that knights gradually became a warrior aristocracy, with\ngreater rights than the peasants whose labor they controlled. Indeed, often the rise of knights\nand castles meant that many peasants lost their freedom, becoming serfs, unfree peasants who,\nalthough not property that could be bought and sold like slaves, were nevertheless bound to their\nland and subordinate to those who controlled it.\nFigure 12.3 | Eleventh-Century Knights\nAuthor: User \u201cMyrabella\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 432 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nThe regions of West Francia controlled by powerful nobles were nearly independent of the\ncrown. But even at the Frankish monarchy\u2019s weakest, these nearly independent nobles were\nunderstood to hold their territories from the king and to owe allegiance to him if he called on them\nfor military service. In this way, feudalism of the European Middle Ages resembled Western Zhou\nfeudalism. The smaller fiefs that made up the territories of these great nobles likewise were under-\nstood to be held from these nobles; the knight who held a fief was, at least in theory, required to\nrender military service to the lord from whom he held it. In practice, though, the kingdom of West\nFrancia (and other regions of Western Europe where such a system held sway) had little cohesion\nas a state, with most functions of a state like minting money, building roads and bridges, and\ntrying and executing criminals in the hands of the powerful nobles.\n12.5.1 Global Context\nThus far, we have discussed feudalism in eleventh-century Western Europe, but a decentral-\nized state dominated by a warrior aristocracy could emerge anywhere that central authority broke\ndown. A similar system emerged in Heian Japan of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when\nmounted soldiers (in this case samurai rather than knights) came to occupy the social role of a\nwarrior aristocracy (see Chapter Four). Such an arrangement would emerge at the same time\nin the Middle East: the Great Saljuq Empire was dominated by mounted warriors in control of\niqtas, units of land whose revenues (often from taxation) would fund these warriors, who in turn\nheld their iqtas from the sultan.\n12.6 GROWTH OF TOWNS AND TRADE\nAlthough the eleventh century was in many ways Western Europe\u2019s nadir, it would also see\nthe beginnings of Western Europe\u2019s re-urbanization. One reason for these beginnings was that\nin those lands that had been part of the Western Roman Empire, city walls often remained, even\nif these cities had largely emptied of people. During the chaos and mayhem of the tenth and\neleventh centuries, people often gathered in walled settlements for protection. Many of these old\nwalled cities thus came to be re-occupied.\nAnother reason for the growth of towns came with a revival of trade in the eleventh century.\nThis revival of trade can be traced to several causes. In the first place, Europe\u2019s knights, as a\nwarrior aristocracy, had a strong demand for luxury goods, both locally manufactured products\nand imported goods such as silks and spices from Asia. Bishops, the great lords of the Church,\nhad a similar demand. As such, markets grew up in the vicinity of castles and thus caused the\nformation of towns that served as market centers, while cathedral cities also saw a growth of\npopulation. Moreover, Viking raids had also led to a greater sea-borne trade in the North Sea and\nAtlantic. Often, Viking-founded markets served as the nucleus of new towns, especially in those\nlands where the Romans had never established a state and which were not urbanized at all. The\nIrish city of Dublin, for example, had begun as a Viking trading post.\nFurther south, in the Mediterranean, frequent raids by pirates (most of whom were Arab\nMuslims from North Africa) had forced the coastal cities of Italy to build effective navies. One of\nPage | 433 the chief of these cities was Venice,\na city in the swamps and lagoons of\nnortheastern Italy. Over the eleventh\ncentury, the city (formerly under\nByzantine rule but now independent)\nhad built up a navy that had cleared\nthe Adriatic Sea of pirates and\nestablished itself as a nexus of trade\nbetween Constantinople and the rest\nof Western Europe. Likewise, on the\nwestern side of Italy, the cities of\nGenoa and Pisa had both built navies\nfrom what had been modest fishing\nfleets and seized the strongholds\nof Muslim pirates in the islands of\nCorsica and Sardinia. This clearing of\nFigure 12.4 | Medieval Market, Fifteenth Century\npirates from the Mediterranean led\nAuthor: Nicole Oreseme\nSource: Wikimedia Commons to an increase in maritime trade and\nLicense: Public Domain allowed the renewed growth of the\nold Roman towns that had in many\ncases remained since the fall of the Western Empire. The cities of Genoa and Venice were able\nto prosper because they stood at the northernmost points of the Mediterranean, the farthest that\ngoods could be moved by water (always cheaper than overland transport in premodern times)\nbefore going over land to points further north.\nAs goods moved north and south between the trade zones of the North Sea and the\nMediterranean, nobles along that north-south route realized that they could enrich themselves\nby taxing markets. They thus sponsored and protected markets in regions of West Francia like\nChampagne, which themselves would serve as centers of urbanization and economic activity.\nThe people living and working in towns came to be known as the bourgeois, or middle class.\nThese were called a middle class because they were neither peasant farmers nor nobles, but rather\na social rank between the two. Kings and other nobles would frequently give towns the right to\nself-government, often in exchange for a hefty payment. A self-governing town was often known\nas a commune.\n12.7 GROWTH IN AGRICULTURE\nEleventh-century Europe\u2019s economy was primarily agricultural. The eleventh and twelfth\ncenturies saw a massive expansion of agricultural output in the northern regions of Europe, which\nled to a corresponding growth in the economy and population. The same improvement in iron tech-\nnology that allowed the equipping of armored knights led to more iron tools: axes allowed famers\nto clear forests and cultivate more land, and the iron share of a heavy plow allowed farmers to plow\nPage | 434 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\ndeeper into the thick soil of Western Europe. In addition, farmers gradually moved to a so-called\nthree field system of agriculture: fields would have one third given over to cereal crops, one third\nto crops such as legumes (which increase fertility in soil), and a third left fallow, i.e., uncultivated\neither to serve as grazing land for livestock or simply rebuild its nutrients by lying unused. More\niron tools and new agricultural techniques caused yields to rise from 3:1 to nearly 8:1 and in some\nfertile regions even higher. Another factor in the rise of agricultural yields was Europe\u2019s climate,\nwhich was becoming warmer in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. As a result of both\nclimate and new agricultural tools and techniques, food supplies increased so that Western Europe\nwould go through the majority of the twelfth century without experiencing a major famine.\nWe should note that at the same\ntime that agricultural yields were\nrising in Europe, so too were they on\nthe rise in Song China (see Chapter\nFour). Indeed, compared to China,\nEurope\u2019s agricultural production was\nstill relatively meager. It was neverthe-\nless enough to bring about a dramatic Figure 12.5 | A Heavy Plow\ngrowth in Europe\u2019s population. Author: Unknown\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\n12.8 A ROMAN EMPIRE?\nAlthough the Carolingian Empire had collapsed in the ninth century and West Francia\nremained fragmented, in Central Europe, the rulers of East Francia formed a new empire on the\nwreck of Charlemagne\u2019s. King Otto I of East Francia had defeated the Magyars in 955 (see Chapter\nSeven), and both Otto and his powerful nobles further subordinated the Slavic peoples to the east\nto his rule, forcing them either to submit to his direct rule or acknowledge him as their overlord.\nHe followed up on the prestige gained from his victory over the Magyars by exercising influence\nin Northern Italy, intervening in a dispute between Pope John XII (r. 955 \u2013 964) and Berengar,\na petty king. On 2 February 962, Pope John XII crowned Otto as Roman Emperor in a ceremony\nmeant to echo Pope Leo III\u2019s crowning of Charlemagne over a century and a half before. Further,\nOtto deposed Berengar and added Italy to his domains.\nOtto was the most powerful ruler in Europe besides the Byzantine emperor. His empire covered\nmost of the German-speaking lands of Central Europe: indeed, Otto and its subsequent emperors\nwould be Germans and the power base of this empire would be firmly Central European. This\nempire also encompassed northern Italy and much of the territory west of the Rhine. The rulers\nof this empire would call themselves Roman Emperors and consider themselves the successors\nto Charlemagne and thus to the Roman Empire. This empire, however, was more modest than\nCharlemagne\u2019s. Although its emperors would claim that all Christian kings owed them obedience,\nmost other realms of Western Europe were independent, especially West Francia (which we\nshall hereafter refer to as France). Likewise, this empire\u2019s control of Northern Italy was always\nsomewhat tenuous, since its rulers\u2019 power was based in Germany, far to the north of the Alps.\nPage | 435 Map 12.1 | Europe and the Mediterranean in 1054 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nBecause these emperors considered themselves to be Roman Emperors and also protectors\nof the Church\u2014indeed, Otto I eventually deposed Pope John XII for improperly fulfilling his\npapal duties\u2014historians call their empire the Holy Roman Empire and its emperors Holy Roman\nEmperors. The reader should carefully note that these emperors did not use either of those titles.\nThey simply referred to themselves as Roman Emperors and their empire as the Roman Empire.\nWe call the Empire the Holy Roman Empire and the emperors Holy Roman Emperors for the\nconvenience of modern readers, so that they will know that they are reading about neither the\nRoman Empire, which dominated the entirety of the Mediterranean world in ancient times, nor\nthe Byzantine Empire, a regional power in the Eastern Mediterranean for most of the Middle Ages.\nPage | 436 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\n12.9 THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE\u2019S PERIPHERIES: SECONDARY\nSTATE FORMATION\nAnthropologists speak of secondary state formation, a process by which people who live\nin a tribe or chiefdom on the periphery of a state will gradually adopt statehood and the ideological\ntrappings associated with statehood. Oftentimes this state formation happens because a people\nwill need to match the resources of a state for raising armed forces, or because a chief will seek the\ngreater prestige and power that comes from being recognized as a king.\nIn Scandinavia and in Eastern Europe, state formation occurred on the margins of the Holy\nRoman Empire. In the late tenth century, the Danes, the Poles (a Slavic people), and the Magyars\nformed the kingdoms of Denmark, Poland, and Hungary, respectively. These kingdoms were\noften vassal states (i.e., subordinate states) of the Ottonian emperors, but they just as often\nfought to maintain their independence when they had the capability to do so. Another key factor\nin the move from chiefdoms to states was the adoption of Christianity: the Christian religion, as\nwe have seen earlier (see Chapter Seven), often legitimated a king. The Christian Bible says that\na prince is God\u2019s instrument of executing justice.1 In exchange for their legitimation, monarchs\nwould protect the institutional Church. We can see this relationship between Christianity and\nsecondary state formation when King Stephen I of Hungary received his crown from the papacy\nin the year 1000.\nFar to the north, in Norway, a land of narrow fjords and valleys surrounded by pine-covered\nmountains, King Olaf II was following a similar set of policies. A Christian who had converted in\n1013 while fighting in France, he spent his reign as king of Norway (1015 \u2013 1030) both consolidating\nNorway into a kingdom that recognized royal authority and converting that kingdom to Christianity.\n12.9.1 Global Context\nIn Northern and Eastern Europe, secondary state formation had gone hand in hand with the\nadoption of Christianity, which legitimated kings and whose clergy, familiar with the written word,\nprovided the skills of literacy to monarchs. A similar pattern occurred elsewhere in the world,\nparticularly in the African Sahel (see Chapter Nine). In Africa\u2019s Sahel, between the tenth and\nthirteenth centuries, as Ghana and then later Mali consolidated into states, their rulers converted\ntheir people to Islam, which provided a similar aid to state-building that Christianity did to the\nrulers of Northern and Eastern Europe.\n12.10 EXPANSION OF CHRISTENDOM\nIn the Middle Ages, the people of Western Europe did not think of Europe as a geographic and\ncultural area. Rather, they thought of Christendom, those peoples and nations of the world that\nembraced the Christian religion, as a community sharing common ideals and assumptions. We\nmight compare it to the Muslim notion of Dar al-Islam (see Chapter Eight). And in the eleventh\ncentury, Christendom expanded. Not only had the peoples to the north and east embraced\n1 Romans 13:4\nPage | 437 Christianity, but also Christian peoples and kingdoms in the Western Mediterranean expanded\nmilitarily at the expense of Islam. In Spain, the movement of the Christian kingdoms of northern\nSpain to expand their territory at the expense of Muslim al-Andalus would come to be known as\nthe Reconquista, the reconquest. It was known as the re-conquest because there had been a\nChristian kingdom in Spain in the sixth and seventh centuries that had fallen to Muslim invaders\nin 711. Christians would thus have assumed that Spain, even though much of it might be Muslim\nruled, was rightfully Christian. The effort by the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula to\ndominate, conquer, and re-Christianize al-Andalus would become a key element in how Spanish\nChristians understood their identity both as Christians and Spaniards.\nHow did the Reconquista begin? From the Muslim conquest of Spain in 711 through the early\neleventh century, al-Andalus was the dominant military power of the Iberian Peninsula, with\nChristian kingdoms confined to the marginal, mountainous regions of the peninsula\u2019s north (see\nChapter Eight). But in 1008, Abd al-Rahman (also known as Sanjul), the caliph\u2019s chief adviser,\nsought to make himself caliph and replace the Umayyad dynasty with his own. The result was\nnearly three decades of civil war. The Cordoba Caliphate collapsed in 1031, fracturing into what\nwe refer to as the taifa states, a set of small, politically weak states. These states were much\nweaker than the centralized Cordoba Caliphate and so were easy prey for potential conquerors\nfrom both the Christian north of the Iberian Peninsula and the Islamic Maghreb.\nThe Christian kingdoms of Spain had several strengths that enabled them to expand at the\nexpense of the taifa states. In the first place, the taifa states were not only politically weak, but they\nwere also at odds with each other. In addition, the construction of stone castles in newly-conquered\nterritories allow the Christian kings to secure their conquests. Moreover, the Christian kingdoms\nof Spain could draw on much\nof the rest of Western Europe\nfor manpower. By the eleventh\ncentury, the knight who inherited\na fief would usually be the oldest\nson of the fief\u2019s lord. This arrange-\nment meant that Western Europe\nhad many knights who, as younger\nsons, had not inherited from their\nfathers (inheritance nearly always\npassed to males). These landless\nknights were looking either for\nemployment or fiefs of their own.\nNew conquests along the frontier\nof Muslim Spain thus gave them\nthe perfect opportunity to seize\nFigure 12.6 | Twelfth-Century Spanish castle their own lands. As a result,\nAuthor: User \u201cSuperchilum\u201d\nFrench knights flowed south in a\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0 steady stream across the Pyrenees.\nPage | 438 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nIn Southern Italy, a group of knights from the region of France known as Normandy (and\nwho were thus called Normans) had fought in the employ of the Byzantine emperors against the\nMuslim rulers of North Africa and Sicily. They eventually broke with the Byzantine Emperors and\ncreated the Kingdom of Sicily, a kingdom comprised of Sicily and Southern Italy, the lands that\nthey had seized from both the Byzantines and Sicilian Muslims, with the last Muslim territory\nin Sicily conquered in 1091. These knights too had come south to the Mediterranean in search of\nnew lands.\nThe Christian kingdoms of both Spain and Sicily were relatively tolerant of their Muslim\nsubjects. Although Muslims under Christian rule faced civil disabilities similar to the dhimmi status\nof Jews and Christians in Muslim-ruled lands, they had a broad array of rights and protections.\nIndeed, the Christian kings of Sicily often employed Muslim mercenaries in their military service.\nThese victories by Christian forces over Muslims would be of great interest to the popes,\nwho were seeking to reform the Church and to find ways that knights could be made to serve\nChristian society.\n12.11 CHURCH REFORM IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY\nBy the eleventh century, Europe suffered from frequent violence and the Church itself was in\na sorry state: Pope John XII, for example, the man who had crowned Otto I, was so infamous for\nhis immorality that it was said that under his rule the papal palace (called the Lateran) was little\nbetter than a brothel. From the mid-eleventh century, both popes and other clergymen would\nseek to reform both the institutional structures of the Church and Christian society as a whole.\nThe Holy Roman Emperor Henry III (r. 1039 \u2013 1056) set the reforming papacy into motion. In\n1049, he had traveled to Rome to be crowned emperor. When he arrived in the city, he found three\nmen claiming to be pope, each supported by a family of Roman nobles. The outraged emperor\ndeposed all three and replaced them with his own candidate, Pope Leo IX (r. 1049 \u2013 1054). Leo IX\nwould usher in a period in which reformers dominated the papacy.\nThese popes believed that to reform the Church, they would need to do so as its unquestioned\nleaders and that the institutional Church should be independent from control of laypeople. The\nposition of pope had long been a prestigious one: Peter, the chief of Jesus Christ\u2019s disciples had,\naccording to the Christian tradition, been the first bishop of Rome, the city in which he had been\nkilled. Eleventh-century popes increasingly argued that since Peter had been the chief of Jesus\u2019s\nfollowers (and thus the first pope), the whole Church owed the popes the obedience that the\ndisciples had owed Peter, who himself had been given his authority by Christ.\nSuch a position was in many ways revolutionary. In the Byzantine Empire, the emperors often\ndirected the affairs of the Church (although such attempts frequently went badly wrong as with\nthe Iconoclast Controversy). Western European kings appointed bishops, and the Holy Roman\nEmperors believed that they had the right to both appoint and depose popes. To claim the Church\nwas independent of lay control went against centuries of practice.\nMoreover, not all churchmen recognized the absolute authority of the pope. The pope was one\nof five churchmen traditionally known as patriarchs, the highest ranking bishops of the Church.\nPage | 439 The pope was the patriarch of Rome; the other four were the patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch,\nJerusalem, and Alexandria. With Jerusalem and Alexandria (and often Antioch) under Muslim\nrule, the patriarch of Constantinople was the most prestigious of the Eastern Orthodox patriarchs,\ndwelling in a city that was Rome\u2019s successor. The patriarchs of Constantinople believed that the\nRoman pope had a place of honor because Peter had resided in Rome, but they did not believe he\nhad any authority over other patriarchs.\n12.11.1 The Filioque Controversy and the Split between Rome and\nConstantinople\nThis difference of opinion as to the authority of the pope would eventually break out in conflict.\nThe church following the pope (which we will refer to as the Catholic Church for the sake of conve-\nnience), had a creed in its liturgy that said that God the Holy Spirit proceeds both from God the\nFather and from God the Son. The Eastern Orthodox version of this creed spoke of God the Holy\nSpirit as proceeding only from God the Father. Representatives of both churches quarreled over\nthis wording, with the popes attempting to order the Orthodox Churches to state that the Holy\nSpirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son in their creed. We thus call this controversy the\nFilioque Controversy, since Latin for \u201cand from the Son\u201d is filioque.\nOn 16 July 1054, Humbert of Silva Candida, the pope\u2019s legate (i.e., ambassador) together with\nhis entourage stormed into the Hagia Sophia as the patriarch was celebrating Communion and\nhurled a parchment scroll onto the altar; the scroll decreed the patriarch to be excommunicated. In\nresponse, the patriarch excommunicated the pope. Catholic and Orthodox churches were now split.\n12.11.2 Simony and the Investiture Controversy\nIn spite of the schism between Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the popes turned to reforming\nthe Church in the Catholic west. Two pressing concerns of the popes were the elimination of\nsimony, the buying and selling of Church offices, and the protection of the Church\u2019s indepen-\ndence from laypeople. The fight of the reforming popes to assert the Church\u2019s independence led to\nthe Investiture Controversy, the conflict between the popes and Holy Roman Emperors (and\nother kings of Western Europe) over who had the right to appoint churchmen.\nTo understand the Investiture Controversy, we need to understand the nature of a medieval\nbishop\u2019s power and authority. A bishop in medieval Europe was a Church leader, with a cathedral\nchurch and a palace. A medieval bishop would also hold lands with fiefs on these lands (and\nmilitary obligations from those who held these fiefs), just like any great noble.\nThe Holy Roman Emperors believed that they had the right to appoint bishops both because\na bishop held lands from the emperor and because the emperors believed themselves to be the\nleaders of all Christendom. The reforming popes of the eleventh century, particularly Pope Gregory\nVII (r. 1073 \u2013 1085), objected to this belief. These popes believed that, since their authority as\npopes came from God, their spiritual authority was superior to the earthly authority of any king\nor prince. They further claimed their right to be independent rulers of the Papal States in Central\nItaly, based on the Donation of Constantine (see Chapter Seven).\nPage | 440 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nGregory VII was up against a man just as strong willed as\nhe in the person of Emperor Henry IV (r. 1056 \u2013 1106). From\n1075, their relationship became increasingly adversarial\nas each claimed the exclusive right to appoint and depose\nbishops. Eventually, this conflict burst into open flame when\nHenry claimed that Gregory was in fact not rightfully pope\nat all and attempted to appoint his own pope. In response,\nGregory proclaimed that none of Henry\u2019s subjects had a duty\nto obey him and encouraged his subjects to rise in rebellion.\nWithout the Church to legitimate Henry IV, his empire\ncollapsed into civil war. As a result, Henry took a small band\nof followers and, in the dead of winter, crossed the Alps,\nbraving the snowy, ice-covered passes to negotiate with the\npope in person. In January, he approached the mountain\ncastle of Canossa where the pope was staying and begged\nGregory for forgiveness, waiting outside of the pope\u2019s\ncastle on his knees in the snow for three days.

The compromise was that clergy\nwould choose bishops, but that the emperor could decide\ndisputed elections. A bishop would receive his lands from the\nemperor in one ceremony, and the emblems of his spiritual\nauthority from the pope in another. Other kings of Western\nEurope reached similar compromises with the papacy.\nThe results of half a century of papal reform efforts were\nmixed. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches had split with\none another, and tensions remain between the two to this\nday. Although the popes failed to achieve everything they\nsought, they did gain limited independence of the Church,\nand they succeeded almost completely in ending the practice\nof simony. Indeed, one contrast between Western Europe\nand much of the rest of the world is a strong sense of separa-\ntion between secular and sacred authority. That separation Figure 12.8 | Emperor Henry IV\nAuthor: Unknown\nof Church and state owes much to the troubled years of the\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nInvestiture Controversy.

It dominated the Eastern Mediterranean, with its emperors reigning\nfrom Constantinople, a city full of magnificent churches, splendid palaces, and centuries-old\nmonuments of an ancient empire.\nMap 12.2 | The Eastern Mediterranean in 1096 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nPage | 442 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nBut these outward signs of strength concealed several weaknesses. In the first place, the theme\nsystem (see Chapter Seven) had begun to break down. The plots of land used to equip soldiers\nhad gradually given way to large estates held by powerful aristocrats. These powerful aristocrats\noften paid less and less in taxes, starving the state of key resources. The theme soldiers themselves\nwere used less often (and when they did fight, they were often poorly trained and equipped), with\nthe emperors relying on mercenaries for most of their fighting. The civilian aristocracy and the\nmilitary were often at loggerheads.\nThe Byzantine emperors of the later eleventh century were nevertheless able to hold their own\nagainst external threats until the arrival of the Saljuq Turks in the Middle East (see Chapters Eight\nand Eleven). Both the Byzantine emperor Romanos IV (r. 1068 \u2013 1071) and the Saljuq sultan Alps\nArslan (r. 1063 \u2013 1072) sought to control the Caucasus Mountains, whose passes controlled access\nto the Middle East from the Central Asian steppes. Control of this route was especially important as\nthe steppes served as a source from which the Turks in the Middle East could recruit more fighters.\nByzantine and Turk finally clashed. Romanos sought to break the Turkish threat on his eastern\nflank and so mustered an immense army. This army consisted both of soldiers of the themes and\nmercenary units drawn from many different peoples: Western Europeans, Cumans and Pechenegs\nfrom the steppes, Scandinavians, and Turks.\nBoth the heterogeneity of this army and the\ndysfunctional politics of the eleventh-cen-\ntury Byzantine Empire would prove to be\nRomanos\u2019s undoing.\nOn 19 August 1071, the forces of the\nByzantine Empire met those of the Great\nSaljuq Empire at the Battle of Manzikert\nnear the shores of Lake Van in Armenia.\nThe thematic troops were of indifferent\nquality, but worse for the emperor was the\ntreachery of both the Byzantine commander\nAndronikos Doukas and the Byzantine\nforce\u2019s Turkic mercenaries. The Byzantine\nfield army was annihilated. The emperor\nhimself was surrounded and taken captive\nafter his elite guard of Norse mercenaries\nwent down fighting in his defense.\nThe result was a catastrophe for the\nEmpire. Not only had most of the Byzantine\nArmy been wiped out, but also competing\nByzantine nobles took the opportunity of the\nemperor\u2019s captivity to launch their own bids Figure 12.9 | Alexios Komnenos\nAuthor: User \u201cEloquence\u201d\nfor power. During the decade of civil war\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthat followed, the Empire\u2019s holdings in Asia License: Public Domain\nPage | 443 Minor almost all fell under the dominion of the Saljuq Turks. What had been the world\u2019s most\npowerful Christian state now faced destruction.\nEventually, Alexios Komnenos (r. 1081 \u2013 1118) would seize control of the Byzantine Empire\nand laboriously rebuild its military strength. Alexios was an able and clever military commander\nwho also possessed good long-term sense. He used the tax base of the Empire\u2019s Balkan posses-\nsions to fund a new army, one composed largely of foreign mercenaries and a small core of Greek\nsoldiers. These indigenous soldiers were often granted out blocks of lands known as pronoiai\n(singular pronoia) whose revenues they would use to equip themselves and their soldiers; a\npronoia was similar to a fief in Western Europe. He also recruited steppe peoples, such as the\nCumans and Pechenegs, into his forces. Another group of peoples from which he recruited merce-\nnaries was Western Europeans, particularly from the Holy Roman Empire and West Francia. In\nMarch of 1095, he sent a request to the pope for military assistance. The long-term consequences\nof this request would be earth-shaking.\n12.12.2 The First Crusade\nThe pope who received Alexios Komnenos\u2019s request for help was Urban II (r. 1088 \u2013 1099),\nan associate of reformers like Gregory VII. Churchmen seeking to reform society had looked to\nquell the violence that was often frequent in Western Europe (especially in France): this violence\nwas usually the work of knights. These reformers were considering how knights could turn their\naggression to pursuits that were useful to Christian society rather than preying upon civilians.\nFighting against Muslims in Sicily and Spain showed the popes an example of knightly aggression\ndirected towards Christendom\u2019s external enemies (see Chapter Eight).\nIn addition, the Church had long recognized Roman Law\u2019s concept of Just War: a war could\nbe moral as long as it was defensive, declared by a rightful authority, and likely to cause less\ndamage than if the war had not occurred. By the eleventh century, certain churchmen had further\nformulated this idea into one of Holy War, that is to say, that a war fought in defense of the\nChurch was not only morally right, but even meritorious.\nThe final element that led to Pope Urban II\u2019s turning much of the military might of Western\nEurope to the Middle East was the idea of Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem was where Jesus Christ\nwas said to have been crucified, to have died, and to have risen from the dead (see Chapter Six). As\nsuch, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built on what was said to be the empty tomb from which Christ\nhad risen was the holiest Church in the Christian world\u2014and this Church had been under the control\nof Muslims since Caliph Umar\u2019s conquest of Palestine in the seventh century (see Chapter Eight). The\ncity remained important to Christians, however, and, even while it was under Muslim rule, they had\ntraveled to it as pilgrims, that is, travelers undertaking a journey for religious purposes.\nPope Urban thus conceived of the idea of turning the military force of Western Europe to both\nshore up the strength of the flagging Byzantine Empire (a Christian state), and return Jerusalem\nand the Church of the Holy Sepulcher to Christian rule after four centuries of Muslim domination.\nOn 27 November 1095, he gathered several of the major nobles of Western Europe (as well as\nmany lower-ranked knights) to an open-air sermon at Clermont, where he was presiding over a\nPage | 444 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nChurch council. In this sermon, he proclaimed that it was the duty of these warrior aristocrats, as\nChristians, to defend the Byzantine Empire and to put the city of Jerusalem under Christian rule.\nThe result was an enthusiastic response by those knights, who are said to have cried out, \u201cGod\nwills it!\u201d and to have vowed to set off to Jerusalem and bring it under Christian rule. Furthermore,\nas word of Pope Urban\u2019s admonition spread throughout Western Europe, more and more of the\nknightly class answered the call, mustering under the leadership of several powerful nobles.\nThis movement of the knights of most of Western Europe to fight against Muslims in the\nMiddle East is generally known as the first of a series of Crusades. A crusade was a war declared\nby the papacy against those perceived to be enemies of the Christian faith (usually, but not always,\nMuslims). Participating in a crusade would grant a Christian forgiveness of sins. We ought to note\nthat such a concept in many ways superficially resembled the Muslim notion of the Lesser Jihad\n(see Chapter Eight).\nAs these forces mustered and marched south and east, the religious enthusiasm accompanying\nthem often spilled out into aggression against non-Christians other than Muslims. One group\nMap 12.3 | The Crusader States | These regions were known to Western Europeans as Outremer, Old French for\n\u201cacross the sea\u201d\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov.

The first traveled to the\nByzantine Empire, and was ferried\nacross the Bosporus but was wiped out\nby a Turkish army. The second wave,\nhowever, was better planned and coor-\ndinated, and, upon its arrival in the\nByzantine Empire, reached an uneasy\nFigure 12.10 | Crusader Castle at Byblos\ntruce with the Alexios Komnenos (who\nAuthor: User \u201cHeretiq\u201d\nhad been expecting a modest force of Source: Wikimedia Commons\nmercenaries and not the armed might License: CC BY-SA 2.5\nof most of Western Europe). The\nCrusaders were fortunate. After Nizaris had assassinated Nizam al-Mulk and the Fatimid caliph\nof Egypt had died (both in 1092), the Middle East fell into political chaos (see Chapter Eight).\nWhen the Crusaders marched east in 1096, they encountered not a unified Great Saljuq Empire,\nbut a collection of independent and semi-independent sultans and emirs.\nThe Crusaders moved east, winning a string of victories in Asia Minor: when they could not\nbe outmaneuvered, the armored knights of Western Europe often stood at an advantage against\nthe lightly armored or unarmored mounted archers that mostly made up the bulk of Turkish\nforces. Following the path of the crusading army, Alexios was able to restore much of western\nAsia Minor to the control of the Byzantine Empire, although the central Anatolian plateau would\nremain under the dominion of the Saljuq Turks. The Crusaders advanced on Antioch, the largest\nand most prosperous city of the Levant, and, after a siege of nearly a year, both seized control of\nthe city and defeated a Turkish army that attempted to relieve it. The army then marched south\nto Jerusalem and into territory controlled by the Fatimid caliphate\u2014itself a Shi\u2019ite state that\nwas no friend of the Sunni Saljuq Turks. Venice and Genoa, meanwhile, transported supplies\nto the Crusaders by sea. The Crusaders rejected Fatimid overtures for a negotiated settlement\nand, in June of 1099, arrived outside the walls of Jerusalem. The Crusaders stormed the city\u2019s\nwalls, and, as the city fell, it was subject to a brutal sack, with both the city\u2019s defenders and its\ncivilian population subject to a bloody slaughter. We must note that there was nothing partic-\nularly unique about this massacre. The custom among most pre-modern peoples was that if a\ncity resisted an attacking army, then it would be subject to sack and massacre of its population\nwere it to fall.\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem, the Crusaders established four states in the Levant: the County\nof Edessa, in northern Mesopotamia, the Principality of Antioch, centered on the city of Antioch\nPage | 446 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nand its environs; the County of Tripoli, in what is roughly Lebanon today; and the Kingdom of\nJerusalem, which occupied Palestine and whose capital was the city of Jerusalem. These states\nwere ruled by men (and often women) who were Catholic in religion and ethnically Western\nEuropean. The religion and institutions of these Crusader States were nearly the same as those\nof Western Europe.\nThese states attracted some settlers, in both their warrior aristocracy and even merchants and\npeasants. But many of the subjects of the Christian rulers of these kingdoms were Muslims (or\nChristian Arabs, who had special privileges over their Muslim counterparts, but fewer rights than\nCatholic, ethnically Western European Christians). Indeed, the Crusader States would consis-\ntently suffer from a lack of manpower: although the pope had spoken of rich lands for the taking\nin Palestine, most of the knights who had gone on the First Crusade (and survived) returned to\nWestern Europe. The Crusader States relied on extensive networks of heavily fortified stone castles\nfor defense. They were fortunate that the Middle East was politically fragmented and Fatimid\nEgypt was weak. Whether these states would be sustainable in the face of stronger Muslim powers\nremained to be seen.\n12.13 THE TWELFTH CENTURY IN WESTERN EUROPE\nIn the twelfth century, many of Europe\u2019s kingdoms saw a gradual centralization of state\npower. England had long been Western Europe\u2019s most centralized state. In 1066, a group of\nNormans under their Duke, William the Bastard, invaded England. William defeated the English\narmy, making himself the king\nof England: he was thus known\nas William the Conqueror.\nThis conquest of England by\nFrench-speakers moved the\nculture, language, and institu-\ntions of England closer to those\nof France. Although England\nlooked more feudal, it never-\ntheless retained a centralized\nbureaucratic apparatus. William\nwas able to use this bureaucracy\nto conduct a nationwide census,\na feat of which no European\nstate outside of the Byzantine\nEmpire was capable. Although\nEngland would suffer a civil war\nFigure 12.11 | King Henry II and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine of nearly a decade and a half in\nAuthor: Anonymous the twelfth century, for the most\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\npart, its monarchs, particularly\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 447 Henry I (r. 1100 \u2013 1135) and Henry\nII (r. 1154 \u2013 1189), were innovative\nand clever administrators, creating\na network of royal courts and a\nsophisticated office of tax collec-\ntion known as the Exchequer.\nFrance had entered the tenth and\neleventh centuries as the most loose-\nly-governed kingdom of Europe. In\n987, France\u2019s nobles elected Hugh\nCapet, the count of Paris, as king,\neffectively replacing the Carolingian\ndynasty. The Capetian Dynasty\u2019s\nkings, however, directly controlled\nonly the lands around Paris. In\nFigure 12.12 | Dover castle, built by King Henry II\naddition, after the Norman conquest\nAuthor: Jake Keup\nSource: Wikimedia Commons of England in 1066, the Norman\nLicense: CC BY 2.0 kings of England were also dukes of\nlarge French territories. Thus, for the\nfirst part of the twelfth century, much of France was under the effective control of the English crown.\nIn spite of these challenges, the Capetian monarchs gradually built their kingdom into a functional\nstate. They cultivated a reputa-\ntion as defenders of Christianity\nin order to gain legitimacy from\nthe Church. They also sought to\nenforce the feudal obligations that\nthe powerful nobles owed to the\ncrown, often calling on them to\nserve militarily so as to create a\nhabit of obedience to the king.\nTo the southwest, the rise of\nthe Muslim Almoravid Empire\nunder the rule of aggressively\nexpansionist Muslim religious\nreformers in North Africa briefly\nput the Reconquista in jeopardy,\nbut, by the early twelfth century,\nit had resumed, with the Muslim\nstronghold of Zaragoza falling to Map 12.4 | Spain, progress of the Reconquista\nAuthor: William R. Shepherd\nChristian armies in 1118. After\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthe First Crusade, those knights License: Public Domain\nPage | 448 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nwho traveled to Spain to help its Christian kings fight Muslims received the same forgiveness\nof sins that the papacy granted to crusaders in the Levant. Over the twelfth century, four major\nChristian kingdoms would emerge in the Iberian Peninsula: Portugal, Leon-Castile, Navarre,\nand Aragon. These kingdoms would develop a sophisticated system of taxation in order to fund\nthe Reconquista. In the later twelfth century, they faced the challenge of the Almohad Empire\nthat emerged from the Islamic Maghreb to unite Muslim Spain and North Africa. By the 1150s,\nChristian Spain was on the defensive once again.\nIn Scandinavia, too, a set of strong monarchies had emerged in Denmark and Norway by the\nend of the twelfth century.\n12.14 EMPIRES: RECOVERY AND COLLAPSE\n12.14.1 Frederick Barbarossa and the Holy Roman Empire\nThe Investiture Controversy had weakened the power of the Holy Roman Emperors. In the\nearly part of the twelfth century, power in the Holy Roman Empire decentralized in the same way\nthat it had in tenth- and eleventh-century France, while the cities of northern Italy were increas-\ningly governing themselves with little direct authority exercised by the Holy Roman Emperors.\nThe Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (r. 1152 \u2013 1190) sought to arrest this decline and\nmake his subjects adhere to his authority.\nFrederick\u2019s two overriding goals were to ensure that the great princes of Central Europe and\nthe city-states of Northern Italy acknowledged and submitted to his authority. Northern Italy\nwas a particularly vexing challenge. By the middle of the twelfth century, many of the cities of\nnorthern Italy had gradually moved from rule by an urban nobility or bishops to self-govern-\nment by an elected commune, and these communes were often reluctant to acknowledge imperial\nauthority, especially with respect to the taxes that Barbarossa believed were owed him. Shortly\nafter beginning his reign, Barbarossa sought to implement this authority.\nBarbarossa had a great deal of initial success, but eventually the city-states of Northern Italy\nunited into an organization called the Lombard League, and this League allied with the popes,\nwho lent their moral authority to the cause of the northern Italian city-states. Indeed, part of the\ndifficulties faced by Barbarossa was that any pope would be more likely to try to keep northern and\ncentral Italy as far from direct control of the Holy Roman Emperors as possible. If the emperors\nwere too powerful in Northern and Central Italy, then they would threaten the papacy\u2019s indepen-\ndence, jeopardizing everything the eleventh-century reforming popes had struggled to accom-\nplish. Eventually, this coalition of the papacy and Lombard League inflicted a military defeat on\nBarbarossa at the 1176 Battle of Legnano, after which Barbarossa was forced to concede a great\ndeal of self-rule within the Empire to the Italian city-states.\nNear the end of his reign, Barbarossa would lead an immense army on a crusade. In 1187,\nthe kings of Western Europe found themselves forced to respond to a great catastrophe for\nChristendom: the city, and, indeed, most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem had fallen to a Muslim\narmy under the sultan Saladin. These kings responded with the effort known as the Third Crusade.\nPage | 449 12.14.2 The Komnenoi in Byzantium\nThe other empire claiming (with somewhat\nmore justice) to be the rightful heir of the Roman\nEmpire was the Byzantine Empire, and, after the\ndisaster of Manzikert, the Komnenos emperors\nhad managed to rebuild a Byzantine army based\non the system of pronoiai and mercenary forces.\nEmperor John II (r. 1118 \u2013 1143) followed up on\nAlexios\u2019s work and established effective Byzantine\ncontrol over much of Western Anatolia, consoli-\ndated imperial hold on Southeastern Europe, and,\nindeed, forced the Crusader States to acknowledge\nhim as their overlord.\nMap 12.5 | The Eastern Mediterranean in the\nreign of John II\nAuthor: Alexander G. Findlay\nSource: Classical Atlas of Ancient Geography\nLicense: Public Domain\nAt the same time that Barbarossa sought\nto build the Holy Roman Empire as a credible\npower, in the east, Manuel Komnenos (r.\n1143 \u2013 1180) sought to do the same with\nhis Empire. He managed to suppress the\ngrowing power of Venice in the Eastern\nMediterranean, form an alliance with the\ngrowing kingdom of Hungary, and tempo-\nrarily force the Turks of central Anatolia to\nacknowledge his overlordship. In the end,\nFigure 12.13 | Manuel Komnenos and his wife,\nhowever, the emperor\u2019s reach exceeded his\nMaria of Antioch\nAuthor: Anonymous grasp. His attempt to conquer Fatimid Egypt\nSource: Wikimedia Commons in alliance with the Kingdom of Jerusalem\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 450 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nfailed when the military commander of Damascus, Saladin, outmaneuvered both Byzantium and\nJerusalem and instead added Egypt to the territory of Damascus, which created a Muslim Empire\nin the Middle East that menaced the Crusader States (see Chapter Eight). And the emperor\u2019s effort\nto return central Anatolia to Byzantine rule ultimately failed when his army was defeated by the\nSaljuq Sultanate of Rum at Myriokephalon in 1176. Ultimately, the Byzantine Empire\u2019s undoing\nwas not necessarily in individual battles, but rather in that the loss of the wealthy agricultural land\nof Central Anatolia to the Turks meant that its emperors never quite had the tax base necessary to\nput their ambitions of a restored Roman Empire into practice.\nIn the end, the Komnenoi had managed to restore the Byzantine Empire as a regional power,\nbut it was left with structural weaknesses that would eventually prove to be its undoing.\n12.15 THE TWELFTH-CENTURY RENAISSANCE\nThe twelfth century in Western Europe was a time of renewed vibrancy in intellectual activity,\nand much of this activity centered on Europe\u2019s towns and cities. We call this renewal of intellectual\nactivity the Twelfth-Century Renaissance in order to separate it from both the Carolingian\nRenaissance of the eighth and ninth centuries and the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth\nand fifteenth centuries. Both monasteries and cathedrals were centers of education in Western\nEurope, even during the dark days of the tenth century. Over the eleventh century, thinkers in the\nmonasteries of Western Europe had increasingly sought to apply the tools of logic (in particular\nAristotelian logic) to the study of the Bible. But Western Europeans were familiar with very little\nof Aristotle\u2019s work aside from a small number of logical writings that had been translated from\nGreek into Latin in the sixth century. The twelfth century would see a massive shift, with an\nimmense growth of interest in philosophy on the part of those men (and a few women) who had\na formal education. The spur to this interest would come from events in Southwestern Europe.\nAl-Andalus had been a major source of Muslim intellectual activity. As early as the tenth\ncentury, Christian scholars, such as Gerbert of Aurillac (who eventually became Pope Sylvester II2,\nr. 999 \u2013 1003), had visited Muslim-ruled Spain to read the works of ancient Greek thinkers that\nwere unavailable elsewhere in Western Europe. Gerbert\u2019s writings show him to be particularly\nfascinated with Euclid, Arabic numerals, and the concept of zero.\nWhen Toledo fell to Christian armies in 1085, its libraries became available to the larger\nChristian world. Muslims had translated most of the philosophy of Aristotle into Arabic in\naddition to writing extensive original works that engaged with the thought of Aristotle and Plato.\nOnce these books were in Christian hands, Raymond, archbishop of Toledo (r. 1125 \u2013 1152), set\nup translation teams. People who spoke Arabic and the Romance languages of Spain would first\ntranslate these books into Spanish, and these books would then be translated into Latin, which\nwould thus make Aristotle and Ptolemy (as well as the works of Arabic philosophers) available\nto educated people throughout Western Europe. The availability of texts that had been largely\nknown only by reputation to the thinkers of Western Europe spurred an intellectual revolution,\n2 Between the sixth and eleventh centuries, a practice emerged whereby the pope would adopt a distinct name from the\nname he was born with upon ascension to the papacy. The practice continues to the present day.\nPage | 451 as the Christian thinkers sought\nto understand how to reconcile an\nunderstanding of the world based\non Christianity with the approach of\nthe non-Christian ancient Greeks.\nSuch translations on the\nChristian/Muslim frontier continued\nthrough the twelfth and thirteenth\ncenturies. Christendom thus had\naccess to the writings of Muslim\nphilosophers. Western Europeans\nread natural philosophy, such as\nal-Haytham\u2019s writings on optics and\nthe Aristotelian commentaries of Ibn\nRushd (whose name they pronounced\nas Averro\u00ebs). This movement saw the\ntranslation not only of philosophy,\nbut also of medicine\u2014indeed, in the\nMuslim world, philosophers often\nserved as physicians\u2014so the medical\nworks of philosophers and physi-\ncians such as Ibn Sina (whose name\nWestern Europeans pronounced\nas Avicenna) were read avidly by\nChristians in Western Europe.\nPhilosophy and medicine were\nFigure 12.14 | Latin Manuscript of Aristotle\u2019s Physics\nnot the only fields of study to receive\nAuthor: Jean-Christophe Benoist\nSource: Wikimedia Commons new interest. Western Europeans\nLicense: Public Domain were also showing a renewed interest\nin law. Although the kingdoms that\nhad grown up in Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire had incorporated\nsome elements of Roman Law as well as the oral law of the Germanic peoples into their legal\nsystems, law codes were for the most part unsystematic. Starting from the eleventh century,\nscholars, particularly those based in the schools of Bologna, began subjecting The Justinian Code\n(see Chapter Seven) to intense study, using logical analysis to create a body of systematic writing\non the interpretation of law. These men who studied Roman Law would often go to work for\nkings and emperors, with the result that much European law would often draw its inspiration\nfrom Justinian.\nMost schools were still attached to cathedral churches\u2014indeed, these schools in which\nmedicine, law, and philosophy flourished as disciplines of study might be compared to the\nmadrassas of the Muslim world\u2014so the chief field of study in these schools was theology, that is,\nPage | 452 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nthe interpretation of the Bible. And theologians increasingly drew on logical analysis and philos-\nophy of language to understand what they believed was God\u2019s revelation to humanity.\nEventually, many of these cathedral schools gained the right to organize as self-governing\ninstitutions. We call these institutions universities. By the end of the twelfth century, the univer-\nsities of Bologna, Paris, and Oxford had become self-governing institutions and would serve as the\nfoundation of the university system of the Western world that exists to the present day.\n12.16 THE THIRD CRUSADE\nThe Crusader States had endured from 1099 to 1187 because the Muslim Middle East was politically\nfragmented. Once Saladin had overthrown Egypt\u2019s Fatimid Caliphate and united Egypt to Muslim-\ncontrolled Syria and northern Iraq (see Chapter Eight), he was able to turn his resources to destroying\nMap 12.6 | Europe and the Mediterranean in the Third Crusade\nAuthor: User \u201cRoke\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 453 the Crusader States. Eventually, at the 1187 Battle of Hattin, his forces met the combined forces of the\nKingdom of Jerusalem. The result was a complete victory for Saladin. With the manpower of most of\nthe Kingdom of Jerusalem killed or captured\u2014knights and noble prisoners would be held for a hefty\nransom, while lower-ranked soldiers would go to slave markets\u2014he was easily able to capture most of\nthe castles and cities that made up the kingdom, to include the city of Jerusalem itself.\nThe result shocked the Christian world, and Pope Gregory VIII quickly issued the bull (that is,\nan official papal pronouncement) Audita tremendi, which called on the Christian world to retake\nJerusalem. The kings of England and France, Richard I (known as Lionheart, r. 1189 \u2013 1199) and\nPhilip Augustus (r. 1180 \u2013 1223), respectively, took vows to launch a crusade, as did Holy Roman\nEmperor Frederick Barbarossa. (As usual, the Christians of Iberia took little part in crusades in\nthe Levant, as their efforts focused on the Reconquista.)\nAlthough Frederick Barbarossa died en route (he drowned in a stream in the mountains of\nAnatolia), both Richard I and Philip Augustus eventually arrived in the Levant by sea. Although\nPhilip soon returned to France, King Richard battled Saladin over the course of two years, to\nresults that were mostly inconclusive. The crusading army seized most of the castles and cities\non the coast, and these became the center for a restored, but smaller Kingdom of Jerusalem, but\nthe Crusaders ultimately failed to take Jerusalem itself. The Crusade finally ended in a truce in\nwhich both parties ratified this state of affairs, with Christian pilgrims allowed to visit the city of\nJerusalem, even though it remained under Muslim rule.\n12.17 THE FOURTH CRUSADE\nWhile Jerusalem remained under Muslim control, the papacy\u2019s goal was to retake it, especially\nas, in 1198, the man elected pope was one of the most ambitious men to wear the papal crown\nof the Middle Ages: Pope Innocent III (r. 1198 \u2013 1216). Innocent\u2019s goals were to morally reform\nsociety and to launch a crusade for retaking the holy city of Jerusalem. In the year of his election,\nhe issued a call to crusade that ended up as a disaster.\nBetween 1185 and 1204, the Byzantine Empire had drastically weakened. After the death\nof Manuel Komnenos with his heir still a child, the Empire faced a string of catastrophes. The\nchild-emperor was murdered, his successor was eventually overthrown, and the next emperor\nafter that was likewise overthrown. During this political infighting, the Empire\u2019s peripheral terri-\ntories of Serbia, Cyprus, and Cilicia all seceded. Closer to the center, the Bulgars rose in rebellion in\n1186 and re-established an independent Bulgaria within only a few days\u2019 march of Constantinople\nitself. In addition, the chain of emperors, regents, and usurpers reigning between 1185 and 1204\nhad allowed the Byzantine navy to gradually disintegrate.\nIn 1202, a group of crusaders (with kings notably absent) contracted with the government of\nVenice to transport them to fight in Egypt, now ruled by Saladin\u2019s heirs. When these crusaders proved\nunable to pay, the Venetian government requested their military assistance. The son of the deposed\nemperor (whose eyes had been gouged out) approached the crusaders and Venetians. He offered the\ncrusaders military and financial assistance and for Venice to gain trading privileges in the Empire if\ncrusaders and Venetians would help him regain his throne. The end result was that, in 1204, after a\nPage | 454 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nseries of misadventures, a crusader army stormed the walls of Constantinople and put the city to a\nbrutal sack; then, the crusaders parceled out much of the territory of the Byzantine Empire amongst\nthemselves. The most advantageous ports went to Venice, which would use them as the basis of a\nMediterranean trading empire that would endure for centuries. The Crusades, which had begun as a\nresult of an appeal for help by the Byzantine Empire, ultimately resulted in its destruction.\nAlthough the Byzantine Empire had been broken up, three states survived that claimed to be\nlegitimate heirs to the Byzantine State. One was established in Western Anatolia with its capital\nin Nicaea, another, in Epirus, in what is today the country of Albania, while the third was based\non the city of Trebizond, on the northern coast of Anatolia. The Nicene Empire would eventually\nretake Constantinople in 1261, although the restored state would never be the regional power that\nthe Empire had been under the Komnenoi.\nMap 12.7 | The Latin Empire in 1212 CE | The Latin Empire of Constantinople (the state established by crusaders\nafter 1204) and Byzantine successor states\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov.

In 1240, the Mongols shattered\nthe Kievan Rus, destroyed the city of Kiev, and left the plains around the city littered with dead\nbodies stretching out to the horizon. The Ruses would remain Mongol vassals for the rest of the\nMiddle Ages. The Mongol advance continued. In 1241, at the Battle of Mohi, a Hungarian army\nwas annihilated, and the Mongols subsequently slew half the kingdom\u2019s population before Batu\nKhan, the Mongol commander, returned to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan (see\nChapter Eleven).\nMap 12.8 | Europe in 1240 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov.

The Empire would, however, be fatally under-\nmined by the struggles between Emperor Frederick II (r. 1215 \u2013 1250) and a series of mostly forceful\nand able popes. The dispute was the same as that which had occupied his grandfather, Frederick\nBarbarossa. Unlike Barbarossa, the base of Frederick II\u2019s power was in Sicily, for his father, Henry\nVI (r. 1190 \u2013 1197), had married Constance, queen of Sicily, thus making Frederick II ruler of\nboth the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily. Like his grandfather, he sought to create\nan empire that ruled both Italy and central Europe. And for the same reason that the popes had\nopposed Barbarossa, they, together with the cities of northern Italy, opposed Frederick II. In the\nend, when Frederick died, the Holy Roman Empire collapsed as a unitary state. For nearly twenty\nyears, it had no emperor, as the papacy\u2019s allies hunted down and brutally slaughtered Frederick\u2019s\nheirs, and then, by the time an emperor was elected from the Austrian nobles of the Hapsburg\nfamily in 1273, the Empire was more a loose collection of states than a centralized empire.\n12.18.3 Expansion of Christendom on the Frontiers\nTo the northeast, Christendom continued to expand. In the forests and bogs around the Baltic\nSea, German-speaking crusaders (as well as Danes) conquered the heathen3 peoples, converting\nthem to Christianity and settling the territory with Germans and Danes. These efforts were recog-\nnized by the popes as crusades. By the end of the thirteenth century, all of Europe except for\nLithuania was Christian. The kingdom of Lithuania would remain resolutely heathen and mili-\ntarily resist German Crusaders until 1385, at which time the Lithuanian kings finally converted to\nChristianity when their kingdom was combined with Poland.\nIn thirteenth-century Spain, the most significant accomplishment of the Christian monarchs\nwas that, on 16 July 1212, at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, the combined armies of Castile,\nAragon, Portugal, and Navarre met those of the Almohad Caliphate and won a victory so crushing\nthat the power of the Almohads was forever broken. In the decades that followed, Aragon, Portugal,\nand Castile conquered all of Muslim Iberia, save for Granada.\n12.18.4 France and England\nPerhaps the most successful thirteenth-century monarchs were the Capetian kings of France.\nIn the years between 1203 and 1214, King Philip Augustus managed to dispossess the English king\nof almost all of his territory held in France. He was also increasingly successful in using a set of\nrecognized laws to enhance his legitimacy. So he made sure that he had a strong legal case drawn\nup by expert lawyers before he dispossessed England\u2019s King John. Likewise, he created a royal\ncourt that was a court of final appeal\u2014and that meant that, even in parts of the kingdom where\ngreat lords exercised their own justice, the king had increasing authority. In 1208, Pope Innocent\nIII had called a crusade against the semi-independent territories of southern France because of\n3 Generally, we refer to the followers of the Greco-Roman religion that prevailed before Christianity as pagans and the\nfollowers of the northern European religion that prevailed before Christianity as heathens.\nPage | 457 the presence there of a group of heretics known as the\nCathars. In the resulting crusade (called the Albigensian\nCrusade because much of the fighting happened around\nthe town of Albi), crusaders from the north crushed the\npower of the great nobles of southern France. King Louis\nVIII (r. 1223 \u2013 1226) then extended the direct rule of the\nFrench crown into areas where, for centuries, the French\nkings had ruled only indirectly.\nFrance\u2019s King Louis IX (r. 1226 \u2013 1270) was perhaps its\nmost effective Capetian king. He continued the process of\nestablishing the royal courts as supreme in the kingdom.\nIt was in Louis IX\u2019s reign that we can see the beginnings\nof a sophisticated and accurate royal budget.\nWhen England\u2019s King John (r. 1199 \u2013 1216) lost to\nPhilip Augustus, his outraged nobles rebelled, resulting\nin a civil war from 1215 to 1217. One temporary treaty of\nthis civil war, a treaty known as Magna Carta (signed\nin 1215), would have a much further-reaching impact\nthan anyone who had drafted it could have foreseen. One Figure 12.15 | A Knight in Thirteenth-\nparticular provision of Magna Carta was that if the king Century Armor\nAuthor: British Library\nwanted to raise new taxes on the people of England, then\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nhe needed to get the consent of the community of the realm License: Public Domain\nby convening a council. The convening of such councils,\nknown as parliaments, would\ncome to be systematized over the\ncourse of the thirteenth century,\nuntil, by the reign of Edward I (r.\n1272 \u2013 1307), they would have\nrepresentatives from most regions\nof England and would vote on\nwhether to grant taxes to the king.\nParliaments were not unique to\nEngland, however. Most Spanish\nkings would consult with a body\nknown as a cortes, with represen-\ntatives of both Spain\u2019s towns and\nnobility, and the Scandinavian\nkings had assemblies called\nFigure 12.16 | France\u2019s King Louis IX\nthings. Indeed, by 1356, the Holy\nAuthor: Guillaume de Saint-Pathus\nSource: Wikimedia Commons Roman Emperor would be elected\nLicense: Public Domain by an assembly of the Holy Roman\nPage | 458 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nEmpire\u2019s greatest nobles, known as electors. England\u2019s parliaments, however, would gradually\nevolve from assemblies convoked when a king wanted to raise taxes to a regular assembly that\ngave representative voice to the people of England.\nAs stated earlier, of thirteenth-century Europe\u2019s monarchs, France\u2019s Capetian kings were\nsome of the most successful. Indeed, King Louis IX\u2019s French state was well-administered enough\nthat he was able to manage the logistics of a military campaign fought at the opposite end of the\nMediterranean: the war that modern historians often call the Seventh Crusade.\n12.19 LATER CRUSADES AND CRUSADING\u2019S ULTIMATE FAILURE\nAfter the Third Crusade, the re-established Crusader States managed to survive and even\nexpand in power for the next several decades. Syria and Egypt were split between Saladin\u2019s heirs,\nand the crusader kingdoms often enjoyed good relations with Ayyubid Egypt: indeed, a truce\nworked out between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and the Egyptian sultan al-Kamil in 1229\nresulted in the city of Jerusalem itself returning to Christian rule.\nMap 12.9 | The Crusader States in 1243 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nPage | 459 In the 1240s, however, forces far from the Levant brought down the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nAs the Mongols gradually conquered Central Asia (see Chapter Eleven), the Khwarazmian Turks\nwere driven from their realm in the steppes into Syria and northern Iraq. They ended up allying\nwith Ayyubid Egypt against the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and, in 1244, the combined\narmies of Damascus and Jerusalem were defeated by an Egyptian/Khwarazmian army. Jerusalem\nfell under Muslim rule, under which it would remain until 1917.\nIn response to the fall of Jerusalem, Pope Innocent IV (r. 1243 \u2013 1254) called a crusade that\nwould be led by King Louis IX. While it had contingents from other Western European kingdoms,\nthis effort was primarily an effort of the French crown. Although King Louis IX was able to manage\nthe impressive logistical feat of organizing and equipping an army that seized the northern\nEgyptian port of Damietta, the effort to take all of Egypt was ultimately unsuccessful. Over the\ncourse of 1250, the French army was surrounded in the swamps of the Nile Delta outside of Cairo\nand forced to surrender, with Louis himself captured. The only lasting result in the Middle East\nwas that, during the fighting, the Ayyubid sultan\u2019s Mamluks launched a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and seized\npower in Egypt, thereby creating in Egypt a military power that would dominate the Levant for\nnearly three centuries (see Chapter Eight).\nIndeed, in the four decades after Louis\u2019s failure in the Nile Delta, the Mamluk sultans of Egypt\nwould eventually conquer all of the Crusader States, with the last crusader stronghold in the Levant,\nthe city of Acre, falling in 1291. Although Popes would still call crusades for military efforts against\nMuslim forces (and indeed, still make calls to retake the city of Jerusalem), crusading had failed.\nOne reason for crusading\u2019s ultimate failure was that, as Western European kings consolidated\ntheir power, they often had priorities other than crusading. England\u2019s Edward I, for example,\nspent a few months fighting in the Levant in 1271; however, he spent most of his reign fighting to\nsubdue England\u2019s neighboring kingdoms of Wales and Scotland.\nIn the end, the Crusades failed, and their greatest long-term impacts were the destruction\nof the Byzantine Empire and the growth of the sea power of Genoa and Venice, whose ships and\nsailors had transported people and supplies between Europe and the Crusader States.\n12.20 SCHOLASTICISM\nAs more and more works of ancient Greek and Muslim philosophy became available to Western\nEuropean Christians, the question of how to understand the world acquired more urgency. The\nphilosophers of the ancient Greek and Muslim worlds were known to have produced much\nuseful knowledge. But they had not been Christians. How, asked many thinkers, were Christians\nto understand the world: through divine revelation, as it appeared in the Bible, or through the\nhuman reason of philosophers? Indeed, this question was reminiscent of similar questions taking\nplace in the Islamic world, when thinkers such as al-Ghazali questioned how useful the tools of\nlogic and philosophy were in understanding the Quran (see Chapter Eight).\nThis controversy had raged since at least the twelfth century, when certain devout monks had\nsaid, \u201cWhoever seeks to make Aristotle a Christian makes himself a heretic.\u201d Out of this controversy,\nmedieval Europe produced its greatest thinker, St. Thomas Aquinas (1224 \u2013 1274). St. Thomas was\nPage | 460 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\na Dominican friar. Friars were those\nchurchmen who, like monks, took vows of\nchastity, poverty, and obedience. Instead\nof living in isolated monasteries, though,\nfriars spent much of their time preaching\nto laypeople in Europe\u2019s growing towns\nand cities. These friars, whose two\nmajor groups were the Franciscans and\nDominicans, had schools in most major\nuniversities of Western Europe by the\nearly thirteenth century. Aquinas, a\nphilosopher in the Dominican school\nof the University of Paris, had argued\nthat human reason and divine revela-\ntion were in perfect harmony. He did so\nbased on the techniques of the disputed\nquestion. He would raise a point, raise its\nobjection, then provide an answer, and\nthis answer would always be based on a\nlogical argument. Aquinas was only part Figure 12.17 | St. Thomas Aquinas | Note that the artist\nof a larger movement in the universities shows him defeating the non-Christian Aristotelian philosophy\nof Ibn Rushd.\nof Western Europe. We generally call\nAuthor: Benozzo Gozzoli\nthe movement to reconcile Christian Source: Wikimedia Commons\ntheology with human reason through the License: Public Domain\nuse of logic scholasticism.\nAquinas and the scholastics can be compared to Zhu Xi and the neo-Confucians of Song China.\nJust as Zhu Xi had sought to integrate Confucian thought with Buddhist and Daoist philosophy,\nso also Aquinas sought to integrate both Aristotelian logic and Christian theology.\nThe period not only saw successes in the field of speculative philosophy and theology, but also\nin the practical application of science. The master masons who designed Western Europe\u2019s castles\nand cathedral churches built hundreds of soaring cathedrals that would be the tallest buildings in\nEurope until the nineteenth century. We call these cathedrals\u2019 architecture Gothic. Gothic cathe-\ndrals were well known for their use of pointed arches (which may have been copied from Middle\nEastern styles) that allowed taller buildings and for stained-glass windows that admitted a dazzling\narray of light. These cathedrals were in many ways made possible by the prosperity of Europe\u2019s\ntowns, whose governing councils often financed the construction of these magnificent churches.\nThirteenth-century Europe showed other developments in technology as well. In 1269, Pierre\nof Harincourt first came to understand the principles of magnetic poles based on an analysis of the\nmagnetic compass (in use since the twelfth century). At the same time, between 1286 and 1306,\nbased on the pre-existing technology of lens-grinding (much of which had come from the Muslim\nworld), Western Europeans invented eyeglasses. Water clocks had been known throughout the\nPage | 461 world since ancient times, but, in the years between 1271 and 1300, Western Europeans invented\nthe mechanical clock.\nIn the twelfth, thirteenth, and four-\nteenth centuries, Western Europeans\ngradually adapted the art of alchemy,\nthe art of changing (or attempting to\nchange) one element into another, from\nthe Muslim world. Eventually, alche-\nmists (and natural philosophers who\nstudied alchemy) would find new tech-\nniques of refining and compounding\nchemicals, although their ultimate goal,\nthe ability to turn base metals into gold,\nwould never succeed.\nIn addition to these technologies\ninvented or improved in medieval\nEurope, the Mongol Empire\u2019s opening\nof trade routes had allowed the impor-\ntation of East Asian technologies such\nas gunpowder.\nFigure 12.18 | Lincoln Cathedral in England, built in the\nGothic style in the thirteenth century | Note the pointed\narches and the stained glass.

They often lived in villages in one- or\ntwo-room houses with separate space for livestock. Only the richest of peasants\u2014and some free\npeasants did prosper\u2014could afford a bed. Most people slept in straw. The most furniture in a\npeasant household might be a table and stool. The peasant diet was mainly grain, both bread and\nporridge, and peasants got their protein from both legumes and eggs. The occasional meat came\nfrom chickens, those sheep that were too old for shearing, and sometimes pigs. Beef was reserved\nfor nobles.\nFigure 12.20 | Peasants Keeping Pigs\nAuthor: User \u201cPannage\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nNobles often lived in large rural houses. They were sometimes attached to castles, but many\ncastles were unoccupied in times of peace. The noble diet was heavy in meat; indeed, nobles often\nsuffered from gout, a painful swelling of the joints from too much meat in the diet. Meat dishes\nwere lavishly cooked in spices, like cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, pepper, and saffron (chilies\nwere unknown in the Eastern Hemisphere in pre-modern times).\nPeasant recreation might include ball games, wrestling, and, of course, drinking. Beer was\nnorthern Europe\u2019s commonest drink, while, in southern Europe, people drank wine. The best\nquality wines were a luxury, with nobles throughout Europe drinking the wines of Italy and\nsouthern France.\nPage | 463 Noble recreation included chess (intro-\nduced from the Muslim world around\nthe eleventh century), hunting (usually\nforbidden to peasants), and the tourna-\nment, in which knights would form into\nteams and fight each other, sometimes\nwith blunted weapons, but sometimes with\nregular weapons, relying on their armor to\nprotect them. Accidental fatalities in hunting\nand tournaments were common.\nEurope\u2019s growing cities had narrow,\nunpaved streets with pools of waste,\nthrough which pigs, dogs, and other\nanimals would wander. Paris, whose\nstreets King Philip Augustus had ordered\npaved and lined with ditches to carry away\nwaste water, was the exception rather than\nthe rule. Likewise, although London had\na network of pipes to carry water from\nsprings by 1236, the inhabitants of most\ncities got water from wells, and these were\noften contaminated. Indeed, the disease\nfrom parasites and contaminated water Figure 12.21 | Thirteenth-Century Knights Fighting\nin a Tournament\nmeant that cities were population sinks,\nAuthor: Unknown\nwith more people dying than were born. Source: Wikimedia Commons\nTheir population increased largely because License: Public Domain\nof people migrating from the countryside,\nsince by the twelfth century, most towns of Western Europe recognized a runaway serf as legally\nfree if he or she had resided within the walls of a town for a year and a day.\nMedieval Europe remained a patriarchal culture. The division of labor in peasant, middle-\nclass, and noble households, however, meant that women played an active part in economic life.\nWomen peasants would often labor alongside men in the fields, and women often ran taverns.\nLikewise, among nobles, women usually managed the household and might direct the economic\nactivity of the great agricultural estates.\nBut women remained subordinate. Although they could be nuns, women could not be\nordained as clergy. Legally, a woman was subordinate to her husband. And even though nobles\nincreasingly read love poetry that placed women in a position of honor and devotion (and this\npoetry may originally have been modeled on the Arabic love poetry common in al-Andalus),\nthis very devotion emphasized the woman as a prize to be sought after rather than as a partner.\nPage | 464 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\n12.22 FOURTEENTH CENTURY CRISES\nAs the thirteenth century drew to a close, Europe began to run into its Malthusian limits,\ni.e., how many people a land\u2019s resources can support before food starts to run short. At the same\ntime, the previously-warm climate began to cool, making conditions less suitable for agriculture.\nFamine returned to Europe.\nBetween 1315 and 1322, a set of extremely rainy, wet summers\u2014accounts written at the time\nspeak of castle walls being washed away in flood waters\u2014caused crops to fail, resulting in massive\nfamines and starvation. At the same time, livestock throughout western Europe died in droves\nfrom outbreaks of Rinderpest, Anthrax, and other diseases.\nMap 12.10 | Europe in 1350 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nPage | 465 Many peasants starved. Many more\nsuffered from malnutrition. Contemporary\naccounts refer to hungry peasants resorting\nto cannibalism. Like all other crops, cash\ncrops also failed, so that those who did\nsurvive were poorer.\nScarcely a generation had passed after\nthe Great Famine when Europe was hit by a\nglobal pandemic: the Black Death. The Black\nDeath was almost certainly an outbreak of\nBubonic Plague, caused by the bacterium\nYersina pestis. This disease has an extremely\nhigh mortality rate\u2014certain varieties can\nhave a mortality rate of over ninety-nine\npercent, and even the more survivable\nvarieties usually kill the majority of the\ninfected. The Plague acts in three ways: the\nvariety called Bubonic Plague results in\npainful, swollen lumps around the armpits,\ncrotch, and neck (locations associated\nwith the lymph nodes); when they burst, a\nfoul-smelling pus emerges. The septicemic\nvariety results in skin turning black and\ndying all over the body, and the pneumonic\nvariety\u2014almost always fatal\u2014shows no Figure 12.22 | Victims of the Black Death | Note that\nabove, we can see St. Sebastian in heaven praying to God on\nvisible symptoms, but affects the lungs, and\nbehalf of the Plague\u2019s victims.

Unfortunately for the License: CC0\nrest of the world, the trade routes opened by\nthe Mongols meant that not only could ideas and technology travel, but that disease could as well.\nThe Plague began in the East and Central Asia, but it quickly spread to the Middle East and North\nAfrica, to the Swahili Coast, and eventually to Western Europe.\nIts impacts were calamitous. A little over half of Europe\u2019s population died. After the first\noutbreak of the Plague, between 1347 and 1351, less virulent outbreaks continued to strike Europe\nnearly every year until 1782. Europe\u2019s population began a long decline; it did not start recovering\nuntil the fifteenth century. It did not return to its pre-Plague levels until the seventeenth (and in\nsome regions, the eighteenth) century. Casualty rates among clergy were as high as sixty percent,\nwith some monastic houses having casualty rates as high as ninety-nine percent, as monks living\nin communal environments were more likely to spread disease.\nPage | 466 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nIn the aftermath of the Plague, however, living conditions for those peasants who survived\nimproved in many ways. Because there were fewer people, those who survived had access to\nmore lands and resources. In addition, the need to find peasants to work the lands of the nobility\nmeant that nobles often offered better wages and living conditions to those who would settle on\ntheir lands. As a result, peasant wages rose and serfdom in Western Europe gradually vanished.\nAlthough in some kingdoms, monarchs and their assemblies attempted to create legislation to\nreinforce the social status of the peasantry, these efforts were often unsuccessful. This failure\nto maintain pre-existing status distinctions stood in contrast to Mamluk Egypt, where, in the\naftermath of the Plague, Egypt\u2019s ruling class of largely Turkic Mamluks managed to keep the\npeasantry in a firmly subordinate role and prevent the rise of peasant wages.\n12.23 WAR\nFamine and disease were not the only disasters to strike late medieval Europe. The four-\nteenth century also saw an increase in both civil wars and wars between states. The Holy Roman\nEmpire saw nearly a decade of civil war\n(1314 \u2013 1326) between rival emperors\nand, because of the close relations of\ntheir kings, Sweden, Denmark, and\nNorway experienced frequent combina-\ntions of civil and interstate war until the\n1397 Union of Kalmar brought the three\ntogether under one crown.\nThe longest-running of these wars\nwas between England and France, the\nso-called Hundred Years\u2019 War (1337 \u2013\n1453). In 1328, the French king Charles IV\ndied without a direct heir. England\u2019s king,\nEdward III (r. 1327 \u2013 1377), related to the\nFrench royal family, claimed to be rightful\nheir to the crown of France. The resulting\nwar would last over a century, although\nit was broken by frequent, lengthy truces.\nAlthough France had many more people\nthan England, the kingdom of England\nwas often able to defeat it. The main\nFigure 12.23 | England\u2019s King Edward III Surveying reason was that the English kings made\nthe Dead after the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy | Note that by the\nincreasing use of trained, disciplined\nfourteenth century, a knight\u2019s armor was a combination of\nchain mail and metal plates. infantry armies.

Using a combination of archers and infantry,\nthe English were able to inflict severe defeats on the French at both Cr\u00e9cy (26 August 1346) and\nPoitiers (19 September 1356).\nThe war was particularly hard on the civilians of the French countryside: the method of\nwaging war of a pre-modern army often involved invading enemy territory and burning crops,\nlooting villages, and murdering civilians. French peasants, who had suffered first from the Plague\nand then from war, rose in rebellion in 1358, but this rebellion was ruthlessly crushed, with the\npeasants slaughtered and leaders brutally executed.\nThe Hundred Years\u2019 War would spill over into Spain, which itself was suffering from a vicious\nwar between Castile and Aragon that eventually caused a Castilian civil war, with both French and\nEnglish intervening.\nThe wars of the fourteenth and especially fifteenth century saw not only an increasing use of\ntrained, professional armies, but also the employment of gunpowder weapons, invented in Song\nChina and first seen in Europe in the early 1300s. At first, firearms were limited to heavy, cumber-\nsome artillery pieces that were deployed from fixed points. Their use on the battlefield and in\nsieges was limited, although by the fifteenth century, cannons could blast open the gates of most\nexisting fortifications. By the mid-1400s, the harquebus, a man-transportable firearm, appeared\non the battlefield in Spain, bringing gunpowder to the individual infantryman.\n12.24 SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE IN THE LATE MIDDLE AGES\nMeanwhile, in Eastern Europe, the restored Byzantine Empire was unable to fully re-es-\ntablish itself even as a regional power in the Aegean. The warring Italian city-states of Genoa\nand Venice controlled many of the\nbest ports of the Aegean and Black\nSea, and a new Turkic power, that of\nthe Ottomans, was rising in Central\nAnatolia in the aftermath of the Mongol\ndestruction of the Saljuq sultanate.\nEmperor Andronikos II (r. 1282 \u2013 1328)\nhired a company of mercenaries from\nthe region of Spain called Catalonia, but\nthis Catalan Company, although it won\nsome victories against the Turks, even-\ntually turned on its employer and estab-\nlished a state in Athens that would last\nfor seventy years. With the failure of the\nCatalan Company to shore up Byzantine Figure 12.24 | Late Medieval Serbian Monastery\ndefenses in Anatolia, by 1331, nearly all Author: Petar Milosevic\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nByzantine territory in Asia Minor had\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 468 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nfallen under Turkish rule; shortly thereafter, the nascent Ottoman Empire began expanding\ninto southeastern Europe.\nThe disintegration of the Byzantine state did allow for the fourteenth-century flourishing of\nSerbian and Bulgarian Empires, whose cultures emerged as a melding of both Greek and Slavic\nelements to create a unique synthesis of cultures and institutions. In the end, though, these Empires\nwould eventually be overwhelmed by the Turks, with the Ottomans conquering Serbia between\n1389 and 1459 and Bulgaria in 1396. But even as the Byzantine state crumbled, intellectual activity\nflourished in the Orthodox Church. Greek intellectuals of the fourteenth century sought to engage\nwith the thought of Aquinas and experiment with new forms of prayer and meditation.\nIn the end, Ottoman power swept away all resistance, Bulgar, Serbian, and Byzantine, and in\n1453, the Turkish army conquered Constantinople. After two thousand years, the last remnant of\nthe Roman Empire was gone. In the meantime, though, the fall of the Byzantine Empire would\nalso be one factor eventually contributing to Europe\u2019s Renaissance.\n12.25 THE LATE MEDIEVAL PAPACY\nIn 1250, the papacy looked like it was at its high point. After nearly two centuries of struggle,\nthe popes had definitively broken the power of the Holy Roman Empire. Within less than a century,\nhowever, the power and prestige of the papacy would be heavily damaged.\nThe first major blow came when Pope Boniface VIII (r. 1294 \u2013 1303) clashed with King Philip\nIV (r. 1285 \u2013 1314) of France. When King Philip attempted to tax French clergy, Pope Boniface\nresisted strongly, claiming not only that a king had no right to tax any clergy, but also that all\nearthly authority was subor-\ndinate to the authority of the\npopes, who were rightful lords\nof the earth. This conflict ended\nwhen King Philip had a gang of\nmercenaries kidnap and abuse\nthe pope. Even though Boniface\nhimself escaped, he died of the\nshock shortly thereafter.\nIn order to avoid further\nantagonizing the French\ncrown, the College of Cardinals\n(those churchmen in Rome\nwho elect the pope) elected\nClement V (r. 1305 \u2013 1314), a\nFrenchman, to succeed him.\nClement, however, never took Figure 12.25 | The Kidnapping of Pope Boniface VIII\nup residence in Rome. In 1309, Author: Giovanni Villani\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nhe settled the papal court in\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 469 Avignon, a city owned by the papacy which sat just across the border of the Kingdom of France.\nTo many observers at the time, it looked as though the papacy had been relocated to France under\nthe thumb of the French monarchy.\nThe Italian poet Petrarch referred to the period when the papacy resided at Avignon as the\nBabylonian Captivity of the Church. He was referring metaphorically to the account in the\nOld Testament (also referred to as the Hebrew Bible) in which the people of Judaea had been\nheld captive in the city of Babylon. Petrarch was insinuating that God\u2019s community was now held\ncaptive in a foreign land rather than occupying Rome, the city of St. Peter and thirteen subsequent\ncenturies of popes.\nFigure 12.26 | The Papal Palace at Avignon\nAuthor: Jean-Marc Rosier\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Jean-Marc Rosier. Used with permission.\nThe crisis would only grow worse. In 1377, Pope Gregory XI (r. 1370 \u2013 1378) moved the papal\ncourt back to Rome. At his death, the cardinals, pressured by an angry Roman mob, elected Urban\nVI, an Italian. Urban, however, soon proved to be erratic and abusive, so many cardinals fled\nRome to Avignon, where they elected another pope. The result was that the Catholic Christian\nworld now had two popes, each one claiming to be the rightful representative of Jesus Christ\non earth. This period, lasting from 1378 to 1417, is known as the Great Schism; it resulted in\na divided church, with different bishops following different popes. A 1409 council convened to\nPage | 470 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\ndepose both popes and appoint a single pope instead resulted in three popes, as neither Rome nor\nthe Avignon papacy recognized this new pope.\nIn the end, although the conflict was resolved with the Council of Constance (1415 \u2013 1417)\ndeposing all three popes and selecting a new one, the prestige of the papacy had been tarnished.\nThe popes spent much of the later fifteenth century attempting to rebuild the Church\u2019s authority\nand prestige, although whether they would fully succeed remained to be seen.\n12.26 THE EUROPEAN RENAISSANCE\nNo intellectual movement can be traced to a single cause. An idea has many parents and even\nmore children. But if we look to the Mediterranean world of the fourteenth century, we can find\nat least a few causes of an intellectual and cultural movement historians generally call the Italian\nRenaissance. Renaissance comes from the French word for rebirth. It was an intellectual movement\nwhose ideals were to return to the art, literature, and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome.\nNorthern Italy was well-suited to allow for\nthe emergence of the Renaissance. Thanks to\nMediterranean trade, it was one of the wealth-\niest and most urbanized regions of Western\nEurope. It was also politically fragmented so\nthat the princes of its many courts all offered\nsponsorship to artists and intellectuals.\nMoreover Italy\u2019s education system had focused\nmore on the literature of Ancient Rome than\nthe rest of Europe, whose scholastic curric-\nulum often focused on logic and philosophy.\nIn this environment, the Italian poet\nFrancesco Petrarch\u2019s (1307 \u2013 1374) writings\nprompted a greater interest in the literature\nof Ancient Rome. This focus on studying liter-\nature rather than philosophy and theology is\noften known as humanism, since poetry\nand literature were called humanistic studies\nin medieval schools. Another key element\nof the humanistic movement was that its\nproponents believed in studying the ancient\ntexts themselves rather than the centuries\nof commentaries that had grown up around\nthese texts. These values of returning to the\nFigure 12.27 | Manuel Chrysoloras original texts shorn of their commentaries\nAuthor: Paolo Uccellp also led to an increase in the study of how the\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nwriters of ancient Rome had used the Latin\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 471 language and even of how Latin style\nhad altered during different times in the\nRoman Empire\u2019s history.\nOriginally, humanistic scholars had\nfocused on the study of Latin. But other\ncircumstances soon brought about a\ngreater emphasis on the study of Greek.\nAs the Byzantine Empire crumbled\nbefore the Ottoman Turks, many Greek-\nspeaking refugees fleeing the Aegean\narea settled in Italy, particularly in the\ncity-state of Florence. These refugees\nbrought Greek books with them and\nfounded schools for the study of Greek.\nFigure 12.28 | Santa Maria del Fiore\nIn Western Europe after the fall of the Author: User \u201cEnne\u201d\nWestern Roman Empire in the fifth Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\ncentury, the study of Greek had declined.\nAs a result, most readers had known of the literature\nof Ancient Greece, but they had usually only known it\nin Latin summaries. By the twelfth century, Western\nEuropeans had read the philosophy of Aristotle and\nthe science of Ptolemy, but usually they knew these\nphilosophers only in translations\u2014which had often\nbeen translated from Greek to Arabic to Latin.\nSo a return to the study of Greek meant that\nscholars were now reading Greek literature in its\noriginal language. Manuel Chrysoloras (c. 1350 \u2013\n1415) established a school for the study of Greek in\nFlorence. Western Europeans now had direct access\nto most of the writings of Plato and Homer for the\nfirst time in centuries.\nThis interest in the culture of the ancient world\nalso led to an interest in the art and architecture of\nGreece and Rome. Churches, such as Santa Maria\ndel Fiore in Florence (built between 1420 and 1436),\nsprang up in imitation of the domed temples (and\nchurches) of ancient Rome, while sculptors such as\nFigure 12.29 | Donatello\u2019s David Donatello (1386 \u2013 1466) produced naturalistic sculp-\nAuthor: Donatello tures the like of which had not been seen in more\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthan a thousand years.\nLicense: Public Domain\nPage | 472 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nThis intellectual movement was not simply an\naffair of scholars and artists. Indeed, its impacts would\nbe far-reaching throughout Western Europe. The\nchildren of princes and wealthy merchants gradually\ncame to be educated along humanistic lines, and the\nfashion for a humanistic education would eventually\nspread from Italy to the elites of all Western Europe.\nHumanism\u2019s political impacts would be broad\nranging as well. Since the eighth century, the popes\nhad relied on the text of the Donation of Constantine\nin their struggles with the Holy Roman Empire and\nto demonstrate their right to rule as earthly princes\nas well as to spiritually direct the Church. In 1440,\nthe humanist scholar Lorenzo Valla (1407 \u2013 1457)\nanalyzed the Donation of Constantine\u2014and showed\ndefinitively that it was a forgery. Its Latin writing style\nwas most certainly not the Latin of fourth-century\nFigure 12.30 | Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli Rome. Valla had shown that one of the foundational\nAuthor: Santi di Tito\ndocuments by which the papacy claimed legitimacy\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain as an earthly power was a fraud.\nEven the ideals of how a ruler should govern\ncame under the influence of Renaissance humanism.\nIn his analysis of the historical writings of Ancient\nRome, the humanist Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1469 \u2013\n1527) argued that the circumstances of history show\nthat a prince should not necessarily attempt to rule\nvirtuously, but instead should ruthlessly set aside\nethics and morality in order to accomplish the goals\nof the state. One should note that in many ways rulers\nalready behaved this way, but Machiavelli gave an\nintellectual justification for doing so.\nAnd, of course, an intense study of the language\nof ancient texts would lead to an intense study of the\nancient text that was most important for Western\nEurope of the later Middle Ages: the Bible. Humanists\nsuch as the Dutch scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1469\n\u2013 1536) used the tools of linguistic investigation to\nanalyze the Greek text of the New Testament. Other\nFigure 12.31 | Desiderius Erasmus scholars also began looking at the Bible not with the\nAuthor: Holbein\nintellectual tools of logic and philosophy, but with\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain linguistic analysis. They began to look at such a text\nPage | 473 as it had been written, and not at the intervening fourteen centuries of commentary. The results\nof such reading were explosive.\n12.27 STATES IN THE LATE MIDDLE AGES AND RENAISSANCE\nAs Europe transitioned into the fifteenth century, two of Europe\u2019s most organized states\nremained locked in destructive warfare. England\u2019s king Henry V (r. 1413 \u2013 1422) came close\nto conquering all of France, aided largely by the fact that France itself was riven by a civil war\nbetween two powerful houses of nobles, the Armagnacs and Burgundians. Eventually, however,\nwhen France\u2019s rival houses ended their differences, the unified nation was able to expel English\ntroops, using trained and disciplined infantry funded by a centralized apparatus of taxation. The\nHundred Years\u2019 War thus ended in 1453. England\u2019s loss in France was followed by a civil war\n(usually known as the Wars of the Roses because the rival factions used a red and a white rose,\nrespectively, as their emblems) that lasted from 1455 to 1485.\nIn Northern Italy, at the same time as the brilliant artistic achievements of the Italian\nRenaissance, the city-states of Italy were locked in near-continual warfare until the 1454 Treaty of\nLodi brought almost half a century of peace to the Italian peninsula. That peace would come to an\nend, however, in 1494, when King Charles VIII of France (r. 1483 \u2013 1498) turned the power of the\nnewly consolidated French state to an invasion of Italy. In the wars that followed, the cannons used\nby the French army were able to effortlessly batter down the Italian cities\u2019 and castles\u2019 medieval\nwalls. A new era of warfare was beginning.\n12.28 IBERIA AND THE ATLANTIC: NEW WORLDS\nTo the southwest of Europe, events in Iberia would eventually bring about several changes\nthat would usher in the end of Europe\u2019s Middle Ages and the beginnings of modern times.\nPortugal, Castile, and Aragon were steeped in the traditions of the Reconquista, of expanding\nthe dominion of the Christian world by force of arms. The Reconquista had established a habit\nin the Iberian kingdoms of conquering Muslims lands and reducing their Muslim and Jewish\ninhabitants to subordinate status (or in some cases to outright slavery). By the fifteenth century,\nthese kingdoms had nearly completed the Reconquista. As stated earlier, only Granada remained\nunder Muslim rule.\nMeanwhile, over the fourteenth century, both Venice and the Ottoman Empire had forced\nthe Italian city-state of Genoa out of the Eastern Mediterranean, so its sailors and ship owners\nturned their focus to the western half of the Mediterranean Sea. Constantly on the lookout for new\nmarkets, Genoese merchants already knew from trade with the Islamic Maghreb that West Africa\nwas a source of gold. In 1324, Mansa Musa\u2019s hajj to Mecca (see Chapter Nine) had put so much\ngold into circulation that the price of gold fell by twenty-five percent in the Mediterranean market.\nIf the Muslim rulers of Morocco controlled the overland routes by which gold traveled from Mali\nto the Mediterranean, then perhaps certain sailors could bypass the overland route by sailing into\nthe Atlantic and around the Sahara and arrive at the source of Africa\u2019s gold.\nPage | 474 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nMap 12.11 | Iberia in 1462 CE\nAuthor: Ian Mladjov\nSource: Original Work\nLicense: \u00a9 Ian Mladjov. Used with permission.\nBy 1300, the combination of the compass, a map called the portolan (a map that could accu-\nrately represent coastlines), and ships that by operating on sails rather than oars needed fewer\npeople meant that European navigators could begin venturing into open waters of the Atlantic\nthat the Arabs and Ancient Romans had largely avoided.\nGenoese merchants began tentatively sailing into the Atlantic. In the early 1300s, they were\nregularly visiting the Canary Islands. These merchants (and others from Western Europe) increas-\ningly served in the employ of Iberian kings. In 1404, King Henry III of Castile (r. 1390 \u2013 1406) began\nSpanish efforts to conquer the Canaries and convert their indigenous peoples to Christianity. Over the\nnext century, the Spanish would conquer and settle the islands, driven by the Reconquista ideal of the\nmilitary spread of the Christian faith. In the mid-fifteenth century, the kingdom of Portugal began the\nconquest and colonization of the Azores, nearly 700 miles to the southwest of Iberia in the Atlantic.\nPage | 475 Genoese merchants\nestablished sugar planta-\ntions on these chains of\nislands, and those planta-\ntions were worked by slave\nlabor. Earlier, in the thir-\nteenth century, Venetian\nmerchants had begun to\ngrow sugar (long cultivated\nin the Muslim world) in\ntheir island colonies in the\nMediterranean, and labor\nfor these colonies came from\nthe Mediterranean slave\ntrade. Genoese merchants\ncopied this economic model Map 12.12 | A Portolan Map of Europe and Africa from 1375 CE | Note\nfirst in Sicily and then, when the depiction of Mansa Musa holding a gold nugget on the bottom of the map\nand the Azores and Canaries on the bottom left\nthey began to operate in the\nAuthor: Cresques Abraham\nAtlantic, in the Canaries and Source: Wikimedia Commons\nAzores. Often they would License: Public Domain\npurchase the slaves for these\nplantations from Africans on the continent\u2019s Atlantic coast. Thus began a slave trade that would\nbe as lucrative for its operators as it was brutal for its victims.\nThe lure of African gold drew mariners serving Iberian monarchs south and west. By 1482, the\nPortuguese had established the fort and trading post of S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina on the coast of Guinea. And\nin the Iberian peninsula, in 1479, Isabella, the Queen of Castile, married King Ferdinand II of Aragon,\ncreating a united Spanish kingdom. In 1492, these monarchs, devout Catholics both, completed the\nReconquista, conquering Granada, the last Muslim territory in Spain. All of Spain was now under\nChristian rule, and the king and queen were eager to continue spreading the Catholic religion.\nThey sponsored a voyage by the Genoese sailor Christopher Columbus. Columbus had miscal-\nculated the size of the world, so he believed that it would be possible to sail to Asia by traveling west\nacross the Atlantic Ocean. European mariners knew the world was a sphere but believed that it was\nimpossible to carry adequate supplies to sail around the world due to the sheer distance between\nEurope and Asia. When Columbus made landfall in 1492, it was not in East Asia (for he had in fact\nbeen wrong, drastically underestimating the size of the world), but rather in a set of lands previously\nunknown to the peoples of the Eastern Hemisphere. The world was about to be forever changed.\n12.29 CONCLUSION\nOver the eleventh and twelfth centuries, a rise in agricultural production led to an increase\nin Western Europe\u2019s wealth and population. The chaos of the tenth and eleventh centuries had\nPage | 476 CHAPTER 12: WESTERN EUROPE AND BYZANTIUM CIRCA 1000 - 1500 CE\nbrought about the origin of a feudal system dominated by knights. Feudal Europe was thus able to\nrespond to the Byzantine Empire\u2019s requests for help when its field army was annihilated by Saljuq\nTurks, resulting in the First Crusade and establishment of a set of Crusader States in the Eastern\nMediterranean, but these Crusader states were gradually conquered by Muslim powers over the\nnext two centuries. An army of Crusaders would eventually defeat and break up the Byzantine\nEmpire, and although that empire would be re-established, it was never strong enough to resist\nthe pressure of the Ottoman Turks, who finally conquered it in 1453.\nAs Western Europe grew in population and urbanized, the urban cathedral schools became\nthe center of an increase in intellectual activity over the twelfth century known as the Twelfth-\nCentury Renaissance. Thinkers of the Twelfth-Century Renaissance used the philosophy of the\nAncient Greeks and Arabs to understand the world, and in the thirteenth century the intellectual\nmovement known as scholasticism would seek to reconcile Christianity with Arabic and Ancient\nGreek Philosophy. By the end of the Middle Ages, Europe\u2019s intellectuals would seek to study the\nwritings of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, and not the commentators of the previous thousand\nyears. This movement was known as Renaissance humanism.\nEurope\u2019s states\u2014with the notable exception of the Holy Roman Empire\u2014gradually consoli-\ndated, but the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries saw increasing interstate warfare. The states that\nemerged out of this endemic war, however, were more militarily powerful and more centralized.\nAt the same time, sailors in the service of Spain and Portugal were exploring the Atlantic and West\nAfrica until the close of the fifteenth century, when Western Europeans discovered the existence\nof the continents of the Western Hemisphere.\n12.30 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBackman, Clifford R.
