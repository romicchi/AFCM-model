{"text":"Metacognitive Critical Reading\nWhat is metacognition? Metacognition is, very literally, \u201cthinking about our thinking.\u201d\nSure. But what does that mean? And why does it matter?\nWe are metacognitive readers when we work to understand by actively summarizing\ncontent as we go along, making connections with what we already know, asking\nquestions about what we don\u2019t understand, making predictions about an author\u2019s main\npoints, and noticing and adjusting our approach to pay closer attention to the text: \u201cAs\nstudents become more skilled at using metacognitive strategies, they gain confidence\nand become more independent as learners\u201d (EAL Center).\nHere are some words we might associate with metacognition:\n\u2022 Self-perceptive,\n\u2022 Self-regulating,\n\u2022 Self-understanding,\n\u2022 Self-assessing, and\n\u2022 Self-correcting.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 22 METACOGNITIVE ACTIVITIES\nThe following table presents easy steps to metacognitive strategies to your reading\nand study habits in this course and beyond.\nWhen you know when and\nwhat actually works for you\nwhen you study, you can\nmake a plan accordingly AND\nthat might change from class\nMaking a Plan to class. What works in your\nEnglish class might not be the\nsame thing that works in\nHistory, Business, or\nChemistry. Being honest with\nyourself when something\ndoesn\u2019t work is a part of this,\nas well.\nWhen you pause while\nreading, writing, researching,\nor studying to check your\nunderstanding, you\u2019re being\nChecking your metacognitive. For example,\nUnderstanding maybe after reading a couple\nof paragraphs of an essay,\nyou pause to see if you could\nput what you just read into\nyour own words. If you can,\nthen you know you\u2019ve\nunderstood and you can move\non. If you can\u2019t, then maybe\nyou need to go back and try a\ndifferent strategy. Either way,\nit\u2019s metacognitive.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 23 As you develop\nmetacognition, you may begin\nDeveloping an to notice what distracts you\nAwareness of so you can avoid it. You can\nDistraction do this without judgment--\neverybody gets distracted by\nsomething! If you know, then\nyou can make choices about\nwhere and when to focus.\nIf you\u2019ve had experience with\na topic, then you can bring\nwhat you already know about\nUsing Prior the topic to the reading,\nKnowledge to Plan writing, or conversation. If\nyou\u2019ve had experience with\ngenre, then you can bring\nprevious strategies that have\nworked back to the table to\nwork again!\nUse questions to ask yourself\nhow well you\u2019re doing and\nmake adjustments as\nnecessary. Once you\u2019ve\nfinished an assignment, take\na moment to ask yourself\nMonitoring & evaluation questions like\nEvaluating\n\u2022 What went well as I\nread\/studied? Why?\n\u2022 What was difficult? Why?\n\u2022 What could I do differently or\nbetter next time?\n\u2022 What progress do I see\nmyself making from\nassignment to assignment?\nClass to class?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 24 Strategy: Preview Reading Assignments\nPreviewing reading assignments helps you think about your purpose for reading before\nyou start to read. It also helps you connect new content to what you already know,\nmaking it easier to stay interested and focused on the reading.\nHere\u2019s a list of questions to ask yourself before you start to read:\n\u2022 Why did my professor assign this? What does she want me to get out of this?\n\u2022 What do I need to do with this information after I read it?\n\u2022 What\u2019s this text about?\n\u2022 What do I already know about it?\n\u2022 What questions do I have that this text might answer?\nStrategy: Talk to the Text\nYou also might have heard this called \u201cannotating,\u201d which is just a fancy way of saying\nthat you take notes. We encourage you to use a pen or pencil instead of a highlighter if\nyou\u2019re marking on a hardcopy page. You can underline, place a star, write a question\nmark, summarize difficult ideas, or ask questions in the margins. Many PDF readers\nallow you to do similar work, as well. Or, you can use an online system like Perusall,\nHypothesis, or PowerNotes.\nIt\u2019s metacognitive because as you read you\u2019re constantly interacting with the text and\nchecking your understanding.\nStrategy: Asking Questions\nAsking questions is a really important way to interact with a text. We can ask questions\nabout a reading before we read, while we\u2019re reading, and after we read. Each has its\nown benefits.\nBefore reading, when previewing text, use questions to help you connect to prior\nknowledge or pique your curiosity about the text.\n\u2022 What ideas here am I already familiar with?\n\u2022 What doesn\u2019t seem familiar that I want to know more about?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 25 \u2022 What do I know about this genre (newspaper article, journal article, chapter in a\nbook, blog posting, etc.)?\n\u2022 What expectations do I have about this? Why?\nWhile reading, use questions to check your understanding of the text.\n\u2022 What did that paragraph just say?\n\u2022 What have I found difficult about this section, and why?\n\u2022 What am I reading that\u2019s pointing me toward new information or ideas that are\nunfamiliar?\n\u2022 What key words are repeated or stand out?\n\u2022 What passages are standing out to me as important, interesting, or confusing?\nAfter reading, consider what you still want to know or need to review.\n\u2022 What am I still not understanding that I might want to come back to?\n\u2022 Can I identify the thesis or main point of what I just read?\n\u2022 What was the most difficult section (if any)?\n\u2022 How would I summarize the text in just one word? One sentence?\nStrategy: Double-Entry Notes\nDouble-Entry Notes allow the reader to consider a text (whether an essay, a poem, a\nshort story, a video, a newspaper article, or whatever) from two different perspectives.\nOne way to do this is with an E-I Notetaker, focusing on evidence and interpretation.\nIn the evidence column, you put facts: what quotes, data, information, ideas from the\ntext are interesting or important?\nIn the interpretation column, you put your thoughts on the evidence: what is important,\nrelevant, significant, confusing, or difficult about the text?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 26 Evidence Interpretation\nDouble-Entry Notes work really well when the text has an audio function to it, so\npodcast episodes, movies, videos, newscasts, or even lectures! Then it might look like\nthis.\nLecture Notes Responses, Reactions, Analysis, & Questions\nFor difficult texts, your instructor might have you do your double-entry notes more like\nthis example. They might even ask you to find specific aspects of the text like when the\nauthor uses an emotional appeal or integrates their own outside sources.\nQuote and Page Commentary\nNumber \/\nThoughts\nThe vocabulary might look a little different, but all of these double-entry notes\napproaches help you read more deeply and more critically and prepare you for\nintellectual work like analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 27 Strategy: STC Method\nIn the STC Method, readers use metacognitive strategies to acknowledge what they\nalready know and then build on that to process new information. This strategy can be\nused as an annotation-only approach or as a combination annotation and note-taking\nstrategy. It is deceptively simple because it is extremely easy to use but speaks to\ndeep transactional reading activity.\nSquare = \u201cThis squares with what I already know.\u201d\nTriangle = \u201cThis points to new information.\u201d\nCircle = \u201cI have a question about this, and I\u2019d like to process it more before I circle back\naround to it.\u201d\nTo use as an annotation strategy: Simply use a writing utensil of some kind to draw\nsquares \u30ed, triangles , and circles \u09e6 in the margins as they relate to how you process\nwhat you\u2019re reading.\n\u25b3\nTo use as a note-taking strategy: Add in a table like this to reflect on the annotations.\nShape Quote\/Information Your Thoughts\nSquares\nTriangles\nCircles\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 28 Strategy: KWL-Q\nThe KWL-Q method asks you to build on previous knowledge, check your\nunderstanding, and ask questions. The letters represent these questions:\nWhat do you already KNOW about the topic?\nWhat do you WANT to know about the topic?\nWhat have you LEARNED about the topic?\nWhat QUESTIONS do you still have about the topic?\nThe first two questions are answered before reading a text; the second two, after. The\ntable below can be used to help students walk through and visualize the process.\nK W L Q\nWhat do you already What do you want What have you What questions do\nknow about the topic to know about the learned about you have about the\ntopic? the topic? topic?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 29 KWL-Q is metacognitive because it requires readers to self-regulate their\nunderstanding by tracing a line from what they already know to what they still want to\nlearn. There are no right or wrong answers, but the interactions are based on your\npersonal interaction with the text.\nAs you go through this semester in this class, future semesters, and other classes, you\nwill discover which strategies work best for you or best in which kinds of classes or for\nparticular kinds of texts. The bottom line is that reading something so deeply that you\u2019ll\nremember it and be able to use it later is really difficult, but it\u2019s also absolutely\nessential to your success in college. As you practice more, it will feel more natural and\ncome more easily to you.\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about the science of critical reading and how to make it work\nfor you, check out David Handel\u2019s \u201cHow to Read Academic Content Once and\nRemember it Forever.\u201d\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 30 Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric in a\nNutshell\nLet\u2019s be honest. Most of you are going to say that you\u2019re in this class because you have\nto be. We get that. It doesn\u2019t keep you from learning, from gaining intellectual habits\nthat you can take into other courses, or from learning to communicate information in\nways that will be useful for your entire life. Many factors will play into your classroom\nexperience including your instructor, your previous experiences with English classes,\nyour classmates, and what you bring to the table. Every section of the course, however,\nhas shared goals, learning outcomes, and assignments that should be consistent for\nevery student in English 101: Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric.\nIn the big picture, program goals will enable students to\n\u2022 Begin to understand college-level expectations for critical reading, critical\nthinking, and sophisticated writing.\n\u2022 Leave the course feeling more confident to tackle reading, thinking, and writing\ngoals in other general education courses, in program courses, and leaving the\nuniversity.\n\u2022 Understand more clearly that every context, every audience, every situation has\na different purpose for reading and writing and that they can be insightful and\nflexible enough to meet each situation with what is required.\n\u2022 Meet some people who are new to EKU.\n\u2022 Have a resource in the instructor, who can help new students negotiate the first\nyear of college.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nThe university sets certain standards for what all courses should teach and expect of\nstudents. For English 101, these are the general education goals set by the university.\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Communicate effectively by applying skills in reading, writing, speaking, and\nlistening and through appropriate use of information technology.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 31 2. Use appropriate methods of critical thinking and quantitative reasoning to\nexamine issues and to identify solutions.\n3. Integrate knowledge that will deepen their understanding of, and will inform their\nown choices about, issues of personal and public importance.\nThose are great! But, we also have some more specific things we want to get done, as\nwell.\nAt the end of the semester, students will be able to:\n1. Demonstrate comprehension of significant concepts in primary texts.\n2. Provide analysis by recognizing the parts or aspects of texts that contribute\nto understanding the purposes of texts.\n3. Connect and integrate concepts from texts to construct and support\nexplanations, conclusions, or arguments through the use of paraphrase,\nsummary, and direct quotations, appropriately cited in a standard format.\n4. Evaluate texts by looking at genre, tone, audience, purpose, or other\nrhetorical features.\n5. Organize a composition around a thesis, claims, and supporting evidence\nfrom primary texts and present effective transitions between\npoints\/paragraphs.\n6. Demonstrate recognition of a rhetorical situation and audience and develop\nan appropriate voice for that situation through paragraphing, sentence\nstructure, variation, rhythm, phrasing, and word choice.\n7. Present writing that is clear, accurate, and precise.\n8. Use punctuation, grammar, capitalization, citation format, etc. with minor or\nminimal errors that do not interfere with clarity.\nMAJOR ASSIGNMENTS\nAlmost all sections of English 101, English 101R, English 101Z, or English 101RZ will\nfollow a similar pattern of the major assignments, leading to a final portfolio.\nOur standard assignments include:\n\u2022 Literacy Narrative\n\u2022 Analysis\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 32 \u2022 Textual Synthesis\n\u2022 ePortfolio\nDo \u201canalysis\u201d and \u201csynthesis\u201d sound like work you don\u2019t know how to do? Yeah. We\u2019ve\nbeen there. Don\u2019t worry, though. Your instructor\u2019s going to explain everything for you\nand every major assignment will be completed in steps in a process.\nLiteracy Narrative\nPurpose: The literacy narrative is your opportunity to connect your previous\nexperiences with reading and writing, whether in your personal life or school, and to\nthink deeply about your goals for your continued development in college.\nTask: You\u2019ll be asked to make a statement of purpose (like a thesis) that makes a\nclaim about your literacy experiences and then provide evidence to support that claim.\nYou might also be asked to bring in quotes or points from one of the readings in this\ntextbook.\nAnalysis\nPurpose: This assignment will ask you to move beyond what you can see on the\nsurface (comprehension) and into the potential connections and meanings beneath the\nsurface of a text (analysis). Analysis is often more intellectually difficult than\ncomprehension, but it is also more rewarding and more interesting.\nTask: You will write an essay or create another type of text (podcast\/audio essay,\nvideo, etc.) that makes an analytical argument about a chosen text. Your instructor will\nhelp you choose a text and may require a particular kind: a piece of art, a song, an\nessay from the textbook, or something else. Choose something that you find at least\nsomewhat interesting!\nSynthesis\nPurpose: By this point in the semester, you\u2019re moving into more sophisticated\nintellectual work. While an analysis focuses deeply and specifically on one text, a\nsynthesis makes connections across several texts. In this assignment, you\u2019ll learn how\nto use critical reading techniques to read and really understand several essays\n(probably 3-5) and then to create a project that says something interesting about those\ntexts.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 33 Task: You will write an essay or create another type of text (podcast\/audio essay,\nvideo, etc.) that integrates multiple sources to make a single point, a thesis-driven\nargument.. Your instructor will guide you about how to choose your texts.\nePortfolio\nPurpose: A portfolio gives authors the opportunity to show their audience the very best\nof their work and\/or the ways they have improved over a period of time.\nTask: This ePortfolio is required for every student in English 101, 101R, 101Z, and\n101RZ, and the assignment is almost exactly the same for everyone. Follow your\ninstructor\u2019s directions, but your ePortfolio will include these five exhibits. The portfolio\nwill receive a holistic grade (i.e., one grade for the whole thing together) using the First-\nYear Writing Rubric.\n1. Reflective Introduction\n2. Polished Project Exhibit\n3. Process Exhibit\n4. Peer Review Exhibit\n5. Wild Card\nASSESSMENT RUBRIC\nIn order to keep us and students on task with these goals, we use what\u2019s called a rubric\nto give feedback on the work of the course. Here\u2019s how it works.\n1. The competent-level categories directly line up with our program goals listed\nabove, so you can clearly see what is most important.\n2. As you work to achieve these goals, you can also begin the intellectual work\ninvolved to be more persuasive and then more accomplished. The\naccomplished terms are based on Paul & Elder\u2019s Intellectual Standards, a\ntried-and-tested framework for deeper thinking.\n3. Our rubric isn\u2019t based on any certain number of points gained or lost. It\u2019s\nwhat we call \u201cholistic,\u201d which just means that we look at assignments and\nthe work put into it as a whole rather than picking it apart by pieces. In other\nwords, how does it all fit together?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 34 4. The rubric can have many different purposes:\n- When used as a guide for you, the rubric can help you reflect on your\ngoals for the course.\n- Used as a peer review instrument, it gives you vocabulary to discuss\ncourse work with your classmates.\n- As a grading tool, it allows your instructor to show you what you\u2019re doing\nwell and what still needs some improvement.\n5. For students who are really struggling with the competency standards, you\nand your instructor should have a conversation about what support we can\noffer you to help you achieve your goals for the course.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 35 C = COMPETENT\nA competent text meets the following standards:\nAssignment Standards\n___ Follows assignment instructions as specified by the instructor.\n___ Is organized as the assignment requires (summary, narrative, argument, analysis,\netc.).\n___ Meets assignment requirements for length, genre, approach, or rhetorical situation.\nCritical Reading & Development\n___ Demonstrates comprehension of significant concepts in texts.\n___ Provides analysis by recognizing the parts or aspects of texts that contribute to\nunderstanding the purpose of texts.\n___ Connects and integrates concepts from texts to construct and support\nexplanations, conclusions, or arguments, appropriately cited in a standard\nformat.\n___ Evaluates texts by looking at genre, tone, audience, purpose, or other rhetorical\nfeatures.\n___ Organizes around a thesis, claims, and supporting evidence.\nConventions of Academic Writing\n___ Demonstrates recognition of a rhetorical situation and audience.\n___ Presents writing that is clear and accurate.\n___ Uses punctuation, grammar, capitalization, citation format, etc. with minor or\nminimal errors that do not interfere with clarity.\nB = PERSUASIVE\nA persuasive text meets the following standards in addition to the competency\nstandards above:\n___ Presents effective transitions between paragraphs and between sentences.\n___ Develops voice through paragraphing, sentence structure, variation, rhythm,\nphrasing, and word choice.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 36 ___ Develops points thoroughly with specific and concrete evidence (ex: quotes, data,\nstatistics).\n___ Engages with an appropriate number and kind of reliable sources for support.\n___ Integrates evidence from outside sources smoothly and with precise\ndocumentation in a relevant citation style.\nA = ACCOMPLISHED\nAn accomplished essay distinguishes itself through one or more of the following\ncharacteristics in addition to meeting the competent and persuasive standards above:\nClarity Accuracy Precision Relevance\nDepth Breadth Logic Significance\nFairness Seamless Coherence Sophistication Recognizable Voice\nD = DEVELOPING (60-69)\nA text is developing and will receive a D if it attempts to establish a controlling purpose\nbut fails to competently maintain unity throughout the composition. This text may also\nlack audience awareness, coherence, and\/or evidence and\/or have several problems\nwith the conventions of academic writing. You should schedule a conference with your\ninstructor if your text earns a D.\nF = BEGINNING\/INEFFECTIVE\nA text that does not meet the basic standards of competency will receive an F. In this\ncase, you should schedule a conference with your instructor to discuss your ability to be\nsuccessful in the class.\nThis text does not meet competency standards because:\n\u2022 it shows minor problems in all areas, or\n\u2022 major problems in one or two competence areas.\nThe most common reasons for receiving an F include unintentional plagiarism, failure\nto meet assignment requirements such as length or research, or lack of a controlling\npurpose or thesis.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 37 If you are found to have plagiarized intentionally, your paper will be removed from this\ngeneral rubric, and we will follow guidelines for an infraction of Academic Integrity. You\ncan see EKU\u2019s Academic Integrity policy at www.academicintegrity.eku.edu.\nThese assignments have been designed with student learning in mind in this very order\nto help students connect previous experiences to new ones, read more deeply, create\neffective academic projects, and reflect on the process to prepare for success moving\nforward. These descriptions are an overview, so students should always follow\nindividual instructor\u2019s instructions.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 38 Rhetorical Awareness in College\nWriting\nRhetoric is its own unique field of study, with scholarship covering genre analysis,\nworkplace rhetoric, medical rhetoric, religious rhetoric, rhetoric of popular culture,\nrhetoric of games, political rhetoric, just to name a few popular areas of study. This\nchapter is meant as a short introduction to the basics of rhetoric. Your instructor may\nintroduce you to additional approaches to using and analyzing rhetoric in your writing,\nsuch as Rogerian Argument, the Toulmin Model, or Listening Rhetoric, while in ENG\n102 you will look more at academic genres and uses of rhetoric. Courses in your\nmajor\u2014while they might not always use the term rhetoric\u2014will teach you the\nspecialized ways that rhetoric is used in your field to make arguments, build credibility,\nand communicate with other specialists as well as with clients and the public. Use this\nand the other sections in this book about rhetoric as a foundation for thinking about\nhow language is used in very intentional ways to communicate with others\u2014to inform,\nto persuade, and even, at times, to delight.\nWhat is Rhetoric?\nRhetoric is essentially how effectively or persuasively a person is able to present ideas\nwhen speaking, writing, or communicating through various modalities. Early study of\nrhetoric focused on rhetoric as the study of persuasion; modern rhetoric considers all\nforms of communication and meaning-making, from how advertisers use words,\nimage, and sound to make a product appealing, to how a film director presents a\nparticular worldview, to how video games create emotional responses like fear, delight,\nor laughter in players. The study of rhetoric itself is wide-ranging and deep, a scholarly\nfield in its own right just like History, Political Science, or Education. In this text, we\ntouch on the surface, enough to help you develop effective reading and composing\nskills. For purposes of a first-year writing course\u2014which this book was designed for\u2014\nrhetoric is often employed in two major ways: analytically, as a way of reading; and\ncreatively, as a tool for writers to make their work more effective.\nIn terms of reading comprehension and writing techniques, understanding rhetoric\ninvolves moving beyond basic level comprehension to consider not just what is being\nstated but how it is being presented. Rhetorically understanding a text means a reader\nis able to focus on what the author is saying, how information is arranged, and the\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 39 context of the information. Areas of the text that need to be considered include the\nauthor\u2019s purpose (why are they writing), audience (to whom are they writing), style,\nexpectations (both the author\u2019s and the audience\u2019s; this may include expectations of\noutcome, content, and form), potential biases, the medium of the composition (such as\nonline or print), and any other elements which contribute to its overall purpose.\nQuestions to consider when analyzing a text:\n\u2022 Who is the author?\n\u2022 What is the author\u2019s main idea?\n\u2022 How does the author support their central claims?\n\u2022 What is the author\u2019s main purpose?\n\u2022 What is the tone and\/or style of the piece?\n\u2022 Does the author appeal to any logical, emotional or ethical concerns?\nYou may have had classes before that have used similar questions to look closely at\nliterary texts. These questions can be applied productively to other kinds of texts as\nwell, such as political speeches, advertisements, university announcements, health\nwarnings, and so much more. These questions are also very important to critical\nthinking and critical reading. They urge readers to look more deeply at texts, not just to\nunderstand their meaning, as traditional close reading of literary or historical texts you\nmay have done in other classes, but to look at the why and the how. Understanding the\npurpose behind a text can reveal a lot. Rhetorical study will help you to realize that very\nrarely is a text\u2019s only purpose just to inform or to entertain\u2014texts reflect the underlying\nbeliefs of the author or their intended audience, and even a seemingly unbiased piece\nof writing will often act to either support or challenge those beliefs or world views.\nReading texts rhetorically helps you to become a better critical reader and thinker. One\nreason to study rhetoric in a first-year college class is that it helps you to become more\naware of how the creators of the media that surround us\u2014film, television, news,\nadvertising, literature, social media, and more\u2014are shaping our perceptions of reality.\nUnderstanding rhetoric can help you become a more active, savvy consumer of media,\none who can still enjoy those media but who also questions and draws their own\nconclusions.\nWe also study rhetoric in college classes as a way to become better communicators\nand content creators ourselves. Studying how others have effectively used rhetoric in\ntheir writing can help you recognize strategies that you may use in your own work. In\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 40 fact, much of learning to write in the discipline of your major or career area is a study\nof rhetoric: by learning to recognize the expectations or genre conventions of different\ndisciplines and forms of writing, you learn how to communicate effectively within that\nfield. Study of rhetoric in courses like First Year Writing or in Professional and\nTechnical Writing helps you learn what to look for when writing in other fields and\ndisciplines.\nThe Importance of Audience\nAt its heart, rhetoric\u2014whether using it as an analytical tool or as a means to make your\nown writing and communication more effective\u2014is all about the audience. We use the\nterm audience to mean readers, listeners, viewers, as well as more active participants,\nlike players of a game, users of a website, or other interactive texts or events. Content-\ncreators (authors, directors, composers, advertisers, etc.) create with an audience in\nmind. Effective content-creators will shape their work to meet (and sometimes\npurposefully challenge) the needs and expectations of their audience. When reading\nanother person\u2019s text, it\u2019s important to know who their audience is so we can look at\nthe techniques they use to reach, move, or persuade that audience.\nThe rest of this chapter addresses various ways authors and other content-creators\nconnect with audiences. We\u2019ll start by looking at the rhetorical situation, a way of\nlooking at the context shared by author, audience, and text. Then we\u2019ll look at what are\noften called the rhetorical appeals, the three major categories of persuading or moving\nan audience.\nWhat is the Rhetorical Situation?\nAdapted from Rhetorical Concepts, provided by Robin Jeffrey, About Writing: A Guide, Revised Edition\nDuring your time as a student of writing, you may hear instructors talk about \u201crhetorical\nsituations.\u201d This is a term used for any set of circumstances in which one person is\ntrying to change another person\u2019s mind about something, whether through speaking or\nvia written text (like a book, or blog post, or journal article).\nThese rhetorical situations can be better understood by examining the rhetorical\nconcepts that they are built from: text, author, audience, purposes, and setting.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 41 Text\nTexts can come in all shapes and sizes, such as those listed earlier. But in this context,\ntext is not limited to something written down. The text in a rhetorical situation could be\na film, or a photograph, or a recording of a song or spoken history. The important thing\nto ask yourself when faced with a text, no matter what it is, is what is gained by having\nthe text composed in this format\/genre. What are the relevant characteristics of a book\nversus a song? What might an oral history version of a text communicate that a book\nversion would not?\nAuthor\nHere the \u201cauthor\u201d of a text is the creator, the person utilizing communication to try to\neffect a change in their audience. An author doesn\u2019t have to be a single person, or a\nperson at all\u2014an author could be an organization. To understand the rhetorical\nsituation of a text, examine the identity of the author and their background. Not only do\nyou want to know what kind of experience they have in the subject, but you\u2019ll also want\nto explore basic biographical information about them. Where and when did they grow\nup? How could that affect their perspective on the topic?\nNote: You may read in other sources or hear your instructor use the term rhetor to refer\nto what we\u2019re calling the author in this chapter. The term rhetor opens up a greater\nrange of roles (such as speaker, artist, designer, etc.) and so is sometimes preferable\nto author. We use the more familiar author in this book for its recognizability, as well as\nbecause of our focus on texts in the course this book is designed for.\nAudience\nThe audience is any person or group who is the intended recipient of the text, and also\nthe person\/people the text is trying to influence. To understand the rhetorical situation\nof a text, examine who the intended audience is and what their background may be. An\naudiences\u2019 assumptions about the author, the context in which they are receiving the\ntext, their own demographic information (age, gender, etc.) can all affect how the text\nis seeking to engage with them.\nThe intended or i audience often differs from the actual audience in important ways,\nand being aware of those differences is important when analyzing or interpreting a\ntext. The differences are often most apparent when examining older texts, where our\npresent-day knowledge and values may differ greatly from those of the audience an\nauthor originally wrote for. Even in contemporary pieces, texts may (and often do!)\nreach audiences other than those they were intended for: think of examples when\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 42 internal corporate documents are leaked to the general public. As writers, consider\nhow your own compositions, both formal and informal, might be read and interpreted\nby multiple audiences, not just the ideal audience you are thinking about while writing.\nPurposes (Telos)\nWhat is the author hoping to achieve with the communication of this text? What do they\nwant from their audience? What does the audience want from the text and what may\nthey do once the text is communicated? Both author and audience can have purpose\nand it\u2019s important to understand what those might be in the rhetorical situation of the\ntext you are examining. An author may be trying to inform, to convince, to define, to\nannounce, or to activate, while an audience\u2019s purpose may be to receive notice, to\nquantify, to feel a sense of unity, to disprove, to understand, or to criticize. Any and all\nof these purposes determine the \u2018why\u2019 behind the decisions both groups make.\nSometimes the author and audience might begin with different purposes, in which case\nthe author will need to work hard to shift the purpose or telos for the audience\u2014to bring\nthem around to recognizing their purpose as an important one\u2014before they are able to\nmove on with informing or persuading the audience.\nSetting (Kairos)\nNothing happens in a vacuum, and that includes the text you are trying to understand.\nIt was written in a specific time, context, and\/or place, all of which can affect the way\nthe text communicates its message. To understand the rhetorical situation of a text,\nexamine the setting of both audience and author and ask yourself if there was a\nparticular occasion or event that prompted the particular text at the particular time it\nwas written.\nKairos is often translated as timeliness, which emphasizes the importance of time or\ntiming in a rhetorical situation. Discussion of time as part of a rhetorical situation\nmight range from the expansive to the minute: the early 21st century was a time of\ngreat technological change; 2020 was the time for virtual classrooms; the first day of\nclass may not have been the best time for a pandemic joke.\nRhetorical Appeals\nConsideration of rhetoric goes beyond the situation that shapes it; whether analyzing a\npiece or writing our own, we also need to consider the specific strategies that can be\nused to reach an audience effectively within the confines or limitations of a rhetorical\nsituation. The classical philosopher Aristotle provides us with three major types of\nrhetorical strategies or approaches, known as the rhetorical appeals. They\u2019re called\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 43 appeals because they represent ways of appealing to an audience, of giving them\n\u201creasons to believe\u201d what the author is trying to persuade them of. These appeals are\noften referred to by the classical terms used by Aristotle: Logos, Ethos, and Pathos.\n1. Logos\u2014Logical Reasoning: An author who employs logos presents careful structure\nand objective evidence to appeal to the audience.\n2. Ethos\u2014Ethical and Credible: When an author makes an ethical appeal, they mean to\nconnect with certain values of the audience in order to offer a deeper sense of the\nauthor\u2019s credibility. Ethos can be further broken down into intrinsic ethos and\nextrinsic ethos.\na. Intrinsic ethos refers to the ways the author creates or builds credibility within\nthe text itself; the inclusion of source citations in a research paper is one such\nstrategy. Another common strategy is sharing information that links the author\nfirst-hand to the topic, such as direct experience, training or expertise, or new,\noriginal research or investigation.\nb. Extrinsic ethos refers to things outside of or external to the text, but still\nconnected to the author, such as if the author is well known or famous for other\nwork.\n3. Pathos\u2014Emotional: When an author relies on pathos, it means they are attempting\nto connect with an audience\u2019s emotions to ultimately persuade them to understand\nor adopt the author\u2019s claim. Pathos may draw upon the full range of emotions.\nRemember, a pathos appeal is directed towards influencing the audience\u2019s\nemotions so that audience members may feel or imagine feeling a certain way\u2014\nemotion does not need to be the subject of the text, nor does it always need to\ninclude the author\u2019s emotions (although it may).\nThe rhetorical appeals often work together, and are not mutually exclusive: a well-\ncrafted text will often involve all three, linking the appeals together to support one\nanother. A logical appeal (logos) is often more effective if tied to supporting facts from\nrelevant, reliable research by experts (ethos), while connecting the information to\nsomething emotionally impactful (pathos). For example, a detailed plan for providing\nafter-school programs for children in poverty-stricken areas that shows the plight of\nthose children if they do not receive those benefits, alongside research-based evidence\nof the health, educational, and emotional gains for children who do participate in\nsimilar programs combines the three appeals in a way that resonates with policy\nmakers and voters on many different levels.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 44 Types of Logos\nLogos is the use of logic and reasoning to convince or persuade an audience to accept\na point of view or take a course of action. Formal writing situations, such as workplace\nand many classroom-based assignments expect and highly value the use of logos.\nLogos goes beyond the mere presentation of facts and information: it does something\nwith that information; it uses it to make a point, such as to support a formal thesis\nstatement, or to convince the audience to act in a certain way. Logos arguments do not\nalways have to be formal: a logical, step-by-step decision-making process of why\nsomeone who is buying a new phone should choose one brand or model over another\nis just as much a use of logos as is a twenty\u2013page report addressed to stockholders\nexplaining why they should or should not support a new business acquisition. The point\nis, logos (and all the appeals) scale in complexity and can be used in many diverse\nsituations.\nLogos can take many forms, but two very common forms are the use of Deductive\nReasoning and Inductive Reasoning to build connections between information and an\nargument.\nDeductive Reasoning vs. Inductive Reasoning:\n\u2022 Deductive refers to making logical conclusions among connected sentences and\nideas.\nExample: \u201cIf Pepsi is a soda and soda has too much sugar, then Pepsi must have too\nmuch sugar.\u201d\n\u2022 Inductive refers to more general conclusions stemming from specific evidence.\nExample: \u201cI learned that students perform better in a classroom setting after observing\na workshop on classroom management.\u201d\nAlso, be aware of and avoid logical fallacies in which conclusions are drawn from a\nseries of vaguely related ideas.\nExample: \u201cIf we legalize marijuana, then people will be more likely to use heroin.\u201d This\nfallacious argument is an example of a \u201cslippery slope\u201d argument. Be on the lookout\nfor this and other logical fallacies, such as those listed below.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 45 Informal Fallacies, provided by Lumen Learning\nA fallacy is usually an error in reasoning often due to a misconception or a\npresumption. Some of the more frequent common logical fallacies are:\n\u2022 Hasty generalization: argues from limited examples or a special case to a\ngeneral rule. Argument: Every person I\u2019ve met has ten fingers, therefore, all\npeople have ten fingers. Problem: Those \u201cwho have been met\u201d are not a\nrepresentative subset of the entire set.\n\u2022 Making the argument personal (argumentum ad hominem): attacking or\ndiscrediting the opposition\u2019s character. Argument: What do you know about the\nU.S? You aren\u2019t even a citizen. Problem: personal argument against an\nopponent, instead of against the opponent\u2019s argument.\n\u2022 Popular sentiment or bandwagon appeal (argumentum ad populum): an appeal\nto the majority; appeal to loyalty. Argument: Everyone is doing it. Problem:\nConcludes a proposition to be true because many or most people believe it.\n\u2022 Red herring (Ignoratio Elenchi): intentionally or unintentionally misleading or\ndistracting from the actual issue. Argument: I think that we should make the\nacademic requirements stricter for students. I recommend that you support this\nbecause we are in a budget crisis and we do not want our salaries affected.\nProblem: Here the second sentence, though used to support the first, does not\naddress the topic of the first sentence, instead switching the focus to the quite\ndifferent topic.\n\u2022 Fallacy of false cause (non sequitur): incorrectly assumes one thing is the cause\nof another. Non Sequitur is Latin for \u201cIt does not follow. \u201d Argument: I hear the\nrain falling outside my window; therefore, the sun is not shining. Problem: The\nconclusion is false because the sun can shine while it is raining.\n\u2022 If it comes before it is the cause (post hoc ergo propter hoc): believing that\ntemporal succession implies a causal relation. Argument: It rained just before\nthe car died. The rain caused the car to break down. Problem: There may be no\nconnection between the two events.\n\u2022 Two events co-occurring is not causation (cum hoc ergo propter hoc): believing\nthat correlation implies a causal relation. Argument: More cows die in the\nsummer. More ice cream is consumed in summer months. Therefore, the\nconsumption of ice cream in the summer is killing cows. Problem: No premise\nsuggests the ice cream consumption is causing the deaths. The deaths and\nconsumption could be unrelated, or something else could be causing both, such\nas summer heat.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 46 \u2022 Fallacy of many questions or loaded questions (Plurium Interrogationum):\ngroups more than one question in the form of a single question. Argument: Have\nyou stopped beating your wife? Problem: Either a yes or no answer is an\nadmission of guilt to beating your wife.\n\u2022 Straw man: creates the illusion of having refuted a proposition by replacing it\nwith a superficially similar proposition (the \u201cstraw man\u201d), and refuting it, without\never actually refuting the original. Argument: Person A: Sunny days are good\nPerson B: If all days were sunny, we\u2019d never have rain, and without rain, we\u2019d\nhave famine and death. Therefore, you are wrong. Problem: B has\nmisrepresented A\u2019s claim by falsely suggesting that A claimed that only sunny\ndays are good, and then B refuted the misrepresented version of the claim,\nrather than refuting A\u2019s original assertion.\n\u2022 The false dilemma or either-or fallacy: the listener is forced to make a choice\nbetween two things which are not really related or relevant. Argument: If you are\nnot with us, you are against us. Problem: The presentation of a false choice\noften reflects a deliberate attempt to eliminate any middle ground.\n\u2022 Card-stacking, or cherry picking: deliberate action is taken to bias an argument\nby selective use of facts with opposing evidence being buried or discredited.\nArgument: Learn new skills, become a leader and see the world. Problem: Only\nthe positive benefits of military service are used to recruit, and not the hazards.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 47 Audience\nA key area of understanding and responding to a rhetorical situation involves\nconnecting with a specific audience. Beyond simply writing to generic readers or\ncitizens of the world, authors use specific rhetorical strategies depending on their\naudience.\nBefore you can analyze how effectively an author engages an audience, you must first\nthink about that audience. An audience is any collective intended recipient of the text\nand also the person or group the author wants to influence. Ask these questions when\ninterpreting the rhetorical situation of a text:\n\u2022 Who is the author addressing (professionals, academic community, etc.)?\n\u2022 What background, interests, or values come into play when communicating to\nthat audience?\n\u2022 What context does the audience need (situational circumstances, historical\ncontext, supporting details, necessary evidence, etc.)?\n\u2022 What style or voice is appropriate for the audience?\n\u2022 What is the audience\u2019s perspective in terms of their likelihood to agree or\ndisagree?\n\u2022 What should your audience do with this information?\nThink back to the last paper you wrote. Did you have an audience in mind for the\npaper? Did it feel like you were only writing to the teacher? Focusing only on the\nteacher as audience often leaves us fixated on the \"correctness\" of writing rather than\ndevoting energy to shaping our rhetoric to reflect the values of a specific audience.\nNow, consider your most recent Facebook post or Tweet. You were probably hyper-\naware of your audience and how what you posted or shared might affect them or what\ntheir reaction might be. Knowing that you already have experiences with audience\nexpectations should help you understand the \"how\" of writing rather than simply \"what\"\nyou are writing in relation to your audience.\nTypes of Audiences\nThe Imagined Audience: You may be asked to write to an audience of your own\nconstruction or one that has broadly defined values and interests. Try to think outside\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 48 of simply writing to your teacher but consider, based on your purpose and main idea,\nwho would benefit the most from receiving this information. What do you want them to\ndo with this information?\nDiscourse Communities: This should be an audience you are more familiar with in your\nwriting because you regularly engage in the communication unique to this community.\nThis could be cultural languages, social languages, specific types of verbal and\nnonverbal communication, etc.\nOrganized\/Intended Audience: This is a specific group of individuals who require more\nspecific language and information based on your topic. Maybe you are writing to a\ngroup of Economists who require technical\/professional dialogue and clearly defined\nareas of interest. Maybe you are writing to the local school board and need\ncomprehensive research on the policies and activities of the school district.\nTone and Style for Audience\nA key aspect of defining and writing to an audience is understanding how tone and\nstyle come into play. Style refers to syntactical elements such as sentence length,\nword choice, punctuation, etc. Whatever your overall purpose is in writing, your style\nshould reflect that in terms of persuading or informing. Tone refers to how your\naudience should feel once they receive your message. Think of writing an informal\nletter to your grandmother versus composing a professional email to your boss.\nImagine you are writing an email to one of your instructors. Which of the following\nexamples better utilizes tone and style?\n\u2022 Dear Professor Sanchez,\nI am having some trouble understanding today\u2019s assignment from class. Would\nyou mind if we scheduled a time to meet and discuss it during your office hours\nthis week?\n\u2022 Hey,\nI don\u2019t get what we\u2019re supposed to be doing in class? Help me please!\nDo you notice a stark difference between the two? In the first example, the student\npresents a clear and concise email with appropriate language and well-formed\nsentences. The style and tone match the intended audience and help to present a clear\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 49 purpose. In the second example, the student\u2019s purpose is unclear. The context they\npresent for needing help is vague, the tone is informal, and the request for help is too\ngeneral to affect a desired outcome.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 50 Conventions of Academic Writing\nOver the course of ENG 101, you will cultivate critical reading and writing skills that\ncontribute to a more meaningful connection with the texts you read and produce.\nThese skills are meant to be transferable, meaning the critical reading strategies,\ncognitive understandings, and effective communication skills you develop over the\ncourse of the semester will also apply to other coursework, majors, and professional\nskills. In and out of the classroom, you should be able to interpret rhetorical situations\nand audiences by breaking down a text to its usage of rhetorical strategies and the\noverall voice of the author. This rhetorical awareness includes competent syntax,\nstylistic choices, organization around a thesis, and various other components that\nmake up textual competency.\nA portion of these conventions do refer to the mechanical correctness of your writing,\nsuch as grammar, punctuation, and paragraphing, but just as important is your\ncomprehension of transferable rhetorical strategies.\nMechanical Academic Conventions\n\u2022 Use proper formatting and citation techniques as laid out in MLA Formatting\nBasics.\n\u2022 Avoid unsupported statements or making declarations with little to no evidence.\n\u2022 Use first-person (I, me, my, our) and second-person (you, your, yours) pronouns\nonly when necessary for clarity. In most cases, use third-person pronouns.\n\u2022 Avoid slang and colloquialisms.\n\u2022 Structure your writing so points are well organized and connect to one another.\nThe overall structure of a text is dictated mostly by genre, but your ideas should\nalways be clear and cohesive through your text\u2019s flow of information.\n\u2022 Use transitions and topic sentences between paragraphs to increase cohesion.\n\u2022 Make sure your diction (word choice) matches the style and tone of your writing\n(See Audience).\n\u2022 Make sure your verb tense (past, present, etc.) is always in agreement.\nIncorrect: During class, Alex stood up and walks out of the door in a huff.\nCorrect: During class, Alex stood up and walked out of the door in a huff.\n\u2022 Make sure your subjects and verbs are always in agreement.\nIncorrect: A class of writers were reading the textbook.\nCorrect: A class of writers was reading the textbook.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 51 (While \u201cwriters\u201d is plural, the noun in this sentence is actually the noun\nphrase \u201cclass of writers.\u201d There is just one class, so the singular verb\n\u201cwas\u201d is correct.)\n\u2022 Craft sentences that express complete thoughts.\nIncorrect: Speaking with an Appalachian dialect.\nCorrect: A person speaking with an Appalachian dialect is often\nstereotyped as lesser than: less smart, less educated, and less qualified.\n\u2022 When discussing what an author has written in an academic-style paper for\nmost disciplines, we refer to the quote or paraphrase in the present tense\nbecause we can, in this moment, read those words (even though the author\nwrote them in the past).\nIncorrect: As Constance Elam said in her 2002 article \u201cCulture,\nPoverty and Education in Appalachian Kentucky,\u201d support for public\neducation in Kentucky has historically been \u201cdelayed\u201d (10).\nCorrect: As Constance Elam says in her 2002 article \u201cCulture, Poverty and\nEducation in Appalachian Kentucky,\u201d support for public education in\nKentucky has historically been \u201cdelayed\u201d (10).\nRhetorical Academic Conventions\n\u2022 Maintain a comprehensive understanding of rhetorical situations and audience.\n\u2022 Present a clear purpose to your audience.\n\u2022 Support explanations with evidence.\n\u2022 Define and contextualize arguments through rhetorical functions and persuasive\nlanguage.\n\u2022 Critically analyze and evaluate texts beyond surface-level meanings.\n\u2022 Gain a deeper understanding of the rhetorical appeals (ethos, logos, and pathos)\nand their applicability to audience, purpose, etc.\nRhetoric Across Disciplines\nEnglish will not be the only discipline you engage with that demands rhetorical\ncompetency in understanding and creating texts. Regardless of your major or post-\ngraduate aspirations, you will carry critical thinking and reading skills into other\ndisciplines through the continuous need for textual comprehension.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 52 If you pursue social sciences, argumentation and evidence will take priority in political\nscience, sociology, psychology, etc. If you pursue marketing, economics, or business,\nrhetorical competency will take the form of persuasive speech that shapes agreements\nand uses language to provoke a specific response from your audience. Rhetoric can\neven take shape in scientific and mathematical disciplines in how various collections\nof languages and formulas dictate ways of thinking.\nA Note on Fair Use\nIn the same way this textbook is an example of various educational resources abiding\nby the language of fair use and copyright, you too should maintain a general\nunderstanding of these permissions. Fair use dictates the allowed usage of\ncopyrighted (or the rights to authorship) materials. You will be asked to quote the\nworks of many different authors for purposes of rhetorically analyzing and\nsynthesizing different ideas. Fair use gives you the right to utilize selected portions of\nthese works and fit them within larger conversations of your topics as long as you give\ncredit to the original author(s) and properly cite all materials. For more information\nabout fair use, see the EKU Library\u2019s Guide to Copyright and Fair Use.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 53 Purpose\nWhen you are asked to define your purpose in writing or to identify the purpose of a\ntext you are reading, you are trying to understand what the author\u2019s motivations are for\ncreating the text. What are your intentions with the text? Analyzing the purpose of a\ntext involves discerning what the author\u2019s rhetoric is being used for and deciding what\nthe author wants their audience to do with this information: Are they calling the\naudience to a specific action? Does the author wish for them to be better informed on a\ncertain topic? Are they engaging with or contributing to a larger conversation?\nYour purpose is only as limited as your intentions in a text. Various purposes for\nwriting a paper include to:\n\u2022 Inform\n\u2022 Persuade\n\u2022 Entertain\n\u2022 Analyze\n\u2022 Theorize\n\u2022 Explore\n\u2022 Question\nIn both reading and responding rhetorically to a text, interpreting the author\u2019s purpose\nmeans discerning an end goal (persuade, inform, etc.) and figuring out what evidence\nsupports that goal in terms of the text\u2019s central claim\/argument and what rhetorical\nappeals are used. In your own writing, you need to define your purpose through the\nclaims made in your thesis.\nPurpose and Thesis\nYour thesis acts as the roadmap to your paper, introducing and highlighting the main\nroutes your body paragraphs plan to take. In crafting a thesis, the clarity of your\npurpose as an author should coincide with the main ideas of the paper. The thesis\nstatement is usually presented near the beginning of the essay. A common practice in\nENG 101\/102 courses is to position your thesis statement near the end of your\nintroduction leading into your body paragraphs.\nThe thesis of an essay should encompass your main idea, the major point you are\ntrying to make. A thesis should present:\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 54 \u2022 A debatable claim your paper can build off of.\n\u2022 A brief introduction of the ideas and facts present in your body paragraphs.\n\u2022 Specific conclusions about your topic.\nYour thesis statement needs to make a clear and concise assertion about your topic\nand make some reference to the purpose and direction of your writing.\nGood Example of an Argumentative Thesis:\n\u201cAuthor X effectively convinces his audience that Beagles are the cutest dogs through\nthe use of relevant statistics and surveys paired with an emotional narrative.\u201d\nBad Example of an Argumentative Thesis:\n\u201cIn this paper, I will discuss why Author X\u2019s writing about dogs is good.\u201d\nIn the first example, an argumentative claim is made about the effectiveness of the\nauthor\u2019s rhetoric, and specific examples are introduced that outline the rest of the\npaper. The purpose is clear in that, after reading this concise statement, the audience\nis fully aware of the writer\u2019s intention to persuade their audience on why this author\u2019s\nrhetoric is so effective.\nIn the second example, the author references their intention (to discuss) but fails to\nacknowledge any debatable argument or relevant evidence for the body paragraphs of\nthe essay to build off of. By plainly stating, \u201cIn this paper, I will . . . \u201d the thesis comes\nacross more like a purpose statement with no actual claims.\nDefining Purpose\nWhen writing an essay and crafting a thesis, your purpose will usually be defined by\neither the parameters of the assignment or by your own intentions with the paper. If the\nassignment is to write a rhetorical analysis, your purpose will revolve around\npersuading your audience to engage with a certain point of view regarding the rhetoric\nof another author. If you are asked to write a literacy narrative, you will need a thesis\nthat informs your audience on the language and discourse communities of your chosen\ntopic. If you are writing a position synthesis paper, you will need an argumentative\nthesis that states the parameters of your position and works to persuade your\naudience in favor of your argument.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 55 Purpose and Audience\nAnother important factor in defining a purpose is understanding the specific audience\nyou are writing to. If your audience is a vague, general collection of readers, then your\npurpose will be equally vague. Your purpose should be shaped by the specific audience\nyou are writing to and the desired effect you wish to have on that audience. If your\npurpose is to persuade a specific audience, you must be aware of the sensibilities and\nvalues of that audience. Do they require significant context and background for your\ntopic? What evidence would work most effectively?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 56 Style\nStyle is how you choose to present your ideas; it\u2019s when the author considers audience\nand purpose in deciding how best to present information. It\u2019s the texture of your\nsentences and the words and phrases you choose to employ in your writing. Style is\njust as important as the actual content of your paper because the way you choose to\nshape and communicate your message plays an important role in its effectiveness.\nThe meaning of a text and the way it is presented both play a role in shaping your\nmessage, but style can also influence the way a reader interprets or generates meaning\nfrom a text based on other writing components. Elements such as tone, diction, and\nvoice either contribute to an author\u2019s style or work in tandem with it to make a work\nmore affecting on the reader.\n\u2022 Tone dictates your writing\u2019s overall attitude as it relates to audience and\npurpose. Take into consideration if your writing should be objective, logical,\nemotional, humorous, serious, formal, etc.\n\u2022 Diction is essentially word choice and vocabulary in a text. Your word choice\nshould be shaped by the type of text you are writing. Academic papers will\nusually necessitate formal language, while a casual speech may pair better with\ninformal diction.\n\u2022 Voice is just as important as tone and diction because it is what makes the\nwriting uniquely yours! Tone may change based on the circumstances of the\ntext, but voice, in terms of expression and individuality, should remain\nconsistent. Your work in English 101 should sound like you\u2014the really smart,\nwell-informed version of you.\nAll of these factors play a role in shaping one another, so when developing one of\nthem, consider its implications on the text holistically. In deciding your tone, you must\nalso consider the diction that contributes to your tone, the audience you are writing to,\nand how best to represent your voice.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 57 Example of tone:\nConsider you are writing to an academic audience to present your research findings.\nYou likely need a formal tone with informative reasoning that should be logical and\ncredible (logos and ethos).\n\u201cThrough extensive surveys and interviews, my findings indicate that chocolate is\ncategorically the best ice cream flavor.\u201d\nExample of diction:\nIf you are crafting a paper using a formal\/professional tone and style, your diction must\nfollow suit.\nFormal - \u201cProfessor Riley, may I have an extension on our current essay? I have\nunfortunately been overwhelmed with work and school recently.\u201d\nInformal - \u201cHey, I haven\u2019t done the paper. Can I turn it in next week?\u201d\nExample of voice:\nYour voice is also influenced by the word choice of your diction and the tone you\nchoose. Unique to voice, however, is the \u201cpersona\u201d you choose to bring to your writing.\n\u2022 Personal, cultural, and social language preferences can play a role in vocabulary\nand sentence fluency.\n\u2022 Authors who have influenced your writing style can shape your voice in how you\nchoose to emulate their style.\n\u2022 Topics, audiences, and purposes can all be a result of what personally interests\nyou as a writer.\nDeveloping Style\nNo one set style exists for composition that applies to every paper. Your writing style\nshould constantly be changing and adapting based on purpose, context, and audience.\nAs you mold your style to fit these different rhetorical situations, be aware of how your\ntone, diction, and voice should also change to fit within your chosen style. Consider\nthese tipis when developing style in your writing:\n1. Keep your writing clear and concise: Long-winded sentences tend to get in the\nway of developing a distinct style.\n2. Read different authors : You might not know what writing styles interest you\nuntil you engage with different ideas and how authors present them.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 58 3. Revise your writing: During the revision stage, look through specific elements\nlike diction and tone to discern if they all effectively contribute to your style.\n4. Read out loud: It might sound obvious, but reading your paper out loud and\nlistening to the flow of sentences in your paper can help you catch oddly worded\nphrases or uneven tones. It also enables you to create more conversational,\nnatural papers.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 59 MLA Formatting Basics\nThe Modern Language Association (MLA) is the style standard for all formatting\nrequirements in terms of in-text citations (parenthetical citations), and works cited\npages created for academic papers in most first-year writing and English studies\nprograms. Using MLA style guidelines for your formatting and page layouts creates\nuniformity and consistency in how you present information while also giving credit to\nthe ideas and quotes used from outside sources\u2014such as when you write about the\nreadings in this textbook. MLA Style primarily consists of general guidelines for how\nyour papers should be formatted and how information needs to be presented and\ncredited.\nFormatting\nThe basics of MLA formatting (for Microsoft Word and Google documents) include:\n1. Using 1-inch margins on the top, bottom, and both sides of the page.\n2. Indenting the start of each new paragraph by a half inch.\n3. Recommended use of Times New Roman 12-point-font.\n4. Double spacing every page.\n5. Listing your name, instructor\u2019s name, course number, and date in the upper left-\nhand corner of the first page.\n6.

Many of the readings found\nin this text represent aspects of Appalachian culture and issues ranging from\necological impact in the area to socioeconomic concerns to critical analyses of the\nnarratives and personalities that make up the culture. Many of the values of Appalachia\nare present here and the distinctive regional culture plays an important role in this text\nin focusing ideas and themes relevant to Appalachian culture\nAs first-year writing students, you will be asked to develop writing processes and\nreaderly habits that encourage the engagement of literacies and dialects that may be\nboth similar to or different from what you\u2019ve been used to. You will apply reading,\nwriting, and rhetorical skills to unique authorial perspectives that shine a light on\nissues and potential solutions within the region. If you are passionate about the\nAppalachian region or are coming to find a deeper appreciation for the culture, then the\nideas represented in these readings may help you focus on areas of importance while\ndeveloping critical thinking skills and readerly and writing habits.\nClassics\nClassic literature refers to any works that have consistently shaped the literature and\nideas of today or caused significant cultural or social changes in the world around us.\nThe term \u201cclassic\u201d is usually arbitrary in that it refers more to a category of widely\nrecognized works rather than a definitive set of texts every student must read.\nExposing ourselves to the classics benefits our reading comprehension and critical\nthinking skills by experiencing different writing styles, historical perspectives, and\nrhetorical qualities that help a work endure to this day. Applying our critical reading and\ncritical thinking skills to these texts also allows us to enter into an academic\nconversation that, in some cases, has persisted for centuries. When you are asked to\nrhetorically analyze a text like Jonathan Swift\u2019s \u201cA Modest Proposal,\u201d you are\ncontributing to a shared analysis that shapes how we understand the text in its own\nperiod as well as what social implications it has for us today. This is a text that has a\nwide body of knowledge attributed to its historical and rhetorical importance, and you\nare in a unique position to contribute to those conversations.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 66 Diversity\nIn developing your reading, writing, and rhetorical skills, it is important to actively\nengage with authors who reflect a growing diversity of experiences, ideas, and\nliteracies. Diversity of lived experiences in terms of race and ethnicity, language,\nsocioeconomic status, education, and a variety of other influencing factors make sure\nthe writing classroom represents a wide range of people. These distinctions allow\nstudents to connect their own experiences with readings and also develop a deeper\nunderstanding of others.\nIn Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric and across disciplines, diversity exists as a central\ntenet of academic inclusivity. The texts and ideas represented in this textbook are\nmeant to echo sentiments of evolving social perspectives that reflect the diversity of\nour students. The authors presented here represent diversity through specific language\nand dialect, theories of social change, historical perspectives of racial injustice,\nfeminist narratives, and a variety of other perspectives mirroring the day-to-day\nexperiences of you and your peers.\nEcology\nOf the many interdisciplinary issues within this text, an interest in environmental issues\nremains one of the most prevalent in contemporary society. Ecology is the study of\nhow populations of humans, plants, animals, and organisms interact. The purpose of\nengaging in readings focused on issues of environmental science is so we can better\nunderstand--on both a local and a global level--how our influence affects the\nsustainability of life.\nIn fitting these readings within the framework of Reading Writing, and Rhetoric, you will\nanalyze and interpret arguments and areas of environmental research that deal with\nneeds for environmental regulation on a global scale as well as at home in Appalachia.\nThe Appalachian-focused texts in this section address issues such as the negative\neffects of prolonged coal mining, the social and economic issues of mountaintop\nremoval, and narratives of long-standing environmental consciousness within the\nAppalachian community.\nGender\nIn this course, we will integrate varied sources to experience varied perspectives about\nimportant issues. To achieve this goal, we must seek out authors who reflect and\npromote issues of gender and sexuality in their writing. The impact of these issues\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 67 ranges from discussions of reinforced social roles in personal and professional lives to\nreferences of power structures and social norms associated with the lived experiences\nof men, women, and transgender individuals of different cultures. First-year writing\ndemands that we not just adapt to structures of academic writing but that we engage\nwith important ideas and genres that mirror the social hierarchies of our world Issues\nand themes of gender in this collection will hopefully represent an important body of\nperspectives. Our hope is that you apply your rhetorical and critical thinking skills to\nthe ideas of these texts to shape your own purpose in writing.\nHistory\nTo improve our reading, writing, and rhetorical habits, we must look to the past, both in\nterms of authors detailing important moments in world and U.S. history and authors\nactually writing in those time periods. Applying ideas from the past to our current\nwriting processes is such a broad concept that it includes everything from historical\naccounts of racial and gender inequality to the actual founding of the United States in\nthe Declaration of Independence. Applying these perspectives to our own writing\nprocesses helps us better understand how we fit into the world.\nFor the purposes of first-year writing, we can acknowledge the rhetorical strategies of\nauthors in the past and how they affected change so we can evolve in our own\nrhetorical understandings of the world today. Persuasive speech is something that has\nbeen around since the days of Aristotle, and critically evaluating how these rhetorical\nsituations have been adapted throughout history can help us apply rhetoric today and\npossibly see how or if it will change in the future.\nLiteracy\nThe ability to critically read, interpret, and generate meaning from a text directly relates\nto developing an efficient writing process and communicating meaningful ideas to an\naudience. Many of the authors featured in this text express the importance of\nunderstanding the relationship between reading and writing. The literacy skills\ndemonstrated in these readings offer important insight into how effective\ncommunication is the direct result of improved reading comprehension and meaningful\ntextual interaction.\nLiteracy is not something that only applies to the learning outcomes of this course. The\nquality of how you communicate and interpret information affects nearly every other\naspect of your academic and professional life. Disciplines that require any form of\nresearch or writing skills relate to the rhetorical competencies developed in this\ncourse. Professions that require information literacy such as finding, evaluating, and\ncommunicating information are developed in Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric. As you\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 68 read through these selections, consider the rhetorical approaches of the authors and\nthe literacies employed in navigating a variety of ideas.\nPolitics\nPolitical discourse contributes significantly to how we receive and create information\nin our everyday lives. The methods and conclusions we incorporate in our writing, both\npersonally and academically, are often a direct reflection of political views shaped from\nvarying social realities and world views. In engaging with texts from a variety of\npolitical interests, we receive a much deeper understanding of critical global trends as\nwell as our own roles in socioeconomic structures at local and national levels.\nEngaging with the text and speech of political figures and opinions develops necessary\nsocial literacies, which help us interpret meaning beyond surface-level words and even\ngain a greater understanding of purpose and audience.\nReading, Writing, and Rhetoric is not just an exercise in \u201ccorrect\u201d writing or\ngrammatical perfection but a way to understand and rhetorically respond to the world\naround us. Developing critical thinking skills and rhetorical awareness in terms of\npolitical discourse--broadly defined as any written or spoken communication--will\nbenefit your information literacy across disciplines of Sociology, Political Science,\nHistory, and many others that rely on competence in summarizing and responding to\ndifferent opinions.\nPop Culture\nPopular culture acts as a social vehicle through which we can ask philosophical and\nscholarly questions about how our culture functions and what we value. We\ncommunicate these ideas through fandoms, consumerism, media, and a host of other\ncommunal spaces, contributing to a certain era's social commentary. In addition, many\ncultural artifacts like books, artwork, film, and sports have the power to influence how\nwe think about the world.\nMany of these cultural frameworks and perspectives will contain socially relevant ideas\nthat can apply to areas of information literacy, critical thinking, argumentative analysis,\nand a host of other rhetorical applications. Important areas of critical studies can\nrelate to and engage with the television shows, movies, and cultural figures that\nactively define what our society values. Societal aspects of community engagement\nand individualism are born out of the pop culture we consume and engage with. It\nwould then make sense that we ask you to analyze and respond to texts which\nrepresent the cultural interests of the past and of today.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 69 Research\nPreparing and crafting research papers will be a much more central focus in ENG 102:\nResearch, Writing, and Rhetoric, but you should still be aware of how the compositional\nand rhetorical strategies developed in this class will translate into future research\nwork. Many of the authors presented in this text employ important research strategies\nwhich contribute to how persuasive they are, and strong academic readers and writers\nmust first be able to recognize those str. Critically analyzing the research processes of\ndifferent authors will help you interpret the credible and logical connections made\nbetween sources and to what effect those connections benefit the author\u2019s purpose. It\nalso helps to engage with a number of different research perspectives in\nunderstanding how many different areas of focus can be clearly presented through\ncarefully and clearly crafted evidence-based arguments.\nDeveloping a well-rounded research process will not only benefit you in this course but\nit will also translate to nearly every other discipline or major that requires competency\nin crafting arguments and persuasive language based on concise evidence. Most\nimportantly, developing skills in evaluating relevant information to engage with will\ntranslate to necessary professional skills required for communication-based jobs and\npursuits in the future.\nSociology\nA great deal of the readings housed in this text present themes of sociology and many\nsocial issues engrained in humanity. Sociology is the study of the make-up and\nstructure of human society. Many of these readings focus on social behaviors among\nspecific demographics and the social contexts making up the languages and\norganization of certain groups.\nSociology plays an important role in how you write and what you choose to write about.\nThe social and cultural influences present in your life contribute to how you organize\ninformation, formulate questions, and communicate ideas. Readings such as Cory\nDoctorow\u2019s \u201cWriting in the Age of Distraction\u201d and Jonathan Swift\u2019s \u201cA Modest\nProposal,\u201d thought different in scope and genre, both come from create places of\nsocial influences. For Doctorow, it is the connections found between technology and\nwriting processes. For Swift, it is a satirical response to social consequences of\npoverty by means of eating Irish children.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 70 Technology\nTechnological perspectives of reading and writing concepts go beyond baseline\nunderstandings of alphabetic literacy. Applying rhetorical concepts discussed in this\nclass to broader conversations of technological advancements, digital and social\nmedia literacy, and various fields of media and communication studies affords us\nopportunities to better understand how we can use these tools for persuasive language\nand the development of critical thinking skills. The technology referenced in these\nreadings varies from areas of digital literacy and social media writing to innovations in\nastronomy and environmental science.\nIn applying these vast concepts to areas of reading, writing, and rhetoric, you will learn\nhow to engage arguments and rhetorically analyze texts that represent areas of\ntechnological literacy necessary for personal and professional success. Each reading\noffers unique insight into how technology is used in tandem with language providing an\nopportunity for you to critically consider the authors\u2019 biases, assumptions, research\nmethodologies, and persuasiveness.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 71 Common Texts\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 72 Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\u2019s song \u201cCountdown\u201d from her 2011 album 4 was a massive success,\nand its accompanying video launched a massive controversy.

She also focuses heavily on bringing contemporary Nigerian culture\ninto mainstream consciousness as a reflection of her own desire to fight against\ndisempowering stereotypes in favor of diverse cultural opinions.\nIn \u201cThe Danger of a Single Story,\u201d Adichie articulates issues associated with only\ncommunicating one story or point of view of a group.

And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to\ncall \"the danger of the single story.\" I grew up on a university campus in eastern\nNigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is\nprobably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and\nAmerican children's books.\nI was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories\nin pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote\nexactly the kinds of stories I was reading: All my characters were white and blue-eyed,\nthey played in the snow, they ate apples, and they talked a lot about the weather, how\nlovely it was that the sun had come out.\nNow, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We\ndidn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, because\nthere was no need to.\nMy characters also drank a lot of ginger beer, because the characters in the British\nbooks I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.\nAnd for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer.\nBut that is another story.\nWhat this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the\nface of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which\ncharacters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to\nhave foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally\nidentify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of\nthem available, and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.\nBut because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental\nshift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the\ncolor of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in\nliterature. I started to write about things I recognized.\nNow, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination.\nThey opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 75 know that people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African\nwriters did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are.\nI come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family. My father was a professor.\nMy mother was an administrator. And so we had, as was the norm, live-in domestic\nhelp, who would often come from nearby rural villages. So, the year I turned eight, we\ngot a new house boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him\nwas that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes,\nto his family. And when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say, \"Finish your\nfood! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing.\" So I felt enormous pity\nfor Fide's family.\nThen one Saturday, we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a\nbeautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made. I was\nstartled. It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make\nsomething. All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that it had become\nimpossible for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single\nstory of them.\nYears later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United\nStates. I was 19. My American roommate was shocked by me. She asked where I had\nlearned to speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened\nto have English as its official language. She asked if she could listen to what she called\nmy \"tribal music,\" and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of\nMariah Carey.\nShe assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.\nWhat struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me. Her\ndefault position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity.\nMy roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single\nstory, there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility\nof feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals.\nI must say that before I went to the U.S., I didn't consciously identify as African. But in\nthe U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me. Never mind that I knew\nnothing about places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in\nmany ways I think of myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable when\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 76 Africa is referred to as a country, the most recent example being my otherwise\nwonderful flight from Lagos two days ago, in which there was an announcement on the\nVirgin flight about the charity work in \"India, Africa and other countries.\"\nSo, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my\nroommate's response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about\nAfrica were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful\nlandscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars,\ndying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a\nkind, white foreigner. I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen\nFide's family.\nThis single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature. Now, here\nis a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west\nAfrica in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage. After referring to the black\nAfricans as \"beasts who have no houses,\" he writes, \"They are also people without\nheads, having their mouth and eyes in their breasts.\"\nNow, I've laughed every time I've read this. And one must admire the imagination of\nJohn Lok. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of\na tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a\nplace of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the\nwonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are \"half devil, half child.\"\nAnd so, I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life\nseen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once\ntold me that my novel was not \"authentically African.\" Now, I was quite willing to\ncontend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a\nnumber of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something\ncalled African authenticity. In fact, I did not know what African authenticity was. The\nprofessor told me that my characters were too much like him, an educated and middle-\nclass man. My characters drove cars. They were not starving. Therefore they were not\nauthentically African.\nBut I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. A\nfew years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S. at the time\nwas tense, and there were debates going on about immigration. And, as often happens\nin America, immigration became synonymous with Mexicans. There were endless\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 77 stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system, sneaking\nacross the border, being arrested at the border, that sort of thing.\nI remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going\nto work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing. I remember first\nfeeling slight surprise. And then, I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had\nbeen so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing\nin my mind, the abject immigrant. I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I\ncould not have been more ashamed of myself.\nSo that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing,\nover and over again, and that is what they become.\nIt is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power. There is a\nword, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of\nthe world, and it is \"nkali.\" It's a noun that loosely translates to \"to be greater than\nanother.\" Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the\nprinciple of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many\nstories are told, are really dependent on power.\nPower is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the\ndefinitive story of that person. The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you\nwant to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start\nwith, \"secondly.\" Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with\nthe arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with\nthe failure of the African state, and not with the colonial creation of the African state,\nand you have an entirely different story.\nI recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that\nNigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him\nthat I had just read a novel called \"American Psycho\" ---- and that it was such a shame\nthat young Americans were serial murderers. Now, obviously I said this in a fit of mild\nirritation.\nBut it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in\nwhich a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all\nAmericans. This is not because I am a better person than that student, but because of\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 78 America's cultural and economic power, I had many stories of America. I had read Tyler\nand Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America.\nWhen I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy\nchildhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things\nmy parents had done to me.\nBut the truth is that I had a very happy childhood, full of laughter and love, in a very\nclose-knit family.\nBut I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps. My cousin Polle died because\nhe could not get adequate healthcare. One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a\nplane crash because our fire trucks did not have water. I grew up under repressive\nmilitary governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents were not\npaid their salaries. And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table,\nthen margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became\nrationed. And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives.\nAll of these stories make me who I am. But to insist on only these negative stories is to\nflatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me. The\nsingle story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are\nuntrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.\nOf course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes: There are immense ones, such as\nthe horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones, such as the fact that 5,000 people\napply for one job vacancy in Nigeria. But there are other stories that are not about\ncatastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.\nI've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without\nengaging with all of the stories of that place and that person. The consequence of the\nsingle story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal\nhumanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.\nSo what if before my Mexican trip, I had followed the immigration debate from both\nsides, the U.S. and the Mexican? What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was\npoor and hardworking? What if we had an African television network that broadcast\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 79 diverse African stories all over the world? What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls\n\"a balance of stories.\"\nWhat if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher, Muhtar Bakare, a remarkable\nman who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house? Now,\nthe conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature. He disagreed. He felt\nthat people who could read, would read, if you made literature affordable and available\nto them.\nShortly after he published my first novel, I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an\ninterview, and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said, \"I\nreally liked your novel. I didn't like the ending. Now, you must write a sequel, and this is\nwhat will happen ...\"\nAnd she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel. I was not only charmed, I was\nvery moved. Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were\nnot supposed to be readers. She had not only read the book, but she had taken\nownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.\nNow, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda, a fearless woman who\nhosts a TV show in Lagos, and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget?\nWhat if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos\nhospital last week? What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music,\ntalented people singing in English and Pidgin, and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo, mixing\ninfluences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.\nWhat if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in\nNigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's\nconsent before renewing their passports? What if my roommate knew about\nNollywood, full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds, films so\npopular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they\nproduce? What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who\nhas just started her own business selling hair extensions? Or about the millions of\nother Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse\nambition?\nEvery time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most\nNigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 80 resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it. I\nteach writing workshops in Lagos every summer, and it is amazing to me how many\npeople apply, how many people are eager to write, to tell stories.\nMy Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we\nhave big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and\nproviding books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries, and also of\norganizing lots and lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are\neager to tell our many stories.\nStories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to\nmalign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break\nthe dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.\nThe American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had\nmoved to the North. She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they\nhad left behind. \"They sat around, reading the book themselves, listening to me read\nthe book, and a kind of paradise was regained.\"\nI would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single story, when we\nrealize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.\nThank you.\nThe Danger of a Single Story by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International\nLicense.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 81 In this article, author Ana Baptista argues against burning trash through municipal\nwaste incinerators due to increased environmental risks in addition to the industry\ntargeting \u201cenvironmental justice communities\u201d as common locations for said\nincinerators. Despite public investment and support going towards the renewable\nenergy byproducts of these practices, many still believe the harmful pollutants expelled\nfrom incinerator plants and the negative impact they pose for low-income and minority\nbased communities necessitate alternative waste management.

Waste Incineration in 5 Charts\nAna Baptista\n\"Wheelabrator Technologies' Waste-to-Energy plant in Saugus, Massachusetts.\" by\nFletcher6 is licensed under CC BY 3.0\nBurning trash has a long history in the United States, and municipal solid waste\nincinerators have sparked resistance in many places. As an environmental justice\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 82 scholar who works directly with low-income and communities of color, I see\nincineration as a poor waste management option.\nAlthough these plants generate electricity from the heat created by burning trash, their\nprimary purpose is waste disposal. Emissions from burning waste worsen\nenvironmental inequalities, create financial risks for host communities and reduce\nincentives to adopt more sustainable waste practices.\nI recently co-authored a report that describes signs of decline in the U.S. waste\nincineration industry due to many factors. They include a volatile revenue model, aging\nplants, high operation and maintenance costs, and growing public interest in reducing\nwaste, promoting environmental justice and combating climate change.\nNonetheless, 72 incinerators are still operating today in the U.S. Most of them \u2013 58, or\n80% \u2013 are sited in environmental justice communities, which we defined as areas\nwhere more than 25% of residents are low-income, people of color or both. Incinerators\nworsen cumulative impacts from multiple pollution sources on these overburdened\nneighborhoods.\nEnvironmental justice flashpoints\nWaste incinerators are heavily concentrated in northeast states and Florida \u2013 areas\nwith high population densities and limited landfill space. Some of these states also\nprovide favorable economic incentives, such as allowing incinerators to earn\nrenewable energy credits for generating electricity.\nIn the past year environmental justice advocates have successfully shut down\nincinerators in Detroit, Michigan, and Commerce, California. The Detroit incinerator\nwas built in the 1980s and received more than US$1 billion in public investment borne\nby local taxpayers. Groups such as Breathe Free Detroit and Zero Waste Detroit rallied\nresidents to oppose the public financing and health burdens that the facility imposed\non surrounding environmental justice communities. The plant closed in March 2019.\nThe California plant closed in June 2018 after a yearlong campaign by two community-\nbased organizations, East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice and Valley\nImprovement Projects, to prevent incineration from qualifying for state renewable\nenergy subsidies. The facility ultimately closed when a 30-year power purchase\nagreement with the local utility expired, leaving it without a sufficient revenue stream.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 83 Aging facilities\nIncineration plants\u2019 average life expectancy is 30 years. Three-quarters of operating\nwaste incinerators in the United States are at least 25 years old.\nThese facilities\u2019 revenues come primarily from tipping fees that waste haulers pay to\ndump trash, and secondarily from generating electricity. These revenue streams are\nvolatile and can undermine the industry\u2019s financial stability. At least 31 incinerators\nhave closed since 2000 due to issues such as insufficient revenue or inability to afford\nrequired upgrades.\nOperations and maintenance costs typically increase as plants age and their\nperformance decreases. Upgrades, such as installing new pollution control equipment,\ncan cost tens of millions of dollars, and sometimes more than US$100 million.\nThese large capital expenditures represent risks for host communities, which often\nprovide public financing through bonds or tax increases. Such measures are risky\nbecause the waste service and energy contracts that generate revenue are increasingly\nshorter term and vulnerable to fluctuating market and regulatory conditions. As plants\nage, their environmental performance may also degrade over time, posing increasing\nrisks to the environment and public health.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 84 What incinerators burn\nThe composition of municipal solid waste has changed over the past 50 years.\nSynthetic materials such as plastics have increased, while biogenic, compostable\nmaterials such as paper and yard trimmings have decreased.\nPlastics are particularly problematic for waste handling because they are petroleum-\nbased, nonbiogenic materials. They are difficult to decompose and release harmful\npollutants such as dioxins and heavy metals when they are incinerated.\nWaste management trends\nToday, thanks to the evolution of waste handling options, a majority of the materials in\nmunicipal solid waste can be composted or recycled. This reduces impacts on the\nenvironment, including air, soil and water contamination and greenhouse gas\nemissions. As cities like New York and San Francisco adopt zero-waste policies that\ncreate incentives for diverting waste from landfills or incinerators, burning trash will\nincreasingly become obsolete.\nMany U.S. cities and states are adopting aggressive climate change and sustainability\ngoals. Waste reduction and diversion will play a critical part in meeting these targets.\nThe public is increasingly demanding more upstream solutions in the form of extended\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 85 producer responsibility bills, plastic bans and less-toxic product redesign. There is also\na growing movement for less-consumptive lifestyles that favors zero-waste goals.\nHeavy polluters\nIncinerators release many air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides,\nparticulate matter, lead, mercury, dioxins and furans. These substances are known to\nhave serious public health effects, from increased cancer risk to respiratory illness,\ncardiac disease and reproductive, developmental and neurological problems.\nAccording to recent figures from the waste industry, incinerator plants emit more\nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide per unit of electricity generated than\npower plants burning natural gas.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 86 Research on direct health impacts of waste incineration in the United States is limited,\nbut a handful of studies from Asia and Europe, where waste incinerators are prevalent,\noffer some insights. For example, a 2013 study in Italy analyzed the occurrence of\nmiscarriages in women aged 15-49 years residing near seven incinerators in northern\nItaly\u2019s Emilia-Romagna region, and found that increased particulate emissions from the\nincinerators was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.\nA single incinerator may burn anywhere from a few hundred tons to several thousand\ntons of waste per day. Smaller incinerators typically have lower absolute emissions but\ncan emit more hazardous pollutants for each ton of waste they burn. Plant emissions\nalso can vary widely based on the heterogeneous composition of municipal waste, the\nage and type of emissions control equipment, and how well the plant is operated and\nmaintained over time.\nIs Burning Trash a Good Way to Handle It by Ana Baptista is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 87 Mike Bunn is a historian who has a passion for reading and writing. In his article\nentitled \u201cHow to Read Like a Writer,\u201d he advocates for \u201cReading like a Writer\u201d (or RLW).\nThis is a form of active reading, where the student asks questions about author intent\nwhile engaging in the content of the work. When reading, Bunn says students should be\nquestioning how the author has affected the reader. What has the author done to\nimpact you? How have they done this? Why are you affected? Annotating for these\nquestions, as well as underlining key passages\/ phrases and noting reactions to the\ntext can help keep the student engaged, as well as keep a record of thoughts for any\nfuture writing done about the piece.\nBunn\u2019s RLW practice allows for students to improve their own writing through the\nquestion \u201cWould I want to try this in my own writing?\u201d. This type of active reading lends\nitself heavily to inspiration. The student will become inspired by how an author goes\nabout explaining a particular concept, or giving a certain description, or describing a\ncertain place, and will want to try it out for themselves. Students may be hesitant to try\nout these new approaches to writing, as they may feel as though they are simply\ncopying what the author has achieved. Bunn thinks otherwise. He understands that\n\u201cwriting is a series of choices\u201d, and in trying out inspiration from another author, you\nare likely to make slightly different choices, thus making the idea your own.\nIntroduction by Ashton Conley\n#literacy #research\nHow to Read Like a Writer\nMike Bunn\nIn 1997, I was a recent college graduate living in London for six months and working at\nthe Palace Theatre owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The Palace was a beautiful red\nbrick, four-story theatre in the heart of London\u2019s famous West End, and eight times a\nweek it housed a three-hour performance of the musical Les Miserables. Because of\nantiquated fire-safety laws, every theatre in the city was required to have a certain\nnumber of staff members inside watching the performance in case of an emergency.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 88 My job (in addition to wearing a red tuxedo jacket) was to sit inside the dark theater\nwith the patrons and make sure nothing went wrong. It didn\u2019t seem to matter to my\nsupervisor that I had no training in security and no idea where we kept the fire\nextinguishers. I was pretty sure that if there was any trouble I\u2019d be running down the\nback stairs, leaving the patrons to fend for themselves. I had no intention of dying in a\nbright red tuxedo.\nThere was a Red Coat stationed on each of the theater\u2019s four floors, and we all passed\nthe time by sitting quietly in the back, reading books with tiny flashlights. It\u2019s not easy\ntrying to read in the dim light of a theatre\u2014flashlight or no flashlight\u2014and it\u2019s even\ntougher with shrieks and shouts and gunshots coming from the stage. I had to focus\nintently on each and every word, often rereading a single sentence several times.\nSometimes I got distracted and had to re-read entire paragraphs. As I struggled to read\nin this environment, I began to realize that the way I was reading\u2014one word at a time\u2014\nwas exactly the same way that the author had written the text. I realized writing is a\nword-by-word, sentence-by-sentence process. The intense concentration required to\nread in the theater helped me recognize some of the interesting ways that authors\nstring words into phrases into paragraphs into entire books.\nI came to realize that all writing consists of a series of choices.\nI was an English major in college, but I don\u2019t think I ever thought much about reading. I\nread all the time. I read for my classes and on the computer and sometimes for fun, but\nI never really thought about the important connections between reading and writing,\nand how reading in a particular way could also make me a better writer.\nWhat Does It Mean to Read Like a Writer\nWhen you Read Like a Writer (RLW) you work to identify some of the choices the author\nmade so that you can better understand how such choices might arise in your own\nwriting. The idea is to carefully examine the things you read, looking at the writerly\ntechniques in the text in order to decide if you might want to adopt similar (or the\nsame) techniques in your writing.\nYou are reading to learn about writing.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 89 Instead of reading for content or to better understand the ideas in the writing (which\nyou will automatically do to some degree anyway), you are trying to understand how\nthe piece of writing was put together by the author and what you can learn about\nwriting by reading a particular text. As you read in this way, you think about how the\nchoices the author made and the techniques that he\/she used are influencing your own\nresponses as a reader. What is it about the way this text is written that makes you feel\nand respond the way you do?\nThe goal as you read like a writer is to locate what you believe are the most important\nwriterly choices represented in the text\u2014choices as large as the overall structure or as\nsmall as a single word used only once\u2014to consider the effect of those choices on\npotential readers (including yourself). Then you can go one step further and imagine\nwhat different choices the author might have made instead, and what effect those\ndifferent choices would have on readers.\nSay you\u2019re reading an essay in class that begins with a short quote from President\nBarack Obama about the war in Iraq. As a writer, what do you think of this technique?\nDo you think it is effective to begin the essay with a quote? What if the essay began\nwith a quote from someone else? What if it was a much longer quote from President\nObama, or a quote from the President about something other than the war?\nAnd here is where we get to the most important part: Would you want to try this\ntechnique in your own writing?\nWould you want to start your own essay with a quote? Do you think it would be\neffective to begin your essay with a quote from President Obama? What about a quote\nfrom someone else? You could make yourself a list. What are the advantages and\ndisadvantages of starting with a quote? What about the advantages and disadvantages\nof starting with a quote from the President? How would other readers respond to this\ntechnique? Would certain readers (say Democrats or liberals) appreciate an essay that\nstarted with a quote from President Obama better than other readers (say Republicans\nor conservatives)? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of starting with a\nquote from a less divisive person? What about starting with a quote from someone\nmore divisive?\nThe goal is to carefully consider the choices the author made and the techniques that\nhe or she used, and then decide whether you want to make those same choices or use\nthose same techniques in your own writing. Author and professor Wendy Bishop\nexplains how her reading process changed when she began to read like a writer:\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 90 It wasn\u2019t until I claimed the sentence as my area of desire, interest, and\nexpertise\u2014until I wanted to be a writer writing better\u2014that I had to look\nunderneath my initial readings . . . I started asking, how\u2014how did the writer get\nme to feel, how did the writer say something so that it remains in my memory\nwhen many other things too easily fall out, how did the writer communicate\nhis\/her intentions about genre, about irony? (119\u2013 20)\nBishop moved from simply reporting her personal reactions to the things she read to\nattempting to uncover how the author led her (and other readers) to have those\nreactions. This effort to uncover how authors build texts is what makes Reading Like a\nWriter so useful for student writers.\nHow Is RLW Different from \u201cNormal\u201d Reading\nMost of the time we read for information. We read a recipe to learn how to bake\nlasagna. We read the sports page to see if our school won the game, Facebook to see\nwho has commented on our status update, a history book to learn about the Vietnam\nWar, and the syllabus to see when the next writing assignment is due. Reading Like a\nWriter asks for something very different.\nIn 1940, a famous poet and critic named Allen Tate discussed two different ways of\nreading:\nThere are many ways to read, but generally speaking there are two ways. They\ncorrespond to the two ways in which we may be interested in a piece of\narchitecture. If the building has Corinthian columns, we can trace the origin and\ndevelopment of Corinthian columns; we are interested as historians. But if we\nare interested as architects, we may or may not know about the history of the\nCorinthian style; we must, however, know all about the construction of the\nbuilding, down to the last nail or peg in the beams. We have got to know this if\nwe are going to put up buildings ourselves. (506)\nWhile I don\u2019t know anything about Corinthian columns (and doubt that I will ever\nwant to know anything about Corinthian columns), Allen Tate\u2019s metaphor of\nreading as if you were an architect is a great way to think about RLW. When you\nread like a writer, you are trying to figure out how the text you are reading was\nconstructed so that you learn how to \u201cbuild\u201d one for yourself. Author David\nJauss makes a similar comparison when he writes that \u201creading won\u2019t help you\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 91 much unless you learn to read like a writer. You must look at a book the way a\ncarpenter looks at a house someone else built, examining the details in order to\nsee how it was made\u201d (64).\nPerhaps I should change the name and call this Reading Like an Architect, or Reading\nLike a Carpenter. In a way those names make perfect sense. You are reading to see\nhow something was constructed so that you can construct something similar yourself.\nWhy Learn to Read Like a Writer\nFor most college students RLW is a new way to read, and it can be difficult to learn at\nfirst. Making things even more difficult is that your college writing instructor may\nexpect you to read this way for class but never actually teach you how to do it. He or\nshe may not even tell you that you\u2019re supposed to read this way. This is because most\nwriting instructors are so focused on teaching writing that they forget to show students\nhow they want them to read.\nThat\u2019s what this essay is for.\nIn addition to the fact that your college writing instructor may expect you to read like a\nwriter, this kind of reading is also one of the very best ways to learn how to write well.\nReading like a writer can help you understand how the process of writing is a series of\nmaking choices, and in doing so, can help you recognize important decisions you might\nface and techniques you might want to use when working on your own writing. Reading\nthis way becomes an opportunity to think and learn about writing.\nCharles Moran, a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, urges us to\nread like writers because:\nWhen we read like writers we understand and participate in the writing. We see the\nchoices the writer has made, and we see how the writer has coped with the\nconsequences of those choices . . . We \u201csee\u201d what the writer is doing because we read\nas writers; we see because we have written ourselves and know the territory, know the\nfeel of it, know some of the moves ourselves. (61)\nYou are already an author, and that means you have a built-in advantage when reading\nlike a writer. All of your previous writing experiences\u2014inside the classroom and out\u2014\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 92 can contribute to your success with RLW. Because you \u201chave written\u201d things yourself,\njust as Moran suggests, you are better able to \u201csee\u201d the choices that the author is\nmaking in the texts that you read. This in turn helps you to think about whether you\nwant to make some of those same choices in your own writing, and what the\nconsequences might be for your readers if you do.\nWhat Are Some Questions to Ask Before You Start Reading\nAs I sat down to work on this essay, I contacted a few of my former students to ask\nwhat advice they would give to college students regarding how to read effectively in\nthe writing classroom and also to get their thoughts on RLW. Throughout the rest of\nthe essay I\u2019d like to share some of their insights and suggestions; after all, who is\nbetter qualified to help you learn what you need to know about reading in college\nwriting courses than students who recently took those courses themselves?\nOne of the things that several students mentioned to do first, before you even start\nreading, is to consider the context surrounding both the assignment and the text you\u2019re\nreading. As one former student, Alison, states: \u201cThe reading I did in college asked me\nto go above and beyond, not only in breadth of subject matter, but in depth, with\nregards to informed analysis and background information on context.\u201d Alison was\nasked to think about some of the factors that went into the creation of the text, as well\nas some of the factors influencing her own experience of reading\u2014taken together\nthese constitute the context of reading. Another former student, Jamie, suggests that\nstudents \u201clearn about the historical context of the writings\u201d they will read for class.\nWriting professor Richard Straub puts it this way: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to just read a text.\nYou\u2019re going to read a text within a certain context, a set of circumstances . . . It\u2019s one\nkind of writing or another, designed for one audience and purpose or another\u201d (138).\nAmong the contextual factors you\u2019ll want to consider before you even start reading are:\n\u2022 Do you know the author\u2019s purpose for this piece of writing?\n\u2022 Do you know who the intended audience is for this piece of writing?\nIt may be that you need to start reading before you can answer these first two\nquestions, but it\u2019s worth trying to answer them before you start. For example, if you\nknow at the outset that the author is trying to reach a very specific group of readers,\nthen his or her writerly techniques may seem more or less effective than if he\/she was\ntrying to reach a more general audience. Similarly\u2014returning to our earlier example of\nbeginning an essay with a quote from President Obama about the war in Iraq\u2014if you\nknow that the author\u2019s purpose is to address some of the dangers and drawbacks of\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 93 warfare, this may be a very effective opening. If the purpose is to encourage Americans\nto wear sunscreen while at the beach this opening makes no sense at all. One former\nstudent, Lola, explained that most of her reading assignments in college writing\nclasses were designed \u201cto provoke analysis and criticisms into the style, structure, and\npurpose of the writing itself.\u201d\nIn What Genre Is This Written\nAnother important thing to consider before reading is the genre of the text. Genre\nmeans a few different things in college English classes, but it\u2019s most often used to\nindicate the type of writing: a poem, a newspaper article, an essay, a short story, a\nnovel, a legal brief, an instruction manual, etc. Because the conventions for each genre\ncan be very different (who ever heard of a 900-page newspaper article?), techniques\nthat are effective for one genre may not work well in another. Many readers expect\npoems and pop songs to rhyme, for example, but might react negatively to a legal brief\nor instruction manual that did so. Another former student, Mike, comments on how\nimportant the genre of the text can be for reading:\nI think a lot of the way I read, of course, depends on the type of text I\u2019m reading. If I\u2019m\nreading philosophy, I always look for signaling words (however, therefore, furthermore,\ndespite) indicating the direction of the argument . . . when I read fiction or creative\nnonfiction, I look for how the author inserts dialogue or character sketches within\nnarration or environmental observation. After reading To the Lighthouse [sic] last\nsemester, I have noticed how much more attentive I\u2019ve become to the types of\nnarration (omniscient, impersonal, psychological, realistic, etc.), and how these\ndifferent approaches are utilized to achieve an author\u2019s overall effect.\nAlthough Mike specifically mentions what he looked for while reading a published\nnovel, one of the great things about RLW is that it can be used equally well with either\npublished or student-produced writing.\nIs This a Published or a Student-Produced Piece of Writing?\nAs you read both kinds of texts you can locate the choices the author made and\nimagine the different decisions that he\/she might have made. While it might seem a\nlittle weird at first to imagine how published texts could be written differently\u2014after all,\nthey were good enough to be published\u2014remember that all writing can be improved.\nScholar Nancy Walker believes that it\u2019s important for students to read published work\nusing RLW because \u201cthe work ceases to be a mere artifact, a stone tablet, and\nbecomes instead a living utterance with immediacy and texture. It could have been\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 94 better or worse than it is had the author made different choices\u201d (36). As Walker\nsuggests, it\u2019s worth thinking about how the published text would be different\u2014maybe\neven better\u2014if the author had made different choices in the writing because you may\nbe faced with similar choices in your own work.\nIs This the Kind of Writing You Will Be Assigned to Write Yourself\nKnowing ahead of time what kind of writing assignments you will be asked to complete\ncan really help you to read like a writer. It\u2019s probably impossible (and definitely too time\nconsuming) to identify all of the choices the author made and all techniques an author\nused, so it\u2019s important to prioritize while reading. Knowing what you\u2019ll be writing\nyourself can help you prioritize. It may be the case that your instructor has assigned\nthe text you\u2019re reading to serve as model for the kind of writing you\u2019ll be doing later.\nJessie, a former student, writes, \u201cIn college writing classes, we knew we were reading\nfor a purpose\u2014to influence or inspire our own work. The reading that I have done in\ncollege writing courses has always been really specific to a certain type of writing, and\nit allows me to focus and experiment on that specific style in depth and without\ndistraction.\u201d\nIf the text you\u2019re reading is a model of a particular style of writing\u2014for example, highly-\nemotional or humorous\u2014RLW is particularly helpful because you can look at a piece\nyou\u2019re reading and think about whether you want to adopt a similar style in your own\nwriting. You might realize that the author is trying to arouse sympathy in readers and\nexamine what techniques he\/she uses to do this; then you can decide whether these\ntechniques might work well in your own writing. You might notice that the author keeps\nincluding jokes or funny stories and think about whether you want to include them in\nyour writing\u2014what would the impact be on your potential readers?\nWhat Are Questions to Ask As You Are Reading\nIt is helpful to continue to ask yourself questions as you read like a writer. As you\u2019re\nfirst learning to read in this new way, you may want to have a set of questions written\nor typed out in front of you that you can refer to while reading. Eventually\u2014after plenty\nof practice\u2014you will start to ask certain questions and locate certain things in the text\nalmost automatically. Remember, for most students this is a new way of reading, and\nyou\u2019ll have to train yourself to do it well. Also keep in mind that you\u2019re reading to\nunderstand how the text was written\u2014how the house was built\u2014more than you\u2019re trying\nto determine the meaning of the things you read or assess whether the texts are good\nor bad.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 95 First, return to two of the same questions I suggested that you consider before reading:\n\u2022 What is the author\u2019s purpose for this piece of writing?\n\u2022 Who is the intended audience?\nThink about these two questions again as you read. It may be that you couldn\u2019t really\nanswer them before, or that your ideas will change while reading. Knowing why the\npiece was written and who it\u2019s for can help explain why the author might have made\ncertain choices or used particular techniques in the writing, and you can assess those\nchoices and techniques based in part on how effective they are in fulfilling that\npurpose and\/or reaching the intended audience.\nBeyond these initial two questions, there is an almost endless list of questions you\nmight ask regarding writing choices and techniques. Here are some of the questions\nthat one former student, Clare, asks herself:\nWhen reading I tend to be asking myself a million questions. If I were writing this,\nwhere would I go with the story? If the author goes in a different direction (as they so\noften do) from what I am thinking, I will ask myself, why did they do this? What are they\ntelling me?\nClare tries to figure out why the author might have made a move in the writing that she\nhadn\u2019t anticipated, but even more importantly, she asks herself what she would do if\nshe were the author. Reading the text becomes an opportunity for Clare to think about\nher own role as an author.\nHere are some additional examples of the kinds of questions you might ask yourself as\nyou read:\n\u2022 How effective is the language the author uses? Is it too formal? Too informal?\nPerfectly appropriate?\nDepending on the subject matter and the intended audience, it may make sense to be\nmore or less formal in terms of language. As you begin reading, you can ask yourself\nwhether the word choice and tone\/ language of the writing seem appropriate.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 96 What kinds of evidence does the author use to support his\/her claims? Does he\/ she\nuse statistics? Quotes from famous people? Personal anecdotes or personal stories?\nDoes he\/she cite books or articles?\n\u2022 How appropriate or effective is this evidence? Would a different type of\nevidence, or some combination of evidence, be more effective?\nTo some extent the kinds of questions you ask should be determined by the genre of\nwriting you are reading. For example, it\u2019s probably worth examining the evidence that\nthe author uses to support his\/ her claims if you\u2019re reading an opinion column, but less\nimportant if you\u2019re reading a short story. An opinion column is often intended to\nconvince readers of something, so the kinds of evidence used are often very important.\nA short story may be intended to convince readers of something, sometimes, but\nprobably not in the same way. A short story rarely includes claims or evidence in the\nway that we usually think about them.\n\u2022 Are there places in the writing that you find confusing? What about the writing in\nthose places makes it unclear or confusing?\nIt\u2019s pretty normal to get confused in places while reading, especially while reading for\nclass, so it can be helpful to look closely at the writing to try and get a sense of exactly\nwhat tripped you up. This way you can learn to avoid those same problems in your own\nwriting.\n\u2022 How does the author move from one idea to another in the writing? Are the\ntransitions between the ideas effective? How else might he\/she have\ntransitioned between ideas instead?\nNotice that in these questions I am encouraging you to question whether aspects of\nthe writing are appropriate and effective in addition to deciding whether you liked or\ndisliked them. You want to imagine how other readers might respond to the writing and\nthe techniques you\u2019ve identified. Deciding whether you liked or disliked something is\nonly about you; considering whether a technique is appropriate or effective lets you\ncontemplate what the author might have been trying to do and to decide whether a\nmajority of readers would find the move successful. This is important because it\u2019s the\nsame thing you should be thinking about while you are writing: how will readers\nrespond to this technique I am using, to this sentence, to this word? As you read, ask\nyourself what the author is doing at each step of the way, and then consider whether\nthe same choice or technique might work in your own writing.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 97 What Should You Be Writing As You Are Reading\nThe most common suggestion made by former students\u2014mentioned by every single\none of them\u2014was to mark up the text, make comments in the margins, and write\nyourself notes and summaries both during and after reading. Often the notes students\ntook while reading became ideas or material for the students to use in their own\npapers. It\u2019s important to read with a pen or highlighter in your hand so that you can\nmark\u2014right on the text\u2014all those spots where you identify an interesting choice the\nauthor has made or a writerly technique you might want to use. One thing that I like to\ndo is to highlight and underline the passage in the text itself, and then try to answer the\nfollowing three questions on my notepad:\n\u2022 What is the technique the author is using here?\n\u2022 Is this technique effective?\n\u2022 What would be the advantages and disadvantages if I tried this same technique\nin my writing?\nBy utilizing this same process of highlighting and note taking, you\u2019ll end up with a\nuseful list of specific techniques to have at your disposal when it comes time to begin\nyour own writing.\nWhat Does RLW Look Like in Action\nLet\u2019s go back to the opening paragraph of this essay and spend some time reading like\nwriters as a way to get more comfortable with the process:\nIn 1997, I was a recent college graduate living in London for six months and working at\nthe Palace Theatre owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The Palace was a beautiful red\nbrick, four-story theatre in the heart of London\u2019s famous West End, and eight times a\nweek it housed a three-hour performance of the musical Les Miserables. Because of\nantiquated fire-safety laws, every theatre in the city was required to have a certain\nnumber of staff members inside watching the performance in case of an emergency.\nLet\u2019s begin with those questions I encouraged you to try to answer before you start\nreading. (I realize we\u2019re cheating a little bit in this case since you\u2019ve already read most\nof this essay, but this is just practice. When doing this on your own, you should attempt\nto answer these questions before reading, and then return to them as you read to\nfurther develop your answers.)\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 98 \u2022 Do you know the author\u2019s purpose for this piece of writing? I hope the purpose is\nclear by now; if it isn\u2019t, I\u2019m doing a pretty lousy job of explaining how and why\nyou might read like a writer.\n\u2022 Do you know who the intended audience is? Again, I hope that you know this one\nby now.\n\u2022 What about the genre? Is this an essay? An article? What would you call it?\n\u2022 You know that it\u2019s published and not student writing. How does this influence\nyour expectations for what you will read?\n\u2022 Are you going to be asked to write something like this yourself? Probably not in\nyour college writing class, but you can still use RLW to learn about writerly\ntechniques that you might want to use in whatever you do end up writing.\nNow ask yourself questions as you read.\nIn 1997, I was a recent college graduate living in London for six months and working at\nthe Palace Theatre owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The Palace was a beautiful red\nbrick, four-story theatre in the heart of London\u2019s famous West End, and eight times a\nweek it housed a three-hour performance of the musical Les Miserables. Because of\nantiquated fire-safety laws, every theatre in the city was required to have a certain\nnumber of staff members inside watching the performance in case of an emergency.\nSince this paragraph is the very first one, it makes sense to think about how it\nintroduces readers to the essay. What technique(s) does the author use to begin the\ntext? This is a personal story about his time working in London. What else do you\nnotice as you read over this passage? Is the passage vague or specific about where he\nworked? You know that the author worked in a famous part of London in a beautiful\ntheater owned by a well-known composer. Are these details important? How different\nwould this opening be if instead I had written:\nThis is certainly shorter, and some of you may prefer this version. It\u2019s quick. To the\npoint. But what (if anything) is lost by eliminating so much of the detail? I chose to\ninclude each of the details that the revised sentence omits, so it\u2019s worth considering\nwhy. Why did I mention where the theater was located? Why did I explain that I was\nliving in London right after finishing college? Does it matter that it was after college?\nWhat effect might I have hoped the inclusion of these details would have on readers? Is\nthis reference to college an attempt to connect with my audience of college students?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 99 Am I trying to establish my credibility as an author by announcing that I went to\ncollege?\nWhy might I want the readers to know that this was a theater owned by Andrew Lloyd\nWeber? Do you think I am just trying to mention a famous name that readers will\nrecognize? Will Andrew Lloyd Weber figure prominently in the rest of the essay?\nThese are all reasonable questions to ask. They are not necessarily the right questions\nto ask because there are no right questions. They certainly aren\u2019t the only questions\nyou could ask, either. The goal is to train yourself to formulate questions as you read\nbased on whatever you notice in the text. Your own reactions to what you\u2019re reading\nwill help determine the kinds of questions to ask.\nNow take a broader perspective. I begin this essay\u2014an essay about reading\u2014by talking\nabout my job in a theater in London. Why? Doesn\u2019t this seem like an odd way to begin\nan essay about reading? If you read on a little further (feel free to scan back up at the\ntop of this essay) you learn in the third full paragraph what the connection is between\nworking in the theater and reading like a writer, but why include this information at all?\nWhat does this story add to the essay? Is it worth the space it takes up?\nThink about what effect presenting this personal information might have on readers.\nDoes it make it feel like a real person, some \u201cordinary guy,\u201d is talking to you? Does it\ndraw you into the essay and make you want to keep reading?\nWhat about the language I use? Is it formal or more informal? This is a time when you\ncan really narrow your focus and look at particular words:\nBecause of antiquated fire-safety laws, every theatre in the city was required to have a\ncertain number of staff members inside watching the performance in case of an\nemergency.\nWhat is the effect of using the word \u201cantiquated\u201d to describe the fire safety laws? It\ncertainly projects a negative impression; if the laws are described as antiquated it\nmeans I view them as old-fashioned or obsolete. This is a fairly uncommon word, so it\nstands out, drawing attention to my choice in using it. The word also sounds quite\nformal. Am I formal in the rest of this sentence?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 100 I use the word \u201cperformance\u201d when I just as easily could have written \u201cshow.\u201d For that\nmatter, I could have written \u201cold\u201d instead of \u201cantiquated.\u201d You can proceed like this\nthroughout the sentence, thinking about alternative choices I could have made and\nwhat the effect would be. Instead of \u201cstaff members\u201d I could have written \u201cemployees\u201d\nor just \u201cworkers.\u201d Notice the difference if the sentence had been written:\nBecause of old fire-safety laws, every theatre in the city was required to have a certain\nnumber of workers inside watching the show in case of an emergency.\nWhich version is more likely to appeal to readers? You can try to answer this question\nby thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of using formal language. When\nwould you want to use formal language in your writing and when would it make more\nsense to be more conversational?\nAs you can see from discussing just this one paragraph, you could ask questions about\nthe text forever. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to. As you continue reading like a writer, you\u2019ll\nlearn to notice techniques that seem new and pay less attention to the ones you\u2019ve\nthought about before. The more you practice the quicker the process becomes until\nyou\u2019re reading like a writer almost automatically.\nI want to end this essay by sharing one more set of comments by my former student,\nLola, this time about what it means to her to read like a writer:\nReading as a writer would compel me to question what might have brought the author\nto make these decisions, and then decide what worked and what didn\u2019t. What could\nhave made that chapter better or easier to understand? How can I make sure I include\nsome of the good attributes of this writing style into my own? How can I take aspects\nthat I feel the writer failed at and make sure not to make the same mistakes in my\nwriting?\nQuestioning why the author made certain decisions. Considering what techniques\ncould have made the text better. Deciding how to include the best attributes of what\nyou read in your own writing. This is what Reading Like a Writer is all about.\nAre you ready to start reading?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 101 Works Cited\nBishop, Wendy. \u201cReading, Stealing, and Writing Like a Writer.\u201d Elements of Alternate\nStyle: Essays on Writing and Revision.

In this digital age, when bots and biases ramble across\nour social media fields of vision and interaction many, probably all, of us like to think of\nourselves as being fair and honest. In turn, though we want to believe that other people\nare fair and honest with us, we are often distrustful of what we read and hear on\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media outlets.\nThis article deals with why we are distrustful of what we read and hear. Specifically, it\nexplains how we may not detect the bad information we see because of our own built\nin and unacknowledged biases, or of the biases built into our society and into the social\nmedia algorithms of the online sources we rely on. Indeed, this article discusses just\nthose factors-- personal, social, and social media biases\u2014that we see but often do not\nrecognize in what we see when read, listen to, or view in our increasingly digital world.\nAfter reading this article you may wish to take one of Harvard University\u2019s Implicit\nAssociation Tests.

But the fact that low-credibility content spreads so\nquickly and easily suggests that people and the algorithms behind social media\nplatforms are vulnerable to manipulation.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 104 Explaining the tools developed at the Observatory on Social\nMedia.\nOur research has identified three types of bias that make the social media ecosystem\nvulnerable to both intentional and accidental misinformation. That is why our\nObservatory on Social Media at Indiana University is building tools to help people\nbecome aware of these biases and protect themselves from outside influences\ndesigned to exploit them.\nBias in the brain\nCognitive biases originate in the way the brain processes the information that every\nperson encounters every day. The brain can deal with only a finite amount of\ninformation, and too many incoming stimuli can cause information overload. That in\nitself has serious implications for the quality of information on social media. We\nhave found that steep competition for users\u2019 limited attention means that some\nideas go viral despite their low quality \u2013 even when people prefer to share high-\nquality content.\nTo avoid getting overwhelmed, the brain uses a number of tricks. These methods are\nusually effective, but may also become biases when applied in the wrong contexts.\nOne cognitive shortcut happens when a person is deciding whether to share a story\nthat appears on their social media feed. People are very affected by the emotional\nconnotations of a headline, even though that\u2019s not a good indicator of an article\u2019s\naccuracy. Much more important is who wrote the piece.\nScreenshots of the Fakey game. Mihai Avram and Filippo Menczer\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 105 To counter this bias, and help people pay more attention to the source of a claim\nbefore sharing it, we developed Fakey, a mobile news literacy game (free on Android\nand iOS) simulating a typical social media news feed, with a mix of news articles from\nmainstream and low-credibility sources. Players get more points for sharing news from\nreliable sources and flagging suspicious content for fact-checking. In the process, they\nlearn to recognize signals of source credibility, such as hyperpartisan claims and\nemotionally charged headlines.\nBias in society\nAnother source of bias comes from society. When people connect directly with their\npeers, the social biases that guide their selection of friends come to influence the\ninformation they see.\nIn fact, in our research we have found that it is possible to determine the political\nleanings of a Twitter user by simply looking at the partisan preferences of their\nfriends. Our analysis of the structure of these partisan communication networks found\nsocial networks are particularly efficient at disseminating information \u2013 accurate or\nnot \u2013 when they are closely tied together and disconnected from other parts of\nsociety.\nThe tendency to evaluate information more favorably if it comes from within their own\nsocial circles creates \u201cecho chambers\u201d that are ripe for manipulation, either\nconsciously or unintentionally. This helps explain why so many online conversations\ndevolve into \u201cus versus them\u201d confrontations.\nTo study how the structure of online social networks makes users vulnerable to\ndisinformation, we built Hoaxy, a system that tracks and visualizes the spread of\ncontent from low-credibility sources, and how it competes with fact-checking content.\nOur analysis of the data collected by Hoaxy during the 2016 U.S. presidential elections\nshows that Twitter accounts that shared misinformation were almost completely cut\noff from the corrections made by the fact-checkers.\nWhen we drilled down on the misinformation-spreading accounts, we found a very\ndense core group of accounts retweeting each other almost exclusively \u2013 including\nseveral bots. The only times that fact-checking organizations were ever quoted or\nmentioned by the users in the misinformed group were when questioning their\nlegitimacy or claiming the opposite of what they wrote.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 106 Bias in the machine\nThe third group of biases arises directly from the algorithms used to determine what\npeople see online. Both social media platforms and search engines employ them.\nThese personalization technologies are designed to select only the most engaging and\nrelevant content for each individual user. But in doing so, it may end up reinforcing the\ncognitive and social biases of users, thus making them even more vulnerable to\nmanipulation.\nFor instance, the detailed advertising tools built into many social media platforms let\ndisinformation campaigners exploit confirmation bias by tailoring messages to people\nwho are already inclined to believe them.\nAlso, if a user often clicks on Facebook links from a particular news source, Facebook\nwill tend to show that person more of that site\u2019s content. This so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d\neffect may isolate people from diverse perspectives, strengthening confirmation bias.\nOur own research shows that social media platforms expose users to a less diverse set\nof sources than do non-social media sites like Wikipedia. Because this is at the level of\na whole platform, not of a single user, we call this the homogeneity bias.\nAnother important ingredient of social media is information that is trending on the\nplatform, according to what is getting the most clicks. We call this popularity bias,\nbecause we have found that an algorithm designed to promote popular content may\nnegatively affect the overall quality of information on the platform. This also feeds into\nexisting cognitive bias, reinforcing what appears to be popular irrespective of its\nquality.\nAll these algorithmic biases can be manipulated by social bots, computer programs\nthat interact with humans through social media accounts. Most social bots, like\nTwitter\u2019s Big Ben, are harmless. However, some conceal their real nature and are used\nfor malicious intents, such as boosting disinformation or falsely creating the\nappearance of a grassroots movement, also called \u201castroturfing.\u201d We found evidence\nof this type of manipulation in the run-up to the 2010 U.S. midterm election.\nTo study these manipulation strategies, we developed a tool to detect social bots\ncalled Botometer. Botometer uses machine learning to detect bot accounts, by\ninspecting thousands of different features of Twitter accounts, like the times of its\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 107 posts, how often it tweets, and the accounts it follows and retweets. It is not perfect,\nbut it has revealed that as many as 15 percent of Twitter accounts show signs of being\nbots.\nUsing Botometer in conjunction with Hoaxy, we analyzed the core of the\nmisinformation network during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. We found many\nbots exploiting both the cognitive, confirmation and popularity biases of their victims\nand Twitter\u2019s algorithmic biases.\nThese bots are able to construct filter bubbles around vulnerable users, feeding them\nfalse claims and misinformation. First, they can attract the attention of human users\nwho support a particular candidate by tweeting that candidate\u2019s hashtags or by\nmentioning and retweeting the person. Then the bots can\namplify false claims smearing opponents by retweeting articles from low-credibility\nsources that match certain keywords. This activity also makes the algorithm highlight\nfor other users false stories that are being shared widely.\nUnderstanding complex vulnerabilities\nEven as our research, and others\u2019, shows how individuals, institutions and even entire\nsocieties can be manipulated on social media, there are many questions left to\nanswer. It\u2019s especially important to discover how these different biases interact with\neach other, potentially creating more complex vulnerabilities.\nTools like ours offer internet users more information about disinformation, and\ntherefore some degree of protection from its harms. The solutions will be only\ntechnological, though there will probably be some technical aspects to them. But they\nmust take into account the cognitive and social aspects of the problem.\nMisinformation and Biases Infect Social Media, Both Intentionally and Accidentally by\nGiovanni Luca Ciampaglia and Filippo Menczer is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 108 In this essay, author Neta Crawford addresses ecological issues of global warming and\nfossil fuel consumption from a sociopolitical perspective. She details the hypocrisy\nbetween governmental positions on climate change and the astronomical contributions\nmade by the U.S. Department of Defense to greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon\nfootprint left by military installations and operations alone rivals that of many smaller\ncountries and Crawford argues that massive amounts of funding toward protections\nagainst potential human advisories neglects the very immediate threat of climate\nchange. The ecological realities presented in this text offer an important perspective\non the environmental realities of our world. The certain catastrophes of climate\nchange, and even the political uprising resulting from said catastrophes, necessitates\nimmediate attention on the part of world governments and individuals like you.\n#ecology #technology #politics\nThe Defense Department Is Worried\nabout Climate Change and Also a Huge\nCarbon Emitter\nNeta Crawford\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 109 \"An F\/A 18 Super Hornet, assigned to the \"Blacklions\" of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA)\n213, flies over the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) during flight\noperations.\" by Lt. Cmdr. Johnnie Caldwell, U.S. Navy is in the Public Domain\nScientists and security analysts have warned for more than a decade that global\nwarming is a potential national security concern. They project that the consequences\nof global warming \u2013 rising seas, powerful storms, famine and diminished access to\nfresh water \u2013 may make regions of the world politically unstable and prompt mass\nmigration and refugee crises.\nSome worry that wars may follow.\nYet with few exceptions, the U.S. military\u2019s significant contribution to climate change\nhas received little attention. Although the Defense Department has significantly\nreduced its fossil fuel consumption since the early 2000s, it remains the world\u2019s single\nlargest consumer of oil \u2013 and as a result, one of the world\u2019s top greenhouse gas\nemitters.\nA broad carbon footprint\nI have studied war and peace for four decades. But I only focused on the scale of U.S.\nmilitary greenhouse gas emissions when I began co-teaching a course on climate\nchange and focused on the Pentagon\u2019s response to global warming. Yet, the\nDepartment of Defense is the U.S. government\u2019s largest fossil fuel consumer,\naccounting for between 77% and 80% of all federal government energy consumption\nsince 2001.\nIn a newly released study published by Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project, I\ncalculated U.S. military greenhouse gas emissions in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nfrom 1975 through 2017.\nToday China is the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitter, followed by the United\nStates. In 2017 the Pentagon\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions totaled over 59 million\nmetric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. If it were a country, it would have been the\nworld\u2019s 55th largest greenhouse gas emitter, with emissions larger than Portugal,\nSweden or Denmark.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 110 The largest sources of military greenhouse gas emissions are buildings and fuel. The\nDefense Department maintains over 560,000 buildings at approximately 500 domestic\nand overseas military installations, which account for about 40% of its greenhouse gas\nemissions.\nThe rest comes from operations. In fiscal year 2016, for instance, the Defense\nDepartment consumed about 86 million barrels of fuel for operational purposes.\nWhy do the armed forces use so much fuel?\nMilitary weapons and equipment use so much fuel that the relevant measure for\ndefense planners is frequently gallons per mile.\nAircraft are particularly thirsty. For example, the B-2 stealth bomber, which holds more\nthan 25,600 gallons of jet fuel, burns 4.28 gallons per mile and emits more than 250\nmetric tons of greenhouse gas over a 6,000 nautical mile range. The KC-135R aerial\nrefueling tanker consumes about 4.9 gallons per mile.\nA single mission consumes enormous quantities of fuel. In January 2017, two B-2B\nbombers and 15 aerial refueling tankers traveled more than 12,000 miles from\nWhiteman Air Force Base to bomb ISIS targets in Libya, killing about 80 suspected\nISIS militants. Not counting the tankers\u2019 emissions, the B-2s emitted about 1,000\nmetric tons of greenhouse gases.\nQuantifying military emissions\nCalculating the Defense Department\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions isn\u2019t easy. The\nDefense Logistics Agency tracks fuel purchases, but the Pentagon does not\nconsistently report DOD fossil fuel consumption to Congress in its annual budget\nrequests.\nThe Department of Energy publishes data on DOD energy production and fuel\nconsumption, including for vehicles and equipment. Using fuel consumption data, I\nestimate that from 2001 through 2017, the DOD, including all service branches,\nemitted 1.2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases. That is the rough equivalent of\ndriving of 255 million passenger vehicles over a year.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 111 Of that total, I estimated that war-related emissions between 2001 and 2017, including\n\u201coverseas contingency operations\u201d in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Syria, generated\nover 400 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent \u2014 roughly equivalent to the greenhouse\nemissions of almost 85 million cars in one year.\nReal and present dangers?\nThe Pentagon\u2019s core mission is to prepare for potential attacks by human adversaries.\nAnalysts argue about the likelihood of war and the level of military preparation\nnecessary to prevent it, but in my view, none of the United States\u2019 adversaries \u2013 Russia,\nIran, China and North Korea \u2013 are certain to attack the United States.\nNor is a large standing military the only way to reduce the threats these adversaries\npose. Arms control and diplomacy can often de-escalate tensions and reduce threats.\nEconomic sanctions can diminish the capacity of states and nonstate actors to\nthreaten the security interests of the U.S. and its allies.\nIn contrast, climate change is not a potential risk. It has begun, with real\nconsequences to the United States. Failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will\nmake the nightmare scenarios strategists warn against \u2013 perhaps even \u201cclimate\nwars\u201d \u2013 more likely.\nA case for decarbonizing the military\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 112 Over the past last decade the Defense Department has reduced its fossil fuel\nconsumption through actions that include using renewable energy, weatherizing\nbuildings and reducing aircraft idling time on runways.\nThe DOD\u2019s total annual emissions declined from a peak of 85 million metric tons of\ncarbon dioxide equivalent in 2004 to 59 million metric tons in 2017. The goal, as then-\nGeneral James Mattis put it, is to be \u201cunleashed from the tether of fuel\u201d by decreasing\nmilitary dependence on oil and oil convoys that are vulnerable to attack in war zones.\nSince 1979, the United States has placed a high priority on protecting access to the\nPersian Gulf. About one-fourth of military operational fuel use is for the U.S. Central\nCommand, which covers the Persian Gulf region.\nAs national security scholars have argued, with dramatic growth in renewable energy\nand diminishing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, it is possible for Congress and the\npresident to rethink our nation\u2019s military missions and reduce the amount of energy\nthe armed forces use to protect access to Middle East oil.\nI agree with the military and national security experts who contend that climate\nchange should be front and center in U.S. national security debates. Cutting Pentagon\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 113 greenhouse gas emissions will help save lives in the United States, and could\ndiminish the risk of climate conflict.\nThe Defense Department Is Worried about Climate Change \u2013 and Also a Huge Carbon\nEmitter by Neta C.

Knowledge, and thus,\nthe knowledge of composition and writing, is a good that everyone should have access\nto. Education should not be privatized (think of how much college costs, and how not\neveryone can afford to attend). Writing development is an ongoing process, like all\nlearning, and according to Daly, students should have access to the resources that help\nin the development of writing for the entirety of their lives.\nIntroduction by Ashton Conley\n#ecology #research\nSustaining Our Commonwealth of\nNature and Knowledge\nHerman Daly\nLet\u2019s start with this phrase: \u201csustaining our commonwealth.\u201d By sustaining, I don\u2019t\nmean preserving inviolate; I mean using, without using up. Using with maintenance and\nreplenishment is an important idea in economics. It\u2019s the very basis of the concept of\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 115 income, because income is the maximum that you can consume today and still be able\nto produce and consume the same amount tomorrow \u2013 that is, maximum consumption\nwithout depleting capital in the broad sense of future productive capacity. By\ncommonwealth, I mean the wealth that no one has made, or the wealth that practically\neveryone has made. So it\u2019s either nature \u2013 nobody made it, we all inherited it \u2013 or\nknowledge \u2013 everybody contributed to making it, but everyone\u2019s contribution is small in\nrelation to the total and depends on the contributions of others. In managing the\ncommonwealth of nature, our big problem is that we tend to treat the truly scarce as if\nit were non-scarce. The opposite problem arises with the commonwealth of\nknowledge, in which we tend to treat what is truly not scarce as if it were.\nClarifying Scarcity\nThere are two sets of important distinctions about goods, and they make four cross-\nclassifications (see figure below). Goods can be either rival or non-rival, and they can\nbe either excludable or non-excludable. My shirt, for example, is a rival good because if\nI'm wearing it, you can\u2019t wear it at the same time. The warmth of the sun is non-rival\nbecause I can enjoy the warmth of the sun, and everyone else can enjoy it at the same\ntime. Rivalness is a physical property that precludes the simultaneous use of goods by\nmore than one person. Goods are also excludable or non-excludable. That\u2019s not a\nphysical concept, that\u2019s a legal concept, a question of property. For example, you could\nwear my shirt tomorrow if I let you, but that\u2019s up to me because it\u2019s my property. My\nshirt is both rival and excludable, and that\u2019s the case with most market goods.\nMeanwhile, the warmth of the sun is both non-rival and also non-excludable. We cannot\nbuy and sell solar warmth; we cannot bottle it and charge for it. Goods that are rival and\nexcludable are market goods. Goods that are non-rival and non-excludable are public\ngoods. That leaves two other categories. Fish in the ocean are an example of goods\nthat are rival and non-excludable. They are rival, because if I catch the fish, you can\u2019t\ncatch it. But they are also non-excludable, because I can\u2019t stop you from fishing in the\nopen seas. The management of goods that are rival and non-excludable gives rise to\nthe famous tragedy of the commons \u2013 or the tragedy of open-access resources, as it\u2019s\nmore accurately called. Now, the other problematic category consists of goods that are\nnon-rival and excludable. If I use the Pythagorean Theorem, I don\u2019t prevent you from\nusing it at the same time. Knowledge is non-rival, but it often is made excludable\nthrough intellectual property and patent rights. So those are two difficult categories\nthat create problems. One is the tragedy of the commons, and the other we could call\nthe tragedy of artificial scarcity.\nThe Commonwealth of Nature\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 116 Fish in the ocean are an example of the commonwealth of nature. I\u2019ll ague that natural\ngoods and services that are rival and have so far remained non-excludable should be\nenclosed in the market in order to avoid unsustainable use. Excludability can take the\nform of individual property rights or social property rights \u2013 what needs to be avoided\nis open access. For dealing with the broad class of rival but, up to now, non-excludable\ngoods, the so-called cap-auction-trade system is a market-based institution that merits\nconsideration.\nIn addition to its practical value, the cap-auction-trade system also sheds light on a\nfundamental issue of economic theory: the logically separate issues of scale,\ndistribution, and allocation. Neoclassical economics deals mainly with the question of\nallocation. Allocation is the apportionment of resources among competing uses: how\nmany resources go to produce beans, how many to cars, how many to haircuts.\nProperly functioning markets allocate resources efficiently, more or less. Yet the\nconcept of efficient allocation presupposes a given distribution. Distribution is the\napportionment of goods and resources among different people: how many resources\ngo to you, how many to somebody else. A good distribution is one that is fair or just \u2013\nnot efficient, but fair. The third issue is scale: the physical size of the economy relative\nto the ecosystem that sustains it. How many of us are there and how large are the\nassociated matter-energy flows from producing all our stuff, relative to natural cycles\nand the maintenance of the biosphere. In neoclassical economics, the issue of scale is\ncompletely off the radar screen.\nThe cap-auction-trade system works like this. Some environmental assets, say fishing\nrights or the rights to emit sulfur dioxide, have been treated as non-excludable free\ngoods. As economic growth increases the scale of the economy relative to that of the\nbiosphere, it becomes recognized that these goods are in fact physically rival. The first\nstep is to put a cap \u2013 a maximum \u2013 on the scale of use of that resource, at a level\nwhich is deemed to be environmentally sustainable. Setting that cap \u2013 deciding what it\nshould be \u2013 is not a market decision, but a social and ecological decision. Then, the\nright to extract that resource or emit that waste, up to the cap, becomes a scarce asset.\nIt was a free good. Now it has a price. We\u2019ve created a new valuable asset, so the\nquestion is: Who owns it? This also has to be decided politically, outside the market.\nOwnership of this new asset should be auctioned to the highest bidder, with the\nproceeds entering the public treasury. Sometimes rights are simply given to the\nhistorical private users \u2013 a bad idea, I think, but frequently done under the misleading\nlabel of \u201cgrandfathering.\u201d\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 117 The cap-auction-trade system is not, as often called, \u201cfree-market environmentalism.\u201d\nIt is really socially constrained, market environmentalism. Someone must own the\nassets before they can be traded in the market, and that is an issue of distribution. Only\nafter the scale question is answered, and then the distribution question, can we have\nmarket exchange to answer the question of allocation.\nAnother good policy for managing the commonwealth of nature is ecological tax\nreform. This means shifting the tax base away from income earned by labor and capital\nand onto the resource flow from nature. Taxing what we want less of, depletion and\npollution, seems to be a better idea than taxing what we want more of, namely income.\nUnlike the cap-auction-trade system, ecological tax reform would exert only a very\nindirect and uncertain limit on the scale of the economy relative to the biosphere. Yet, it\nwould go a long way toward improving allocation and distribution.\nThe Commonwealth of Knowledge\nIf you stand in front of the McKeldin Library at the University of Maryland, you\u2019ll see a\nquotation from Thomas Jefferson carved on one of the stones: \u201cKnowledge is the\ncommon property of mankind.\u201d Well, I think Mr. Jefferson was right. Once knowledge\nexists, it is non-rival, which means it has a zero opportunity cost. As we know from\nstudying price theory, price is supposed to measure opportunity cost, and if\nopportunity cost is zero, then price should be zero. Certainly, new knowledge, even\nthough it should be allocated freely, does have a cost of production. Sometimes that\ncost of production is substantial, as with the space program\u2019s discovery that there\u2019s no\nlife on Mars. On the other hand, a new insight could occur to you while you\u2019re lying in\nbed staring at the ceiling and cost absolutely nothing, as was the case with Renee\nDescartes\u2019 invention of analytic geometry. Many new discoveries are accidental.\nOthers are motivated by the joy and excitement of research, independent of any\nmaterial motivation. Yet the dominant view is that unless knowledge is kept scarce\nenough to have a significant price, nobody in the market will have an incentive to\nproduce it. Patent monopolies and intellectual property rights are urged as the way to\nprovide an extrinsic reward for knowledge production. Even within that restricted\nvision, keeping knowledge scarce still makes very little sense, because the main input\nto the production of new knowledge is existing knowledge. If you keep existing\nknowledge expensive, that\u2019s surely going to slow down the production of new\nknowledge.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 118 In Summary\nManaging the commonwealth of nature and knowledge presents us two rather\nopposite problems and solutions. I\u2019ve argued that the commonwealth of nature should\nbe enclosed as property, as much as possible as public property, and administered so\nas to capture scarcity rents for public revenue. Examples of natural commons include:\nmining, logging, grazing rights, the electromagnetic spectrum, the absorptive capacity\nof the atmosphere, and the orbital locations of satellites. The commonwealth of\nknowledge, on the other hand, should be freed from enclosure as property and treated\nas the non-rival good that it is. Abolishing all intellectual property rights tomorrow is\ndraconian, but I do think we could grant patent monopolies for fewer \u201cinventions\u201d and\nfor shorter time periods.\nSustaining Our Commonwealth of Nature and Knowledge by Herman Daly is licensed\nunder a CC BY-NC-ND: Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 119 In this essay, Louis DeSipio details the political activism of American Latino groups in\nthe last two centuries and how their actions led to important civil and voting rights. The\nstruggle for inclusivity and representation still exists for these groups, and the need for\na collective political voice for the community remains a constant struggle dating back\ngenerations. Regarding the perspective of pan-ethnic Latino minorities as well as\ntransnational Latino immigrants, DeSipio details past efforts to gain electoral voting\npower and political inclusion leading into the current era of Latino national groups\ncontinuing to struggle for their voices to be heard.\n#diversity #politics #sociology #history\nDemanding Equal Political Voice\u2026And\nAccepting Nothing Less: The Quest for\nLatino Political Inclusion\nLouis DeSipio\nOver the past century and a half, diverse Latino communities have mobilized to\ndemand civic and political inclusion, a process that has also facilitated the formation\nof a pan-ethnic political identity. Although there have been continuous gains, the quest\nfor full and equal inclusion remains. The fact that the Latino population continues to\ngrow in numbers and needs, and that this growth is often seen as a challenge to the\nmajority population, ensures that Latinos will remain politically engaged in the pursuit\nof a full political voice in the upcoming decades.\nContemporary Latino politics is founded on generations of prior struggles for inclusion.\nThese struggles have been organized around a consistent set of demands \u2013 ones that\nmake the ongoing Latino struggle for civic and political inclusion a very American one\n\u2013 for equal protection of the law and the ability to participate equally in American\nsociety regardless of race or ethnicity. At the same time, like other racial\/ethnic\ncommunities who are largely built on immigration, Latinos, particularly Latino\nimmigrants, have sought to maintain transnational ties to their communities and\ncountries of origin. This ongoing transnationalism among some immigrants has not\ndiminished Latino efforts for inclusion in United States politics. Rather, transnational\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 120 engagement often provides skills and networks that add to the resources for\ndemanding inclusion in the U.S.\n. . . . . . .\nPrior to the contemporary era, collective efforts primarily took the form of community-\nbased, civic, and trade union organizing. In the current era (the period after the civil\nrights revolution of the 1960s), electoral politics and voting added to the palette of\ncollective political activities\u2026\nColonial and Immigrant Roots of Latino Demands for Political\nInclusion\nLatino collective organizing to achieve a civic and political voice is a largely 20th and\n21st-century phenomenon. While the Latino presence in the U.S. pre-dates these 20th-\ncentury accomplishments, prior to the current era, Latino communities lacked the\ngroup resources, leadership, and organizations to demand equal rights in U.S. society.\nConsequently, demands were primarily individual rather than collective.\n. . . . . . . . . .\nDespite the fact that there was little collective action to demand civic inclusion in\nMexican American and Puerto Rican communities in the late 19th century, there were\nefforts by individuals to highlight inequalities and obstacles. Mexican Americans in the\nSouthwest, for instance, used the federal and state courts to assert their citizenship\nrights. Issues before the courts included the right of Mexican immigrants to naturalize\n(In re Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez [1897]), to hold public office (People v. de la Guerra [1870]),\nand to serve on juries or to be tried by juries that included Mexican Americans (George\nCarter v. Territory of New Mexico [1859]). The courts were also the locus of Mexican\nAmerican demands for the enforcement of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo\u2019s\nprotections of the property rights of Mexican Americans who had owned land in the\nSouthwest before the U.S.-Mexican War.\nDuring this period, local political machines also courted Latino voters. This form of\norganization existed in New Mexico and South Texas; the New York Democratic\nmachine intermittently sought the votes of Puerto Ricans in some elections and\nexcluded them in others as late as the 1950s. For the most part, however, these\nmachines engaged Latino communities to serve the ends of the political parties and\nLatinos had little influence on the people their votes elected. In the early period of\nMexican American presence in the Southwest, some unions organized Latino workers,\nparticularly the mining unions and the anarchists. This union outreach was the\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 121 exception rather than the rule, however, and did not add to the community\u2019s public\nleadership\u2026\nOrganized Latino Voices for Civic Inclusion in the Early 20th\nCentury: Initial Steps\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Latinos started to organize more broadly to meet their\ncollective needs, including the creation of insurance pools to meet end-of-life financial\nneeds, but these efforts were largely apolitical. Early Latino civic organizing took on a\nmore explicitly political dimension in the late 1920s and 1930s. This era saw the\nformation of the first regional Mexican American civic organizations as well as labor\norganizing that included the first \u201cnational\u201d Latino political movement. It was these\nefforts that laid the foundation for post-World War II civic and political gains\u2026\n[The League of United Latin American Citizens,] LULAC was established in 1929.[6] Its\nfounders included the small Mexican American middle class \u2013 largely small business\nowners \u2013 that had emerged over the previous 20 years in small towns in Texas. The\ngoals of the organization were both revolutionary and assimilationist. Their leadership\nsought to challenge and reverse the discrimination that had characterized the\ntreatment of Mexican Americans in the Southwest since 1848. They used the tools\navailable to them as U.S. citizens, particularly the courts, to challenge the largely\nunquestioned position of whites and the long-dominant policy of anti-Mexican\ndiscrimination. Their core claim was equal protection as U.S. citizens under the law.\nLULAC members did distinguish themselves, however, from recent immigrants of\nMexican ancestry by limiting membership to U.S. citizens and conducting meetings in\nEnglish. The organization offered assistance to Mexican immigrants seeking to\nnaturalize, but did not believe there was a political or civic equality between non-\nnaturalized immigrants and U.S. citizens. In the 1930s, LULAC conducted voter\nregistration drives, encouraged members to support candidates who spoke to Mexican\nAmerican concerns, organized to end the poll tax, and used the courts to challenge\ndiscrimination, particularly educational discrimination. Soon after its formation, LULAC\nsought to organize Mexican American women. In the early 1930s, several chapters\nformed Ladies\u2019 Auxiliaries. In 1938, the LULAC President established the position of\nNational Organizer for Women, which was later changed to the National Vice President\nof the organization.\nDespite their somewhat narrow focus and the middle-class status of the early\nmembers, LULAC chapters quickly emerged throughout the Southwest making it the\nfirst regional Latino organization. Moreover, LULAC\u2019s leaders developed a political\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 122 alliance with Lyndon Johnson who was beginning his national rise in this period.[7]\nThis alliance represented the first steps in building a Latino voice in national politics.\n. . . . . . .\nLatino Civic and Political Organizing in the Civil Rights Era\nThe 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s saw a rapid expansion in Latino demand making\nand the formation of diverse paths to political organizing. It also saw the foundation of\nLatino electoral influence. As was the case in the African American community and its\ncivil rights movement in part of this period, leadership emerged from new segments of\nthe population, including returning World War II and Korean War veterans and college\neducated young adults.[10] Contesting social inequality and continuing the fight\nagainst discrimination became central to the nascent Latino political identity of this\nera\u2026 In each case, anger over state-sanctioned discrimination and denial of rights was\nat the core of their mobilization efforts\u2026 [T]hese movements appeared in all parts of\nthe country with concentrated Latino populations. Although they did not form a\nnational Latino movement as we understand it today, their recognition of the shared\nexperiences of Latinos nationwide laid the foundation for the pan-ethnic Latino politics\nthat emerged in the post-civil rights era.\n. . . . . . .\nLatino youth, primarily U.S.-born young people, were among the most active. Their\nactivism reflected Latino-specific concerns over discrimination and disparate\noutcomes, but also the anger of young adults in general in this era over the war in\nVietnam.[12] Resentment over discriminatory public education spurred a series of\nwalkouts\u2026 in Los Angeles high schools. These spontaneous movements coalesced in\norganizing to reform the delivery of education and in anti-war mobilization under the\nauspices of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO).[13] Similar efforts\nappeared in other areas of Latino concentration in the Southwest. The Crusade for\nJustice, formed in Denver, focused its energies on youth more broadly including young\nadults in schools and in (and out of) the workplace.[14] At its 1969 conference, the\nPlan Espiritual de Aztl\u00e1n was presented publicly for the first time. The Plan is the\nfounding document of the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanos de Aztl\u00e1n (MEChA) and\ncalled for Chicano self-determination and ethnic pride. MEChA is the only national\nLatino student organization on college and university campuses during this period still\nactive today.\nYoung adults also led new movements to challenge white-dominated political\ninstitutions. They sought election to local offices in rural Texas, demonstrated that\nMexican Americans could be mobilized, and use their numbers to challenge electoral\ndiscrimination\u2026[15]\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 123 Young Latino adults also mobilized in Puerto Rican communities, which had grown\ndramatically after World War II.[17] Because of the Jones Act, which provided U.S.\ncitizenship to Puerto Ricans, and the increased demand of cheap labor after the war,\nhundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans made their way to New York, New Jersey,\nPhiladelphia, and Chicago, and other cities. Puerto Rican migrants who seized this\nopportunity tended to be unskilled laborers and, later, rural migrants pushed off the\nland as Puerto Rican agriculture industrialized. Like the Mexican residents of the\nSouthwest in the years after the U.S.-Mexican War, early 20th-century Puerto Rican\nmigrants had few economic resources and were the targets of racial and ethnic\ndiscrimination.\n. . . . . . .\nThe frequently confrontational style of these newly emerging organizations in this era\n\u2013 and their new generation of leaders \u2013 should not obscure the core of their demands.\nThey sought full inclusion in U.S. society as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and\nsaw, as the primary strategy to achieve that goal, the opportunity to elect the candidate\nof their choice to office. Although their rhetoric sometimes focused on the distinct\nexperiences of Latinos and separateness, their demands and goals focused on the\nequal ability to compete in the civic and political world. In this, their pluralist demands\nwere similar to those of other excluded groups in U.S. society seeking an equal voice.\nThe new opportunities for Latino civic organizing in the civil rights era were also not\nlimited to challenging existing political structures from the outside. This era also saw\nthe foundation of Latino voices within the major political parties and social institutions\nas well as the formation of Latino-led institutions to research, document, and articulate\nthe Latino condition.\n. . . . . . .\nThe national Latino civil rights organizations that formed in this period reflected a new\nposition of Latinos in U.S. society that would not have been possible had the more\nactivist organizations not challenged local and state power structures that had denied\nLatinos equal protection of the laws. The national organizations were more explicitly\npluralist in their rhetoric and operations, but they and the more activist organizations\nshared a vision of Latino empowerment by challenging barriers and expanding the\nLatino electoral and economic voice. Occasional activist rhetoric aside, the demands of\nthe civil rights era focused on ensuring that the language of the 14th and 15th\nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution became the practice as well as the law of the\nland. The new national organizations ensured a new and permanent institutional\nresource to articulate the demand for Latino civic and political inclusion.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 124 The Continuing Struggle for Latino Civic Inclusion in the\nContemporary United States\nDespite the breakthroughs of the civil rights period, struggles for Latino inclusion\ncontinued in the post-civil rights era... The major legislative legacies of the civil rights\nera were federal commitments to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution guaranteeing equal protection of the laws and equal access to the ballot\nbox. Civil rights and voting rights legislation created a new playing field for Latino\ndemands for civic inclusion; the advocacy organizations that were established in the\ncivil rights era and the steadily growing number of Latino elected and appointed\nofficeholders ensured that Latino voices would be heard on issues of importance to the\ncommunity.\nThe demography of the community also changed. Changes to national immigration law\nas well as higher than average birth rates ensured that the Latino population grew more\nrapidly than other groups. By 2012, Latinos numbered more than 50 million and made\nup more than 16 percent of the national population (compared to approximately 6\nmillion in 1960 who made up over just 3 percent of the U.S. population)\u2026\nThe Latino fight for civic inclusion thus continues\u2026 What are new, however, are the\nhigh share of non-naturalized immigrants in the Latino (and Asian American)\npopulation and the growing share of immigrants made up of unauthorized immigrants\nwho do not have a path to naturalization. It is, of course, difficult to present precise\nestimates of the unauthorized immigrant population. Yet, the best estimates suggest\nthat of the approximately 11.5 million unauthorized immigrants resident in the U.S. in\n2011, 8.9 million were Latino.[29] Whereas in the past, unauthorized migrants have\nbeen able to regularize their status over time, partisan polarization in Congress has\nprevented a compromise that would allow for a widespread legalization. This policy\nintransigence has spurred a new form of Latino civic activism among young adult\nundocumented migrants who migrated with their parents as young children. They have\nbanded together as \u201cDreamers\u201d tapping the nomenclature of the DREAM Act, which\nwould offer a path to legal status to young adult unauthorized migrants who attended\ncollege or joined the U.S. military.\n. . . . . . .\nAt the same time, the contemporary struggle for Latino civic and political inclusion is\nnot simply a battle for immigrant rights.[36] U.S. citizen Latinos continue to face\nbarriers to participation, some of which pre-date civil rights era reforms. Voter\nregistration requirements, for example, were originally implemented to dampen the\npolitical power of turn-of-the-twentieth-century European immigrants.[37] They were\neffective then and continue to have a disproportionate and negative impact on young,\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 125 poor, and less educated adults in U.S. society. Latinos are more likely to have high\nshares of the population in each of these categories. The colonial legacy of Puerto\nRico denies the vote to the nearly four million residents of the Island\u2026\nNew and arguably more subtle forms of discrimination have emerged in the post-civil\nrights era. At present, the most insidious of these is voter identification requirements\nthat many states are imposing. Latinos otherwise eligible to vote are less likely to have\nthe required forms of identification and, consequently, will be less likely to vote\u2026\nThe organizational infrastructure that emerged in the post-civil rights era continues to\nadvocate, litigate, and organize to address these issues and to expand the Latino\npolitical voice. Latino representation at all levels of elective office has increased\nsteadily over the past 30 years. It has also become more diverse.[38] Latinas make up\na higher share of Latino officeholders than do white women of white officeholders.\nLatino officeholders increasingly also include Latinos who trace their ancestry to the\ncountries of Latin America that began to send large numbers of migrants to the U.S.\nafter 1960... The \u201cLatino vote\u201d is now routinely sought in national and many state-level\nraces. A new generation of Latino campaign professionals has emerged to ensure that\nany candidate who wants to seek Latino votes can reach Latino voters\u2026 Latino\norganizations also more continually offer support for Latinos seeking to naturalize.\nVoter registration efforts routinely expand prior to national elections... Increasingly,\nLatino organizations and leaders are also able to use coalitional politics to achieve\ncollective goals. These coalitions often include non-Latinos and non-Latino\norganizations around areas of common concern, such as immigrant rights with Asian\nAmerican and Jewish organizations, civil rights and affirmative action with African\nAmerican organizations, and pocketbook issues such as access to health care with\nunions and progressive Democrats. The size and growing political savvy of Latino\ncommunities ensures that these coalitions can be both effective at securing policy\noutcomes that benefit Latinos and providing the foundation for Latinos to develop\nleadership skills and seek elective office.\nConclusions\nDespite changes in the structure of U.S. politics and the opportunities for Latino civic\nand political voice in the post-civil rights era, it is important to observe what has\nremained the same. The philosophy motivating mainstream Latino demands continues\nto be one of equal access to political rights and responsibilities. Latinos continue to\nneed to challenge barriers to make their demands on political institutions. In 2006, in\nresponse to legislation passed in the U.S. House of Representatives making\nunauthorized immigrant status a crime, as many as five million people, most of whom\nwere Latino, peacefully protested nationwide. The marchers included immigrant and\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 126 native Latinos. The legacy of these marches included policy outcomes \u2013\ncriminalization was rejected by the Senate \u2013 and political gains. The rate of growth of\nthe Latino electorate increased in 2008, at least in part in response to post-march\ndrives to translate protest into votes. The Latino community was able to respond so\nquickly and, arguably, so effectively because institutions and organizations existed to\nchannel anger and frustration into [a] collective political voice. With growing numbers\nand increasingly sophisticated organization, Latinos continue to engage with old and\nnew challenges, and in the process contribute to the renewing of democracy in the U.S.\nWorks Cited\nJuan Gonz\u00e1lez, Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America (New York: Viking,\n2000).\nDavid G.

Doctorow\u2019s\ntechniques range from setting an appropriate work schedule that maximizes\nproductivity and consistency to eliminating the distractions of instant communication.\nTexts like this one offer important insight into what challenges you face as a new\ngeneration of writers who have grown up with the internet. You should be aware of the\nmany, many potential distractions that come with digital writing and researching, but\nyou should also work to cultivate a symbiotic relationship between your writing\nprocess and the internet. Social media, blog posts, and research databases are all tools\nreadily available to you that can either hinder your writing or help it flourish.\n#literacy #technology #sociology\nWriting in the Age of Distraction\nCory Doctorow\n\"Distractions\" by Emily Boston is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 131 We know that our readers are distracted and sometimes even overwhelmed by the\nmyriad distractions that lie one click away on the Internet, but of course writers face\nthe same glorious problem: the delirious world of information and communication and\ncommunity that lurks behind your screen, one alt-tab away from your word-processor.\nThe single worst piece of writing advice I ever got was to stay away from the Internet\nbecause it would only waste my time and wouldn't help my writing. This advice was\nwrong creatively, professionally, artistically, and personally, but I know where the writer\nwho doled it out was coming from. Every now and again, when I see a new website,\ngame, or service, I sense the tug of an attention black hole: a time-sink that is just\nwaiting to fill my every discretionary moment with distraction. As a co-parenting new\nfather who writes at least a book per year, half-a-dozen columns a month, ten or more\nblog posts a day, plus assorted novellas and stories and speeches, I know just how\nshort time can be and how dangerous distraction is.\nBut the Internet has been very good to me. It's informed my creativity and aesthetics,\nit's benefited me professionally and personally, and for every moment it steals, it gives\nback a hundred delights. I'd no sooner give it up than I'd give up fiction or any other\npleasurable vice.\nI think I've managed to balance things out through a few simple techniques that I've\nbeen refining for years. I still sometimes feel frazzled and info-whelmed, but that's\nrare. Most of the time, I'm on top of my workload and my muse. Here's how I do it:\nShort, regular work schedule\nWhen I'm working on a story or novel, I set a modest daily goal \u2014 usually a page or two\n\u2014 and then I meet it every day, doing nothing else while I'm working on it. It's not\nplausible or desirable to try to get the world to go away for hours at a time, but it's\nentirely possible to make it all shut up for 20 minutes. Writing a page every day gets\nme more than a novel per year \u2014 do the math \u2014 and there's always 20 minutes to be\nfound in a day, no matter what else is going on. Twenty minutes is a short enough\ninterval that it can be claimed from a sleep or meal-break (though this shouldn't\nbecome a habit). The secret is to do it every day, weekends included, to keep the\nmomentum going, and to allow your thoughts to wander to your next day's page\nbetween sessions. Try to find one or two vivid sensory details to work into the next\npage, or a bon mot, so that you've already got some material when you sit down at the\nkeyboard.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 132 Leave yourself a rough edge\nWhen you hit your daily word-goal, stop. Stop even if you're in the middle of a sentence.\nEspecially if you're in the middle of a sentence. That way, when you sit down at the\nkeyboard the next day, your first five or ten words are already ordained, so that you get\na little push before you begin your work. Knitters leave a bit of yarn sticking out of the\nday's knitting so they know where to pick up the next day \u2014 they call it the \"hint.\"\nPotters leave a rough edge on the wet clay before they wrap it in plastic for the night \u2014\nit's hard to build on a smooth edge.\nDon't research\nResearching isn't writing and vice-versa. When you come to a factual matter that you\ncould google in a matter of seconds, don't. Don't give in and look up the length of the\nBrooklyn Bridge, the population of Rhode Island, or the distance to the Sun. That way\nlies distraction \u2014 an endless click-trance that will turn your 20 minutes of composing\ninto a half-day's idyll through the web. Instead, do what journalists do: type \"TK\" where\nyour fact should go, as in \"The Brooklyn bridge, all TK feet of it, sailed into the air like a\nkite.\" \"TK\" appears in very few English words (the one I get tripped up on is \"Atkins\") so\na quick search through your document for \"TK\" will tell you whether you have any fact-\nchecking to do afterwards. And your editor and copyeditor will recognize it if you miss\nit and bring it to your attention.\nDon't be ceremonious\nForget advice about finding the right atmosphere to coax your muse into the room.\nForget candles, music, silence, a good chair, a cigarette, or putting the kids to sleep. It's\nnice to have all your physical needs met before you write, but if you convince yourself\nthat you can only write in a perfect world, you compound the problem of finding 20 free\nminutes with the problem of finding the right environment at the same time. When the\ntime is available, just put fingers to keyboard and write. You can put up with\nnoise\/silence\/kids\/discomfort\/hunger for 20 minutes.\nKill your word-processor\nWord, Google Office and OpenOffice all come with a bewildering array of typesetting\nand automation settings that you can play with forever. Forget it. All that stuff is\ndistraction, and the last thing you want is your tool second-guessing you, \"correcting\"\nyour spelling, criticizing your sentence structure, and so on. The programmers who\nwrote your word processor type all day long, every day, and they have the power to buy\nor acquire any tool they can imagine for entering text into a computer. They don't write\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 133 their software with Word. They use a text-editor, like vi, Emacs, TextPad, BBEdit, Gedit,\nor any of a host of editors. These are some of the most venerable, reliable, powerful\ntools in the history of software (since they're at the core of all other software) and they\nhave almost no distracting features \u2014 but they do have powerful search-and-replace\nfunctions. Best of all, the humble .txt file can be read by practically every application on\nyour computer, can be pasted directly into an email, and can't transmit a virus.\nReal-time communications tools are deadly\nThe biggest impediment to concentration is your computer's ecosystem of interruption\ntechnologies: IM, email alerts, RSS alerts, Skype rings, etc. Anything that requires you\nto wait for a response, even subconsciously, occupies your attention. Anything that\nleaps up on your screen to announce something new, occupies your attention. The\nmore you can train your friends and family to use email, message boards, and similar\ntechnologies that allow you to save up your conversation for planned sessions instead\nof demanding your attention right now helps you carve out your 20 minutes. By all\nmeans, schedule a chat \u2014 voice, text, or video \u2014 when it's needed, but leaving your IM\nrunning is like sitting down to work after hanging a giant \"DISTRACT ME\" sign over your\ndesk, one that shines brightly enough to be seen by the entire world.\nI don't claim to have invented these techniques, but they're the ones that have made the\n21st century a good one for me.\nWriting in the Age of Distraction by Cory Doctorow is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 134 R.G. Dunlop\u2019s article introduces at least two ideas writers need to know. First,\njournalists say that all engaging writing is about people. Even when a story seems to be\nabout something else, it\u2019s still about people. \u201cThe Elk, the Tourists, and the Missing\nCoal Country Jobs\u201d seems to be about a place, or even a plan for a business, but\npeople are on all sides of the story too. As you read, look for whose story Dunlop tells\nand why those stories matter. The developers have a story. They work hard to promote\nthe story they want the public to hear. The people who live in the community, from\nfamilies that have lived there for generations, have stories too. And those stories help\nmake up the history of the Appalachian region of Kentucky. The question is, whose\nstories will define the future and what kind of story will that be?\nAs Dunlop developed his story on the Appalachian Wildlife Center, now called Boone\u2019s\nRidge, he gathered information in a variety of ways. You\u2019ve learned about how\nimportant it is to get evidence and document sources. The second idea to pay attention\nto in Dunlop\u2019s article is not just what he does with his research, but what he says about\nthe ways some people he profiles handle evidence and support for their ideas. As you\nread, note those places where documentation can be expected but is missing. While\nyou may get frustrated with your professor because forgetting to document a source\nimpacts your grade, Dunlop is investigating the use of millions of dollars. He suggests\nthat there\u2019s a lack of oversight. He never states what he thinks might explain that, but\nhe leaves it to the reader to fill in the blanks. Clearly, though, his questions must make\nsome people he writes about uncomfortable. As you read, think about the writer\u2019s role\nand responsibility in telling a compelling story and telling the truth. That perspective\nwill shape your opinion of this story and will inform the writing you do, too.\nIntroduction by Gill Hunter\n#appalachia #ecology #politics #sociology #research\nThe Elk, the Tourists, and the Missing\nCoal Country Jobs\nR.G. Dunlop\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 135 Standing at the site of a long-abandoned, multimillion dollar industrial park in\nNovember 2016, U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers urged residents in southeastern Kentucky\u2019s Bell\nCounty to envision the tourism potential for miles of open land.\nJoined by Matt Bevin, then Kentucky\u2019s governor, and local politicians, Rogers pointed\nto the expanse of forestlands and mountaintops in the distance as he unveiled a $12.5\nmillion federal grant for the Appalachian Wildlife Center. Rogers, a Republican who\nrepresents the state\u2019s Appalachian region, had helped secure the money through the\nAbandoned Mine Land Pilot Program, a federal initiative designed to foster economic\ndevelopment around former coal mine sites in Kentucky and other states.\nThe proposed state-of-the-art facility would include a museum and local artisan market\nwhere visitors could learn about nature. The center\u2019s biggest attraction: the elk that\nroam the area.\nNearly four years after the announcement, and three years after the wildlife center was\nfirst supposed to be completed, the land is still largely untouched except for a few pens\nto hold elk and some water utility construction. The projected infusion of hundreds of\nthousands of tourists has not materialized. And Bell County residents, a third of whom\nlive in poverty and fewer than 1 in 10 of whom have a college degree, are still waiting\nfor an influx of jobs from yet another effort promising to help the area recover from the\ndecline of the coal industry.\nThe AML Pilot Program, created in 2015, is among the latest efforts that pledged to\nchange the fate of eastern Kentucky. State and federal leaders have directed hundreds\nof millions of dollars to the region over the past 50 years as part of multiple economic\nrevitalization efforts.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 136 Downtown Pineville, Kentucky, a small town in Bell County near the future site of the\nAppalachian Wildlife Center - By Stacy Kranitz special to ProPublica is licensed under\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\nThose investments have resulted in some improvements, including new hospitals and\nother health care facilities, job-training programs, and some businesses that have\ncome and stayed. But many projects haven\u2019t lived up to expectations, leaving residents\nwaiting for an economic lifeboat that never seems to arrive.\nSince its inception, the AML Pilot Program has awarded $105 million to 43 projects in\nthe state with little vetting. Some projects like the wildlife center have taken far longer\nto complete than promised, with no consequences. And lofty projections for job\ncreation, visitation and tourism revenue made by the wildlife center and other projects\nwent largely unchallenged by the state, the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting\nand ProPublica found.\nAn industrial park in Martin County was awarded $3.37 million in September 2019 even\nafter a consultant warned that the project had \u201cfatal flaws,\u201d including its location near a\nfederal prison. Two other industrial parks that received funding have already lost, or\nare at risk of losing, major businesses after pledging large numbers of jobs and related\neconomic growth.\nAnd a $2.5 million grant to Harlan Wood Products LLC in 2016 was tabled after the\ncompany was unable to obtain additional private funding. The Harlan County business,\nwhich is now dissolved according to the Kentucky secretary of state\u2019s office, had\nplanned to produce wood pellets for biomass fuel, employ up to 35 people and create\nabout 60 indirect jobs.\nFor the wildlife center, pledges of economic turnaround soared even as the projected\nopening date was repeatedly delayed. The center is now expected to open in June\n2022, according to the Appalachian Wildlife Foundation, the nonprofit organization that\nis responsible for its construction.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually building it. Nobody\u2019s ever done anything for tourism like we\u2019re doing,\u201d\nsaid David Ledford, president and CEO of the nonprofit foundation. He said project\ndelays have been primarily due to construction challenges on the reclaimed mine site\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 137 and a request by federal authorities for an additional environmental assessment. The\ncoronavirus pandemic also has pushed back construction, according to recent reports\nsubmitted to the state by the foundation.\nThe federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which oversees\nthe distribution of AML Pilot Program funding to states, did not respond to a request\nfor details about its application review process. But three officials familiar with the\nprocess, who aren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly, told KyCIR and ProPublica that the\nagency does no independent scrutiny of grant applicants\u2019 claims.\nState officials also could not provide KyCIR and ProPublica with records showing that\nthey verified the tourism and job projections. In fact, a committee appointed by the\nstate Energy and Environment Cabinet secretary has helped to dole out millions in\ntaxpayer dollars without maintaining any records of discussions or votes, as required\nfor public bodies, KyCIR and ProPublica found.\nThe committee, which helps determine how the program\u2019s federal tax dollars are spent,\nis not required to comply with state transparency laws, according to state officials who\nargue that it is not a public agency because it serves in an advisory capacity to the\ncabinet secretary.\nState and local programs across the country that offer incentives for economic\ndevelopment repeatedly come under scrutiny for failing to achieve job creation and\nrevenue benchmarks.\nThe AML Pilot Program falls within a gray area that sometimes escapes deeper\nexamination.\nThe federal government has gradually given states more decision-making authority\nover grant distribution and oversight, said Brett Theodos, a senior fellow and director\nof the community economic development hub at the Urban Institute in Washington,\nD.C.\nBut the AML Pilot Program stands out because the federal agency responsible for\ndistributing the funds does not appear to have provided clear parameters and\nmeasurements for success, he said.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 138 \u201cThe lack of expert decision-making, public meetings or outcome tracking makes (the\nAML Pilot Program) open for abuse,\u201d Theodos said.\nDisney-like Experience\nThe announcement on building the wildlife center came nearly two decades after the\nfailure of an industrial park project on the same site.\nThe state spent more than $10 million to buy the land, build a bridge over the\nCumberland River and run a three-lane, paved road up to the mountaintop, where the\nindustrial park would be located.\nBut no industry came. The park sat empty for more than a decade.\nThis sign is all that remains of a proposed industrial park. Nearly two decades later, the\nAppalachian Wildlife Center would choose to build on the same site - By Stacy Kranitz\nspecial to ProPublica is licensed under Creative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\nThen, in 2014, Ledford announced plans to construct the Appalachian Wildlife Center.\nAt the time, Ledford said he was considering five counties as potential locations for the\ncenter, which would be funded solely through private donations. The following year,\nLedford chose Bell County.\nLedford said in 2015 that the project, which would encompass 12,000 adjoining acres,\nwould draw 580,000 visitors and generate more than $113 million for the region in its\nfifth year in operation. \u201cWe will not seek any government funding for the project. It will\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 139 be funded thru private donations,\u201d Ledford said in a news release that projected a 2017\ncompletion date.\nAfter three years of operating at a net loss, the Appalachian Wildlife Foundation sought\nto bolster funds for the center by seeking an AML Pilot Program grant.\nIn an application filed in 2016 by the county, the foundation offered more ambitious\ntourism numbers than it had a year earlier. Not only would the center draw 638,000\nvisitors in its fifth year in operation, it would spur the creation of more than 2,000 jobs\nin the region.\nBy the time Rogers announced the AML Pilot Program funding later that year, the\nfoundation was projecting that the center would be complete in 2019.\nLedford did not respond to a request to explain why he sought government funding\nafter vowing not to do so. He has said that the state and federal governments vetted\nthe economic projections.\nBut hundreds of pages of federal and state documents related to the Appalachian\nWildlife Center project show no indication of any independent assessment or critical\nvetting by the state or the federal government of the tourism and job creation\nprojections. At least three federal documents, including a 2019 report, repeat almost\nverbatim the project application\u2019s claims for visitation, job creation and revenue\ngeneration.\nIn 2019, foundation leaders estimated that the center would open in June 2021. By its\nthird year, it would make $8.5 million after operating expenses, they said. The\nprojection was based on new estimates of 850,000 visitors annually, starting in its third\nyear, and average per visitor spending of $44 on admission fees, food and gift shop\nitems.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to build a first-class tourism destination and we\u2019re going to deliver a\nDisney-like experience,\u201d Frank Allen, a foundation board member, said during a\npresentation last year. \u201cI know it sounds ambitious and it is but, bear with me, at one\npoint so was Disney World. Ultimately, all you need is a great plan and a lot of money.\nWe\u2019ve got the plan and most of the money.\u201d\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 140 The Appalachian Wildlife Foundation\u2019s tourism projections exceeded by nearly 300,000\nthe number of visitors last year to western Kentucky\u2019s Mammoth Cave National Park,\none of the region\u2019s leading tourist attractions and home to the longest-known cave\nsystem in the world.\nLedford said the projections stem in part from his belief that the wildlife center will\ngenerate more visitors and revenue than the Keystone Elk Country Alliance in\nnorthwest Pennsylvania, which was created in 2009. The facility attracts more than\n481,000 people annually, according to its website.\nThe wildlife center hopes to capitalize on tourists traveling to other destinations,\nincluding resorts such as Pigeon Forge, a mountain town two hours away in eastern\nTennessee that is home to Dollywood, and Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, which\nis a seven-hour drive from Bell County. About 94% of the center\u2019s visitors would be\nfrom outside the state, according to the foundation\u2019s estimates.\n\u201cOur visitors are not going to spend three or four days here,\u201d Ledford said in an\ninterview. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end destination. It\u2019s a stop on the way to someplace.\u201d\nJeffrey Larkin, an Indiana University of Pennsylvania professor who teaches ecology\nand conservation, is skeptical that the wildlife center will be able to live up to its\nprojections.\n\u201cI would say that the challenges that lie before the Kentucky facility would be, \u2018If you\nbuild it, would they come?\u2019\u201d said Larkin, who received his master\u2019s and doctoral\ndegrees from the University of Kentucky and who once conducted fall elk tours in the\nAppalachian area of the state. \u201cIt\u2019s in a part of Kentucky that\u2019s not often visited by a lot\nof people.\u201d\nA New Program, Another Promise\nNestled in the southeastern corner of the state at the juncture with Virginia and\nTennessee, the land that would become Bell and Harlan counties was cemented in the\nregion\u2019s history when frontiersman Daniel Boone blazed a trail through the Cumberland\nGap in 1775.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 141 The counties also reflect in many ways the Appalachian region of which they are a part:\nThey are breathtakingly beautiful, largely rural, overwhelmingly white and significantly\npoor.\nThe remote counties, among 38 deemed economically distressed in eastern Kentucky,\nhave long wrestled with high poverty and unemployment rates. But a struggling coal\nindustry hastened economic contractions for rural communities in Appalachia.\nIn the past decade, coal production in the state\u2019s Appalachian region dropped from 67\nmillion tons to 13.6 million, forcing the elimination of most mining-related jobs, which\nplummeted from 13,000 in 2010 to 3,400 in 2019.\n\u201cCoal\u2019s hold over eastern Kentucky has long dampened creativity, long-term planning,\nalternative economic development, the ability to think in terms of the public good\nrather than personal gain and adequate taxes with which to support public\ninfrastructure and services,\u201d said Ronald D. Eller, former director of the Appalachian\nCenter at the University of Kentucky and a retired history professor.\nRogers, the politician who earned the nickname \u201cPrince of Pork\u201d because of his\nsuccess earmarking funding for his district, has been at the center of many of the\ninfusions of federal dollars for the region he represents. In June 2015, he chaired the\nU.S. House Appropriations Committee, which pushed for the AML Pilot Program as\npart of the U.S. Department of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill.\nLawmakers created a new pot of money, setting aside $90 million in 2016 to create\nnew job opportunities and stimulate the economies of Kentucky, Pennsylvania and\nWest Virginia by developing reclaimed mine sites. The program later expanded to\ninclude three additional states and three Native American tribes.\nThe federal government distributes the money but allows state officials to develop\ntheir own criteria for selecting the projects and monitoring their progress.\n\u201cThis is a thoughtful alternative to help hard-hit communities reinvigorate their\neconomies by using abandoned mine land to develop hospitals, community centers\nand much more,\u201d Rogers said in a June 2015 news release after his committee\u2019s\napproval.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 142 Rogers has since promoted the program as a key economic driver in Appalachia. In a\n2018 news release, he called it \u201cone of the most successful job creation and tourism\ninitiatives that we\u2019ve ever had in Eastern Kentucky.\u201d At the time, none of the projects\nhad been completed.\nRogers defended the money spent on various projects that have drawn limited results.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a silver bullet that can lift our region out of generational poverty, and none\nof our local officials who have applied for an AML grant believes that one project in an\nindustrial park or an exciting new tourism project will lift their county out of poverty,\u201d\nRogers said in an email.\nKentucky officials acknowledge that the state\u2019s oversight of the projects focuses on\nplanning and construction, not on expectations for economic development. Once\nconstruction is complete, state oversight largely ends, leaving no consistent\naccountability system for measuring whether the investments drew promised\neconomic changes to the area.\nJohn Mura, a spokesman for the state Energy and Environment Cabinet, said the\nadministration of Gov. Andy Beshear is committed to helping to improve the economy\nin coal communities and considers the AML Pilot Program an effective tool.\nWhile agreements with grantees do not clearly articulate oversight responsibilities\nonce projects are completed, Mura said the cabinet \u201cmay require that the grantee\ncontinue to submit an annual report on various metrics such as job creation.\u201d\n\u201cThis program has brought a good measure of economic vitality to eastern Kentucky in\nthe past four years and there is every expectation that under the Beshear\nadministration, it will continue to produce new jobs and new economic vitality in this\npart of the state,\u201d Mura said in an email. He did not respond to questions about which\ncircumstances might trigger the request for annual reports.\nMura pointed to two projects that he said have led to an additional 44 jobs in eastern\nKentucky.\nDajcor Aluminum, a business operating in the Coal Fields Regional Industrial Park in\nPerry County, has hired 31 employees since the county received a $6.5 million AML\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 143 Pilot Program grant in 2018 to buy equipment for the company. SilverLiner, a tanker\ntruck manufacturing company, also has hired 13 employees, Mura said. The company\nis located in Pike County, in the Kentucky Enterprise Industrial Park, which received a\n$5 million AML Pilot Program grant in 2016.\nA coal miner\u2019s flag hangs in the front yard of a home in Middlesboro, Kentucky - By\nStacy Kranitz special to ProPublica is licensed under Creative Commons License (CC\nBY-NC-ND 3.0)\nJames P. Ziliak, an economics professor at the University of Kentucky, said the eastern\npart of the state could be in worse shape without government investments such as the\nAML Pilot Program. But he worries about the lack of a broader strategy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a failure of economic development policy,\u201d Ziliak said. \u201cA lot has been\nspent, but has it been spent in the right places? And there have been a lot of empty\npromises over the years.\u201d\nBanking on Tourism\nThe Appalachian Wildlife Center is not the only tourism project in eastern Kentucky\nbanking on big promises to uplift the region.\nA Letcher County nonprofit, the EKY Heritage Foundation Inc., was awarded two AML\nPilot Program grants totaling nearly $3.5 million in 2018 and 2019 after promising to\ntransform more than 100 acres of \u201cstagnant land\u201d into Thunder Mountain, a \u201cworld-\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 144 class\u201d sport-shooting and archery resort park. The park would draw an estimated\n40,000 annual visitors, according to the nonprofit\u2019s application.\nThe completed project would employ 40 to 50 people and include shooting ranges,\ncampgrounds with cabins, an amphitheater and a training site for law enforcement and\nthe military.\nThe application offers no supporting evidence that Thunder Mountain could attract the\nnumber of tourists it projects. And while the application asserts that Thunder Mountain\nwould be a \u201cvaluable resource\u201d for personnel at a federal prison to be built in Letcher\nCounty, plans for construction of the prison were shelved last year.\nMissy Matthews, president of Childers Oil Co. and of Double Kwik, a chain of more than\n40 convenience stores and gas stations in the southeastern Kentucky region, formed\nthe nonprofit that proposed the project. She did not respond to interview requests.\nState Rep. Angie Hatton of Whitesburg, an EKY Heritage Foundation board member,\ndeclined to discuss claims for the project in detail. She provided a statement that she\nattributed to Sally Oakes, a Childers Oil Co. employee who served as the foundation\u2019s\ngrant writer.\n\u201cThe estimates in the grant application are based on various sources of information\nincluding reports, journals and magazines as well as communications with other\nowners\/operators of shooting ranges,\u201d the statement said. Oakes could not be reached\nfor comment.\nAbout 130 miles northeast of the proposed site for Thunder Mountain, another\ntourism- related project, in eastern Kentucky\u2019s Boyd County, received a $4 million AML\nPilot Program grant after pledging to double the number of visitors for an existing off-\nroad park.\nThe grant, awarded in 2017 to Boyd County government, would assist with water, sewer\nand road improvements intended to primarily benefit Rush Off-Road, a for-profit\nbusiness owned by E.B. Lowman III, who also is president of a real estate company in\neastern Kentucky.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 145 In its application, Boyd County government officials said the improvements would help\nthe park increase to 100,000 the number of visitors. It did not provide a timetable for\nthe increase and offered no evidence or documentation to support the claim.\nProject documents cite, but do not include, a market research study by Marshall\nUniversity in West Virginia, which Lowman said found that the park had a $5 million-\nplus economic impact on the county in 2017. Lowman declined to provide KyCIR and\nProPublica with a copy of the study, and university officials said they were unable to\nfind one.\nBoyd County officials did not respond to repeated requests from KyCIR and ProPublica\nto discuss the project. Federal and state officials did not reply to specific questions\nabout the project.\nShawna McCown said she struggles to understand how the four-wheelers roaring by\nher house in Rush, Kentucky, will help her or her neighbors.\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to help the community, but we don\u2019t see any benefit for us at\nall,\u201d McCown, a schoolteacher, said of the project. \u201cHow does that help me? I want a\ncommunity center, a library.\u201d\nResidents Left Waiting\nBy now, the Appalachian Wildlife Center, which has rebranded itself as Boone\u2019s Ridge,\nwas supposed to be pumping millions of dollars into Bell County. It was expected to\nhave created more than 1,000 direct and indirect jobs in the region, as many as the\ncounty\u2019s two largest employers combined: Smithfield Foods, which produces a variety\nof hams and smoked meats with 500 workers, and the Bell County school system,\nwhich has about 430 employees.\nInstead, a countdown clock on the project\u2019s website winds down to the most recent\nopening date: 593 days away.\nMeanwhile, Rome Meade, a 26-year-old who lives in the area, has for six months\nhunted for a full-time job without success.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 146 \u201cI believe it\u2019s gonna turn around,\u201d Meade said. \u201cAt least I hope so.\u201d\nHe\u2019s better off than some.

Franco\u2019s review of Johnson\u2019s \u201cSuperheroes in Crisis\u201d we find an examination of the\ncharacterization of two of the most consistently popular superheroes in American\npopular culture: Batman and Superman. In Franco\u2019s review of Johnson\u2019s text, we see a\nclear delineation of the often interpersonally combative characters. As Franco notes,\n\u201cSuperman [represents] (mostly) the moral standards of the conservative side of\nAmerican society, and Batman [explores] (mostly) the darker, subterranean side, both\nequally sustaining and fundamental to the American social fabric\u201d. Indeed, while\nSuperman is known for his adherence to \u201cTruth, Justice, and the American Way\u201d,\nBatman is often portrayed as a vigilante working outside the confines of the (often\ncorrupt) forces of Law and Order.\nIn \u201cAre Batman and Superman the Barometer of Our Times?\u201d, readers are given a\nsuccinct chronological exploration of the changes both characters undergo to fit in\nwith the ever-shifting requirements of the cultural zeitgeist. While more modern\nretellings have their own divergent interpretations of the motivations behind The Dark\nKnight and The Man of Steel (particularly in recent films \u00e0 la Nolan and Snyder), Franco\nshows us that this is nothing new. In fact, it is a demand of the continued endurance of\nthese characters that they must serve as a reflection of the changes in our own society\nand its constantly mutating requirements of what, if anything, really makes a hero a\nsuperhero.\nIntroduction by Fairleigh Roman\n#popculture #gender #sociology #history\nAre Batman and Superman the\nBarometer of Our Times? A Review of\nSuperheroes in Crisis\nIra Erika Franco\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 148 The idea that superhero comic books are part of a modern American mythology is\nprobably not a surprise to anyone. However, Jeffrey Johnson refocuses this concept\nin his monograph Superheroes in Crisis (RIT Press, 2014): after going into detail of the\nmyriad of changes Superman and Batman have gone to stay relevant, he suggests we\nshould narrow our assumptions of what constitutes a true comic book myth, given that\nthe character stays true to what the present society demands. \u2018American culture is\nlittered with faint remembrances of characters who flourished for a season and then\nbecame inconsequential and vanished\u2019 (Johnson 2014: 104). The author mentions The\nYellow Kid and Captain Marvel as those characters who were once \u00fcber famous and\npopular and now are but receding memories in people\u2019s minds. Avid comic readers can\nsurely think of many other examples of great modern characters who, for some reason,\njust didn\u2019t make it. Batman and Superman, however, remain \u2018two heroes who have\nsurvived, and often thrived, for over seventy years because they are important to\ncurrent Americans and speak to modern social problems and contemporary cultural\nnecessities\u2019 (Johnson 2014: 104).\nA noted World War II historian, Johnson points out that the characters have endured\nthe trials of time mainly because of their abilities to bend so as not to break. Even if\nmost of us modern readers assume fixed traits for both The Dark Knight and The Man\nof Steel, Johnson carefully demonstrates there\u2019s no such thing: Superman couldn\u2019t\neven fly in his earliest adventures, and through the period of the TV series in the mid-\nsixties, Batman, the so-called Dark Knight, was a goofy, campy character with not a bit\nof darkness in his soul. Through Johnson\u2019s account it is evident, though, that Batman\nand his creators have done a better job than Superman\u2019s in adjusting to radical\nchanges in American society (such as the US\u2019s disillusionment after JFK\u2019s\nassassination or the introduction of TV and its immediate popularity). This might also\nbe the reason for Batman\u2019s smoother translation to modern cinema: since the release\nof the first movie \u2014Batman (Burton, 1989)\u2014 has always kept the public interest with\nstrong sales figures, \u2014The Dark Knight (Nolan, 2008) being the most popular to date,\nhaving made 533 million dollars in revenue for its creators in the US alone \u2014. Not even\nthe bad Batman movies have flopped in opening weekends: people always want to see\nThe Dark Knight\u2019s new metamorphosis, as if they wanted to understand what they\u2019ve\nturned into.\nIn the four chapters of the book, Johnson provides the reader with the rare pleasure of\nbeing told old stories, gems actually: instead of just sociological analysis and high\nideas, Johnson provides the actual plot of the comic issue he chooses in order to\nsupport his commentary. We might remember that Superman was created during the\nGreat Depression (1938), and it\u2019s fairly easy to assume that the caped hero was to\nprovide a temporary escape for impoverished and desperate Americans, but unless we\nhave an infinite (and expensive) golden age collection, it would probably never occur to\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 149 us that during his first few years, Superman was actually a savior of the oppressed,\nalmost in a Marxist fashion. One example is Action Comics #3, where Superman\ndisguises himself as a coal miner to trap the mine owner and his socialite friends\nunderground in order to show them the importance of safety regulations and working\nmen. In Action Comics #8, Superman befriends a gang of delinquents and decides to\nburn down the slums they live in, just to prove that the government is partly responsible\nfor their delinquency. In the end, Superman becomes a true hero: he forces the\ngovernment to build new apartments providing these hooligans the dignity they\ndeserve. Throughout the book, Johnson provides such examples in effective ways to\nprove the Historic turmoil to which our heroes reacted.\nOne compelling topic that defines both characters concerns their enemies. At first,\nbeing created as depression-era social avengers, they fight the common criminal:\nshoplifters, wife-beaters and even politicians. \u2018These often colorful foes provided\naction and adventure while also creating a binary narrative of good and evil\u2019 (Johnson\n2014, XIV). But this narrative changes greatly throughout time, constituting probably\nthe most important transformation in the stories of these two heroes: the evolution of\ntheir foes. At some point, the duality of pure good and evil stops being good enough. It\nstops explaining what is wrong with the world. At the end of the sixties, for example,\nSuperman\u2019s petty villains become so unimportant that, for a while, his love interest Lois\nLane impersonates a new kind of foe. In a way, Lois updates better than Superman as\nshe wakes up to her newfound power, akin to the zeitgeist of her era. In Lois Lane #85\n(she even gets her own title for a little while) the one-time docile girlfriend decides she\nno longer wants to marry Superman and refuses his once longed-for offer. In a kind of\nconfused, first approach feminism, she is seen doing things such as lifting heavy stuff\nlike men. \u2018Superman represents the older generations and is pressing to protect the\nstatus quo, while Lois is a change-minded baby boomer\u2019 (Johnson 2014: 43).\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 150 Superman\u2019s Girlfriend, Lois Lane Vol 1 #80 by Curt Swan, Leo Dorfman, DC Comics\nlicensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\nBatman\u2019s enemies are, without a doubt, the most exciting ones. First of all, he gets one\nin the real world: he is accused of promoting homosexuality by the psychologist\nFrederic Werthan, in his book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), for which Americans\nchanged the regulation code of the comic book industry. Later, in the early sixties, the\ncharacter is handed to writer and editor Julius Schwartz and the stories become\nenriched with a focus on Batman\u2019s detective skills. The Riddler, Mr. Freeze and the\nJoker all demand The Caped Crusader\u2019s brainpower to discover complex noir plots,\ncreating a three-dimensional world within the comic\u2019s pages: \u2018Perhaps most interesting\nis Detective Comics#332 (October 1964) in which Batman fights Joker for the first time\nunder the new creative regime. In this story the Clown Prince of Crime creates a potent\ndust that causes anyone it comes in contact with to laugh uncontrollably. After\nencountering the drug, Batman researches possible cures and learns that a simple\nantihistamine will stop the uncontainable laughter. The Caped Crusader soon thwarts\nthe villain\u2019s evil plans and protects society from the psychopathic clown. This version\nof Batman is portrayed as being clearly more intelligent and cunning than his arch-\nnemesis, but The Joker is also more nefarious and crafty than he had been in recent\nappearances\u2019. (Johnson 2014, 36). It is only natural to think that Batman\u2019s foes evolve\nin complexity over time, the greatest example being a villain like Ra\u2019s al Ghul, who,\ndefying normal stereotyping, commits awful crimes believing it is best for the planet.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 151 In this constant reshaping of the characters, one thing remains constant from the\nbeginning: the foes are more metaphorical than the heroes for the darkest fears of\nAmerican society in the way they reflect the heroes\u2019 moral codes. In the first chapter,\nfor example, that covers the early years (from 1938 to 1959), most evildoers evoke the\ndesperate need of common people to keep America\u2019s status quo. Superman fights\nagainst gamblers taking control over football games and \u2018declares war on reckless\ndrivers\u2019. Superman deals with them using the moral code of an entire society: he enjoys\nhumiliating, beating and sometimes even killing them. \u2018These first superheroes were\nviolent champions for a hardened people who demanded they act in such a way. The\noriginal versions of Superman and Batman did not conform to the rules against killing,\nmaiming, battling authority figures and law enforcement\u2019 (Johnson 2014: XVII).\nJohnson thinks these initial times can be seen, especially in Superman, as a kind of an\nadolescence because of his disregard for any point of view except his own. More a\nbully than a hero, Superman reflects the state of millions of Americans, adult men out\nof work \u2018who had descended into hopelessness and Superman served as a bright spot\nin this bleak depressing age\u2019 (Johnson 2014: 2).\nJust three years later, with the entry of the US to World War II, the nature of both\ncriminals and heroes changed radically: both Batman and Superman had to support\ngovernmental and military mandates, slowly becoming in the years to come guardians\nof the conventional values that were established with the prosperity and the sense of\nsocial unity that came after the victory over the Axis armies. What happened to our\nheroes in the sixties reflected a harsh division in the American people: while Superman\nbecomes almost infected with paranoia and self-righteousness that characterized the\nconservatives in the post war era \u2014having nightmares of being exposed to red\nkryptonite, splitting into evil Superman and good Clark Kent, turning into a space\nmonster, among other adventures\u2014, Batman goes through some nice years of\ndetectivesque narrative, preparing for the blossoming of sexual liberation and anti-war\nmovements that would become popular among youngsters a few years later. \u2018The Dark\nKnight was now focusing more on his detective skills and was no longer fighting aliens\nor magical beings as he had in previous years\u2026Batman was attempting to recreate\nhimself from an evolving society, but it was unclear if a return to his detective roots\ncombined with pop art influences was what readers demanded\u2019 (Johnson 2014: 35).\nOne last thing is to note of this book: the detailed attention Johnson pays to the\ncreative minds that shaped these heroes. Bob Kane may have designed Batman to be a\n\u2018hardcore vigilante\u2019, but it was Julius Schwartz in 1964 who invented some of his most\nengaging traits as a resourceful hard-boiled detective with no other tools to fight crime\nbut his mind. Writers and artists like Frank Robbins, Bob Brown and Dick Giordano are\nmentioned as inventive, but Johnson points out a very short but fertile period in the\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 152 seventies that would prepare the dark and gothic traits of Batman we have come to\nlove, under the hands of writer Denny O\u2019Neal and artist Neal Adams. In this period\nBatman first gets his many layers as a character, his neurosis and most subtle\npsychological features that Frank Miller would use in his ground-breaking The Dark\nKnight Returns (1986), later revamped for Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight\u2019s Trilogy.\nAbove all, the great journey this book offers is discovering how our beloved heroes\nappear to be two ends of the same rope, because, paradoxically, even when they\nchange, they stay the same: Superman representing (mostly) the moral standards of\nthe conservative side of American society, and Batman exploring (mostly) the darker,\nsubterranean side, both equally sustaining and fundamental to the American social\nfabric.\nWorks Cited\nBatman (1989).

I am filled with wonder when I consider the\nimmeasurable contrast between the two lives which it connects. It was the third of\nMarch 1887, three months before I was seven years old.\nOn the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb, expectant. I guessed\nvaguely from my mother\u2019s signs and from the hurrying to and fro in the house that\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 163 something unusual was about to happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps.\nThe afternoon sun penetrated the mass of honeysuckle that covered the porch and fell\non my upturned face. My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the familiar leaves\nand blossoms which had just come forth to greet the sweet southern spring. I did not\nknow what the future held of marvel or surprise for me. Anger and bitterness had\npreyed upon me continually for weeks and a deep languor had succeeded this\npassionate struggle.\nHave you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white\ndarkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the\nshore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for\nsomething to happen? I was like that ship before my education began, only I was\nwithout compass or sounding-line and had no way of knowing how near the harbor\nwas. \u201cLight! Give me light!\u201d was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone\non me in that very hour.\nI felt approaching footsteps. I stretched out my hand as I supposed to my mother.\nSomeone took it, and I was caught up and held close in the arms of her who had come\nto reveal all things to me, and, more than all things else, to love me.\nThe morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me a doll. The\nlittle blind children at the Perkins Institution had sent it and Laura Bridgman had\ndressed it; but I did not know this until afterward. When I had played with it a little\nwhile, Miss Sullivan slowly spelled into my hand the word \u201cd-o-l-l.\u201d I was at once\ninterested in this finger play and tried to imitate it. When I finally succeeded in making\nthe letters correctly , I was flushed with childish pleasure and pride. Running\ndownstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made the letters for doll. I did not know\nthat I was spelling a word or even that words existed; I was simply making my fingers\ngo in monkeylike imitation. In the days that followed I learned to spell in this\nuncomprehending way a great many words, among them pin, hat, cup and few verbs\nlike sit, stand and walk. But my teacher had been with me several weeks before I\nunderstood that everything has a name.\nOne day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my\nlap also, spelled \u201cd-o-l-l\u201d applied to both. Earlier in the day we had had a tussle over the\nwords \u201cm-u-g\u201d and \u201cw-a-t-e-r.\u201d Miss Sullivan had tried to impress it upon me that \u201cm-u-\ng\u201d is mug and that \u201cw-a-t-e-r\u201d is water, but I persisted in confounding the two. In\ndespair she had dropped the subject for the time, only to renew it at the first\nopportunity. I became impatient at her repeated attempts and, seizing the new doll, I\ndashed it upon the floor. I was keenly delighted when I felt the fragments of the broken\ndoll at my feet. Neither sorrow nor regret followed my passionate outburst. I had not\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 164 loved the doll. In the still, dark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment or\ntenderness. I felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of the hearth, and I had a\nsense of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfort was removed. She brought me\nmy hat, and I knew I was going out into the sunshine. This thought, if a wordless\nsensation may be called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.\nWe walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the fragrance of the\nhoneysuckle with which it was covered. Someone was drawing water and my teacher\nplaced my hand under the spout. As a cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled\ninto the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention\nfixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of\nsomething forgotten\u2014a thrill of returning thought, and somehow the mystery of\nlanguage was revealed to me. I knew then that \u201cw-a-t-e-r\u201d meant the wonderful cool\nsomething that was flowing over my hand. The living word awakened my soul, gave it\nlight, hope, joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that could in\ntime be swept away.\nI left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth\nto a new thought. As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to\nquiver with life. That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had\ncome to me. On entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way to\nthe hearth and picked up the pieces. I tried vainly to put them together. Then my eyes\nfilled with tears; for I realized what I had done, and for the first time I felt repentance\nand sorrow.\nI learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I\ndo know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among them\u2014words that were to\nmake the world blossom for me, \u201clike Aaron\u2019s rod, with flowers.\u201d It would have been\ndifficult to find a happier child than I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful\nday and lived over the joys it had brought me, for the first time longed for a new day to\ncome.\nThe Day Language Came into My Life by Helen Keller is licensed under Public Domain:\nNo Known Copyright\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 165 This archive video footage from 1928 features one of the only recorded exchanges\nexisting between teacher Anne Sullivan and author Helen Keller.

As Mednick suggests, Gardner\u2019s key insight was that, in the United States, our\ntraditional education system has long valued only the first two kinds of intelligence\u2014\nLinguistic and Logical-Mathematical\u2014while ignoring or marginalizing the rest. Because\nof this, a student might, for example, be extremely gifted at imagining spatial\nrelationships between objects, while another student might be a genius at empathizing\nwith other people; but if either student did not also have Linguistic or Logical-\nMathematical aptitudes, they would run the risk of being labeled \u201cremedial\u201d or\n\u201cproblem\u201d students. Moreover, Mednick points out, subsequent studies have proposed\nmany more kinds of intelligence beyond Gardner\u2019s original seven, suggesting the\nongoing need for educators and employers to recognize the full range of diverse\ntalents that individuals might have.\nMednick\u2019s article is a great example of an informative essay written in the style of an\noverview. He starts with one authoritative source\u2014Gardner\u2019s Frames of Mind\u2014and then\ntalks about the implications and potential problems with that source. He then goes on\nto cite more recent studies\u2014including those by Daniel Goleman and the National\nCenter for Clinical Infant Programs\u2014and to integrate their assertions into the earlier\nwork by Gardner. Throughout the article, Mednick uses a combination of\nstraightforward language and formatting techniques like tables, bulleted lists, and\nsubheadings in order to make his subject accessible to as wide an audience as\npossible.\nIntroduction by Gerald Nachtwey\n#literacy #sociology #research\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 168 Multiple Intelligences\nFred Mednick\nIs intelligence innate? Genetic? Fixed?\nGenerally, this is how intelligence has been viewed \u2013 as a quantity. Recently, new views\nhave emerged with enormous implications for education. This new perspective asserts\nthat intelligence can be measured in different ways, that it grows, and it is more quality\nthan quantity. It used to be that the question was asked: \u201cIs s\/he smart?\u201d New\nquestions now ask: \u201d How is s\/he smart?\u201d The emphasis is on the various ways in\nwhich we demonstrate multiple intelligences, rather than a single intelligence. The\nreadings and assignments that follow discuss multiple intelligences, provide an\nopportunity for you to apply them, and a way of determining how to assess students.\nHoward Gardner created a list of seven intelligences. The first two are ones that have\nbeen typically valued in schools; the next three are usually associated with the arts; and\nthe final two are what Howard Gardner called \u201cpersonal intelligences.\u201d\nLinguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written language, the ability to\nlearn languages, and the capacity to use language to accomplish certain goals. This\nintelligence includes the ability to effectively use language to express oneself\nrhetorically or poetically, and language as a means to remembering information.\nWriters, poets, lawyers, and speakers are among those that Howard Gardner sees as\nhaving high linguistic intelligence.\nLogical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to analyze problems\nlogically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically. In\nHoward Gardner\u2019s words, it entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively,\nand think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with scientific and\nmathematical thinking.\nMusical intelligence involves skill in the performance, composition, and appreciation of\nmusical patterns. It encompasses the capacity to recognize and compose musical\npitches, tones, and rhythms. According to Howard Gardner musical intelligence runs in\nan almost structural parallel to linguistic intelligence.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 169 Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence entails the potential of using one\u2019s whole body or parts\nof the body to solve problems. It is the ability to use mental abilities to coordinate\nbodily movements. Howard Gardner sees mental and physical activity as related.\nSpatial intelligence involves the potential to recognize and use the patterns of wide\nspace and more confined areas.\nInterpersonal intelligence is concerned with the capacity to understand the intentions,\nmotivations, and desires of other people. It allows people to work effectively with\nothers. Educators, salespeople, religious and political leaders and counselors all need\na well-developed interpersonal intelligence.\nIntrapersonal intelligence entails the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate\none\u2019s feelings, fears and motivations. In Howard Gardner\u2019s view it involves having an\neffective working model of ourselves, and to be able to use such information to\nregulate our lives.\nIn Frames of Mind Howard Gardner treated the personal intelligences \u201cas a piece.\u201d\nBecause of their close association in most cultures, they are often linked together.\nHowever, he still argues that it makes sense to think of two forms of personal\nintelligence. Gardner claimed that the seven intelligences rarely operate independently.\nThey are used at the same time and tend to complement each other as people develop\nskills or solve problems.\nIn essence, Howard Gardner argues that he was making two essential claims about\nmultiple intelligences:\nThe theory is an account of human cognition in its fullness. The intelligences\nprovided \u201ca new definition of human nature, cognitively speaking\u201d (Gardner\n1999: 44). Human beings are organisms who possess a basic set of\nintelligences.\nPeople have a unique blend of intelligences. Gardner argues that the big challenge\nfacing the deployment of human resources \u201cis how to best take advantage of the\nuniqueness conferred on us as a species exhibiting several intelligences.\u201d\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 170 Also, these intelligences, according to Howard Gardner, are amoral \u2013 they can be put to\nconstructive or destructive use.\nThe Appeal of Multiple Intelligences\nHoward Gardner\u2019s theory of multiple intelligences has not been readily accepted within\nacademic psychology. However, it has met with a strong positive response from many\neducators. It has been embraced by a range of educational theorists, and, significantly,\napplied by teachers and policymakers to the challenges of schooling. A number of\nschools have looked to structure curricula according to the intelligences, and to design\nclassrooms and even whole schools to reflect the understandings that Howard Gardner\ndevelops. The theory can also be found in use within pre-school, higher, vocational, and\nadult-education initiatives.\nThis appeal was not, at first, obvious.\nAt first, this diagnosis would appear to sound a \u201cdeath knell\u201d for formal education. It is\nhard to teach one intelligence; what if there are seven? It is hard to enough to teach\neven when anything can be taught; what to do if there are distinct limits and strong\nconstraints on human cognition and learning?\nHoward Gardner responds to these questions by first making the point that psychology\ndoes not directly dictate education, \u201cIt merely helps one to understand the conditions\nwithin which education takes place.\u201d Even more: Seven kinds of intelligence would\nallow seven ways to teach, rather than one. In addition, paradoxically, constraints can\nbe suggestive and ultimately freeing.\nMindy L. Kornhaber, a researcher at Harvard University, has identified a number of\nreasons why teachers and policymakers have responded positively to Howard\nGardner\u2019s presentation of multiple intelligences. Among these are the fact that the\ntheory validates educators\u2019 everyday experience: students think and learn in many\ndifferent ways. It also provides educators with a conceptual framework for organizing\nand reflecting on curriculum assessment and pedagogical practices. In turn, this\nreflection has led many educators to develop new approaches that might better meet\nthe needs of the range of learners in their classrooms.\nSome issues and problems\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 171 As with all theories in education, multiple intelligences theory has its critics. Some\nmaintain that longitudinal studies still bear out the power of genetics and intelligence\nas a fixed quantity. They argue that this theory apologizes for lack of intellectual\nachievement. Others argue that the ability to measure or test for such intelligences\nundermines its core assertions. In short, such critics claim: \u201cIf you can\u2019t test it, it\u2019s not\nvalid.\u201d\nDr. Gardner contests such claims of validity by arguing for a different view of\nstandardized testing that is not biased in favor of only one kind of intelligence at the\nexpense of others. He also notes the achievements of students in non-academic\nsettings and the tragedy of exclusion that results when whole segments of the\npopulation are not served because their intelligences do not have the opportunity for\nexpression.\nImplications of Multiple Intelligences for Schools\nIn terms of Culture it means support for diverse learners and hard work; acting on a\nvalue system that maintains that diverse students can learn and succeed; that learning\nis exciting; and that hard work by teachers is necessary.\nIn terms of Readiness it means awareness-building for implementing multiple\nintelligences. Building staff awareness of multiple intelligences and of the different\nways that students learn.\nRather than using the theory as an end in and of itself, multiple intelligences can be\nused as a Tool to promote high-quality student work\nIt can foster Collaboration \u2013 informal and formal exchanges \u2013 sharing ideas and\nconstructive suggestions by the staff.\nIt allows for Choice \u2013 meaningful curriculum and assessment options; embedding\ncurriculum and assessment in activities that are valued both by students and the wider\nculture.\nIt employs the Arts to develop children\u2019s skills and understanding within and across\ndisciplines.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 172 Inventory of Your Intelligences\nBelow you will see a list of intelligences as defined on Lessons for Hope:\nMultiple Overview\nIntelligences\nVerbal-Linguistic \u2013 The Learns from the spoken and\ncapacity to learn through written word, in many forms;\nwords and grammatical logic reads, comprehends, and\nsummarizes effectively\nLogical-Mathematical \u2013 The Learns through using\ncapacity for inductive and objects and moving them\ndeductive thinking and about, quantity, time, cause\nreasoning, as well as the use and effect; solves problems\nof numbers and the logically; understands\nrecognition of abstract patterns and relationships\npatterns and makes educated\nguesses; can handle diverse\nskills such as advanced\nmath, and represent them in\ngraphic form; works with\nmodels; gathers evidence;\nbuilds strong arguments.\nVisual-Spatial \u2013 The ability Learns by seeing and\nto visualize objects and observing \u2013 shapes, faces,\nspatial dimensions, and colors; uses detail in visual\ncreate internal images and images; learns through\npictures visual media; enjoys\ndoodling, drawing; makes\nthree-dimensional objects\nand moves them around;\nsees forms where others do\nnot; enjoys abstractions and\nsubtle patterns.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 173 Body-Kinesthetic \u2013 The Learns through touching\nwisdom of the body and the and moving; developed\nability to control physical coordination and timing;\nmotion participation and\ninvolvement; role plays.\nEngages in games,\nassembles objects; acts.\nSensitive to physical\nenvironment; dexterity and\nbalance; creates new forms\nthat move.\nMusical-Rhythmic \u2013 The Learns through sound;\nability to recognize tonal eager to discuss music and\npatterns and sounds, as well its meaning; sings and plays\nas a sensitivity to rhythms an instrument; improvises\nand beats and interprets\nInterpersonal \u2013 The capacity Learns through interactions,\nfor person-to-person social relationships;\ncommunications and perceives feelings,\nrelationships thoughts, motivations of\nothers; collaborates;\ninfluences opinions;\nunderstands in verbal and\nnon-verbal ways; takes in\ndiverse points of view;\nmediates, organizes,\ndevelops new social\nprocesses and methods.\nIntrapersonal \u2013 The spiritual, Learns through range of\ninner states of being, self- personal emotions; finds\nreflection, and awareness outlets for feelings;\nidentifies and pursues\npersonal goals; curious\nabout big questions;\nmanages to learn through\non-going attempts at\ngathering in ideas;\ninsightful; empowers others.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 174 Additional Intelligences\nSince Howard Gardner\u2019s original listing of the intelligences in Frames of Mind (1983)\nthere has been a great deal of discussion as to other possible candidates for inclusion\n\u2013 naturalistic intelligence (the ability of people to draw upon the resources and\nfeatures of the environment to solve problems); spiritual intelligence (the ability of\npeople to both access and use, practically, the resources available in somewhat less\ntangible, but nonetheless powerful lessons of the spirit); moral intelligence (the ability\nto access and use certain truths).\nEmotional Intelligence\nIn a 1994 report on the current state of emotional literacy in the U.S., author Daniel\nGoleman stated:\n\u201c\u2026in navigating our lives, it is our fears and envies, our rages and depressions,\nour worries and anxieties that steer us day to day. Even the most academically\nbrilliant among us are vulnerable to being undone by unruly emotions. The price\nwe pay for emotional literacy is in failed marriages and troubled families, in\nstunted social and work lives, in deteriorating physical health and mental\nanguish and, as a society, in tragedies such as killings\u2026\u201d\nGoleman attests that the best remedy for battling our emotional shortcomings is\npreventive medicine. In other words, we need to place as much importance on teaching\nour children the essential skills of Emotional Intelligence as we do on more traditional\nmeasures like IQ and GPA (Grade Point Avergaes).\nExactly what is Emotional Intelligence? The term encompasses the following 5 five\ncharacteristics and abilities:\n\u2022 Self-awareness \u2013 knowing your emotions, recognizing feelings as they occur,\nand discriminating between them.\n\u2022 Mood management \u2013 handling feelings so they\u2019re relevant to the current\nsituation and you react appropriately.\n\u2022 Self-motivation \u2013 \u201cgathering up\u201d your feelings and directing yourself towards a\ngoal, despite self-doubt, inertia, and impulsiveness.\n\u2022 Empathy \u2013 recognizing feelings in others and tuning into their verbal and\nnonverbal cues.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 175 \u2022 Managing relationships \u2013 handling interpersonal interaction, conflict resolution,\nand negotiations.\nWhy We Need Emotional Intelligence\nResearch in brain-based learning suggests that emotional health is fundamental to\neffective learning. According to a report from the National Center for Clinical Infant\nPrograms, the most critical element for a student\u2019s success in school is an\nunderstanding of how to learn. (Emotional Intelligence, p. 193.) The key ingredients for\nthis understanding are:\n\u2022 Confidence\n\u2022 Curiosity\n\u2022 Intentionality\n\u2022 Self-control\n\u2022 Relatedness\n\u2022 Capacity to communicate\n\u2022 Ability to cooperate\nThese traits are all aspects of Emotional Intelligence. Basically, a student who learns to\nlearn is much more apt to succeed. Emotional Intelligence has proven a better\npredictor of future success than traditional methods like the GPA, IQ, and standardized\ntest scores.\nHence, the great interest in Emotional Intelligence on the part of corporations,\nuniversities, and schools nationwide. The idea of Emotional Intelligence has inspired\nresearch and curriculum development. Researchers have concluded that people who\nmanage their own feelings well and deal effectively with others are more likely to live\ncontent lives. Plus, happy people are more apt to retain information and do so more\neffectively than dissatisfied people.\nBuilding one\u2019s Emotional Intelligence has a lifelong impact. Many parents and\neducators, alarmed by increasing levels of conflict in young schoolchildren \u2013 from low\nself-esteem to early drug and alcohol use to depression \u2013 are rushing to teach\nstudents the skills necessary for Emotional Intelligence. Also, in corporations, the\ninclusion of Emotional Intelligence in training programs has helped employees\ncooperate better and be more motivated, thereby increasing productivity and profits.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 176 \u201cEmotional Intelligence is a master aptitude, a capacity that profoundly affects all other\nabilities, either facilitating or interfering with them.\u201d (Daniel Goleman, Emotional\nIntelligence, p. 80.)\nMultiple Intelligences by Fred Mednick is licensed under a CC BY: Attribution\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 177 \u201cK-Pop\u2014What\u2019s in a Name?\u201d is an interactive, multimedia roundtable conversation\npresented by the Rhizomatic Revolution Review.

THE LAND OF RED APPLES.\nThere were eight in our party of bronzed children who were going East with the\nmissionaries. Among us were three young braves, two tall girls, and we three little\nones, Jud\u00e9win, Thowin, and I. We had been very impatient to start on our journey to the\nRed Apple Country, which, we were told, lay a little beyond the great circular horizon of\nthe Western prairie. Under a sky of rosy apples we dreamt of roaming as freely and\nhappily as we had chased the cloud shadows on the Dakota plains. We had anticipated\nmuch pleasure from a ride on the iron horse, but the throngs of staring palefaces\ndisturbed and troubled us. On the train, fair women, with tottering babies on each arm,\nstopped their haste and scrutinized the children of absent mothers. Large men, with\nheavy bundles in their hands, halted near by, and riveted their glassy blue eyes upon us.\nI sank deep into the corner of my seat, for I resented being watched. Directly in front of\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 181 me, children who were no larger than I hung themselves upon the backs of their seats,\nwith their bold white faces toward me. Sometimes they took their forefingers out of\ntheir mouths and pointed at my moccasined feet. Their mothers, instead of reproving\nsuch rude curiosity, looked closely at me, and attracted their children\u2019s further notice to\nmy blanket. This embarrassed me, and kept me constantly on the verge of tears.\nI sat perfectly still, with my eyes downcast, daring only now and then to shoot long\nglances around me. Chancing to turn to the window at my side, I was quite breathless\nupon seeing one familiar object. It was the telegraph pole which strode by at short\npaces. Very near my mother\u2019s dwelling, along the edge of a road thickly bordered with\nwild sunflowers, some poles like these had been planted by white men. Often I had\nstopped, on my way down the road, to hold my ear against the pole, and, hearing its low\nmoaning, I used to wonder what the paleface had done to hurt it. Now I sat watching for\neach pole that glided by to be the last one.\nIn this way I had forgotten my uncomfortable surroundings, when I heard one of my\ncomrades call out my name. I saw the missionary standing very near, tossing candies\nand gums into our midst. This amused us all, and we tried to see who could catch the\nmost of the sweetmeats.\nThough we rode several days inside of the iron horse, I do not recall a single thing\nabout our luncheons.\nIt was night when we reached the school grounds. The lights from the windows of the\nlarge buildings fell upon some of the icicled trees that stood beneath them. We were\nled toward an open door, where the brightness of the lights within flooded out over the\nheads of the excited palefaces who blocked our way. My body trembled more from fear\nthan from the snow I trod upon.\nEntering the house, I stood close against the wall. The strong glaring light in the large\nwhitewashed room dazzled my eyes. The noisy hurrying of hard shoes upon a bare\nwooden floor increased the whirring in my ears. My only safety seemed to be in\nkeeping next to the wall. As I was wondering in which direction to escape from all this\nconfusion, two warm hands grasped me firmly, and in the same moment I was tossed\nhigh in midair. A rosy-cheeked paleface woman caught me in her arms. I was both\nfrightened and insulted by such trifling. I stared into her eyes, wishing her to let me\nstand on my own feet, but she jumped me up and down with increasing enthusiasm.\nMy mother had never made a plaything of her wee daughter. Remembering this I began\nto cry aloud.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 182 They misunderstood the cause of my tears, and placed me at a white table loaded with\nfood. There our party were united again. As I did not hush my crying, one of the older\nones whispered to me, \u201cWait until you are alone in the night.\u201d\nIt was very little I could swallow besides my sobs, that evening.\n\u201cOh, I want my mother and my brother Daw\u00e9e! I want to go to my aunt!\u201d I pleaded; but\nthe ears of the palefaces could not hear me.\nFrom the table we were taken along an upward incline of wooden boxes, which I\nlearned afterward to call a stairway. At the top was a quiet hall, dimly lighted. Many\nnarrow beds were in one straight line down the entire length of the wall. In them lay\nsleeping brown faces, which peeped just out of the coverings. I was tucked into bed\nwith one of the tall girls, because she talked to me in my mother tongue and seemed to\nsoothe me.\nI had arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies, but I was not happy, as I had thought I\nshould be. My long travel and the bewildering sights had exhausted me. I fell asleep,\nheaving deep, tired sobs. My tears were left to dry themselves in streaks, because\nneither my aunt nor my mother was near to wipe them away.\nII. THE CUTTING OF MY LONG HAIR.\nThe first day in the land of apples was a bitter-cold one; for the snow still covered the\nground, and the trees were bare. A large bell rang for breakfast, its loud metallic voice\ncrashing through the belfry overhead and into our sensitive ears. The annoying clatter\nof shoes on bare floors gave us no peace. The constant clash of harsh noises, with an\nundercurrent of many voices murmuring an unknown tongue, made a bedlam within\nwhich I was securely tied. And though my spirit tore itself in struggling for its lost\nfreedom, all was useless.\nA paleface woman, with white hair, came up after us. We were placed in a line of girls\nwho were marching into the dining room. These were Indian girls, in stiff shoes and\nclosely clinging dresses. The small girls wore sleeved aprons and shingled hair. As I\nwalked noiselessly in my soft moccasins, I felt like sinking to the floor, for my blanket\nhad been stripped from my shoulders. I looked hard at the Indian girls, who seemed not\nto care that they were even more immodestly dressed than I, in their tightly fitting\nclothes. While we marched in, the boys entered at an opposite door. I watched for the\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 183 three young braves who came in our party. I spied them in the rear ranks, looking as\nuncomfortable as I felt. A small bell was tapped, and each of the pupils drew a chair\nfrom under the table. Supposing this act meant they were to be seated, I pulled out\nmine and at once slipped into it from one side. But when I turned my head, I saw that I\nwas the only one seated, and all the rest at our table remained standing. Just as I\nbegan to rise, looking shyly around to see how chairs were to be used, a second bell\nwas sounded. All were seated at last, and I had to crawl back into my chair again. I\nheard a man\u2019s voice at one end of the hall, and I looked around to see him. But all the\nothers hung their heads over their plates. As I glanced at the long chain of tables, I\ncaught the eyes of a paleface woman upon me. Immediately I dropped my eyes,\nwondering why I was so keenly watched by the strange woman. The man ceased his\nmutterings, and then a third bell was tapped. Every one picked up his knife and fork and\nbegan eating. I began crying instead, for by this time I was afraid to venture anything\nmore.\nBut this eating by formula was not the hardest trial in that first day. Late in the morning,\nmy friend Jud\u00e9win gave me a terrible warning. Jud\u00e9win knew a few words of English;\nand she had overheard the paleface woman talk about cutting our long, heavy hair. Our\nmothers had taught us that only unskilled warriors who were captured had their hair\nshingled by the enemy. Among our people, short hair was worn by mourners, and\nshingled hair by cowards!\nWe discussed our fate some moments, and when Jud\u00e9win said, \u201cWe have to submit,\nbecause they are strong,\u201d I rebelled.\n\u201cNo, I will not submit! I will struggle first!\u201d I answered.\nI watched my chance, and when no one noticed, I disappeared. I crept up the stairs as\nquietly as I could in my squeaking shoes,\u2014my moccasins had been exchanged for\nshoes. Along the hall I passed, without knowing whither I was going. Turning aside to\nan open door, I found a large room with three white beds in it. The windows were\ncovered with dark green curtains, which made the room very dim. Thankful that no one\nwas there, I directed my steps toward the corner farthest from the door. On my hands\nand knees I crawled under the bed, and cuddled myself in the dark corner.\nFrom my hiding place I peered out, shuddering with fear whenever I heard footsteps\nnear by. Though in the hall loud voices were calling my name, and I knew that even\nJud\u00e9win was searching for me, I did not open my mouth to answer. Then the steps\nwere quickened and the voices became excited. The sounds came nearer and nearer.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 184 Women and girls entered the room. I held my breath and watched them open closet\ndoors and peep behind large trunks. Some one threw up the curtains, and the room was\nfilled with sudden light. What caused them to stoop and look under the bed I do not\nknow. I remember being dragged out, though I resisted by kicking and scratching\nwildly. In spite of myself, I was carried downstairs and tied fast in a chair.\nI cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the cold blades of the scissors\nagainst my neck, and heard them gnaw off one of my thick braids. Then I lost my spirit.\nSince the day I was taken from my mother I had suffered extreme indignities. People\nhad stared at me. I had been tossed about in the air like a wooden puppet. And now my\nlong hair was shingled like a coward\u2019s! In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no\none came to comfort me. Not a soul reasoned quietly with me, as my own mother used\nto do; for now I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder.\nIII. THE SNOW EPISODE.\nA short time after our arrival we three Dakotas were playing in the snowdrift. We were\nall still deaf to the English language, excepting Jud\u00e9win, who always heard such\npuzzling things. One morning we learned through her ears that we were forbidden to\nfall lengthwise in the snow, as we had been doing, to see our own impressions.\nHowever, before many hours we had forgotten the order, and were having great sport in\nthe snow, when a shrill voice called us. Looking up, we saw an imperative hand\nbeckoning us into the house. We shook the snow off ourselves, and started toward the\nwoman as slowly as we dared.\nJud\u00e9win said: \u201cNow the paleface is angry with us. She is going to punish us for falling\ninto the snow. If she looks straight into your eyes and talks loudly, you must wait until\nshe stops. Then, after a tiny pause, say, \u2018No.'\u201d The rest of the way we practiced upon\nthe little word \u201cno.\u201d\nAs it happened, Thowin was summoned to judgment first. The door shut behind her\nwith a click.\nJud\u00e9win and I stood silently listening at the keyhole. The paleface woman talked in\nvery severe tones. Her words fell from her lips like crackling embers, and her inflection\nran up like the small end of a switch. I understood her voice better than the things she\nwas saying. I was certain we had made her very impatient with us. Jud\u00e9win heard\nenough of the words to realize all too late that she had taught us the wrong reply.\n\u201cOh, poor Thowin!\u201d she gasped, as she put both hands over her ears.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 185 Just then I heard Thowin\u2019s tremulous answer, \u201cNo.\u201d\nWith an angry exclamation, the woman gave her a hard spanking. Then she stopped to\nsay something.\nJud\u00e9win said it was this: \u201cAre you going to obey my word the next time?\u201d\nThowin answered again with the only word at her command, \u201cNo.\u201d\nThis time the woman meant her blows to smart, for the poor frightened girl shrieked at\nthe top of her voice. In the midst of the whipping the blows ceased abruptly, and the\nwoman asked another question: \u201cAre you going to fall in the snow again?\u201d\nThowin gave her bad passwood another trial. We heard her say feebly, \u201cNo! No!\u201d\nWith this the woman hid away her half-worn slipper, and led the child out, stroking her\nblack shorn head. Perhaps it occurred to her that brute force is not the solution for\nsuch a problem. She did nothing to Jud\u00e9win nor to me. She only returned to us our\nunhappy comrade, and left us alone in the room.\nDuring the first two or three seasons misunderstandings as ridiculous as this one of\nthe snow episode frequently took place, bringing unjustifiable frights and punishments\ninto our little lives.\nWithin a year I was able to express myself somewhat in broken English. As soon as I\ncomprehended a part of what was said and done, a mischievous spirit of revenge\npossessed me. One day I was called in from my play for some misconduct. I had\ndisregarded a rule which seemed to me very needlessly binding. I was sent into the\nkitchen to mash the turnips for dinner. It was noon, and steaming dishes were hastily\ncarried into the dining-room. I hated turnips, and their odor which came from the brown\njar was offensive to me.\nWith fire in my heart, I took the wooden tool that the paleface woman held out to me. I\nstood upon a step, and, grasping the handle with both hands, I bent in hot rage over the\nturnips. I worked my vengeance upon them. All were so busily occupied that no one\nnoticed me. I saw that the turnips were in a pulp, and that further beating could not\nimprove them; but the order was, \u201cMash these turnips,\u201d and mash them I would! I\nrenewed my energy; and as I sent the masher into the bottom of the jar, I felt a\nsatisfying sensation that the weight of my body had gone into it.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 186 Just here a paleface woman came up to my table. As she looked into the jar, she\nshoved my hands roughly aside. I stood fearless and angry. She placed her red hands\nupon the rim of the jar. Then she gave one lift and stride away from the table. But lo!\nthe pulpy contents fell through the crumbled bottom to the floor I She spared me no\nscolding phrases that I had earned. I did not heed them. I felt triumphant in my revenge,\nthough deep within me I was a wee bit sorry to have broken the jar.\nAs I sat eating my dinner, and saw that no turnips were served, I whooped in my heart\nfor having once asserted the rebellion within me.\nIV. THE DEVIL.\nAmong the legends the old warriors used to tell me were many stories of evil spirits.\nBut I was taught to fear them no more than those who stalked about in material guise. I\nnever knew there was an insolent chieftain among the bad spirits, who dared to array\nhis forces against the Great Spirit, until I heard this white man\u2019s legend from a paleface\nwoman.\nOut of a large book she showed me a picture of the white man\u2019s devil. I looked in horror\nupon the strong claws that grew out of his fur-covered fingers. His feet were like his\nhands. Trailing at his heels was a scaly tail tipped with a serpent\u2019s open jaws. His face\nwas a patchwork: he had bearded cheeks, like some I had seen palefaces wear; his\nnose was an eagle\u2019s bill, and his sharp-pointed ears were pricked up like those of a sly\nfox. Above them a pair of cow\u2019s horns curved upward. I trembled with awe, and my\nheart throbbed in my throat, as I looked at the king of evil spirits. Then I heard the\npaleface woman say that this terrible creature roamed loose in the world, and that little\ngirls who disobeyed school regulations were to be tortured by him.\nThat night I dreamt about this evil divinity. Once again I seemed to be in my mother\u2019s\ncottage. An Indian woman had come to visit my mother. On opposite sides of the\nkitchen stove, which stood in the center of the small house, my mother and her guest\nwere seated in straight-backed chairs. I played with a train of empty spools hitched\ntogether on a string. It was night, and the wick burned feebly. Suddenly I heard some\none turn our door-knob from without. My mother and the woman hushed their talk, and\nboth looked toward the door. It opened gradually. I waited behind the stove. The hinges\nsqueaked as the door was slowly, very slowly pushed inward.\nThen in rushed the devil! He was tall! He looked exactly like the picture I had seen of\nhim in the white man\u2019s papers. He did not speak to my mother, because he did not\nknow the Indian language, but his glittering yellow eyes were fastened upon me. He\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 187 took long strides around the stove, passing behind the woman\u2019s chair. I threw down my\nspools, and ran to my mother. He did not fear her, but followed closely after me. Then I\nran round and round the stove, crying aloud for help. But my mother and the woman\nseemed not to know my danger. They sat still, looking quietly upon the devil\u2019s chase\nafter me. At last I grew dizzy. My head revolved as on a hidden pivot. My knees became\nnumb, and doubled under my weight like a pair of knife blades without a spring. Beside\nmy mother\u2019s chair I fell in a heap. Just as the devil stooped over me with outstretched\nclaws my mother awoke from her quiet indifference, and lifted me on her lap.\nWhereupon the devil vanished, and I was awake.\nOn the following morning I took my revenge upon the devil. Stealing into the room\nwhere a wall of shelves was filled with books, I drew forth The Stories of the Bible. With\na broken slate pencil I carried in my apron pocket, I began by scratching out his wicked\neyes. A few moments later, when I was ready to leave the room, there was a ragged\nhole in the page where the picture of the devil had once been.\nV. IRON ROUTINE\nA loud-clamoring bell awakened us at half-past six in the cold winter mornings. From\nhappy dreams of Western rolling lands and unlassoed freedom we tumbled out upon\nchilly bare floors back again into a paleface day. We had short time to jump into our\nshoes and clothes, and wet our eyes with icy water, before a small hand bell was\nvigorously rung for roll call.\nThere were too many drowsy children and too numerous orders for the day to waste a\nmoment in any apology to nature for giving her children such a shock in the early\nmorning. We rushed downstairs, bounding over two high steps at a time, to land in the\nassembly room.\nA paleface woman, with a yellow-covered roll book open on her arm and a gnawed\npencil in her hand, appeared at the door. Her small, tired face was coldly lighted with a\npair of large gray eyes.\nShe stood still in a halo of authority, while over the rim of her spectacles her eyes pried\nnervously about the room. Having glanced at her long list of names and called out the\nfirst one, she tossed up her chin and peered through the crystals of her spectacles to\nmake sure of the answer \u201cHere.\u201d\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 188 Relentlessly her pencil black-marked our daily records if we were not present to\nrespond to our names, and no chum of ours had done it successfully for us. No matter\nif a dull headache or the painful cough of slow consumption had delayed the absentee,\nthere was only time enough to mark the tardiness. It was next to impossible to leave\nthe iron routine after the civilizing machine had once begun its day\u2019s buzzing; and as it\nwas inbred in me to suffer in silence rather than to appeal to the ears of one whose\nopen eyes could not see my pain, I have many times trudged in the day\u2019s harness\nheavy-footed, like a dumb sick brute.\nOnce I lost a dear classmate. I remember well how she used to mope along at my side,\nuntil one morning she could not raise her head from her pillow. At her deathbed I stood\nweeping, as the paleface woman sat near her moistening the dry lips. Among the folds\nof the bedclothes I saw the open pages of the white man\u2019s Bible. The dying Indian girl\ntalked disconnectedly of Jesus the Christ and the paleface who was cooling her\nswollen hands and feet.\nI grew bitter, and censured the woman for cruel neglect of our physical ills. I despised\nthe pencils that moved automatically, and the one teaspoon which dealt out, from a\nlarge bottle, healing to a row of variously ailing Indian children. I blamed the hard-\nworking, well-meaning, ignorant woman who was inculcating in our hearts her\nsuperstitious ideas. Though I was sullen in all my little troubles, as soon as I felt better\nI was ready again to smile upon the cruel woman. Within a week I was again actively\ntesting the chains which tightly bound my individuality like a mummy for burial.\nThe melancholy of those black days has left so long a shadow that it darkens the path\nof years that have since gone by. These sad memories rise above those of smoothly\ngrinding school days. Perhaps my Indian nature is the moaning wind which stirs them\nnow for their present record. But, however tempestuous this is within me, it comes out\nas the low voice of a curiously colored seashell, which is only for those ears that are\nbent with compassion to hear it.\nVI. FOUR STRANGE SUMMERS.\nAfter my first three years of school, I roamed again in the Western country through four\nstrange summers.\nDuring this time I seemed to hang in the heart of chaos, beyond the touch or voice of\nhuman aid. My brother, being almost ten years my senior, did not quite understand my\nfeelings. My mother had never gone inside of a schoolhouse, and so she was not\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 189 capable of comforting her daughter who could read and write. Even nature seemed to\nhave no place for me. I was neither a wee girl nor a tall one; neither a wild Indian nor a\ntame one. This deplorable situation was the effect of my brief course in the East, and\nthe unsatisfactory \u201cteenth\u201d in a girl\u2019s years.\nIt was under these trying conditions that, one bright afternoon, as I sat restless and\nunhappy in my mother\u2019s cabin, I caught the sound of the spirited step of my brother\u2019s\npony on the road which passed by our dwelling. Soon I heard the wheels of a light\nbuckboard, and Daw\u00e9e\u2019s familiar \u201cHo!\u201d to his pony. He alighted upon the bare ground in\nfront of our house. Tying his pony to one of the projecting corner logs of the low-roofed\ncottage, he stepped upon the wooden doorstep.\nI met him there with a hurried greeting, and, as I passed by, he looked a quiet \u201cWhat?\u201d\ninto my eyes.\nWhen he began talking with my mother, I slipped the rope from the pony\u2019s bridle.\nSeizing the reins and bracing my feet against the dashboard, I wheeled around in an\ninstant. The pony was ever ready to try his speed. Looking backward, I saw Daw\u00e9e\nwaving his hand to me. I turned with the curve in the road and disappeared. I followed\nthe winding road which crawled upward between the bases of little hillocks. Deep\nwater-worn ditches ran parallel on either side. A strong wind blew against my cheeks\nand fluttered my sleeves. The pony reached the top of the highest hill, and began an\neven race on the level lands. There was nothing moving within that great circular\nhorizon of the Dakota prairies save the tall grasses, over which the wind blew and\nrolled off in long, shadowy waves.\nWithin this vast wigwam of blue and green I rode reckless and insignificant. It satisfied\nmy small consciousness to see the white foam fly from the pony\u2019s mouth.\nSuddenly, out of the earth a coyote came forth at a swinging trot that was taking the\ncunning thief toward the hills and the village beyond. Upon the moment\u2019s impulse, I\ngave him a long chase and a wholesome fright. As I turned away to go back to the\nvillage, the wolf sank down upon his haunches for rest, for it was a hot summer day;\nand as I drove slowly homeward, I saw his sharp nose still pointed at me, until I\nvanished below the margin of the hilltops.\nIn a little while I came in sight of my mother\u2019s house. Daw\u00e9e stood in the yard, laughing\nat an old warrior who was pointing his forefinger, and again waving his whole hand,\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 190 toward the hills. With his blanket drawn over one shoulder, he talked and motioned\nexcitedly. Daw\u00e9e turned the old man by the shoulder and pointed me out to him.\n\u201cOh, han!\u201d (Oh, yes) the warrior muttered, and went his way. He had climbed the top of\nhis favorite barren hill to survey the surrounding prairies, when he spied my chase after\nthe coyote. His keen eyes recognized the pony and driver. At once uneasy for my\nsafety, he had come running to my mother\u2019s cabin to give her warning. I did not\nappreciate his kindly interest, for there was an unrest gnawing at my heart.\nAs soon as he went away, I asked Daw\u00e9e about something else. \u201cNo, my baby sister, I\ncannot take you with me to the party tonight,\u201d he replied. Though I was not far from\nfifteen, and I felt that before long I should enjoy all the privileges of my tall cousin,\nDaw\u00e9e persisted in calling me his baby sister.\nThat moonlight night, I cried in my mother\u2019s presence when I heard the jolly young\npeople pass by our cottage. They were no more young braves in blankets and eagle\nplumes, nor Indian maids with prettily painted cheeks. They had gone three years to\nschool in the East, and had become civilized. The young men wore the white man\u2019s\ncoat and trousers, with bright neckties. The girls wore tight muslin dresses, with\nribbons at neck and waist. At these gatherings they talked English. I could speak\nEnglish almost as well as my brother, but I was not properly dressed to be taken along.\nI had no hat, no ribbons, and no close-fitting gown. Since my return from school I had\nthrown away my shoes, and wore again the soft moccasins.\nWhile Daw\u00e9e was busily preparing to go I controlled my tears. But when I heard him\nbounding away on his pony, I buried my face in my arms and cried hot tears.\nMy mother was troubled by my unhappiness. Coming to my side, she offered me the\nonly printed matter we had in our home. It was an Indian Bible, given her some years\nago by a missionary. She tried to console me. \u201cHere, my child, are the white man\u2019s\npapers. Read a little from them,\u201d she said most piously.\nI took it from her hand, for her sake; but my enraged spirit felt more like burning the\nbook, which afforded me no help, and was a perfect delusion to my mother. I did not\nread it, but laid it unopened on the floor, where I sat on my feet. The dim yellow light of\nthe braided muslin burning in a small vessel of oil flickered and sizzled in the awful\nsilent storm which followed my rejection of the Bible.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 191 Now my wrath against the fates consumed my tears before they reached my eyes. I sat\nstony, with a bowed head. My mother threw a shawl over her head and shoulders, and\nstepped out into the night.\nAfter an uncertain solitude, I was suddenly aroused by a loud cry piercing the night. It\nwas my mother\u2019s voice wailing among the barren hills which held the bones of buried\nwarriors. She called aloud for her brothers\u2019 spirits to support her in her helpless misery.\nMy fingers Grey icy cold, as I realized that my unrestrained tears had betrayed my\nsuffering to her, and she was grieving for me.\nBefore she returned, though I knew she was on her way, for she had ceased her\nweeping, I extinguished the light, and leaned my head on the window sill.\nMany schemes of running away from my surroundings hovered about in my mind. A\nfew more moons of such a turmoil drove me away to the eastern school. I rode on the\nwhite man\u2019s iron steed, thinking it would bring me back to my mother in a few winters,\nwhen I should be grown tall, and there would be congenial friends awaiting me.\nVII. INCURRING MY MOTHER\u2019S DISPLEASURE.\nIn the second journey to the East I had not come without some precautions. I had a\nsecret interview with one of our best medicine men, and when I left his wigwam I\ncarried securely in my sleeve a tiny bunch of magic roots. This possession assured me\nof friends wherever I should go. So absolutely did I believe in its charms that I wore it\nthrough all the school routine for more than a year. Then, before I lost my faith in the\ndead roots, I lost the little buckskin bag containing all my good luck.\nAt the close of this second term of three years I was the proud owner of my first\ndiploma. The following autumn I ventured upon a college career against my mother\u2019s\nwill.\nI had written for her approval, but in her reply I found no encouragement. She called my\nnotice to her neighbors\u2019 children, who had completed their education in three years.\nThey had returned to their homes, and were then talking English with the frontier\nsettlers. Her few words hinted that I had better give up my slow attempt to learn the\nwhite man\u2019s ways, and be content to roam over the prairies and find my living upon wild\nroots. I silenced her by deliberate disobedience.\nThus, homeless and heavy-hearted, I began anew my life among strangers.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 192 As I hid myself in my little room in the college dormitory, away from the scornful and\nyet curious eyes of the students, I pined for sympathy. Often I wept in secret, wishing I\nhad gone West, to be nourished by my mother\u2019s love, instead of remaining among a\ncold race whose hearts were frozen hard with prejudice.\nDuring the fall and winter seasons I scarcely had a real friend, though by that time\nseveral of my classmates were courteous to me at a safe distance.\nMy mother had not yet forgiven my rudeness to her, and I had no moment for letter-\nwriting. By daylight and lamplight, I spun with reeds and thistles, until my hands were\ntired from their weaving, the magic design which promised me the white man\u2019s respect.\nAt length, in the spring term, I entered an oratorical contest among the various classes.\nAs the day of competition approached, it did not seem possible that the event was so\nnear at hand, but it came. In the chapel the classes assembled together, with their\ninvited guests. The high platform was carpeted, and gaily festooned with college\ncolors. A bright white light illumined the room, and outlined clearly the great polished\nbeams that arched the domed ceiling. The assembled crowds filled the air with\npulsating murmurs. When the hour for speaking arrived all were hushed. But on the\nwall the old clock which pointed out the trying moment ticked calmly on.\nOne after another I saw and heard the orators. Still, I could not realize that they longed\nfor the favorable decision of the judges as much as I did. Each contestant received a\nloud burst of applause, and some were cheered heartily. Too soon my turn came, and I\npaused a moment behind the curtains for a deep breath. After my concluding words, I\nheard the same applause that the others had called out.\nUpon my retreating steps, I was astounded to receive from my fellow-students a large\nbouquet of roses tied with flowing ribbons. With the lovely flowers I fled from the\nstage. This friendly token was a rebuke to me for the hard feelings I had borne them.\nLater, the decision of the judges awarded me the first place. Then there was a mad\nuproar in the hall, where my classmates sang and shouted my name at the top of their\nlungs; and the disappointed students howled and brayed in fearfully dissonant tin\ntrumpets. In this excitement, happy students rushed forward to offer their\ncongratulations. And I could not conceal a smile when they wished to escort me in a\nprocession to the students\u2019 parlor, where all were going to calm themselves. Thanking\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 193 them for the kind spirit which prompted them to make such a proposition, I walked\nalone with the night to my own little room.\nA few weeks afterward, I appeared as the college representative in another contest.\nThis time the competition was among orators from different colleges in our State. It\nwas held at the State capital, in one of the largest opera houses.\nHere again was a strong prejudice against my people. In the evening, as the great\naudience filled the house, the student bodies began warring among themselves.\nFortunately, I was spared witnessing any of the noisy wrangling before the contest\nbegan. The slurs against the Indian that stained the lips of our opponents were already\nburning like a dry fever within my breast.\nBut after the orations were delivered a deeper burn awaited me. There, before that vast\nocean of eyes, some college rowdies threw out a large white flag, with a drawing of a\nmost forlorn Indian girl on it. Under this they had printed in bold black letters words\nthat ridiculed the college which was represented by a \u201csquaw.\u201d Such worse than\nbarbarian rudeness embittered me. While we waited for the verdict of the judges, I\ngleamed fiercely upon the throngs of palefaces. My teeth were hard set, as I saw the\nwhite flag still floating insolently in the air.\nThen anxiously we watched the man carry toward the stage the envelope containing\nthe final decision.\nThere were two prizes given, that night, and one of them was mine!\nThe evil spirit laughed within me when the white flag dropped out of sight, and the\nhands which hurled it hung limp in defeat.\nLeaving the crowd as quickly as possible, I was soon in my room. The rest of the night I\nsat in an armchair and gazed into the crackling fire. I laughed no more in triumph when\nthus alone. The little taste of victory did not satisfy a hunger in my heart. In my mind I\nsaw my mother far away on the Western plains, and she was holding a charge against\nme.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 194 The School Days of an Indian Girl by Zitkala-Sa is licensed under Public Domain: No\nKnown Copyright\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 195 The Dude Map is a visual and interactive text that challenges that idea that word usage\nor slang is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d Instead, the words we use are often bound in\n\u2022 time (Would you call a friend \u201cDaddy-O\u201d?),\n\u2022 space (Do you stand \u201cin line\u201d or \u201con line\u201d?), or\n\u2022 situation (What would your professor do if you stood up and yelled \u201cDefense!\u201d in\nthe middle of class?)\n#literacy #sociology #technology\nThe Dude Map\nNikhil Sonnad\nView The Dude Map and ask yourself how you could remake this map with different\nwords like Coke, soda, and pop.\nWhat times, spaces, or situations (i.e. contexts) affect the words you use?\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 196 In \u201cA Feminist\u2019s Guide to Rom-Coms,\u201d Aya Sutriasa addresses an important question to\neveryone who consumes popular culture: can we ethically enjoy movies, music, books,\nand shows that don\u2019t align with our individual values, and if so, how?

Some might celebrate\nGalentine\u2019s Day instead, some might skip on acknowledging the holiday at all, and\nsome, myself included, will be holed up watching romantic comedies.\nThe internet is filled with lists of which rom-coms will \u201cget you through\u201d Valentine\u2019s\nDay\u2014the assumption seems to be that, otherwise, we singles would be festering\nalone in our living rooms, drinking vodka and singing \u201cAll By Myself\u201d \u00e0 la Bridget\nJones. I enjoy the genre, but as a feminist I have some qualms.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 198 Romantic comedies, particularly \u201cthe classics\u201d of the genre, can be problematic by\ntoday\u2019s standards of feminism. Movies like Pretty Woman and Princess Bride tend to\nperpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and romanticize men\u2019s predatory behavior. Not\nto mention they are usually limited to depicting heterosexual relationships between an\nattractive cis man and an equally, perhaps even more, attractive cis woman. (LGBTQ\nfolks: Here\u2019s a list of rom-coms that drown out the heteronormative noise.) Lastly, if\nrom-coms are marketed to single women, then why are they mostly written and\ndirected by men? (That\u2019s a rhetorical question.)\nDespite all this, rom-coms are stunningly popular. How do you reconcile your love of\nrom-coms with your staunch feminism?\nMonique Jones, a pop culture critic and entertainment journalist, says that it\u2019s OK if you\nlike problematic rom-coms. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make us any less of an activist, it doesn\u2019t\nmake us any less down for the cause. It\u2019s just being a human\u2014and being part of a\nculture that has indoctrinated us to believe certain things, whether or not they\u2019re true,\u201d\nshe says.\nHowever, as feminists we do have to hold ourselves accountable, Jones says. Here are\nthree tips on how to be a responsible rom-com consumer.\n1.Be aware of how you\u2019re internalizing the underlying messages\nOne of the biggest problems with the genre is that it tends to reinforce problematic\nideas of romance. Contrary to rom-com plots, it\u2019s actually not an outrageous notion for\na man to love you \u201cjust as you are\u201d (Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, Trainwreck, Pretty Woman,\nGrease), but it actually is outrageous for a man to consistently ignore your rejections\nand relentlessly pursue you (The Notebook, 10 Things I Hate About You, 50 First Dates,\nBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s).\n\u201cThere are a lot of patriarchal things in society that we\u2019ve grown up with that we\u2019ve just\nassumed are normal. And those same ideals get stuck in these movies. That\u2019s why so\nmany of them don\u2019t get called out as being problematic, even though they are indicative\nof larger problems in society,\u201d Jones says.\nOnce you\u2019re aware of the patriarchal underpinnings of these movies, you can more\nobjectively decide what you believe is romantic. For example, maybe you don\u2019t think it\u2019s\nromantic to pretend to be someone\u2019s fianc\u00e9e while they are in a coma and have no idea\nwho you are. It\u2019s creepy, Sandra Bullock.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 199 2.Be conscious of what\/who you are supporting\nThis takes some research, but it\u2019s worth it (IMDB will be your new best friend). Jones\nsuggests learning what you can about the movie: Who\u2019s the director? Who wrote it?\nWho acts in it? What\u2019s the premise? \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel offended, then I think it\u2019s fine to\nwatch,\u201d Jones says.\nAnd for the movies we don\u2019t feel good about\u2014like anything involving Woody Allen\u2014\nconsider skipping it. \u201cI can\u2019t justify having my head in the sand just to support\nsomebody like Woody Allen,\u201d Jones says. She skips anything with his name attached to\nit.\n\u201cI never liked his movies anyway. They don\u2019t speak to me, first of all, as a woman, and\nsecond of all, as an African-American woman,\u201d she says. \u201cI know all the film critics and\nfilm students that I have been in contact with say that Woody Allen is a master at doing\nthis and that. But I don\u2019t align with anything that he does or is. And that\u2019s how I go\nabout it. If what the person does doesn\u2019t align with my core values, then I just can\u2019t do\nit.\u201d\nThere are funnier, more romantic movies than Annie Hall, anyway.\n3.Opt for rom-coms with fewer or zero problems\nI know the classics are, well, classics, but why not watch a movie that takes a healthier\napproach to romance? \u201cThere are always movies that are smaller productions, and they\nmight not have the big box-office dollars, but they\u2019re still well-crafted, well-made\nmovies,\u201d Jones says.\nHere\u2019s a list of five from Thought Catalog to get you started: Warm Bodies, She\u2019s Out of\nMy League, Celeste and Jesse Forever, My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding, and Kate and Leopold\n(sarcasm).\nSo, my fellow feminist rom-comphiles, don\u2019t be discouraged.\nThere are still a lot of things people can enjoy about romantic comedies, Jones says.\n\u201cWith as much choice as there is out there, a person doesn\u2019t have to give up their\nromantic comedy love altogether.\u201d\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 200 A Feminist\u2019s Guide to Rom-Coms and How to Watch Them by Ayu Sutriasa is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International\nLicense.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 201 Having first invaded Ireland in 1169, Great Britain occupied its island neighbor for\ncenturies, exploiting its resources and subjugating its inhabitants. To justify their\nmistreatment of a people who closely resembled themselves \u2013 that is, white, European,\nand Christian \u2013 the British insisted that the Irish were morally and intellectually inferior.\nDue to their distinctly Celtic culture, Gaelic tongue, and deep Catholic faith, the Irish\nwere regarded as a foreign threat by the Anglo-Saxon, English-speaking, mostly\nProtestant British. To the British, the Irish were poor, criminal, alcoholic, and lazy. Irish\nwriter Jonathan Swift\u2019s 1729 essay \u201cA Modest Proposal\u201d addresses the British\ngovernment\u2019s concern over Ireland\u2019s mounting poverty and high birth rate. Britain\u2019s\nleaders feared both the enormous economic burden of feeding Ireland\u2019s poor\npopulation and the growing number of Irish Catholics who posed a potential threat to\nthe British Protestant crown.\nSwift sets up \u201cA Modest Proposal\u201d as a classically designed logical argument. He\npresents a problem, demonstrates its magnitude and consequences, and asserts that a\nsolution must be found that is simple, practical, and inexpensive. The \u201cmodest\u201d\nsolution that Swift proposes will likely shock first-time readers. However, Swift is\nemploying satire, a form of comedy in which shortcomings, vices, and abuses are\nridiculed to shame an individual, group, or society with the intent of inspiring change or\nreform. Today, social and political satire can be seen regularly on popular television\nshows like The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and\nperhaps most famously on Saturday Night Live. By proposing his alarmingly\nunconventional solution to the problem of Irish poverty, Swift isn\u2019t merely trolling \u2013 that\nis, posting provocative messages online for the purpose of causing confusion or harm.\nRather, by exaggerating Britain\u2019s dehumanizing mistreatment of the Irish to its logical\nextreme, Swift employs satire to invite his readers to question their own attitude and\nbehavior toward those whom they regard as inferior.\nIntroduction by Brent Shannon\n#politics #sociology #history #classics\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 202 A Modest Proposal\nJonathan Swift\nIt is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel in the\ncountry, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabbin-doors crowded with beggars\nof the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning\nevery passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their\nhonest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for\ntheir helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or\nleave their dear native country, to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to\nthe Barbadoes.\nI think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in the arms, or\non the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the\npresent deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and\ntherefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these\nchildren sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so well of\nthe publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.\nBut my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of\nprofessed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the whole number of\ninfants at a certain age, who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them,\nas those who demand our charity in the streets.\nAs to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important\nsubject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors, I have always\nfound them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its\ndam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment: at\nmost not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may certainly get, or the\nvalue in scraps, by her lawful occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old\nthat I propose to provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon\ntheir parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, they\nshall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the clothing of many\nthousands.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 203 There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent those\nvoluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard\nchildren, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt,\nmore to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the\nmost savage and inhuman breast.\nThe number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half, of\nthese I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple, whose wives are\nbreeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple, who are able to\nmaintain their own children, (although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the\npresent distresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain a hundred\nand seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those women who\nmiscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within the year. There only\nremain a hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born. The\nquestion therefore is, How this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I\nhave already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the\nmethods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or\nagriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they\ncan very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except\nwhere they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much\nearlier; during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as\nprobationers; as I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of Cavan,\nwho protested to me, that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of\nsix, even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.\nI am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve years old, is no\nsaleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not yield above\nthree pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the exchange; which\ncannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and\nrags having been at least four times that value.\nI shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable\nto the least objection.\nI have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a\nyoung healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and\nwholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it\nwill equally serve in a fricasee, or a ragoust.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 204 I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred and twenty\nthousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed,\nwhereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black\ncattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage,\na circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be\nsufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year\nold, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom,\nalways advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to\nrender them plump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an\nentertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will\nmake a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good\nboiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.\nI have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds, and in a\nsolar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 pounds.\nI grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords, who, as\nthey have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title to the\nchildren.\nInfant\u2019s flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful in March, and a\nlittle before and after; for we are told by a grave author, an eminent French physician,\nthat fish being a prolifick dyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick\ncountries about nine months after Lent, than at any other season; therefore, reckoning\na year after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because the number of\nPopish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom, and therefore it will have one\nother collateral advantage, by lessening the number of Papists among us.\nI have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar\u2019s child (in which list I reckon\nall cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers) to be about two shillings per\nannum, rags included; and I believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for\nthe carcass of a good fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent\nnutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his own family to dine with\nhim. Thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord, and grow popular among his\ntenants, the mother will have eight shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she\nproduces another child.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 205 Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may flay the carcass;\nthe skin of which, artificially dressed, will make admirable gloves for ladies, and\nsummer boots for fine gentlemen.\nAs to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in the most\nconvenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting; although I\nrather recommend buying the children alive, and dressing them hot from the knife, as\nwe do roasting pigs.\nA very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I highly esteem,\nwas lately pleased in discoursing on this matter, to offer a refinement upon my\nscheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this kingdom, having of late destroyed their\ndeer, he conceived that the want of venison might be well supplied by the bodies of\nyoung lads and maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so\ngreat a number of both sexes in every county being now ready to starve for want of\nwork and service: and these to be disposed of by their parents if alive, or otherwise by\ntheir nearest relations. But with due deference to so excellent a friend, and so\ndeserving a patriot, I cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my\nAmerican acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was\ngenerally tough and lean, like that of our schoolboys, by continual exercise, and their\ntaste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not answer the charge. Then as to the\nfemales, it would, I think, with humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because\nthey soon would become breeders themselves: and besides, it is not improbable that\nsome scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although indeed\nvery unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I confess, hath always been with\nme the strongest objection against any project, how well soever intended.\nBut in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient was put into his head\nby the famous Psalmanaazor, a native of the island Formosa, who came from thence to\nLondon, above twenty years ago, and in conversation told my friend, that in his country,\nwhen any young person happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass\nto persons of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a plump girl of\nfifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the Emperor, was sold to his\nimperial majesty\u2019s prime minister of state, and other great mandarins of the court in\njoints from the gibbet, at four hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the\nsame use were made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single\ngroat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear at a playhouse\nand assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for, the kingdom would not\nbe the worse.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 206 Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of\npoor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have been desired to employ my\nthoughts what course may be taken, to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance.\nBut I am not in the least pain upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they\nare every day dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast as\ncan be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they are now in almost as\nhopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and consequently pine away from want of\nnourishment, to a degree, that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common\nlabour, they have not strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are\nhappily delivered from the evils to come.\nI have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I think the\nadvantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of the\nhighest importance.\nFor first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the number of Papists, with\nwhom we are yearly overrun, being the principal breeders of the nation, as well as our\nmost dangerous enemies, and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver\nthe kingdom to the Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so\nmany good Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at\nhome and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate.\nSecondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, which by law\nmay be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their landlord\u2019s rent, their corn and\ncattle being already seized, and money a thing unknown.\nThirdly, Whereas the maintainance of a hundred thousand children, from two years old,\nand upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum, the\nnation\u2019s stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the\nprofit of a new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom,\nwho have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate among our selves, the\ngoods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture.\nFourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum\nby the sale of their children, will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first\nyear.\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 207 Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where the vintners will\ncertainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection; and\nconsequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value\nthemselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands\nhow to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they please.\nSixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise nations have\neither encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and penalties. It would encrease the\ncare and tenderness of mothers towards their children, when they were sure of a\nsettlement for life to the poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their\nannual profit instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the\nmarried women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the market. Men would\nbecome as fond of their wives, during the time of their pregnancy, as they are now of\ntheir mares in foal, their cows in calf, or sows when they are ready to farrow; nor offer\nto beat or kick them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.\nMany other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition of some\nthousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel\u2019d beef: the propagation of swine\u2019s\nflesh, and improvement in the art of making good bacon, so much wanted among us by\nthe great destruction of pigs, too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable\nin taste or magnificence to a well grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole will\nmake a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor\u2019s feast, or any other publick entertainment.\nBut this, and many others, I omit, being studious of brevity.\nSupposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant customers for\ninfants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry meetings, particularly at\nweddings and christenings, I compute that Dublin would take off annually about twenty\nthousand carcasses; and the rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold\nsomewhat cheaper) the remaining eighty thousand.\nI can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against this proposal, unless\nit should be urged, that the number of people will be thereby much lessened in the\nkingdom. This I freely own, and was indeed one principal design in offering it to the\nworld. I desire the reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one individual\nKingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or, I think, ever can be upon\nEarth. Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at\nfive shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor houshold furniture, except what is\nof our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments\nthat promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and\ngaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance:\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 208 Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the\ninhabitants of Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any\nlonger like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment their city\nwas taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for\nnothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their\ntenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shopkeepers,\nwho, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would\nimmediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the\ngoodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing,\nthough often and earnestly invited to it.\nTherefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, till he hath at\nleast some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to\nput them into practice.\nBut, as to myself, having been wearied out for many years with offering vain, idle,\nvisionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of success, I fortunately fell upon\nthis proposal, which, as it is wholly new, so it hath something solid and real, of no\nexpence and little trouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger in\ndisobliging England. For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation, and flesh\nbeing of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, although\nperhaps I could name a country, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation\nwithout it.\nAfter all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject any offer,\nproposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent, cheap, easy, and\neffectual. But before something of that kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my\nscheme, and offering a better, I desire the author or authors will be pleased maturely to\nconsider two points. First, As things now stand, how they will be able to find food and\nraiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly, There being\na round million of creatures in humane figure throughout this kingdom, whose whole\nsubsistence put into a common stock, would leave them in debt two million of pounds\nsterling, adding those who are beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers\nand labourers, with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire those\npoliticians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an answer,\nthat they will first ask the parents of these mortals, whether they would not at this day\nthink it a great happiness to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I\nprescribe, and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they\nhave since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the impossibility of paying\nrent without money or trade, the want of common sustenance, with neither house nor\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 209 clothes to cover them from the inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable\nprospect of intailing the like, or greater miseries, upon their breed forever.\nI profess in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least personal interest in\nendeavouring to promote this necessary work, having no other motive than the publick\ngood of my country, by advancing our trade, providing for infants, relieving the poor,\nand giving some pleasure to the rich. I have no children, by which I can propose to get a\nsingle penny; the youngest being nine years old, and my wife past child-bearing.\nA Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift is licensed under Public Domain: No Known\nCopyright\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 210 Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 \u2013 April 21, 1910), better known by his\npen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, entrepreneur, publisher and lecturer.\nAmong his novels are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures\nof Huckleberry Finn (1885), the latter often called \u201cThe Great American Novel.\u201d\nTwain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom\nSawyer and Huckleberry Finn. After an apprenticeship with a printer, Twain worked as a\ntypesetter and contributed articles to the newspaper of his older brother, Orion\nClemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading\nwest to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining,\nturning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. In 1865, his humorous\nstory \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\u201d was published, based on a\nstory he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some\ntime as a miner. The short story brought international attention, and was even\ntranslated into classic Greek. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise\nfrom critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and\nEuropean royalty.\nTwain describes his boyhood in Life on the Mississippi, stating that \"there was but one\npermanent ambition\" among his comrades: to be a steamboatman. \"Pilot was the\ngrandest position of all. The pilot, even in those days of trivial wages, had a princely\nsalary \u2013 from a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no\nboard to pay.\" As Twain described it, the pilot's prestige exceeded that of the captain.\nThe pilot had to \"get up a warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and\none-limbed cottonwood and every obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this\nriver for twelve hundred miles; and more than that, must... actually know where these\nthings are in the dark\". Steamboat pilot Horace E. Bixby took Twain on as a cub pilot to\nteach him the river between New Orleans and St. Louis for $500 (equivalent to $16,000\nin 2021), payable out of Twain's first wages after graduating. It was more than two\nyears before he received his pilot's license. Piloting also gave him his pen name from\n\"mark twain\", the leadsman's cry for a measured river depth of two fathoms (12 feet),\nwhich was safe water for a steamboat.\nBiography of Mark Twain.

And it\nwas not a book to be read once and thrown aside, for it had a new story to tell every\nday. Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there was never a page that was void of\ninterest, never one that you could leave unread without loss, never one that you would\nwant to skip, thinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other thing. There never\nwas so wonderful a book written by man; never one whose interest was so absorbing,\nso unflagging, so sparkingly renewed with every reperusal. The passenger who could\nnot read it was charmed with a peculiar sort of faint dimple on its surface (on the rare\noccasions when he did not overlook it altogether); but to the pilot that was an italicized\npassage; indeed, it was more than that, it was a legend of the largest capitals, with a\nstring of shouting exclamation points at the end of it; for it meant that a wreck or a rock\nwas buried there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated. It\nis the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes, and the most hideous to\na pilot\u2019s eye. In truth, the passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all\nmanner of pretty pictures in it painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas to\nthe trained eye these were not pictures at all, but the grimmest and most dead-earnest\nof reading-matter.\nNow when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to know every\ntrifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters of the\nalphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost something, too. I had lost\nsomething which could never be restored to me while I lived. All the grace, the beauty,\nthe poetry had gone out of the majestic river! I still keep in mind a certain wonderful\nsunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me. A broad expanse of the\nriver was turned to blood; in the middle distance the red hue brightened into gold,\nthrough which a solitary log came floating, black and conspicuous; in one place a long,\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 212 slanting mark lay sparkling upon the water; in another the surface was broken by\nboiling, tumbling rings, that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the ruddy flush was\nfaintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines,\never so delicately traced; the shore on our left was densely wooded, and the somber\nshadow that fell from this forest was broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that\nshone like silver; and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a\nsingle leafy bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was\nflowing from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images, woody heights,\nsoft distances; and over the whole scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted\nsteadily, enriching it, every passing moment, with new marvels of coloring.\nI stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless rapture. The world was new to\nme, and I had never seen anything like this at home. But as I have said, a day came\nwhen I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which the moon and the\nsun and the twilight wrought upon the river\u2019s face; another day came when I ceased\naltogether to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should have\nlooked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it, inwardly, after this\nfashion: This sun means that we are going to have wind to-morrow; that floating log\nmeans that the river is rising, small thanks to it; that slanting mark on the water refers\nto a bluff reef which is going to kill somebody\u2019s steamboat one of these nights, if it\nkeeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling \u2018boils\u2019 show a dissolving bar and a\nchanging channel there; the lines and circles in the slick water over yonder are a\nwarning that that troublesome place is shoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in\nthe shadow of the forest is the \u2018break\u2019 from a new snag, and he has located himself in\nthe very best place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead tree, with\na single living branch, is not going to last long, and then how is a body ever going to get\nthrough this blind place at night without the friendly old landmark.\nNo, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river. All the value any feature\nof it had for me now was the amount of usefulness it could furnish toward compassing\nthe safe piloting of a steamboat. Since those days, I have pitied doctors from my heart.\nWhat does the lovely flush in a beauty\u2019s cheek mean to a doctor but a \u2018break\u2019 that\nripples above some deadly disease. Are not all her visible charms sown thick with what\nare to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay? Does he ever see her beauty at all,\nor doesn\u2019t he simply view her professionally, and comment upon her unwholesome\ncondition all to himself? And doesn\u2019t he sometimes wonder whether he has gained\nmost or lost most by learning his trade?\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 213 Two Ways of Seeing a River by Mark Twain is licensed under Public Domain: No Known\nCopyright\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 214 Born in Africa (probably in Senegal or Gambia), Phillis Wheatley was enslaved at the\nage of seven or eight, when she was bought by John Wheatley (1703\u20131778) of Boston\nto serve as his wife Susannah\u2019s companion. Susannah fostered Wheatley\u2019s intellectual\navidity by having her daughter Mary oversee Wheatley\u2019s education. Wheatley became\nwell-read in the Bible; classical literature, including some of the classics in their\noriginal Latin; and English literature, responding especially to the works of Alexander\nPope (1688\u20131744), master of the heroic couplet, and John Milton. She also converted\nto Christianity, becoming a member of the Old South Congregational Church.\nTouted as a prodigy, Wheatley traveled to London for the publication of her Poems on\nVarious Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773). There she became a minor celebrity,\nmeeting the lord mayor of London, Benjamin Franklin, and William Legge, the 2nd Earl\nof Dartmouth (1731\u20131801). The same year that her Poems were published, Wheatley\nwas freed from slavery.\nIn the past, her poetry was deemed unoriginal, as giving little sense of Africa, her race,\nor her life as a slave. This reading attests to Wheatley\u2019s strategic success in opposing\nprevalent views of women, blacks, and slaves during her era. Her poems are now\nrecognized for their strong assertion of equality among all humankind and their strong-\nminded expression of self to contemporary readers who denied that selfhood.\nSource: Becoming America, Wendy Kurant, ed., CC-BY-SA\n#gender #diversity #history #classics\nPhyllis Wheatley\n\u201cOn Being Brought from Africa to America\u201d\n(1773)\n'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,\nTaught my benighted soul to understand\nThat there's a God, that there's a Saviour too:\nOnce I redemption neither sought nor knew.\nSome view our sable race with scornful eye,\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 215 \"Their colour is a diabolic die.\"\nRemember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain,\nMay be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.\n\u201cTo the Right Honorable William, Earl of Dartmouth\u201d\n(1773)\nHAIL, happy day, when, smiling like the morn,\nFair Freedom rose New-England to adorn:\nThe northern clime beneath her genial ray,\nDartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway:\nElate with hope her race no longer mourns,\nEach soul expands, each grateful bosom burns,\nWhile in thine hand with pleasure we behold\nThe silken reins, and Freedom's charms unfold.\nLong lost to realms beneath the northern skies\nShe shines supreme, while hated faction dies:\nSoon as appear'd the Goddess long desir'd,\nSick at the view, she languish'd and expir'd;\nThus from the splendors of the morning light\nThe owl in sadness seeks the caves of night.\nNo more, America, in mournful strain\nOf wrongs, and grievance unredress'd complain,\nNo longer shalt thou dread the iron chain,\nWhich wanton Tyranny with lawless hand\nHad made, and with it meant t' enslave the land.\nShould you, my lord, while you peruse my song,\nWonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,\nWhence flow these wishes for the common good,\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 216 By feeling hearts alone best understood,\nI, young in life, by seeming cruel fate\nWas snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat:\nWhat pangs excruciating must molest,\nWhat sorrows labour in my parent's breast?\nSteel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd\nThat from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd:\nSuch, such my case.

Samson Occom\u201d\n(1773)\nThe Connecticut Gazette, March 11, 1774\nRev\u2019d and honor\u2019d Sir,\nI have this Day received your obliging kind Epistle, and am greatly satisfied with your\nReasons respecting the Negroes, and think highly reasonable what you offer in\nVindication of their natural Rights: Those that invade them cannot be insensible that\nthe divine Light is chasing away the thick Darkness which broods over the Land of\nAfrica; and the Chaos which has reign\u2019d so long, is converting into beautiful Order, and\n[r]eveals more and more clearly, the glorious Dispensation of civil and religious Liberty,\nwhich are so inseparably Limited, that there is little or no Enjoyment of one Without the\nother: Otherwise, perhaps, the Israelites had been less solicitous for their Freedom\nfrom Egyptian slavery; I do not say they would have been contented without it, by no\nmeans, for in every human Breast, God has implanted a Principle, which we call Love of\nFreedom; it is impatient of Oppression, and pants for Deliverance; and by the Leave of\nour modern Egyptians I will assert, that the same Principle lives in us. God grant\nDeliverance in his own Way and Time, and get him honour upon all those whose\nAvarice impels them to countenance and help forward tile Calamities of their fellow\nCreatures. This I desire not for their Hurt, but to convince them of the strange\nAbsurdity of their Conduct whose Words and Actions are so diametrically, opposite.\nHow well the Cry for Liberty, and the reverse Disposition for the exercise of oppressive\nPower over others agree,\u2014I humbly think it does not require the Penetration of a\nPhilosopher to determine.\u2014\nSelections found in Becoming America by Wendy Kurant licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.\nReturn to Table of Contents\nThe Commons: Tools for Reading, Writing, and Rhetoric 221 "}
