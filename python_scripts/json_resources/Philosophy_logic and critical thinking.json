Just as the eye perceives\ncolours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas.\u201d \u2013 Rudolph Steiner.\nWhat is thinking? It may seem strange to begin a logic textbook with this question. \u2018Thinking\u2019 is\nperhaps the most intimate and personal thing that people do. Yet the more you \u2018think\u2019 about thinking,\nthe more mysterious it can appear. It is the sort of thing that one intuitively or naturally understands, and\nyet cannot describe to others without great difficulty. Many people believe that logic is very abstract,\ndispassionate, complicated, and even cold. But in fact the study of logic is nothing more intimidating or\nobscure than this: the study of good thinking.\nBefore asking what good thinking is, we might want to ask a few questions about thinking as\nsuch. Let\u2019s say that thinking is the activity of the mind. It includes activities like reasoning, perceiving,\nexplaining, inventing, problem solving, learning, teaching, contemplating, knowing, and even dreaming.\nWe think about everything, all the time. We think about ordinary practical matters like what to have for\ndinner tonight, all the way to the most abstract and serious matters, like the meaning of life. You are\nthinking, right now, as you read this sentence.\nSome may wish to draw a distinction between thinking and feeling, including sense perception,\nemotional experience, or even religious faith. Some might want to argue that computers or animals are\ncapable of thinking, even if their way of thinking is somehow different from that of humans. And some\nmight say that the question is an absurd one: everyone knows what thinking is, because everyone\n\u2018thinks\u2019 all the time, and everyone can \u2018feel\u2019 themselves thinking. We are somehow \u2018aware\u2019 of thoughts\nin our minds, aware of information and knowledge, aware of memories, and aware of likely future\nprobabilities and so on. Thinking is a first-order phenomenological insight: it\u2019s a bit like knowing what\nthe colour \u2018red\u2019 looks like, or knowing the taste of an orange. You know what it is, but you probably\nhave an awfully hard time describing or defining it.\nThinking, in this way of \u2018thinking\u2019 about thinking, is an event. It is something done, something\nthat takes place, and something that happens.\nThere are a lot of serious philosophical (as well as scientific) questions about the nature of\nthinking. For instance, we might ask: \u2018who is it that knows that he or she knows?\u2019 Who is it that is aware\nof thinking? And is not that awareness of thinking itself a kind of thinking? This is a line of questioning\nthat may seem as if it can go on forever. It\u2019s a little bit beyond the purpose of this book to investigate all\nof them. But if you happen to find yourself asking how do you know that you know something, or if you\nfind yourself thinking about the nature of thinking itself, you may be well on your way toward becoming\nan excellent philosopher!\nWhy is good thinking important?\n1 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

You\u2019ll hear\npeople quote a line from a popular song or movie, and then they\u2019ll say, \u201cThat\u2019s my philosophy.\u201d But\nthere\u2019s a lot more to it than that; and a person who merely repeats a popular saying and calls it\nphilosophy has not been doing enough work. Philosophical questions are often very difficult questions,\nand they demand a lot of effort and consideration and time.\nGood and bad thinking are very different from each other. Yet some people might feel personally\nthreatened by this distinction. Your thoughts are probably the most intimate and the most precious of all\nyour possessions. Your mind, indeed, is the only part of you that is truly \u2018yours\u2019, and cannot be taken\naway from you. Thus if someone tells you that your thinking is muddled, confused, unclear, or just plain\nmistaken, then you might feel very hurt or very offended.\nBut your thinking certainly can be muddled or confused. Normally, bad quality thinking happens\nwhen your mind has been \u2018possessed\u2019, so to speak, by other people and made to serve their purposes\ninstead of your own. This can happen in various ways.\nIn your life so far, you have gathered a lot of beliefs about a lot of different topics. You believe\nthings about who you are, what the world is like, where you belong in the world, and what to do with\nyour life. You have beliefs about what is good music and bad music, what kind of movies are funny and\nwhat kind are boring, whether it\u2019s right or wrong to get a tattoo, whether the police can be trusted,\nwhether or not there is a god, and so on. These beliefs came from somewhere. Most of you probably\ngathered your most important beliefs during your childhood. You learned them from your family,\nespecially your parents, your teachers at school, your piano instructor or your karate instructor, your\nscout group or guide group leader, your priest, your medical doctor, your friends, and just about\nanybody who had any kind of influence on your life. There is nothing wrong with learning things from\nother people this way; indeed, we probably couldn\u2019t get much of a start in life without this kind of\ninfluence. But if you have accepted your beliefs from these sources, and not done your own\nthinking about them, then they are not your beliefs, and you are not truly thinking your own\nthoughts. They are, instead, someone else\u2019s thoughts and beliefs, occupying your mind. If you believe\nsomething only because someone else taught it to you, and not because you examined those beliefs on\nyour own, then in an important sense, you are not having your own thoughts. And if you are not having\nyour own thoughts, then you are not living your own life, and you are not truly free.\nSome people might resist studying logic for other reasons. They may prefer to trust their intuition\nor their \u201cgut feelings\u201d as a source of knowledge. I\u2019m always very curious about such people. Perhaps\nthey think that logic is dispassionate and unemotional, and that logical people end up cold-hearted and\nemotionless, like robots. Perhaps they find their intuitive beliefs so gratifying that they cannot allow\nanything to interfere with them. Perhaps they worry that they may have to re-evaluate their beliefs and\ntheir lives, and perhaps change their lives as a result of that re-evaluation. Those things may be true for\nsome people, if not for all of them. But when your beliefs are grounded in reason, the quality of your\ninner life will be far, far better, in ways like these:\n\u2022 You will be in greater conscious control of your own mind and thoughts.\n\u2022 It will be harder for advertising, political propaganda, peer pressure, scams and\nconfidence tricks, or other forms of psychological manipulation to affect you.\n\u2022 When your actions or motives are questioned, you will be much better able to explain\nyourself effectively and persuasively.\n\u2022 You will be able to understand difficult, complex, and challenging ideas a lot easier, and\nwith a lot less anxiety.\n\u2022 You will be able to understand things in a more comprehensive and complete way.\n\u2022 You will be better able to identify the source of your problems, whether practical or\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 2 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\npersonal, and better able to handle or solve those problems.\n\u2022 You will feel much less frustrated or upset when you come across something that you do\nnot understand.\n\u2022 You will be better able to plan for the future, compete for better paying or more\nprestigious jobs, and to gather political power.\n\u2022 You will find it easier to stand up to governments, employers, and other authorities when\nthey act unjustly.\n\u2022 Tragedies, bad fortune, stress, and other problems in life will be easier to deal with.\n\u2022 You will find it easier to understand other people\u2019s feelings and other people\u2019s points of\nview, and you will be better able to help prevent those differences from becoming\nconflicts.\n\u2022 You will get much more pleasure and enjoyment from the arts, music, poetry, science,\nand culture.\n\u2022 You may even enjoy life more than you otherwise would.\nArgument2\nIn philosophy and logic, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of\nsomething or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion. The general form of an argument in a natural\nlanguage is that of premises (typically in the form of propositions, statements or sentences) in support of\na claim: the conclusion. The structure of some arguments can also be set out in a formal language, and\nformally defined \"arguments\" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math,\nlogic, and computer science.\nIn a typical deductive argument, the premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion, while in an\ninductive argument, they are thought to provide reasons supporting the conclusion's probable truth. The\nstandards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth,\nfor example, the persuasiveness of so-called \"indispensability claims\" in transcendental arguments, the\nquality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.\nThe standards and criteria used in evaluating arguments and their forms of reasoning are studied in\nlogic. Ways of formulating arguments effectively are studied in rhetoric (see also: argumentation\ntheory). An argument in a formal language shows the logical form of the symbolically represented or\nnatural language arguments obtained by its interpretations.\nFormal and informal\nInformal arguments as studied in informal logic, are presented in ordinary language and are intended for\neveryday discourse. Conversely, formal arguments are studied in formal logic (historically called\nsymbolic logic, more commonly referred to as mathematical logic today) and are expressed in a formal\nlanguage. Informal logic may be said to emphasize the study of argumentation, whereas formal logic\nemphasizes implication and inference. Informal arguments are sometimes implicit. That is, the rational\n2 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. Citation: Argument. (2016, December 14). In\nWikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

Each premise and the conclusion are\ntruth bearers or \"truth-candidates\", each capable of being either true or false (but not both). These truth\nvalues bear on the terminology used with arguments.\nDeductive arguments\n\u2022 A deductive argument asserts that the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the\npremises. Based on the premises, the conclusion follows necessarily (with certainty). For\nexample, given premises that A=B and B=C, then the conclusion follows necessarily that A=C.\nDeductive arguments are sometimes referred to as \"truth-preserving\" arguments.\n\u2022 A deductive argument is said to be valid or invalid. If one assumes the premises to be true\n(ignoring their actual truth values), would the conclusion follow with certainty? If yes, the\nargument is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid. In determining validity, the structure of the argument\nis essential to the determination, not the actual truth values. For example, consider the argument\nthat because bats can fly (premise=true), and all flying creatures are birds (premise=false),\ntherefore bats are birds (conclusion=false). If we assume the premises are true, the conclusion\nfollows necessarily, and thus it is a valid argument.\n\u2022 If a deductive argument is valid and its premises are all true, then it is also referred to as sound.\nOtherwise, it is unsound, as in the \"bats are birds\" example.\nInductive arguments\n\u2022 An inductive argument, on the other hand, asserts that the truth of the conclusion is supported to\nsome degree of probability by the premises. For example, given that the U.S. military budget is\nthe largest in the world (premise=true), then it is probable that it will remain so for the next 10\nyears (conclusion=true). Arguments that involve predictions are inductive, as the future is\nuncertain.\n\u2022 An inductive argument is said to be strong or weak. If the premises of an inductive argument are\nassumed true, is it probable the conclusion is also true? If so, the argument is strong. Otherwise,\nit is weak.\n\u2022 A strong argument is said to be cogent if it has all true premises. Otherwise, the argument is\nuncogent. The military budget argument example above is a strong, cogent argument.\nDeductive\nA deductive argument is one that, if valid, has a conclusion that is entailed by its premises. In other\nwords, the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises\u2014if the premises are true,\nthen the conclusion must be true. It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny the\nconclusion, because the negation of the conclusion is contradictory to the truth of the premises.\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 4 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nValidity\nDeductive arguments may be either valid or invalid. If an argument is valid, it is a valid deduction, and\nif its premises are true, the conclusion must be true: a valid argument cannot have true premises and a\nfalse conclusion.\nAn argument is formally valid if and only if the denial of the conclusion is incompatible with accepting\nall the premises.\nThe validity of an argument depends, however, not on the actual truth or falsity of its premises and\nconclusion, but solely on whether or not the argument has a valid logical form. The validity of an\nargument is not a guarantee of the truth of its conclusion. Under a given interpretation, a valid argument\nmay have false premises that render it inconclusive: the conclusion of a valid argument with one or more\nfalse premises may be either true or false.\nLogic seeks to discover the valid forms, the forms that make arguments valid. A form of argument is\nvalid if and only if the conclusion is true under all interpretations of that argument in which the premises\nare true. Since the validity of an argument depends solely on its form, an argument can be shown to be\ninvalid by showing that its form is invalid. This can be done by giving a counter example of the same\nform of argument with premises that are true under a given interpretation, but a conclusion that is false\nunder that interpretation. In informal logic this is called a counter argument.\nThe form of argument can be shown by the use of symbols. For each argument form, there is a\ncorresponding statement form, called a corresponding conditional, and an argument form is valid if and\nonly if its corresponding conditional is a logical truth. A statement form which is logically true is also\nsaid to be a valid statement form. A statement form is a logical truth if it is true under all interpretations.\nA statement form can be shown to be a logical truth by either (a) showing that it is a tautology or (b) by\nmeans of a proof procedure.\nThe corresponding conditional of a valid argument is a necessary truth (true in all possible worlds) and\nso the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, or follows of logical necessity. The conclusion\nof a valid argument is not necessarily true, it depends on whether the premises are true. If the\nconclusion, itself, just so happens to be a necessary truth, it is so without regard to the premises.\nSome examples:\n\u2022 All Greeks are human and all humans are mortal; therefore, all Greeks are mortal. : Valid\nargument; if the premises are true the conclusion must be true.\n\u2022 Some Greeks are logicians and some logicians are tiresome; therefore, some Greeks are\ntiresome. Invalid argument: the tiresome logicians might all be Romans (for example).\n\u2022 Either we are all doomed or we are all saved; we are not all saved; therefore, we are all\ndoomed. Valid argument; the premises entail the conclusion. (Remember that this does not mean\nthe conclusion has to be true; it is only true if the premises are true, which they may not be!)\n\u2022 Some men are hawkers. Some hawkers are rich. Therefore, some men are rich. Invalid argument.\nThis can be easier seen by giving a counter-example with the same argument form:\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 5 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\no Some people are herbivores. Some herbivores are zebras. Therefore, some people are\nzebras. Invalid argument, as it is possible that the premises be true and the conclusion\nfalse.\nIn the above second to last case (Some men are hawkers...), the counter-example follows the same\nlogical form as the previous argument, (Premise 1: \"Some X are Y.\" Premise 2: \"Some Y are Z.\"\nConclusion: \"Some X are Z.\") in order to demonstrate that whatever hawkers may be, they may or may\nnot be rich, in consideration of the premises as such. (See also, existential import).\nThe forms of argument that render deductions valid are well-established, however some invalid\narguments can also be persuasive depending on their construction (inductive arguments, for example).\n(See also, formal fallacy and informal fallacy).\nSoundness\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose conclusion follows from its premise(s), and the premise(s)\nof which is/are true.\nInductive\nNon-deductive logic is reasoning using arguments in which the premises support the conclusion but do\nnot entail it. Forms of non-deductive logic include the statistical syllogism, which argues from\ngeneralizations true for the most part, and induction, a form of reasoning that makes generalizations\nbased on individual instances. An inductive argument is said to be cogent if and only if the truth of the\nargument's premises would render the truth of the conclusion probable (i.e., the argument is strong), and\nthe argument's premises are, in fact, true. Cogency can be considered inductive logic's analogue to\ndeductive logic's \"soundness.\" Despite its name, mathematical induction is not a form of inductive\nreasoning. The lack of deductive validity is known as the problem of induction.\nDefeasible arguments and argumentation schemes\nIn modern argumentation theories, arguments are regarded as defeasible passages from premises to a\nconclusion. Defeasibility means that when additional information (new evidence or contrary arguments)\nis provided, the premises may be no longer lead to the conclusion (non-monotonic reasoning). This type\nof reasoning is referred to as defeasible reasoning. For instance we consider the famous Tweedy\nexample:\nTweedy is a bird.\nBirds generally fly.\nTherefore, Tweedy (probably) flies.\nThis argument is reasonable and the premises support the conclusion unless additional information\nindicating that the case is an exception comes in. If Tweedy is a penguin, the inference is no longer\njustified by the premise. Defeasible arguments are based on generalizations that hold only in the\nmajority of cases, but are subject to exceptions and defaults. In order to represent and assess defeasible\nreasoning, it is necessary to combine the logical rules (governing the acceptance of a conclusion based\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 6 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\non the acceptance of its premises) with rules of material inference, governing how a premise can support\na given conclusion (whether it is reasonable or not to draw a specific conclusion from a specific\ndescription of a state of affairs). Argumentation schemes have been developed to describe and assess the\nacceptability or the fallaciousness of defeasible arguments. Argumentation schemes are stereotypical\npatterns of inference, combining semantic-ontological relations with types of reasoning and logical\naxioms and representing the abstract structure of the most common types of natural arguments. The\nargumentation schemes provided in (Walton, Reed & Macagno, 2008) describe tentatively the patterns\nof the most typical arguments. However, the two levels of abstraction are not distinguished. For this\nreason, under the label of \u201cargumentation schemes\u201d fall indistinctly patterns of reasoning such as the\nabductive, analogical, or inductive ones, and types of argument such as the ones from classification or\ncause to effect. A typical example is the argument from expert opinion, which has two premises and a\nconclusion.\nMajor Premise: Source E is an expert in subject domain S containing proposition A.\nMinor Premise: E asserts that proposition A is true (false).\nConclusion: A is true (false).\nEach scheme is associated to a set of critical questions, namely criteria for assessing dialectically the\nreasonableness and acceptability of an argument. The matching critical questions are the standard ways\nof casting the argument into doubt.\nCQ1: Expertise Question. How credible is E as an expert source?\nCQ2: Field Question. Is E an expert in the field that A is in?\nCQ3: Opinion Question. What did E assert that implies A?\nCQ4: Trustworthiness Question. Is E personally reliable as a source?\nCQ5: Consistency Question. Is A consistent with what other experts assert?\nCQ6: Backup Evidence Question. Is E's assertion based on evidence?\nIf an expert says that a proposition is true, this provides a reason for tentatively accepting it, in the\nabsence of stronger reasons to doubt it. But suppose that evidence of financial gain suggests that the\nexpert is biased, for example by evidence showing that he will gain financially from his claim.\nBy analogy\nArgument by analogy may be thought of as argument from the particular to particular. An argument by\nanalogy may use a particular truth in a premise to argue towards a similar particular truth in the\nconclusion. For example, if A. Plato was mortal, and B. Socrates was like Plato in other respects, then\nasserting that C. Socrates was mortal is an example of argument by analogy because the reasoning\nemployed in it proceeds from a particular truth in a premise (Plato was mortal) to a similar particular\ntruth in the conclusion, namely that Socrates was mortal.\nOther kinds\nOther kinds of arguments may have different or additional standards of validity or justification. For\nexample, Charles Taylor writes that so-called transcendental arguments are made up of a \"chain of\nindispensability claims\" that attempt to show why something is necessarily true based on its connection\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 7 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nto our experience, while Nikolas Kompridis has suggested that there are two types of \"fallible\"\narguments: one based on truth claims, and the other based on the time-responsive disclosure of\npossibility (see world disclosure). The late French philosopher Michel Foucault is said to have been a\nprominent advocate of this latter form of philosophical argument.\nIn informal logic\nArgument is an informal calculus, relating an effort to be performed or sum to be spent, to possible\nfuture gain, either economic or moral. In informal logic, an argument is a connexion between\na. an individual action\nb. through which a generally accepted good is obtained.\nEx :\n1.\na. You should marry Jane (individual action, individual decision)\nb. because she has the same temper as you. (generally accepted wisdom that marriage is\ngood in itself, and it is generally accepted that people with the same character get along\nwell).\n2.\na. You should not smoke (individual action, individual decision)\nb. because smoking is harmful (generally accepted wisdom that health is good).\nThe argument is neither a) advice nor b) moral or economical judgement, but the connection between\nthe two. An argument always uses the connective because. An argument is not an explanation. It does\nnot connect two events, cause and effect, which already took place, but a possible individual action and\nits beneficial outcome. An argument is not a proof. A proof is a logical and cognitive concept; an\nargument is a praxeologic concept. A proof changes our knowledge; an argument compels us to act.[]\nLogical status\nArgument does not belong to logic, because it is connected to a real person, a real event, and a real effort\nto be made.\n1. If you, John, will buy this stock, it will become twice as valuable in a year.\n2. If you, Mary, study dance, you will become a famous ballet dancer.\nThe value of the argument is connected to the immediate circumstances of the person spoken to. If, in\nthe first case,(1) John has no money, or will die the next year, he will not be interested in buying the\nstock. If, in the second case (2) she is too heavy, or too old, she will not be interested in studying and\nbecoming a dancer. The argument is not logical, but profitable.\nWorld-disclosing\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 8 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nWorld-disclosing arguments are a group of philosophical arguments that are said to employ a disclosive\napproach, to reveal features of a wider ontological or cultural-linguistic understanding \u2013 a \"world,\" in a\nspecifically ontological sense \u2013 in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and \"logical\nspace\" on which an argument implicitly depends.\nExplanations\nWhile arguments attempt to show that something was, is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try\nto show why or how something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of whether or not Fred's\ncat has fleas, Joe may state: \"Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe, the cat is scratching right now.\" Joe has\nmade an argument that the cat has fleas. However, if Joe asks Fred, \"Why is your cat scratching itself?\"\nthe explanation, \"...because it has fleas.\" provides understanding.\nBoth the above argument and explanation require knowing the generalities that a) fleas often cause\nitching, and b) that one often scratches to relieve itching. The difference is in the intent: an argument\nattempts to settle whether or not some claim is true, and an explanation attempts to provide\nunderstanding of the event. Note, that by subsuming the specific event (of Fred's cat scratching) as an\ninstance of the general rule that \"animals scratch themselves when they have fleas\", Joe will no longer\nwonder why Fred's cat is scratching itself. Arguments address problems of belief, explanations address\nproblems of understanding. Also note that in the argument above, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is\nup for debate (i.e. is a claim), but in the explanation, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is assumed to\nbe true (unquestioned at this time) and just needs explaining.\nArguments and explanations largely resemble each other in rhetorical use. This is the cause of much\ndifficulty in thinking critically about claims. There are several reasons for this difficulty.\n\u2022 People often are not themselves clear on whether they are arguing for or explaining something.\n\u2022 The same types of words and phrases are used in presenting explanations and arguments.\n\u2022 The terms 'explain' or 'explanation,' et cetera are frequently used in arguments.\n\u2022 Explanations are often used within arguments and presented so as to serve as arguments.\n\u2022 Likewise, \"...arguments are essential to the process of justifying the validity of any explanation\nas there are often multiple explanations for any given phenomenon.\"\nExplanations and arguments are often studied in the field of Information Systems to help explain user\nacceptance of knowledge-based systems. Certain argument types may fit better with personality traits to\nenhance acceptance by individuals.\nFallacies and nonarguments\nFallacies are types of argument or expressions which are held to be of an invalid form or contain errors\nin reasoning. There is not as yet any general theory of fallacy or strong agreement among researchers of\ntheir definition or potential for application but the term is broadly applicable as a label to certain\nexamples of error, and also variously applied to ambiguous candidates.\nIn Logic types of fallacy are firmly described thus: First the premises and the conclusion must be\nstatements, capable of being true or false. Secondly it must be asserted that the conclusion follows from\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 9 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nthe premises. In English the words therefore, so, because and hence typically separate the premises from\nthe conclusion of an argument, but this is not necessarily so. Thus: Socrates is a man, all men are mortal\ntherefore Socrates is mortal is clearly an argument (a valid one at that), because it is clear it is asserted\nthat Socrates is mortal follows from the preceding statements. However I was thirsty and therefore I\ndrank is NOT an argument, despite its appearance. It is not being claimed that I drank is logically\nentailed by I was thirsty. The therefore in this sentence indicates for that reason not it follows that.\nElliptical arguments\nOften an argument is invalid because there is a missing premise\u2014the supply of which would render it\nvalid. Speakers and writers will often leave out a strictly necessary premise in their reasonings if it is\nwidely accepted and the writer does not wish to state the blindingly obvious. Example: All metals\nexpand when heated, therefore iron will expand when heated. (Missing premise: iron is a metal). On the\nother hand, a seemingly valid argument may be found to lack a premise \u2013 a 'hidden assumption' \u2013 which\nif highlighted can show a fault in reasoning. Example: A witness reasoned: Nobody came out the front\ndoor except the milkman; therefore the murderer must have left by the back door. (Hidden assumptions-\nthe milkman was not the murderer, and the murderer has left by the front or back door).\nUNIT ONE: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LOGIC? 10 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n1\nIntroduction and The Ship of Theseus\nArguments1\nThe goal of a critical thinking course is to enable you to understand and analyze arguments. By the end\nof the course you should be able to recognize such arguments and determine if they are good (i.e. if a\nrational person, upon hearing such an argument, should be convinced by it.)\n1. Basics of Argumentation\nArgument: An attempt to convince, using reasons2. An argument consists of two parts:\nA conclusion, which is the sentence that the argument is arguing for, or that part of the argument\nthat the arguer is trying to convince you of. The conclusion is always a claim.\nThe premises. These are sentences that are supposed to support, lead to, provide evidence for, prove\nor convince that the conclusion is true. An argument is an attempt to convince someone (though not\nnecessarily someone in particular) that a certain claim is true.\nFor example, this is an argument:\nMr. Johnson\u2019s fingerprints, and only Mr. Johnson\u2019s fingerprints, were found at the crime scene. A\nknife was found on Mr. Johnson\u2019s person, and it matched the wounds on the victim, and contained\ntraces of the victim\u2019s blood. Mr. Johnson\u2019s cellmate testified that Mr. Johnson confessed to the\ncrime, and hidden cameras recorded this confession. Therefore, Mr. Johnson is guilty.\nThe last sentence is the conclusion. The other sentences are premises. Here\u2019s another:\nWhen I left the house there was cake in the refrigerator. You\u2019re the only other person with a key to\nthe house, and now the cake is gone. So you ate the cake.\nAgain, the last sentence is the conclusion, the others are premises. Here\u2019s another:\nYou should complete your college education. People who graduate from college not only earn, on\naverage, more money than college dropouts, they also report much higher levels of satisfaction in\nlife.\nIn this case, the first sentence is the conclusion, and the rest are premises. You should be able to note\n1 This section reprinted from: DiGiovanna, James. 2013. Introduction to Critical Thinking. Used here under a CC-BY-SA-\nNC license.\n2 This definition comes from Epstein, Critical Thinking\n1 Introduction and The Ship of Theseus 11 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nthis because the other sentences give reasons that you should accept the first sentence. That is, they act\nas premises, or evidence, for the conclusion. Another way to see that this is the conclusion is to ask\nyourself: what is the person trying to convince me of? It\u2019s not \u201ccollege graduates earn more money.\u201d\nHe\u2019s telling me that without any evidence. But, if that\u2019s true, that\u2019s a reason to graduate from college.\nIn other words, it\u2019s a premise. The premise is presented as evidence for the conclusion.\nThe Ship of Theseus3\nThe ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus' paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of\nwhether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.\nThe paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch\nasked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same\nship.\nThe paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato prior to\nPlutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known,\nincluding the grandfather's axe, which has had both head and handle replaced.\nVariations of the paradox\nAncient philosophy\nThis particular version of the paradox was first introduced in Greek legend as reported by the historian,\nbiographer, and essayist Plutarch,\n\u201cThe ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was\npreserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old\nplanks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship\nbecame a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one\nside holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.\u201d\n\u2014 Plutarch, Theseus\nPlutarch thus questions whether the ship would remain the same if it were entirely replaced, piece by\npiece. Centuries later, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes introduced a further puzzle, wondering what\nwould happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a\nsecond ship. Hobbes asked which ship, if either, would be the original Ship of Theseus.\nModern era\nJohn Locke proposed a scenario regarding a favorite sock that develops a hole. He pondered whether the\nsock would still be the same after a patch was applied to the hole, and if it would be the same sock after\na second patch was applied, and a third, etc., until all of the material of the original sock has been\nreplaced with patches.\n3 This section is reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

In some Spanish-speaking\ncountries, Jeannot's knife is present as a proverb, though referred to simply as \"the family knife\". The\nprinciple, however, remains the same.\nA Hungarian version of the story features \"Lajos Kossuth's pocket knife\", having its blade and handle\ncontinuously replaced but still being referred to as the very knife of the famous statesman. As a\nproverbial expression it is used for objects or solutions being repeatedly renewed and gradually replaced\nto an extent that it has no original parts.\nA comedic version of the story appears in the popular TV sitcom Only Fools and Horses, in which the\ncharacter Trigger explains that his broom... \"has had 17 new heads and 14 new handles in it's time\".\nOne version is often discussed in introductory Jurisprudence and Evidence classes in law school,\ndiscussing whether a weapon used in a murder, for example, would still be considered the \"murder\nweapon\" if both its handle and head/blade were to be replaced at separate, subsequent times. (Perhaps\nyes if the issue is whether tracing the history of 'its' possession may lead one back to the murderer;\nperhaps no if the issue is whether fingerprints from the murder may still be on 'it'. This shows how a\nphilosophical paradox can be resolved, perhaps in different ways in different contexts, when converted\ninto a question about the physical world. Likewise mathematical paradoxes in physics, for example the\nsignificance of whether or not a number is rational in Hofstadter's butterfly.)\nIn popular culture\nThe paradox appears in various forms in fictional contexts, particularly in fantasy or science-fiction, for\nexample where a character has body parts swapped for artificial replacements until the person has been\nentirely replaced. There are many other variations with reference to the same concept in popular culture\nfor example axes and brooms.\nProposed resolutions\nHeraclitus\nThe Greek philosopher Heraclitus attempted to solve the paradox by introducing the idea of a river\nwhere water replenishes it. Arius Didymus quoted him as saying \"upon those who step into the same\nrivers, different and again different waters flow\". Plutarch disputed Heraclitus' claim about stepping\ntwice into the same river, citing that it cannot be done because \"it scatters and again comes together, and\napproaches and recedes\".\n1 Introduction and The Ship of Theseus 13 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nAristotle's causes\nAccording to the philosophical system of Aristotle and his followers, four causes or reasons describe a\nthing; these causes can be analyzed to get to a solution to the paradox. The formal cause or 'form'\n(perhaps best parsed as the cause of an object's form or of its having that form) is the design of a thing,\nwhile the material cause is the matter of which the thing is made. Another of Aristotle's causes is the\n'end' or final cause, which is the intended purpose of a thing. The ship of Theseus would have the same\nends, those being, mythically, transporting Theseus, and politically, convincing the Athenians that\nTheseus was once a living person, though its material cause would change with time. The efficient cause\nis how and by whom a thing is made, for example, how artisans fabricate and assemble something; in\nthe case of the ship of Theseus, the workers who built the ship in the first place could have used the\nsame tools and techniques to replace the planks in the ship.\nAccording to Aristotle, the \"what-it-is\" of a thing is its formal cause, so the ship of Theseus is the 'same'\nship, because the formal cause, or design, does not change, even though the matter used to construct it\nmay vary with time. In the same manner, for Heraclitus's paradox, a river has the same formal cause,\nalthough the material cause (the particular water in it) changes with time, and likewise for the person\nwho steps in the river.\nThis argument's validity and soundness as applied to the paradox depend on the accuracy not only of\nAristotle's expressed premise that an object's formal cause is not only the primary or even sole\ndeterminer of its defining characteristic(s) or essence (\"what-it-is\") but also of the unstated, stronger\npremise that an object's formal cause is the sole determiner of its identity or \"which-it-is\" (i.e., whether\nthe previous and the later ships or rivers are the \"same\" ship or river). This latter premise is subject to\nattack by indirect proof using arguments such as \"Suppose two ships are built using the same design and\nexist at the same time until one sinks the other in battle. Clearly the two ships are not the same ship even\nbefore, let alone after, one sinks the other, and yet the two have the same formal cause; therefore, formal\ncause cannot by itself suffice to determine an object's identity\" or \" [...] therefore, two objects' or object-\ninstances' having the same formal cause does not by itself suffice to make them the same object or prove\nthat they are the same object.\"\nDefinitions of \"the same\"\nOne common argument found in the philosophical literature is that in the case of Heraclitus' river one is\ntripped up by two different definitions of \"the same\". In one sense, things can be \"qualitatively\nidentical\", by sharing some properties. In another sense, they might be \"numerically identical\" by being\n\"one\". As an example, consider two different marbles that look identical. They would be qualitatively,\nbut not numerically, identical. A marble can be numerically identical only to itself.\nNote that some languages differentiate between these two forms of identity. In German, for example,\n\"gleich\" (\"equal\") and \"selbe\" (\"self-same\") are the pertinent terms, respectively. At least in formal\nspeech, the former refers to qualitative identity (e.g. die gleiche Murmel, \"the same [qualitative]\nmarble\") and the latter to numerical identity (e.g. die selbe Murmel, \"the same [numerical] marble\").\nColloquially, \"gleich\" is also used in place of \"selbe\", however.\n1 Introduction and The Ship of Theseus 14 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nFour-dimensionalism\nTed Sider and others have proposed that considering objects to extend across time as four-dimensional\ncausal series of three-dimensional \"time-slices\" could solve the ship of Theseus problem because, in\ntaking such an approach, each time-slice and all four dimensional objects remain numerically identical\nto themselves while allowing individual time-slices to differ from each other. The aforementioned river,\ntherefore, comprises different three-dimensional time-slices of itself while remaining numerically\nidentical to itself across time; one can never step into the same river-time-slice twice, but one can step\ninto the same (four-dimensional) river twice.\nIn Japan\nIn Japan, Shinto shrines are rebuilt every twenty years with entirely \"new wood\". The continuity over\nthe centuries is spiritual and comes from the source of the wood in the case of the Ise Jingu's Naiku\nshrine, which is harvested from an adjoining forest that is considered sacred. The shrine has currently\nbeen rebuilt 62 times.\n1 Introduction and The Ship of Theseus 15 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n2\nWhat is Logic?\nWhat is Logic?1\nIn Logic, the object of study is reasoning. This is an activity that humans engage in\u2014when we make\nclaims and back them up with reasons, or when we make inferences about what follows from a set of\nstatements.\nLike many human activities, reasoning can be done well, or it can be done badly. The goal of logic is to\ndistinguish good reasoning from bad. Good reasoning is not necessarily effective reasoning; in fact, as\nwe shall see, bad reasoning is pervasive and often extremely effective\u2014in the sense that people are\noften persuaded by it. In Logic, the standard of goodness is not effectiveness in the sense of\npersuasiveness, but rather correctness according to logical rules.\nIn logic, we study the rules and techniques that allow us to distinguish good, correct reasoning from bad,\nincorrect reasoning.\nSince there is a variety of different types of reasoning, since it\u2019s possible to develop various methods for\nevaluating each of those types, and since there are different views on what constitutes correct reasoning,\nthere are many approaches to the logical enterprise. We talk of logic, but also of logics. A logic is just a\nset of rules and techniques for distinguishing good reasoning from bad. There are many logics; the\npurpose of this book is to give an overview of some of the most basic ones.\nSo, the object of study in logic is human reasoning, with the goal of distinguishing the good from the\nbad. It is important to note that this approach sets logic apart from an alternative way of studying human\nreasoning, one more proper to a different discipline: psychology. It is possible to study human reasoning\nin a merely descriptive mode: to identify common patterns of reasoning and explore their psychological\ncauses, for example. This is not logic. Logic takes up reasoning in a prescriptive mode: it tells how we\nought to reason, not merely how we in fact typically do.2\nBasic Notions: Propositions and Arguments\nReasoning involves claims or statements\u2014making them and backing them up with reasons, drawing out\ntheir consequences. Propositions are the things we claim, state, assert.\nPropositions are the kinds of things that can be true or false. They are expressed by declarative\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 Psychologists have determined, for example, that most people are subject to what is called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\u2014a\ntendency to seek out information to confirm one\u2019s pre-existing beliefs, and ignore contradictory evidence. There are\nlots of studies on this effect, including even brain-scans of people engaged in evaluating evidence. All of this is very\ninteresting, but it\u2019s psychology, not logic; it\u2019s a mere descriptive study of reasoning. From a logical, prescriptive point\nof view, we simply say that people should try to avoid confirmation bias, because it can lead to bad reasoning.\n2 What is Logic? 16 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nsentences.3 \u2018This book is boring\u2019 is a declarative sentence; it expresses the proposition that this book is\nboring, which is (arguably) true (at least so far\u2014but it\u2019s only the first page; wait until later, when things\nget exciting!).\nOther kinds of sentences do not express propositions. Imperative sentences issue commands: \u2018Sit down\nand shut up\u2019 is an imperative sentence; it doesn\u2019t make a claim, express something that might be true or\nfalse; either it\u2019s obeyed or it isn\u2019t. Interrogative sentences ask questions: \u2018Who will win the World Cup\nthis year?\u2019 is an interrogative sentence; it does not assert anything that might be true or false either.\nOnly declarative sentences express propositions, and so they are the only kinds of sentences we will deal\nwith at this stage of the study of logic. (More advanced logics have been developed to deal with\nimperatives and questions, but we won\u2019t look at those in an introductory textbook.)\nThe fundamental unit of reasoning is the argument. In logic, by \u2018argument\u2019 we don\u2019t mean a\ndisagreement, a shouting match; rather, we define the term precisely:\nArgument = a set of propositions, one of which, the conclusion, is (supposed to be) supported by\nthe others, the premises.\nIf we\u2019re reasoning by making claims and backing them up with reasons, then the claim that\u2019s being\nbacked up is the conclusion of an argument; the reasons given to support it are the argument\u2019s premises.\nIf we\u2019re reasoning by drawing an inference from a set of statements, then the inference we draw is the\nconclusion of an argument, and the statements from which its drawn are the premises.\nWe include the parenthetical hedge\u2014\u201csupposed to be\u201d\u2014in the definition to make room for bad\narguments. Remember, in Logic, we\u2019re evaluating reasoning. Arguments can be good or bad, logically\ncorrect or incorrect. A bad argument, very roughly speaking, is one where the premises fail to support\nthe conclusion; a good argument\u2019s premises actually do support the conclusion.\nTo support the conclusion means, again very roughly, to give one good reasons for believing it. This\nhighlights the rhetorical purpose of arguments: we use arguments when we\u2019re disputing controversial\nissues; they aim to persuade people, to convince them to believe their conclusion.4 As we said, in logic,\nwe don\u2019t judge arguments based on whether or not they succeed in this goal\u2014 there are logically bad\narguments that are nevertheless quite persuasive. Rather, the logical enterprise is to identify the kinds of\nreasons that ought to be persuasive (even if they sometimes aren\u2019t).\nClaims5\n3 We distinguish propositions from the sentences that express them because a single proposition can be expressed by\ndifferent sentences. \u2018It\u2019s raining\u2019 and \u2018Es regnet\u2019 both express the proposition that it\u2019s raining; one sentence does it in\nEnglish, the other in German. Also, \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 and \u2018Mary is loved by John\u2019 both express the same proposition.\n4 Reasoning in the sense of drawing inferences from a set of statements is a special case of this persuasive activity.\nWhen we draw out reasonable conclusions from given information, we\u2019re convincing ourselves that we have good\nreasons to believe them.\n5 This section reprinted from: DiGiovanna, James. 2013. Introduction to Critical Thinking. Used here under a CC-BY-SA-\nNC license.\n2 What is Logic? 17 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nOnly certain sorts of sentences can be used in arguments. We call these sentences propositions,\nstatements or claims.\nStatements or claims have the following characteristics:\nThey are either true or false.\nThey are declarative (that is to say, they are not questions or commands; they are sentences that\ndescribe how things are, were, will be, would be, could be or should be.)\nThey are clearly written or stated such that there is no ambiguity as to their meaning (i.e. they\ndon\u2019t have two or more highly distinct interpretations, as in sentences like \u201cI saw the\nwaiter with the glasses\u201d) and they are not so vague as to make it impossible to say under\nwhat conditions they would be true.\nThere are lots of ways for a sentence to fail to be a claim, just as there are a lot of way for a\nsentence to fail to be a question, or description of a dog, or a command.\nWhich of the following are claims:\n1. All dogs have four legs.\n2. John F. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States.\n3. Don\u2019t go into Central Park at night.\n4. Why do people always talk on their cell phones on the J train?\n5. Barack Obama is very tall.\n6. There is life on other planets.\nAnswers:\n1. Is a claim. It\u2019s false (there are dogs that have lost a leg, thus three-legged dogs.) The fact that it\u2019s false\nmeans that it must be a claim. ONLY claims can be false.\n2. Is a claim. It\u2019s true. The fact that it\u2019s true means that it must be a claim. ONLY claims can be true.\n3. Not a claim. It is a command; it is neither true nor false (though it might be good advice.)\n4. Not a claim. It is a question. Questions are never true or false, though sometimes they imply claims.\n5. Not a claim. \u201cVery tall\u201d is too vague. We have no standard, agreed upon method for determining if\nsomeone is \u201cvery tall.\u201d By Danish standards (where the average male height is 5\u201911\u201d) Obama is\nprobably not \u201cvery\u201d tall. By Vietnamese standards (where the average male is 5\u20194\u201d) Obama might well\nbe considered \u201cvery\u201d tall. We could turn this sentence into a claim by changing it to \u201cPresident Obama\nis 6\u20192\u201d tall.\u201d\n2 What is Logic? 18 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n6. This is a claim, but we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not. Still, it\u2019s clearly either true or false, so it must be\na claim.\nSubjective and Objective claims\nClaims are either subjective or objective. These words have a special, technical sense in philosophy. A\nclaim is subjective if it is about thoughts, feelings, or other internal states of the mind. A claim is\nobjective if it is about something that is not dependent on a state of the mind. It\u2019s important to keep in\nmind that you might have used \u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d differently from this, and like all words\nthese have multiple senses. For our purposes, though, we\u2019ll be using subjective and objective only of\nclaims, because only claims are true or false, and here subjective and objective describe something\nabout the truth conditions for a claim.\nThe truth condition for a claim is whatever it would take to make that claim true. For example, if you\nsaid, \u201cIt is snowing right now outside my window!\u201d that claim is true if, and only if, at the moment you\nsay it, it is in fact snowing outside your window. The snow falling outside your window constitutes the\ntruth condition for the claim. Importantly, it\u2019s not that you saw it snow, or that someone reliable told\nyou it was snowing, that makes the claim true. Those might count as evidence, that is, reason to believe\nit is snowing. But it\u2019s the actual falling snow that makes the claim true, and is the claim\u2019s truth\ncondition. One way to think of this is on the analogy of a court of law. You could be on a jury and hear\ntestimony and see evidence that convinces you that the defendant is guilty of the crime. But your belief\nthat \u201cMr. Johnson murdered Mr. Ono\u201d comes from the evidence, the truth of the claim comes from Mr.\nJohnson actually having murdered Mr. Ono. You could, in other words, have compelling evidence but\nbe wrong. In fact, it\u2019s possible that no one will ever know if Mr. Johnson murdered Mr. Ono (perhaps\nMr. Johnson blacked out and lost memory of what occurred during Mr. Ono\u2019s death), but the claim is\ntrue or false regardless of who believes it. The claims \u201cMr. Johnson murdered Mr. Ono,\u201d and \u201cit is\nsnowing right now outside my window\u201d are objective claims because their truth conditions are not\nfound in anyone\u2019s thoughts of feelings or mental content; they exist independently of what anyone\nthinks or feels.\nWhereas, for example, \u201cI'm itchy,\u201d is a subjective claim. \u201cI feel hot,\u201d \u201cJohn is tired,\u201d \u201cAnita loves\nKeyshawn,\u201d \u201cThomas believes in God,\u201d and \u201cThe Black Keys are my favorite band,\u201d are all subjective\nclaims. This is because their truth or falsity depends upon what someone thinks or feels, or, we can say,\nthe truth conditions for these claims are found in someone\u2019s mental content. If I say, \u201cI feel nauseated,\u201d\nthat claim is true if, and only if, I actually have the feeling of nausea, and false if, and only if, I do not\nhave that feeling. So if I\u2019m trying to get out of doing something, I might say \u201cI feel nauseated\u201d when I\nhad no such feeling, that is to say, when the truth condition does not exist.\nThe following claims are objective: \u201cDan is six feet tall,\u201d \u201cThe Empire state building is made of\ncheese,\u201d \u201cNew York is the largest city in the United States,\u201d and \u201cGod exists.\u201d In each of these cases,\nthough I might have a subjective belief about the claim, the actual truth condition is external to my\nthoughts and feelings.\nNote that the second claim is a false objective claim. The Empire State Building is not made of cheese.\nBut the truth or falsity of the claim is independent of what anyone thinks or feels. It's a fact about the\n2 What is Logic? 19 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nworld outside of our minds. Similarly, \u201cGod exists\u201d is an objective claim. Some people believe it to be\ntrue, some people believe it to be false, but their beliefs do not make the claim true or false any more\nthan one's belief that New York is the largest city in the world would make that claim true. God exists,\nor fails to exist, whether or not we believe or think that God exists. However, if I said, \u201cI believe that\nGod exists,\u201d that would be a subjective claim. In fact, any objective claim can be turned into a\nsubjective claim by prefixing the words \u201cI think that\u2026\u201d or \u201cI believe that\u2026\u201d to it. That\u2019s because the\ntruth conditions for \u201cI believe there is butter in the refrigerator\u201d are found in my (and only my) beliefs,\nregardless of whether there is butter in the refrigerator, whereas the claim \u201cthere is butter in the\nrefrigerator\u201d is true if, and only if, there is butter in the refrigerator, regardless of what I believe.\nNotably, truth is a very complex philosophical topic, and there are interesting disputes about its nature.\nBut at the basic level, pretty much everyone working on the topic agrees that the claim \u201cthere is a dog on\nmy bed,\u201d is true if and only if there is a dog on my bed. That is, there is general agreement about the\nneed for truth conditions (which, minimally, means that there is always some difference between a true\nclaim and a false claim.) For our purposes, then, we\u2019ll divide claims up as subjective or objective\ndepending on the nature of their truth conditions.\nFor the following claims, say if they are subjective or objective:\n1. There are over 1200 species of beetles in the world today.\n2. The Yankees will win the World Series in 2034.\n3. Alissa's head hurts.\n4. I'm tired of hearing about the economy.\n5. There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet.\n6. There are over 9 billion people living in Brooklyn.\nAnswers: 1 is an objective claim. 2 is also objective: though it refers to a future event, it's not the case\nthat our thoughts or feelings can make it true or false; we just have to wait to see if it's true or false. Its\ntruth conditions will be independent of thought or feeling. Some hold that it is temporarily neither true\nnor false; most philosophers, though, hold that claims about the future are true or false but that the truth\nconditions are simply placed at a different point in time from the claim\u2019s utterance. 3 is subjective: it\nrefers to a feeling that Alissa has. 4 is subjective; it refers to a feeling or thought had by the speaker. 5 is\nobjective: many people believe it to be true, many others do not, but it's true if and only if there is, in\nfact, one God, that God's name is Allah, and Mohammed is the prophet of that God. My thoughts or\nfeelings on this cannot alter its truth value. 6 is objective: there are not, in fact, 9 billion people living in\nBrooklyn, and we can ascertain that by counting, looking at the census, or just noting the impossibility\nof getting 9 billion people into the existing housing in Brooklyn.\nNote: we distinguish subjective from objective claims to aid in argumentation and conversation.\nGenerally, we have to be very careful about giving subjective premises for an objective conclusion. \u201cI\n2 What is Logic? 20 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nfeel like God exists\u201d or \u201cI feel like Sarmatians are sneaky people\u201d are probably not good premises for\nthe conclusions \u201cGod exists\u201d or \u201cSarmatians are sneaky people.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand that, if someone makes an objective claim, we can\u2019t respond with\n\u201cthat\u2019s true for you but not for me.\u201d Objective claims, by their nature, are not true relative to some\nperson. An objective claim can be false, but it can\u2019t be simply relative to a person\u2019s beliefs\u2014if it is, it\u2019s\nnot an objective claim. Further, just because a claim is controversial does not make it subjective! Most\nof the truly controversial claims are objective. We don\u2019t develop a lot of controversy over claims like \u201cI\nfeel tired,\u201d but there is a great deal of debate over claims like \u201cThere is only one God and He is the\ncreator of the world.\u201d\nFinally, when someone makes a subjective claim but states it as though it were an objective claim, this\ncan cause needless disagreement. If Tammy says \u201cBeyonce is the best singer in the world,\u201d she probably\njust means that Beyonce is her favorite singer. If Lamar responds with \u201cno way, Taylor Swift is the best\nsinger!\u201d they could be on the verge of a pointless disagreement. There is no standard for \u201cbest singer in\nthe world,\u201d so there\u2019s no settling this by argument. Instead, recognizing that Tammy was actually\nmaking a subjective claim, Lamar might ask, \u201creally, what do you like about Beyonce\u2019s singing?\u201d\n2 What is Logic? 21 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n3\nRecognizing Arguments1\nBefore we get down to the business of evaluating arguments\u2014deciding whether they\u2019re good or bad\u2014\nwe need to develop some preliminary analytical skills. The first of these is, simply, the ability to\nrecognize arguments when we see them, and to figure out what the conclusion is (and what the premises\nare).\nWhat we want to learn first is how to explicate arguments. This involves writing down a bunch of\ndeclarative sentences that express the propositions in the argument, and clearly marking which of these\nsentences expresses the conclusion.\nLet\u2019s start with a simple example. Here\u2019s an argument:\nYou really shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s. Why? First of all, they pay their workers very low\nwages. Second, the animals that go into their products are raised in deplorable, inhumane\nconditions. Third, the food is really bad for you. Finally, the burgers have poop in them.2\nThe passage is clearly argumentative: its purpose is to convince you of something, namely, that you\nshouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s. That\u2019s the conclusion of the argument. The other claims are all reasons for\nbelieving the conclusion\u2014reasons for not eating at McDonald\u2019s. Those are the premises.\nTo explicate the argument is simply to clearly identify the premises and the conclusion, by writing down\ndeclarative sentences that express them. We would explicate the McDonald\u2019s argument like this:\nMcDonald\u2019s pays its workers very low wages.\nThe animals that go into their products are raised in deplorable, inhumane conditions.\nMcDonald\u2019s food is really bad for you.\nTheir burgers have poop in them.\n/\u2234 You shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s.\nWe separate the conclusion from the premises with a horizontal line, and we put a special symbol in\nfront of the conclusion, which can be read as \u201ctherefore.\u201d\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 I know, I know. But it\u2019s almost certainly true. Consumer Reports conducted a study in 2015, in which they tested 458\npounds of ground beef, purchased from 103 different stores in 26 different cities; all of the 458 pounds were contaminated\nwith fecal matter. This is because most commercial ground beef is produced at facilities that process thousands of animals,\nand do it very quickly. The quickness ensures that sometimes\u2014rarely, but sometimes\u2014a knifecut goes astray and the\ngastrointestinal tract is nicked, releasing poop. It gets cleaned up, but again, things are moving fast, so they don\u2019t quite get all\nthe poop. Now you\u2019ve got one carcass\u2014again, out of hundreds or thousands\u2014 contaminated with feces. But they make\nground beef in a huge vat, with meat from all those carcasses mixed together. So even one accident like this contaminates the\nwhole batch. So yeah, those burgers\u2014basically all burgers, unless you\u2019re grinding your own meat or sourcing your beef from\na local farm\u2014have poop in them. Not much, but it\u2019s there. Of course, it won\u2019t make you sick as long as you cook it right:\n160\u00b0 F is enough to kill the poop-bacteria (E-coli, etc.), so, you know, no big deal. Except for the knowledge that you\u2019re\neating poop. Sorry.\n3 Recognizing Arguments 22 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nSpeaking of \u2018therefore\u2019, it\u2019s one of the words to look out for when identifying and explicating\narguments. Along with words like \u2018consequently\u2019 and \u2018thus\u2019, and phrases like \u2018it follows that\u2019 and\n\u2018which implies that\u2019, it indicates the presence of the conclusion of an argument. Similarly, words like\n\u2018because\u2019, \u2018since\u2019, and \u2018for\u2019 indicate the presence of premises.\nWe should also note that it is possible for a single sentence to express more than one proposition. If we\nadded this sentence to our argument\u2014\u2018McDonald\u2019s advertising targets children to try to create lifetime\naddicts to their high-calorie foods, and their expansion into global markets has disrupted native food\ndistribution systems, harming family farmers\u2019\u2014we would write down two separate declarative\nsentences in our explication, expressing the two propositions asserted in the sentence\u2014about children\nand international farmers, respectively. Indeed, it\u2019s possible for a single sentence to express an entire\nargument. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s because they\u2019re a bad corporate actor\u2019 gives you a\nconclusion and a premise at once. An explication would merely separate them.\nParaphrasing\nThe argument about McDonald\u2019s was an easy case. It didn\u2019t have a word like \u2018therefore\u2019 to tip us off to\nthe presence of the conclusion, but it was pretty clear what the conclusion was anyway. All we had to\ndo was ask ourselves, \u201cWhat is this person trying to convince me to believe?\u201d The answer to that\nquestion is the conclusion of the argument.\nAnother way the McDonald\u2019s argument was easy: all of the sentences were declarative sentences, so\nwhen we explicated the argument, all we had to do was write them down. But sometimes argumentative\npassages aren\u2019t so cooperative. Sometimes they contain non-declarative sentences. Recall, arguments\nare sets of propositions, and only declarative sentences express propositions; so if an argumentative\npassage contains non-declarative sentences (questions, commands, etc.), we need to change their\nwording when we explicate the argument, turning them into declarative sentences that express a\nproposition. This is called paraphrasing.\nSuppose, for example, that the McDonald\u2019s argument were exactly as originally presented, except the\nfirst sentence were imperative, not declarative:\nDon\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s. Why? First of all, they pay their workers very low wages. Second, the\nanimals that go into their products are raised in deplorable, inhumane conditions. Third, the food\nis really bad for you. Finally, the burgers have poop in them.\nWe just switched from \u2018You shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s\u2019 to \u2018Don\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s.\u2019 But it makes a\ndifference. The first sentence is declarative; it makes a claim about how things are (morally, with\nrespect to your obligations in some sense): you shouldn\u2019t do such-and-such. It\u2019s possible to disagree\nwith the claim: Sure I should, and so should everybody else; their fries are delicious! \u2018Don\u2019t eat at\nMcDonald\u2019s\u2019, on the other hand, is not like that. It\u2019s a command. It\u2019s possible to disobey it, but not to\ndisagree with it; imperative sentences don\u2019t make claims about how things are, don\u2019t express\npropositions.\nStill, the passage is clearly argumentative: the purpose remains to persuade the listener not to eat at\n3 Recognizing Arguments 23 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nMcDonald\u2019s. We just have to be careful, when we explicate the argument, to paraphrase the first\nsentence\u2014to change its wording so that it becomes a declarative, proposition-expressing sentence. \u2018You\nshouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s\u2019 works just fine.\nLet\u2019s consider a different example:\nI can\u2019t believe anyone would support a $15 per hour minimum wage. Don\u2019t they realize that it\nwould lead to massive job losses? And the strain such a policy would put on small businesses\ncould lead to an economic recession.\nThe passage is clearly argumentative: this person is engaged in a dispute about a controversial issue\u2014\nthe minimum wage\u2014and is staking out a position and backing it up. What is that position? Apparently,\nthis person opposes the idea of raising the minimum wage to $15.\nThere are two problems we face in explicating this argument. First, one of the sentences in the\npassage\u2014the second one\u2014is non-declarative: it\u2019s an interrogative sentence, a question. Nevertheless,\nit\u2019s being used in this passage to express one of the person\u2019s reasons for opposing the minimum wage\nincrease\u2014that it would lead to job losses. So we need to paraphrase, transforming the interrogative into\na declarative\u2014something like \u2018A $15 minimum wage would lead to massive job losses\u2019.\nThe other problem is that the first sentence, while a perfectly respectable declarative sentence, can\u2019t be\nused as-is in our explication. For while it\u2019s clearly being used by to express this person\u2019s main point, the\nconclusion of his argument against the minimum wage increase, it does so indirectly. What the sentence\nliterally and directly expresses is not a claim about the wisdom of the minimum wage increase, but\nrather a claim about the speaker\u2019s personal beliefs: \u2018I can\u2019t believe anyone would support a $15 per hour\nminimum wage\u2019. But that claim isn\u2019t the conclusion of the argument. The speaker isn\u2019t trying to\nconvince people that he believes (or can\u2019t believe) a certain thing; he\u2019s trying to convince them to\nbelieve the same thing he believes, namely, that raising the minimum wage to $15 is a bad idea. So,\ndespite the first sentence being a declarative, we still have to paraphrase it. It expresses a proposition,\nbut not the conclusion of the argument.\nOur explication of the argument would look like this:\nIncreasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour would lead to massive job losses.\nThe policy would put a strain on small businesses that might lead to a recession.\n/\u2234 Increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour is a bad idea.\nEnthymemes: Tacit Propositions\nSo sometimes, when we explicate an argument, we have to take what\u2019s present in the argumentative\npassage and change it slightly, so that all of the sentences we write down express the propositions that\nare in the argument. This is paraphrasing. Other times, we have to do even more: occasionally, we have\nto fill in missing propositions; argumentative passages might not state all of the propositions in an\nargument explicitly, and in the course of explicating their arguments, we have to make these implicit,\ntacit propositions explicit by writing down the appropriate declarative sentences.\n3 Recognizing Arguments 24 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nThere\u2019s a fancy Greek word for argumentative passages that leave certain propositions unstated:\nenthymemes. Here\u2019s an example:\nHillary Clinton has more experience in public office than Donald Trump; she has a much deeper\nknowledge of the issues; she\u2019s the only one with the proper temperament to lead our country. I\nrest my case.\nAgain, the argumentative intentions here are plain: this person is staking out a position on a\ncontroversial topic\u2014a presidential election. But notice, that position\u2014that one should prefer Clinton to\nTrump\u2014is never stated explicitly. We get reasons for having that preference\u2014the premises of the\nargument are explicit\u2014but we never get a statement of the conclusion. But since this is clearly the\nupshot of the passage, we need to include a sentence expressing it in our explication:\nClinton has more experience than Trump.\nClinton has deeper knowledge of issues than Trump.\nClinton has the proper temperament to lead the country, while Trump does not.\n/\u2234 One should prefer Clinton to Trump in the presidential election.\nIn that example, the conclusion of the argument was tacit. Sometimes, premises are unstated and we\nshould make them explicit in our explication of the argument. Now consider this passage:\nThe sad fact is that wages for middle-class workers have stagnated over the past several decades.\nWe need a resurgence of the union movement in this country.\nThis person is arguing in favor of labor unions; the second sentence is the conclusion of the argument.\nThe first sentence gives the only explicit premise: the stagnation of middle-class wages. But notice what\nthe passage doesn\u2019t say: what connection there might be between the two things. What do unions have\nto do with middle-class wages?\nThere\u2019s an implicit premise lurking in the background here\u2014something that hasn\u2019t been said, but which\nneeds to be true for the argument to go through. We need a claim that connects the premise to the\nconclusion\u2014that bridges the gap between them. Something like this: A resurgence of unions would lead\nto wage growth for middle-class workers. The first sentence identifies a problem; the second sentence\npurports to give a solution to the problem. But it\u2019s only a solution if the tacit premise we\u2019ve uncovered\nis true. If unions don\u2019t help raise middle-class wages, then the argument falls apart.\nThis is the mark of the kinds of tacit premises we want to uncover: if they\u2019re false, they undermine the\nargument. Often, premises like this are unstated for a reason: they\u2019re controversial claims on their own,\nrequiring a lot of evidence to support them; so the arguer leaves them out, preferring not to get bogged\ndown. When we draw them out, however, we can force a more robust dialectical exchange, focusing the\nargument on the heart of the matter. In this case, a discussion about the connection between unions and\nmiddle-class wages would be in order. There\u2019s a lot to be said on that topic.\nArguments vs. Explanations\n3 Recognizing Arguments 25 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nOne final item on the topic of \u201cRecognizing and Explicating Arguments.\u201d We\u2019ve been focusing on\nexplication; this is a remark about the recognition side. Some passages may superficially resemble\narguments\u2014they may, for example, contain words like \u2018therefore\u2019 and \u2018because\u2019, which normally\nindicate conclusions and premises in argumentative passages\u2014but which are nevertheless not\nargumentative. Instead, they are explanations. Consider this passage:\nBecause female authors of her time were often stereotyped as writing light-hearted romances,\nand because her real name was well-known for other (sometimes scandalous) reasons, Mary\nAnn Evans was reluctant to use her own name for her novels. She wanted her work to be taken\nseriously and judged on its own merits. Therefore, she adopted the pen name \u2018George Eliot\u2019.\nThis passage has the words \u2018because\u2019 (twice), and \u2018therefore\u2019, which typically indicate the presence of\npremises and a conclusion, respectively. But it is not an argument. It\u2019s not an argument because it does\nnot have the rhetorical purpose of an argument: the aim of the passage is not to convince you of\nsomething. If it were an argument, the conclusion would be the claim following \u2018therefore\u2019, namely, the\nproposition that Mary Ann Evans adopted the pen name \u2018George Eliot\u2019. But this claim is not the\nconclusion of an argument; the passage is not trying to persuade us to believe that Evans adopted a pen\nname. That she did so is not a controversial claim. Rather, that\u2019s a fact that\u2019s assumed to be known\nalready. The aim of the passage is to explain to us why Evans made that choice. The rhetorical purpose\nis not to convince; it is to inform, to edify. The passage is an explanation, not an argument.\nSo, to determine whether a given passage is an argument or an explanation, we need to figure out its\nrhetorical purpose. Why is the author saying these things to me? Is she trying to convince me of\nsomething, or is she merely trying to inform me\u2014to give me an explanation for something I already\nknew? Sometimes this is easy, as with the George Eliot passage; it\u2019s hard to imagine someone saying\nthose things with persuasive intent. Other times, however, it\u2019s not so easy. Consider the following:\nMany of the celebratory rituals [of Christmas], as well as the timing of the holiday, have their\norigins outside of, and may predate, the Christian commemoration of the birth of Jesus. Those\ntraditions, at their best, have much to do with celebrating human relationships and the\nenjoyment that this life has to offer. As an atheist, I have no hesitation in embracing the holiday\nand joining with believers and nonbelievers alike to celebrate what we have in common.3\nUnless we understand a little bit more about the context of this passage, it\u2019s difficult to determine the\nspeaker\u2019s intentions. It may appear to be an argument. That atheists should embrace a religious holiday\nlike Christmas is, among many, a controversial claim. Controversial claims are the kinds of claims that\nwe often try to convince skeptical people to believe. If the speaker\u2019s audience for this passage is a\nbunch of hard-line atheists, who vehemently reject anything with a whiff of religiosity, who consider\nChristmas a humbug, then it\u2019s pretty clear that the speaker is trying to offer reasons for them to\nreconsider their stance; he\u2019s trying to convince them to embrace Christmas; he\u2019s making an argument. If\nwe explicated the argument, we would paraphrase the last sentence to represent the controversial\n3 John Teehan, 12/24/2006, \u201cA Holiday Season for Atheists, Too,\u201d The New York Times. Excerpted in Copi and Cohen, 2009,\nIntroduction to Logic 13e, p. 25.\n3 Recognizing Arguments 26 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nconclusion: \u2018Atheists should have no hesitation embracing and celebrating Christmas\u2019.\nBut in a different context, with a different audience, this may not be an argument. If we leave the claim\nin the final sentence as-is\u2014\u2018As an atheist, I have no hesitation in embracing the holiday and joining\nwith believers and nonbelievers alike to celebrate what we have in common\u2019\u2014we have a claim about\nthe speaker\u2019s personal beliefs and inclinations. Typically, as we saw above, such claims are not suitable\nas the conclusions of arguments; we don\u2019t usually spend time trying to convince people that we believe\nsuch-and-such. But what is more typical is providing people with explanations for why we believe\nthings. If the author of our passage is an atheist, and he\u2019s saying these things to friends of his, say, who\nknow he\u2019s an atheist, we might have just such an explanation. His friends know he\u2019s not religious, but\nthey know he loves Christmas. That\u2019s kind of weird. Don\u2019t atheists hate religious holidays? Not so, says\nour speaker. Let me explain to you why I have no problems with Christmas, despite my atheism.\nAgain, the difference between arguments and explanations comes down to rhetorical purpose:\narguments try to convince people; explanations try to inform them. Determining whether a given\npassage is one or the other involves figuring out the author\u2019s intentions. To do this, we must carefully\nconsider the context of the passage.\nEXERCISES\n1.

One of the reasons we need different logics is that there are different kinds of\narguments. In this section, we distinguish two types: deductive and inductive arguments.\nDeductive Arguments\nFirst, deductive arguments. These are distinguished by their aim: a deductive argument attempts to\nprovide premises that guarantee, necessitate its conclusion. Success for a deductive argument, then,\ndoes not come in degrees: either the premises do in fact guarantee the conclusion, in which case the\nargument is a good, successful one, or they don\u2019t, in which case it fails. Evaluation of deductive\narguments is a black-and-white, yes-or-no affair; there is no middle ground.\nWe have a special term for a successful deductive argument: we call it valid.

Each of these three\ndefinitions is equivalent to the others; they are just three different ways of saying the same thing:\nAn argument is valid just in case\u2026\n(i) its premises guarantee its conclusion; i.e.,\n(ii) IF its premises are true, then its conclusion must also be true; i.e.,\n(iii) it is impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false.\nHere\u2019s an example of a valid deductive argument:\nAll humans are mortal.\nSocrates is a human.\n/\u2234 Socrates is mortal.\nThis argument is valid because the premises do in fact guarantee the conclusion: if they\u2019re true (as a\nmatter of fact, they are), then the conclusion must be true; it\u2019s impossible for the premises to be true and\nthe conclusion false.\nHere\u2019s a surprising fact about validity: what makes a deductive argument valid has nothing to do with\nits content; rather, validity is determined by the argument\u2019s form. That is to say, what makes our\nSocrates argument valid is not that it says a bunch of accurate things about Socrates, humanity, and\nmortality. The content doesn\u2019t make a difference. Instead, it\u2019s the form that matters\u2014the pattern that the\nargument exhibits.\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n4 Deduction Vs. Induction 30 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nLater, when undertake a more detailed study of deductive logic, we will give a precise definition of\nlogical form.2 For now, we\u2019ll use this rough gloss: the form of an argument is what\u2019s left over when you\nstrip away all the non-logical terms and replace them with blanks.3\nHere\u2019s what that looks like for our Socrates argument:\nAll A are B.\nx is A.\n/\u2234 x is B.\nThe letter are the blanks: they\u2019re placeholders, variables. As a matter of convention, we\u2019re using capital\nletters to stand for groups of things (humans, mortals) and lower case letters to stand for individual\nthings (Socrates).\nThe Socrates argument is a good, valid argument because it exhibits this good, valid form. Our third\nway of wording the definition of validity helps us see why this is a valid form: it\u2019s impossible for the\npremises to be true and the conclusion false, in that it\u2019s impossible to plug in terms for A, B, and x in\nsuch a way that the premises come out true and the conclusion comes out false.\nA consequence of the fact that validity is determined entirely by an argument\u2019s form is that, given a\nvalid form, every single argument that has that form will be valid. So any argument that has the same\nform as our Socrates argument will be valid; that is, we can pick things at random to stick in for A, B,\nand x, and we\u2019re guaranteed to get a valid argument. Here\u2019s a silly example:\nAll apples are bananas.\nDonald Trump is an apple.\n/\u2234 Donald Trump is a banana.\nThis argument has the same form as the Socrates argument: we simply replaced A with \u2018apples\u2019, B with\n\u2018bananas\u2019, and x with \u2018Donald Trump\u2019. That means it\u2019s a valid argument. That\u2019s a strange thing to say,\nsince the argument is just silly\u2014but it\u2019s the form that matters, not the content. Our second way of\nwording the definition of validity can help us here. The standard for validity is this: IF the premises are\ntrue, then the conclusion must be. That\u2019s a big \u2018IF\u2019. In this case, as a matter of fact, the premises are not\ntrue (they\u2019re silly, plainly false). However, IF they were true\u2014if in fact apples were a type of banana\nand Donald Trump were an apple\u2014then the conclusion would be unavoidable: Trump would have to be\na banana. The premises aren\u2019t true, but if they were, the conclusion would have to be\u2014that\u2019s validity.\nSo it turns out that the actual truth or falsehood of the propositions in a valid argument are completely\nirrelevant to its validity. The Socrates argument has all true propositions and it\u2019s valid; the Donald\n2 Definitions, actually. We\u2019ll study two different deductive logics, each with its own definition of form.\n3 What counts as a \u201clogical term,\u201d you\u2019re wondering? Unhelpful answer: it depends on the logic; different logics count\ndifferent terms as logical. Again, this is just a rough gloss. We don\u2019t need precision just yet, but we\u2019ll get it eventually.\n4 Deduction Vs. Induction 31 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nTrump argument has all false propositions, but it\u2019s valid, too. They\u2019re both valid because they have a\nvalid form; the truth/falsity of their propositions don\u2019t make any difference. This means that a valid\nargument can have propositions with almost any combination of truthvalues: some true premises, some\nfalse ones, a true or false conclusion. One can fiddle around with the Socrates\u2019 argument\u2019s form,\nplugging different things in for A, B, and x, and see that this is so. For example, plug in \u2018ants\u2019 for A,\n\u2018bugs\u2019 for B, and Beyonc\u00e9 for x: you get one true premise (All ants are bugs), one false one (Beyonc\u00e9 is\nan ant), and a false conclusion (Beyonc\u00e9 is a bug). Plug in other things and you can get any other\ncombination of truth-values.\nAny combination, that is, but one: you\u2019ll never get true premises and a false conclusion. That\u2019s because\nthe Socrates\u2019 argument\u2019s form is a valid one; by definition, it\u2019s impossible to generate true premises and\na false conclusion in that case.\nThis irrelevance of truth-value to judgments about validity means that those judgments are immune to\nrevision. That is, once we decide whether an argument is valid or not, that decision cannot be changed\nby the discovery of new information. New information might change our judgment about whether a\nparticular proposition in our argument is true or false, but that can\u2019t change our judgment about validity.\nValidity is determined by the argument\u2019s form, and new information can\u2019t change the form of an\nargument. The Socrates argument is valid because it has a valid form. Suppose we discovered, say, that\nas a matter of fact Socrates wasn\u2019t a human being at all, but rather an alien from outer space who got a\nkick out of harassing random people on the streets of ancient Athens. That information would change\nthe argument\u2019s second premise\u2014Socrates is human\u2014from a truth to a falsehood. But it wouldn\u2019t make\nthe argument invalid. The form is still the same, and it\u2019s a valid one.\nIt\u2019s time to face up to an awkward consequence of our definition of validity. Remember, logic is about\nevaluating arguments\u2014saying whether they\u2019re good or bad. We\u2019ve said that for deductive arguments,\nthe standard for goodness is validity: the good deductive arguments are the valid ones. Here\u2019s where the\nawkwardness comes in: because validity is determined by form, it\u2019s possible to generate valid\narguments that are nevertheless completely ridiculous-sounding on their face. Remember, the Donald\nTrump argument\u2014where we concluded that he\u2019s a banana\u2014is valid. In other words, we\u2019re saying that\nthe Trump argument is good; it\u2019s valid, so it gets the logical thumbsup. But that\u2019s nuts! The Trump\nargument is obviously bad, in some sense of \u2018bad\u2019, right? It\u2019s a collection of silly, nonsensical claims.\nWe need a new concept to specify what\u2019s wrong with the Trump argument. That concept is soundness.\nThis is a higher standard of argument-goodness than validity; in order to meet it, an argument must\nsatisfy two conditions.\nAn argument is sound just in case (i) it\u2019s valid, AND (ii) its premises are in fact true.4\nThe Trump argument, while valid, is not sound, because it fails to satisfy the second condition: its\npremises are both false. The Socrates argument, however, which is valid and contains nothing but truths\n4 What about the conclusion? Does it have to be true? Yes: remember, for valid arguments, if the premises are true, the\nconclusion has to be. Sound arguments are valid, so it goes without saying that the conclusion is true, provided that the\npremises are.\n4 Deduction Vs. Induction 32 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n(Socrates was not in fact an alien), is sound.\nThe question now naturally arises: if soundness is a higher standard of argument-goodness than validity,\nwhy didn\u2019t we say that in the first place? Why so much emphasis on validity? The answer is this: we\u2019re\ndoing logic here, and as logicians, we have no special insight into the soundness of arguments. Or\nrather, we should say that as logicians, we have only partial expertise on the question of soundness.\nLogic can tell us whether or not an argument is valid, but it cannot tell us whether or not it is sound.\nLogic has no special insight into the second condition for soundness, the actual truth-values of premises.\nTo take an example from the silly Trump argument, suppose you weren\u2019t sure about the truth of the first\npremise, which claims that all apples are bananas (you have very little experience with fruit,\napparently). How would you go about determining whether that claim was true or false? Whom would\nyou ask? Well, this is a pretty easy one, so you could ask pretty much anybody, but the point is this: if\nyou weren\u2019t sure about the relationship between apples and bananas, you wouldn\u2019t think to yourself, \u201cI\nbetter go find a logician to help me figure this out.\u201d Propositions make claims about how things are in\nthe world. To figure out whether they\u2019re true or false, you need to consult experts in the relevant\nsubject-matter. Most claims aren\u2019t about logic, so logic is very little help in determining truth-values.\nSince logic can only provide insight into the validity half of the soundness question, we focus on\nvalidity and leave soundness to one side.\nReturning to validity, then, we\u2019re now in a position to do some actual logic. Given what we know, we\ncan demonstrate invalidity; that is, we can prove that an invalid argument is invalid, and therefore bad\n(it can\u2019t be sound, either; the first condition for soundness is validity, so if the argument\u2019s invalid, the\nquestion of actual truth-values doesn\u2019t even come up). Here\u2019s how:\nTo demonstrate the invalidity of an argument, one must write a down a new argument with the\nsame form as the original, whose premises are in fact true and whose conclusion is in fact false.\nThis new argument is called a counterexample.\nLet\u2019s look at an example. The following argument is invalid:\nSome mammals are swimmers.\nAll whales are swimmers.\n/\u2234 All whales are mammals.\nNow, it\u2019s not really obvious that the argument is invalid. It does have one thing going for it: all the\nclaims it makes are true. But we know that doesn\u2019t make any difference, since validity is determined by\nthe argument\u2019s form, not its content. If this argument is invalid, it\u2019s invalid because it has a bad, invalid\nform. This is the form:\nSome A are B.\nAll C are B.\n/\u2234 All C are A.\nTo prove that the original whale argument is invalid, we have to show that this form is invalid. For a\nvalid form, we learned, it\u2019s impossible to plug things into the blanks and get true premises and a false\n4 Deduction Vs. Induction 33 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nconclusion; so for an invalid form, it\u2019s possible to plug things into the blanks and get that result. That\u2019s\nhow we generate our counterexample: we plug things in for A, B, and C so that the premises turn out\ntrue and the conclusion turns out false. There\u2019s no real method here; you just use your imagination to\ncome up with an A, B, and C that give the desired result.5 Here\u2019s a counterexample:\nSome lawyers are American citizens.\nAll members of Congress are American citizens.\n/\u2234 All members of Congress are lawyers.\nFor A, we inserted \u2018lawyers\u2019, for B we chose \u2018American citizens\u2019, and for C, \u2018members of Congress\u2019.\nThe first premise is clearly true. The second premise is true: non-citizens aren\u2019t eligible to be in\nCongress. And the conclusion is false: there are lots of people in Congress who are nonlawyers\u2014\ndoctors, businesspeople, etc.\nThat\u2019s all we need to do to prove that the original whale-argument is invalid: come up with one\ncounterexample, one way of filling in the blanks in its form to get true premises and a false conclusion.\nWe only have to prove that it\u2019s possible to get true premises and a false conclusion, and for that, you\nonly need one example.\nWhat\u2019s far more difficult is to prove that a particular argument is valid. To do that, we\u2019d have to show\nthat its form is such that it\u2019s impossible to generate a counterexample, to fill in the blanks to get true\npremises and a false conclusion. Proving that it\u2019s possible is easy; you only need one counterexample.\nProving that it\u2019s impossible is hard; in fact, at first glance, it looks impossibly hard! What do you do?\nCheck all the possible ways of plugging things into the blanks, and make sure that none of them turn out\nto have true premises and a false conclusion? That\u2019s nuts! There are, literally, infinitely many ways to\nfill in the blanks in an argument\u2019s form. Nobody has the time to check infinitely many potential\ncounterexamples.\nWell, take heart; it\u2019s still early. For now, we\u2019re able to do a little bit of deductive logic: given an invalid\nargument, we can demonstrate that it is in fact invalid. We\u2019re not yet in the position we\u2019d like to be in,\nnamely of being able to determine, for any argument whatsoever, whether it\u2019s valid or not. Proving\nvalidity looks too hard based on what we know so far. But we\u2019ll know more later: in chapters 3 and 4\nwe will study two deductive logics, and each one will give us a method of deciding whether or not any\ngiven argument is valid. But that\u2019ll have to wait. Baby steps.\nInductive Arguments\nThat\u2019s all we\u2019ll say for now about deductive arguments. On to the other type of argument we\u2019re\nintroducing in this section: inductive arguments. These are distinguished from their deductive cousins\nby their relative lack of ambition. Whereas deductive arguments aim to give premises that\n5 Possibly helpful hint: universal generalizations (All ___ are ____) are rarely true, so if you have to make one true, as in this\nexample, it might be good to start there; likewise, particular claims (Some ___ are ___) are rarely false, so if you have to\nmake one false\u2014you don\u2019t in this particular example, but if you had one as a conclusion, you would\u2014 that would be a good\nplace to start.\n4 Deduction Vs. Induction 34 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nguarantee/necessitate the conclusion, inductive arguments are more modest: they aim merely to provide\npremises that make the conclusion more probable than it otherwise would be; they aim to support the\nconclusion, but without making it unavoidable.\nHere is an example of an inductive argument:\nI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not going die taking a plane to visit us. Airplane crashes happen far less\nfrequently than car crashes, for example; so you\u2019re taking a bigger risk if you drive. In fact,\nplane crashes are so rare, you\u2019re far more likely to die from slipping in the bathtub. You\u2019re not\ngoing to stop taking showers, are you?\nThe speaker is trying to convince her visitor that he won\u2019t die in a plane crash on the way to visit her.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion: you won\u2019t die. This claim is supported by the others\u2014which emphasize how rare\nplane crashes are\u2014but it is not guaranteed by them. After all, plane crashes sometimes do happen.\nInstead, the premises give reasons to believe that the conclusion\u2014you won\u2019t die\u2014is very probable.\nSince inductive arguments have a different, more modest goal than their deductive cousins, it would be\nunreasonable for us to apply the same evaluative standards to both kinds of argument. That is, we can\u2019t\nuse the terms \u2018valid\u2019 and \u2018invalid\u2019 to apply to inductive arguments. Remember, for an argument to be\nvalid, its premises must guarantee its conclusion. But inductive arguments don\u2019t even try to provide a\nguarantee of the conclusion; technically, then, they\u2019re all invalid. But that won\u2019t do. We need a different\nevaluative vocabulary to apply to inductive arguments. We will say of inductive arguments that they are\n(relatively) strong or weak, depending on how probable their conclusions are in light of their premises.\nOne inductive argument is stronger than another when its conclusion is more probable than the other,\ngiven their respective premises.\nOne consequence of this difference in evaluative standards for inductive and deductive arguments is that\nfor the former, unlike the latter, our evaluations are subject to revision in light of new evidence. Recall\nthat since the validity or invalidity of a deductive argument is determined entirely by its form, as\nopposed to its content, the discovery of new information could not affect our evaluation of those\narguments. The Socrates argument remained valid, even if we discovered that Socrates was in fact an\nalien. Our evaluations of inductive arguments, though, are not immune to revision in this way. New\ninformation might make the conclusion of an inductive argument more or less probable, and so we\nwould have to revise our judgment accordingly, saying that the argument is stronger or weaker.\nReturning to the example above about plane crashes, suppose we were to discover that the FBI in the\nvisitor\u2019s hometown had recently being hearing lots of \u201cchatter\u201d from terrorist groups active in the area,\nwith strong indications that they were planning to blow up a passenger plane. Yikes! This would affect\nour estimation of the probability of the conclusion of the argument\u2014that the visitor wasn\u2019t going to die\nin a crash. The probability of not dying goes down (as the probability of dying goes up). This new\ninformation would trigger a re-evaluation of the argument, and we would say it\u2019s now weaker. If, on the\nother hand, we were to learn that the airline that flies between the visitor\u2019s and the speaker\u2019s towns had\nrecently upgraded its entire fleet, getting rid of all of its older planes, replacing them with newer, more\nreliable model, while in addition instituting a new, more thorough and rigorous program of pre- and\npost-flight safety and maintenance inspections\u2014well, then we might revise our judgment in the other\ndirection. Given this information, we might judge that things are even safer for the visitor as it regards\n4 Deduction Vs. Induction 35 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nplane travel; that is, the proposition that the visitor won\u2019t die is now even more probable than it was\nbefore. This new information would strengthen the argument to that conclusion.\nReasonable follow-up question: how much is the argument strengthened or weakened by the new\ninformation imagined in these scenarios? Answer: how should I know? Sorry, that\u2019s not very helpful.\nBut here\u2019s the point: we\u2019re talking about probabilities here; sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what the\nprobability of something happening really is. Sometimes it\u2019s not: if I flip a coin, I know that the\nprobability of it coming up tails is 0.5. But how probable is it that a particular plane from Airline X will\ncrash with our hypothetical visitor on board? I don\u2019t know. And how much more probable is a disaster\non the assumption of increased terrorist chatter? Again, I have no idea. All I know is that the probability\nof dying on the plane goes up in that case. And in the scenario in which Airline X has lots of new planes\nand security measures, the probability of a crash goes down. Sometimes, with inductive arguments, all\nwe can do is make relative judgments about strength and weakness: in light of these new facts, the\nconclusion is more or less probable than it was before we learned of the new facts. Sometimes,\nhowever, we can be precise about probabilities and make absolute judgments about strength and\nweakness: we can say precisely how probable a conclusion is in light of the premises supporting it. But\nthis is a more advanced topic. We will discuss inductive logic in chapters 5 and 6, and will go into more\ndepth then. Until then, patience. Baby steps.\nEXERCISES\n1.

Induction 37 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n5\nDiagramming Arguments1\nBefore we get down to the business of evaluating arguments\u2014of judging them valid or invalid, strong\nor weak\u2014we still need to do some preliminary work. We need to develop our analytical skills to gain a\ndeeper understanding of how arguments are constructed, how they hang together. So far, we\u2019ve said that\nthe premises are there to support the conclusion. But we\u2019ve done very little in the way of analyzing the\nstructure of arguments: we\u2019ve just separated the premises from the conclusion. We know that the\npremises are supposed to support the conclusion. What we haven\u2019t explored is the question of just how\nthe premises in a given argument do that job\u2014how they work together to support the conclusion, what\nkinds of relationships they have with one another. This is a deeper level of analysis than merely\ndistinguishing the premises from the conclusion; it will require a mode of presentation more elaborate\nthan a list of propositions with the bottom one separated from the others by a horizontal line. To display\nour understanding of the relationships among premises supporting the conclusion, we are going to\ndepict them: we are going to draw diagrams of arguments.\nHere\u2019s how the diagrams will work. They will consist of three elements: (1) circles with numbers inside\nthem\u2014each of the propositions in the argument we\u2019re diagramming will be assigned a number, so these\ncircled numbers in the diagram will represent the propositions; (2) arrows pointed at circled numbers\u2014\nthese will represent relationships of support, where one or more propositions provide a reason for\nbelieving the one pointed to; and (3) horizontal brackets\u2014propositions connected by these will be\ninterdependent (in a sense to be specified below).\nOur diagrams will always feature the circled number corresponding to the conclusion at the bottom. The\npremises will be above, with brackets and arrows indicating how they collectively support the\nconclusion and how they\u2019re related to one another. There are a number of different relationships that\npremises can have to one another. We will learn how to draw diagrams of arguments by considering\nthem in turn.\nIndependent Premises\nOften, different premises will support a conclusion\u2014or another premise\u2014individually, without help\nfrom any others. When this is the case, we draw an arrow from the circled number representing that\npremise to the circled number representing the proposition it supports.\nConsider this simple argument:\n\u2460 Marijuana is less addictive than alcohol. In addition, \u2461 it can be used as a medicine to treat\na variety of conditions. Therefore, \u2462 marijuana should be legal.\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n5 Diagramming Arguments 38 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nThe last proposition is clearly the conclusion (the word \u2018therefore\u2019 is a big clue), and the first two\npropositions are the premises supporting it. They support the conclusion independently. The mark of\nindependence is this: each of the premises would still provide support for the conclusion even if the\nother weren\u2019t true; each, on its own, gives you a reason for believing the conclusion. In this case, then,\nwe diagram the argument as follows:\n\u2460 \u2461\n\\ /\n\u2462\nIntermediate Premises\nSome premises support their conclusions more directly than others. Premises provide more indirect\nsupport for a conclusion by providing a reason to believe another premise that supports the conclusion\nmore directly. That is, some premises are intermediate between the conclusion and other premises.\nConsider this simple argument:\n\u2460 Automatic weapons should be illegal. \u2461 They can be used to kill large numbers of people in\na short amount of time. This is because \u2462 all you have to do is hold down the trigger and\nbullets come flying out in rapid succession.\nThe conclusion of this argument is the first proposition, so the premises are propositions 2 and 3.\nNotice, though, that there\u2019s a relationship between those two claims. The third sentence starts with the\nphrase \u2018This is because\u2019, indicating that it provides a reason for another claim. The other claim is\nproposition 2; \u2018This\u2019 refers to the claim that automatic weapons can kill large numbers of people\nquickly. Why should I believe that they can do that? Because all one has to do is hold down the trigger\nto release lots of bullets really fast. Proposition 2 provides immediate support for the conclusion\n(automatic weapons can kill lots of people really quickly, so we should make them illegal); proposition\n3 supports the conclusion more indirectly, by giving support to proposition 2. Here is how we diagram\nin this case:\n\u2462\n\u2193\n\u2461\n\u2193\n\u2460\nJoint Premises\nSometimes premises need each other: the job of supporting another proposition can\u2019t be done by each\n5 Diagramming Arguments 39 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\non its own; they can only provide support together, jointly. Far from being independent, such premises\nare interdependent. In this situation, on our diagrams, we join together the interdependent premises with\na bracket underneath their circled numbers.\nThere are a number of different ways in which premises can provide joint support. Sometimes, premises\njust fit together like a hand in a glove; or, switching metaphors, one premise is like the key that fits into\nthe other to unlock the proposition they jointly support. An example can make this clear:\n\u2460 The chef has decided that either salmon or chicken will be tonight\u2019s special. \u2461 Salmon\nwon\u2019t be the special. Therefore, \u2462 the special will be chicken.\nNeither premise 1 nor premise 2 can support the conclusion on its own. A useful rule of thumb for\nchecking whether one proposition can support another is this: read the first proposition, then say the\nword \u2018therefore\u2019, then read the second proposition; if it doesn\u2019t make any sense, then you can\u2019t draw an\narrow from the one to the other. Let\u2019s try it here: \u201cThe chef has decided that either salmon or chicken\nwill be tonight\u2019s special; therefore, the special will be chicken.\u201d That doesn\u2019t make any sense. What\nhappened to salmon? Proposition 1 can\u2019t support the conclusion on its own. Neither can the second:\n\u201cSalmon won\u2019t be the special; therefore, the special will be chicken.\u201d Again, that makes no sense. Why\nchicken? What about steak, or lobster? The second proposition can\u2019t support the conclusion on its own,\neither; it needs help from the first proposition, which tells us that if it\u2019s not salmon, it\u2019s chicken.\nPropositions 1 and 2 need each other; they support the conclusion jointly. This is how we diagram the\nargument:\n\u2460 \u2461\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2462\nThe same diagram would depict the following argument:\n\u2460 John Le Carre gives us realistic, three-dimensional characters and complex, interesting plots.\n\u2461 Ian Fleming, on the other hand, presents an unrealistically glamorous picture of international\nespionage, and his plotting isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call immersive. \u2462 Le Carre is a better author of\nspy novels than Fleming.\nIn this example, the premises work jointly in a different way than in the previous example. Rather than\nfitting together hand-in-glove, these premises each give us half of what we need to arrive at the\nconclusion. The conclusion is a comparison between two authors. Each of the premises makes claims\nabout one of the two authors. Neither one, on its own, can support the comparison, because the\ncomparison is a claim about both of them. The premises can only support the conclusion together. We\n5 Diagramming Arguments 40 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nwould diagram this argument the same way as the last one.\nAnother common pattern for joint premises is when general propositions need help to provide support\nfor particular propositions. Consider the following argument:\n\u2460 People shouldn\u2019t vote for racist, incompetent candidates for president. \u2461 Donald Trump\nseems to make a new racist remark at least twice a week. And \u2462 he lacks the competence to\nrun even his own (failed) businesses, let alone the whole country. \u2463 You shouldn\u2019t vote for\nTrump to be the president.\nThe conclusion of the argument, the thing it\u2019s trying to convince us of, is the last proposition\u2014 you\nshouldn\u2019t vote for Trump. This is a particular claim: it\u2019s a claim about an individual person, Trump. The\nfirst proposition in the argument, on the other hand, is a general claim: it asserts that, generally\nspeaking, people shouldn\u2019t vote for incompetent racists; it makes no mention of an individual candidate.\nIt cannot, therefore, support the particular conclusion\u2014about Trump\u2014on its own. It needs help from\nother particular claims\u2014propositions 2 and 3\u2014that tell us that the individual in the conclusion, Trump,\nmeets the conditions laid out in the general proposition 1: racism and incompetence. This is how we\ndiagram the argument:\n\u2460 \u2461 \u2462\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2463\nOccasionally, an argumentative passage will only explicitly state one of a set of joint premises because\nthe others \u201cgo without saying\u201d\u2014they are part of the body of background information about which both\nspeaker and audience agree. In the last example, that Trump was an incompetent racist was not\nuncontroversial background information. But consider this argument:\n\u2460 It would be good for the country to have a woman with lots of experience in public office as\npresident. \u2461 People should vote for Hillary Clinton.\nDiagramming this argument seems straightforward: an arrow pointing from \u2460 to \u2461. But we\u2019ve got the\nsame relationship between the premise and conclusion as in the last example: the premise is a general\nclaim, mentioning no individual at all, while the conclusion is a particular claim about Hillary Clinton.\nDoesn\u2019t the general premise \u201cneed help\u201d from particular claims to the effect that the individual in\nquestion, Hillary Clinton, meets the conditions set forth in the premise\u2014i.e., that she\u2019s a woman and\nthat she has lots of experience in public office? No, not really. Everybody knows those things about her\nalready; they go without saying, and can therefore be left unstated (implicit, tacit).\n5 Diagramming Arguments 41 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nBut suppose we had included those obvious truths about Clinton in our presentation of the argument;\nsuppose we had made the tacit premises explicit:\n\u2460 It would be good for the country to have a woman with lots of experience in public office as\npresident. \u2461 Hillary Clinton is a woman. And \u2462 she has deep experience with public\noffices\u2014as a First Lady, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State. \u2463 People should vote for Hillary\nClinton.\nHow do we diagram this? Earlier, we talked about a rule of thumb for determining whether or not it\u2019s a\ngood idea to draw an arrow from one number to another in a diagram: read the sentence corresponding\nto the first number, say the word \u2018therefore\u2019, then read the sentence corresponding to the second\nnumber; if it doesn\u2019t make sense, then the arrow is a bad idea. But if it does make sense, does that mean\nyou should draw the arrow? Not necessarily. Consider the first and last sentences in this passage. Read\nthe first, then \u2018therefore\u2019, then the last. Makes pretty good sense! That\u2019s just the original formulation of\nthe argument with the tacit propositions remaining implicit. And in that case we said it would be OK to\ndraw an arrow from the general premise\u2019s number straight to the conclusion\u2019s. But when we add the\ntacit premises\u2014the second and third sentences in this passage\u2014we can\u2019t draw an arrow directly from\n\u2460 to \u2463. To do so would obscure the relationship among the first three propositions and misrepresent\nhow the argument works. If we drew an arrow from \u2460 to \u2463, what would we do with \u2461 to \u2462 in our\ndiagram? Do they get their own arrows, too? No, that won\u2019t do. Such a diagram would be telling us that\nthe first three propositions each independently provide a reason for the conclusion. But they\u2019re clearly\nnot independent; there\u2019s a relationship among them that our diagram must capture, and it\u2019s the same\nrelationship we saw in the parallel argument about Trump, with the particular claims in the second and\nthird propositions working together with the general claim in the first:\n\u2460 \u2461 \u2462\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2463\nThe arguments we\u2019ve looked at thus far have been quite short\u2014only two or three premises. But of\ncourse some arguments are longer than that. Some are much longer. It may prove instructive, at this\npoint, to tackle one of these longer bits of reasoning. It comes from the (fictional) master of analytical\ndeductive reasoning, Sherlock Holmes. The following passage is from the first Holmes story\u2014A Study\nin Scarlet, one of the few novels Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about his most famous character\u2014and it\u2019s\na bit of early dialogue that takes place shortly after Holmes and his longtime associate Dr. Watson meet\nfor the first time. At that first meeting, Holmes did his typical Holmesy thing, where he takes a quick\nglance at a person and then immediately makes some startling inference about them, stating some fact\nabout them that it seems impossible he could have known. Here they are\u2014Holmes and Watson\u2014\ntalking about it a day or two later. Holmes is the first to speak:\n5 Diagramming Arguments 42 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n\u201cObservation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our\nfirst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\u201d\n\u201cYou were told, no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cNothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts\nran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of\nintermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, \u2018Here is a\ngentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He\nhas just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His\nleft arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could\nan English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\nAfghanistan.\u2019 The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\ncame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\u201d2\nThis is an extended inference, with lots of propositions leading to the conclusion that Watson had been\nin Afghanistan. Before we draw the diagram, let\u2019s number the propositions involved in the argument:\n1. Watson was in Afghanistan.\n2. Watson is a medical man. 3. Watson is a military man.\n4. Watson is an army doctor.\n5. Watson has just come from the tropics.\n6. Watson\u2019s face is dark.\n7. Watson\u2019s skin is not naturally dark.\n8. Watson\u2019s wrists are fair.\n9. Watson has undergone hardship and sickness.\n10. Watson\u2019s face is haggard.\n11. Watson\u2019s arm has been injured.\n12. Watson holds his arm stiffly and unnaturally.\n13. Only in Afghanistan could an English army doctor have been in the tropics, seen much\nhardship and got his arm wounded.\nLots of propositions, but they\u2019re mostly straightforward, right from the text. We just had to do a bit of\nparaphrasing on the last one\u2014Holmes asks a rhetorical question and answers it, the upshot of which is\nthe general proposition in 13. We know that proposition 1 is our conclusion, so that goes at the bottom\nof the diagram. The best thing to do is to start there and work our way up. Our next question is: Which\npremise or premises support that conclusion most directly? What goes on the next level up on our\ndiagram?\nIt seems fairly clear that proposition 13 belongs on that level. The question is whether it is alone there,\nwith an arrow from 13 to 1, or whether it needs some help. The answer is that it needs help. This is the\ngeneral/particular pattern we identified above. The conclusion is about a particular individual\u2014Watson.\nProposition 13 is entirely general (presumably Holmes knows this because he reads the paper and\n2 Also excerpted in Copi and Cohen, 2009, Introduction to Logic 13e, pp. 58 - 59.\n5 Diagramming Arguments 43 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nknows the disposition of Her Majesty\u2019s troops throughout the Empire); it does not mention Watson. So\nproposition 13 needs help from other propositions that give us the relevant particulars about the\nindividual, Watson. A number of conditions are laid out that a person must meet in order for us to\nconclude that they\u2019ve been in Afghanistan: army doctor, being in the tropics, undergoing hardship,\ngetting wounded. That Watson satisfies these conditions is asserted by, respectively, propositions 4, 5,\n9, and 11. Those are the propositions that must work jointly with the general proposition 13 to give us\nour particular conclusion about Watson:\n\u2463 \u2464 \u246c \u2468 \u246a\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2460\nNext, we must figure out how what happens at the next level up. How are propositions 4, 5, 13, 9, and\n11 justified? As we noted, the justification for 13 happens off-screen, as it were. Holmes is able to make\nthat generalization because he follows the news and knows, presumably, that the only place in the\nBritish Empire where army troops are actively fighting in tropics is Afghanistan. The justification for\nthe other propositions, however, is right there in the text.\nLet\u2019s take them one at a time. First, proposition 4: Watson is an army doctor. How does Holmes support\nthis claim? With propositions 2 and 3, which tell us that Watson is a medical and a military man,\nrespectively. This is another pattern we\u2019ve identified: these two proposition jointly support 4, because\nthey each provide half of what we need to get there. There are two parts to the claim in 4: army and\ndoctor. 2 gives us the doctor part; 3 gives us the army part. 2 and 3 jointly support 4.\nSkipping 5 (it\u2019s a bit more involved), let\u2019s turn to 9 and 11, which are easily dispatched. What\u2019s the\nreason for believing 9, that Watson has suffered hardship? Go back to the passage. It\u2019s his haggard face\nthat testifies to his suffering. Proposition 10 supports 9. Now 11: what evidence do we have that\nWatson\u2019s arm has been injured? Proposition 12: he holds it stiffly and unnaturally. 12 supports 11.\nFinally, proposition 5: Watson was in the tropics. There are three propositions involved in supporting\nthis one: 6, 7, and 8. Proposition 6 tells us Watson\u2019s face is dark; 7 tells us that his skin isn\u2019t naturally\ndark; 8 tells us his wrists are fair (light-colored skin). It\u2019s tempting to think that 6 on its own\u2014dark\nskin\u2014supports the claim that he was in the tropics. But it does not. One can have dark skin and not\nvisited the tropics, provided one\u2019s skin is naturally dark. What tells us Watson has been in the tropics is\nthat he has a tan\u2014that his skin is dark and that\u2019s not its natural tone. 6 and 7 jointly support 5. And how\ndo we know Watson\u2019s skin isn\u2019t naturally dark? By checking his wrists, which are fair: proposition 8\nsupports 7.\n5 Diagramming Arguments 44 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nSo this is our final diagram:\n\u2467\n\u2193\n\u2461 \u2462 \u2465 \u2466\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2469 \u246b\n\u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193\n\u2463 \u2464 \u246c \u2468 \u246a\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2460\nAnd there we go. An apparently unwieldy passage\u2014thirteen propositions!\u2014turns out not to be so bad.\nThe lesson is that we must go step by step: start by identifying the conclusion, then ask which\nproposition(s) most directly support it; from there, work back until all the propositions have been\ndiagrammed. Every long argument is just composed out of smaller, easily analyzed inferences.\nEXERCISES\nDiagram the following arguments.\n1. \u2460 Hillary Clinton would make a better president than Donald Trump. \u2461 Clinton is a toughminded\npragmatist who gets things done. \u2462 Trump is a thin-skinned maniac who will be totally ineffective\nin dealing with Congress.\n2. \u2460 Donald Trump is a jerk who\u2019s always offending people. Furthermore, \u2461 he has no experience\nwhatsoever in government. \u2462 Nobody should vote for him to be president.\n3. \u2460 Human beings evolved to eat meat, so \u2461 eating meat is not immoral. \u2462 It\u2019s never immoral for\na creature to act according to its evolutionary instincts.\n5 Diagramming Arguments 45 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n4. \u2460 We need new campaign finance laws in this country. \u2461 The influence of Wall Street money on\nelections is causing a breakdown in our democracy with bad consequences for social justice. \u2462\nPoliticians who have taken those donations are effectively bought and paid for, consistently favoring\npolicies that benefit the rich at the expense of the vast majority of citizens.\n5. \u2460 Voters shouldn\u2019t trust any politician who took money from Wall Street bankers. \u2461 Hillary\nClinton accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fee from Goldman Sachs, a big Wall\nStreet firm. \u2462 You shouldn\u2019t trust her.\n6. \u2460 There are only three possible explanations for the presence of the gun at the crime scene:\neither the defendant just happened to hide from the police right next to where the gun was found, or the\npolice planted the gun there after the fact, or it was really the defendant\u2019s gun like the prosecution says.\n\u2461 The first option is too crazy a coincidence to be at all believable, and \u2462 we\u2019ve been given no\nevidence at all that the officers on the scene had any means or motivation to plant the weapon.\nTherefore, \u2463 it has to be the defendant\u2019s gun.\n7. \u2460 Golden State has to be considered the clear favorite to win the NBA Championship. \u2461 No team\nhas ever lost in the Finals after taking a 3-games-to-1 lead, and \u2462 Golden State now leads\nCleveland 3-to-1. In addition, \u2463 Golden State has the MVP of the league, Stephen Curry.\n8. \u2460 We should increase funding to public colleges and universities. First of all, \u2461 as funding has\ndecreased, students have had to shoulder a larger share of the financial burden of attending college,\namassing huge amounts of debt. \u2462 A recent report shows that the average college student graduates\nwith almost $30,000 in debt. Second, \u2463 funding public universities is a good investment. \u2464 Every\neconomist agrees that spending on public colleges is a good investment for states, where the\neconomic benefits far outweigh the amount spent.\n9. \u2460 LED lightbulbs last for a really long time and \u2461 they cost very little to keep lit. \u2462 They are,\ntherefore, a great way to save money. \u2463 Old-fashioned incandescent bulbs, on the other hand, are\nwasteful. \u2464 You should buy LEDs instead of incandescent bulbs.\n5 Diagramming Arguments 46 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n10. \u2460 There\u2019s a hole in my left shoe, which means \u2461 my feet will get wet when I wear them in the\nrain, and so \u2462 I\u2019ll probably catch a cold or something if I don\u2019t get a new pair of shoes.\nFurthermore, \u2463 having new shoes would make me look cool. \u2464 I should buy new shoes.\n11. Look, it\u2019s just simple economics: \u2460 if people stop buying a product, then companies will stop\nproducing it. And \u2461 people just aren\u2019t buying tablets as much anymore. \u2462 The CEO of Best Buy\nrecently said that sales of tablets are \u201ccrashing\u201d at his stores. \u2463 Samsung\u2019s sales of tablets were\ndown 14% this year alone. \u2464 Apple\u2019s not going to continue to make your beloved iPad for much\nlonger.\n12. \u2460 We should increase infrastructure spending as soon as possible. Why? First, \u2461 the longer we\ndelay needed repairs to things like roads and bridges, the more they will cost in the future. Second,\n\u2462 it would cause a drop in unemployment, as workers would be hired to do the work. Third, \u2463\nwith interest rates at all-time lows, financing the spending would cost relatively little. A fourth\nreason? \u2464 Economic growth. \u2465 Most economists agree that government spending in the current\nclimate would boost GDP.\n13. \u2460 Smoking causes cancer and \u2461 cigarettes are really expensive. \u2462 You should quit smoking. \u2463\nIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll never get a girlfriend. \u2464 Smoking makes you less attractive to girls: \u2465 it stains\nyour teeth and \u2466 it gives you bad breath.\n14. \u2460 The best cookbooks are comprehensive, well-written, and most importantly, have recipes that\nwork. This is why \u2461 Mark Bittman\u2019s classic How to Cook Everything is among the best cookbooks\never written. As its title indicates, \u2462 Bittman\u2019s book is comprehensive. Of course it doesn\u2019t literally\nteach you how to cook everything, but \u2463 it features recipes for cuisines from around the world\u2014\nfrom French, Italian, and Spanish food to dishes from the Far and Middle East, as well as classic\nAmerican comfort foods. In addition, \u2464 he covers almost every ingredient imaginable, with all\ndifferent kinds of meats\u2014including game\u2014and every fruit and vegetable under the sun. \u2465 The\nbook is also extremely well-written. \u2466 Bittman\u2019s prose is clear, concise, and even witty. Finally,\n5 Diagramming Arguments 47 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n\u2467 Bittman\u2019s recipes simply work. \u2468 In my many years of consulting How to Cook Everything,\nI\u2019ve never had one lead me astray.\n15. \u2460 Logic teachers should make more money than CEOs. \u2461 Logic is more important than business.\n\u2462 Without logic, we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when people were trying to fool us: \u2463 we wouldn\u2019t\nknow a good argument from a bad one. \u2464 But nobody would miss business if it went away. \u2465\nWhat do businesses do except take our money? \u2466 And all those damned commercials they make;\neverybody hates commercials. \u2467 In a well-organized society, members of more important\nprofessions would be paid more, because \u2468 paying people is a great way to encourage them to do\nuseful things. \u2469 People love money.\n5 Diagramming Arguments 48 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n6\nCommon Deductive Arguments Forms1\nThe first common form of inference is \u201cmodus ponens\u201d which is Latin for \u201cway that affirms.\u201d Modus\nponens has the following form:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. p\n3. \u2234 q\nWhat this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 q) and we have\nalso asserted the antecedent of that conditional statement (p), then we are entitled to infer the consequent\nof that conditional statement (q). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining, then the\nground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cit is raining\u201d (the antecedent of that conditional) then I (or anyone\nelse, for that matter) am entitled to assert the consequent of the conditional, \u201cthe ground is wet.\u201d\nThus, any argument that has this same form is valid. For example, the following argument also has this\nsame form (modus ponens):\n1. (A \u22c5 B) \u2283 C\n2. (A \u22c5 B)\n3. \u2234 C\nIn this argument we can assert C according to the rule, modus ponens. This is so even though the\nantecedent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a conjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first\npremise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operator) and the second premise\nis the antecedent of that conditional statement. The rule modus ponens says that if we have that much,\nwe are entitled to infer the consequent of the conditional.\nWe can actually use modus ponens in this argument:\n1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K)\n2. ~K\n3. R v S /\u2234 ~T\n4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3\nWhat I have done here is I have written the valid form of inference (or rule) that justifies the line I am\nderiving, as well as the lines to which that rule applies, to the right of the new line of the proof that I am\nderiving. Here I have derived \u201cT \u2283 K\u201d from lines 1 and 3 of the argument by modus ponens. Notice that\nline 1 is a conditional statement and line 3 is the antecedent of that conditional statement. This proof\n1 Van Cleave, Matthew J. (2016). Logic and Critical Thinking (v1.4).

Printed here under a CC-\nBY license.\n6 Common Deductive Arguments Forms 49 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nisn\u2019t finished yet, since we have not yet derived the conclusion we are trying to derive, namely, \u201c~T.\u201d\nWe need a different rule to derive that, which we will introduce next.\nThe next form of inference is called \u201cmodus tollens,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cthe way that denies.\u201d Modus\ntollens has the following form:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. ~q\n3. \u2234 ~p\nWhat this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 q) and we have\nalso asserted the negated consequent of that conditional (~q), then we are entitled to infer the negated\nantecedent of that conditional statement (~p). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining,\nthen the ground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cthe ground is not wet\u201d (the negated consequent of that\nconditional) then I am entitled to assert the negated antecedent of the conditional, \u201cit is not raining.\u201d It is\nimportant to see that any argument that has this same form is a valid argument. For example, the\nfollowing argument is also an argument with this same form:\n1. C \u2283 (E v F)\n2. ~(E v F)\n3. \u2234 ~C\nIn this argument we can assert ~C according to the rule, modus tollens. This is so even though the\nconsequent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a disjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first\npremise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operator) and the second premise\nis the negated consequent of that conditional statement. The rule modus tollens says that if we have that\nmuch, we are entitled to infer the negated antecedent of the conditional. We can use modus tollens to\ncomplete the proof we started above:\n1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K)\n2. ~K\n3. R v S /\u2234 ~T\n4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3\n5. ~T Modus tollens, lines 2, 4\nNotice that the last line of the proof is the conclusion that we are supposed to derive and that each\nstatement that I have derived (i.e., lines 4 and 5) has a rule to the right. That rule cited is the rule that\njustifies the statement that is being derived and the lines cited are the previous lines of the proof where\nwe can see that the rule applies. This is what is called a proof. A proof is a series of statements, starting\nwith the premises and ending with the conclusion, where each additional statement after the premises is\nderived from some previous line(s) of the proof using one of the valid forms of inference. We will\npractice this some more in the exercise at the end of this section.\nThe next form of inference we will introduce is called \u201cdisjunctive syllogism\u201d and it has the following\nform:\n6 Common Deductive Arguments Forms 50 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n1. p v q\n2. ~p\n3. \u2234 q\nIn words, this rule states that if we have asserted a disjunction and we have asserted the negation of one\nof the disjuncts, then we are entitled to assert the other disjunct. Once you think about it, this inference\nshould be pretty obvious.\nIf we are taking for granted the truth of the premises\u2014that either p or q is true; and that p is not true\u2014\nthen is has to follow that q is true in order for the original disjunction to be true. (Remember that we\nmust assume the premises are true when evaluating whether an argument is valid.) If I assert that it is\ntrue that either Bob or Linda stole the diamond, and I assert that Bob did not steal the diamond, then it\nhas to follow that Linda did. That is a disjunctive syllogism. As before, any argument that has this same\nform is a valid argument. For example,\n1. ~A v (B \u22c5 C)\n2. ~~A\n3. \u2234 B \u22c5 C\nis a valid inference because it has the same form as disjunctive syllogism. The first premise is a\ndisjunction (since the wedge is the main operator), the second premise is simply the negation of the left\ndisjunct, \u201c~A\u201d, and the conclusion is the right disjunct of the original disjunction. It may help you to see\nthe form of the argument if you treat \u201c~A\u201d as the p and \u201cB \u22c5 C\u201d as the q. Also notice that the second\npremise contains a double negation. Your English teacher may tell you never to use double negatives,\nbut as far as logic is concerned, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a double negation. In this case,\nour left disjunct in premise 1 is itself a negation, while premise 2 is simply a negation of that left\ndisjunct.\nThe next form of inference is called \u201chypothetical syllogism.\u201d This is what ancient philosophers called\n\u201cthe chain argument\u201d and it should be obvious why in a moment. Here is the form of the rule:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. q \u2283 r\n3. \u2234 p \u2283 r\nAs you can see, the conclusion of this argument links p and r together in a conditional statement. We\ncould continue adding conditionals such as \u201cr \u2283 s\u201d and \u201cs \u2283 t\u201d and the inferences would be just as valid.\nAnd if we lined them all up as I have below, you can see why ancient philosophers referred to this valid\nargument form as a \u201cchain argument\u201d:\np \u2283 q\nq \u2283 r\nr \u2283 s\ns \u2283 t\n\u2234 p \u2283 t\n6 Common Deductive Arguments Forms 51 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nNotice how the consequent of each preceding conditional statement links up with the antecedent of the\nnext conditional statement in such a way as to create a chain. The chain could be as long as we liked, but\nthe rule that we will cite in our proofs only connects two different conditional statements together. As\nbefore, it is important to realize that any argument with this same form is a valid argument. For example,\n1. (A v B) \u2283 ~D\n2. ~D \u2283 C\n3. \u2234 (A v B) \u2283 C\nNotice that the consequent of the first premise and the antecedent of the second premise are exactly the\nsame term, \u201c~D\u201d. That is what allows us to \u201clink\u201d the antecedent of the first premise and the consequent\nof the second premise together in a \u201cchain\u201d to infer the conclusion. Being able to recognize the forms of\nthese inferences is an important skill that you will have to become proficient at in order to do proofs.\n6 Common Deductive Arguments Forms 52 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nUNIT TWO: INFORMAL FALLACIES1\nWhat is a fallacy? Simply put, a fallacy is an error in reasoning. It employs a method of reasoning to\nreach a conclusion that is usually incorrect, but the flaw isn\u2019t in the claims or conclusions, but rather in\nthe connections between them (although the method of reasoning can sometimes go right in informal\nfallacies, formal fallacies are always wrong and those will be covered later). A fallacy can arise for two\nreasons:\n(1) When we mistakenly assume that we have proven our conclusion when we have not\n(2) When we assume we have stronger evidence for the conclusion than we really do\nHence, when you commit a fallacy it typically means that you lack in some way the proper evidence\nnecessary to support your conclusion. A fallacy does not mean that the conclusion is necessary false, just\nthat the premises provided are not strong enough to show that the conclusion is in fact true. There are\nalso fallacies that have faulty inferences at their base, resulting in inappropriate logical steps leading to\nthe claimed conclusion. Why should we study fallacies? First, and most importantly, so that you don\u2019t\ncommit them. You want your reasoning to be proper, and the surest way to meet these goals is to avoid\nfallacies at all costs. Second, learning about fallacies is a great way to correct biases in your own\nreasoning that are maybe too deep to spot on your own. You\u2019d be amazed how much bad reasoning you\nlearn from parents, family, and friends, your culture, or the city you\u2019ve been raised in. This brings me to\nthe third point, you want to learn fallacies so you can see the errors in reasoning others commit:\nPoliticians, lawyers, newspaper reporters, bloggers, Wikipedia, etc. are just some of the list. Many times,\nfallacies don\u2019t just happen on accident; they are often committed with some kind of intent or reaction in\nmind. Spotting them enables you to make clear and educated choices about who and what to believe, to\nprevent falling prey to schemes or false opinions, and will enable you to communicate more effectively\nwith others.\n1 Noah Levin, 2018, printed here under a CC-BY license.\n6 Common Deductive Arguments FormsUNIT TWO: INFORMAL FALLACIES 53 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n7\nFallacies of Evidence1\nNon Sequitur Fallacy\n(Latin for \u201cdoes not follow\u201d) A logical fallacy that is most often absurd, where the premises have no\nlogical connection with or relevance to the conclusion.\nExample: The police have not been able to crack this homicide cold case, so they\u2019ve called a\npsychic in to help out. They have tried all the traditional police investigation methods and the\ncase still isn\u2019t solved. Therefore, the psychic (the non-traditional method) is needed.\nThe general idea is that some evidence is being presented without its connection with the intended\nconclusion being illustrated in any way.\nRed Herring\n(Latin: Ignoratio elenchi) This fallacy involves the raising of an irrelevant issue in the middle of an\nargument, derailing the original discussion, and causing the argument to contain two totally different and\nunrelated issues. A red herring has happened when you begin your argument about one thing and end up\narguing about something else entirely different. This fallacy renders any premises used logically\nunrelated to the conclusion. A red herring is a distraction tactic and is often used to avoid addressing\ncriticism or attack by an opponent. This device is most commonly seen in political debates.\nExample: The \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019 protesters complain that corporations and their money\ncontrol Washington. But how can we take them seriously when their camps are messy,\ndisorganized, with homeless people and drug addicts now living with them, and they are making\nlife hell for the shop owners in their area?\nStraw Man Fallacy\nLike the red herring, a straw man tends to happen when one person is criticizing or attacking another\u2019s\nposition or argument. It occurs when a person misrepresents or purposely distorts the position or\nargument of their opponent in order to weaken it, thus defeating it more easily. The name vividly depicts\nthe action: imagine two fighters in a ring, one of them builds a man made of straw (like a scarecrow),\nbeats it up horribly, and then declares victory. While doing this, his or her real opponent stands in the\nring, completely untouched. The straw man is considered to be one of the commonest fallacies; in\nparticular we see it in widely used in political, religious, and ethical debates.\nExample: The Leader of the Opposition is against the purchase of new submarines and\nhelicopters. Clearly he is okay with our country being defenseless and open to invasion by our\nenemies. He also obviously hates our country. So, be ready to learn a new language and give up\nall our freedoms!\n1 This section adapted from: Myers, et al. 2013. Clear and Present Thinking. Northwest Passage Books, v1.1.

A\nperson\u2019s character does not necessarily predict the truth or falsity of a proposition or argument. There\nare many flavors of this fallacy and they all attempt to win an argument fallaciously:\nAd hominem denier \u2013 rejects the claim the person is making\nExample: Mark said that Jill is the nicest person ever, but you should ignore everything Mark\nsays.\nAd hominem silencer \u2013 rejects one\u2019s ability to talk about the claim\nExample: All of Marx\u2019s economic doctrines are hogwash. But this was to be expected given he\nstudied only philosophy in university, not business, and he never even held down a regular job.\nAd hominem dismisser \u2013 rejects the reliability of the speaker\nExample: John said he saw me take the tacos, but he always lies about eating people\u2019s food, so\nyou shouldn\u2019t trust him.\nTu quoque ad hominem (\u201cYou too\u201d, or appeal to hypocrisy)\nExample: Why should I listen to you when you tell me to stop drinking? You\u2019re the biggest\ndrunk I know!\nOf course, if the person being attacked in an ad hominem really is guilty of the claim and it is relevant to\nthe argument, then attacking them in this fashion is not fallacious.\nNaturalistic Fallacy\n(Latin: argumentum ad Naturam) A fallacy that occurs when a person bases their argument of position\non the notion that what is natural is better or what \u2018ought to be\u2019. In other words, the foundation for the\nargument or position is a value judgment; the fallacy happens when the argument shifts from a statement\nof fact to one of value. The word \u2018natural\u2019 is loaded with positive evaluation, like the word \u2018normal\u2019, so\nimplied in the use of it is praise. One commonly sees this fallacy in moral arguments.\nExample: It is only natural to feel angry sometimes; therefore there is nothing wrong with feeling\nangry.\nAppeal to Authority\n(Latin: argumentum ad verecundiam) An attempt to prove a conclusion by an improper appealing to an\nauthority, and this appeal is considered improper when the authority is irrelevant and/or unrecognized.\nExample: My mom says if I eat watermelon seeds, a plant will grow in my belly and I\u2019ll turn\ngreen. Because my mom said it, it is true.\nIt should be noted here that not all appeals to authority are faulty. When you are sick, you do visit your\ndoctor and take their advice, and when you get into legal trouble you follow what a lawyer tells you. So,\nan appeal to authority can be relevant and proper when the authority you appeal to is (1) recognized as\nhaving authoritative expertise in that area, and (2) if we ourselves lack the information, the experience,\n7 Fallacies of Evidence 55 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nor cannot firsthand acquire the information required ourselves for the argument. To appeal to statements\nmade by Buzz Aldrin when speaking about the moon\u2019s surface is a proper application of authority. In\ngeneral, you should ask\n- Is the cited authority in fact an authority in the appropriate area?\n- Is this the kind of question that can now be settled by expert consensus?\n- Has the authority been cited correctly?\n- Can the cited authority be trusted to tell the truth?\n- Why is an appeal to authority being made at all?\nAppeal to Force\n(Latin: argumentum ad baculum) Any attempt to make someone accept a proposition or argument by\nusing some type of force or threat, possibly including the threat of violence. After all, threats do not\nestablish truth whatsoever.\nExample: Company policy concerning customer feedback is \u201cit\u2019s either perfect (100%) or we\nfailed (99% or less)\u201d. Anyone who doesn\u2019t support this will be fired.\nAppeal to Fear\nAny attempt to make someone accept a proposition or argument by using fear related to the concept as a\nmotivation.\nExample: Do you want Al-Qaeda to take over the world? No? Then you should vote to increase\nmilitary spending.\nAppeal to Pity\n(Latin: argumentum ad misericordiam) Any attempt to make someone accept a proposition or argument\nby arousing their emotions. A strong emotional appeal is meant to subvert someone\u2019s rational thinking.\nRemember: Pity alone does not establish truth.\nExample: The defendant should not be found guilty of this crime. Her life has been filled with\nendless abuse, a lack of love and respect, and so many hardships.\nAppeal to Tradition\n(Latin: argumentum ad antiquitatem) This fallacy happens when someone cites the historical\npreferences and practices of a culture or even a particular person, as evidence for a proposition or\nargument being correct. Traditions are often passed down from generation to generation, with the\nexplanation for continuity being \u201cthis is the way it has been done before\u201d, which is of course not a valid\nreason. The age of something does not entail its truth or falsity.\nExample: We have turkey for Thanksgiving dinner and duck for Christmas dinner every year,\nbecause that is how my parents and grandparents did it, so it\u2019s the right thing to do.\nAppeal to Novelty\n(Latin: argumentum ad novitatem) This fallacy is the opposite of appeal to tradition, in that it is the\nattempt to claim that the newness or modernity of something is evidence of its truth and superiority. The\nnovelty of the idea or proposition does not entail its truth or falsity.\n7 Fallacies of Evidence 56 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nExample: String Theory is a new and rising research area in particle physics, and therefore it\nmust be true.\nAppeal to Ignorance\n(Latin: argumentum ad Ignorantiam) The attempt to argue for or against a proposition or position\nbecause there is a lack of evidence against or for it: I argue X because there is no evidence showing not-\nX.\nExample: There is intelligent life on Neptune, for sure. Science has not found any evidence that\nthere isn\u2019t life there.\nAppeal to Popularity\n(Latin: argumentum ad numeram) The attempt to use the popularity of a position or premise as evidence\nfor its truthfulness. This is a fallacy because the popularity of something is irrelevant to its being true or\nfalse. It is one that sometimes is difficult to spot or prevent doing because common sense often dictates\nthat if something is popular it must be true and/or valid.\nExample: Eating quinoa daily is a healthy thing everyone is doing, so it must be the right choice.\nAgain, sometimes these can be non-fallacious. You have to ask the following questions:\n- Is this opinion actually widely held?\n- Is this the kind of area where popular opinion is likely to be right?\n- Why is an appeal to popular opinion being made?\n7 Fallacies of Evidence 57 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n8\nFallacies of Weak Induction1\nPost hoc ergo propter hoc\n(Latin for \u201cAfter this, therefore because of this\u201d) This fallacy happens when one argues that because X\nhappened immediately after Y, that Y was the cause of X. Or, when concerning event types: event type\nX happened immediately after event type Y, therefore event type Y caused event type X. In a sense, it is\njumping to a conclusion based upon coincidence, rather than on sufficient testing, repeated occurrence,\nor evidence.\nExample: The sun always rises a few minutes after the rooster crows. So, the rooster crowing\ncauses the sun to rise.\nExample: Once the government passed the new gun laws, gun violence dropped by 10%,\ntherefore the new gun laws are working and caused the occurrence of gun violence to drop.\nFallacy of Composition\n(Also known as exception fallacy) The fallacy of assuming that when a property applies to all members\nof a class, it must also apply to the class as a whole.\nExample: Every player in the NHL is wealthy; therefore, the NHL must be a wealthy\norganization.\nHowever, this type of reasoning is not always fallacious: Every scene in that movie is hilarious, so the\nmovie is hilarious.\nFallacy of Division\n(Also known as false division, or faulty division)\nThe fallacy of assuming that when a property applies to the class as a whole, it must also apply to every\nmember of that class as well.\nExample: The US Republican Party platform states that abortion is wrong and should be illegal.\nTherefore, every Republican must believe that abortion is wrong and should be illegal.\nHowever, this type of reasoning is not always fallacious: That sculpture of Pee Wee Herman is made of\nmetal, so his hand is made of metal.\nHasty Generalization\n(Also known as argument from small numbers, unrepresentative sample) This fallacy occurs most often\nin the realm of statistics. It happens when a conclusion or generalization is drawn about a population and\n1 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013. Clear and Present Thinking. Northwest Passage Books, v1.1.

The problem with a sample that is too\nsmall is that the variability in a population is not captured, so the conclusion is inaccurate.\nExample: My Grandfather drank a bottle of whiskey and smoked three cigars a day, and he lived\nto be 95 years old. Therefore, daily smoking and drinking cannot be that bad for you.\nBegging the Question\n(Latin: Petitio Principii) The fallacy of attempting to prove something by assuming the very thing you\nare trying to prove. Essentially, in order for one of the premises to be true, the conclusion must already\nbe true. This is very similar to a circular argument (see below), but it is subtly different.\nExample: The Bible is the word of God, God never lies, and the Bible says God exists, so God\nmust exist. (Note: In order for the Bible to be the word of God, you must assume God exists \u2013\nbut isn\u2019t that your conclusion?)\nExample #2: It\u2019s always wrong to murder human beings. Capital punishment involves murdering\nhuman beings. Therefore, capital punishment is wrong.\nNote that this is NOT \u201craising the question\u201d as \u201cbegging the question\u201d is often used:\n\u201cHe always carries around a knife, that begs the question, what he is scared of?\u201d\nCircular argument\nThe fallacy of proving something that you\u2019ve already assumed. Basically, your conclusion has already\nappeared as an assumption.\nExample: All of the statements in Smith\u2019s book Crab People Walk Among Us are true. Why, he\neven says in the preface that his book only contains true statements and firsthand stories.\nSelf-sealers\nA self-sealing argument is one that cannot possibly be wrong for one reason or another. Definitional\narguments or claims and conspiracy theories are perfect examples.\nExample (\u201ctrue by definition\u201d): The following is a clear example of a self-sealing statement:\nTwo weeks from today at 4:37PM you are going to be doing exactly what you will be doing.\nExample #2 (\u201cuniversal discounting\u201d): Aliens exist and the only reason we don\u2019t think they exist\nis because they\u2019re making us believe that.\nSo how do you deal with self-sealers? The best way is to just ignore them or not start an argument with\nsomeone who uses them in the first place. Also called \u201cgoing upstairs\u201d because instead of staying\ndownstairs and speaking with a highly irrational person, you\u2019d rather just go upstairs, put your\nheadphones, and listen to some Nickelback. This would appear to be the only situation where listening\nto Nickelback is preferable to the alternative. (Am I committing fallacy here in this line of reasoning?)\n8 Fallacies of Weak Induction 59 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n9\nFallacies of Ambiguity1\nLoaded Question Fallacy\n(Also known as complex question, fallacy of presupposition, trick question) The fallacy of asking a\nquestion that has a presupposition built in, which implies something (often questionable) but protects the\nperson asking the question from accusations of false claims or even slander.\nExample: Have you stopped beating your wife yet?\nThis question is a real \u2018catch 22\u2019 since to answer \u2018yes\u2019 implies that you used to beat your wife but have\nnow stopped, and to answer \u2018no\u2019 means you are still beating her. The question rests on the assumption\nthat you beat your wife, and so either answer to it seems to endorse that idea.\nEquivocation\n(Also known as doublespeak) A fallacy that occurs when one uses an ambiguous term or phrase in more\nthan one sense, thus rendering the argument misleading. The ambiguity in this fallacy is lexical and not\ngrammatical, meaning the term or phrase that is ambiguous has two distinct meanings. In other words, it\nhappens when one term is assumed to mean the same thing in two different contexts, but actually means\ntwo different things. One can often see equivocation in jokes.\nExample: Man is the only rational animal, and no woman is a man, so women are not rational.\nExample: If you don\u2019t pay your exorcist you can get repossessed.\nExample: A feather is light; whatever is light cannot be dark; therefore, a feather cannot be dark.\nAmphiboly\nA fallacy of ambiguity, where the ambiguity in question arises directly from the poor grammatical\nstructure in a sentence. The fallacy occurs when a bad argument relies on the grammatical ambiguity to\nsound strong and logical.\nExample: I\u2019m going to return this car to the dealer I bought this car from. Their ad said \u201cUsed\n1995 Ford Taurus with air conditioning, cruise, leather, new exhaust and chrome rims.\u201d But the\nchrome rims aren\u2019t new at all.\nThere are other kinds of amphiboly fallacies, like those of ambiguous pronoun reference: \u201cI took some\npictures of the dogs at the park playing, but they were not good.\u201d Does \u2018they\u2019 mean the dogs or the\npictures \u201cwere not good\u201d? And there is amphiboly when modifiers are misplaced, such as in a famous\nGroucho Marx joke: \u201cOne morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I\u2019ll\nnever know.\u201d\n1 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013. Clear and Present Thinking. Northwest Passage Books, v1.1.

To view a copy of this license, visit:\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/\n9 Fallacies of Ambiguity 60 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nFallacy of the Undistributed Middle\n(Also known as undistributed middle term) A formal fallacy that occurs in a categorical syllogism (we\u2019ll\nlook at these next week), when the middle term is undistributed is not distributed at least in one premise.\nAccording to the rules of categorical syllogism, the middle term must be distributed at least once for it to\nbe valid.\nExample of the form: All X\u2019s are Y\u2019s; All Z\u2019s are Y\u2019s; Therefore, All X\u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nExample in words: All ghosts are spooky; all zombies are spooky; therefore all ghosts are\nzombies.\nWeak Analogy\n(Also known as faulty analogy, questionable analogy) While arguments from analogy will be covered in\nmore detail later in this work, it is worth covering the fallacy of weak analogies right now. When\nsomeone uses an analogy to prove or disprove an argument or position by using an analogy that is too\ndissimilar to be effective. Two important things to remember about analogies: No analogy is perfect, and\neven the most dissimilar objects can share some commonality or similarity. Analogies are neither true\nnor false, but come in degrees from identical or similar to extremely dissimilar or different.\nExample: Not believing in the monster under the bed because you have yet to see it is like not\nbelieving the Titanic sank because no one saw it hit the bottom.\nVacuity\nVacuous arguments are arguments that say nothing. Here is generally the correct format of\nargumentation:\n- A asserts that p is true.\n- B raises objections x, y, and z against it.\n- A then offers reasons to overcome these objections.\nVacuous arguments don\u2019t exactly follow this format. Vacuous arguments don\u2019t really make an argument\n\u2013 they don\u2019t add anything to our knowledge. They don\u2019t make a series of statements and point them at\nsomething new. For this reason, you can\u2019t exactly argue with them \u2013 you can point out the flaw in\nreasoning, but there isn\u2019t really an argument to refute.\nExample: John, \u201cCoconuts are the best food ever.\u201d Jack, \u201cI once had a cat named Coconut.\u201d\nFalse Dilemma\n(Also known as false dichotomy, black-and-white fallacy) A fallacy that happens when only two choices\nare offered in an argument or proposition, when in fact a greater number of possible choices exist\nbetween the two extremes. False dilemmas typically contain \u2018either, or\u2019 in their structure. They often try\nto force the person into adopting one of the positions by making one option unacceptable.\nExample: Either you help us kill the zombies, or you love them.\n9 Fallacies of Ambiguity 61 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n10\nDetection of Fallacies in Ordinary\nLanguage1\nFallacies occur constantly, and there is no better place to see them in a political debate. Observe 5\nminutes of any political debate between 2 or more candidates and do the following:\n1) When a fallacy is said, pause the video, mark down the fallacy by noting what type of\nfallacy it is.\n2) Identify the conclusion that the person was trying to reach and the premises being used to\nreach that conclusion.\n3) Why do you think the fallacy was committed? Was it on accident or on purpose?\n4) Is there a way of fixing the argument to avoid fallacies?\n5) Did committing the fallacy hurt the candidate\u2019s overall strength in the debate? Why or\nwhy not?\nYou should have at least 20 fallacies after 5 minutes if you were paying close attention. Yes, that\u2019s how\ncommon fallacies are even for the best orators.\nHere is an excellent visual example of recognizing fallacies in real life. It is too large and complicated to\nbe printed here, but it is a categorization of fallacies in a paper written against Same Sex Marriage by a\nCatholic Bishop. It is a very detailed and careful analysis and is a good example of just how many\nfallacies are committed in public debates and how committing the argument itself may sound appealing\nto many people before recognizing the extent to which the argument is fallacious:\nhttp://infobeautiful2.s3.amazonaws.com/RhetoricalFallacy_SameSexMarriage.png\n1 Noah Levin, 2018, printed here under a CC-BY license\n10 Detection of Fallacies in Ordinary Language 62 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n11\nSearching Your Essays for Fallacies1\nWhen it comes to writing your own arguments and finding fallacies, it can be hard to spot them yourself.\nIt is often very helpful to have someone else read through it and spot fallacies for you (assuming they\nhave training in logic). However, if you are attempting to find and resolve any fallacies for yourself in\nyour own essays, you should do the following:\n1) Whenever you are making an argument, clearly identify the conclusion you are trying to\nreach and the premises you are using to arrive at the conclusion.\n2) Check the premises to see if they are actually relevant in the argument you are making and if\nthey all connect to each other.\n3) Check to see that the premises actually lead to the conclusion in the right ways to support it.\nGoing through your essay slowly and carefully in this fashion can help you find and fix any fallacies\nbefore others even see them. Mostly, you just need to be sure that what you\u2019re saying actually does\nproperly lead to the conclusions you are attempting to convince others to accept. Usually you\u2019ll go\nwrong by bringing in claims that just don\u2019t matter for what you\u2019re saying. Here\u2019s the most important\nthing to remember about relevance of the claims when it comes to writing argumentative essays: If you\nsay something that doesn\u2019t relate to your argument, I really don\u2019t care. Why, you ask? Because it would\nbe irrelevant. Like if I say, \u201cMy friend Steve Weimer is the best fantasy baseball player I know because\nhe always wins, he follows every game, he\u2019s won major tournaments, and he\u2019s six feet tall.\u201d Being six\nfeet tall has nothing to do with being good at fantasy baseball \u2013 at least I truly hope not, or I\u2019m doomed\nto failure.\n1 Noah Levin, 2018, printed here under a CC-BY license.\n11 Searching Your Essays for Fallacies 63 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nUNIT THREE: SENTENTIAL LOGIC1\nYou have seen the basics of how arguments work and the fundamental building blocks of our logical\nthinking. The next step is putting them together in a more formal fashion and use the language and\noperations of logic to create deductive arguments. The purpose of logic is to figure out what new\ninformation we can obtain from information we already have, and sentential logic is the most direct and\npurest way we have of doing this.\n1 Noah Levin, 2019, printed here under a CC-BY license.\nUNIT THREE: SENTENTIAL LOGIC 64 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n12\nWhy Sentential Logic?1\nAristotle\u2019s logic was great. It had a two-plus millennium run as the only game in town. As recently as\nthe late 18th century (remember, Aristotle did his work in the 4th century BCE), the great German\nphilosopher Immanuel Kant remarked that \u201csince the time of Aristotle [logic] has not had to go a single\nstep backwards\u2026 [and] it has also been unable to take a single step forward, and therefore seems to all\nappearance to be finished and complete.\u201d2\nThat may have been the appearance in Kant\u2019s time, but only because of an accident of history. In his\nown time, in ancient Greece, Aristotle\u2019s system had a rival\u2014the logic of the Stoic school, culminating in\nthe work of Chrysippus. Recall, for Aristotle, the fundamental logical unit was the class; and since terms\npick out classes, his logic is often referred to as a \u201cterm logic\u201d. For the Stoics, the fundamental logical\nunit was the proposition; since sentences pick out propositions, we could call this a \u201csentential logic\u201d.\nThese two approaches to logic were developed independently. Because of the vicissitudes of intellectual\nhistory (more later commentators promoted Aristotelian Logic, original writings from Chrysippus didn\u2019t\nsurvive, etc.), it turned out that Aristotle\u2019s approach was the one passed on to future generations, while\nthe Stoic approach lay dormant. However, in the 19th century, thanks to work by logicians like George\nBoole (and many others), the propositional approach was revived and developed into a formal system.\nWhy is this alternative approach valuable? One of the concerns we had when we were introducing\nAristotelian Logic was that, because of the restriction to categorical propositions, we would be limited in\nthe number and variety of actual arguments we could evaluate. We brushed aside these concerns with a\n(somewhat vague) promise that, as a matter of fact, lots of sentences that were not standard form\ncategoricals could be translated into that form. Furthermore, the restriction to categorical syllogisms was\nsimilarly unproblematic (we assured ourselves), because lots of arguments that are not standard form\nsyllogisms could be rendered as (possibly a series of) such arguments.\nThese assurances are true in a large number of cases. But there are some very simple arguments that\nresist translation into strict Aristotelian form, and for which we would like to have a simple method for\njudging them valid. Here is one example:\nEither Clinton will win the election or Trump will win the election.\nTrump will not win the election.\n/ \u2234 Clinton will win the election.\nNone of the sentences in this argument is in standard form. And while the argument has two premises\nand a conclusion, it is not a categorical syllogism. Could we translate it into that form? Well, we can\nmake some progress on the second premise and the conclusion, noting\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 Kant, I. 1997. Critique of Pure Reason. Guyer, P. and Wood, A. (tr.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 106.\n12 Why Sentential Logic? 65 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nthat there\u2019s a simple trick for transforming sentences with singular terms (names like \u2018Clinton\u2019 and\n\u2018Trump\u2019) into categoricals: let those names be class terms referring to the unit class containing the\nperson they refer to, then render the sentences as universal. So the conclusion, \u2018Clinton will win the\nelection\u2019 can be rewritten in standard form as \u2018All Clintons are electionwinners\u2019, where \u2018Clintons\u2019 refers\nto the unit class containing only Hillary Clinton. Similarly, \u2018Trump will not win the election\u2019 could be\nrewritten as a universal negative: \u2018No Trumps are election-winners\u2019. The first premise, however,\npresents some difficulty: how do I render an either/or claim as a categorical? What are my two classes?\nWell, election-winners is still in the mix, apparently. But what to do with Clinton and Trump? Here\u2019s an\nidea: stick them together into the same class (they\u2019re not gonna like this), a class containing just the two\nof them. Let\u2019s call the class \u2018candidates\u2019. Then this universal affirmative plausibly captures the meaning\nof the original premise: \u2018All election-winners are candidates\u2019. So now we have this:\nAll election-winners are candidates.\nNo Trumps are election-winners.\n/ \u2234 All Clintons are election-winners.\nAt least all the propositions are now categoricals. The problem is, this is not a categorical syllogism.\nThose are supposed to involve exactly three classes; this argument has four\u2014Clintons, Trumps,\nelection-winners, and candidates. True, candidates is just a composite class made by combining Clintons\nand Trumps, so you can make a case that there are really only three classes here. But, in a categorical\nsyllogism, each of the class terms in supposed to occur exactly twice.\n\u2018Election-winners\u2019 occurs in all three, and I don\u2019t see how I can eliminate one of those occurrences.\nUgh. This is giving me a headache. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard to analyze this argument. You don\u2019t have to\nbe a logician (or a logic student who\u2019s made it through three chapters of this book) to recognize that the\nTrump/Clinton argument is a valid one. Pick a random person off the street, show them that argument,\nand ask them if it\u2019s any good. They\u2019ll say it is. It\u2019s easy for regular people to make such a judgment;\nshouldn\u2019t it be easy for a logic to make that judgment, too? Aristotle\u2019s logic doesn\u2019t seem to be up to the\ntask. We need an alternative approach.\nThis particular example is exactly the kind of argument that begs for a proposition-focused logic, as\nopposed to a class-focused logic like Aristotle\u2019s. If we take whole propositions as our fundamental\nlogical unit, we can see that the form of this argument\u2014the thing, remember, that determines its\nvalidity\u2014is something like this:\nEither p or q\nNot q\n/ \u2234 p\nIn this schema, \u2018p\u2019 stands for the proposition that Clinton will win and \u2018q\u2019 for the proposition that Trump\nwill win. It\u2019s easy to see that this is a valid form.3 This is the advantage of switching to a sentential,\n3 This form is often called the \u201cDisjunctive Syllogism\u201d. Notice that the word \u2018syllogism\u2019 is used there. By the Middle Ages,\nStoic Logic hadn\u2019t disappeared entirely. Rather, bits of it were simply added on the Aristotelian system. So, it was traditional\n12 Why Sentential Logic? 66 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nrather than a term, logic. It makes it easy to analyze this and many other argument forms.\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the basics of the proposition-centered approach to deductive logic\u2014\nSentential Logic. As was the case with Aristotle\u2019s logic, Sentential Logic must accomplish three tasks:\n1. Tame natural language.\n2. Precisely define logical form.\n3. Develop a way to test logical forms for validity.\nThe approach to the first task\u2014taming natural language\u2014will differ substantially from Aristotle\u2019s.\nWhereas Aristotelian Logic worked within a well-behaved portion of natural language\u2014the sentences\nexpressing categorical propositions\u2014Sentential Logic steps outside of natural language entirely,\nconstructing an artificial language and only evaluating arguments expressed in its terms. This move, of\ncourse, raises the concern we had about the applicability to everyday arguments even more acutely: what\ngood is a logic if it doesn\u2019t evaluate English arguments at all? What we must show to alleviate this\nconcern is that there is a systematic relationship between our artificial language and our natural one\n(English); we must show how to translate between the two\u2014and how translating from English into the\nartificial language results in the removal of imprecision and unruliness, the taming of natural language.\nWe will call our artificial language \u201cSL,\u201d short for \u2018Sentential Logic\u2019. In constructing a language, we\nmust specify its syntax and its semantics. The syntax of a language is the rules governing what counts as\na well-formed construction within that language; that is, syntax is the language\u2019s grammar. Syntax is\nwhat tells me that \u2018What a handsome poodle you have there.\u2019 is a well-formed English construction,\nwhile \u2018Poodle a handsome there you what have.\u2019 is not. The semantics of a language is an account of the\nmeanings of its well-formed bits. If you know what a sentence means, then you know what it takes for it\nto express a truth or a falsehood. So semantics tells you under what conditions a given proposition is\ntrue or false.4 Our discussion of the semantics of SL will reveal its relationship to English and tell us\nhow to translate between the two languages.\n(and still is in many logic textbooks), when discussing Aristotelian Logic, to present this form, along with some others, as\nadditional valid forms (supplementing Barbara, Datisi, and the rest). But this conflation of the two traditions obscures the\nfundamental difference between a class-centered approach to logic and one focused on propositions. These should be kept\ndistinct.\n4 That\u2019s actually a controversial claim about the role of semantics. Your humble author, for example, is one of the weirdos\nwho thinks it not true (of natural language, at least). But let\u2019s leave those deviant linguists and philosophers (and their\nabstruse arguments) to one side and just say: semantics gives you truth-conditions. That\u2019s certainly true of our artificial\nlanguage SL.\n12 Why Sentential Logic? 67 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n13\nSyntax of Sentential Logic1\nFirst, we cover syntax. This discussion will give us some clues as to the relationship between SL and\nEnglish, but a full accounting of that relationship will have to wait, as we said, for the discussion of\nsemantics.\nWe can distinguish, in English, between two types of (declarative) sentences: simple and compound. A\nsimple sentence is one that does not contain any other sentence as a component part. A compound\nsentence is one that contains at least one other sentence as a component part. (We will not give a\nrigorous definition of what it is for one sentence to be a component part of another sentence. Rather, we\nwill try to establish an intuitive grasp of the relation by giving examples, and stipulate that a rigorous\ndefinition could be provided, but is too much trouble to bother with.) \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical\u2019 is a simple\nsentence; none of its parts is itself a sentence.2 \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and James Brown is alive\u2019 is a\ncompound sentence: it contains two simple sentences as component parts\u2014namely, \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical\u2019\nand \u2018James Brown is alive\u2019.\nIn SL, we will use capital letters\u2014\u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019, \u2026, \u2018Z\u2019\u2014to stand for simple sentences. Our practice\nwill be simply to choose capital letters for simple sentences that are easy to remember. For example, we\ncan choose \u2018B\u2019 to stand for \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical\u2019 and \u2018J\u2019 to stand for \u2018James Brown is alive\u2019. Easy\nenough. The hard part is symbolizing compound sentences in SL. How would we handle \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is\nlogical and James Brown is alive\u2019, for example? Well, we\u2019ve got capital letters to stand for the simple\nparts of the sentence, but that leaves out the word \u2018and\u2019. We need more symbols.\nWe will distinguish five different kinds of compound sentence, and introduce a special SL symbol for\neach. Again, at this stage we are only discussing the syntax of SL\u2014the rules for combining its symbols\ninto well-formed constructions. We will have some hints about the semantics of these new symbols\u2014\nhints about their meanings\u2014but a full treatment of that topic will not come until the next section.\nConjunctions\nThe first type of compound sentence is one that we\u2019ve already seen. Conjunctions are, roughly, \u2018and\u2019-\nsentences\u2014sentences like \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and James Brown is alive\u2019. We\u2019ve already decided to let\n\u2018B\u2019 stand for \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical\u2019 and to let \u2018J\u2019 stand for \u2018James Brown is alive\u2019. What we need is a\nsymbol that stands for \u2018and\u2019. In SL, that symbol is a \u201cdot\u201d. It looks like this: \u2022.\nTo form a conjunction in SL, we simply stick the dot between the two component letters, thus:\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 You might think \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is\u2019 is a part of the sentence that qualifies as a sentence itself\u2014a sentence claiming that she exists,\nmaybe. But that won\u2019t do. The word \u2018is\u2019 in the original sentence is the \u201c\u2018is\u2019 of predication\u201d\u2014a mere linking verb; \u2018Beyonc\u00e9\nis\u2019 only counts as a sentence if you change the meaning of \u2018is\u2019 to the \u201c\u2018is\u2019 of existence\u201d. Anyway, stop causing trouble. This\nis why we didn\u2019t give a rigorous definition of \u2018component part\u2019; we\u2019d get bogged down in these sorts of arcane distinctions.\n13 Syntax of Sentential Logic 68 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nB \u2022 J\nThat is the SL version of \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and James Brown is alive\u2019.\nA note on terminology. A conjunction has two components, one on either side of the dot. We will refer\nto these as the \u201cconjuncts\u201d of the conjunction. If we need to be specific, we might refer to the \u201cleft-hand\nconjunct\u201d (\u2018B\u2019 in this case) or the \u201cright-hand conjunct\u201d (\u2018J\u2019 in this case).\nDisjunctions\nDisjunctions are, roughly, \u2018or\u2019-sentences\u2014sentences like \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical or James Brown is alive\u2019.\nSometimes, the \u2018or\u2019 is accompanied by the word \u2018either\u2019, as in \u2018Either Beyonc\u00e9 is logical or James\nBrown is alive\u2019. Again, we let \u2018B\u2019 stand for \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical\u2019 and let \u2018J\u2019 stand for \u2018James Brown is\nalive\u2019. What we need is a symbol that stands for \u2018or\u2019 (or \u2018either/or\u2019). In SL, that symbol is a \u201cwedge\u201d. It\nlooks like this: \u2228.\nTo form a conjunction in SL, we simply stick the wedge between the two component letters, thus:\nB \u2228 J\nThat is the SL version of \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical or James Brown is alive\u2019.\nA note on terminology. A disjunction has two components, one on either side of the wedge. We will\nrefer to these as the \u201cdisjuncts\u201d of the disjunction. If we need to be specific, we might refer to the \u201cleft-\nhand disjunct\u201d (\u2018B\u2019 in this case) or the \u201cright-hand disjunct\u201d (\u2018J\u2019 in this case).\nNegations\nNegations are, roughly, \u2018not\u2019-sentences\u2014sentences like \u2018James Brown is not alive\u2019. You may find it\nsurprising that this would be considered a compound sentence. It is not immediately clear how any\ncomponent part of this sentence is itself a sentence. Indeed, if the definition of \u2018component part\u2019 (which\nwe intentionally have not provided) demanded that parts of sentences contain only contiguous words\n(words next to each other), you couldn\u2019t come up with a part of \u2018James Brown is not alive\u2019 that is itself a\nsentence. But that is not a condition on \u2018component part\u2019. In fact, this sentence does contain another\nsentence as a component part\u2014namely, \u2018James Brown is alive\u2019. This can be made more clear if we\nparaphrase the original sentence. \u2018James Brown is not alive\u2019 means the same thing as \u2018It is not the case\nthat James Brown is alive\u2019. Now we have all the words in \u2018James Brown is alive\u2019 next to each other; it is\nclearly a component part of the larger, compound sentence. We have \u2018J\u2019 to stand for the simple\ncomponent; we need a symbol for \u2018it is not the case that\u2019. In SL, that symbol is a \u201ctilde\u201d. It looks like\nthis: ~.\nTo form a negation in SL, we simply prefix a tilde to the simpler component being negated:\n13 Syntax of Sentential Logic 69 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n~ J\nThis is the SL version of \u2018James Brown is not alive\u2019.\nConditionals\nConditionals are, roughly, \u2018if/then\u2019 sentences\u2014sentences like \u2018If Beyonc\u00e9 is logical, then James Brown\nis alive\u2019. (James Brown is actually dead. But suppose Beyonc\u00e9 is a \u201cJames Brown-truther\u201d, a thing that I\njust made up. She claims that James Brown faked his death, that the Godfather of Soul is still alive,\ngetting funky in some secret location.3 In that case, the conditional sentence might make sense.) Again,\nwe let \u2018B\u2019 stand for \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical\u2019 and let \u2018J\u2019 stand for \u2018James Brown is alive\u2019. What we need is a\nsymbol that stands for the \u2018if/then\u2019 part. In SL, that symbol is a \u201chorseshoe\u201d. It looks like this: \u2283.\nTo form a conditional in SL, we simply stick the horseshoe between the two component letters (where\nthe word \u2018then\u2019 occurs), thus:\nB \u2283 J\nThat is the SL version of \u2018If Beyonc\u00e9 is logical, then James Brown is alive\u2019.\nA note on terminology. Unlike our treatment of conjunctions and disjunctions, we will distinguish\nbetween the two components of the conditional. The component to the left of the horseshoe will be\ncalled the \u201cantecedent\u201d of the conditional; the component after the horseshoe is its \u201cconsequent\u201d. As we\nwill see when we get to the semantics for SL, there is a good reason for distinguishing the two\ncomponents.\nBiconditionals\nBiconditionals are, roughly, \u2018if and only if\u2019-sentences\u2014sentences like \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical if and only if\nJames Brown is alive\u2019. (This is perhaps not a familiar locution. We will talk more about what it means\nwhen we discuss semantics.) Again, we let \u2018B\u2019 stand for \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical\u2019 and let \u2018J\u2019 stand for \u2018James\nBrown is alive\u2019. What we need is a symbol that stands for the \u2018if and only if\u2019 part. In SL, that symbol is\na \u201ctriple-bar\u201d. It looks like this: \u2261.\nTo form a biconditional in SL, we simply stick the triple-bar between the two component letters, thus:\nB \u2261 J\nThat is the SL version of \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical if and only if James Brown is alive\u2019.\nThere are no special names for the components of the biconditional.\n3 Play along.\n13 Syntax of Sentential Logic 70 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nPunctuation \u2013 Parentheses\nOur language, SL, is quite austere: so far, we have only 31 different symbols\u2014the 26 capital letters, and\nthe five symbols for the five different types of compound sentence. We will now add two more: the left-\nand right-hand parentheses. And that\u2019ll be it.\nWe use parentheses in SL for one reason (and one reason only): to remove ambiguity. To see how this\nworks, it will be helpful to draw an analogy between SL and the language of simple arithmetic. The\nlatter has a limited number of symbols as well: numbers, signs for the arithmetical operations (addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, division), and parentheses. The parentheses are used in arithmetic for\ndisambiguation. Consider this combination of symbols:\n2 + 3 x 5\nAs it stands, this formula is ambiguous. I don\u2019t know whether this is a sum or a product; that is, I don\u2019t\nknow which operator\u2014the addition sign or the multiplication sign\u2014is the main operator.4 We can use\nparentheses to disambiguate, and we can do so in two different ways:\n(2 + 3) x 5\nor\n2 + (3 x 5)\nAnd of course, where we put the parentheses makes a big difference. The first formula is a product; the\nmultiplication sign is the main operator. It comes out to 25. The second formula is a sum; the addition\nsign is the main operator. And it comes out to 17. Different placement of parentheses, different results.\nThis same sort of thing is going to arise in SL. We use the same term we use to refer to the addition and\nmultiplication signs\u2014\u2018operator\u2019\u2014to refer to dot, wedge, tilde, horseshoe, and triple-bar. (As we will see\nwhen we look at the semantics for SL, this is entirely proper, since the SL operators stand for\nmathematical functions on truth-values.) There are ways of combining SL symbols into compound\nformulas with more than one operator; and just as is the case in arithmetic, without parentheses, these\nformulas would be ambiguous. Let\u2019s look at an example.\nConsider this sentence: \u2018If Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and James Brown is alive, then I\u2019m the Queen of\nEngland\u2019. This is a compound sentence, but it contains both the word \u2018and\u2019 and the \u2018if/then\u2019\nconstruction. And it has three simple components: the two that we\u2019re used to by now about Beyonc\u00e9 and\nJames Brown, which we\u2019ve been symbolizing with \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018J\u2019, respectively, and a new one\u2014\u2018I\u2019m the\nQueen of England\u2019\u2014which we may as well symbolize with a \u2018Q\u2019. Based on what we already know\nabout how SL symbols work, we would render the sentence like this:\n4 You may have learned an \u201corder of operations\u201d in grade school, according to which multiplication takes precedence over\naddition, so that there would be no ambiguity in this expression. But the order of operations is just a (mostly arbitrary) way of\nremoving ambiguity that would be there without it. The point is, absent some sort of disambiguating convention\u2014whether\nit\u2019s parentheses or an order of operations\u2014the meanings of expressions like this are indeterminate.\n13 Syntax of Sentential Logic 71 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nB \u2022 J \u2283 Q\nBut just as was the case with the arithmetical example above, this formula is ambiguous. I don\u2019t know\nwhat kind of compound sentence this is\u2014a conjunction or a conditional. That is, I don\u2019t know which of\nthe two operators\u2014the dot or the horseshoe\u2014is the main operator. In order to disambiguate, we need to\nadd some parentheses. There are two ways this can go, and we need to decide which of the two options\ncorrectly captures the meaning of the original sentence:\n(B \u2022 J) \u2283 Q\nor\nB \u2022 (J \u2283 Q)\nThe first formula is a conditional; horseshoe is its main operator, and its antecedent is a compound\nsentence (the conjunction \u2018B \u2022 J\u2019). The second formula is a conjunction; dot is its main operator, and its\nright-hand conjunct is a compound sentence (the conditional \u2018J \u2283 Q\u2019). We need to decide which of these\ntwo formulations correctly captures the meaning of the English sentence \u2018If Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and\nJames Brown is alive, then I\u2019m the Queen of England\u2019.\nThe question is, what kind of compound sentence is the original? Is it a conditional or a conjunction? It\nis not a conjunction. Conjunctions are, roughly (again, we\u2019re not really doing semantics yet), \u2018and\u2019-\nsentences. When you utter a conjunction, you\u2019re committing yourself to both of the conjuncts. If I say,\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is logical and James Brown is alive,\u201d I\u2019m telling you that both of those things are true. If we\nconstrue the present sentence as a conjunction, properly symbolized as \u2018B \u2022 (J \u2283 Q)\u2019, then we take it that\nthe person uttering the sentence is committed to both conjuncts; she\u2019s telling us that two things are true:\n(1) Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and (2) if James Brown is alive then she\u2019s the Queen of England. So, if we take\nthis to be a conjunction, we\u2019re interpreting the speaker as committed to the proposition that Beyonc\u00e9 is\nlogical. But clearly she\u2019s not. She uttered \u2018If Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and James Brown is alive, then I\u2019m the\nQueen of England\u2019 to express dubiousness about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s logicality (and James Brown\u2019s status among\nthe living). This sentence is not a conjunction; it is a conditional. It\u2019s saying that if those two things are\ntrue (about Beyonc\u00e9 and James Brown), then I\u2019m the Queen of England. The utterer doubts both\nconjuncts in the antecedent. The proper symbolization of this sentence is the first one above: \u2018(B \u2022 J) \u2283\nQ\u2019.\nAgain, in SL, parentheses have one purpose: to remove ambiguity. We only use them for that. This kind\nof ambiguity arises in formulas, like the one just discussed, involving multiple instances of the operators\ndot, wedge, horseshoe, and triple-bar.\nNotice that I didn\u2019t mention the tilde there. Tilde is different from the other four. Dot, wedge, horseshoe,\nand triple-bar are what we might call \u201ctwo-place operators\u201d. There are two simpler components in\nconjunctions, disjunctions, conditionals, and biconditionals. Negations, on the other hand, have only one\nsimpler component; hence, we might call tilde a \u201cone-place operator\u201d. It only operates on one thing: the\n13 Syntax of Sentential Logic 72 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nsentence it negates.\nThis distinction is relevant to our discussion of parentheses and ambiguity. We will adopt a convention\naccording to which the tilde negates the first well-formed SL construction immediately to its right. This\nconvention will have the effect of removing potential ambiguity without the need for parentheses.\nConsider the following combination of SL symbols:\n~ A \u2228 B\nIt may appear that this formula is ambiguous, with the following two possible ways of disambiguating:\n~ (A \u2228 B)\nor\n(~ A) \u2228 B\nBut this is not the case. Given our convention\u2014tilde negates the first well-formed SL construction\nimmediately to its right\u2014the original formula\u2014\u2018~ A \u2228 B\u2019\u2014is not ambiguous; it is well-formed. Since\n\u2018A\u2019 is itself a well-formed SL construction (of the simplest kind), the tilde in \u2018~ A \u2228 B\u2019 negates the \u2018A\u2019\nonly. This means that we don\u2019t have to indicate this fact with parentheses, as in the second of the two\npotential disambiguations above. That kind of formula, with parentheses around a tilde and the item it\nnegates, is not a well-formed construction in SL. Given our convention about tildes, the parentheses\naround \u2018~ A\u2019 are redundant.\nThe first potential disambiguation\u2014\u2018~ (A \u2228 B)\u2019\u2014is well-formed, and it means something different\nfrom \u2018~ A \u2228 B\u2019. In the former, the tilde negates the entire disjunction, \u2018A \u2228 B\u2019; in the latter, it only\nnegates \u2018A\u2019. That makes a difference. Again, an analogy to arithmetic is helpful here. Compare the\nfollowing two formulas:\n- (2 + 5)\nvs.\n-2 + 5\nIn the first, the minus-sign covers the entire sum, and so the result is -7; in the second, it only covers the\n2, so the result is 3. This is exactly analogous to the difference between \u2018~ (A \u2228 B)\u2019 and \u2018~ A \u2228 B\u2019. The\ntilde has wider scope in the first formula, and that makes a difference. The difference can only be\nexplained in terms of meaning\u2014which means it is time to turn our attention to the semantics of SL.\n13 Syntax of Sentential Logic 73 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n14\nSemantics of Sentential Logic1\nOur task is to give precise meanings to all of the well-formed formulas of SL. We will refer to these,\nquite sensibly, as \u201csentences of SL\u201d. Some of this task is already complete. We know something about\nthe meanings to the 26 capital letters: they stand for simple English sentences of our choosing. While the\nsemantics for a natural language like English is complicated (What is the meaning of a sentence? Its\ntruth-conditions? The proposition expressed? Are those two things the same? Is it something else\nentirely? Ugh.), the semantics for SL sentences is simple: all we care about is truth-value. A sentence in\nSL can have one of two semantic values: true or false. That\u2019s it.\nThis is one of the ways in which the move to SL is a taming of natural language. In SL, every sentence\nhas a determinate truth-value; and there are only two choices: true or false. English and other natural\nlanguages are more complicated than this. Of course, there\u2019s the issue of nondeclarative sentences,\nwhich don\u2019t express propositions and don\u2019t have truth-values at all.2 But even if we restrict ourselves to\ndeclarative English sentences, things don\u2019t look quite as simple as they are in SL. Consider the sentence\n\u2018Napoleon was short\u2019. You may not be aware that the popular conception of the French Emperor as\ndiminutive in stature has its roots in British propaganda at the time. As a matter of fact, he was about 5\u2019\n7\u201d. Is that short? Well, not at the time (late 18th, early 19th centuries); people were shorter back then\n(nutrition wasn\u2019t what it is these days, e.g.), and so Napoleon was about average or slightly above.\nPeople are taller now, though, so 5\u2019 7\u201d might be considered short. At least, short for a man. A grown\nman, that is. I mean, a grown man who\u2019s not a dwarf. Er, also, a grown non-dwarf man of French\nextraction (he\u2019d be a tall man in Cambodia, for example, where the average height is only 5\u2019 4\u201d). The\naverage height for a modern Frenchman is 5\u2019 9.25\u201d. Napoleon is 2.25 inches shorter than average. Is that\nshort? Heck, I don\u2019t know!\nThe problem here is that relative terms like \u2018short\u2019 have borderline cases; they\u2019re vague. It\u2019s not clear\nhow to assign a truth-value to sentences like \u2018Napoleon is short\u2019. So, in English, we might say that they\nlack a truth-value (absent some explicit specification of the relevant standards). Logics that are more\nsophisticated than our SL have developed ways to deal with these sorts of cases. Instead of just two\ntruth-values, some logics add more. There are three-values logics, where you have true, false, and\nneither. So we could say \u2018Napoleon is short\u2019 is neither. There are logics with infinitely many truth-\nvalues between true and false (where false is zero and true is 1, and every real number in between is a\ndegree of truth); in such a system, we could assign, I don\u2019t know, .62 to the proposition that Napoleon is\nshort. The point is, English and other natural languages are messy when it comes to truth-value. We\u2019re\ntaming them in SL by assuming that every SL sentence has a determinate truth-value, and that there are\nonly two truth-values: true and false\u2014which we will indicate, by the way, with the letters \u2018T\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019.\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 Pausing briefly to note, once again, that this talk of sentences, rather than the propositions that they express, having truth-\nvalues is a bit fast and loose. Reaffirming our earlier stance on this: not a big deal.\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 74 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nOur task from here is to provide semantics for the five operators: tilde, dot, wedge, triple-bar, and\nhorseshoe (we start with tilde because it\u2019s the simplest, and we save horseshoe for last because it\u2019s quite\na bit more involved). We will specify the meanings of these symbols in terms of their effects on truth-\nvalue: what is the truth-value of a compound sentence featuring them as the main operator, given the\ntruth-values of the components? The semantic values of the operators will be truthfunctions: systematic\naccounts of the truth-value outputs (of the compound sentence) resulting from the possible truth-value\ninputs (of the simpler components).\nNegations (TILDE)\nBecause tilde is a one-place operator, this is the simplest operator to deal with. The general form of a\nnegation is ~ p, where \u2018p\u2019 is a variable standing for any generic SL sentence, simple or compound. As a\nlower-case letter, \u2018p\u2019 is not part of our language (SL); rather, it\u2019s a tool we use to talk about our\nlanguage\u2014to refer to generic well-formed constructions within it.\nWe need to give an account of the meaning of the tilde in terms of its effect on truth-value. Tilde, as we\nsaid, is the SL equivalent of \u2018not\u2019 or \u2018it is not the case that\u2019. Let\u2019s think about what happens in English\nwhen we use those terms. If we take a true sentence, say \u2018Edison invented the light bulb\u2019, and form a\ncompound with it and \u2018not\u2019, we get \u2018Edison did not invent the light bulb\u2019\u2014a falsehood. If we take a\nfalse sentence, like \u2018James Brown is alive\u2019, and negate it, we get \u2018James Brown is not alive\u2019\u2014a truth.\nEvidently, the effect of negation on truth-value is to turn a truth into a falsehood, and a falsehood into a\ntruth. We can represent this graphically, using what we\u2019ll call a \u201ctruth-table.\u201d The following table gives\na complete specification of the semantics of tilde:\np ~ p\nT F\nF T\nIn the left-hand column, we have \u2018p\u2019, which, as a variable, stands for a generic, unspecified SL sentence.\nSince it\u2019s unspecified, we don\u2019t know its truth-value; but since it\u2019s a sentence in SL, we do know that\nthere are only two possibilities for its truth-value: true or false (T or F). So in the first column, we list\nthose two possibilities. In the second column, we have \u2018~ p\u2019, the negation of whatever \u2018p\u2019 is. We can\ncompute the truth-value of the negation based on the truth-value of the sentence being negated: if the\noriginal sentence is true, then its negation is false; if the original sentence is false, then the negation is\ntrue. This is what we represent when we write \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018T\u2019 underneath the tilde (the operator that effects\nthe change in truth-value) in the second column, in the same rows as their opposites.\nTilde is a truth-functional operator. Its meaning is specified by a function: if you input a T, the output is\nan F; if you input an F, the output is a T. The other four operators will also be defined in terms of the\ntruth-function they represent. This is exactly analogous, again, to arithmetic. Addition, with its operator\n\u2018+\u2019, is a function on numbers. Input 1 and 3, and the output is 4. In SL, we only have two values\u2014T and\nF\u2014but it\u2019s the same kind of thing. We could just as well use numbers to represent the truth-values: 0 for\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 75 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nfalse and 1 for true, for example. In that case, tilde would be a function that outputs 0 when 1 is the\ninput, and outputs 1 when 0 is the input.\nConjunctions (DOT)\nOur rough-and-ready characterization of conjunctions was that they are \u2018and\u2019-sentences\u2014 sentences like\n\u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical and James Brown is alive\u2019. Since these sorts of compound sentences involve two\nsimpler components, we say that dot is a two-place operator. So when we specify the general form of a\nconjunction using generic variables, we need two of them. The general form of a conjunction in SL is p\n\u2022 q. The questions we need to answer are these: Under what circumstances is the entire conjunction true,\nand under what circumstances false? And how does this depend on the truth-values of the component\nparts?\nWe remarked earlier that when someone utters a conjunction, they\u2019re committing themselves to both of\nthe conjuncts. If I tell you that Beyonc\u00e9 is wise and James Brown is alive, I\u2019m committing myself to the\ntruth of both of those alleged facts; I am, as it were, promising you that both of those things are true. So,\nif even one of them turns out false, I\u2019ve broken my promise; the only way the promise is kept is if both\nof them turn out to be true.\nThis is how conjunctions work, then: they\u2019re true just in case both conjuncts are true; false otherwise.\nWe can represent this graphically, with a truth-table defining the dot:\np q p \u2022 q\nT T T\nT F F\nF T F\nF F F\nSince the dot is a two-place operator, we need columns for each of the two variables in its general\nform\u2014p and q. Each of these is a generic SL sentence that can be either true or false. That gives us four\npossibilities for their truth-values as a pair: both true, p true and q false, p false and q true, both false.\nThese four possibilities give us the four rows of the table. For each of these possible inputs to the truth-\nfunction, we get an output, listed under the dot. T is the output when both inputs are Ts; F is the output\nin every other circumstance.\nDisjunctions (WEDGE)\nOur rough characterization of disjunctions was that they are \u2018or\u2019-sentences\u2014sentences like \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is\nlogical or James Brown is alive\u2019. In SL, the general form of a disjunction is p \u2228 q. We need to figure out\nthe circumstances in which such a compound is true; we need the truth-function represented by the\nwedge.\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 76 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nAt this point we face a complication. Wedge is supposed to capture the essence of \u2018or\u2019 in English, but\nthe word \u2018or\u2019 has two distinct senses. This is one of those cases where natural language needs to be\ntamed: our wedge can only have one meaning, so we need to choose between the two alternative senses\nof the English word \u2018or\u2019.\n\u2018Or\u2019 can be used exclusively or inclusively. The exclusive sense of \u2018or\u2019 is expressed in a sentence like\nthis: \u2018Clinton will win the election or Trump will win the election\u2019. The two disjuncts present exclusive\npossibilities: one or the other will happen, but not both. The inclusive sense of \u2018or\u2019, however, allows the\npossibility of both. If I told you I was having trouble deciding what to order at a restaurant, and said,\n\u201cI\u2019ll order lobster or steak,\u201d and then I ended up deciding to get the surf \u2018n\u2019 turf (lobster and steak\ncombined in the same entr\u00e9e), you wouldn\u2019t say I had lied to you when I said I\u2019d order lobster or steak.\nThe inclusive sense of \u2018or\u2019 allows for one or the other\u2014or both.\nWe will use the inclusive sense of \u2018or\u2019 for our wedge. There are arguments for choosing the inclusive\nsense over the exclusive one, but we will not dwell on those here.3 We need to choose a meaning for\nwedge, and we\u2019re choosing the inclusive sense of \u2018or\u2019. As we will see later, the exclusive sense will not\nbe lost to us because of this choice: we will be able to symbolize exclusive \u2018or\u2019 within SL, using a\ncombination of operators.\nSo, wedge is inclusive \u2018or\u2019. It\u2019s true whenever one or the other\u2014or both\u2014conjuncts is true; false\notherwise. This is its truth-table definition:\np q p \u2228 q\nT T T\nT F T\nF T T\nF F F\nBiconditionals (TRIPLE-BAR)\nAs we said, biconditionals are, roughly, \u2018if and only if\u2019-sentences\u2014sentences like \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 is logical if\nand only if James Brown is alive\u2019. \u2018If and only if\u2019 is not a phrase most people use in everyday life, but\nthe meaning is straightforward: it\u2019s used to claim that both components have the same truth-value, that\none entails the other and vice versa, that they can\u2019t have different truthvalues. In SL, the general form of\na biconditional is p \u2261 q. This is the truth-function:\n3 As was the case when we had to make a choice about the word \u2018some\u2019 in Aristotelian logic, the argument makes the case\nthat the inclusive sense is the core meaning of \u2018or\u2019, and the exclusive sense is a meaning that\u2019s often, but not always,\nconveyed when we use \u2018or\u2019 in particular circumstances\u2014an implicature. This line of reasoning has both adherents and\ndetractors.\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 77 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\np q p \u2261 q\nT T T\nT F F\nF T F\nF F T\nThe triple-bar is kind of like a logical equals-sign (it even resembles \u2018=\u2019): the function delivers an output\nof T when both components are the same, F when they\u2019re not.\nWhile the truth-functional meaning of triple-bar is now clear, it still may be the case that the intuitive\nmeaning of the English phrase \u2018if and only if\u2019 remains elusive. This is natural. Fear not: we will have\nmuch more to say about that locution when we discuss translating between English and SL; a full\nunderstanding of biconditionals can only be achieved based on a full understanding of conditionals, to\nwhich, as the names suggest, they are closely related. We now turn to a specification of the truth-\nfunctional meaning of the latter.\nConditionals (HORSESHOE)\nOur rough characterization of conditionals was that they are \u2018if/then\u2019 sentences\u2014sentences like \u2018If\nBeyonc\u00e9 is logical, then James Brown is alive\u2019. We use such sentences all the time in everyday speech,\nbut is surprisingly difficult to pin down the precise meaning of the conditional, especially within the\nconstraints imposed by SL. There are in fact many competing accounts of the conditional\u2014many\ndifferent conditionals to choose from\u2014in a literature dating back all the way to the Stoics of ancient\nGreece. Whole books can be\u2014and have been\u2014written on the topic of conditionals. In the course of our\ndiscussion of the semantics for horseshoe, we will get a sense of why this is such a vexed topic; it\u2019s\ncomplicated.\nThe general form of a conditional in SL is p \u2283 q. We need to decide for which values of p and q the\nconditional turns out true and false. To help us along (by making things more vivid), we\u2019ll consider an\nactual conditional claim, with a little story to go along with it. Suppose Barb is suffering from joint pain;\nmaybe it\u2019s gout, maybe it\u2019s arthritis\u2014she doesn\u2019t know and hasn\u2019t been to the doctor to find out. She\u2019s\ncomplaining about her pain to her neighbor, Sally. Sally is a big believer in \u201calternative medicine\u201d and\n\u201cholistic healing\u201d. After hearing a brief description of the symptoms, Sally is ready with a prescription,\nwhich she delivers to Barb in the form of a conditional claim: \u201cIf you drink this herbal tea every day for\na week, then your pain will go away.\u201d She hands over a packet of tea leaves and instructs Barb in their\nproper preparation.\nWe want to evaluate Sally\u2019s conditional claim\u2014that if Barb drinks the herbal tea daily for a week, then\nher pain will go away\u2014for truth/falsity. To do so, we will consider various scenarios, the details of\nwhich will bear on that evaluation.\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 78 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nScenario #1: Barb does in fact drink the tea every day for a week as prescribed, and, after doing so, lo\nand behold, her pain is gone. Sally was right! In this scenario, we would say that the conditional we\u2019re\nevaluating is true.\nScenario #2: Barb does as Sally said and drinks the tea every day for a week, but, after the week is\nfinished, the pain remains, the same as ever. In this scenario, we would say that Sally was wrong: her\nconditional advice was false.\nPerhaps you can see what I\u2019m doing here. Each of the scenarios represents one of the rows in the truth-\ntable definition for the horseshoe. Sally\u2019s conditional claim has an antecedent\u2014Barb drinks the tea\nevery day for a week\u2014and a consequent\u2014Barb\u2019s pain goes away. These are p and q, respectively, in the\nconditional p \u2283 q. In scenario #1, both p and q were true: Barb did drink the tea, and the pain did go\naway; in scenario #2, p was true (Barb drank the tea) but q was false (the pain didn\u2019t go away). These\ntwo scenarios are the first two rows of the four-row truth tables we\u2019ve already seen for dot, wedge, and\ntriple-bar. For horseshoe, the truth-function gives us T in the first row and F in the second:\np q p \u2283 q\nT T T\nT F F\nAll that\u2019s left is to figure out what happens in the third and fourth rows of the table, where the\nantecedent (p, Barb drinks the tea) is false both times and the consequent is first true (in row 3) and then\nfalse (in row 4). There are two more scenarios to consider.\nIn scenario #3, Barb decides Sally is a bit of a nut, or she drinks the tea once and it tastes awful so she\ndecides to stop drinking it\u2014whatever the circumstances, Barb doesn\u2019t drink the tea for a week; the\nantecedent is false. But in this scenario, it turns out that after the week is up, Barb\u2019s pain has gone away;\nthe consequent is true. What do we say about Sally\u2019s advice\u2014if you drink the tea, the pain will go\naway\u2014in this set of circumstances?\nIn scenario #4, again Barb does not drink the tea (false antecedent), and after the week is up, the pain\nremains (false consequent). What do we say about the Sally\u2019s conditional advice in this scenario?\nIt\u2019s tempting to say that in the 3rd and 4th scenarios, since Barb didn\u2019t even try Sally\u2019s remedy, we\u2019re not\nin a position to evaluate Sally\u2019s advice for truth or falsity. The hypothesis wasn\u2019t even tested. So, we\u2019re\ninclined to say \u2018If you drink the tea, then the pain will go away\u2019 is neither true nor false. But while this\nmight be a viable option in English, it won\u2019t work in SL. We\u2019ve made the simplifying assumptions that\nevery SL sentence must have a truth-value, and that that the only two possibilities are true and false. We\ncan\u2019t say it has no truth-value; we can\u2019t add a third value and call it \u201cneither\u201d. We have to put a T or an\nF under the horseshoe in the third and fourth rows of the truth table for that operator. Given this\nrestriction, and given that we\u2019ve already decided how the first two rows should work out, there are four\npossible ways of specifying the truth-function for horseshoe:\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 79 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\np q (1) (2) (3) (4)\nT T T T T T\nT F F F F F\nF T F T F T\nF F F F T T\nThese are our only options (remember, the top two rows are settled; scenarios 1 and 2 above had clear\nresults). Which one captures the meaning of the conditional best?\nOption 1 is tempting: as we noted, in rows 3 and 4, Sally\u2019s hypothesis isn\u2019t even tested. If we\u2019re forced\nto choose between true and false, we might as well go with false. The problem with this option is that\nthis truth-function\u2014true when both components are true; false otherwise\u2014is already taken. That\u2019s the\nmeaning of dot. If we choose option 1, we make horseshoe and dot mean the same thing. That won\u2019t do:\nthey\u2019re different operators; they should have different meanings. \u2018And\u2019 and \u2018if/then\u2019 don\u2019t mean the\nsame thing in English, clearly.\nOption 2 also has its charms. OK, we might say, in neither situation is Sally\u2019s hypothesis tested, but at\nleast row 3 has something going for it, Sally-wise: the pain does go away. So let\u2019s say her conditional is\ntrue in that case, but false in row 4 when there still is pain. Again, this won\u2019t do. Compare the column\nunder option 2 to the column under q. They\u2019re the same: T, F, T, F. That means the entire conditional, p\n\u2283 q, has the same meaning as its consequent, plain old q. Not good. The antecedent, p, makes no\ndifference to the truth-value of the conditional in this case. But it should; we shouldn\u2019t be able to\ncompute the truth-value of a two-place function without even looking at one of the inputs.\nOption 3 is next. Some people find it reasonable to say that the conditional is false in row 3: there\u2019s\nsomething about the disappearance of the pain, despite not drinking the tea, that\u2019s incompatible with\nSally\u2019s prediction. And if we can\u2019t put an F in the last row too (this is just option 1 again), then make it a\nT. But this fails for the same reason option 1 did: the truth-function is already taken, this time by the\ntriple-bar. \u2018If and only if\u2019 is a much stronger claim than the mere \u2018if/then\u2019; biconditionals must have a\ndifferent meaning from mere conditionals.\nThat leaves option 4. This is the one we\u2019ll adopt, not least because it\u2019s the only possibility left. The\nconditional is true when both antecedent and consequent are true\u2014scenario 1; it\u2019s false when the\nantecedent is true but the consequent false\u2014scenario 2; and it\u2019s true whenever the antecedent is false\u2014\nscenarios 3 and 4. This is the definition of horseshoe:\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 80 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\np q p \u2283q\nT T T\nT F F\nF T T\nF F T\nIt\u2019s not ideal. The first two rows are quite plausible, but there\u2019s something profoundly weird about\nsaying that the sentence \u2018If you drink the tea, then the pain will go away\u2019 is true whenever the tea is not\ndrunk. Yet that is our only option. We can perhaps make it a bit more palatable by saying\u2014 as we did\nabout universal categorical propositions with empty subject classes\u2014that while it\u2019s true in such cases,\nit\u2019s only true vacuously or trivially\u2014true in a way that doesn\u2019t tell you about how things are in the\nworld.\nWhat can also help a little is to point out that while rows 3 and 4 don\u2019t make much sense for the\nBarb/Sally case, they do work for other conditionals. The horror author Stephen King lives in Maine\n(half his books are set there, it seems). Consider this conditional: \u2018If Stephen King is the Governor of\nMaine, then he lives in Maine\u2019. While a prominent citizen, King is not Maine\u2019s governor, so the\nantecedent is false. He is, though, as we\u2019ve noted, a resident of Maine, so the consequent is true. We\u2019re\nin row 3 of the truth-table for conditionals here. And intuitively, the conditional is true: he\u2019s not the\ngovernor, but if he were, he would live in Maine (governors reside in their states\u2019 capitals). And consider\nthis conditional: \u2018If Stephen King is president of the United States, then he lives in Washington, DC\u2019.\nNow both the antecedent (King is president) and the consequent (he lives in DC) are false: we\u2019re in row\n4 of the table. But yet again, the conditional claim is intuitively true: if he were president, he would live\nin DC.\nNotice the trick I pulled there: I switched from the so-called indicative mood (if he is) to the subjunctive\n(if he were). The truth of the conditional is clearer in the latter mood than the former. But this trick\nwon\u2019t always work to make the conditional come out true in the third and fourth rows. Consider: \u2018If\nStephen King were president of the United States, then he would live in Maine\u2019 and \u2018If Stephen King\nwere Governor of Maine, then he would live in Washington, DC\u2019. These are third and fourth row\nexamples, respectively, but neither is intuitively true.\nBy now perhaps you are getting a sense of why conditionals are such a vexed topic in the history of\nlogic. A variety of approaches, with attendant alternative logical formalisms, have been developed over\nthe centuries (and especially in the last century) to deal with the various problems that arise in\nconnection with conditional claims. Ours is the very simplest approach, the one with which to begin. As\nthis is an introductory text, this is appropriate. You can investigate alternative accounts of the\nconditional if you extend your study of logic further.\nComputing Truth-Values of Compound SL Sentences\nWith the truth-functional definitions of the five SL operators in hand, we can develop a preliminary skill\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 81 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nthat will be necessary to deploy when the time comes to test SL arguments for validity. We need to be\nable to compute the truth-values of compound SL sentences, given the truth-values of their simplest\nparts (the simple sentences\u2014capital letters). To do so, we must first determine what type of compound\nsentence we\u2019re dealing with\u2014negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, or biconditional. This\ninvolves deciding which of the operators in the SL sentence is the main operator. We then compute the\ntruth-value of the compound according to the definition for the appropriate operator, using the truth-\nvalues of the simpler components. If these components are themselves compound, we determine their\nmain operators and compute accordingly, in terms of their simpler components\u2014repeating as necessary\nuntil we get down to the simplest components of all, the capital letters. A few examples will make the\nprocess clear.\nLet\u2019s suppose that A and B are true SL sentences. Consider this compound:\n~ A \u2228 B\nWhat is its truth-value? To answer that question, we first have to figure out what kind of compound\nsentence we\u2019re dealing with. It has two operators\u2014the tilde and the wedge. Which of these is the main\noperator; that is, do we have a negation or a disjunction? We answered this question earlier, when we\nwere discussing the syntax of SL. Our convention with tildes is that they negate the first well-formed\nconstruction immediately to their right. In this case, \u2018A\u2019 is the first well-formed construction\nimmediately to the right of the tilde, so the tilde negates it. That means wedge is the main operator; this\nis a disjunction, where the left-hand disjunct is ~ A and the right-hand disjunct is B. To compute the\ntruth-value of the disjunction, we need to know the truth-values of its disjuncts. We know that B is true;\nwe need to know the truth-value of ~ A. That\u2019s easy, since A is true, ~ A must be false. It\u2019s helpful to\nkeep track of one\u2019s step-by-step computations like so:\nT T\n~ A \u2228 B\nF\nI\u2019ve marked the truth-values of the simplest components, A and B, on top of those letters. Then, under\nthe tilde, the operator that makes it happen, I write \u2018F\u2019 to indicate that the left-hand disjunct, ~ A, is\nfalse. Now I can compute the truth-value of the disjunction: the left-hand disjunct is false, but the right\nhand disjunct is true; this is row 3 of the wedge truth-table, and the disjunction turns out true in that\ncase. I indicate this with a \u2018T\u2019 under the wedge, which I highlight (with boldface and underlining) to\nemphasize the fact that this is the truth-value of the whole compound sentence:\nT T\n~ A \u2228 B\nF\nT\nWhen we were discussing syntax, we claimed that adding parentheses to a compound like the last one\nwould alter its meaning. We\u2019re now in a position to prove that claim. Consider this SL sentence (where\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 82 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nA and B are again assumed to be true):\nT T\n~ (A \u2228 B)\nNow the main operator is the tilde: it negates the entire disjunction inside the parentheses. To discover\nthe effect of that negation on truth-value, we need to compute the truth-value of the disjunction that it\nnegates. Both A and B are true; this is the top row of the wedge truth-table\u2014 disjunctions turn out true\nin such cases:\nT T\n~ (A \u2228 B)\nT\nSo the tilde is negating a truth, giving us a falsehood:\nT T\n~ (A \u2228 B)\nT\nF\nThe truth-value of the whole is false; the similar-looking disjunction without the parentheses was true.\nThese two SL sentences must have different meanings; they have different truth-values. It will perhaps\nbe useful to look at one more example, this time of a more complex SL sentence. Suppose again that A\nand B are true SL simple sentences, and that X and Y are false SL simple sentences. Let\u2019s compute the\ntruth-value of the following compound sentence:\n~ (A \u2022 X) \u2283 (B \u2228 ~ Y)\nAs a first step, it\u2019s useful to mark the truth-values of the simple sentences:\nT F T F\n~ (A \u2022 X) \u2283 (B \u2228 ~ Y)\nNow, we need to figure out what kind of compound sentence this is; what is the main operator? This\nsentence is a conditional; the main operator is the horseshoe. The tilde at the far left negates the first\nwell-formed construction immediately to its right. In this case, that is (A \u2022 X). ~ (A \u2022 X) is the\nantecedent of this conditional; (B \u2228 ~ Y) is the consequent. We need to compute the truthvalues of each\nof these before we can compute the truth-value of the whole compound.\nLet\u2019s take the antecedent, ~ (A \u2022 X) first. The tilde negates the conjunction, so before we can know what\nthe tilde does, we need to know the truth-value of the conjunction inside the parentheses. Conjunctions\nare true just in case both conjuncts are true; in this case, A is true but X is false, so the conjunction is\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 83 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nfalse, and its negation must be true:\nT F T F\n~ (A \u2022 X) \u2283 (B \u2228 ~ Y)\nF\nT\nSo the antecedent of our conditional is true. Let\u2019s look at the consequent, (B \u2228 ~ Y). Y is false, so ~ Y\nmust be true. That means both disjuncts, B and ~ Y are true, making our disjunction true:\nT F T F\n~ (A \u2022 X) \u2283 (B \u2228 ~ Y)\nF T\nT T\nBoth the antecedent and consequent of the conditional are true, so the whole conditional is true:\nT F T F\n~ (A \u2022 X) \u2283 (B \u2228 ~ Y)\nF T\nT T\nT\nOne final note: sometimes you only need partial information to make a judgment about the truthvalue of\na compound sentence. Look again at the truth table definitions of the two-place operators:\np q p \u2022 q p \u2228 q p \u2261 q p \u2283 q\nT T T T T T\nT F F T F F\nF T F T F T\nF F F F T T\nFor three of these operators\u2014the dot, wedge, and horseshoe\u2014one of the rows is not like the others. For\nthe dot: it only comes out true when both p and q are true, in the top row. For the wedge: it only comes\nout false when both p and q are false, in the bottom row. For the horseshoe: it only comes out false when\np is true and q is false, in the second row.\nNoticing this allows us, in some cases, to compute truth-values of compounds without knowing the\ntruth-values of both components. Suppose again that A is true and X is false; and let Q be a simple SL\nsentence the truth-value of which is a mystery to you (it has one, like all of them must; I\u2019m just not\ntelling you what it is). Consider this compound:\n14 Semantics of Sentential Logic 84 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nA \u2228 Q\nWe know one of the disjuncts is true; we don\u2019t know the truth-value of the other one. But we don\u2019t need\nto! A disjunction is only false when both of its disjuncts are false; it\u2019s true when even one of its disjuncts\nis true. A being true is enough to tell us the disjunction is true; Q doesn\u2019t matter.\nConsider the conjunction:\nX \u2022 Q\nWe only know the truth-value of one of the conjuncts: X is false. That\u2019s all we need to know to compute\nthe truth-value of the conjunction. Conjunctions are only true when both of their conjuncts are true;\nthey\u2019re false when even one of them is false. X being false is enough to tell us that this conjunction is\nfalse.\nFinally, consider these conditionals:\nQ \u2283 A and X \u2283 Q\nThey are both true. Conditionals are only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false;\nso they\u2019re true whenever the consequent is true (as is the case in Q \u2283 A) and whenever the antecedent is\nfalse (as is the case in X \u2283 Q).\nEXERCISES\nCompute the truth-values of the following compound sentences, where A, B, and C are true; X, Y, and Z\nare false; and P and Q are of unknown truth-value.\n1. ~ B \u2228 X 2.

In real life, though, we\u2019re not interested in evaluating arguments in some artificial\nlanguage; we\u2019re interested in evaluating arguments presented in natural languages like English. So in\norder for our evaluative procedure of SL argument to have any real-world significance, we need to show\nhow SL arguments can be fair representations of natural-language counterparts. We need to show how to\ntranslate sentences in English into SL.\nWe already have some hints about how this is done. We know that simple English sentences are\nrepresented as capital letters in SL. We know that our operators\u2014tilde, dot, wedge, horseshoe, and\ntriple-bar\u2014are the SL counterparts of the English locutions \u2018not\u2019, \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, \u2018if/then\u2019, and \u2018if and only\nif\u2019, respectively. But there is significantly more to say on the topic of the relationship between English\nand SL. Our operators\u2014alone or in combination\u2014can capture a much larger portion of English than that\nshort list of words and phrases.\nTilde, Dot, and Wedge\nConsider the word \u2018but\u2019. In English, it has a different meaning from the word \u2018and\u2019. When I say \u201cDonald\nTrump is rich and generous,\u201d I communicate one thing; when I say \u201cDonald Trump is rich, but\ngenerous,\u201d I communicate something slightly different. Both utterances convey the assertions that\nTrump is rich, on the one hand, and generous on the other. The \u2018but\u2019-sentence, though, conveys\nsomething more\u2014namely, that there\u2019s something surprising about the generosity in light of the richness,\nthat there\u2019s some tension between the two. But notice that each of those utterances is true under the same\ncircumstances: when Trump is both rich and generous; the difference between \u2018but\u2019 and \u2018and\u2019 doesn\u2019t\naffect the truth-conditions. Since the meanings of our SL operators are specified entirely in terms of their\neffects on truth-values, SL is blind to the difference in meaning between \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018but\u2019. Since the truth-\nconditions for compounds featuring the two words are the same\u2014true just in case both components are\ntrue, and false otherwise\u2014we can use the dot to represent both. \u2018Donald Trump is rich and generous\u2019\nand \u2018Donald Trump is rich, but generous\u2019 would both be rendered in SL as something like \u2018R \u2022 G\u2019\n(where \u2018R\u2019 stands for the simple sentence \u2018Trump is rich\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 stands for \u2018Trump is generous\u2019).\nAgain, switching from English into SL is a strategy for dealing with the messiness of natural language:\nto conduct the kind of rigorous logical analyses involved in evaluating deductive arguments, we need a\nsimpler, tamer language; the slight difference in meaning between \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018but\u2019 is one of the wrinkles\nwe need to iron out before we can proceed.\nThere are other words and phrases that have the same effect on truth-value as \u2018and\u2019, and which can\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n15 Translating from English to Sentential Logic 86 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\ntherefore be represented with the dot: \u2018although\u2019, \u2018however\u2019, \u2018moreover\u2019, \u2018in addition\u2019, and so on. These\ncan all be used to form conjunctions.\nThere are fewer ways of forming disjunctions in English. Almost always, these feature the word \u2018or\u2019,\nsometimes accompanied by \u2018either\u2019. Whenever we see \u2018or\u2019, we will translate it into SL as the wedge. As\nwe discussed, the wedge captures the inclusive sense of \u2018or\u2019\u2014one or the other, or both. The exclusive\nsense\u2014one or the other, but not both\u2014can also be rendered in SL, using a combination of symbols.\n\u2018Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will win the election, but not both\u2019. How would we translate that into\nSL? Let \u2018H\u2019 stand for \u2018Hillary Clinton will win\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 stand for \u2018Donald Trump will win\u2019. We know\nhow to deal with the \u2018or\u2019 part: \u2018Hillary Clinton will win or Donald Trump will win\u2019 is just \u2018H \u2228 D\u2019.\nHow about the \u2018not both\u2019 part? That\u2019s the claim, paraphrasing slightly, that it\u2019s not the case that both\nHillary and Trump will win; that is, it\u2019s the negation of the conjunction: \u2018~ (H \u2022 D)\u2019. So we have the \u2018or\u2019\npart, and we have the \u2018not both\u2019 part; the only thing left is the word \u2018but\u2019 in between. We just learned\nhow to deal with that! \u2018But\u2019 gets translated as a dot. So the proper SL translation of \u2018Hillary Clinton or\nDonald Trump will win the election, but not both\u2019 is this:\n(H \u2228 D) \u2022 ~ (H \u2022 D)\nNotice we had to enclose the disjunction, \u2018H \u2228 D\u2019, in parentheses. This is to remove ambiguity: without\nthe parentheses, we wouldn\u2019t know whether the wedge or the (middle) dot was the main operator, and so\nthe construction would not have been well-formed. In SL, the exclusive sense of \u2018or\u2019 is expressed with a\nconjunction: it conjoins the (inclusive) \u2018or\u2019 claim to the \u2018not both\u2019 claim\u2014 one or the other, but not both.\nIt is worth pausing to reflect on the symbolization of \u2018not both\u2019, and comparing it to a complementary\nlocution\u2014\u2018neither/nor\u2019. We symbolize \u2018not both\u2019 in SL as a negated conjunction; \u2018neither/nor\u2019 is a\nnegated disjunction. The sentence \u2018Neither Donald Trump nor Beyonc\u00e9 will win the election\u2019 would be\nrendered as \u2018~ (D \u2228 B)\u2019; that is, it\u2019s not the case that either Donald or Beyonc\u00e9 will win.\nWhen we discussed the syntax of SL, it was useful to use and analogy to arithmetic to understand the\ninteractions between tildes and parentheses. Taking that analogy too far in the case of negated\nconjunctions and disjunctions can lead us into error. The following is true in arithmetic:\n- (2 + 5) = -2 + -5\nWe can distribute the minus-sign inside the parentheses (it\u2019s just multiplying by -1). The following,\nhowever, are not true in logic2:\n~ (p \u2022 q) \u2261 ~ p \u2022 ~ q [WRONG]\n~ (p \u2228 q) \u2261 ~ p \u2228 ~ q [WRONG]\n2 The triple-bar is a logical equals-sign; it indicates that the components have the same truth-conditions (meaning). 10 They\u2019re\noften referred to as \u201cDeMorgan\u2019s Laws,\u201d after the nineteenth century English logician Augustus DeMorgan, who was\napparently the first to formulate in the terms of the modern formal system developed by his fellow countryman and\ncontemporary, George Boole. DeMorgan didn\u2019t discover these equivalences, however. They have been known to logicians\nsince the ancient Greeks.\n15 Translating from English to Sentential Logic 87 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nThe tilde cannot be distributed inside the parentheses in these cases. For each, the left- and righthand\ncomponents have different meanings. To see why, we should think about some concrete examples. Let\n\u2018R\u2019 stand for \u2018Donald Trump is rich\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 stand for \u2018Donald Trump is generous\u2019. \u2018~ (R \u2022 G)\u2019\nsymbolizes the claim that Trump is not both rich and generous. Notice that this claim is compatible with\nhis actually being rich, but not generous, and also with his being generous, but not rich. The claim is just\nthat he\u2019s not both. Now consider the claim that \u2018~ R \u2022 ~ G\u2019 symbolizes. The main operator in that\nsentence is the dot; it\u2019s a conjunction. Conjunctions make a commitment to the truth of each of their\nconjuncts. The conjuncts in this case symbolize the sentences \u2018Trump is not rich\u2019 and \u2018Trump is not\ngenerous\u2019. That is, this conjunction is committed to Trump\u2019s lacking both richness and generosity. That\nis a stronger claim than saying he\u2019s not both: if you say he\u2019s not both, that\u2019s compatible with him being\none or the other; \u2018~ R \u2022 ~ G\u2019, on the other hand, insists that both are ruled out. So, generally speaking, a\nnegated conjunction makes a different (weaker) claim than the conjunction of two negations.\nThere is also a difference between a negated disjunction and the disjunction of two negations. Consider\n\u2018~ (R \u2228 G)\u2019. That symbolizes the sentence \u2018Trump is neither rich nor generous\u2019. In other words, he lacks\nboth richness and generosity. That\u2019s a much stronger claim that the one symbolized by \u2018~ R \u2228 ~ G\u2019\u2014\nthe disjunction \u2018Either Trump isn\u2019t rich or he isn\u2019t generous\u2019. He lacks one or the other quality (or both;\nthe disjunction is inclusive). That\u2019s compatible with his actually being rich, but not generous; it\u2019s also\ncompatible with his being generous, but not rich.\nDid you notice what happened there? I used the same language to describe the claim symbolized by \u2018~\n(R \u2022 G)\u2019 and \u2018~ R \u2228 ~ G\u2019. Both merely assert that he isn\u2019t both rich and generous; he may be one or the\nother. I also described the claims made by \u2018~ (R \u2228 G)\u2019 and \u2018~ R \u2022 ~ G\u2019 the same way. Both make the\nstronger claim that he lacks both characteristics. This is true in general: negated conjunctions are\nequivalent to the disjunction of two negations; and negated disjunctions are equivalent to the\nconjunction of two negations. The following logical equivalences are true10:\n~ (p \u2022 q) \u2261 ~ p \u2228 ~ q\n~ (p \u2228 q) \u2261 ~ p \u2022 ~ q\nIf you want to distribute that tilde inside the parentheses (or, alternatively, moving from right to left, pull\nthe tilde outside), you have to change the wedge to a dot (and vice versa).\nHorseshoe and Triple-Bar\nThere are many English locutions that we can symbolize using the horseshoe and the triple-bar\u2014\nespecially the horseshoe. In fact, as we shall see, it\u2019s possible to render claims translated with the triple-\nbar using the horseshoe instead (along with a dot). We will look at a representative sample of the many\nways in which conditionals and biconditionals can be expressed in English, and talk about how to\ntranslate them into SL using the horseshoe and triple-bar.\nThe canonical presentation of a conditional uses the words \u2018if\u2019 and \u2018then\u2019, as in \u2018If the Democrats win\n15 Translating from English to Sentential Logic 88 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nback Congress, then a lot of new legislation will be passed\u2019. But the word \u2018then\u2019 isn\u2019t really necessary:\n\u2018If the Democrats win back Congress, a lot of new legislation will be passed\u2019 makes the same assertion.\nIt would also be symbolized as \u2018D \u2283 L\u2019 (with \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 standing for the obvious simple components).\nThe word \u2018if\u2019 can also be replaced. \u2018Provided the Democrats win back Congress, a lot of new legislation\nwill be passed\u2019 also makes the same claim.\nThings get tricky if we vary the placement of the \u2018if\u2019. Putting it in the middle of sentence, we get \u2018Your\npain will go away if you drink this herbal tea every day for a week\u2019, for example. Compare that sentence\nto the one we considered earlier: \u2018If you drink this herbal tea every day for a week, then your pain will\ngo away\u2019. Read one, then the other. They make the same claim, don\u2019t they? Rule of thumb: whatever\nfollows the word \u2018if\u2019, when \u2018if\u2019 occurs on its own (without the word \u2018only\u2019; see below), is the antecedent\nof the conditional. We would translate both of these sentences as something like \u2018D \u2283 P\u2019 (where \u2018D\u2019 is\nfor drinking the tea, and \u2018P\u2019 is for the pain going away).\nThe word \u2018only\u2019 changes things. Consider: \u2018I will win the lottery only if I have a ticket\u2019. A sensible\nclaim, obviously true. I\u2019m suggesting this is a conditional. Let \u2018W\u2019 stand for \u2018I win the lottery\u2019 and \u2018T\u2019\nstand for \u2018I have a ticket\u2019. Which is the antecedent and which is the consequent? Which of these two\nsymbolizations is correct:\nT \u2283 W\nor\nW \u2283 T\nTo figure it out, let\u2019s read them back into English as canonical \u2018if/then\u2019 claims. The first says, \u201cIf I have\na ticket, then I\u2019ll win the lottery.\u201d Well, that\u2019s optimistic! But clearly false\u2014something only a fool\nwould believe. That can\u2019t be the correct way to symbolize our original, completely sensible claim that I\nwill win only if I have a ticket. So it must be the second symbolization, which says that if I did win the\nlottery, then I had a ticket. That\u2019s better. Generally speaking, the component occurring before \u2018only if\u2019 is\nthe antecedent of a conditional, and the component occurring after is the consequent.\nThe claim in the last example can be put differently: having a ticket is a necessary condition for winning\nthe lottery. We use the language of \u201cnecessary and sufficient conditions\u201d all the time. We symbolize\nthese locutions with the horseshoe. For example, being at least 16 years old is a necessary condition for\nhaving a driver\u2019s license (in most states). Let \u2018O\u2019 stand for \u2018I am at least 16 years old\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 stand for\n\u2018I have a driver\u2019s license. \u2018D \u2283 O\u2019 symbolizes the sentence claiming that O is necessary for D. The\nopposite won\u2019t work: \u2018O \u2283 D\u2019, if we read it back, says \u201cIf I\u2019m at least 16 years old, then I have a\ndriver\u2019s license.\u201d But that\u2019s not true. Plenty of 16-year-olds don\u2019t get a license. There are additional\nconditions besides age: passing the test, being physically able to drive, etc.\nAnother way of putting that point: being at least 16 years old is not a sufficient condition for having a\ndriver\u2019s license; it\u2019s not enough on its own. An example of a sufficient condition: getting 100% on every\ntest is a sufficient condition for getting an A in a class (supposing tests are the only evaluations). That is,\n15 Translating from English to Sentential Logic 89 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nif you get 100% on every test, then you\u2019ll get an A. If \u2018H\u2019 stands for \u2018I got 100% on all the tests\u2019 and \u2018A\u2019\nstands for \u2018I got an A in the class\u2019, then we would indicate that H is a sufficient condition for A in SL by\nwriting \u2018H \u2283 A\u2019. Notice that it\u2019s not a necessary condition: you don\u2019t have to be perfect to get an A. \u2018A\n\u2283 H\u2019 would symbolize a falsehood.\nTo define a concept is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for falling under it. For example, a\nbachelor is, by definition, an unmarried male. That is, being an unmarried male is necessary and\nsufficient for being a bachelor: you don\u2019t qualify as a bachelor is you\u2019re not an unmarried male, and\nbeing an unmarried male is enough, on its own, to qualify for bachelorhood. It\u2019s for circumstances like\nthis that we have the triple-bar. Recall, the phrase that triple-bar is meant to capture the meaning of is \u2018if\nand only if\u2019. We\u2019re now in a position to understand that locution. Consider the claim that I am a bachelor\nif and only if I am an unmarried male. This is really a conjunction of two claims: I am a bachelor if I\u2019m\nan unmarried male, and I\u2019m a bachelor only if I\u2019m an unmarried male. Let \u2018B\u2019 stand for \u2018I\u2019m a bachelor\u2019\nand \u2018U\u2019 stand for \u2018I\u2019m an unmarried male. Our claim is then B if U, and B only if U. We know how to\ndeal with \u2018if\u2019 on its own between two sentences: the one after the \u2018if\u2019 is the antecedent of the\nconditional. And we know how to deal with \u2018only if\u2019: the sentence before it is the antecedent, and the\nsentence after it is the consequent. To symbolize \u2018I am a bachelor if and only if I am an unmarried male\u2019\nusing horseshoes and a dot, we get this:\n(U \u2283 B) \u2022 (B \u2283 U)\nThe left-hand conjunct is the \u2018if\u2019 part; the right-hand conjunct is the \u2018only if\u2019 part. The purpose of the\ntriple-bar is to give us a way of symbolizing such claims more easily, with a single symbol. \u2018I am a\nbachelor if and only if I am an unmarried male\u2019 can be translated into SL as \u2018B \u2261 L\u2019, which is just\nshorthand for the longer conjunction of conditionals above. And given that \u2018necessary and sufficient\u2019 is\nalso just a conjunction of two conditionals, we use triple-bar for that locution as well. (Also, the phrase\n\u2018just in case\u2019 can be used to express a biconditional claim.)\nAt this point, you may have an objection: why include triple-bar in SL at all, if it\u2019s dispensable in favor\nof a dot and a couple of horseshoes? Isn\u2019t it superfluous? Well, yes and no. We could do without it, but\nhaving it makes certain translations easier. As a matter of fact, this is the case for all of our symbols. It\u2019s\nalways possible to replace them with combinations of others. Consider the horseshoe. It\u2019s false when the\nantecedent is true and the consequent false, true otherwise. So really, it\u2019s just a claim that it\u2019s not the\ncase that the antecedent is true and the conclusion false\u2014a negated conjunction. We could replace any p\n\u2283 q with ~ (p \u2022 ~ q). And the equivalences we saw earlier\u2014 DeMorgan\u2019s Laws\u2014show us how we can\nreplace dots with wedges and vice versa. It\u2019s a fact (I won\u2019t prove it; take my word for it) that we could\nget by with only two symbols in our language: tilde and any one of wedge, dot, or horseshoe.3 So yeah,\nwe have more symbols than we need, strictly speaking. But it\u2019s convenient to have the number of\nsymbols that we do, since they line up neatly with English locutions, making translation between\nEnglish and SL much easier than it would be otherwise.\n3 In fact, it\u2019s possible to get by with only one symbol: if we defined a new two-place operator that\u2019s true when both\ncomponents are false, and false otherwise, that would do the trick. The symbol typically used for this truth-function is \u2018|\u2019,\ncalled the \u201cSheffer stroke\u201d after the logician (Henry Sheffer) who first published this result.\n15 Translating from English to Sentential Logic 90 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nEXERCISES\nTranslate the following into SL, using the bolded capital letters to stand for simple sentences.\n1.

The\ntest will involve applying skills that we\u2019ve already learned: setting up truth tables and computing the\ntruth-values of compounds. First, we must define logical form in SL.\nLogical Form in SL\nThis will seem trivial, but it is necessary. We\u2019re learning how to evaluate arguments expressed in SL.\nLike any evaluation of deductive arguments, the outcome hinges on the argument\u2019s form. So what is the\nform of an SL argument? Let\u2019s consider an example; here is an argument in SL:\nA \u2283 B\n~ B\n/\u2234 ~ A\n\u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 stand for simple sentences in English; we don\u2019t care which ones. We\u2019re working within SL:\ngiven an argument in this language, how do we determine its form? Quite simply, by systematically\nreplacing capital letters with variables (lower-case letters like \u2018p\u2019, \u2018q\u2019, and \u2018r\u2019). The form of that\nparticular SL argument is this:\np \u2283 q\n~ q\n/\u2234 ~ p\nThe replacement of capital letters with lower-case variables was systematic in this sense: each\noccurrence of the same capital letter (e.g., \u2018A\u2019) was replaced with the same variable (e.g., \u2018p\u2019).\nTo generate the logical form of an SL argument, what we do is systematically replace SL sentences with\nwhat we\u2019ll call sentence-forms. An SL sentence is just a well-formed combination of SL symbols\u2014\ncapital letters, operators, and parentheses. A sentence-form is a combination of symbols that would be\nwell-formed in SL, except that it has lower-case variables instead of capital letters.\nAgain, this may seem like a trivial change, but it is necessary. Remember, when we\u2019re testing an\nargument for validity, we\u2019re checking to see whether its form is such that it\u2019s possible for its premises to\nturn out true and its conclusion false. This means checking various ways of filling in the form with\nparticular sentences. Variables\u2014as the name suggests\u2014can vary in the way we need: they are generic\nand can be replaced with any old particular sentence. Actual SL constructions feature capital letters,\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 93 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nwhich are actual sentences having specific truth-values. It is conceptually incoherent to speak of\nchecking different possibilities for actual sentences. So we must switch to sentence-forms.\nThe Truth Table Test for Validity\nTo test an SL argument for validity, we identify its logical form, then create a truth table with columns\nfor each of the variables and sentence-forms in the argument\u2019s form. Filling in columns of Ts and Fs\nunder each of the operators in those sentence-forms will allow us to check for what we\u2019re looking for: an\ninstance of the argument\u2019s form for which the premises turn out true and the conclusion turns out false.\nFinding such an instance demonstrates the argument\u2019s invalidity, while failing to find one demonstrates\nits validity.\nTo see how this works, it will be useful to work through an example. Consider the following argument in\nEnglish:\nIf Democrats take back Congress, lots of new laws will be passed.\nDemocrats won\u2019t take back Congress.\n/\u2234 Lots of new laws won\u2019t be passed.\nWe\u2019ll evaluate it by first translating it into SL. Let \u2018D\u2019 stand for \u2018Democrats take back Congress\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019\nstand for \u2018Lots of new laws will be passed\u2019. This is the argument in SL:\nD \u2283 L\n~ D\n/\u2234 ~ L\nFirst, the logical form. Replacing \u2018D\u2019 with \u2018p\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 with \u2018q\u2019, we get:\np \u2283 q ~ p /\u2234\n~ q\nNow we set up a truth table, with columns for each of the variables and columns for each of the\nsentence-forms. To determine how many rows our table needs, we note the number of different variables\nthat occur in the argument-form (call that number \u2018n\u2019); the table will need 2n rows. In this case, we have\ntwo variables\u2014\u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019\u2014and so we need 22 = 4 rows. (If there were three variables, we would need\n23 = 8 rows; if there were four, 24 = 16; and so on.) Here is the table we need to fill in for this example:\np q p \u2283 q ~ p ~ q\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 94 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nFirst, we fill in the \u201cbase columns\u201d. These are the columns for the variables. We do this systematically.\nStart with the right-most column (under \u2018q\u2019 in this case), and fill in Ts and Fs alternately: T, F, T, F, T,\nF, \u2026 as many times as you need\u2014until you\u2019ve got a truth-value in every row. That gives us this:\np q p \u2283 q ~ p ~ q\nT\nF\nT\nF\nNext, we move to the base column to the left of the one we just filled in (under \u2018p\u2019 now), and fill in Ts\nand Fs by alternating in twos: T, T, F, F, T, T, F, F,\u2026 as many times as we need. The result is this:\np q p \u2283 q ~ p ~ q\nT T\nT F\nF T\nF F\nIf there were a third base column, we would fill in the Ts and Fs by alternating in fours: T, T, T, T, F, F,\nF, F\u2026. For a fourth base column, we would alternate every other eight. And so on.\nNext, we need to fill in columns of Ts and Fs under each of the operators in the statement-forms\u2019\ncolumns. To do this, we apply our knowledge of how to compute the truth-values of compounds in terms\nof the values of their components, consulting the operators\u2019 truth table definitions. We know how to\ncompute the values of p \u2283 q: it\u2019s false when p is true and q false; true otherwise. We know how to\ncompute the values of ~ p and ~ q: those are just the opposites of the values of p and q in each of the\nrows. Making these computations, we fill the table in thus:\np q p \u2283 q ~ p ~ q\nT T T F F\nT F F F T\nF T T T F\nF F T T T\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 95 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nOnce the table is filled in, we check to see if we have a valid or invalid form. The mark of an invalid\nform is that it\u2019s possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Here, the rows of the table\nare the possibilities\u2014the four possible outcomes of plugging in particular SL sentences for the variables:\nboth true; the first is true, but the second false; the first false but the second true; both false. The reason\nwe systematically fill in the base columns as described above is that the method ensures that our rows\nwill collectively exhaust all these possible combinations.\nSo, to see if it\u2019s possible for the premises to come out true and the conclusion to come out false, we\ncheck each of the rows, looking for one in which this happens\u2014one in which there\u2019s a T under \u2018p \u2283 q\u2019,\na T under \u2018~ p\u2019, and an F under \u2018~ q\u2019. And we have one: in row 3, the premises come out true and the\nconclusion comes out false. This is enough to show that the argument is invalid:\np q p \u2283 q ~ p ~ q\nT T T F F\nT F F F T\nF T T T F\nF F T T T\nINVALID\nWhen we\u2019re checking for validity, we\u2019re looking for one thing, and one thing only: a row (or rows) in\nwhich the premises come out true and the conclusion comes out false. If we find one, we have shown\nthat the argument is invalid. If we don\u2019t find one, that indicates that it\u2019s impossible for the premises to be\ntrue and the conclusion false\u2014and so the argument is valid. Either way, the only thing we look for is a\nrow with true premises and a false conclusion. Every other kind of row is irrelevant. It\u2019s common for\nbeginners to mistakenly think they are. The fourth row in the table above, for example, looks significant.\nEverything comes out true in that row. Doesn\u2019t that mean something\u2014something good, like that the\nargument\u2019s valid? No. Remember, each row represents a possibility; what row 4 shows is that it\u2019s\npossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion true. But that\u2019s not enough for validity. For an\nargument to be valid, the premises must guarantee the conclusion; whenever they\u2019re true, the conclusion\nmust be true. That it\u2019s merely possible that they all come out true is not enough.\nLet\u2019s look at a more involved example, to see how the computation of the truth-values of the statement-\nforms must sometimes proceed in stages. The skill required here is nothing new\u2014it\u2019s just identifying\nmain operators and computing the values of the simplest components first\u2014but it takes careful attention\nto keep everything straight. Consider this SL argument (never mind what its English counterpart is):\n(~ A \u2022 B) \u2228 ~ X\nB \u2283 A\n/\u2234 ~ X\nTo get its form, we replace \u2018A\u2019 with \u2018p\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 with \u2018q\u2019, and \u2018X\u2019 with \u2018r\u2019:\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 96 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n(~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r\nq \u2283 p\n/\u2234 ~ r\nSo our truth-table will look like this (eight rows because we have three variables; 23 = 8):\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nFilling in the base columns as prescribed above\u2014alternating every other one for the column under \u2018r\u2019,\nevery two under \u2018q\u2019, and every four under \u2018p\u2019\u2014we get:\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nT T T\nT T F\nT F T\nT F F\nF T T\nF T F\nF F T\nF F F\nNow we turn our attention to the three sentence-forms. We\u2019ll start with the first premise, the compound\n\u2018(~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r\u2019. We need to compute the truth-value of this formula. We know how to do this, provided\nwe have the truth-values of the simplest parts; we\u2019ve solved problems like that already. The only\ndifference in the case of truth tables is that there are multiple different assignments of truth-values to the\nsimplest parts. In this case, there are eight different ways of assigning truth-values to \u2018p\u2019, \u2018q\u2019, and \u2018r\u2019;\nthose are represented by the eight different rows of the table. So we\u2019re solving a problem we know how\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 97 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nto solve; we\u2019re just doing it eight times.\nWe start by identifying the main operator of the compound formula. In this case, it\u2019s the wedge: we have\na disjunction; the left-hand disjunct is \u2018(~ p \u2022 q)\u2019, and the right-hand disjunct is \u2018~ r\u2019. To figure out what\nhappens under the wedge in our table, we must first figure out the values of these components. Both\ndisjuncts are themselves compound: \u2018(~ p \u2022 q)\u2019 is a conjunction, and \u2018~ r\u2019 is a negation. Let\u2019s tackle the\nconjunction first. To figure out what happens under the dot, we need to know the values of \u2018~ p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019.\nWe know the values of \u2018q\u2019; that\u2019s one of the base columns. We must compute the value of \u2018~ p\u2019. That\u2019s\neasy: in each row, the value of \u2018~ p\u2019 will just be the opposite of the value of \u2018p\u2019. We note the values\nunder the tilde, the operator that generates them:\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nT T T F\nT T F F\nT F T F\nT F F F\nF T T T\nF T F T\nF F T T\nF F F T\nTo compute the value of the conjunction, we consider the result, in each row, of the truth-function for\ndot, where the inputs are the value under the tilde in \u2018~ p\u2019 and the value under \u2018q\u2019 in the base column. In\nrows 1 and 2, it\u2019s F \u2022 T; in rows 3 and 4, F \u2022 F; and so on. The results:\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nT T T F F\nT T F F F\nT F T F F\nT F F F F\nF T T T T\nF T F T T\nF F T T F\nF F F T F\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 98 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nThe column we just produced, under the dot, gives us the range of truth-values for the left-hand disjunct\nin the first premise. We need the values of the right-hand disjunct. That\u2019s just \u2018~ r\u2019, which is easy to\ncompute: it\u2019s just the opposite value of \u2018r\u2019 in every row:\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nT T T F F F\nT T F F F T\nT F T F F F\nT F F F F T\nF T T T T F\nF T F T T T\nF F T T F F\nF F F T F T\nNow we can finally determine the truth-values for the whole disjunction. We compute the value of the\nwedge\u2019s truth-function, where the inputs are the columns under the dot, on the one hand, and the tilde\nfrom \u2018~ r\u2019 on the other. F \u2228 F, F \u2228 T, F \u2228 F, and so on:\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nT T T F F F F\nT T F F F T T\nT F T F F F F\nT F F F F T T\nF T T T T T F\nF T F T T T T\nF F T T F F F\nF F F T F T T\nSince that column represents the range of possible values for the entire sentence-form, we highlight it.\nWhen we test for validity, we\u2019re looking for rows where the premises as a whole come out true; we\u2019ll be\nlooking for the value under their main operators. To make that easier, just so we don\u2019t lose track of\nthings visually because of all those columns, we highlight the one under the main operator.\nNext, the second premise, which is thankfully much less complex. It is, however, slightly tricky. We\nneed to compute the value of a conditional here. But notice that things are a bit different than usual: the\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 99 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nantecedent, \u2018q\u2019, has its base column to the right of the column for the consequent, \u2018p\u2019. That\u2019s a bit\nawkward. We\u2019re used to computing conditionals from left-to-right; we\u2019ll have to mentally adjust to the\nfact that \u2018q \u2283 p\u2019 goes from right-to-left. (Alternatively, if it helps, you can simply reproduce the base\ncolumns underneath the variables in the \u2018q \u2283 p\u2019 column.) So in the first two rows, we compute T \u2283 T;\nbut in rows 3 and 4, it\u2019s F \u2283 T; in rows 5 and 6, it\u2019s T \u2283 F (the only circumstance in which conditionals\nturn out false); an in rows 7 and 8, it\u2019s F \u2283 F. Here is the result:\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nT T T F F F F T\nT T F F F T T T\nT F T F F F F T\nT F F F F T T T\nF T T T T T F F\nF T F T T T T F\nF F T T F F F T\nF F F T F T T T\nNo need to highlight that column, as it\u2019s the only one we produced for that premise, so there can be no\nconfusion.\nWe finish the table by computing the values for the conclusion, which is easy:\np q r (~ p \u2022 q) \u2228 ~ r q \u2283 p ~ r\nT T T F F F F T F\nT T F F F T T T T\nT F T F F F F T F\nT F F F F T T T T\nF T T T T T F F F\nF T F T T T T F T\nF F T T F F F T F\nF F F T F T T T T\nIs the argument valid? We look for a row with true premises and a false conclusion. There are none. The\nonly two rows in which both premises come out true are the second and the eighth, and in both we also\nhave a true conclusion. It is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, so the\nargument is valid.\nSo that is how we test arguments for validity in SL. It\u2019s a straightforward procedure; the main source of\n16 Testing for Validity in Sentential Logic 100 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nerror is simple carelessness. Go step by step, keep careful track of what you\u2019re doing, and it should be\neasy. It\u2019s worth noting that the truth table test is what logicians call a \u201cdecision procedure\u201d: it\u2019s a rule-\ngoverned process (an algorithm) that is guaranteed to answer your question (in this case: valid or\ninvalid?) in a finite number of steps. It is possible to program a computer to run the truth table test on\narbitrarily long SL arguments. This is comforting, since once one gets more than four variables or so, the\nprocess becomes unwieldy.\nEXERCISES\nTest the following arguments for validity. For those that are invalid, specify the row(s) that demonstrate\nthe invalidity.\n1. ~ A, /\u2234 ~ A \u2228 B\n2. A \u2283 B, ~ B, /\u2234 ~ A\n3.

If A is true, then B is true.\n2. B is true.\n3. Therefore, A is true.\nEven if the premise and conclusion are all true, the conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the\npremise. This sort of non sequitur is also called affirming the consequent.\nAn example of affirming the consequent would be:\n1. If Jackson is a human (A), then Jackson is a mammal. (B)\n2. Jackson is a mammal. (B)\n3. Therefore, Jackson is a human. (A)\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise:\n1. Humans are mammals\n2. Jackson is a mammal\n3. Therefore, Jackson is a human\nThe truth of the conclusion is independent of the truth of its premise \u2013 it is a 'non sequitur', since Jackson\nmight be a mammal without being human. He might be an elephant.\nAffirming the consequent is essentially the same as the fallacy of the undistributed middle, but using\npropositions rather than set membership.\nDenying the antecedent\nAnother common non sequitur is this:\n1. If A is true, then B is true.\n2. A is false.\n3. Therefore, B is false.\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. Citation: Wikipedia contributors.

If I am Japanese, then I am Asian.\n2. I am not Japanese.\n3. Therefore, I am not Asian.\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the\nstatement's declarant could be another ethnicity of Asia, e.g. Chinese, in which case the premise would\nbe true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true.\nAffirming a disjunct\nAffirming a disjunct is a fallacy when in the following form:\n1. A is true or B is true.\n2. B is true.\n3. Therefore, A is not true.*\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premise as it could be the case that A and B are both true. This\nfallacy stems from the stated definition of or in propositional logic to be inclusive.\nAn example of affirming a disjunct would be:\n1. I am at home or I am in the city.\n2. I am at home.\n3. Therefore, I am not in the city.\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the\ndeclarant of the statement very well could be in both the city and their home, in which case the premises\nwould be true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true.\n*Note that this is only a logical fallacy when the word \"or\" is in its inclusive form. If the two\npossibilities in question are mutually exclusive, this is not a logical fallacy. For example,\n1. I am either at home or I am in the city.\n2. I am at home.\n3. Therefore, I am not in the city.\nDenying a conjunct\nDenying a conjunct is a fallacy when in the following form:\n1. It is not the case that both A is true and B is true.\n17 Formal Fallacies 103 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n2. B is not true.\n3. Therefore, A is true.\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premise as it could be the case that A and B are both false.\nAn example of denying a conjunct would be:\n1. I cannot be both at home and in the city.\n2. I am not at home.\n3. Therefore, I am in the city.\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the\ndeclarant of the statement very well could neither be at home nor in the city, in which case the premise\nwould be true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true.\nFallacy of the undistributed middle\nThe fallacy of the undistributed middle is a fallacy that is committed when the middle term in a\ncategorical syllogism is not distributed. It is thus a syllogistic fallacy. More specifically it is also a form\nof non sequitur.\nThe fallacy of the undistributed middle takes the following form:\n1. All Zs are Bs.\n2. Y is a B.\n3. Therefore, Y is a Z.\nIt may or may not be the case that \"all Zs are Bs\", but in either case it is irrelevant to the conclusion.\nWhat is relevant to the conclusion is whether it is true that \"all Bs are Zs,\" which is ignored in the\nargument.\nAn example can be given as follows, where B=mammals, Y=Mary and Z=humans:\n1. All humans are mammals.\n2. Mary is a mammal.\n3. Therefore, Mary is a human.\nNote that if the terms (Z and B) were swapped around in the first co-premise then it would no longer be\na fallacy and would be correct.\n17 Formal Fallacies 104 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nUNIT FOUR: NATURAL DEDUCTIONS1\nAs we have seen, Truth Tables are powerful tools. They enable us to determine whether a given\nargument is valid or invalid using a simple test. However, truth tables do have their drawbacks. The\nfirst problem is that we have to wait for an argument to be presented to us before we can test it. This\nseems to lack a certain creativity. The second problem is that, as we learned, the rows of each Truth\nTable are determined by the number of atomic statements. This number is given by 2n, where n equals\nthe number of atomic statements. In arguments with only three statements, the truth table method is\nmanageable. However, an argument with 7 statements would quickly become difficult and time-\nconsuming to solve.\nThis brings us to another method of proof. As we will see, the basic idea is straightforward. Begin with\nwell-formed statements, and use only valid rules to make inferences from them. The resulting\nconclusions will also be valid. This method is commonly called Natural Deduction Proof, although as\nwe will see, I prefer to call it the Natural Deduction Game.\n1 Jason D. Sheley, 2019, printed here under a CC-BY license.\nUNIT FOUR: NATURAL DEDUCTIONS 105 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n18\nNatural Deduction: Four Basic Argument\nForms\nCommon Argument Forms Revisited1\nAlthough truth tables are our only formal method of deciding whether an argument is valid or invalid in\npropositional logic, there is another formal method of proving that an argument is valid: the method of\nproof. Although you cannot construct a proof to show that an argument is invalid, you can construct\nproofs to show that an argument is valid. The reason proofs are helpful, is that they allow us to show that\ncertain arguments are valid much more efficiently than do truth tables. For example, consider the\nfollowing argument:\n(R v S)\u2283(T\u2283K)\n~K\nR v S /\u2234 ~T\n(Note: in this section I will be writing the conclusion of the argument to the right of the last premise\u2014in\nthis case premise 3. As before, the conclusion we are trying to derive is denoted by the \u201ctherefore\u201d sign,\n\u201c\u2234\u201d.)\nWe could attempt to prove this argument is valid with a truth table, but the truth table would be 16 rows\nlong because there are four different atomic propositions that occur in this argument, R, S, T, and K. If\nthere were 5 or 6 different atomic propositions, the truth table would be 32 or 64 lines long! However, as\nwe will soon see, we could also prove this argument is valid with only two additional lines. That seems a\nmuch more efficient way of establishing that this argument is valid. We will do this a little later\u2014after\nwe have introduced the 8 valid forms of inference that you will need in order to do proofs. Each line of\nthe proof will be justified by citing one of these rules, with the last line of the proof being the conclusion\nthat we are trying to ultimately establish. I will introduce the 8 valid forms of inference in groups,\nstarting with the rules that utilize the horseshoe and negation.\nThe first common form of inference is \u201cmodus ponens\u201d which is Latin for \u201cway that affirms.\u201d Modus\nponens has the following form:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. p\n3. \u2234 q\n1 Van Cleave, Matthew J. (2016). Logic and Critical Thinking (v1.4). Lansing Community College. Printed here under a CC-\nBY license.\n18 Natural Deduction: Four Basic Argument Forms 106 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nWhat this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 q) and we have\nalso asserted the antecedent of that conditional statement (p), then we are entitled to infer the consequent\nof that conditional statement (q). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining, then the\nground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cit is raining\u201d (the antecedent of that conditional) then I (or anyone\nelse, for that matter) am entitled to assert the consequent of the conditional, \u201cthe ground is wet.\u201d\nAs with any valid forms of inference in this section, we can prove that modus ponens is valid by\nconstructing a truth table. As you see from the truth table below, this argument form passes the truth\ntable test of validity (since there is no row of the truth table on which the premises are all true and yet\nthe conclusion is false).\nP p\u2283q p q\nq\nT T T\nT T\nT F F T F\nF T T F T\nT F F\nF F\nThus, any argument that has this same form is valid. For example, the following argument also has this\nsame form (modus ponens):\n1. (A \u22c5 B) \u2283 C\n2. (A \u22c5 B)\n3. \u2234 C\nIn this argument we can assert C according to the rule, modus ponens. This is so even though the\nantecedent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a conjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first\npremise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operator) and the second premise\nis the antecedent of that conditional statement. The rule modus ponens says that if we have that much,\nwe are entitled to infer the consequent of the conditional.\nWe can actually use modus ponens in this argument:\n1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K)\n2. ~K\n3. R v S /\u2234 ~T\n18 Natural Deduction: Four Basic Argument Forms 107 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3\nWhat I have done here is I have written the valid form of inference (or rule) that justifies the line I am\nderiving, as well as the lines to which that rule applies, to the right of the new line of the proof that I am\nderiving. Here I have derived \u201cT \u2283 K\u201d from lines 1 and 3 of the argument by modus ponens. Notice that\nline 1 is a conditional statement and line 3 is the antecedent of that conditional statement. This proof\nisn\u2019t finished yet, since we have not yet derived the conclusion we are trying to derive, namely, \u201c~T.\u201d\nWe need a different rule to derive that, which we will introduce next.\nThe next form of inference is called \u201cmodus tollens,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cthe way that denies.\u201d Modus\ntollens has the following form:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. ~q\n3. \u2234 ~p\nWhat this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 q) and we have\nalso asserted the negated consequent of that conditional (~q), then we are entitled to infer the negated\nantecedent of that conditional statement (~p). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining,\nthen the ground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cthe ground is not wet\u201d (the negated consequent of that\nconditional) then I am entitled to assert the negated antecedent of the conditional, \u201cit is not raining.\u201d It is\nimportant to see that any argument that has this same form is a valid argument. For example, the\nfollowing argument is also an argument with this same form:\n1. C \u2283 (E v F)\n2. ~(E v F)\n3. \u2234 ~C\nIn this argument we can assert ~C according to the rule, modus tollens. This is so even though the\nconsequent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a disjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first\npremise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operator) and the second premise\nis the negated consequent of that conditional statement. The rule modus tollens says that if we have that\nmuch, we are entitled to infer the negated antecedent of the conditional. We can use modus tollens to\ncomplete the proof we started above:\n1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K)\n2. ~K\n3. R v S /\u2234 ~T\n4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3\n5. ~T Modus tollens, lines 2, 4\nNotice that the last line of the proof is the conclusion that we are supposed to derive and that each\nstatement that I have derived (i.e., lines 4 and 5) has a rule to the right. That rule cited is the rule that\njustifies the statement that is being derived and the lines cited are the previous lines of the proof where\nwe can see that the rule applies. This is what is called a proof. A proof is a series of statements, starting\nwith the premises and ending with the conclusion, where each additional statement after the premises is\n18 Natural Deduction: Four Basic Argument Forms 108 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nderived from some previous line(s) of the proof using one of the valid forms of inference. We will\npractice this some more in the exercise at the end of this section.\nThe next form of inference we will introduce is called \u201cdisjunctive syllogism\u201d and it has the following\nform:\n1. p v q\n2. ~p\n3. \u2234 q\nIn words, this rule states that if we have asserted a disjunction and we have asserted the negation of one\nof the disjuncts, then we are entitled to assert the other disjunct. Once you think about it, this inference\nshould be pretty obvious.\nIf we are taking for granted the truth of the premises\u2014that either p or q is true; and that p is not true\u2014\nthen is has to follow that q is true in order for the original disjunction to be true. (Remember that we\nmust assume the premises are true when evaluating whether an argument is valid.) If I assert that it is\ntrue that either Bob or Linda stole the diamond, and I assert that Bob did not steal the diamond, then it\nhas to follow that Linda did. That is a disjunctive syllogism. As before, any argument that has this same\nform is a valid argument. For example,\n1. ~A v (B \u22c5 C)\n2. ~~A\n3. \u2234 B \u22c5 C\nis a valid inference because it has the same form as disjunctive syllogism. The first premise is a\ndisjunction (since the wedge is the main operator), the second premise is simply the negation of the left\ndisjunct, \u201c~A\u201d, and the conclusion is the right disjunct of the original disjunction. It may help you to see\nthe form of the argument if you treat \u201c~A\u201d as the p and \u201cB \u22c5 C\u201d as the q. Also notice that the second\npremise contains a double negation. Your English teacher may tell you never to use double negatives,\nbut as far as logic is concerned, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a double negation. In this case,\nour left disjunct in premise 1 is itself a negation, while premise 2 is simply a negation of that left\ndisjunct.\nThe next form of inference is called \u201chypothetical syllogism.\u201d This is what ancient philosophers called\n\u201cthe chain argument\u201d and it should be obvious why in a moment. Here is the form of the rule:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. q \u2283 r\n3. \u2234 p \u2283 r\nAs you can see, the conclusion of this argument links p and r together in a conditional statement. We\ncould continue adding conditionals such as \u201cr \u2283 s\u201d and \u201cs \u2283 t\u201d and the inferences would be just as valid.\nAnd if we lined them all up as I have below, you can see why ancient philosophers referred to this valid\nargument form as a \u201cchain argument\u201d:\n18 Natural Deduction: Four Basic Argument Forms 109 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\np \u2283 q\nq \u2283 r\nr \u2283 s\ns \u2283 t\n\u2234 p \u2283 t\nNotice how the consequent of each preceding conditional statement links up with the antecedent of the\nnext conditional statement in such a way as to create a chain. The chain could be as long as we liked, but\nthe rule that we will cite in our proofs only connects two different conditional statements together. As\nbefore, it is important to realize that any argument with this same form is a valid argument. For example,\n1. (A v B) \u2283 ~D\n2. ~D \u2283 C\n3. \u2234 (A v B) \u2283 C\nNotice that the consequent of the first premise and the antecedent of the second premise are exactly the\nsame term, \u201c~D\u201d. That is what allows us to \u201clink\u201d the antecedent of the first premise and the consequent\nof the second premise together in a \u201cchain\u201d to infer the conclusion. Being able to recognize the forms of\nthese inferences is an important skill that you will have to become proficient at in order to do proofs.\n18 Natural Deduction: Four Basic Argument Forms 110 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n19\nProofs and the Natural Deduction Game1\nHow to Construct Proofs: The Natural Deduction Game\nSome students find it easier to imagine proofs as a kind of game. If it helps, we can imagine that our\nopponent is an evil wizard who has locked away the desired conclusion inside of the premises\nsomewhere. Our challenge is to \u201cunlock\u201d (i.e., derive) the correct conclusion using only our rules of\ninference and the given premises. We can think of our rules as \u201cmagic spells,\u201d and our premises as\n\u201cingredients for the spell.\u201d\nWith our game analogy, some things are worth pointing out. First, like most games, it helps to have the\nrules and moves memorized by heart. In this case, that means making sure we have memorized Modus\nPonens, Modus Tollens, etc. You will find it much easier to \u201cplay\u201d if the rules are committed to\nmemory. Second, game players often come in two varieties. One type of game player likes to learn all\nof the rules and strategy before ever attempting to play the game for the first time. You may know\nsomeone who likes to spend time looking at the rule book before playing a new game. The second type\nof game player likes to learn by playing the game, picking up the rules and strategy as they go. In what\nfollows, I\u2019m going to lay out the information in a way that favors the first type of game player. Students\nwho prefer to learn the game the second way I mentioned above may find it useful to watch some of the\nexample videos first before reading what follows.\nLet\u2019s consider an example:\n~C \u2283 (A \u2283C)\n~C\n/ \u2234~A\nWhen we work with proofs, we should always begin at the end, with the goal.\nIn this case: / \u2234~A.\nI like to think of the / as the \u201cchallenge bar:\u201d it sets the challenge for the game.\nIn this case, our challenge is to unlock ~A, or in other words, to derive ~A from the premises above.\nIf you like, this is the challenge that the evil wizard has set for us. We can practically hear him cackling\nat us: \u201cCan you prove ~A? Can you, mortal?!? Prove it, if you dare!\u201d\nWe now consider two essential tactics when working with our game. The first tactic I will call Bottom\nUp, or, Find the Conclusion first. The question here is, can I find something in the premises that is\neither my goal or something I can transform into my goal? In this case, I look to see whether I can find\n1 Jason D. Sheley, 2019, printed here under a CC-BY license.\n19 Proofs and the Natural Deduction Game 111 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n~A. I do not find ~A itself. However, I do find A, which is currently part of a conditional: (A\u2283C). We\nknow from our rules that Modus Tollens can be used to derive the negation of an antecedent. All we\nwould need is the negation of the consequent, in this case: ~C. It just so happens that ~C is our second\npremise, so we know we will use it eventually to derive ~A.\nThis brings us to an important feature of our game: we cannot unlock small pieces until we first unlock\nthe biggest pieces. In this case, (A\u2283C) is actually the consequent of a bigger conditional: ~C\u2283(A\u2283C)\nWe cannot use one of our rules on (A\u2283C) until we first take apart ~C\u2283(A\u2283C).\nNow for our second tactic when playing the game. I call this tactic Top Down, or, What Moves are\nAvailable? In this second tactic, we look at the premises as written, and see which ones can be\ncombined using our rules. Since we only have two lines in our set of premises, we look at how they are\nrelated.\n~C \u2283 (A \u2283C)\n~C\nWhat rule do we have that allows us to combine these two premises? We recall that Modus Ponens\nexhibits the following structure: If the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true. Place the\nantecedent. Therefore, place the consequent as the conclusion. In this case, ~C is our antecedent and\n(A \u2283C) is our consequent. Line #2 is ~C. Therefore, we derive the conclusion: (A \u2283C). We write our\nnew conclusion by creating a new line in our proof:\n~C \u2283 (A \u2283C)\n~C\n(A \u2283C)\nWe are not quite finished with line #3. In our game, remember that our evil wizard opponent told us that\nwe need to prove our conclusion. In order to do that, we need to show the wizard how we reached our\nnew conclusion. In this case, we show the lines we used (line 1 and line 2) and the logical rule that we\nused (Modus Ponens). The correct version of the sequence looks like this:\n~C \u2283 (A \u2283C)\n~C\n(A \u2283C) [1,2 MP]\nAre we finished with the proof? Well, we are now closer to our goal. However, we are not quite\nfinished yet. Remember that the evil wizard\u2019s challenge was to prove ~A. We now have (A \u2283C) as a\nline by itself, so we can now apply our logical rules to it. Recall that earlier when we applied our\nBottom Up tactic, we noticed that Modus Tollens would work to derive ~A from the conditional (A\n\u2283C). We are now in a position to apply the rule, which allows us to derive line #4 in our proof:\n~C \u2283 (A \u2283C)\n~C\n(A \u2283C) [1,2 MP]\n~A [2,3 MT]\n19 Proofs and the Natural Deduction Game 112 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nThe challenge was to prove ~A, and we have successfully proven it by using our logical rules and well\nformed sentences. We are victorious. We are happy; the wizard is sad.\nOne question that students often ask is, \u201cHow do I know which rule to use when deriving a new line?\u201d\nPart of the answer, of course, is practice: working with many proofs gives us experience in seeing what\nto do. However, the other part of the answer involves talking more about our tactics. Think of our four\nlogical rules again: Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Disjunctive Syllogism, Hypothetical Syllogism.\nEach rule has a different job to do. As we saw in our proof above, Modus Ponens is useful for deriving\nthe consequent of a conditional. Modus Tollens is useful when we need to derive the negation of the\nantecedent in a conditional. Disjunctive Syllogism is useful when we need to take apart a disjunction.\nIn those cases, we negate one side to derive the other side. Finally, Hypothetical Syllogism is useful\nwhen we need to derive a brand new conditional. In those cases, all we need are two conditionals with\nthe correct form.\nLike any game, we can improve our skill in the game with practice. As we improve, we will begin to\n\u201csee\u201d the moves we need to make. Over time, you will find that your speed in deriving new conclusions\nimproves. While it is a very good thing to get faster, it is important to remember to write down your\njustification with each step. Sometimes, mistakes are made if we try to rush through the proof.\n19 Proofs and the Natural Deduction Game 113 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n20\nNatural Deduction Practice Problems1\nUse your newly gained natural deduction skills to solve the following problems.

Instead of being valid or invalid, inductive arguments are either\nstrong or weak, which describes how probable it is that the conclusion is true. Another crucial difference\nis that deductive certainty is impossible in non-axiomatic systems, such as reality, leaving inductive\nreasoning as the primary route to (probabilistic) knowledge of such systems.\nGiven that \"if A is true then that would cause B, C, and D to be true\", an example of deduction would be\n\"A is true therefore we can deduce that B, C, and D are true\". An example of induction would be \"B, C,\nand D are observed to be true therefore A might be true\". A is a reasonable explanation for B, C, and D\nbeing true.\nFor example:\nA large enough asteroid impact would create a very large crater and cause a severe impact winter\nthat could drive the non-avian dinosaurs to extinction.\nWe observe that there is a very large crater in the Gulf of Mexico dating to very near the time of\nthe extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs\nTherefore it is possible that this impact could explain why the non-avian dinosaurs became\nextinct.\nNote however that this is not necessarily the case. Other events also coincide with the extinction of the\nnon-avian dinosaurs. For example, the Deccan Traps in India.\nA classical example of an incorrect inductive argument was presented by John Vickers:\nAll of the swans we have seen are white.\nTherefore, we know that all swans are white.\nThe correct conclusion would be, \"We expect that all swans are white\".\nThe definition of inductive reasoning described in this article excludes mathematical induction, which is\na form of deductive reasoning that is used to strictly prove properties of recursively defined sets. The\ndeductive nature of mathematical induction is based on the non-finite number of cases involved when\nusing mathematical induction, in contrast with the finite number of cases involved in an enumerative\ninduction procedure with a finite number of cases like proof by exhaustion. Both mathematical induction\nand proof by exhaustion are examples of complete induction. Complete induction is a type of masked\ndeductive reasoning.\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. Citation: Wikipedia contributors. (2018,\nSeptember 28).

That is, the conclusion\ncannot be false if the premises are true.\nIf a deductive conclusion follows duly from its premises it is valid; otherwise it is invalid (that an\nargument is invalid is not to say it is false. It may have a true conclusion, just not on account of the\npremises). An examination of the above examples will show that the relationship between premises and\nconclusion is such that the truth of the conclusion is already implicit in the premises. Bachelors are\nunmarried because we say they are; we have defined them so. Socrates is mortal because we have\nincluded him in a set of beings that are mortal.\nFor inductive reasoning the premises or prior data provide support for the conclusion, but they do\nnot guarantee it. The result is a conclusion having, it is often said, a \u201cdegree of certainty.\u201d The phrase is\nnot optimal since certainty is absolute and does not come in degrees; what is really meant is degrees\napproaching certainty. Succinctly put: deduction is about certainty/necessity; induction is about\nprobability. This is the best way to understand and remember the difference between inductive vs.\ndeductive reasoning. Any single assertion will answer to one of these two criteria. (There is also modal\nlogic, which deals with the distinction between the necessary and the possible in a way not concerned\nwith probabilities among things deemed possible.)\nInductive reasoning (as opposed to deductive reasoning or abductive reasoning) is a method of reasoning\nin which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of the conclusion. While the\nconclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may\nbe probable, based upon the evidence given.\nThe philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than simple progression from\nparticular/individual instances to broader generalizations. Rather, the premises of an inductive logical\nargument indicate some degree of support (inductive probability) for the conclusion but do not entail it;\nthat is, they suggest truth but do not ensure it. In this manner, there is the possibility of moving from\ngeneral statements to individual instances (for example, statistical syllogisms, discussed below).\nUNIT FIVE: INDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS 119 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n22\nCogency and Strong Arguments1\nStrength and Weakness\nInductive arguments are said to be either strong or weak. There\u2019s no absolute cut-off between strength\nand weakness, but some arguments will be very strong and others very weak, so the distinction is still\nuseful even if it is not precise.\nA strong argument is one where, if the premises were true, the conclusion would be very likely to be\ntrue. A weak argument is one where the conclusion does not follow from the premises (i.e. even if the\npremises were true, there would still be a good chance that the conclusion could be false.)\nMost arguments in courts of law attempt to be strong arguments; they are generally not attempts at valid\narguments.\nSo, the following example is a strong argument.\nJohn was found with a gun in his hand, running from the apartment where Tom's body was\nfound. Three witnesses heard a gunshot right before they saw John run out. The gun in John's\npossession matched the ballistics on the bullet pulled from Tom's head. John had written a series\nof threatening letters to Tom. In prison, John confessed to his cellmate that he had killed Tom.\nTherefore, John is the murder of Tom.\nGiven that all the premises were true, it would be very likely that the conclusion would be true.\nImportantly, strength has nothing to do with the actual truth of the premises!\nThis is something people frequently forget, so it\u2019s worth repeating: A STRONG ARGUMENT\nNEEDN\u2019T HAVE ANY TRUE PREMISES! ALL THE PREMISES OF A STRONG ARGUMENT\nCAN BE FALSE!\nThe argument is strong because: if the premises WERE true, the conclusion would be likely to be true.\nSo the following arguments are strong:\n98% of Dominicans have superpowers. Lucy is Dominican. I saw Lucy leap from the top of a tall\nbuilding last week and walk away unscathed. Lucy has superpowers.\nPeople from the lost continent of Atlantis have been manipulating the world\u2019s governments for\n1 This section reprinted from: DiGiovanna, James. 2013.

Whenever possible, they place an\nAtlantean wizard in the executive position of the most powerful government on earth. They did\nthis in the Roman empire, the Mongol empire, and the British empire. Currently, the United\nStates is the most powerful country on earth. Barack Obama was born in Hawai\u2019i, where about\n45% of the people are actually Atlanteans. While he was a Senator from Illinois, he received\nover 10 billion dollars in funds from a mysterious holding company called \u201cAtlantis\nIncorporated.\u201d Several journalists claim that they have seen Barack Obama perform feats of\nmagic. For example, Shep Smith of Fox News said he saw Barack Obama walk on water. Barack\nObama is clearly an Atlantean wizard.\nTwo leading researchers in genetics have found that, in every sample of DNA they looked at,\nthere were traces of kryptonite. They examined 1600 samples, from 1600 separate individuals,\nincluding an equal distribution from all continents. The results were then replicated in another,\nlarger study of 2700 samples, also taken from all continents. We conclude, then, that normal\nDNA contains kryptonite.\nCogency: If an argument is strong and all its premises are true, the argument is said to be cogent.\nThe following arguments are weak. The premises provide little, if any, evidence for the conclusions:\nI saw your boyfriend last night and he was talking to another girl. So he\u2019s cheating on you.\nSenator Bonham served 8 years in military, whereas his opponent, Mr. Malham never served one\nday of military service. So you should vote for Senator Bonham.\nMore people buy Juff \u2122 brand peanut butter than any other brand, so you should by Juff \u2122!\nIt\u2019s notable, again, that the truth of the premises is irrelevant. A weak argument can have true premises\nand a true conclusion. What makes it weak is that the premises do not provide good reason to believe the\nconclusion.\nInduction2\nAll of the argument forms we have looked at so far have been deductively valid. That meant, we said,\nthat the conclusion follows from necessity if the premises are true. But to what extent can we ever be\nsure of the truth of those premises? Inductive argumentation is a less certain, more realistic, more\nfamiliar way of reasoning that we all do, all the time. Inductive argumentation recognizes, for instance,\nthat a premise like \u201cAll horses have four legs\u201d comes from our previous experience of horses. If one day\nwe were to encounter a three-legged horse, deductive logic would tell us that \u201cAll horses have four legs\u201d\nis false, at which point the premise becomes rather useless for a deducer. In fact, deductive logic tells us\nthat if the premise \u201cAll horses have four legs\u201d is false, even if we know there are many, many four-\nlegged horses in the world, when we go to the track and see hordes of four-legged horses, all we can\nreally be certain of is that \u201cThere is at least one four-legged horse.\u201d\n2 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

And\ninductive logic can use this premise to infer other useful information, like \u201cIf I\u2019m going to get Chestnut\nbooties for Christmas, I should probably get four of them.\u201d The trick is to recognize a certain amount of\nuncertainty in the truth of the conclusion, something for which deductive logic does not allow. In real\nlife, however, inductive logic is used much more frequently and (hopefully) with some success. Let\u2019s\ntake a look at some of the uses of inductive reasoning.\nPredicting the Future\nWe constantly use inductive reasoning to predict the future. We do this by compiling evidence based on\npast observations, and by assuming that the future will resemble the past. For instance, I make the\nobservation that every other time I have gone to sleep at night, I have woken up in the morning. There is\nactually no certainty that this will happen, but I make the inference because of the fact that this is what\nhas happened every other time. In fact, it is not the case that \u201cAll people who go to sleep at night wake\nup in the morning\u201d. But I\u2019m not going to lose any sleep over that. And we do the same thing when our\nexperience has been less consistent. For instance, I might make the assumption that, if there\u2019s someone\nat the door, the dog will bark. But it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that the dog is asleep, has gone\nout for a walk, or has been persuaded not to bark by a clever intruder with sedative-laced bacon. I make\nthe assumption that if there\u2019s someone at the door, the dog will bark, because that is what usually\nhappens.\nExplaining Common Occurrences\nWe also use inductive reasoning to explain things that commonly happen. For instance, if I\u2019m about to\nstart an exam and notice that Bill is not here, I might explain this to myself with the reason that Bill is\nstuck in traffic. I might base this on the reasoning that being stuck in traffic is a common excuse for\nbeing late, or because I know that Bill never accounts for traffic when he\u2019s estimating how long it will\ntake him to get somewhere. Again, that Bill is actually stuck in traffic is not certain, but I have some\ngood reasons to think it\u2019s probable. We use this kind of reasoning to explain past events as well. For\ninstance, if I read somewhere that 1986 was a particularly good year for tomatoes, I assume that 1986\nalso had some ideal combination of rainfall, sun, and consistently warm temperatures. Although it\u2019s\npossible that a scientific madman circled the globe planting tomatoes wherever he could in 1986,\ninductive reasoning would tell me that the former, environmental explanation is more likely. (But I\ncould be wrong.)\nGeneralizing\nOften we would like to make general claims, but in fact it would be very difficult to prove any general\nclaim with any certainty. The only way to do so would be to observe every single case of something\nabout which we wanted to make an observation. This would be, in fact, the only way to prove such\nassertions as, \u201cAll swans are white\u201d. Without being able to observe every single swan in the universe, I\ncan never make that claim with certainty. Inductive logic, on the other hand, allows us to make the\nclaim, with a certain amount of modesty.\nInductive Generalization\nInductive generalization allows us to make general claims, despite being unable to actually observe\nevery single member of a class in order to make a certainly true general statement. We see this in\nscientific studies, population surveys, and in our own everyday reasoning. Take for example a drug\n22 Cogency and Strong Arguments 122 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nstudy. Some doctor or other wants to know how many people will go blind if they take a certain amount\nof some drug for so many years. If they determine that 5% of people in the study go blind, they then\nassume that 5% of all people who take the drug for that many years will go blind. Likewise, if I survey a\nrandom group of people and ask them what their favourite colour is, and 75% of them say \u201cpurple\u201d, then\nI assume that purple is the favourite colour of 75% of people. But we have to be careful when we make\nan inductive generalization. When you tell me that 75% of people really like purple, I\u2019m going to want\nto know whether you took that survey outside a Justin Bieber concert.\nLet\u2019s take an example. Let\u2019s say I asked a class of 400 students whether or not they think logic is a\nvaluable course, and 90% of them said yes. I can make an inductive argument like this:\n(P1) 90% of 400 students believe that logic is a valuable course.\n(C) Therefore 90% of students believe that logic is a valuable course.\nThere are certain things I need to take into account in judging the quality of this argument. For instance,\ndid I ask this in a logic course? Did the respondents have to raise their hands so that the professor could\nsee them, or was the survey taken anonymously? Are there enough students in the course to justify using\nthem as a representative group for students in general?\nIf I did, in fact, make a class of 400 logic students raise their hands in response to the question of\nwhether logic is valuable course, then we can identify a couple of problems with this argument. The first\nis bias. We can assume that anyone enrolled in a logic course is more likely to see it as valuable than any\nrandom student. I have therefore skewed the argument in favour of logic courses. I can also question\nwhether the students were answering the question honestly. Perhaps if they are trying to save the\nprofessor\u2019s feelings, they are more likely to raise their hands and assure her that the logic course is a\nvaluable one.\nNow let\u2019s say I\u2019ve avoided those problems. I have assured that the 400 students I have asked are\nrandomly selected, say, by soliciting email responses from randomly selected students from the\nuniversity\u2019s entire student population. Then the argument looks stronger.\nAnother problem we might have with the argument is whether I have asked enough students so that the\nwhole population is well-represented. If the student body as a whole consists of 400 students, my\nargument is very strong. If the student body numbers in the tens of thousands, I might want to ask a few\nmore before assuming that the opinions of a few mirror those of the many. This would be a problem\nwith my sample size.\nLet\u2019s take another example. Now I\u2019m going to run a scientific study, in which I will pay someone $50 to\ntake a drug with unknown effects and see if it makes them blind. In order to control for other variables, I\nopen the study only to white males between the ages of 18 and 25.\nA bad inductive argument would say:\n(P1) 40% of 1000 people who took the drug went blind.\n(C) Therefore 40% of people who take the drug will go blind.\n22 Cogency and Strong Arguments 123 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nA better inductive argument would make a more modest claim:\n(P1) 40% of the 1000 people who took the drug went blind.\n(C) Therefore 40% of white males between the ages of 18 and 25 who take the drug will go\nblind.\nThe point behind this example is to show how inductive reasoning imposes an important limitation on\nthe possible conclusions a study or a survey can make. In order to make good generalizations, we need\nto ensure that our sample is representative, non-biased, and sufficiently sized.\nStatistical Syllogism\nWhere in an inductive generalization we saw statement expressing a statistic applied to a more general\ngroup, we can also use statistics to go from the general to the particular. For instance, if I know that\nmost computer science majors are male, and that some random individual with the androgynous name\n\u201cCameron\u201d is an computer science major, then we can be reasonably certain that Cameron is a male. We\ntend to represent the uncertainty by qualifying the conclusion with the word \u201cprobably\u201d. If, on the other\nhand, we wanted to say that something is unlikely, like that Cameron were a female, we could use\n\u201cprobably not\u201d. It is also possible to temper our conclusion with other similar qualifying words.\nLet\u2019s take an example.\n(P1) Of the 133 people found guilty of homicide last year in Canada, 79% were jailed.\n(P2) Socrates was found guilty of homicide last year in Canada.\n(C) Therefore, Socrates was probably jailed.\nIn this case we can be reasonably sure that Socrates is currently rotting in prison. Now the certainty of\nour conclusion seems to be dependent on the statistics we\u2019re dealing with. There are definitely more\ncertain and more uncertain cases.\n(P1) In the last election, 50% of voting Americans voted for Obama, while 48% voted for\nRomney.\n(P2) Jim is a voting American.\n(C) Therefore, Jim probably voted for Obama.\nClearly, this argument is not as strong as the first. It is only slightly more likely than not that Jim voted\nfor Obama. In this case we might want to revise our conclusion to say:\n(C) Therefore, it is slightly more likely than not that Jim voted for Obama.\nIn other cases, the likelihood that something is or is not the case approaches certainty. For example:\n(P1) There is a 0.00000059% chance you will die on any single flight, assuming you use one of\nthe most poorly rated airlines.\n(P2) I\u2019m flying to Paris next week.\n(C) There\u2019s more than a million to one chance that I will die on my flight.\nNote that in all of these examples, nothing is ever stated with absolute certainty. It is possible to improve\n22 Cogency and Strong Arguments 124 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nthe chances that our conclusions will be accurate by being more specific, or finding out more\ninformation. We would know more about Jim\u2019s voting strategy, for instance, if we knew where he lived,\nhis previous voting habits, or if we simply asked him for whom he voted (in which case, we might also\nwant to know how often Jim lies).\nInduction by Shared Properties\nInduction by shared properties involves noting the similarity between two things with respect to their\nproperties, and inferring from this that they may share other properties.\nA familiar example of this is how a company might recommend products to you based on other\ncustomers\u2019 purchases. Amazon.com tells me, for instance, that customers who bought the complete Sex\nand the City DVD series also bought Lipstick Jungle and Twilight.\nAssuming that people buy things because they like them, we can rephrase this as:\n(P1) There are a large number of people who, if they like Sex and the City and Twilight, will\nalso like Lipstick Jungle.\nI could also make the following observation:\n(P2) I like Sex and the City and Twilight.\nAnd then infer from there two premises that:\n(C) I would also like Lipstick Jungle.\nAnd I did. In general, induction by shared properties assumes that if something has properties w, x, y,\nand z, and if something else has properties w, x, and y, then it\u2019s reasonable to assume that that\nsomething else also has property z. Note that in the above example all of the properties were actually\npreferences with regard to entertainment. The kinds of properties involved in the comparison can and\nwill make an argument better or worse. Let\u2019s consider a worse induction.\n(P1) Lisa is tall, has blonde hair, has blue eyes, and rocks out to Nirvana on weekends.\n(P2) Gina is tall, has blonde hair, and has blue eyes.\n(C) Therefore Gina probably rocks out to Nirvana on weekends.\nIn this case the properties don\u2019t seem to be related in the same way as in the first example. While the\nfirst three are physical characteristics, the last property instead indicates to us that Lisa is stuck in a 90\u2019s\ngrunge phase. Gina, though she shares several properties with Lisa, might not share the same undying\nlove for Kurt Cobain. Let\u2019s try a stronger argument.\n(P1) Bob and Dick both wear plaid shirts all the time, wear large plastic-rimmed glasses, and\nlisten to bands you\u2019ve never heard of.\n(P2) Bob drinks PBR.\n(C) Dick probably also drinks PBR.\n22 Cogency and Strong Arguments 125 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nHere we can identify the qualities that Bob and Dick have in common as symptoms of hipsterism. The\nfact that Bob drinks PBR is another symptom of this affectation. Given that Dick is exhibiting most of\nthe same symptoms, the idea that Dick would also drink PBR is a reasonable assumption to make.\nPractical Uses\nA procedure very much like Induction by Shared Properties is performed by nurses and doctors when\nthey diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. Their thinking goes like this:\n(P1) Patients who have elephantitus display an increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, a\nrash on their skin, and a strong desire to visit the elephant pen at the zoo.\n(P2) The patient here in front of me has an increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and a\nstrong desire to visit the elephant pen at the zoo.\n(C) It is probable, therefore, that the patient here in front of me has elephantitus.\nThe more that a patient\u2019s symptoms match the \u2018textbook definition\u2019 of a given disease, then the more\nlikely it is that the patient has that disease. Caregivers then treat the patient for the\ndisease that they think the patient probably has. If the disease doesn\u2019t respond to the treatment, or the\npatient starts to present different symptoms, then they consider other conditions with similar symptoms\nthat the patient is likely to have.\nInduction by Shared Relations\nInduction by shared relations is much like induction by shared properties, except insofar that what is\nshared are not properties, but relations. A simple example is the causal relation, from which we might\nmake an inductive argument like this:\n(P1) Percocet, Oxycontin and Morphine reduce pain, cause drowsiness, and may be habit\nforming.\n(P2) Heroin also reduces pain and causes drowsiness.\n(C) Heroin is probably also habit forming.\nIn this case the effects of reducing pain, drowsiness, and addiction are all assumed to be caused by the\ndrugs listed. We can use an induction by shared relation to make the probable conclusion that if heroin,\nlike the other drugs, reduces pain and causes drowsiness, it is probably also habit forming.\nAnother interesting example are the relations we have with other people. For instance, Facebook knows\neverything about you. But let\u2019s focus on the \u201cfriends with\u201d relation. They compare who your friends are\nwith the friends of your friends in order to determine who else you might actually know. The induction\ngoes a little like this:\n(P1) Donna is friends with Brandon, Kelly, Steve, and Brenda.\n(P2) David is friends with Brandon, Kelly, and Steve.\n(C) David probably also knows Brenda.\nWe could strengthen that argument if we knew that Brandon, Kelly, Steve, and Brenda were all friends\nwith each other as well. We could also make an alternate conclusion based on the same argument above:\n22 Cogency and Strong Arguments 126 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n(C) David probably also knows Donna.\nThey do, after all, know at least three of the same people. They\u2019ve probably run into each other at some\npoint.\n22 Cogency and Strong Arguments 127 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n23\nCausality and Scientific Reasoning1\nThe main thing to understand here is rather simple:\nAlways pay close attention to the relationships between correlated events by separating causes\nfrom effects and determining which causes produced which effects.\nSo what do I mean by this? First, remember that correlation simply means that two things happen\ntogether. This says nothing about how they relate \u2013 I am always around air, but I don\u2019t cause the air to\nexist and air does not cause me to exist. Air is necessary for me to exist, however. Causation is\nconcerned with one event or thing causing another event or thing. Here is an example of these concepts\nfrom a few months back when my daughter was 2 years old:\nShe was coughing a lot and she knows she's sick when she coughs, so she said, \u201cCough make me\nsick.\u201d Coughing and being sick are correlated, but does coughing make her sick? Probably not.\nPerhaps the best way of explaining how these work and their importance is through a contemporary\nexample, that is, unfortunately, controversial. By clarifying the issues, we can carve away the bits that\nare uncontroversial and figure out what people get so mad about \u2013 which is really a quite simple thing,\nbut this is a simple thing that people will disagree a lot about. Here\u2019s my example:\nScientists almost universally agree that the following three claims are true: (1) The world is\ngetting warmer at a rate faster than it ever has in the past; (2) The level of carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere is increasing at a very fast rate; and (3) The burning of fossil fuels releases a lot of\ncarbon dioxide.\nEveryone should be able to accept these as uncontroversial now, but as we know healthy skepticism is a\ngood thing. 10 years ago, the jury was out on these \u2013 but now the jury seems to be settled. And honestly,\nthere is no reason for someone to deny these as facts because no one should really care if any of these\nare true. What people care about are the relationships between these and their effects. If all of these\nwere true and nothing else in the world changed, no one would care. Let\u2019s examine these things and see\nhow they might relate: are increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide causing fossil fuels to\nproduce more carbon dioxide? Probably not \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s the other way, and burning fossil fuels\nincreases the amount of carbon dioxide. So what\u2019s the main thing to examine now?\n1) Is the burning of fossil fuels causing the carbon dioxide to increase to levels that is causing the\nworld to get warmer?\n- It seems that the answer is almost definitely yes, but all the impacts and sources of\natmospheric carbon dioxide are still being worked out. However, none of this is even if\n1 Noah Levin, 2018, printed here under a CC BY license\n23 Causality and Scientific Reasoning 128 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nthe real issue people care about. In fact, burning fossil fuels might even be completely\nirrelevant to the real question people care about:\n2) If global warming is happening, should people do anything about it?\n- The effects of global warming should be understood before we can give an answer to this.\nIf the effects are bad, then regardless of the cause, perhaps we should do something to\nstop or slow global warming. Or perhaps we shouldn\u2019t care about it and adapt to a hotter\nworld. Now, if it turns out carbon dioxide emissions by humans are contributing to global\nwarming and it\u2019s bad and we think we should do something to stop these bad effects, then\nperhaps we should cut carbon dioxide emissions. The issue is not one directly about\nwhether global warming is happening, and it never really was: it\u2019s about what to do if\nglobal warming has detrimental effects and if what we can do is worth doing.\nSo there you go \u2013 the global warming debate simplified by examining causes and effects. So why do\npeople focus so much on the issue of whether or not the earth is getting hotter? Because if it isn\u2019t, then\nmaybe there\u2019s nothing we need to do. But, even if it is getting hotter, that still doesn\u2019t necessarily mean\nthere\u2019s something we need to do. Everyone can accept what the scientific community says about these\nissues because the real point of disagreement is what, if anything, should be done about the problem (if\nthere is one). It is also important to note that in doing analyses like this, you have to appreciate when one\nthing is sufficient or necessary to produce to another.\nAnother important thing to remember is the difference between a justification and an explanation. For\nexample, if your car stereo is missing from your car and the window is broken, you would believe your\ncar was burglarized. The justification for the belief your car was burglarized is that your radio is\nmissing. The explanation for why your radio is missing is that your car was burglarized. Justifications\nhelp to support a belief whereas an explanation just gives the information necessary to explain\nsomething.\nOckham\u2019s (or Occam\u2019s) Razor\nOn Wikipedia at one point, the entry for Occam's razor looked like this:\n- Sentence in the introduction: \u201cOther things being equal, a simpler explanation is better\nthan a more complex one.\u201d\n- The first sentence of the overview (which was the next sentence): The principle is often\nincorrectly summarized as \u201cother things being equal, a simpler explanation is better than\na more complex one.\u201d\n- Now it says: \u201cIt states that among competing hypotheses, the one that makes the fewest\nassumptions should be selected.\u201d Or, in other words, \u201cdon't multiply causes beyond\nnecessity\u201d\nThree things about this: Don\u2019t trust Wikipedia as much as you might want to, read it carefully, and\nremember to not make things overly complex.\nThe last definition is pretty much correct. Here\u2019s my example that I always use to illustrate what\nthis means: What happens when I raise my arm? My brain says \u201cmove\u201d, tendons do things, muscles do\nthings, bones do things, etc. Now, let\u2019s say that all of this is true, BUT at the exact same time,\n23 Causality and Scientific Reasoning 129 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\ninvisible hot pink fairies wearing leather jackets have tied invisible string around my arms and\nare pulling them. Does this sound plausible to you? It better not \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous. Ockham\u2019s razor\nsays to forget that extra thing (the fairies) because the first bit of information was enough to\nexplain how my arms move.\n23 Causality and Scientific Reasoning 130 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n24\nAnalogy1\nAnalogies are comparisons between two things to help in clarification or explanation. They can be used\nas simple illustrative tools to aid in understanding, like how you might explain to someone that\nrollerblading is like ice skating on hard, dry surfaces. We use analogies all the time, but for the current\nlesson, the focus will be on using analogies to make arguments.\nAn argument from analogy generally has the following form:\n- A has properties P,Q,R\u2026\n- B,C,D\u2026 have properties P,Q,R\u2026\n- B,C,D\u2026 also have property Z\n- Therefore, A probably has property Z\nThat might make it sound more complicated than it actually is, but that\u2019s the technical way in which\nthey work. You observe that something has certain properties, you then observe that something else has\nmany similar properties, AND they have more properties, so that first thing probably has the property as\nwell. For example,\n- In-line skating has all the wheels in a line and requires very good balance.\n- Ice skating has one blade in a straight line on each skate, requires very good balance, and\nI\u2019m very bad at it.\n- Therefore, I am probably very bad at in-line skating.\nOr,\n- Playing Skee-Ball requires you roll a ball at a target and that makes it fun.\n- Bowling requires that you roll a ball at a target, so that probably makes it fun, too.\nWhen making an argument from analogy, you should always remember to consider important\ndisanalogies, because one important disanalogy can make the argument fall apart. For an analogy to\nwork, all of the aspects that are being compared need to be true, relevant, important, and absent any\nimportant disanalogies! So, is the following a good analogy?\n- Cars pollute a lot, so Tesla Roadsters pollute a lot.\nGenerally, arguments from analogy are stronger when there are more and closer analogies used in the\nargument (and Tesla Roadsters have a lot of similarities with regular cars), but a single important\ndisanalogy (Tesla Roasters are electric cars) can destroy the argument.\nWhat makes arguments from analogy better?\n1 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

We'll see shortly how to solve it.)\nSuppose you are a nurse screening a set of students for a sickness called Diseasitis.1\n\u2022 You know, from past population studies, that around 20% of the students will have Diseasitis at\nthis time of year.\nYou are testing for Diseasitis using a color-changing tongue depressor, which usually turns black if the\nstudent has Diseasitis.\n\u2022 Among patients with Diseasitis, 90% turn the tongue depressor black.\n\u2022 However, the tongue depressor is not perfect, and also turns black 30% of the time for healthy\nstudents.\nOne of your students comes into the office, takes the test, and turns the tongue depressor black. What is\nthe probability that they have Diseasitis?\n(If you think you see how to do it, you can try to solve this problem before continuing. To quickly see if\nyou got your answer right, you can expand the \"Answer\" button below; the derivation will be given\nshortly.)\nThe probability a student with a blackened tongue depressor has Diseasitis is 3/7, roughly 43%.\nThis problem can be solved a hard way or a clever easy way. We'll walk through the hard way first.\nFirst, we imagine a population of 100 students, of whom 20 have Diseasitis and 80 don't.2\n1 Taken from https://arbital.com/p/bayes_frequency_diagram/?l=55z&pathId=39383 . Licensed under cc by-sa 3.0 with\nattribution required.\n25 Statistical Reasoning: Bayes\u2019 Theorem 133 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n90% of sick students turn their tongue depressor black, and 30% of healthy students turn the tongue\ndepressor black. So we see black tongue depressors on 90% * 20 = 18 sick students, and 30% * 80 = 24\nhealthy students.\nWhat's the probability that a student with a black tongue depressor has Diseasitis? From the diagram,\nthere are 18 sick students with black tongue depressors. 18 + 24 = 42 students in total turned their\ntongue depressors black. Imagine reaching into a bag of all the students with black tongue depressors,\nand pulling out one of those students at random; what's the chance a student like that is sick?\n25 Statistical Reasoning: Bayes\u2019 Theorem 134 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nThe final answer is that a patient with a black tongue depressor has an 18/42 = 3/7 = 43% probability of\nbeing sick.\nMany medical students have at first found this answer counter-intuitive: The test correctly detects\nDiseasitis 90% of the time! If the test comes back positive, why is it still less than 50% likely that the\npatient has Diseasitis? Well, the test also incorrectly \"detects\" Diseasitis 30% of the time in a healthy\npatient, and we start out with lots more healthy patients than sick patients.\nThe test does provide some evidence in favor of of the patient being sick. The probability of a patient\nbeing sick goes from 20% before the test, to 43% after we see the tongue depressor turn black. But this\nisn't conclusive, and we need to perform further tests, maybe more expensive ones.\nIf you feel like you understand this problem setup, consider trying to answer the following question\nbefore proceeding: What's the probability that a student who does not turn the tongue depressor black - a\nstudent with a negative test result - has Diseasitis? Again, we start out with 20% sick and 80% healthy\nstudents, 70% of healthy students will get a negative test result, and only 10% of sick students will get a\nnegative test result.\nImagine 20 sick students and 80 healthy students. 10% * 20 = 2 sick students have negative test results.\n70% * 80 = 56 healthy students have negative test results. Among the 2+56=58 total students with\nnegative test results, 2 students are sick students with negative test results. So 2/58 = 1/29 = 3.4% of\nstudents with negative test results have Diseasitis.\nNow let's turn to a faster, easier way to solve the same problem.\nImagine a waterfall with two streams of water at the top, a red stream and a blue stream. These streams\nseparately approach the top of the waterfall, with some of the water from both streams being diverted\nalong the way, and the remaining water falling into a shared pool below.\n25 Statistical Reasoning: Bayes\u2019 Theorem 135 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nSuppose that:\n\u2022 At the top of the waterfall, 20 gallons/second of red water are flowing down, and 80\ngallons/second of blue water are coming down.\n\u2022 90% of the red water makes it to the bottom.\n\u2022 30% of the blue water makes it to the bottom.\nOf the purplish water that makes it to the bottom of the pool, how much was originally from the red\nstream and how much was originally from the blue stream?\nThis is structurally identical to the Diseasitis problem from before:\n\u2022 20% of the patients in the screening population start out with Diseasitis.\n\u2022 Among patients with Diseasitis, 90% turn the tongue depressor black.\n\u2022 30% of the patients without Diseasitis will also turn the tongue depressor black.\nThe 20% of sick patients are analogous to the 20 gallons/second of red water; the 80% of healthy\npatients are analogous to the 80 gallons/second of blue water:\n25 Statistical Reasoning: Bayes\u2019 Theorem 136 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nThe 90% of the sick patients turning the tongue depressor black is analogous to 90% of the red water\nmaking it to the bottom of the waterfall. 30% of the healthy patients turning the tongue depressor black\nis analogous to 30% of the blue water making it to the bottom pool.\n25 Statistical Reasoning: Bayes\u2019 Theorem 137 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nTherefore, the question \"what portion of water in the final pool came from the red stream?\" has the same\nanswer as the question \"what portion of patients that turn the tongue depressor black are sick with\nDiseasitis?\"\nNow for the faster way of answering that question.\nWe start with 4 times as much blue water as red water at the top of the waterfall.\nThen each molecule of red water is 90% likely to make it to the shared pool, and each molecule of blue\nwater is 30% likely to make it to the pool. (90% of red water and 30% of blue water make it to the\nbottom.) So each molecule of red water is 3 times as likely (0.90 / 0.30 = 3) as a molecule of blue water\nto make it to the bottom.\nSo we multiply prior proportions for red vs. blue by relative likelihoods of and end up with final\nproportions that mean that the bottom pool has 3 parts of red water to 4 parts of blue water.\nTo convert these relative proportions into an absolute probability that a random water molecule at the\nbottom is red, we calculate 3 / (3 + 4) to see that 3/7ths (roughly 43%) of the water in the shared pool\ncame from the red stream.\nThis proportion is the same as the 18 : 24 sick patients with positive results, versus healthy patients with\npositive test results, that we would get by thinking about 100 patients.\nThat is, to solve the Diseasitis problem in your head, you could convert this word problem:\n25 Statistical Reasoning: Bayes\u2019 Theorem 138 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n20% of the patients in a screening population have Diseasitis. 90% of the patients with Diseasitis turn\nthe tongue depressor black, and 30% of the patients without Diseasitis turn the tongue depressor black.\nGiven that a patient turned their tongue depressor black, what is the probability that they have\nDiseasitis?\nOkay, so the initial odds are (20% : 80%) = (1 : 4), and the likelihoods are (90% : 30%) = (3 : 1).\nMultiplying those ratios gives final odds of (3 : 4), which converts to a probability of 3/7ths.\n(You might not be able to convert 3/7 to 43% in your head, but you might be able to eyeball that it was a\nchunk less than 50%.)\nYou can try doing a similar calculation for this problem:\n\u2022 90% of widgets are good and 10% are bad.\n\u2022 12% of bad widgets emit sparks.\n\u2022 Only 4% of good widgets emit sparks.\nWhat percentage of sparking widgets are bad? If you are sufficiently comfortable with the setup, try\ndoing this problem entirely in your head.\n(You might try visualizing a waterfall with good and bad widgets at the top, and only sparking widgets\nmaking it to the bottom pool.)\n\u2022 There's (1 : 9) bad vs. good widgets.\n\u2022 Bad vs. good widgets have a (12 : 4) relative likelihood to spark.\n\u2022 This simplifies to (1 : 9) x (3 : 1) = (3 : 9) = (1 : 3), 1 bad sparking widget for every 3 good\nsparking widgets.\n\u2022 Which converts to a probability of 1/(1+3) = 1/4 = 25%; that is, 25% of sparking widgets are\nbad.\nSeeing sparks didn't make us \"believe the widget is bad\"; the probability only went to 25%, which is less\nthan 50/50. But this doesn't mean we say, \"I still believe this widget is good!\" and toss out the evidence\nand ignore it. A bad widget is relatively more likely to emit sparks, and therefore seeing this evidence\nshould cause us to think it relatively more likely that the widget is a bad one, even if the probability\nhasn't yet gone over 50%. We increase our probability from 10% to 25%.\nWaterfalls are one way of visualizing the \"odds form\" of \"Bayes' rule\", which states that the prior odds\ntimes the likelihood ratio equals the posterior odds. In turn, this rule can be seen as formalizing the\nnotion of \"the strength of evidence\" or \"how much a piece of evidence should make us update our\nbeliefs\".\n25 Statistical Reasoning: Bayes\u2019 Theorem 139 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\n26\nLegal Reasoning and Moral Reasoning1\nBy employing a healthy skepticism and dosage of reasonable doubt, we can be sure that what we\nbelieve has been hard-earned through careful and cautious analysis. In this discussion of moral\nreasoning, we will learn how to decide what to do. In this sense, moral reasoning is the most practical\npart of the process. When we reason about morality we build arguments, just like when we reason about\nanything else. But arguments involving moral propositions have to be constructed in a special way. This\nis partly to help us avoid the Naturalistic Fallacy. But it is also to help ensure that our arguments about\nmorality are consistent.\nFeatures of Moral Arguments\nThe main thing that makes an argument about morality distinct from other kinds of arguments is\nthat moral arguments are made of moral statements, at least in part. A moral statement, as you might\nguess, is a statement about morality: it is a statement that says something about what\u2019s right or wrong,\ngood or evil, just or unjust, virtuous and wicked. Moral statements are not like other propositions: they\ndo not talk about what is the case or not the case. Rather, moral statements talk about what should be the\ncase, or what should not be the case. Look for moral indicator words like \u2018should\u2019, \u2018ought\u2019, \u2018must\u2019, \u2018is\nright\u2019, \u2018is wrong\u2019, and the like. And look for the language of character-qualities, like \u2018temperance\u2019,\n\u2018prudence\u2019, \u2018friendship\u2019, \u2018coldness\u2019, \u2018generosity\u2019, \u2018miserliness\u2019, and so on. Sometimes, sentences written\nin the imperative voice (i.e. sentences which are commands) are moral statements in which some of the\nmoral indicator words have been left out.\nThus, a sentence like \u201cShare your toys!\u201d could mean, \u201cYou should share your toys!\u201d But to be\nfully logical, it\u2019s necessary to phrase imperative sentences that way in order to fit them into moral\narguments, and find out whether they are sound. It\u2019s also easy to fall into the fallacy of equivocation.\nWords like \u2018good\u2019 can have a moral and a non-moral meaning: we don\u2019t use the word \u2018goodness\u2019 the\nsame way when we speak of good snow boots, and good people. With that in mind, which of the\nfollowing are moral statements, and which are not?\n- Peter should keep his promise to you.\n- Peter did keep his promise to you.\n- Human stem cell research is wrong.\n- Some people think that human stem cell research is wrong.\n- My mother is a good person.\n- My mother tries to be a good person.\n- This pasta dinner is really good.\n- Finish your dinner!\n- It\u2019s wrong to cheat on tests.\n- Information gathered from terror suspects via torture can\u2019t be trusted.\n- Torturing people suspected of terrorism is barbaric and criminal.\n1 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

This means that the conclusion is\na moral statement, and at least one of the premises is also a moral statement. As we saw in the\ndiscussion of deductions, nothing can appear in the conclusion that was not present somehow in at least\none of the premises. So, if you have a moral statement for a conclusion, you need a moral statement\nsomewhere in the argument as well. Without one, the argument is an instance of the Naturalistic Fallacy,\nand it\u2019s unsound. Consider these examples:\n(P1) It\u2019s wrong to steal candy from babies.\n(P2) Little Sonny-Poo-Poo is a baby.\n(C) Therefore, it\u2019s wrong to steal candy from Little Sonny-Poo-Poo.\nIn this example, P1 is a general claim about moral principles, and P2 is a factual statement.\nTogether, they lead us to the conclusion, which passes a moral judgment about the particular case\ndescribed in P2. So while it ultimately can be seen as valid, the truth of (P1) requires much further\ndefense.\n(P1) Jolts of electricity are very painful.\n(P2) Some of the prisoners have been interrogated using electric jolts.\n(C) It is wrong to torture people using electric jolts.\nIn this example, both P1 and P2 are both factual claims. But the conclusion is a moral statement.\nSince there\u2019s no moral statement among the premises, this argument is unsound. Now there might be an\nimplied, unstated general moral principle which says that it\u2019s wrong to inflict pain on people. And some\nreaders might unconsciously fill in that premise, and declare the argument sound that way. But\nremember, when examining an argument, the only things you can examine are what\u2019s actually in front of\nyou.\nLegal Reasoning2\nLegal reasoning, for our purposes, is actually quite simple. To employ legal reasoning means that within\nthe confines of the legal system, you use the logical methods we have employed to arrive at a conclusion\nof how to apply the law. So, if you want to figure out whether or not something is legal, you look to the\nrelevant laws, combine them using logic, and you have answer.\nHowever, nothing is always this simple. There are fallacies often committed with legal reasoning of two\nkinds:\n1) Whatever is right is legal, and whatever is wrong is illegal.\n2) Whatever is legal is right, and whatever is illegal is wrong.\nYou\u2019ll notice that these are all moral claims, and we are not entitled to make these claims. Indeed, we\ncan find examples that disprove each of these (it\u2019s right to steal medicine to save a life but it\u2019s not legal,\n2 Noah Levin, 2018, printed here under a CC BY license\n26 Legal Reasoning and Moral Reasoning 141 LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING\nit\u2019s wrong to cheat on your spouse but it\u2019s not illegal). However, in general, we do like the laws to\nmatch up with our moral reasonings. Whenever making any arguments, it\u2019s always important to\nunderstand the relevant laws and how they impact (for better or worse) the claims and conclusions you\nare making.\n26 Legal Reasoning and Moral Reasoning 142"
