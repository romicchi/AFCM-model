Organizational culture affects the way people and groups interact with\neach other, with clients, and with stakeholders. A strong culture is integral to long-term organizational sustainability and success, and one\nof management's primary responsibilities is to both define and communicate this sense of shared culture.\nThe process of ingraining culture into an organization is simply one of communicating and integrating a broad cultural framework\nthroughout the organizational process. Central to this process is ensuring that each and every employee both understands and aligns\nwith the values and direction of the broader organization. This creates a sense of community among employees and ensures that the\nbroader objectives and mission of the organization are clear.\nWhile there are a variety of cultural perspectives and many organizational elements within a culture, the initial process of instilling culture\nis relatively consistent from a managerial perspective. The creation of a given culture is often defined by management's strategy for\naddressing the following issues:\nThe paradigm: Management determines both the mission and vision of the organization and sets a groundwork for the values that\nemployees are expected to align with. Determining these factors and communicating them effectively are absolutely critical to\nsuccessfully instilling organizational culture.\nControl systems: An example of this may be an employee handbook where behavioral expectations are laid out explicitly (where possible)\nfor employees to read and understand.\nOrganizational structures: The choice of an organizational structure has enormous cultural implications for openness of communication,\norganization of resources, and flow of information.\nPower structures: Power and culture are often intertwined: the degree to which specific individuals are free (or not) to make decisions is\nindicative of the openness and fluidity of the organization.\nSymbols: All strong brands associate with symbols (think logos). These are not randomly selected: symbols show which specific facets of\nan organizational culture management considers most important.\nRituals and routines: Routines are strong behavior modifiers that significantly impact the culture of a given organization. A looser and\nmore open work environment (limited routines, high individual freedom) may create more innovation while heavily structured routines\nmay create more efficiency and predictability.\nStories and myths: Finally, stories are powerful communicators of culture. Walmart uses Sam Walton's founding as a powerful myth to\npromote efficiency and the desire to try new things and integrate various products and services. This is organizationally defining.\nCultural change in an organization: The feedback loop of\ncultural change in an organization involve people's intentions to\nenable, engage, encourage, and exemplify the new desired\nbehaviors; this in turn influences the frequency of behaviors.\nAfter enough reinforcement, those behaviors become the norm,\nwhich self-reinforces through increasing people's exemplification\nof those behaviors.\nOverall, managers must be aware of their role as cultural ambassadors and their responsibility in creating a context for successfully\ninstilling organizational culture. For example, promoting a strong authoritarian hierarchy and strong innovation would be an oversight in\nthe field of organizational culture from a management professional. Managers must be careful to instill the culture that is most conducive\nto both the strategy and objectives of the organization over the long term.\nCommunicating Organizational Culture\nManagement is tasked with both creating culture and accurately communicating it across the organization.\nLearning Objectives\nRecognize the role of management in communicating and teaching organizational culture to employees and subordinates.\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nCorporate culture is used to control, coordinate, and integrate company subsidiaries.\nThe role of the manager is essential to the successful communication of a given organizational culture because managers are figureheads\nand role models for how individuals in the organization should behave.\nOrganizations should strive for what is considered a \"healthy\" organizational culture to increase productivity, growth, efficiency, and to\nreduce counterproductive behavior and turnover of employees.\nKey Terms\norganization: A group of people or other legal entities with an explicit purpose and written rules.\nCorporate culture is used to control, coordinate, and integrate company subsidiaries. Culture runs deeper than this definition, however,\nbecause culture also represents the embedded values, traditions, beliefs, and behaviors of a given group. Culture is indicative not only of\nwhat individuals pursue and believe in, but also their behaviors, assumptions, and communications. As a result, culture is both complex to\ncreate and challenging to communicate and imbue within the organization.\nCommunicating Culture\nThe role of the manager is essential to the successful communication of a given organizational culture because managers are figureheads\nand role models for how individuals in the organization should behave. While it is too simplistic to say that culture is a top-down\ncommunicative process, there is relevance to the idea that culture generally begins with the founders of the organization and the values\nthey emphasize in the organizational growth and hiring process.\nOrganization triangle: This organization\ntriangle illustrates the idea that structure,\nprocess, and the people involved all\ncontribute to the culture of an organization.\nLeaders have a number of tools and strategies at their disposal to communicate culture. Some of the most critical of these are structure,\nhierarchy, mission and vision statements, employee handbooks, hiring processes, and employee training and initiation. With many diverse\ntools for communicating culture comes the challenge of aligning each perspective for consistency of message: for instance, the employee\ntraining program must emphasize the same values as the mission statement and must match the executive mandate for organizational\nstructure and design.\nCommunication is the core tool for managing this cultural integration, enabling executives to remind employees what the organization\nstands for and why it's important. Holding company-wide quarterly meetings to emphasize objectives and strategy and sending out\nemails with key successes and developmental challenges are great ways to keep the conversation going.\nThe Role of HR\nIt is also critical to make the hiring process match and promote the culture by hiring talent that is consistent with cultural expectations\nand implementing training programs that effectively emphasize what the organization stands for and why. Human resource professionals\nare tasked with identifying candidates with culturally consistent perspectives and with underlining the importance of cultural\nconsiderations in interviews and on-boarding processes.\nBuilding a Culture of High Performance\nA high-performing culture is a results-driven business culture focused on generating efficiency and completing objectives.\nLearning Objectives\nAnalyze the primary drivers and positive characteristics of a high-performing culture.\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nEvery business has its own culture. High- performance cultures are specifically focused on setting and accomplishing objectives with a\nhigh degree of efficiency and efficacy.\nHigh-performing teams are an integral component of high-performance cultures.\nA high-performing team is a group of people with complementary talents and skills. They are given clear roles and are committed to a\ncommon purpose. This enables synergy.\nCulture is a combination of individual perspectives and the environment in which they operate. Business looking to create a high-\nperformance culture must create an interdependent environment which empowers employee responsibility and decision -making.\nKey Terms\nSMART: Goal-setting criteria: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely.\nperforming: The stage of group development when the the team is able to function as a unit, finding ways to get the job done smoothly\nand effectively without inappropriate conflict or supervision.\nhigh-performing team: groups that are highly focused on their goals and that achieve superior business results.\nOrganizations need to be productive in order to achieve their goals. Over time, productivity can become a part of organizational culture,\neventually becoming integrated into the company's operations and processes. The business becomes known for its productivity, and high\nperformance becomes second-nature for its employees. A high-performing culture is defined by a focus on generating and accomplishing\nobjectives. There is a strong sense of both results-orientation and employee interdependence.\nA High-Performing team\nAn effective way to achieve high-performing culture is to create high-performing teams. A high-performing team is best defined as a\ngroup of interdependent employees whose skills and personalities complement one another and lead to above-average operational\nresults. High-performance teams are a central building block of high-performance culture, and they thrive in innovative and empowering\nenvironments.\nLeadership in any team environment is critical to success, but leadership within a high-performance culture is often complex. While\nleadership is normally static in a hierarchical environment, high-performance teams benefit from shared leadership by utilizing the\ndifferent talents and perspectives of each team member in the decision-making process. This creates a strong culture of shared leadership\nwhich in turn can generate above-average results and highly motivated employees who trust one another.\nCulture is defined by creating its own consciousness in an organization, indicating shared norms and values. These shared values are\ncentral elements of the organization, as they generate buy-in and dedication from employees. These shared values create an expectation\nof success, both professional and personal, that can create high levels of trust and shared accountability. In short, shared values are key to\ncreating strong team dynamics.\nThere are ten elements in particular that are important to successfully integrating high-performance teams within an organizational\nculture:\nParticipative leadership \u2013 Involve the entire team when making decisions, and rely on specialists only when applicable.\nEffective decision making \u2013 Ensure that decision-making is both strategic and efficient. Group decision-making is often slowed when team\ndynamics are weak, which requires team-building to fix.\nOpen and clear communication \u2013 As always with group dynamics, communication is key to success. Ensure everyone is speaking and\nlistening.\nValued diversity \u2013 Team synergy is lost when groupthink dominates the discussion. Instill open-mindedness and dispel social fears of\ndisagreeing.\nMutual trust \u2013 Reliance upon one another, and trust in each other's skills and capabilities, allows for less duplication of work and more\noverall synergy.\nManaging conflict \u2013 Conflict is inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing. Deal with it calmly and without personal biases or emotions. Let\nthe best ideas win.\nClear goals \u2013 SMART objectives are essential to high performance, just as understanding where one is going is essential to finding the\nbest route.\nDefined roles and responsibilities \u2013 Everyone should have a clear understanding of why they are on the team and what they are\nresponsible for.\nCoordinated relationships \u2013 Building strong team dynamics requires team members to understand each other and build strong\nrelationships. Utilize ice-breaking activities and promote casual discussion to get this started.\nPositive atmosphere \u2013 Wherever possible, make sure the general perspective is one of constructive commentary. Maintaining a positive\noutlook empowers communication and improves team spirit.\nNew York Yankees: A Great Team\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
