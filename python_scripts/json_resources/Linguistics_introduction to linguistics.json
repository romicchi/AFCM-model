Signs combine an exponent (a sequence\nofletters orsounds) withameaning. Grammarsareways togenerate\nsigns from more basic signs. Signs combine a form and a meaning,\nandtheyareidenticalwithneithertheirexponentnorwiththeirmean-\ning.\nBefore we start. I have tried to be as explicit as I could in preparing these notes.\nYou will find that some of the technicalities are demanding at first sight. Do\nnot panic! You are not expected to master these technicalities right away. The\ntechnical character is basically due to my desire to be as explicit and detailed as\npossible. For some of you this might actually be helpful. If you are not among\nthemyoumaywanttoreadsomeotherbookontheside(whichIencourageyouto\ndoanyway). However,linguisticsisgettingincreasinglyformalandmathematical,\nand you are well advised to get used to this style of doing science. So, if you do\nnot understand right away what I am saying, you will simply have to go over it\nagain and again. And keep asking questions! New words and technical terms\nthat are used for the first time are typed in bold-face. If you are supposed to\nknow what they mean, a definition will be given right away. The definition is\nvalidthroughouttheentirecourse,butbeawareofthefactthatotherpeoplemight\ndefine things differently. This applies when you read other books, for example.\nYou should beware of possible discrepancies in terminology. If you are not given\na definition elsewhere, be cautious. If you are given a different definition it does\n(cid:127)\nnot mean that the otherbooks get it wrong. The symbol in the margin signals\nsome material that is difficult, and optional. Such passages are put in for those\nwho want to get a perfect understanding of the material; but they are not requried\nknowledge.\n(Endofnote)\nLanguage is a means to communicate, it is a semiotic system. By that we\nsimply mean that it is a set of signs. Its A sign is a pair consisting\u2014in the words\nof Ferdinand de Saussure\u2014of a signifier and a signified. We prefer to call the\nsignifiertheexponentandthesignifiedthemeaning. Forexample,inEnglishthe\nstring /dog/ is a signifier, and its signified is, say, doghood, or the set of all dogs.\n(I use the slashes to enclose concrete signifiers, in this case sequences of letters.)\nSignsystemsareubiquitous: clocks,roadsigns,pictograms\u2014theyallarepartsof 4 Lecture1: Introduction\nsign systems. Language differs from them only in its complexity. This explains\nwhy language signs have much more internal structure than ordinary signs. For\nnotice that language allows to express virtually every thought that we have, and\nthe number of signs that we can produce is literally endless. Although one may\nfind it debatable whether or not language is actually infinite, it is clear that we\nare able to understand utterances that we have never heard before. Every year,\nhundreds of thousands of books appear, and clearly each of them is new. If it\nwere the same as a previously published book this would be considered a breach\nof copyright! However, no native speaker of the language experiences trouble\nunderstandingthem(apartfromtechnicalbooks).\nIt might be far fetched, though, to speak of an entire book as a sign. But\nnothing speaks against that. Linguists mostly study only signs that consist of just\nonesentence. Andthisis whatweshall dohere, too. However,texts arecertainly\nmore than a sequence of sentences, and the study of discourse (which includes\ntexts and dialogs) is certainly a very vital one. Unfortunately, even sentences are\nsocomplicatedthatitwilltakeallourtimetostudythem. Themethods,however,\nshallbeusefulfordiscourseanalysisaswell.\nIn linguistics, language signs are constituted of four different levels, not just\ntwo: phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Semantics deals with\nthe meanings (what is signified), while the other three are all concerned with the\nexponent. At the lowest level we find that everything is composed from a small\nset of sounds, or\u2014when we write\u2014of letters. (Chinese is exceptional in that the\nalphabetconsistsofaround50,000\u2018letters\u2019,buteachsignstandsforasyllable\u2014a\nsequence of sounds, not just a single one.) With some exceptions (for example\ntone and intonation) every utterance can be seen as a sequence of sounds. For\nexample, /dog/ consists of three letters (and three sounds): /d/, /o/ and /g/. In\norder not to confuse sounds (and sound sequences) with letters we denote the\nsounds by enclosing them in square brackets. So, the sounds that make up [dog]\nare [d], [o] and [g], in that order. What is important to note here is that sounds\nby themselves in general have no meaning. The decomposition into sounds has\nno counterpart in the semantics. Just as every signifier can be decomposed into\nsounds,itcanalsobedecomposedintowords. Inwrittenlanguagewecanspotthe\nwords by looking for minimal parts of texts enclosed by blanks (or punctuation\nmarks). In spoken language the definition of word becomes very tricky. The\npart of linguistics that deals with how words are put together into sentences is\ncalled syntax. On the other hand, words are not the smallest meaningful units of Lecture1: Introduction 5\nlanguage. For example, /dogs/ is the plural of /dog/ and as such it is formed by\na regular process, and if we only know the meaning of /dog/ we also know the\nmeaningof/dogs/. Thus,wecandecompose/dogs/intotwoparts: /dog/and/s/.\nThe minimal parts of speech that bear meaning are called morphemes. Often, it\nis tacitly assumed that a morpheme is a part of a word; bigger chunks are called\nidioms. Idioms are /kick the bucket/, /keep taps on someone/, and so on.\nThe reason for this division is that while idioms are intransparent as far as their\nmeaning is concerned (if you die you do not literally kick a bucket), syntactically\ntheyoftenbehaveasiftheyaremadefromwords(forexample,theyinflect: /John\nkicked the bucket/).\nSo, a word such as \u2018dogs\u2019 has four manifestations: its meaning, its sound\nstructure, its morphological structure and its syntactic structure. The levels of\nmanifestation are also called strata. (Some use the term level of representa-\ntion.) We use the following notation: the sign is given by enclosing the string in\nbrackets: \u2018dog\u2019. [dog] denotes its phonological structure, [dog] its morpholog-\nP M\nical structure, [dog] its syntactic structure and [dog] its semantical structure. I\nL S\nalso use typewriter font for symbols in print. For the most part we analyse lan-\nguageaswrittenlanguage,unlessotherwiseindicated. Withthatinmind,wehave\n[dog] = /dog/. The latter is a string composed from three symbols, /d/, /o/ and\nP\n/g/. So, \u2018dog\u2019 refers to the sign whose exponent is written here /dog/. We shall\nagreeonthefollowing.\nDefinition1 Asignisaquadrupleh\u03c0,\u00b5,\u03bb,\u03c3i,where\u03c0isitsexponent(orphono-\nlogical structure), \u00b5 its morphological structure, \u03bb its syntactic structure and \u03c3\nitsmeaning(orsemanticstructure).\nWewritesignsvertically,inthefollowingway.\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n\u03c3\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0 \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\u00b5\u03bb\n(1)\n\u03c0\nThis definition should not be taken as saying something deep.

Moreover,intheliteraturethereare 6 Lecture1: Introduction\nnumerous different definitions of signs. You should not worry too much here: the\npresent definition is valid throughout this book only.

A grammar consists of a set of signs\n(calledlexicon)togetherwithafinitesetoffunctionsthateachoperateonsigns.\nTypically, though not necessarily, the grammars that linguists design for natural\nlanguages consist in the lexicon plus a single binary operation \u2022 of merge. There\nmay also be additional operations (such as movement), but let\u2019s assume for the\nmoment that this is not so. Such a grammar is said to generate the following\nlanguage(=setofsigns) L:\n(cid:192) Eachmemberofthelexiconisin L.\n` IfS andS0 arein L,thensoisS \u2022S0.\n\u00b4 Nothingelseisin L. Lecture1: Introduction 7\n(Can you guess what a general definition would look like?) We shall now give\na glimpse of how the various representations look like and what these operations\nare. It will take the entire course (and much more) to understand the precise\nconsequences of Definitions 1 and 2 and the idea that operations are defined on\neach stratum independently. But it is a very useful one in that it forces us to be\nclear and concise. Everything has to be written into one of the representations in\norder to have an effect on the way in which signs combine and what the effect of\ncombinationis.\nFor example, (cid:13) is typically concatenation, with a blank added. Let us repre-\nP\nsentstringsby ~x,~yetc.,andconcatenationbya. So,\n(4) dacaxy = dacxy\n(5) adfa2axy = adf xy\nNotice that visually, 2 (\u2018blank\u2019) is not represented at the end of a word. In com-\nputer books one often uses the symbol (cid:23) to represent the blank. (Clearly, though\nthe symbol is different from the blank!) Blank is a symbol (on a typewriter you\nhavetopress space togetit. So,xa2isnot thesameasx! Nowwehave\n(6) ~x(cid:13)~y := ~xa2a ~y\nP\nFor example, the sign \u2018this year\u2019 is composed from the signs \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018year\u2019.\nAndwehave\n(7) this year = [thisyear] = [this] (cid:13)[year] = thisa2ayear\nP P P P\nThis, however, is valid only for words and only for written language. The com-\nposition of smaller units is different. No blank is inserted. For example, the sign\n\u2018car\u2019 the plural sign \u2018s\u2019 (to give it a name) compose to give the sign with expo-\nnent /cars/, not /car s/. Moreover, the plural of /man/ is /men/, so it is not at all\nformedbyadding/s/. Weshallseebelowhowthisisdealtwith.\nMorphology does not get to see the individual makeup of its units. In fact,\nthedifferencebetween\u2018car\u2019and\u2018cat\u2019ismorphologicallyspeakingasgreatasthat\nbetween\u2018car\u2019and\u2018moon\u2019. Also,botharesubjecttothesamemorphologicalrules\nand behave in the same way, for example form the plural by adding \u2018s\u2019. That\nmakes them belong to the same noun class. Still, they are counted as different\nmorphemes. Thisisbecausetheyaremanifesteddifferently(thesoundstructureis\ndifferent). Therefore we distinguish between a morpheme and its morphological 8 Lecture1: Introduction\nstructure. The latter is only the portion that is needed on the morphological\nstratumtogeteverythingright.\nDefinition3 Amorphemeisanindecomposablesign.\nA morpheme can only be defined relative to a grammar. If we have only \u2022, then\nS is a morpheme of there are no S0 and S00 with S = S0 \u2022 S00. (If you suspect\nthat essentially the lexicon may consist in all and only the morphemes, you are\nright. Though the lexicon may contain more elements, it cannot contain less.) A\nword is something that is enclosed by blanks and/or punctuation marks. So the\npunctuation marks show us that a morpheme is a word.

One may ask why it is at all necessary to distin-\nguishmorphologicalfromsyntacticrepresentation. Somelinguistssharplydivide 10 Lecture1: Introduction\nbetween lexical and syntactical operations. Lexical operations are those that op-\nerate on units below the level of words. So, the operation that combines \u2018car\u2019\nand plural is a lexical operation. The signs should have no manifestation on the\nsyntactical stratum, and so by definition, then, they should not be called signs.\nHowever, this would make the definition unnecessarily complicated. Moreover,\nlinguistsare notunanimous inrejecting syntacticrepresentations formorphemes,\nsinceitposesmoreproblemsthanitsolves(thiswillbequiteobviousforso-called\npolysynthetic languages). We shall not attempt to solve the problem here. Opin-\nions are quite diverse and most linguists do accept that there is a separate level of\nmorphology.\nAlastissuethatisofextremeimportanceinlinguisticsisthatofdeepandsur-\nface structure. Let us start with phonology. The sound corresponding to the letter\n/l/ differs from environment to environment (see Page 525 of Fromkin et. al.).\nThe \u2018l\u2019 in the pronunication of /slight/ is different from the \u2018l\u2019 in (the pronun-\nciation of) /listen/. If we pronounce /listen/ using the \u2018l\u2019 sound of /slight/\nwe get a markedly different result (it sounds a bit like Russian accent). So, one\nletter has different realizations, and the difference is recognized by the speakers.\nHowever, the difference between these sounds is redundant in the language. In\nfact, in written language they are represented by just one symbol. Thus, one dis-\ntinguishes a phone (= sound) from a phoneme (= set of sounds). While phones\nare language independent, phonemes are not. For example, the letter /p/ has two\ndistinct realizations, an aspirated and an unaspirated one. It is aspirated in /pot/\nbut unaspirated in /spit/. Hindi recognizes two distinct phonemes here. A sim-\nilar distinction exists in all other strata, though we shall only use the distinction\nbetween morph and morpheme. A morpheme is a set of morphs. For example,\nthe plural morpheme contains a number of morphs. One of them consists in the\nletter /s/, another in the letters /en/ (which are appended, as in /ox/:/oxen/), a\nthird is zero (/fish/:/fish/). And some more. The morphs of a morpheme are\ncalled allomorphs of each other. If a morpheme has several allomorphs, how do\nwe make sure that the correct kind of morph is applied in combination? For ex-\nample, why is the plural of /car/ not /caren/ or /car/? The answer lies in the\nmorphological representation. Indeed, we have proposed that morphological rep-\nresentations containinformation about wordclasses. Thismeans that fornouns it\ncontainsinformationaboutthekindofpluralmorphthatisallowedtoattachtoit.\nIf one looks carefully at the setup presented above, the distinction between deep\nandsurfacestratumishowevernonexistent. Thereisnodistinctionbetweenmor-\npheme and morph. Thus, either there are no morphs or there are no morphemes. Lecture1: Introduction 11\nBothoptionsaretheoreticallypossible.\nSome notes. The idea of stratification is implicit in many syntactic theories.\nThere are differences in how the strata look like and how many there are. Trans-\nformational grammar recognizes all four of the strata (they have been called\nLogicalForm(forthesemanticalstratum)S-structure(forsyntax)andPhonetic\nFormorPF(forphonologicalstratum). Morphologyhassometimesbeenconsid-\neredaseparate,lexicalstratum,althoughsometheories(forexampleDistributed\nMorphology) try to integrate it into the overall framework. Lexical Functional\nGrammar(LFG)distinguishesc(onstituent)-structure(=syntax),a(rgument)-\nstructure,f(unctional)-structureandm(orphological)-structure.\nThere has also been Stratificational Grammar, which basically investigated\nthe stratal architecture of language. The difference with the present setup is that\nStratificational Grammar assumes independent units at all strata. For example,\na morpheme is a citizen of the morphological stratum. The morpheme \u2018car\u2019 is\ndifferent from the morpheme \u2018cat\u2019, for example. Moreover, the lexeme \u2018car\u2019 is\nonce again different from the morpheme \u2018car\u2019, and so on. This multiplies the\nlinguistic ontology beyond need. Here we have defined a morpheme to be a sign\nof some sort, and so it has just a manifestation on all strata rather than belonging\nto any of them. That means that our representation shows no difference on the\nmorphologicalstratum,onlyonthesemanticalandthephonologicalstratum.\nAlternative Reading. I recommend [Fromkin, 2000] for alternative perspec-\ntive. Also[O\u2019Gradyetal.,2005]isworthwhilethoughlessexact. Lecture 2: Phonetics\nPhonetics is the study of sounds. To understand the mechanics of\nhumanlanguagesonehasto understandthephysiologyofthehuman\nbody. Letters represent sounds in a rather intricate way. This has\nadvantages and disadvantages. To represent sounds by letters in an\naccurate and uniform way the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\nwascreated.\nWe begin with phonology and phonetics. It is important to understand the differ-\nencebetweenphoneticsandphonology. Phoneticsisthestudyofactualsoundsof\nhuman languages, their production and their perception. It is relevant to linguis-\nticsforthesimplereasonthatthesoundsaretheprimaryphysicalmanifestationof\nlanguage. Phonology on the other hand is the study of sound systems. The differ-\nence is roughly speaking this. There are countless different sounds we can make,\nbut only some count as sounds of a language, say English. Moreover, as far as\nEnglishisconcerned,manyperceptiblydistinctsoundsarenotconsidered\u2018differ-\nent\u2019. The letter /p/, for example, can be pronounced in many different ways, with\nmore emphasis, with more loudness, with different voice onset time, and so on.\nFromaphoneticpointofview,thesearealldifferentsounds;fromaphonological\npointofviewthereisonlyone(English)sound,orphoneme: [p].\nThedifferenceisveryimportantthoughoftenenoughitisnotevidentwhether\na phenomenon is phonetic in nature or phonological. English, for example, has\na basic sound [t]. While from a phonological point of view there is only one\nphoneme [t], there are infinitely many actual sounds that realize this phoneme.\nSo, while there are infinitely many different sounds for any given language there\nare only finitely many phonemes, and the upper limit is around 120. English has\n40 (see Table 7). The difference can be illustrated also with music. There is a\ncontinuum of pitches, but the piano has only 88 keys, so you can produce only\n88 different pitches. The chords of the piano are given, so that the basic sound\ncolour and pitch cannot be altered. But you can still manipulate the loudness,\nfor example. Sheet music reflects this state of affairs in the same way as written\nlanguage. Themusicalsoundsaredescribedbydiscretesigns,thekeys. Returning\nnowtolanguage: thedifferencebetweenvariousdifferentrealizationsoftheletter\n/t/, for example, are negligeable in English and often enough we cannot even tell\nthe difference between them. Still, if we recorded the sounds and mapped them\nout in a spectrogram we could actually see the difference. (Spectrograms are one Lecture2: Phonetics 13\nTable1: Theletter/x/invariouslanguages\nLanguage Value\nAlbanian [dZ]\nBasque [x]\nEnglish [gz]\nFrench [gz]\nGerman [ks]\nPortuguese [S]\nSpanish [\u00e7]\nPinyinofMandarin [C]\nimportant instrument in phonetics because they visualize sounds so that you can\nsee what you often even cannot hear.) Other languages cut the sound continuum\nin a different way. Not all realizations of /t/ in English sound good in French,\nfor example. Basically, French speakers pronounce /t/ without aspiration. This\nmeans that if we think of the sounds as forming a \u2018space\u2019 the so-called basic\nsounds of a language occupy some region of that space. These regions vary from\nonelanguagetoanother.\nLanguages are written in alphabets, and many use the Latin alphabet. It turns\nout that not only is the Latin alphabet not always suitable for other languages,\northographies are often not a reliable source for pronunciation. English is a case\ninpoint. Toillustratetheproblems,letuslookatthefollowingtables(takenfrom\n[Coulmas, 2003]). Table 1 concerns the values of the letter /x/ in different lan-\nguages: As one can see, the correspondence between letters and sounds is not\nat all uniform. On the other hand, even in one and the same language the cor-\nrespondence can be nonuniform. Table 2 lists ways to represent [@] is English\nby letters. Basically any of the vowel letters can represent [@]. This mismatch\nhas various reasons, a particular one being language change and dialectal differ-\nence. The sounds of a language change slowly over time. If we could hear a\ntape recording of English spoken, say, one or two hundred years ago in one and\nthe same region, we would surely notice a difference. The orthography however\ntends to be conservative. The good side about a stable writing system is that we\ncan(inprinciple)readoldertextsevenifwedonotknowhowtopronouncethem.\nSecond, languages with strong dialectal variation often fix writing according to 14 Lecture2: Phonetics\nTable2: Thesound[@]inEnglish\nLetter Example\na about\ne believe\ni compatible\no oblige\nu circus\none of the dialects. Once again this means that documents are understood across\ndialects,eventhoughtheyarereadoutdifferently.\nI should point out here that there is no unique pronunciation of any letter in\na language. More often than not it has quite distinct vaues. For example, the\nletter /p/ sounds quite different in /photo/ as it does in /plus/. In fact, the sound\ndescribed by /ph/ is the same as the one normally described by /f/ (for example\nin /flood/). The situation is that we nevertheless ascribe a \u2018normal\u2019 value to a\nletter (which we use when pronouncing the letter in isolation or in reciting the\nalphabet). This connection is learned in school and is part of the writing system,\nby which I mean more than just the rendering of words into sequences of letters.\nNotice a curious fact here. The letter /b/ is pronounced like /bee/ in English,\nwith a subsequent vowel that is not part of the value of the letter. In Sanskrit, the\nprimitiveconsonantallettersrepresenttheconsonantplus[a],whiletherecitation\nof the letter is nowadays done without it. For example, the letter for \u201cb\u201d has\nvalue [b@] when used ordinarily, while it is recited [b]. If one does not want a\npronunciationwithschwa,theletterisaugmentedbyastroke.\nIn the sequel I shall often refer to the pronunciation of a letter; by that I mean\nthe standard value assigned to it in reciting the alphabet, however without the\nadded vowel. This recipe is, I hope, reasonably clear, though it has shortcomings\n(therecitationof/w/revealslittleoftheactualsoundvalue).\nThe disadvantage for the linguist is that the standard orthographies have to be\nlearned (if you study many different languages this can be a big impediment) and\nsecond they do not reveal what is nevertheless important: the sound quality. For\nthatreasononehasagreedonaspecialalphabet,theso-calledInternationalPho-\nnetic Alphabet (IPA). In principle this alphabet is designed to give an accurate Lecture2: Phonetics 15\nwritten transcription of sounds, one that is uniform for all languages. Since the\nIPAisaninternationalstandard,itisvitalthatoneunderstandshowitworks(and\ncan read or write using it). The complete set of symbols is rather complex, but\nluckilyonedoesnothavetoknowallofit.\nThe Analysis of Speech Sounds\nFirst of all, the continuum of speech is broken up into a sequence of discrete\nunits,whichwereferredtoassounds. Thusweareanalysinglanguageutterances\nas sequences of sounds. Right away we mention that there is an exception. Into-\nnation and stress are an exception to this. The sentences below are distinct only\ninintonation(fallingpitchversusfallingandrisingpitch).\n(14) You spoke with the manager.\n(15) You spoke with the manager?\nAlso, the word /protest/ has two different pronunciations; when it is a noun the\nstress is on the first syllable, when it is a verb it is on the second. Stress and\nintonation obviously affect the way in which the sounds are produced (changing\nloudness and / or pitch), but in terms of decomposition of an utterance into seg-\nments intonation and stress have to be taken apart. We shall return to stress later.\nSuffice it to say that in IPA stress is marked not on the vowel but on the syllable\n(by a [\"] before the stressed syllable), since it is though to be a property of the\nsyllable. Tone is considered to be a suprasegmental feature, too. It does not play\na role in European languages, but for example in languages of South East Asia\n(includingChineseandVietnamese),inlanguagesofAfricaandNativeAmerican\nlanguages. Weshallnotdealwithtone.\nSounds are produced in the vocal tract. Air is flowing through the mouth and\nnose and the characteristics of the sounds are manipulated by several so-called\narticulators. A rough picture is that the mouth aperture is changed by moving\nthe jaw, and that the shape of the cavity can be manipulated by the tongue in\nmany ways. The parts of the body that are involved in shaping the sound, the\narticulators,canbeactive(inwhichcasetheymove)orpassive. Thearticulators\nare as follows: oral cavity, upper lip, lower lip, upper teeth, alveolar ridge\n(the section of the mouth just behind the upper teeth stretching to the \u2018corner\u2019),\ntongue tip, tongue blade (the flexible part of the tongue), tongue body, tongue 16 Lecture2: Phonetics\nTable3: IPAconsonantcolumnlabels\nArticulatorsinvolved\nbilabial thetwolips,bothactiveandpassive\nlabiodental activelowerliptopassiveupperteeth\ndental activetonguetip/bladetopassiveupperteeth\nalveolar activetonguetip/bladetopassivefrontpartofalveolar\nridge\npostalveolar activetonguebladetopassivebehindalveolar\nretroflex active tongue tip raised or curled to passive postalve-\nolar (difference between postalveolar and retroflex:\nbladevs. tip)\npalatal tongueblade/bodyto hardpalatebehind entirealveo-\nlarridge\nvelar active body of tongue to passive soft palate (some-\ntimestobackofsoftpalate)\nuvular activebodyoftonguetopassive(oractive)uvula\npharyngeal activebody/rootoftonguetopassivepharynx\nglottal bothvocalchords,bothactiveandpassive\nroot, epiglottis (the leaf-like appendage to the tongue in the pharynx), pharynx\n(thebackverticalspaceofthevocaltract,betweenuvulaandlarynx),hardpalate\n(upper part of the mouth just above the tongue body in normal position), soft\npalateorvelum(thesoftpartofthemouthabovethetongue,justbehindthehard\npalate), uvula (the hanging part of the soft palate), and larynx (the part housing\nthe vocal chords).

Table3givessomedefinitionsofpho-\nnetic features in terms of articulators for consonants. Column labels here refer to\nwhatdefinestheplaceofarticulationasopposedtothemannerofarticulation.\nThe degree of constriction is roughly the distance of the active articulator to the\npassive articulator. The degree of constriction plays less of a role in consonants,\nthough it does vary, say, between full contact [d] and \u2018close encounter\u2019 [z], and Lecture2: Phonetics 17\nTable4: Constrictiondegreesforconsonants\nstop active and passive articulators touch an hold-to-seal\n(permittingnoflowofairoutofthemouth)\ntrill activearticulatorvibratesasairflowsaroundit\ntap/flap active and passive articulators touch but don\u2019t hold\n(includesquicktouchandfastsliding)\nfricative active and passive articulators form a small constric-\ntion,creatinganarrowgapcausingnoiseasairpasses\nthroughit\napproximant active and passive articulators form a large constric-\ntion, allowing almost free flow of air through the vo-\ncaltract\nit certainly varies during the articulation (for example in affricates [dz] where the\ntongue retreats in a slower fashion than with [d]). The manner of articulation\ncombines the degree of constriction together with the way it changes in time. Ta-\nble 4 gives an overview of the main terms used in the IPA and Table 5 identifies\nthe row labels of the IPA chart. Vowels differ from consonants in that there is\nno constriction of air flow. The notions of active and passive articulator apply.\nHere we find at least four degrees of constriction (close, close-mid, open-mid\nand open), corresponding to the height of the tongue body (plus degree of mouth\naperture). There is a second dimension for the horizontal position of the tongue\nbody. The combination of these two parameters is often given in the form of a\ntwo dimensional trapezoid, which shows with more accuracy the position of the\ntongue. There is a third dimension, which defines the rounding (round versus\nunrounded,whichisusuallynotmarked). Weaddafourthdimension,nasalver-\nsusnonnasal,dependingonwhethertheairflowspartlythroughthenoseoronly\nthroughthemouth.\nNaming the Sounds\nThe way to name a sound is by stringing together its attributes. However, there is\nadistinctionbetweennamingvowelsandconsonants. Firstwedescribethenames\nof consonants. For example, [p] is described as a voiceless, bilabial stop, [m] is 18 Lecture2: Phonetics\nTable5: IPAconsonantrowlabels\nplosive apulmonic-egressive,oralstop\nnasal apulmonic-egressivestopwithanasalflow;notaplo-\nsive,becausenotoral\nfricative a sound with fricative constriction degree; implies\nthatairflowiscentral\nlateralfricative africativeinwhichtheairflowislateral\napproximant a sound with approximant constriction degree; im-\npliesthattheairflowiscentral\nlateral approxi- anapproximantinwhichtheairflowislateral\nmant\nTable6: IPAvowelrowandcolumnlabels\nclose comparedwithothervowels,overallheightoftongue\nis greatest; tongue is closest to roof of mouth (also:\nhigh)\nopen compared with other vowels, overall height of mouth\nisleast;mouthismostopen(also: low)\nclose-mid,open-mid intermediate positions (also: mid / uppermid / lower-\nmid)\nfront compared with other vowels, tongue is overall for-\nward\ncentral intermediateposition\nback compared with other vowels, tongue is overall back\n(nearpharynx)\nrounded lipsareconstrictedinwardandprotrudedforward Lecture2: Phonetics 19\ncalleda(voiced)bilabialnasal.

The additional specification \u2018aspirated\u2019 is a\nmanner attribute, so it is put after the place description (but before the attribute\n\u2018stop\u2019, since the latter is a noun). For example, the sequence \u2018voiced retroflex\nfricative\u2019refersto[(cid:252)],ascanbeseenfromtheIPAchart.\nVowels on the other hand are always described as \u2018vowels\u2019, and all the other\nfeatures are attributes.

Ifnothingissaid,thevowelisnotnasal.\nOn Strict Transcription\nSince IPA tries to symbolize a sound with precision, there is a tension between\naccuracy and usefulness. As we shall see later, the way a phoneme is realized\nchanges from environment to environment. Some of these changes are so small\nthat one needs a trained ear to even hear them. The question is whether we want\nthe difference to show up in the notation. At first glance the answer seems to be\nnegative. Buttwoproblemsarise: (a)linguistssometimesdowanttorepresentthe\ndifference and there should be a way to do that, and (b) a contrast that speakers\nof one language do not even hear might turn out to be distinctive and relevant\nin another. (An example is the difference between English [d] (alveolar) and a\nsound where the tongue is put between the teeth (dental). Some languages in\nIndia distinguish these sounds, though I hardly hear a difference.) Thus, on the\none hand we need an alphabet that is highly flexible on the other we do not want\nto use it always in full glory. This motivates using various systems of notation,\nwhichdiffermainlyinaccuracy. Table7givesyoualistofEnglishspeechsounds\nand a phonetic symbol that is exact insofar that knowing the IPA would tell an\nEnglish speaker exactly what sound is meant by what symbol. (I draw attention\nhowever to the sound [a], which according to the IPA is not used in American\nEnglish; instead, we find [A].) This is called broad transcription. The dangers 20 Lecture2: Phonetics\nof broad transcription are that a symbol like [p] does not reveal exact details of\nwhichsoundsfallunderit,itmerelytellsusthatwehaveavoicelessbilabialstop.\nSinceFrenchbroadtranscriptionmightusethesamesymbol[p]forthatwemight\nbetemptedtoconcludethattheyarethesame. Buttheyarenot.\nThus in addition to broad transcription there exists strict or narrow transcrip-\ntion, which consists in adding more information (say, whether [p] is pronounced\nwith aspiration or not).

More-\nover, we show how the formalism of attribute value structures offers\na succinct way of describing phonemes and phoneme classes. A nat-\nural class is one which can be described by a single attribute value\nstructure.\nDistinctiveness\nThere is a continuum of sounds but there is only a very limited set of distinctions\nthat we look out for. It is the same with letters: although you can write them in\nmany different ways most differences do not matter at all. There are hundreds\nof different fonts for example, but whether you write the letter \u2018a\u2019 like this: a or\nlikethis: \uf761,itusuallymakesnodifference. Similarly,somephoneticcontrastsare\nrelevant others are not. The question is: what do we mean by relevance? The\nanswer is: if the contrast makes a difference in meaning it is relevant. The easiest\ntest is to find to words that mean different things but differ only in one sound.\nThese are called minimal pairs. Table 8 shows some examples of minimal pairs.\nWe see from the first pair that the change from [h] to [k] may induces a change\nin meaning. Thus the contrast is relevant. In order for this to be meaningful at all\nwe should spell out a few assumptions. The first assumption, established in the\nlast section, is that the sound stream is segmentable into unique and identifiable\nunits. Thesoundstreamofanutteranceof/hat/willthusconsistofthreesounds,\nwhich I write as [h], [\u00e6] and [t]. Similarly, the sound stream of an utterance of\n/cat/ consists of three sounds, [k], [\u00e6] and [t]. The next assumption is that the\ntwo sequences are of equal length, which allows us to align the particular sounds\nwitheachother:\nh \u00e6 t\n(18) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nk \u00e6 t\nAndthethirdassumptionisthatwecanactually\u2018exchange\u2019particularoccurrences\nofsoundsinthestream. (Technically,onecandothisnowadaysbyusingsoftware\nallowing at manipulate any parts of a spectrogram. From an articulatory point\nof view, exchanging exact sounds one by one is impossible because of adapta-\ntionsmadebythesurroundingsounds. Therealisationof[\u00e6]willinlikelihoodbe Lecture3: PhonologyI 25\nslightly different whether it is preceded by [h] or by [k].) Given all this, we de-\nclare the sound stream to be a minimal pair just in case they have different mean-\ning. Clearly, whether they do or not is part of what the language is; recall that a\nlanguageisarelationbetweenexponents(here: soundstreams)andmeanings.\nDefinition4(MinimalPair) Twosoundstreamsformaminimalpair,iftheirseg-\nmentations are of the same length, and one can be obtained from the other by\nexchaning just one sound for another, and that the change results in a change of\nmeaning.\nIt is to be stressed that minimal pairs consist of two entire words, not just single\nsounds(unlessofcoursethesesoundsarewords). Ishouldemphasisethatbythis\ndefinition,fortwowordstobeminimalpairtheymustbeofequallengthinterms\nof how many basic sounds constitute them, not in terms of how many alphabetic\ncharactersareneededtowritethem. Thisisbecausewewanttoestablishtheunits\nofspeech,notofwriting. Thesamelengthisimportantforapurelyformalreason:\nwe want to be sure that we correctly associate the sounds with each other.

(c) shows that the contrast [\u00e6]:[2] is relevant, and so on. Many of\nthe contrasts between the 40 or so basic sounds of English can be demonstrated\nto be relevant by just choosing two words that are minimally different in that one\nhas one sound and the other has the other sound. (Although this would require to\nestablish(40\u00d739)/2=780minimalpairs,oneisusuallycontentwithfarless.) Let\nusnotealsothatinEnglishcertainsoundsjustdonotexist.

Thus we\nmaysaythatEnglishusesonlysomeoftheavailablesounds,andotherlanguages\nuse others (there are languages that have retroflex consonants, for example many\nlanguagesspokeninIndia). Additionally,thesetofEnglishsoundsisdividedinto\n40 groups, each corresponding to one letter in Table 7. These groups are called\nphonemes (and correspond to the 40 letters used in the broad transcription). The\nletter \u2018l\u2019 for example pretty much corresponds to a phoneme of English, which in\nturn is realized by many distinct sounds. The IPA actually allows to represent the 26 Lecture3: PhonologyI\nTable8: SomeMinimalPairsinEnglish\n(a) hat [h\u00e6t] : cat [kh\u00e6t]\n(b) cat [kh\u00e6t] : cap [kh\u00e6p]\n(c) cap [kh\u00e6p] : cup [kh2p]\n(d) flight [fla\u0131t] : fright [f(cid:244)a\u0131t]\n(e) flight [fla\u0131t] : plight [pla\u0131t]\ndifferentsoundstosomedegree:\n>\nfile [\"fa\u0131\u00ba] slight [\"sllait] wealth [\"wE(cid:17)\u00baT] listen [\"lis@n]\n(cid:6)>\n(19) fool [\"fu\u00ba] flight [\"fllait] health [\"hE(cid:17)\u00baT] lose [\"luz]\n>(cid:6)\nall [\"a\u00ba] plow [\"pllaU] filthy [\"f\u0131(cid:17)\u00baTi] allow [@\"laU]\n(cid:6)\n>\nThephonemethereforecontainsthe\u2018sounds\u2019[\u00ba],[ll],[(cid:17)l]and[l].

Theslantedbrackets\ndenotephonemesnotsounds,butthesoundsareneverthelessgiveninIPA.Onthe\nwhole, the classification of phonemes looks very similar to that of sounds. But\nthere are mismatches. There is a series of sounds, called affricates, which are\nwritten as a combination of a stop followed by a fricative: English has two such\nphonemes, [tS] and [dZ]. Similarly, diphthongs, which are written like sequences\nofvowelsorofvowelandglide,areconsideredjustonephoneme. Noticealsothat\nthe broad transcription is also hiding some diphthongs, like [e] as in /able/. This\nisa sequenceof thevowel [e]and theglide [j]. The reasonis thatthe vowel[e] is\nobligatorilyfollowedby[j]andthereforementioningof[j]isneedless. (However,\nunless you know English well you need to be told this fact.) The sequence [a\u0131] is\ndifferentinthat[a]isnotnecessarilyfollowed[\u0131],whencewritingthesequenceis\nunavoidable. 28 Lecture3: PhonologyI\nSome Concerns in Defining a Phoneme\nSowhileaphoneisjustasound,aconcrete,linearlyindecomposablesound(with\nthe exception of certain diphthongs and affricates), a phoneme on the other hand\nis a set of sounds. Recall that in the book a phoneme is defined to be a basic\nspeech sound. It is claimed, for example, that in Maasai [p], [b] and [B] are in\ncomplementary distribution. Nevertheless Maasai is said to have a phoneme /p/,\nwhosefeaturespecificationisthatof[p]. Thismeansamongotherthatitcanonly\nbe pronounced as [p]. This view has its justification. However, the theoretical\njustification is extremely difficult. There is no reason to prefer one of the sounds\novertheother. Bycontrastwedefinethefollowing.

Anotherwordforenvironmentiscontext.\nSo, if a and b belong to the same phoneme, then either in a given word (or\ntext) containing a one cannot substitute b for a, or one can but the result has the\nsame meaning; and in a text containing b somewhere either one cannot substitute\na for b or one can and the result has the same meaning. Take the sounds [t]\nand [R] in (American) English (see Page 529 of [Fromkin, 2000]). They are in\ncomplementary distribution, that is, in a context ~x ~y at most one of them can\nappear. So, we have [\"dej R@] but not [\"dejt@] (the context is \"dej @). (The second\nsounds British.) On the other hand we have [\"t\u00e6n] but not [\"R\u00e6n] (the context\nis \" \u00e6n). (Notice that to pronounce /data/ [\"dejt@] or even [\"dejth@] is actually\nnot illegitimate; this is the British pronunciation, and it is understood though not\nsaid. The meaning attributed to this string is just the same. The complications\narising from the distinction between how something is pronounced correctly and\nhow much variation is tolerated shall not be dealt with here.) On the other hand,\nifwechangethepositionofthetongueslightly(producing,say[(cid:17)t]inplaceof[t]),\nthe resulting string is judged to be the same. Hence it also means the same.

Thiscanvaryfromcontexttocontext,though. Lecture3: PhonologyI 29\nDefinition6(Phoneme) If L is a language, and p a specific sound then /p/\nL\ndenotesthephonemecontaining pin L.\nThedefinitionin[Fromkin,2000]ofaphonemeasoneofthebasicspeechsounds\nof a language is different from ours. So it needs comment why we do it differ-\nently. First, it needs to be established what a basic speech sound is. For example,\nin Maasai [p] and [B] are in complementary distribution. By our definition, the\nsounds instantiating either [p] or [B] all belong to the same Maasai phoneme,\nwhich we denote by /p/ . But is /p/ a basic speech sound? How can we\nMaasai Maasai\nknow? It seems that Fromkin et al. do not believe that it is. They take instead the\nphoneme to be[p], and assume that thecontext distorts the realization. Now look\nat English. The sound [p] is sometimes pronounced with aspiration and some-\ntimes not. The two realizations of the letter /p/, [p] and [ph] do not belong to the\nsame phoneme in Hindi. If this is the case it is difficult to support the idea that\n/p/ can be basic. If we look carefully at the definition above, it involves also\nEnglish\nthenotionofmeaning. Indeed,ifweassumethataword,say/car/,hasendlessly\nmany realizations, the only way to tell that we produced something that is not\na realization of /car/ is to establish that it does not mean what a realization of\n/car/ means. Part of the problem derives from the notation [p], which suggests\nthat it is clear what we mean. But it is known that the more distinctions a lan-\nguage makes in some dimension, the narrower defined the basic speech sounds\nare. English, for example, has only two bilabial stops, which we may write [p]\nand [b]. Sanskrit (and many languages spoken in India today) had four: [p], [ph],\n[b] and [bh]. There is thus every reason to believe that the class of sounds that\npass for a \u2018p\u2019 in English is dissimilar to that in Sanskrit (or Hindi or Thai, which\nare similar in this respect). Thus, to be perfect we should write [p] , [p]\nEnglish Sanskrit\nand so on. Indeed, the crucial parameter that distinguishes all these sounds, the\nVoice Onset Time is a continuous parameter. (The VOT is the delay of the onset\nofvoicingaftertheairstreamrelease. Thelargeritisthemoreofanaspirationwe\nhear.) The distinction that is binary on the abstract level turns out to be based on\na continuum which is sliced up in a somewhat arbitrary way. The discussion also\nhas to do with the problem of narrow versus wide transcription. When we write\n[p] we mean something different for English than for Hindi, because it would be\nincorrect to transcribe for a Hindi speaker the sound that realizes /p/ in /pal/ by\n[p];weshoulduse[ph]instead. 30 Lecture3: PhonologyI\nFeatures\nBy definition, any set of sounds can constitute a phoneme. However, it turns out\nthat phonemes are constituted by classes of sounds that have certain properties in\ncommon. These are defined by features. Features are phonetic, and supposed to\nbe not subject to cross-language variation. What exactly is a feature? The actual\nfeatures found in the literature take a (more or less) articulatory standpoint. Take\nany sound realizing English /b/. It is produced by closing the lips, thereby ob-\nstructingtheairflow(\u2018bilabial\u2019)andthenreleasingit,andatthesametimeletting\nthe vocal cords vibrate (\u2018voiced\u2019). If the vocal cords do not vibrate we get the\nsound corresponding to /p/. We can analyse the sound as a motor program that is\nexecuted on demand. Its execution is not totally fixed, so variation is possible (as\nit occurs with all kinds of movements that we perform). Second, the motor pro-\ngramdirectsvariouspartsofthevocaltracts,someofwhichareindependentfrom\neachother. Wemayseethisasamusicscorewhichhasvariouspartsfordifferent\n\u2018instruments\u2019.

We have to be a bit cautious, though. It is\nknown, for example, that /b/ is not pronounced with immediate voicing. Rather,\nthe voicing is delayed by a certain onset time. This onset time varies from lan-\nguage to language. Hence, the actual realization of a feature is different across\nlanguages,afactthatisratherawkwardfortheideathatphonemesaredefinedby\nrecoursetophoneticfeatures. Thelattershouldnamely belanguageindependent.\nThe problem just mentioned can of course be resolved by making finer distinc-\ntions with the features. But the question remains: just how much detail do the\nphonetic features need to give?

First and foremost\nthe features encode a certain linguistic reality; the features that we have spoken\nabout so far have phonetic content. They speak about articulatory properties. It\nso happens that many rules can be motivated from the fact that the vocal tract\nhas certain properties. For example, in German the final consonants of words (to\nbe exact, of syllables) are all voiceless (see the discussion on Page 49). This is\nso even when there is reason to believe that the consonant in question has been\nobtained from a voiced consonant. Thus, one proposes a rule of devoicing for\nGerman. However, it would be unexpected if this rule would turn [g] into [t]. We\nwould rather expect the rule to turn [g] into [k], [b] into [p] and [d] into [t]. The\nquestionsthatariseareasfollows:\n(cid:192) Whyisitthatweexpectmatterstobethisway?\n` Howcanweaccountforthechange?\nThe first question is answered as follows: the underlying rule is not a rule that\noperates with a lookup table, showing us what consonant is changed into what\notherconsonant. Rather,itisencodedasarulethatsays: simplyremovethevoic-\ning. For this to make sense we need to be able to independently control voicing.\nThis is clearly the case. However, it is one thing to observe that this is techni-\ncally possible and another to show that this is effectively the rule that speakers\nuse. OnewaytocheckthatthisiseffectivelytheruleistomakeGermansspeaka\ndifferentlanguage. Thenewlanguagewillhavenewsounds,butweshallobserve\nGermans still devoice them at the end of the word. (You can hear them do this\nin English, for example. The prediction is this that\u2014if they can at all produce\nthese sounds\u2014at the end of a word [\u00f0] will come out as [T].)

Theunderscore\nshows where the left part of the rule must be situated (and where the right part\nwill be substituted in its place). Here, it says: it must occur right before #, which\nsignals the end of a word. The way this rule operates needs to be explained. The\nGerman word /grob/ is pronounced [gGo:p] (the colon indicates a long vowel; G\nis a voiced velar fricative, the fricative equivalent of g). The letter /b/ however\nindicates an underlying [b].

Itisnotenoughtosaythat\nthe voiced consonants are transformed into the voiceless ones; we need to know\nwhich voiceless consonant will replace which voiced consonant. The tie between\n[p] and [b], between [k] and [g] and so on needs to be established. Because fea-\ntures have an independent motivation the correspondence is specified uniformly 34 Lecture3: PhonologyI\nforallsounds(\u2018voice\u2019referstothefactwhetherornotthevocalcordsvibrate). As\nwillbenotedthroughoutthiscourse,somerulesarenotreallyspecifictoonelan-\nguage but a whole group of them (final devoicing is a case in point). This seems\nto be contradictory, because the rules are stated using phonemes, and phonemes\nare language dependent, as we have seen. However, this need not be what is in\nfact goingon. Thefact thatlanguage hasa contrastbetween voicedand voiceless\nis independent of the exact specification of what counts, say, as a voiced bilabial\nstop as opposed to a voiceless bilabial stop. Important is that the contrast exists\nandisoneofvoicing.\nFor example, Hungarian, Turkish and Finnish both have a rule called vowel\nharmony. Modulo some difficulties all rules agree that words cannot both con-\ntain a back vowel and a front vowel. On the other hand, the front close-mid\nroundedvowelofFinnish(written/\u00f6/)ispronouncedwithmoreliproundingthan\ntheHungarianone(alsowritten/\u00f6/). Nevertheless,bothlanguagessystematically\noppose /\u00f6/ with /o/, which differs in the position of the tongue body (close-mid\nback rounded vowel). The situation is complicated through the fact that Hungar-\nianlongandshortvowelsdonotonlycontrastinlengthbutalsoinafeaturethatis\ncalled tension.

Lecture3: PhonologyI 35\nThis is still not as clear as I would like this to be. First, we need to something\nabout the classification system used above. Let P be our set of phonemes. Recall\nthat this set is in a way abstract. It is not possible to compare phonemes across\nlanguages,exceptbylookingattheirpossiblerealisations(whicharethensounds).\nWethendefine(usingourtheoreticalorpretheoreticalinsights)somefeaturesand\npotential values for them. Next we specify which sounds have which value to\nwhich attribute. That is to say, for each attribute A and value v there is a set of\nphonemes written [A : v] (which is therefore a subset of P). Its members are\nthe phonemes that are said to have the value v to the attribute A. This set must be\ngivenforeachsuchlegitimatepair.

The last\ncondition is especially important. It says that the classification system must be\nexhaustive. If two phonemes are different we ought to find something that sets\nit apart from the other phonemes. This means among other that for each p the\nsingleton{p}willbeanaturalclass.\nFirst,noticethatwerequireeachsoundtohaveavalueforagivenfeature. This\nis a convenient requirement because it eliminates some fuzziness in the presenta-\ntion. You will notice, for example, that vowels are classed along totally different\nlines as consonants.

This has two reasons. One is that it makes the calculations even more\ndifficult. The other is that it turns out that the classification of vowels proceeds\nalong different features. We have, for example, the feature \uf772\uf76f\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf764, but do not\nclassifiy the consonants according to feature. If we are strict about the execution\nof the classification we should then also say which of the consonants are rounded\nandwhichonesarenot.\nNotice also that the system of classification is motivated from the phonetics\nbut not entirely. There are interesting questions that appear. For example, the\nphoneme / (cid:244)/ is classified as voiced. However, at closer look it turns out that the\nphonemecontainsboththevoicedandthevoicelessvariant,written[(cid:244)]. (Thepro-\nnunciation of /bridge/ involves the voiced [(cid:244)], the pronunciation of(cid:6)/trust/ the\nvoiceless [(cid:244)].) In broad transcription (which is essentially phonemic) one writes\n(cid:6)\n[(cid:244)] regardless. But we need to understand that the term \u2018voiced\u2019 does not have\nits usual phonetic meaning. The policy on notation is not always consistently ad-\nhered to; the symbolism encourages confusing [(cid:244)] and [(cid:244)], though if one reads\n(cid:6)\nthe IPA manual it states that [(cid:244)] signifies only the voiced and not the voiceless\napproximant. So, technically, the left part of that cell should contain the symbol\n[(cid:244)].\n(cid:6)\nBinarism\nThe preceding section must have cautioned you to think that for a given set of\nphonemes there must be several possible classification systems. Indeed, not only\nare there several conceivable classification systems, phonologists are divided in\ntheissueofwhichonetoactuallyuse.\nThereisaneverconcludeddebateonthethesisofbinarismoffeatures. Bina-\nrismisthethesisthatfeatureshavejusttwovalues: +and\u2212. Inthiscase,alsoan\nalternative notation is used; instead of [att : +] one writes [+att] (for example,\n[+voiced]) and instead of [att : -] one writes [\u2212att] (for example [\u2212voiced]). I\nshallusethisnotationaswell.\nAlthough any feature system can be reconstructed using binary valued fea-\ntures,thetwosystemsarenotequivalent,sincetheydefinedifferentnaturalclasses.\nConsider, by way of example, the sounds [p], [t] and [k]. They are distinct Lecture3: PhonologyI 39\nonly in the place of articulation (bilabial versus alveolar versus velar). The only\nnatural classes are: the empty one, the singletons or the one containing all three.\nIf we assume a division into binary features, either [p] and [t] or [p] and [k] or [t]\nand [k] must form a natural class in addition. This is so since binary features can\ncut a set only into two parts. If your set has three members, you can single out a\ngiven member by two cuts and only sometimes by one. So you need two binary\nfeatures to distinguish the three from each other. But which ones do we take? In\nthe present case we have a choice of [+labial], [+dental] or [+velar]. The first\ncuts {[p],[t],[k]} into {[p]} and {[t],[k]}; the second cuts it into {[t]} and {[p],[k]}\nand the third into {[k]}, and {[t],[p]}. Any two of these features allow to have the\nsingleton sets as natural classes. If you have only two features then there is a two\nelementsubsetthatisnotanaturalclass(thisisanexercise).\nThechoicebetweenthevariousfeaturebasesisnoteasyandhotlydisputed. It\ndependsonthewaytherulesofthelanguagecanbesimplifiedwhichclassification\nis used. But if that is so, the idea becomes problematic as a foundational tool. It\nisperhapsbetternottoenforcebinarism.\nIn structuralism, the following distinction has been made: a distinction or\nopposition is equipollent or privative. To begin with the latter: the distinction (cid:127)\nbetween a and b is privative if (i) a has something that b does not have or (ii) b\nhas something that a does not have. In case that (i) obtains, we call a marked (in\nopposition to b) and in case that (ii) obtains we call b marked. An equipollent\ndistinction is one that is not of this kind. (So, neither a nor b can be said to be\nmarked.) We have suggested above that the distinctions between speech sounds\nis always equipollent; for example, [p] and [b] are distinct because the one has\nthe feature [\u2212voiced] the other has the feature [+voiced]. Since we have both\nfeatures, by the rules of attribute value structures, a sound must have one of them\nexactly if it does not have the other. There is thus a complete symmetry. If we\nwant to turn this into a privative opposition, we have to explicitly mark one of\nthe features against the other. Linguists have instead following another approach.\nThey devised a notational system with just one feature, say, \u2018voiced\u2019. A sound\nmay either have that feature or not. It is marked precisely when it has the feature,\nand unmarked otherwise. In such a system, [b] is marked (against [p]), because\nit has the feature, while [p] is not. Had we chosen instead the feature \u2018voiceless\u2019,\n[b]wouldhavebeenunmarked,and[p]marked. Intheliteraturethisissometimes\nportrayedasfeatureshavingjustonevalue. Thisuseoflanguageisdangerousand\nshould be avoided. A case of markedness is the pronunciation of [(cid:244)], where the 40 Lecture3: PhonologyI\ndefault pronunciation is voiced, and the marked one is voiceless. However, this\nappliestothephoneticlevel,notthephonemics.\nNotes. The book [Lass, 1984] offers a good discussion of the theory and use\nof features in phonology. Feature systems are subject to big controversy. Roman\nJakobsonwasagreatadvocateoftheideaofbinarism,butitseemstooftenleadto\nartificialresults.

Typically, one only has only if rather that if and only if since\nthere are sound pairs that can be exchanged for each other without necessarily\nbeing in a phoneme. However, it is better to use the more stringent version to get\nan easier feel for this type of definition which is typical for structuralist thinking.\nFurther, what is problematic in this definition is that it does not take into account\nmultiple simultaneous substitution. However, such cases typically are beyond the\nscopeofanintroduction.

Sanskrit\nwordsmayendinthefollowingoftheabove: p,m,t,n,\u0153,k,and\u014b. Thisconsonant\nchanges depending on the initial phoneme of the following word. Sometimes the\ninitial phoneme also changes. An example is /tat Ja ri:ram/, which becomes /tac\nchari:ram/. We shall concentrate here on the more common effect that the last\nphonemechanges.

In the rule given above the action is to replace the input\n(X) by the output (Y) in the given context. If the context is arbitrary, nothing is\nwritten.

Also,\nsince we are mostly dealing with spoken language, there is no real meaning in\ncounting blanks, so we leave the precise nature of blank unspecified. Suppose\nwe want to write rules that capture Sandhi. Each entry of the table presents one\nindividual rule. For example, if te previous word ends in /k/ and the following\nwordbeginswith/b/,thenratherthanthesequence/k#b/wewillseethesequence\n/g#b/.\nThuswefindthatSandhiisamongmanyotherstherule\n(55) /k#b/ \u2192 /g#b/\nWecanreformulatethisinto\n(56) k \u2192 g/ #b\nTobeprecise,itisperhapsusefultothinkthatSandhialsoerasesthewordbound-\nary,soweshouldwritereallytheruleasfollows.\n(57) k# \u2192 g/ b\nHowever, once we understand where I have simplified matters, we can move on\nto the essential question, namely, how to best represent the Sandhi using abstract\nrules.\nIf you do the calculations you will find that this table has 154 cases (and I\nhaven\u2019t even given you the whole table). In 60 cases an actualu change occurs. It\nis true that if there is no change, no rule needs to be written, unless you consider\nthe fact that in all these cases the word boundary is erased. However, in any case\nthis is unsatisfactory. What we want is to represent the regularities directly in our\nrules.\nThere is a way to do this. Notice for example the behaviour of /k/, / \u0153/ and /p/.\nIf the consonant of the following word is voiced, they become voiced, too. If the Lecture4: PhonologyII 47\nconsonant is voiceless, they remain voiceless. This can be encoded into a single\nrule. Observe that the last consonant of the preceding word is a stop; and the first\nconsonant of the following word is a stop, too. Using our representations, we can\ncapturethecontentofalloftheserulesasfollows.\n\" # \" # \" #\n\uf776\uf76f\uf769\uf763\uf765:\u2212 \uf776\uf76f\uf769\uf763\uf765:+ \uf776\uf76f\uf769\uf763\uf765:+\n(58) \u2192 / #\n\uf76e\uf761\uf773 :\u2212 \uf76e\uf761\uf773 :\u2212 \uf76e\uf761\uf773 :\u2212\nAs we explained in the previous lecture, this is to be read as follows: given a\nphoneme, there are three cases. (Case 1) The phoneme does not match the left\nhand side (it is either voiced or a nasal); then no change. (Case 2) The phoneme\nmatches the left hand side but is not in the context required by the rule (does not\nprecede a voiceless stop). Then no change. (Case 3) The phoneme matches the\nleft hand side and is in the required context. In this case, all features that are not\nmentioned in the rule will be left unchanged. This is the way we achieve gener-\nality. I will return below to the issue of [t] shortly. (Notice that every consonant\nwhichisnotanasalisautomaticallyastopinthisset.

We discuss here a\nphenomenon called final devoicing. In Russian and German, stops become de-\nvoiced at the end of a syllable. It is such rules that cannot be formulated in the\nsamewayasabove,namelyasrulesofspecialization. Thisissosincetheyinvolve\ntwo sounds that are not allophones, for example [p] and [m] in Korean or [k] and\n[g] in German.

One is the level of deep phonological representations and the other\nis that of surface phonological representation. The deep representation is more\nabstract and more regular. For German, it contains the information about voicing\nno matter what environment the consonant is in. The surface representation how-\never contains the phonological description of the sounds that actually appear; so\nit will contain only voiced stops at the end of a syllable. The two representations\nare linked by rules that have the power of changing the representation.

However, the evidence\nseems to be that the syllable final [b] is pronounced just like [p], and so it simply\nistransformedinto[p].)\nWe may in fact view all rules proposed above as rules that go from deep to\nsurface phonological mapping. Some ofthe rules justadd features while someof\nthem change features. The view that emerges is that deep phonological structure\ncontainstheminimumspecificationnecessarytobeabletofigureouthowtheob-\njectsounds,whilepreservingthehighestdegreeofabstractionandregularity. For\nexample, strings are formed at deep phonological level by concatenation, while\non the surface this might not be so. We have seen that effect with final devoicing.\nWhileonthedeeplevelthepluralending(orasuffixlikechen)aresimplyadded,\nthe fact that a stop might find itself at the end of the word (or syllable) may make\nit change to something else. The picture is thus the following: the word Rad is\nstoredasasequenceofthreephonemes,andnowordboundaryexistsbecausewe\nmightdecidetoaddsomething. However,whenweformthesingularnominative,\nsuddenly a word boundary gets added, and this is the moment the rule of final\ndevoicingcantakeeffect.\nThesetupisnotwithoutproblems. LookattheEnglishword/mouse/. Itsplu-\nralis/mice/(therootvowelchanges). Howisthischangeaccountedfor? Isthere\nare a phonological rule that says that the root vowel is changed? (We consider\nthe diphthong for simplicity to be a sequence of two vowels of which the second\nis relevant here.) The answer to the second question is negative. Not because\nsuch a rule could not be written, but because it would be incredibly special: it\nwould say that the sequence [maUss#] (with the second \u2018s\u2019 coming from the plu-\nral!) is to be changed into [ma\u0131s#]. Moreover, we expect that phonological rules\ncan be grounded in the articulatory and perceptive quality of the sounds. There\nis nothing that suggests why the proposed change is motivated in terms of diffi-\nculty of pronunciation. We could equally well expect the form [maUs@z], which\nis phonologically well\u2013formed. It just is no plural of the word [maUs] though\nEnglish speakers are free to change that. (Indeed, English did possess more ir-\nregular plurals. The plural of [bUk] was once [be:k], the plural of [\"tunge] was\n[\"tungan], and many more. These have been superseded by regular formations.)\nSo,ifitisnotphonologythatcausesthechange,somethingelsemustdothat. One\napproach is to simply list the singular [maUs] and the plural [ma\u0131s], and no root\nform. Then [ma\u0131s] is not analyzable into a root plus a plural ending, it is just is a 52 Lecture4: PhonologyII\nsimpleform. Anothersolutionistosaythattheroothastwoforms;inthesingular\nwe find[maUs], inthe plural[ma\u0131s]. The pluralhas actuallynoexponent, likethe\nsingular.

Herethequalityofthesecondhalfofthe\ndiphthong is indeterminate between U and \u0131. It is specified as \u2018lower high\u2019.

Notice however that it does not represent a\nphoneme. Inearlyphonologicaltheoryonecalledtheseobjectsarchiphonemes.\nWe shall briefly comment on this solution. First, whether or not one wants to\nuse two stems or employ an underspecified sound is a matter of generality. The\nlattersolutionisonlyusefulwhenitcoversanumberofdifferentcases;inEnglish\nwe have at least /this/:/these/, /woman/:/women/, /foot/:/feet/. In German this\nchange is actually much more widespread (we shall return to that phenomenon).\nSo there is a basis for arguing that we find an archiphoneme here.

Moreover,\nthereisnothingwrongwithsignsbeingempty.\nThis, however, leaves us with a more complex picture of a phonological rep-\nresentation. It contains not only items that define sounds but also funny symbols\nthatactonsoundssomewhereelseintherepresentation.\nNotes on this section. You may have wondered about the use of different\nslashes. Theslashesareindicatorsshowingusatwhichlevelofabstractionweare\nworking. The rule is that /\u00b7/ is used for sequences of phonemes while [\u00b7] is used\nfor sequences of actual sounds. Thus, one rule operates on the phonemic level\nwhile another operates on the phonetic level. Furthermore, writers distinguish a\nsurface phonological level from a deep phonological level. (There could also be\na deep phonetical and surface phonetical level, though that has to my knowledge\nnot been proposed.) In my own experience textbooks do not consistently distin-\nguish between the levels, and for the most part I think that writers themselves do\nnot mentally maintain a map of the levels and their relationships. This therefore\nis a popular source of mistakes. Since I have not gone into much detail about the\ndistinction between the two, obviously there is no reason to ask you to be consis-\ntentinusingtheslahes. Itishoweverimportanttopointoutwhatpeopleintendto\nconveywhentheyusethem.\nIn principle there are two levels: phonetic and phonemic. At the phonemic\nlevel we write /p/, and at the phonetic level we write [p]. Despite the transparent\nsymbolism there is no connection between the two. Phonemics does not know\nhow things sound, it only sees some 40 or so sounds. Writing /p/ is therefore just\na mnemonic aid; we could have used \u2660 instead of /p/ (and no slashes, since now\nit is clear in which level we are!!). Phonemes may be organised using features,\nbut the phonetic content of these features is unknown to phonemics. To connect 54 Lecture4: PhonologyII\nthe (abstract) phoneme /p/ with some sound we have realisation rules: /p/ \u2192 [p]\nis a rule that says that whatever the phoneme /p/ is, it comes out as [p]. The\ntrouble is that [p] is ambiguous in English. We have a different realisation of /p/\nin/spit/thanin/pit/. Therearetwowaystoaccountforthis. Oneistowritethe\nrealisationrulessoastoaccountforthisdifferentbehaviour(Vstandsforvowel),\nforexamplebywriting\n(74) /p/ \u2192 [p]/s V\nAnother is to translate /p/ into the \u2018broad\u2019 vowel [p] and the leave the specifica-\ntion to phonetics. Both views have their attraction, though I prefer the first over\nthe second. I have made no commitment here, though to either of the views, so\nthe use of /\u00b7/ versus [\u00b7] follows no principle and you should not attach too much\nsignificancetoit.\nI also use the slashes for written language.

Thisavoidshavingto\ndealwithtoomanylevels(andpossibilitiesofabstraction). Phonology III: Syllable Structure, Stress\nWords consist of syllables. The structure of syllables is determined\npartly by universal and partly by language specific principles. In par-\nticular we shall discuss the role of the sonoricity hierarchy in organ-\nisingthesyllabicstructure,andtheprincipleofmaximalonset.\nUtterances are not mere strings of sounds. They are structured into units larger\nthan sounds. A central unit is the syllable. Words consist of one or several sylla-\nbles. Syllables in English begin typically with some consonants. Then comes a\nvoweloradiphthongandthensomeconsonantsagain. Thefirstsetofconsonants\nistheonset,thegroupofvowelsthenucleusandthesecondgroupofconsonants\nthe coda. The combination of nucleus and coda is called rhyme. So, syllables\nhavethefollowingstructure:\n(75) [onset [nucleus coda]]\nForexample,/strength/isawordconsistingofasinglesyllable:\n[st(cid:244) [E \u014b T]]\nOnset Nucleus Coda\n(76)\nRhyme\nSyllable\nThus, the onset consists of three consonants: [s], [t] and [(cid:244)], the nucleus consists\njust of [E], and the coda has [\u014b] and [T]. We shall begin with some fundamental\nprinciples. Thefirstconcernsthestructureofthesyllable.\nSyllableStructureI(Universal)\nEvery syllable has a nonempty nucleus. Both coda and onset may\nhoweverbeempty.\nA syllable which has an empty coda is called open. Examples of open syllables\nare /a/ [e] (onset is empty), /see/ [si] (onset is nonempty). A syllable that is\nnot open is closed. Examples are /in/ [\u0131n] (onset empty) and /sit/ [s\u0131t] (onset\nnonempty). ThesecondprincipleidentifiesthenucleiforEnglish.\nVowelsareNuclear(English)\nAnucleuscanonlycontainavoweloradiphthong. 56 Lecture5: PhonologyIII\nThis principle is not fully without problems and that is the reason that we shall\nlook below at a somewhat more general principle. The main problem is the un-\nclear status of some sounds, for example [\u02dc]. They are in between a vowel and\nconsonant, and indeed sometimes end up in onset position (see above) and some-\ntimesinnuclearposition,forexamplein/bird/[b\u02dcd].\nThedivisionintosyllablesisclearlyfeltbyanyspeaker,althoughtheresome-\ntimes is hesitation as to exactly how to divide a word into syllables. Consider the\nword /atmosphere/. Is the /s/ part of the second syllable or part of the third?\nThe answer is not straightforward. In particular the stridents (that is, the sounds\n[s],[S])enjoyaspecialstatus. Someclaimthattheyareextrasyllabic(notpartof\nanysyllableatall),somemaintainthattheyareambisyllabic(theybelongtoboth\nsyllables). Weshallnotgointothathere.\nThe existence of rhymes can be attested by looking at verses (which also ex-\nplainstheterminology): wordsthatrhymedonotneedtoendinthesamesyllable,\nthey only need to end in the same rhyme: /fun/ \u2013 /run/ \u2013 /spun/ \u2013 /shun/. Also,\nthe coda is the domain of a rule that affects many languages: For example, in\nEnglish and Hungarian, within the coda the obstruents must either all be voiced\nor unvoiced; in German and Russian, all obstruents in coda must be voiceless.\n(Here is an interesting problem caused among other by nasals. Nasals are stan-\ndardly voiced. Now try to find out what is happening in this case by pronouncing\nwords with a sequence nasal+voiceless stop in coda, such as /hump/, /stunt/,\n/Frank/.) Germanic verse in the Middle Ages used a rhyming technique where\nthe onsets of the rhyming words had to be the same. (This is also called allit-\neration. It allowed to rhyme two words of the same stem; German had a lot of\nUmlaut and ablaut, that is to say, it had a lot of root vowel change making it\nimpossible to use the same word to rhyme with itself (say /run/ \u2013 /ran/).) It is\nworthwhile to remain with the notion of the domain of a rule. Many phonolog-\nical constraints are seen as conditions that concern two adjacent sounds. When\nthese sounds come into contact, they undergo change to a smaller or greater ex-\ntent,forsomesoundcombinationsarebetterpronounceablethanothers. Wehave\ndiscussed sandhi at length in Lecture 4. For example, the Latin word /in/ \u2018in\u2019 is\na verbal prefix, which changes in writing (and therefore in pronunciation) to /im/\nwhen it precedes a labial (/impedire/). Somewhat more radical is the change\nfrom [ml] to [mpl] to avoid the awkward combination [ml] (the word /templum/\nderives from /temlom/, with /tem/ being the root, meaning \u2018to cut\u2019). There is an\ninfluential theory in phonology, autosegmental phonology, which assumes that Lecture5: PhonologyIII 57\nTable10: TheSonoricityHierarchy\ndarkvowels > midvowels > highvowels\n[a],[o] [\u00e6],[\u0153] [i],[y]\n> r-sounds > nasals;laterals > vd.fricatives\n[r];[(cid:244)] [m],[n];[l] [z],[Z]\n> vd.plosives > vl.fricatives > vl.plosives\n[b],[d] [s],[S] [p],[t]\nphonological features are organized on different scores (tiers) and can spread to\nadjacent segments independently from each other. Think for example of the fea-\nture [\u00b1voiced]. The condition on the coda in English is expressed by saying that\nthe feature [\u00b1voiced] spreads along the coda. Clearly, we cannot allow the fea-\nture to spread indiscriminately, otherwise the total utterance is affected. Rather,\nthe spreading is blocked by certain constituent boundaries; these can be the coda,\nonset, nucleus, rhyme, syllable, foot or the word. To put that on its head: the fact\nthat features are blocked indicates that we are facing a constituent boundary. So,\nvoicingharmonyindicatesthatEnglishhasacoda.\nThe nucleus is the element that bears the stress. We have said that in English\nit is a vowel, but this applies only to careful speech. In general this need not be\nso. Consider the standard pronunciation of /beaten/: [\"bi:thn] (with a syllabic\n\"\n[n]). For my ears the division is into two syllables: [bi:] and [thn]. (In German\nthis is certainly so; the verb /retten/ is pronounced [\"KEthn]. The\" [n] must there-\n\"\nfore occupy the nucleus of the second syllable.) There are more languages like\nthis. (Slaviclanguagesarefullofconsonantclustersandsyllablesthatdonotcon-\ntain a vowel. Consider the island /Krk/, for example.) In general, phonologists\nhave posited the following conditions on syllable structure. Sounds are divided\nas follows. The sounds are aligned into a so-called sonoricity hierarchy, which\nis shown in Table 10 (vd. = voiced, vl. = voiceless). The syllable is organized as\nfollows.\nSyllableStructureII\nWithin a syllable the sonoricity strictly increases and then decreases 58 Lecture5: PhonologyIII\nagain. Itishighestinthenucleus.\nThis means that a syllable must contain at least one sound which is at least as\nsonorous as all the others in the syllable. It is called the sonoricity peak and is\nfound in the nucleus. Thus, in the onset consonants must be organized such that\nthe sonority rises, while in the coda it is the reverse. The conditions say nothing\nabout the nucleus. In fact, some diphthongs are increasing ([\u0131@] as in the British\nEnglish pronunciation of /here/) others are decreasing ([a\u0131], [o\u0131]). This explains\nwhy the phonotactic conditions are opposite at the beginning of the syllable than\nat the end. You can end a syllable in [(cid:244)t], but you cannot begin it that way. You\ncanstartasyllableby[t(cid:244)],butyoucannotenditthatway(ifyoutomakeupwords\nwith [t(cid:244)], automatically, [(cid:244)] or even [t(cid:244)] will be counted as part of the following\nsyllable). Let me briefly note why diphthongs are not considered problematic in\nEnglish: itismaintainedthatthesecondpartisactuallyaglide(notavowel),and\nso would have to be part of the coda. Thus, /right/ would have the following\nstructure:\nr a j t\n(77)\nO N C C\nThesonoricityof[j]islowerthanthatof[a],soitisnotnuclear.\nAmoment\u2019sreflectionnowshowswhythepositionofstridentsisproblematic:\nthesequence[ts]istheonlylegitimateonsetaccordingtothesonoricityhierarchy,\n[st] is ruled out. Unfortunately, both are attested in English, with [ts] only occur-\nringinnon-nativewords(eg/tse-tse/,/tsunami/). Therearephonologistswho\neven believe that [s] is part of its own little structure here (\u2018extrasyllabic\u2019). In\nfact, there are languages which prohibit this sequence; Spanish is a case in point.\nSpanish avoids words that start with [st]. Moreover, Spanish speakers like to add\n[e] in front of words that do and are therefore difficult to pronounce. Rather than\nsay [st(cid:244)enZ] (/strange/) they will say [est(cid:244)enZ]. The effect of this maneuver is\nthat [s] is now part of the coda of an added syllable, and the onset is reduced (in\ntheirspeech)tojust[t(cid:244)],or,intheirpronunciationmostlikely[tr]. Noticethatthis\nmeans that Spanish speakers apply the phonetic rules of Spanish to English, be-\ncause if they applied the English rules they would still end up with the onset [st(cid:244)]\n(seebelow). Frenchissimilar,butFrenchspeakersaresomehowlesspronetoadd\nthe vowel. (French has gone through the following sequence: from [st] to [est]\nto [et]. Compare the word /\u00e9toile/ \u2018star\u2019, which derives from Latin /stella/\n\u2018star\u2019.) Lecture5: PhonologyIII 59\nRepresenting the Syllabification\nThe division of words into syllables is called syllabification. In written language\nthesyllableboundariesarenotmarked,sowordsarenotexplicitlysyllabified. We\nonly see where words begin and end. The question is: does this hold also for the\nrepresentations that we need to assume, for example, in the mental lexicon of a\nspeaker? There is evidence that almost no information about the syllable bound-\naries is written into the mental lexicon. One reason is that the status of sounds at\nthe boundary change as soon as new material comes in. Let us look at the plural\n/cats/ of /cat/. The plural marker is /s/, and it is added at the end. Let\u2019s sup-\npose the division into syllables was already given in the lexicon. Then we would\nhavesomethinglikethis: /\u2020cat\u2020/,where\u2020marksthesyllableboundary. Thenthe\nplural will be /\u2020cat\u2020s\u2020/, with the plural \u2018s\u2019 forming a syllable of its own. This\nis not the desired result, although the sonoricity hierarchy would predict exactly\nthat. Let us look harder. We have seen that in German coda consonants devoice.\nThe word /Rad/ is pronounced [\"Ka:t] as if written /Rat/. Suppose we have added\nthe syllable boundary: /\u2020Rad\u2020/. Now add the genitive /es/ (for which we would\nalso have to assume a syllabification, for example /\u2020es\u2020/, or /es\u2020/). Then we get\n/\u2020Rat\u2020es\u2020/, which by the rules of German would have to be pronounced [\"Ka:t\nP@s], with an inserted glottal stop, because German (like English) does not have\nsyllables beginning with a vowel (whereas French does) and prevents that by in-\nsertingtheglottalstop. (Phonemicallythereisnoglottalstop,however!) Inactual\nfact the pronunciation is [\"Ka:d@s]. There are two indicators why the sound cor-\nresponding to /d/ is now at the beginning of the second syllable: (1) there is no\nglottal stop following it, (2) it is pronounced with voicing, that is, [d] rather than\n[t].\nWenoticerightawayaconsequenceofthis: syllablesarenotthesameasmor-\nphemes (see Lecture 7 for a definition). And morphemes neither necessarily are\nsyllables or sequences thereof, nor do syllable boundaries constitute morpheme\nboundaries. Morphemes can be as small as a single phoneme (like the English\nplural), a phonemic feature (like the plural of /mouse/), they can just be a stress\nshift (nominalisation of the verb /protest/ ([pro\"tEst] into /protest/ [\"protEst])\nor they can even be phonemically zero. For example, in English, you can turn a\nnoun into a verb (/to google/, /to initial/, /to cable/, /to TA/). The rep-\nresentationdoesnotchangeatallneitherinwritingnorinspeaking. Youjustverb\nit... 60 Lecture5: PhonologyIII\nOf course it may be suggested that the syllabification is explicitly given and\nchanged as more things come in. But this position unnecessarily complicates\nmatters. Syllabification is to a large extent predictable. So there is reason to\nbelieveitislargelynotstored. Itisenoughtojustinsertsyllableboundarymarkers\nin the lexicon where they are absolutely necessary and leave the insertion of the\notherboundarymarkerstobedeterminedlater. Anotherreasonisactuallythatthe\nrateofspeechdeterminesthepronunciation,whichinturndeterminesthesyllable\nstructure.\nLanguage Particulars\nLanguagesdifferinwhattypesofsyllablestheyallow. Thus,notonlydotheyuse\ndifferent sounds they also restrict the possible combinations of these sounds in\nparticular ways. Finnish allows (with few exceptions) only one consonant at the\nonsetofasyllable. Moreover,Finnishwordspreferablyendinavowel,anasalor\n\u2018s\u2019. JapanesesyllablesarepreferablyCV(consonantplusvowel). Thishaseffects\nwhen these languages adopt new words. Finns for example call the East German\ncar /Trabant/ simply [rabant:i] (with a vowel at the end and a long [t]!). The\nonset [tr] is simplified to just the [r]. There are also plenty of loanwords: /koulu/\n[kOulu] \u2018school\u2019 has lost the \u2018s\u2019, /rahti/ [rahti] \u2018freight\u2019 has lost the \u2018f\u2019, and so\non. Noticethatitisalwaysthelastconsonantthatwins.\nEnglish too has constraints on the structure of syllables. Some are more strict\nthanothers. WenoticerightawaythatEnglishdoesallowtheonsettocontainsev-\neral consonants, similarly with the coda. However, some sequences are banned.\nOnsets may not contain a nasal except in first place (exception: [sm] and [sn]).\nThere are some loanwords that break the rule: /mnemonic/ and /tmesis/. The\nsequence sonorant-obstruent is also banned ([mp], [(cid:244)k], [(cid:244)p], [lt] and so on; this\nis a direct consequence of the sonoricity hierarchy). Stridents are not found other\nthan in first place; exceptions are [ts] and [ks], found however only in nonnative\nwords. The cluster [ps] is reduced to [s]. It also makes a difference whether the\nsyllable constitutes a word or is peripheral to the word. Typically, inside a word\nsyllableshavetobesimplerthanattheboundary.\nSyllabification is based on expectations concerning syllable structure that de-\nrivefromthewell-formednessconditionsofsyllables. However,theseleaveroom.\n[\"pleito](/Plato/)canbesyllabified[\"plei.to]or[\"pleit.o]. Inbothcasesthesylla- Lecture5: PhonologyIII 61\nbles we get are well formed. However, if a choice exists, then preference is given\ntocreatingeitheropensyllablesorsyllableswithonset.\nAll these principles are variations of the same theme: if there are consonants,\nlanguagespreferthemtobeintheonsetratherthanthecoda.\nMaximiseOnset\nPutasmanyconsonantsintotheonsetaspossible.\nThe way this operates is as follows. First we need to know what the nucleus of\na word is. In English this is easy: vowels and only vowels are nuclear. Thus\nwe can identify the sequences coda+onset but we do not yet know how to divide\nthem into a coda and a subsequent onset. Since a syllable must have a nucleus, a\nword can only begin with an onset. Therefore, say that a sequence of consonants\nis a legitimate onset of English if there is a word such that the largest stretch of\nconsonantsitbeginswithisthatsequence.\nLegitimateOnsets\nAn sequence of sounds is is a legitimate onset if and only if it is the\nonsetofthefirstsyllableofanEnglishword.\nForexample,[sp(cid:244)]isalegitimateonsetofEnglish,sincetheword/sprout/begins\nwith it. Notice that /sprout/ does not show that [sp] is a legitimate onset, since\nthesequenceofconsonantsthatitbeginswithis[sp(cid:244)]. Toshowthatitislegitimate\nwe need to give another word, namely /spit/. In conjunction with the fact that\nvowelsandonlyvowelsarenuclear,wecanalwaysdetectwhichsoundsbelongto\neither a coda or an onset without knowing whether it is onset or coda. However,\nif a sound if before the first nucleus, it must definitely be part of an onset. In\nprinciple, there could be onsets that never show up at the beginning of a word,\nso the above principle of legitimate onsets in conjunction with Maximise Onsets\nactually says that this can never happen. And this is now how we can find our\nsyllable boundaries. Given a sequence of consonants that consists a sequence\ncoda+onset, we split it at the earliest point so that the second part is a legitimate\nonset,thatis,anonsetatthebeginningofaword.\nFromnowonwedenotethesyllableboundarybyadot,whichisinsertedinto\nthe word as ordinarily spelled. So, we shall write /in.to/ to signal that the sylla-\nblesare/in/and/to/. LetusnowlookattheeffectofMaximiseOnset. Forexam-\nple, take the words /restless/ and /restricted/. We do not find /re.stless/ 62 Lecture5: PhonologyIII\nnor/res.tless/. ThereasonisthatthethereisnoEnglishwordthatbeginswith\n/stl/ or /tl/. There are plenty of words that begin in [l], for example /lawn/.\nHence, the only possibility is /rest.less/. No other choice is possible. Now\nlook at /restricted/. There are onsets of the form [st(cid:244)] (/strive/). There are\nno onsets of the form [kt], so the principle of maximal onsets mandates that the\nsyllabification is /re.stric.ted/. Without Maximize Onset, /res.tric.ted/\nand/rest.ric.ted/would alsobe possiblesince bothcoda and onsetare legiti-\nmate. Indeed, maximal onsets work towards making the preceding syllable open,\nandtohavesyllableswithonset.\nIn the ideal case all consonants are onset consonants, so syllables are open.\nOccasionally this strategy breaks down. For example, /suburb/ is syllabified\n/sub.urb/. This reflects the composition of the word (from Latin /sub/ \u2018un-\nder\u2019 and /urbs/ \u2018city\u2019, so it means something like the lower city; cf. English\n/downtown/ which has a different meaning!). One can speculate about this case.\nIfittrulyformsanexceptionweexpectthatifarepresentationinthementallexi-\nconwillcontainasyllablyboundary: /s2b\u2020\u02dcb/.\nStress\nSyllables are not the largest phonological unit. They are themselves organised\ninto larger units. A group of two, sometimes three syllables is called a foot. A\nfootcontainsonesyllablethatismoreprominentthantheothersinthesamefoot.\nFeet are grouped into higher units, where again one is more prominent than the\nothers,andsoon. Prominenceismarkedbystress. Therearevariouswaystogive\nprominence to a syllable. Ancient Greek is said to have marked prominence by\npitch(thestressedsyllablewasaboutafifthhigher(3/2ofthefrequencyofanun-\nstressed syllable). Other languages (like German) use loudness. Other languages\nuse combination of the two (Swedish). Within a given word there is one syllable\nthat is the most prominent. In IPA it is marked by a preceding [\"]. We say that it\ncarriesprimarystress. Languagesdifferwithrespecttotheplacementofprimary\nstress. Finnish and Hungarian place the stress on the first syllable, French on the\nlast. Latin put the stress on the last but one (penultimate), if it was long (that\nis to say, had a long vowel or was closed); otherwise, if was a syllable that pre-\ncededit(theantepenultimate)thenthatsyllablegotprimarystress. Thuswehad\npe.re.gri.nus (\u2018foreign\u2019) with stress on the penultimate (gri) since the vowel\nwas long, but in.fe.ri.or with stress on the antepenultimate /fe/ since the /i/ Lecture5: PhonologyIII 63\nin the penultimate was short. (Obviously, monosyllabic words had the stress on\nthe last syllable.) Sanskrit was said to have free stress, that is to say, stress was\nfreetofallanywhereintheword.\nTypically, within a foot the syllables like to follow in a specific pattern. If the\nfoot has two syllables, it consists either in an unstressed followed by a stressed\nsyllable (iambic metre), or vice versa (trochaic metre). Sometimes a foot car-\nries three syllables (a stressed followed by two unstressed ones, a dactylus). So,\nif the word has more than three syllables, there will be a syllable that is more\nprominentthanitsneighboursbutnotcarryingmainstress. Youmaytrythiswith\ntheword/antepenultimate/. Youwillfindthatthefirstsyllableismorepromi-\nnent than the second but less than the fourth. We say that it carries secondary\nstress: [(cid:127)antEp@n\"2lt\u0131mEt]. Or [@(cid:127)s\u0131m@\"le\u0131Sn]. The so-called metrical stress theory\ntriestoaccountforstressasfollows. Thesyllablesareeachrepresentedbyacross\n(\u00d7). ThisisaLayer0stress. Then,inasequenceofcycles,syllablesgetassigned\nmore crosses. The more crosses, the heavier the syllable. The number of crosses\nis believed to correspond to the absolute weight of a syllable. So, a word that has\nasyllableofweight3(threecrosses)islessprominentthanonewithasyllableof\nweight4.

The syllable [s\u0131] carries\nprimary stress in /assimilate/. Primary stress is always marked in the lexicon,\nand this mark tells us that the syllable must get a cross. Further, heavy syllables\nget an additional cross. A syllable counts as heavy in English if it has a coda or a\ndiphthong or long vowel. So, [le\u0131] gets an extra cross. [Sn] is not heavy since the\n[n]isnuclear. SothisisnowthesituationatLayer1:\nLayer1 \u00d7 \u00d7\n(79) Layer0 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n@ s\u0131 m@ le\u0131 Sn\nNext, the nominalisation introduces main stress on the fourth syllable. So this\nsyllable gets main stress and is therefore assigned another cross. The result is\nthis:\nLayer2 \u00d7\nLayer1 \u00d7 \u00d7\n(80)\nLayer0 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n@ s\u0131 m@ le\u0131 Sn 64 Lecture5: PhonologyIII\nIf larger units are considered, there are more cycles.

Then the\nmain syllable gets a cross at Layer 2. Now, if the two are put together, a decision\nmust be made which of the two words is more prominent. It is the second, and\nthisisthereforewhatweget:\nLayer3 \u00d7\nLayer2 \u00d7 \u00d7\n(82) Layer1 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nLayer0 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nme\u0131n te\u0131n @ s\u0131 m@ le\u0131 Sn\nNotice that the stress is governed by a number of heterogeneous factors. The first\nis the weight of the syllable; this decides about Layer 1 stress. Then there is the\nposition of the main stress (which in English must to a large extent be learned\u2014\nequivalently,itmustexplicitlybegivenintherepresentation,unlikesyllablestruc-\nture). Third,itdependsonthewayinwhichthewordisembeddedintolargerunits\n(so syntactic criteria play a role here). Also, morphological formation rules can\nchange the location of the main stress! For example, the suffix (a)tion attracts\nstress ([(cid:127)kOm\"ba\u0131n] and [(cid:127)kOmb\u0131\"ne\u0131Sn]) so does the suffix ee (as in /employee/),\nbut /ment/ does not ([\"gav\u02dcn] and [\"gav\u02dcnment]). The suffix /al/ does move the\naccentwithoutattractingit([\"\u00e6nEkdot]versus[(cid:127)\u00e6nEk\"dotal]).\nFinally,wementionaproblemconcerningtherepresentationsthatkeepscom-\ning up. It is said that certain syllables cannot receive stress because they contain\na vowel that cannot be stressed (for example, schwa: [@]). On the other hand, we\ncan also say that a vowel is schwa because it is unstressed. Take, for example,\nthe pair [\"(cid:244)i@la\u0131z] and [(cid:127)(cid:244)i@l\u0131\"ze\u0131Sn]. When the stress shifts, the realisation of /i/\nchanges. So,isitratherthestressthatchangesandmakesthevowelchangequal-\nityordoesthevowelchangeandmakethestressshift? Often,theseproblemsfind\nno satisfactory answer. In this particular example it seems that the stress shift is\nfirst,anditinducesthevowelchange. Itisknownthatunstressedvowelsundergo Lecture5: PhonologyIII 65\nreduction in time. The reason why French stress in always on the last syllable is\nbecause it inherited the stress pattern from Latin, but the syllables following the\nstressed syllable eventually got lost. Here the stress was given and it drove the\ndevelopment. Phonology IV: Rules, Constraints and Optimality The-\nory\nScheduling Rules\nIt is important to be clear about a few problems that arise in connections with\nrules. If you have some string, say /teatime/ and a rule, say t \u2192 d, how should\nyougoaboutapplyingit? Once,twice,asoftenasyoucan? Andifyoucanapply\nit several times, where do you start? Suppose you can apply the rule only once,\nthen you get either /deatime/ or /teadime/, depending on where you apply it. If\nyou apply if as often as you can, then you can another round and apply the rule.\nThis time the result is the same, /deadime/. This is not always so. Consider the\nrule a \u2192 x/ a; with input /aaa/ you have two choices: you can apply it to the\nfirst occurrence of /a/ or to the second. The third is not eligible because of the\ncontext restriction. If you apply the rule to the first occurrence you get /xaa/. If\nyouapplyittothesecondyouget/axa/. With/xaa/youcananotherround,giving\n/xxa/; but when you did the second, the rule can no longer apply. Often a proper\nformulationoftheruleitselfwillbeenoughtoensureonlythecorrectresultswill\nbe derived. Sometimes, however, an explicit scheduling must be given, such as:\napply the rule going from left to right as long as you can, or similar statements.\nInthislectureweshallnotgointothedetailsofthis.\nInstead we shall turn to another problem, namely the interaction between two\nrules. I give a very simple example. Suppose we have two rules, R : a \u2192 b and\n1\ntheotherR : b\u2192c. Thenwecanscheduletheminmanyways.\n2\n(cid:192) R orR canappliedonce;\n1 2\n` R orR canbeappliedanynumberoftimes;\n1 2\n\u00b4 R mustbeappliedbeforeR ;\n1 2\n\u02c6 R mustbeappliedbeforeR .\n2 1\nAllthesechoicesgivedifferentresults. Weshallexemplifythiswithaninteresting\nproblem,thebasicformofthepasttensemarkerinEnglish. Lecture6: PhonologyIV 67\nA Problem Concerning the Underlying Form\nRegular verbs form the past tense by adding one of the following three suffixes:\n[t],[d]or[@d]. Thechoicebetweentheseformsisdeterminedbytheroot.\n[t] [d] [@d]\nlicked [l\u0131kt] bugged [b2gd] mended [mEnd@d]\n(83) squished [skw\u0131St] leaned [lind] parted [pA(cid:244)t@d]\nkept [kEpt] buzzed [b2zd] feasted [fist@d]\nlaughed [l\u00e6ft] played [ple\u0131d] batted [b\u00e6t@d]\nWe ask: what is the source of this difference? Surely, it is possible to say that the\npasthasthreedifferentformsandthatdependingontheverbadifferentformmust\nbe chosen. This, however, misses one important point, namely that the choice of\nthe form is determined solely by the phonological form of the verb and can be\nmotivated by phonological constraints of English. The facts can be summarized\nasfollows.\n(cid:192) [d]isfoundifthelastsoundoftheverbisvoicedbutunequalto[d].\n` [t]isfoundifthelastsoundoftheverbisvoicelessbutunequalto[t].\n\u00b4 [@d]isfoundiftheverbendsin[d]or[t].\nWe mention here that it is required that the verb is regular. Thus, /run/ and\n/catch/ are of course not covered by this rule. We may think of the latter as\nentered in the mental lexicon as unanalysed forms. Thus, rather than seeing\n/caught/asasequenceoftwoforms,namely/catch/plussomepasttensemarker,\nI think of the form entered as a whole, though otherwise functioning in the same\nway. It is, if you will, an idiom. (Compare this with earlier discussions of the\npluralformation.)\nItseemsthatthechoicescanbeaccountedforsolelybyapplyingsomegeneral\nprinciples. First, notice that in a coda, with the exception of sonorants ([l], [m],\n[n]), all consonants agree in voicing. An obstruent is a consonant that is either a\nstop(oranaffricate),orafricative.\nVoiceAgreementPrinciple\nAdjacent obstruent sequences must either be both [\uf776\uf76f\uf769\uf763\uf765 : +] or both\n[\uf776\uf76f\uf769\uf763\uf765 : \u2212]attheendofaword. 68 Lecture6: PhonologyIV\n(The principle is less general than possible: the constraint is valid not only at the\nend of a word but in any coda.) This goes half way in explaining the choice of\nthe suffix form. It tells us why we see [d] after voiced consonants. But it does\nnot tell us why it is that we get [lind] rather than [lint], because either of them\nis legitimate according to this principle. Furthermore, we do not know why we\nfind the inserted schwa. The latter can be explained as follows: suppose there\nwas no schwa. Then the present and the past forms would sound alike (/mendd/\nwouldbe[mEnd]). Languagestrytoavoiddoubleconsonants(althoughtheynever\ncompletely manage), and English employs the strategyto insert schwa also in the\nplural. Wefind[b2s@z]/busses/(or/buses/),not[b2s:] (/buss/,withalong/s/).\n(Anotherpopularstrategyishaplology,thedroppingofoneoftheconsonants.)\nIt is possible to recruit the Voice Agreement Principle if we assume that there\nisjustasingleform notthree,andthatvariantsariseonlyas theresultofarepair.\nTherepairisperformedbyapplyingsomerules. Variousanalysesarepossible.\nAnalysis 1. We assume that the underlying form is [d]. There is a rule that de-\nvoices [d] right after a voiceless obstruent. There is a second rule which inserts a\nschwa right before [d]. For the purpose of the definition of the rules, two conson-\nsants are called similar if they differ at most in the voicing feature (for example,\n[t]issimilartoboth[t]and[d],butnothingelse).\n\" # \" #\n+voice \u2212voice\n(84a) \u2192 /[\u2212voice] #\n+obstruent +obstruent\n\u2205 \u2192 [@] /C C0\n(84b)\n(CandC0 similar)\nThe symbol \u2205 denotes the empty string. The first rule is actually two rules in our\nfeaturesystem. Ireproduceherethereproperformulation:\n\" # \" #\nvoice : + voice : \u2212\n\u2192 /[\u2212voice] #\nmanner:stop manner:stop\n(85) \" # \" #\nvoice : + voice : \u2212\n\u2192 /[\u2212voice] #\nmanner:fricative manner:fricative\nThe second rule effectively says that it is legal to insert schwa anywhere between\nsimilar consonants. Since we have two rules, there is a choice as to which one\nshall be applied first. We shall first schedule (84a) before (84b). This means that Lecture6: PhonologyIV 69\nthe rule (84a) is applied to the original form F , giving us an output form F , and\n0 1\nthen we apply rule (84b) to get F . Each rule applies only once, so the output is\n2\nF . Thisgivesthefollowingresult:\n2\nroot /b2gd/ /l\u0131kd/ /mEndd/ /sta(cid:244)td/\n(86) (84b) /b2gd/ /l\u0131kd/ /mEnd@d/ /sta(cid:244)t@d/\n(84a) /b2gd/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEnd@d/ /sta(cid:244)t@d/\nNoticethatwhenwesaythataruledoesnotapplythisdoesnotmeanthatnoout-\nput is generated. It means that the form is left unchanged by the rule. Textbooks\nsometimesindicatethisbyahyphenasiftosaythatthereisnotoutput. Butthere\nis an output, it just is the same as the input. So I do not follow the practice. You\nmay figure out for yourselves in which cases this has happened! Notice, too, that\nsometimesrulesdoapplyanddonotchangeanything.\nNow, suppose we had instead scheduled (84a) before (84b). Then this would\nbetheoutcome:\nroot /b2gd/ /l\u0131kd/ /mEndd/ /sta(cid:244)td/\n(87) (84a) /b2gd/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEndd/ /sta(cid:244)tt/\n(84b) /b2gd/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEnd@d/ /sta(cid:244)t@t/\nIf the last consonant is /t/, the rule (84a) would first assimilate the past tense\nmarker, and we get the suffix / @t/, contrary to fact. Thus, the order in which the\nrules apply is relevant here. There is, however, nothing intrinsic in the system of\nthe rules that tells us in which order they have to apply. This has to be stipulated.\nIn the present analysis we see that the second ordering always gives us an output\nform,butsometimesthewrongone.\nAnalysis 2. The underlying form is assumed to be [t]. In place of (84a) there\nnow is a rule that voices [t] right after a voiced obstruent or a vowel. There is a\nsecondrulewhichinsertsaschwarightbefore[d]or[t].\n\" # \" #\n\u2212voice voice : +\n(88a) \u2192 /[+voice] #\n+obstruent \uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf76e\uf765\uf772:stop\n(88b) \u2205 \u2192[@] /C C0\n(CandC0 similar) 70 Lecture6: PhonologyIV\nroot /b2gt/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEndt/ /sta(cid:244)tt/\n(89) (88b) /b2gt/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEnd@t/ /sta(cid:244)t@t/\n(88a) /b2gd/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEnd@d/ /sta(cid:244)t@d/\nIfweschedule(88a)before(88b),thiswillbetheoutcome:\nroot /b2gt/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEndt/ /sta(cid:244)tt/\n(90) (88a) /b2gd/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEndd/ /sta(cid:244)tt/\n(88b) /b2gd/ /l\u0131kt/ /mEnd@d/ /sta(cid:244)t@t/\nOnceagain,weseethatschwainsertionmusttakeplacefirst.\nAnalysis 3.

Lecture6: PhonologyIV 71\nThe principal difference between them is solely the extent to which the rules\nthat transform them can be motivated language internally as well as language ex-\nternally. And this is also the criterion that will make us choose one analysis over\ntheothers. Let\u2019slookcarefully. First,letusgobacktotheVoiceAgreementPrin-\nciple. It says only that adjacent obstruents agree in voicing, it does not claim that\nobstruents must agree with the preceding vowel, since we do actually find forms\nlike [k\u00e6t]. Analysis 2 incorporates the wrong version of the Voice Agreement\nPrinciple. Rule (88a) repairs some of the forms without need, while Analysis\n1 repairs the forms if and only if they do not conform to the Voice Agreement\nPrinciple. Now look at Analysis 3: it does not conflict with the Voice Agree-\nment Principle. However, it proposes to eliminate schwa in certain forms such as\n[\"l\u0131ked]. There is however no reason why this form is bad. There are words in\nEnglish such as /wicked/ that have such a sequence. So, it repairs forms that are\nactually well-formed. Thus the best analysis is the first, and it proposes that the\nunderylingfomis[d].\nLet us summarize: an analysis is preferred over another if it proposes laws of\nchangethatarewidelyattested(schwainsertionisoneofthem,andfinaldevoicing\nisanother). Also,ananalysisisdispreferredifitsruleschangerepresentationsthat\nareactuallywell-formed. Thus,rulesofthekinddiscussedhereareseenasrepair\nstrategiesthatexplainwhyaformsometimesdoesnotappearinthewayexpected.\nWhat we are looking at here is, by the way, the mapping from deep phonological\nform to surface phonological form. The last bit of evidence that makes us go for\nAnalysis1isthefollowingprinciple:\nNot-Too-SimilarPrinciple\nNo English word contains a sequence of subsequent similar obstru-\nents.\nNamely, Rule (84a) devoices an obstruent in coda if the preceding consonant is\nvoiceless. And in that case, the Voice Agreement Principle is violated. After the\nrule has applied, the offending part is gone. Rule (84b) applies if there are two\nsubsequent similar consonants, precisely when the Not-Too-Similar Principle is\nviolated. Afterapplicationoftheruletheoffendingpartisgone. 72 Lecture6: PhonologyIV\nWhich Repair for Which Problem?\nThe idea that we are pursuing is that deep-to-surface mappings institutionalize a\nrepair of impossible situations. Thus, every rule is motivated from the fact that\nthe input structure violates a constraint of the language and the output structure\nremovesthatoffendingpart. Unfortunately,thisisnotallofthestory. Lookatthe\ncondition that onsets may not branch. This constraint exists in many languages,\nforexampleinJapaneseandFinnish. Butthetwolanguagesapplydifferentrepair\nstrategies. While Japanese likes to insert vowels, Finnish likes to cut the onset to\nthe last vowel. Both repair strategies are attested in other languages. However,\nwe could imagine a language that simplifies an onset cluster to its first element:\nwith this strategy /trabant/ would become not /rabantti/ but /tabantti/ in\nFinnish,Germanic/hrengas/wouldbecomenot/rengas/,but/hengas/instead,\nandsoon. Thislatterstrategyishowevernot attested. So,wefindthatamongthe\ninfinite possibilities to avoid forbidden cluster combinations, only some get used\nat all, while others are completely disfavoured. Among those that are in principle\navailable, certain languages choose one and not the other, but in other languages\nitistheopposite.\nSome general strategies can actually be motivated to a certain degree. Look\nat schwa insertion as opposed to schwa deletion. While the insertion of a schwa\nis inevitably going to improve the structure (because languages all agree in that\nCV is a syllable...) the deletion of a schwa can in principle produce clusters that\nare illegitimate. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that deleting a schwa will make\nmatters betters. Thus, we would expect that there is a bias towards the repair\nby insertion of schwa. Yet, all these arguments have to be taken with care. For\nexample, if a rule changes stress, this can be a motivating factor in reducing or\neliminatingavowel.\nOptimality Theory\nSeveralwaystolookattheregularitiesoflanguagehavebeenproposed:\n+ The generative approach proposes representations and rules. The rules\nshallgenerateallandonlythelegitimaterepresentationsofthelanguage.\n+ The descriptive or model-theoretic approach proposes only representa- Lecture6: PhonologyIV 73\ntions and conditions that a representation has to satisfy in order to belong\ntoagivenlanguage.\nNote that generative linguists do not always propose that rules are real, that is,\nin the head of a speaker and that derivations take place in time. They would say\nthat the rules are a way to systematize the data. If that is so, however, it is not\nclear why we should not adopt a purely descriptive account, characterizing all\nonly the legal representations rather than pretending that they have been derived\nin a particular way. The more so since many arguments drawn in favour of a\ngiven analysis comes from data on child development and language learning. To\ninterpret the data coming from learning we need to have a theory of the internal\nknowledgeoflanguage(\u2018languagefaculty\u2019). Thisknowledgemayeitherconsistin\nrepresentationsandconditionsontherepresentations,orinfactinrepresentations\nplusasetofrules.\nThe discussion concerning the problem whether we should have rules or not\nwill probably go on forever. Optimality Theory (OT) adds a new turn to the\nissue. OT triestodo awaywithrules (thoughwe shallseethat thisis anillusion).\nAlso, rather than saying exactly which representations are legitimate it simply\nproposes a list a desiderata for an optimal result. If a result is not optimal, still it\nmay be accepted if it is the best possible among its kin. Thus, to begin, OT must\nposit two levels: underlying representation (UR) and surface representation\n(SR).WestartwiththeUR[b\u00e6td](/batted/). WhichnowistheSR?OTassumes\nthat we generate all possible competitors and rank them according to how many\nandhowoftentheyviolateagivenconstraint.\nHere is how it can work in the present situation.

But if it is underlyingly not empty, then we\nmustseeoneofitssegments.\nRecoverObstruency\nIf an underlying segment is an obstruent, it must be an obstruent in\ntheSR.

The idea is that one does not\nhave to satisfy all of them; but the more the better. An immediate idea is to do\nsomething like linear programming: for each constraint there is a certain penalty,\nwhich is \u2018awarded\u2019 on violation. For each violation, the corresponding penalty is\nadded. (In school it\u2019s basically the same: bad behaviour is punished, depending\non your behaviour you heap up more or less punishment.) Here however the\nviolation of a more valuable constraint cannot be made up for. No matter how\noften someone else violates a lesser valued constraint, if you violate a higher\nvaluedconstraint,youloose.\nTo make this more precise, for a pair hI,Oi of underlying representation (I)\nand a surface representation (O), we take note of which principles are violated.\nEach language defines a partial linear order on the constraints, such as the ones\ngiven above. It says in effect, given two constraintsC andC0, whetherC is more\nvaluablethanC0,orC0 ismorevaluablethanC,orwhethertheyareequallyvalu-\nable.\nNowsupposetheUR I isgiven:\n(cid:192) Suppose that \u03c0 = hI,Oi and \u03c00 = hI,O0i are such that for all constraints\nthat\u03c0violatesthereisamorevaluableconstraintthat\u03c00 violates. ThenOis\ncalledoptimalwithrespecttoO0.\n` Suppose that hI,Oi and \u03c00 = hI,Oi are such that C is the most valuable\nconstraint that \u03c0 violates; and that C is also the most valuable constraint\nthat \u03c00 violates. Then if \u03c00 violatesC more often than \u03c0, O is optimal with\nrespecttoO0. 76 Lecture6: PhonologyIV\n\u00b4 OisoptimalifitisoptimalwithrespecttoeveryotherpairwithsameUR.\nThe actual output form for I is the optimal output form for I.

(OT uses the following talk. O and O0 are called candidates\nandtheygetranked. However,candidacyisalwaysrelativetotheUR.)\nLet\u2019s apply this for [b\u00e6td].

Which one is correct if that can be\nsaid at all? And how do we count violations of rules? The first one violates\nthe principle that obstruents must be recoverable. The second does not; it does\nnot even violate adjacency! Of course, we may forbid that obstruents be deleted.\nBut note that languages do delete obstruents (Finnish does so to simplify onset\nclusters). Thus obstruents can be deleted, but we count that also as a violation of\nthe principle of recoverability of obstruents. Then the second pair violates that\nprinciple.

Howmanytimeshaveweviolated 78 Lecture6: PhonologyIV\nRuleC?Theideaofviolatingaconstraint3timesasopposedtooncemakeslittle\nsenseunlessweassumethatweapplycertainrules.\nNotes on this section. The transition from underlying /d/ to /t/, / @/ or /d/ has\nmostly been described as morphophonemics. This is a set of rules that control\nthe spelling of morphs (or morphemes?) in terms of phonemes. Under this view\nthere is one morph, which is denoted by, say, /PAST/ (where / \u00b7 / says: this\nM M\nis a unit of the morphological level) and there are rules on how to realise this\nmorphonthephonologicallevel(recallasimilardiscussiononthetransitionfrom\nthe phonological to the phonetic level). Under that view, the morph /PAST/ has\nM\nthree realisations. The problem with this view is that it cannot motivate the rela-\ntionship between these forms. Thus we have opted for the following view: there\nis one morph and it is realised as /d/ phonologically. It produces illicit phono-\nlogical strings and there are therefore rules of combination that project the illicit\ncombinationsintolicitones. Morphology I: Basic Facts\nMorphemes are the smallest parts that have meaning. Words may\nconsist of one or several morphemes in much the same way as they\nconsist of one or more syllables. However, the two concepts, that of\namorphemeandthatofasyllable,areradicallydifferent.\nWord Classes\nMorphology is the study of the minimal meaningful units of language. It studies\nthe structure of words, however from a semantic viewpoint rather than from the\nviewpoint of sound. Morphology is intimately related to syntax. For everything\nthat is larger than a word is the domain of syntax. Thus within morphology one\nconsiders the structure of words only, and everything else is left to syntax. The\nfirsttonoticeisthatwordscomeindifferentclasses. Forexample,thereareverbs\n(/to imagine/) and there are nouns (/a car/), there are adverbs (/slowly/) and\nadjectives (/red/). Intuitively, one is inclined to divide them according to their\nmeaning: verbs denote activities, nouns denote things adverbs denote ways of\nperforming an activities and adjectives denote properties. However, language has\nits own mind. The noun /trip/ denotes an activity, yet it is a noun. Thus, the\nsemantic criterion is misleading. From a morphological point of view, the three\naredistinctinthefollowingway. Verbstaketheendings/s/,/ed/,and/ing/,nouns\nonlytaketheending/s/. Adjectivesandadverbsontheotherhanddonotchange.\n(Theycanbedistinguishedbyothercriteria,though.)\n(104) We imagine.\n(105) He imagines.\n(106) We are imagining.\n(107) He imagined.\nThus we may propose the following criterion: a word w is a verb if and only if\nwecanadd[z](/s/),[d](/ed/)and[\u0131\u014b](/ing/andnothingelse;wisanounifand\nonlyifwecanadd[s](/s/)andnothingelse.\nThis distinction is made solely on the basis of the possibility of changing the\nform alone. The criterion is at times not so easy to use. Several problems must\nbe noted. The first is that a given word may belong to several classes; the test 80 Lecture7: MorphologyI\nusing morphology alone would class anything that is both a noun and a verb,\nfor example /fear/ as a verb, since the plural (/fears/), is identical to the third\nsingular. Changing the wording to replace \u2018if and only if\u2019 to \u2018if\u2019 does not help\neither. For then any verb would also be classed as a noun. A second problem\nis that there can be false positives; the word /rise/ [(cid:244)a\u0131z] cannot be taken as the\nplural of /rye/ [(cid:244)a\u0131]. And third, there some words do not use the same formation\nrules. Thereareverbsthatformtheirpasttensenotinthewaydiscussedearlier,by\nadding [d]. For example, the verb /run/ has no form \u2217/runned/. Still, we classify\nit as a verb. For example, the English nouns take a subset of the endings that the\nverb takes. The word /veto/ is both a noun and a verb, but this analysis predicts\nthat it is a verb. Therefore, more criteria must be used. One is that of taking a\ncontextandlookingwhichwordsfitintoit.\n(108) The governor the bill.\nIf you fill the gap by a word, it is certainly a verb (more exactly a transitive verb,\none that takes a direct object). On the other hand, if it can fill the gap in the next\nexampleitisanoun:\n(109) The vetoed the bill.\nWhen we say \u2018fill the gap\u2019 we do not mean however that what we get is a mean-\ningful sentence when we put in that word; we only mean that it is grammatically\n(=syntactically)well-formed. Wecanfillin/cat/,butthatstretchesourimagina-\ntion a bit. When we fill in /democracy/ we have to stretch it even further, and so\non.

(Affixes are\nparts that are not really words by themselves, but get glued onto words in some\nway. See Lecture 13 for details.) Table 11 shows a few English affixes and lists\nthe word classes to which it can be applied. We see that the list of affixes is\nheterogeneous, and that affixes do not always attach to all members of a class\nwith equal ease (/anti-house/, for example, is yet to be found in English). Still,\nthetestrevealsalotaboutthedivisionintodifferentwordclasses.

This makes it\npossible to create very large words. Those words or parts thereof that are not\ncomposed and must therefore be drawn from the lexicon are called roots. Roots\nare \u2018main\u2019 words, those that carry meaning. (This is a somewhat hazy definition.\nIt becomes clearer only through examples.) Affixes are not roots. Inflectional\nendings are also not roots. An example of a root is /cat/, which is form identical\nwiththesingular. However,thelatteralsohasawordboundarymarkerattheright\nand (so it looks more like (/cat#/, but this detail is often generously ignored). In\notherlanguages,rootsareclearlydistinctfromeveryformyougettoseeonpaper.\nLatin /deus/ \u2018god\u2019 has two parts: the root /de/, and the nominative ending /us/.\nThis can be clearly seen if we add the other forms as well: genitive /dei/, dative\n/deo/, accusative /deum/, and so on. However, dictionaries avoid using roots.\nInstead,youfindthewordsbytheircitationform,whichinLatinisthenominative\nsingular. So,youfindtherootinthedictionaryunder/deus/notunder/de/. (Just\nan aside: verbs are cited in their infinitival form; this need not be so. Hungarian\ndictionaries often list them in their 3rd singular form. This is because the 3rd 82 Lecture7: MorphologyI\nsingularrevealsmoreabouttheinflectionthantheinfinitive. Thissavesmemory!)\nThere are several distinct ways in which words get formed; moreover, lan-\nguages differ greatly in the extent to which they make use of them. The most\nimportantonesare\n(cid:192) compounding: two words, neither an affix, become one by juxtaposition.\nEachofthemisotherwisefoundindependently. Examplesare/goalkeeper/,\n/whistleblower/(verb+nouncompound),/hotbed/(adjective+noun).\n` derivation: only one of the parts is a word; the other is only found in com-\nbination, and it acts by changing the word class of the host. Examples are\ntheaffixeswhichwehavediscussedabove(/anti/,/dis/,/ment/).\n\u00b4 inflection: onepartisanindependentword,theotherisnot. Itdoeshowever\nnot change the category, it adds some detail to the category (inflection of\nverbsbyperson,number,tense...).\nCompounding\nIn English, a compound can be recognised by its stress pattern. For example, the\nmain stress in the combination adjective+noun is on the noun if they still form\ntwo words (black board [bl\u00e6k \"bO(cid:244)d]) while in a compound the stress is on the\nadjective (/blackboard [\"bl\u00e6kbO(cid:244)d]). Notice that the compound simply is one\nword,sotheadjectivehaslostitsstatusasadjectivethroughcompounding,which\nexplainsthenewstresspattern.\nInEnglish,compoundsaredisfavouredovermultiwordconstructions. Ithasto\nbe said, though, that the spelling does not really tell you whether you are dealing\nwithoneortwowords. Forexample,althoughonewrites/rest room/,thestress\npatternsoundsasifoneisdealingwithonlyoneword.\nThere are languages where the compounds are not just different in terms of Lecture7: MorphologyI 83\nstresspatternfrommultiwordconstructions. Germanissuchalanguage.\n(112) Regierung-s-entwurf\ngovernmentproposal\n(113) Schwein-e-stall\npigsty\n(114) R\u00e4d-er-werk\nwheelwork=mechanism\nThe compound /Regierungsentwurf/ not only contains the two words /Regie-\nrung/ (\u2018government\u2019) and /Entwurf/ (\u2018proposal\u2019), it also contains an \u2018s\u2019 (called\n\u2018Fugen s\u2019 = \u2018gap s\u2019). To make German worthwhile for students, what gets in-\nserted is not always an \u2018s\u2019 but sometimes \u2018e\u2019; /Schweinestall/ is composed\nfrom /Schwein/ and /Stall/. /R\u00e4derwerk/ is composed from /Rad/ and /Werk/.\n/Schweine/and/R\u00e4der/soundexactlyliketheplural,while/Regierungs/isnot\nlike any case form of /Regierung/. In none of these cases can the compound be\nmistakenforamultiwordconstruction.\nThe meaning of compounds often enough is not determinable in a strightfor-\nwardwayfromthemeaningofitsparts. Itischaracteristicofcompoundsthatthey\noften juxtapose some words and leave it open as to what the whole means (take\n/money laundry/ or /coin washer/, which are generally not places where you\nlaundermoneyorwashcoins;ifyoudidyouwouldbeinserioustrouble). Thisis\nmore true of noun+noun compounds than of verb+noun/noun+verb compounds,\nthough.\nSanskrit has far more compounds than even German. There is an entire clas-\nsificationofcompoundsintermsoftheirmakeupandmeaning.\nDerivation\nEnglish has a fair amount of derivational affixes. Table 11 shows some of them.\nWe said that derivation changes the category of the word; this is not necessar-\nily so. Thus it might be hard to distinguish derivation from inflection in that\ncase. However, derivation is optional (while inflection is not), and can be iter-\nated (inflection cannot be iterated). And, inflectional affixes are typically out-\nside derivational affixes. To give an example: you can form /republican/ from 84 Lecture7: MorphologyI\n/republic/. Tothisyoucanadd/anti/: /antirepublican/andfinallyformthe\nplural: /antirepublicans/. You could have added the \u2018s\u2019 to /republic/, but\nthen you could not go on with the derivation. There is no word \u2217/republicsan/.\nSimilarly, the word /antirepublics/ has only one derivation: first /anti/ is\naddedandthenthepluralsuffix. Whetherornotawordisformedbyderivationis\nnotalwaysclear. Forexample,is/reside/formedbyaffixation? Actually,itonce\nwas,butnowadaysitisnot. Thisisbecausewedonothaveaverb\u2217/side/except\nin some idioms. Thus, derivation may form words that initially are perceived as\ncomplex, but later lose their transparent structure. This maybe because they start\ntosounddifferentorbecausethebaseformgetslost. Nobodywouldguessthatthe\nword/nest/oncewasacomplexword\u2217/nizdo/(herethestarmeans: thisformis\nreconstructed),derivedfromthewords\u2217/ni/(\u2018down\u2019)and\u2217/sed/(\u2018sit\u2019).\nInflection\nTo fit a word into a syntactic construction, it may have to undergo some changes.\nIn English, the verb has to get an \u2018s\u2019 suffix if the subject is third person singular.\nThe addition of the \u2018s\u2019 does not change the category of the verb; it makes it more\nspecific, however. Likewise, the addition of past tense. Adding inflection thus\nmakes the word more specific in category, narrowing down the contexts in which\nitcanoccur.

Lecture8: SyntaxI 89\nWe call a sequence of words a constituent if (among other conditions) it can\nbe replaced by a single word. A second condition is that the sequence can be\ncoordinated. For example, we can replace /a fortune/ not only by /a lot/ but\nalso by /a fortune and a lot/.

A constituent C is an immediate constituent of\nanother constituent D if C is properly contained in D, but there is no constituent\nD0 such that C is properly contained in D0 and D0 is properly contained in D.\nOur sentence (119) has only two immediate subconstituents: /this villa/ and\n/costs a fortune/.

Each node is connected by a line to its imme-\ndiate subconstituents. These lines go down; a line going up is consequently from\na constituent to the constituent that it is an immediate part of. So, 8 and 9 are the\nimmediate constituents of 7, 6 and 7 are the immediate subconstituents of 3, and\nso on. It follows that 6, 7 and 8 are subconstituents of 3, which is to say that 3\nconsistsof/costs/,/a/and/fortune/.\nDefinition10 A tree is a pair hT,<i where T is a set and < is a set of pairs of\nelements from T such that (a) if x < y and x < z then either y < z, or y = z or\nz < y and (b) there is an element r such that x < r for all x , r (r is called the\nroot).\nThe tree in Figure 3 consists of the nodes 1,2,3,...,9 (we ignore the stuff below\nthem;thisconcernswordformsandisofnointeresttosyntax;weaddthesethings\nfor orientation only).

What if we choose the wrong one? Not all of\nthem work in all circumstances, so it is better to use something less imaginative\nbutsecure. Lecture8: SyntaxI 93\nIn case (cid:192) \u2013 \u02c6 are satisftied we say that h~u,~vi is a constituent occurrence of\n~x (in~z). This list is incomplete.

It is certainly true that the number of categories is large, but it has a\nhighlyregularstructurewhichweshallunravelinpartforEnglish.\nNow that we have defined the constituents, let us go back to our tree in Fig-\nure 3. Each of the nodes in that tree is a constituent, hence belongs to some\ncategory. Omitting some detail, the categories are given in Figure 4. (We call\nS a sentence, D a determiner, DP a determiner phrase, NP a noun phrase, VP a\nverb-phrase,Vverb.)\nContext Free Grammars\nNow look at Figure 4. If the labelling is accurate, the following should follow:\nany sequence of a determiner phrase followed by a verb phrase is a sentence.\nWhy is this so? Look at the tree.

Because it can be used no matter what the context is. However, notice\none difference, namely that the thing on the left is always a single symbol, denot-\ning a category, while the thing on the right is a sequence of symbols, which may\neach be either a category or a word. A grammar is a set of such rules, together\nwith a special symbol, called start symbol (usually S). Consider by way of the\nexamplethefollowinggrammar. ThestartsymbolisS,therulesare\n(149a) S \u2192 DP VP\n(149b) DP \u2192 D NP\n(149c) D \u2192 a | this\n(149d) NP \u2192 villa | fortune\n(149e) VP \u2192 V DP\n(149f) V \u2192 costs\nHere, the vertical stroke \u2018|\u2019 is a disjunction. It means \u2018can be either the one or\nthe other\u2019. For example, the notation D \u2192 a | this is a shorthand for two rules:\nD \u2192 aandD \u2192 this.\nThis grammar says that (119) is of category S. How does it do that? It says\nthat /this/ is a determiner (D; Rule (149c)), and /villa/ is a noun phrase (NP;\nRule(149d)).

An R-derivation is\nasequenceofstrings suchthateachlineisobtainedbythe previousbydoingone\nreplacement according to the rules of R.

Notice that the strings DP, VP, V and so\non are considered to be symbols; but they are not symbols of English. They are\ntherefore nonterminal symbols. Only nonterminal symbols may occur on the left\nofarule. Butnonterminalsymbolsmayoccurontheright,too.\nThe role of the start symbol is the following. A string of terminal symbols is\na sentence of the grammar if there is a derivation of it beginning with the start\nsymbol. Thelanguagegeneratedbythegrammaristhesetofallsentences(using\nonly terminal symbols!) that it generates. Ideally, a grammar for English should\ngenerate exactly those sentences that are proper English. Those grammars are\nincrediblyhardtowrite.\nNotes on this section. Let\u2019s return to our definition of constituent occurrence.\nContext free grammars provide strings with a constituent analysis. However, not\nevery such analysis conforms to the definition of constituents. To make every-\nthing fall into place we require that the grammars of English have the following Lecture8: SyntaxI 97\nuniversalruleschema. Foreverycategorysymbol X theycontainarule\n(151) X \u2192 X(cid:23)and(cid:23)X\nFurthermore,forevery X theymusthavearule\n(152) X \u2192 w~\nfor some word. If that is so, the criteria (cid:192) \u2013 \u02c6 will be met by all constituents\nassignedbythegrammar. Syntax II: Argument Structure\nWe shall introduce a general schema for phrase structure, called X-\nbar syntax. In X-bar syntax, every word projects a phrase consisting\nofuptotwoarguments,andanynumberofadjuncts.\nLexical Categories\nThere are several tens of thousands of categories in a language, maybe even mil-\nlions. Thus thenumber ofrulesthat wehave towriteis fartoo largeto bewritten\none by one. Thus, while in phonology the desire for general rules could still be\nthoughtofasnotsourgent,hereitbecomesabsolutelycentral. Weshallputtouse\nour notation of attribute value structures (AVSs). We start off with a few general\npurposerulesandthenrefinethemaswegoalong.\nFirst, words fall into roughly two handful of so-called lexical or major cat-\negories. The ones we shall be using are: noun (N), verb (V), adjective (A),\nadverb(Adv),preposition(P),complementizer(C),determiner(D),andtense\n(T).Notallclasseshavesinglewordsinthem,butmostofthemdo:\nN car,house,storm,insight\nV run,eat,hasten,crawl\nA greedy,raw,shiny,cheerful\n(153) Adv very,steadily,allegedly,down\nP in,for,about,below\nC that,which,because,while\nD a,the,this,those\nOurfirst attributeis\uf763\uf761\uf774,and ithasthe valuesjustdisplayed (sofar, theyareN, V,\nA,Adv,P,C,D,T).\nSubject and Object\nThe next distinction we want to make is that between a word and a phrase. We\nhave made that distinction earlier, when we called certain words determiners and\ncertain constituents DPs (= determiner phrases). The distinction is intimately Lecture9: SyntaxII 99\nconnected with the notion of argument structure. The argument structure tells us\nfor each word what kinds of constituents it combines with to form a phrase. Take\nthe verbs /run/ and /accuse/. The difference between the two is that the first is\nhappytocombinewithjustoneDP,say/the sailors/toformasentence,while\nthelatterisnot:\n(154) The sailors run.\n(155) \u2217The sailors accuse.\nTo make the latter into the sentence, you need to supply two more DPs, one for\ntheonewhoisaccusedandoneforwhatheisaccusedof:\n(156) The sailors accuse the captain of treason.\nWe say, /run/ takes one argument, /accuse/ takes three arguments. It means\nthatinordertogetagrammaticalsentence,/run/onlyneedstocombinewithone\nDP,/accuse/needsthree. (Therearedifferencesinthedegreetowhich/accuse/\nneedsanyoneofitsarguments;thisisamatterweshallnotgointo.)\nAs for verbs, they always have one argument in a sentence, and this is the\nsubject. The subject is that argument which is in the nominative case. You can\nrecognize it by the form of pronoun that you have to use. The subject is /she/,\n/he/, /it/, /I/, /you/, /they/ and not /her/, /him/, /me/, /us/ and /them/. (The\nform /you/ is both nominative and accusative, so we cannot use it for our test.)\nIf instead you have to use the accusative forms, you are looking at the (direct)\nobject.\n(157) They run./\u2217Them run.\n(158) They accuse the captain of treason.\n(159) \u2217Them accuse the captain of treason.\n(160) The sailors accuse us of treason.\n(161) \u2217The sailors accuse we of treason.\nUnlessadverbsarepresent,Englishputsthesubjectrightbeforetheverb,andthe\nobject right after it. So, this actually is another diagnostic for subject and object.\nThethirdargumentis/of treason/. Thisisformedbyusingapreposition(/of/),\nso it is called a PP (= preposition phrase). There are as many preposition phrases\nasthereareprepositions. Weshalldealwiththemalittlelater. 100 Lecture9: SyntaxII\nA verb is called intransitive if it has no direct object. Otherwise it is called\ntransitive. Hence, /run/ is intransitive, /accuse/ is transitive. Verbs may also be\nboth; /break/ and /eat/ can occur both with and without a direct object. Such a\nverbisbothtransitiveandintransitive;wesaythatitisused transitivelyifthereis\nadirectobject(asin(162)),andintransitivelyotherwise(asin(163)).\n(162) The children are eating the cake.\n(163) The children are eating.\nThedistinctionbetweentransitiveandintransitivetellsuswhetherornottheverb\nneedsadirectobjectasanargument.\nWeobservethatintransitiveverbsaredistributionallyequivalentwiththecom-\nbinationoftransitiveverb+directobject:\n\uf8f1 \uf8fc\n\uf8f1 \uf8fc \uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2 r la on s. \uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2 The child\nt the battle of Waterloo.\n(164) Napoleon\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3 \uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3 a it se beth ae utc ia fk ue l. \uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe\nMy neighbour\u2019s dog\n.\nThis tells us two things: transitive verbs plus (direct) objects form a constituent,\nandthisconstituentcanbereplacedbyanintransitiveverb.\nLinguists have therefore proposed the following scheme. Constituents have\ntwo attributes: a major category and a projection level. The levels are 0, 1, and\n2. They are also called bar levels (because they used to be denoted by overstrike\nbars). Othernotationis: D0fordeterminer,0level;D1,DorD0fordeterminerfirst\norintermediateprojection;andD2,DorD00fordeterminerlevel2,ordeterminer\nphrase. Words are uniformly assigned level 0, and phrases are level 2. So, what\nwe used to call a determiner (D) is now a D0, and the representation of it and a\ndeterminerphrase(DP)islikethis:\n\" # \" #\n\uf763\uf761\uf774 :D \uf763\uf761\uf774 :D\n(165) D0 = DP =\n\uf770\uf772\uf76f\uf76a:0 \uf770\uf772\uf76f\uf76a:2\nThe need for an intermediate level will become clear below.

Now, the rule (166) says that a sentence (=\nVP) is something that begins with a determiner phrase and then has a level 1 V.\n(167) is for intransitive verbs, (168) is for transitive verbs.

It is needed for indefinite plurals (the plural of /a\ncar/is/cars/). Lecture10: SyntaxIII 111\nThe choice of the determiner controls a feature of DPs that is sometimes syn-\ntactically relevant: definiteness. DPs are said to be definite if, roughly speaking,\ntheyrefertoaspecificentitygivenbythecontextoriftheyareuniquelydescribed\nby the DP itself. Otherwise they are called indefinite. The determiner of definite\nDPs is for example /this/, /that/ and /the/. The determiner of indefinite DPs is\nforexample/a/inthesingular,/some/insingularandplural,and\u2205intheplural.\nIn other languages, nouns have more features that are syntactically relevant.\nThe most common ones are case and gender. Latin, for example, has three gen-\nders, called masculine, feminine and neuter. In English the three genders have\nsurvived in the singular 3rd person pronouns: /he/, /she/, /it/. The Latin noun\n/homo/ (\u2018man\u2019) is masculine, /luna/ (\u2018moon\u2019) is feminine, and /mare/ (\u2018sea\u2019) is\nneuter. The adjectives have different forms in each case (notice that the adjective\nlikestofollowthenoun,butitdoesnothavetoinLatin):\n(220) homo ruber (redman)\n(221) luna rubra (redmoon)\n(222) mare rubrum (redsea)\nNounshavemanydifferentdeclensionclasses(morphologydealswiththem,syn-\ntaxdoesnot),andtherearerulesofthumbastowhatdeclensionclassnounshave\nwhich gender, but they can fail. Nouns ending in /a/ are generally feminine, but\nthere are exceptions (/nauta/ \u2018the seafarer\u2019, /agricola/ \u2018the farmer\u2019 are mascu-\nline). Similarly, adjectives have many declension paradigms, so the forms can\nvary. But for each adjective there are forms to go with a masculine noun, forms\ntogowithafemininenoun,andformstogowithaneuternoun. Wethereforesay\nthattheadjectiveagreesingenderwiththenoun.

Moreover, English\ngender is said to be semantic, that is, based on what a noun denotes. To know\nwhet.her you should use /he/, /she/ or /it/ you have to ask yourself whether the\nreferent is male, female, or neither. (The case where sex is unknown (or is not\nto be revealed by the speaker) is another case, and it is different from the case\nwhether the sex is known, or in fact the notion of sex does not apply, for example\nin the case of cars. In some variants of English, for example, /they/ is used to\navoidcommunicatingthesex,asopposedto/it/whenthenotiondoesnotapply.)\nThe semantics of gender is not fully congruent with sex; ships and other vessels\nare an exception in that you must use /she/ to refer to them, even though they\nhave no sex. This does not mean, though, that gender is not semantic; it means 112 Lecture10: SyntaxIII\nthat its meaning is not fully determined by sex. A different case is presented by\nGerman, where gender is demonstrably not fully semantic. All diminutives are\nneuter, regardless of what they refer to. In referring to a small man, for example,\nyou can either say /der kleine Mann/ (\u2018the-masc.nom.sg small man\u2019) or /das\nM\u00e4nnchen/(\u2018the-neut.sg.nomman-dimin\u2019).\nLatin nouns also have different cases. There are five cases in Latin: nomi-\nnative (for subjects), accusative (for direct objects), dative, genitive and ablative.\nJust as verbs select PPs with a particular preposition in English they can also se-\nlect a DP with a particular case. If it is accusative the verb is transitive; but it can\nbe dative (/placere/+DP[dat] \u2018to please someone\u2019), ablative (/frui/+DP[abl]\n\u2018to enjoy something\u2019), and genitive (/meminisse/+DP[gen] \u2018to remember some-\none/something\u2019). There exist verbs that take several DPs with various cases. For\nexample,/inferre/\u2018toinflict\u2019(withperfect/intuli/)wantsbothadirectobject\nandadativeDP.\n(223) Caesar Gallis bellum intulit.\nCaesarGauls-datwar-accinflict.upon-perf\nCaeserinflictedwarontheGauls.\nThisisjustlikeEnglish/inflict/,thatwantsadirectobjectandaPP[on].\nFor us, a grammatical feature is anything that defines a syntactic category.\nYou may think of it as the syntactic analogue of a phonemic feature. However,\nbeware that elsewhere the usage is a little different. Grammatical category and\nprojection level are typically discarded, so that grammatical feature refers more\nto the kinds of things we have introduced in this section above: number, gender,\ndefiniteness,andcase. Afifthoneisperson. (Thislistisnotexhaustive.)\nThe position of subject can be filled with DPs like /the mouse/, /a car/, but\nalsobyso-calledpronouns. Pronounsaredistinctfromnounsinthattheyexpress\nlittle more than that they stand in for a DP. However, they have many different\nforms, depending on the grammatical feature. In addition they show a distinction\nin person. Across languages, there is a pretty universal system of three persons:\n1st, 2nd, and 3rd. First person means: includes speaker. Second person means:\nincludes hearer, and third person means: includes neither speaker nor hearer. So,\n/I/ is first person (it includes me and no one else); it is also singular, because\nit refers to just one thing. The plural /we/ is used when one refers to several\npeople, including speaker. By contrast, /you/ is used for individuals or groups Lecture10: SyntaxIII 113\nincludingthehearer(thereisnodistinctionbetweensingularandplural). Thethird\npersonpronounsdistinguishalsogenderinthesingular(/he/,/she/,/it/),butnot\nin the plural (/they/). Moreover, as we explained above, pronouns distinguish\nnominative from accusative. Thus, there are more morphological distinctions in\nthepronominalsysteminEnglishthanthereisintheordinaryDPs.\nMore on Case\nCases have many different functions. One function is to indicate the nature of\nthe argument. A verb has a subject, and the case of the subject is referred to as\nnominative. The direct object has a case that is referred to as accusative. Some\npeople believe that English has cases (because pronouns still reflect a distinction\nbetween subject and object: /she/ : /her/, /he/ : /him/, and so on). On the other\nhand, this is confined to the pronouns, and nouns show no distinction in case\nwhatsoever. This is why we say that English has no case. Strictly speaking, it\nmeans only that there is no distinction in case. (One might say: there is one case\nandonlyone. Thisisuseful. Forexample,thereisafamousprincipleofsyntactic\ntheory which states that nouns need case. If there is no case, this principle fails.)\nChinese is another example of a language that has no cases. These languages\nmakenodistinctionbetweensubjectandobjectinform;nevertheless,onecantell\nthe difference: the subject precedes the verb, and the object follows it (both in\nEnglishandinChinese).\nVerbs can have more than two arguments, and many more adjuncts. To dis-\ntinguish between them some kind of marking is needed. In English this is done\nbymeansofprepositions. Forexample,thereoftenisanargumenttowardswhich\nthe action is directed or for which it is performed (the \u2018goal\u2019) and it is given by\na PP opened by /to/ (= PP[to], for example /talk to someone/). The goal is\nalso called indirect object. Latin has a case for this, the dative. There is from a\nglobal viewpoint not much of a difference whether the goal is encoded by a case\norbyaPP.Languagescanchoosewhichwaytogo.\nAnother important case is the genitive. It marks possession. English has\nbasically two ways to mark possession (apart from obvious ones like /which\nbelongs to/). One is the so-called Anglo-Saxon genitive, formed by adding\nan /\u2019s/ (/my neighbour\u2019s car/). The other is a PP opened by /of/ (/the car\nof my neighbour/). The genitive is used a lot in English. Nouns that have ar- 114 Lecture10: SyntaxIII\ngumentsthatarenotPPsputtheminthegenitive:\n(224) the election of the chancellor\n(225) the peak of the mountain\n(226) Napoleon\u2019s destruction of the city\nNoticethattwoofthesenounshavebeenobtainedfromtransitiveverbs.

Theverb/talk/takesasubject,anindirect\nobject and subject matter, expressed by a PP headed by /about/. The latter two\nare inherited as is by the noun /talk/, while the subject is put in the genitive.\nAlternatively,itcanbeexpressedbyaPP[by].\n(227) John talked to his boss about the recent layoffs.\n(228) John\u2019s talk to his boss about the recent layoffs\n(229) talk by John to his boss about the recent layoffs\nSubject-Verb Agreement\nEnglishdisplaysaphenomenoncalledsubject-verbagreement.

Furthermore, agreement features are exempt\nfromtheidentityrequirementincoordination:\n(254) John and Mary danced.\n(255) William and the firemen saluted the governor. Syntax IV: Movement and Non-Local Dependencies\nEven though there is a way to account for the syntax of questions in\ntermsofcontextfreerules,byfarthemostefficientanalysisisinterms\nof transformations. Typically, a transformation is the movement of a\nconstituent to some other place in the tree. This lecture explores how\nthisworksandsomeoftheconditionsunderwhichthishappens.\nMovement\nWe have learned that in English the transitive verb requires its direct object im-\nmediately to its right. This rule has a number of exceptions. The first sentence\nbelow, (256), displays a construction known as topicalisation, the second, (257),\nisasimplequestionusingaquestionword.\n(256) Air pilots Harry admires.\n(257) Which country have you visited?\nWecouldofcoursegiveuptheideathatthedirectobjectistotherightoftheverb.\nIt would be possible to argue for topicalisation that the sentence has the structure\nObject-Subject-Verb. But the facts are quite complex, especially when we turn\nto questions. For example, no matter what kind of constituent the question word\nreplaces(subject,object,indirectobjectandsoon),itisatthefirstplaceevenifit\nisnotthesubject.\n(258) Alice has visited Madrid in spring to learn Spanish.\n(259) What has Alice visited in spring to learn Spanish?\n(260) Who has visited Madrid in spring to learn Spanish?\n(261) When has Alice visited Madrid to learn Spanish?\n(262) Why has Alice visited Madrid in spring?\nWe see that the sentences involving question words differ from (258) in that the\nquestion word is in first place and the verb in second place. There is a way to\narrive at a question in the following way. First, insert the question word where it\noughttobelongaccordingtoourpreviousrules.

It is typically\nneither visible nor audible.) The first notation is more explicit in showing you\nwhich element came from where (assuming they are all different). However, nei-\nther notation reveals the order in which the movements have applied. It turns out,\nthough, that this is irrelevant anyhow. (The tree structures do not reveal much\nabout the derivation of a sentence either, and that is mostly considered irrelevant\ndetailanyway.)\nThe good side about this proposal is that it is actually simple. However, we\nneed to be clear about what exactly we are doing. For it seems that what we do\nis derive one surface sentence of English from another surface sentence of En-\nglish. (Thiswasinfactthewaytransformationswereoriginallythoughtof.) Here\nhowever we pursue a different conception, namely that every surface sentence of\nEnglish is derived in a two stage process. First, we generate a structure in which\neveryheadprojectsitsphrase,satisfyingitsrequirements(suchasverbsprojecting\na VP consisting of a subject and, if transitive, an object, and the necessary PPs).\nAfter that is taken care of, we shall apply a few transformations to the structure\nto derive the actual surface string. This is what we have done with phonological\nrepresentations, too. First we have generated deep representations and then we\nhave changed them according to certain rules.

In addition to this there is also move-\nment of zero level projections, or heads. (It is therefore called head movement.)\nA particular example is verb movement. Many languages display a phenomenon\ncalled Verb Second or V2. German is among them. Unlike English, the verb is Lecture11: SyntaxIV 123\nnot always in second place. Here is a pair of sentences with word-to-word trans-\nlation.\n(277) Hans geht in die Oper.\nHansgoesintotheopera\n(278) Der Lehrer ist erfreut, weil Hans in die Oper geht.\ntheteacherispleased,becauseHansintotheoperagoes\nThe main verb is /geht/ (\u2018goes\u2019). In the first example it is in second place, in the\nsecondexampleitisattheendofthesentence. Noticethatinthesecondexample\nthere is a CP which is opened by /weil/ (\u2018because\u2019). It is called subordinate,\nbecause it does not display the same kind of order as a typical clause. Now one\nmaysuspectthattheverbsimplyoccupiesadifferentplaceinsubordinateclauses.\nHowever,ifwelookatanauxiliaryplusamainverb,mattersstarttobecomemore\ncomplex.\n(279) Hans will in die Oper gehen.\nHanswantsintotheoperago\n(280) Der Lehrer ist erfreut, weil Hans in die Oper gehen\nwill.\ntheteacherispleased,becauseHansintotheoperagowants\nOnly the auxiliary (/will/) is found in the second place in the main clause. More\nfacts can be adduced to show the following. The verb is at the end of the clause\nin deep structure. In a subordinate clause it stays there. Otherwise it moves to\nsecondposition.\nNow, what exactly is \u2018second position\u2019? It cannot be the second word in the\nsentence. Inthenextexampleitisthefifthword(thedotinthetranscriptionshows\nthat/im/istranslatedbytwowords: \u2018in\u2019and\u2018the\u2019).\n(281) Der Frosch im Teich ist kein Prinz.\nthefrogin.thepondisnoprince\nObviously, it is not the second word, it is the second constituent of the sentence.\nOnce again we find that the operation of movement is not described in terms of\nstringsbutintermsofthestructure.\nEnglish has a phenomenon similar to this. Notice that I said the subject is\nin the specifier of VP. That works fine for a simple tense but creates word order 124 Lecture11: SyntaxIV\nproblems for complex tenses. For we would like to posit that /will/ is a tense\nhead (so here is one of the words that go into T0). If that is so, the basic structure\nisthis.\n(282) [[\u2205 [[will [John [see Alice] V0] VP] T0] TP] C0]\nCP\nThisgivesusthefollowingbaseorder.\n(283) will John see Alice\nThistimeitisthesubject,however,thatmovestospecifierofTP,sothatweget\n(284) [[\u2205 [[John will [ see Alice] VP] T0] TP] C0]\nCP\nThis is now extended to all kinds of clauses as follows. We propose that T0 con-\nsistsof tenseandsubjectagreement. Howcan thisbe? Inthefuturetense wesay,\nfor example, /will see/, while in the present tense we say /sees/. Blurring the\ndistinction between syntax and morphology, we segment /sees/ into /see/ and\n/s/, the latter the exact equivalent of /will/. We propose therefore that /will/ as\nwellas/s/areT0 heads.\nThus,byanalogy,theoriginalpresenttensesentenceisthis:\n(285) [[\u2205 [[s [John [see Alice] V0] VP] T0] TP] C0]\nCP\nThus we discover another reason for movement: morphological integrity. The\nagreementmorpheme/s/cannotsurvivebyitself,andtheverbmovesuptoattach\ntoit.\n(286) [\u2205 [\u2205 [[see+s [John [ Alice] V0] VP] T0] TP] C0]\nCP\nWeshallconcernourselveswiththeexactstructureof/see+s/.\nThus, we propose that across the board the V0 is void of any tense and in-\nflectional feature; while the future tense and negation require a separate T0 in the\novert sentence, present tense and past tense only have one word. For example,\nsince /saw/ is the past tense of /see/, we analyse it as /see+PAST+3Sg/. The\nsequence /PAST+3Sg/ is hosted in T0, and the root /see/ moves up to compose\nwithit.\n(287) [[PAST+3Sg[John see Mary] VP] T0]\nTP\n(288) [[see+PAST+3Sg[John Mary] VP] T0]\nTP\n(289) [John [see+PAST+3Sg[ Mary] VP] T0]\nTP Lecture11: SyntaxIV 125\nThere are various other reasons why this is a good analysis, having to do with\nplacement of negation and adverbs. On the other hand, it raises questions about\nthe compatibility of categories; for we require that after movement the categorial\nstructureisstillinaccordancewithX-barsyntax,soVmuststillprojectaVP,not\naCP.Ispellthisprincipleoutinfull.\nCategorialTransparency\nThestructureobtainedaftermovementmustconformtoX-barsyntax.\nSince the movement of the verb into T0 does not change any projections (it is\njust movement of a constituent), we will retain a T0 node, and so the head of this\nphrasemuststillbeaT.Thereisafixforthisproblem,whichIshalldiscussbelow\n(but it is not part of this lecture). Notice that that the T0 contains material in it.\nMoreover, when the verb moves, it does not replace the material but rather adds\nitself on the left of it. The resulting string is therefore still of the same category.\nWeshallatthedetailsofthislater.\nThedancenowcontinues. Whenaquestionisformed,notonlydoestheques-\ntion word (or the phrase containing it) move to first position, also the auxiliary\ndoes move next to it. For rather than just getting (291) by moving /what/, we get\n(292),whichresultsinasecondmovement,oftheauxiliary/have/.\n(290) [[\u2205 [you will [ see what] VP] TP] C0]\nCP\n(291) [what [\u2205 [you will [ see ] VP] TP] C0]\nCP\n(292) [what [will+\u2205 [you [ see ] VP] TP] C0]\nCP\nTheevidenceisclear(onthebasisofwhatwehavesaidsofar)thatthetensehead\n/will/ must also move.

Whatever the\nend result, it must conform again to X-bar syntax. We have to begin with an\nimportant definition. Recall that a tree is a pair hT,<i, where T is a set, the set of\nnodes and < the relation \u2018is (properly) dominated by\u2019. (I use \u2018is dominated by\u2019\nsynonymously with \u2018is properly dominated by\u2019. This relation is never reflexive:\nno node dominates itself.) x and y are said to be comparable if x = y or x < y\nor x > y. (Thus, x can be found from y by either following the lines upwards or\nfollowingthemdownwards.)\nDefinition12 Let hT,<i be a tree and x,y \u2208 T be nodes. x c-commands y if and\nonlyif x andyarenotcomparableandthemotherof x dominatesy.\nThis can be phrased differently as follows. x c-commands y if x is sister to z and\ny is below z (or identical to it). Thus, c-command is with any sister and its heirs.\nRecall the tree from Lecture 8, repeated here as Figure 5. Here is a complete list\nofwhichnodesc-commandwhichothernodes:\nc-commands\n1 \u2212\n2 3,6,7,8,9\n3 2,4,5\n4 5\n(298)\n5 4\n6 7,8,9\n7 6\n8 9\n9 8\nTherelationofc-commandisinheritedbythestringsthatcorrespondtothenodes.\nFor example, /this villa/ c-commands /costs a fortune/ and its subcon-\nstituents.

It can go there only if the node is absent.\nThus,movementcreatesitsownconstituent,butitmusttosoinagreementwithX-\nbar syntax.

Firstofall,bythefactsweneedtoassumethat/sees/,whichisthesame\nas /see+s/, actually is again a T0. On the other hand, /see/ is a V0, and /s/ is a\nT0. Thusweseemstohavethisstructure:\n(306) [see s ]\nV0 T0 T0\nThis is exactly what we shall propose. We shall supplement our X-bar with one\nmore rule, which covers the above case. Namely, we shall allow adjunction also\nto zero level projections; however, adjunction is only on the left, and only zero\nlevel projections can adjoin. The result is again a zero level projection (since this\nisadjunction):\n(307) X0 \u2192 Y0 X0\nAdditionally, we require that when a head is moved it must move to the next c-\ncommanding head and adjoin there. Adjunction is a movement that splits up a\nsingle node of category X into two nodes with category X, the upper one having\nthe moved constituent and the lower X node as its daughters. It is clear that the\nrule (307) makes adjunction to heads an option. Let us perform this step with\nFigure7. Noticethatweshouldnowconsiderthatallheadsintheinitialstructure\nare filled by either some lexical material or by a phonetically empty head (as we\nhave effectively required).

This provides coherence to a text. Binding\ntheory is about the interpretation of pronouns as well as the way in\nwhichtheycanbelinkedtootherparthsofthesentence. Keyconcepts\narePrinciplesA,BandC inadditiontoc-command andbinding.\nPronouns\nIn this chapter we shall look at a phenomenon that is most intimately connected\nwith c-command, namely binding. Binding is, as we shall see, as much of a\nsemantic phenomenon as a syntactic one, but we shall ignore its semantic as-\npects as much as we can. What is at issue is that there are several different kinds\nof DPs: ordinary DPs, names and pronouns. Pronouns can be either reflexive\n(like /myself/, /yourself/ etc.) or not (/he/, /she/, etc.). In addition, there are\nalso reciprocals (/each other/). In generative grammar, the term anaphor is\nusedtorefertobothreciprocalsandreflexivesbutthisisnottheusageelsewhere,\nwhere an anaphor is an expression that refers to something that another expres-\nsion already refers to (and therefore also nonreflexive pronouns generally counts\nasanaphors).\nIn English, the reflexive pronouns exist only in the accusative. There is no\n\u2217/hisself/,forexample. (Thepronoun/her/canbothbegenitiveandaccusative,\nso /herself/ is not a good text case. On the other hand, it is /ourselves/ and\nnot \u2217/usselves/. English has not been complelety consistent in arranging its\ncase system.) There additionally are demonstratives (/this/, /that/), relative\npronouns(/who/,/what/,/which/),whichareusedtoopenarelativeclause.\n(308) I could not find the CD [which you told me about].\n(309) There is a new film [in which no one ever talks].\nThe enclosed constituents are called relative clauses. They are used to modify\nnouns, for example. In that they are like adjectives, but they follow the noun in\nEnglishratherthanprecedingit.\n(310) \u2217I could not find the which you told me about CDs.\n(311) \u2217There is a new in which no one ever talks film. Lecture12: SyntaxV 135\nThe relative clause is opened by a relative pronoun, /which/, together with the\npreposition that takes the pronoun as its complement. One should strictly distin-\nguish the relative pronoun from the complementiser /that/ as found in sentential\ncomplements (/believe that/). The complementiser occupies a different posi-\ntion(C0). Somerelativeclausescanbeopenedby/that/.\n(312) I could not find the CD [that you told me about].\nThis use of /that/ seems to be a hybrid between the complementiser and a rela-\ntive pronoun (recall that /that/ is also a demonstrative). (And syntacticians are\ndivided on the question whether to call it a relative pronoun or a complemen-\ntiser in this usage.) The relative pronoun, for example, can move together with\nits preposition (/the film in which I played piano/), but you cannot say\n/the film in that I played piano/; instead, you have to say /the film\nthat I played piano in/. Typically, a relative clause either has a relative\npronoun or a complementiser; this has become an iron rule of generative gram-\nmar (\"Doubly filled COMP filter\"). But facts are different. Some dialects of\nGerman give us evidence that the relative pronoun and the complementiser really\ncan cooccur. In Suebian, /wo/ is used as a complementiser for relative clauses,\naccompaniedbyarelativepronoun.\n(313) die Leit die wo beim Daimler schaffet\nthepeoplewhothatat.theDaimlerwork\nthepeoplewhoworkattheDaimlerBenzfactory.\nAswithquestionsweliketothinkoftherelativeclausesasbeingderivedfrom\nastructureinwhichtherelativepronounisintheplacewheretheverbexpectsit.\n(314) the CD [\u2205 you told me about which]\n(315) a new film [\u2205 no one ever talks in which]\nThe position of specifier of CP is vacant, and the relative pronoun wants to move\nthere. (The position of C is also empty, but we like to think that there is a silent\nC that sits there. Anyway, phrases can never go there.) Sometimes the relative\npronoun goes alone (being a DP, hence a phrase, it can do that), sometimes it\ndrags the P along. The latter is known as Pied-Piping, from the fairy tale of the\npiperwhopromisedthecitytogetridoftherats...\nDifferent languages have different systems.

In(319)thetwooccurrencesof/John/aresupposedtopoint\nto the same individual. If they are supposed to point to different individuals, we\nwritedifferentnumbers:\n(326) John votes for John in the election.\n1 2\nThe numbers are devices to tell us whether some constituent names the same in-\ndividualassomeotherconstituent,orwhetheritnamesadifferentone.\nPronounsseemtoencourageadifferencebetweensubjectandobjectin(320),\nand similarly with names (321). However, things are tricky. In (327) the pronoun\n/his/ can be taken to refer not only to someone different from John, but also to\nJohnhimself. Andsimilarlyin(328). (Justanaside: thereflexivescannotbeused\nin genitive, they only have accusative forms. This may be the reason why we do\nnotfindthemhere,butthetheorywearegoingtooutlineheretriesadifferentline\nofargumentation.)\n(327) His lack of knowledge worried John.\n(328) He looks at himself in the mirror.\nSo, it is not really the case that when we have a pronoun that it must be used to\ntalk about a different person than the others in the sentence (= that it must have a\ndifferentindex).\nThe conditions that regulate the distribution of these expressions are at fol-\nlows. First,wedefinethenotionofbinding. 138 Lecture12: SyntaxV\nDefinition13 A constituent X binds another constituent Y if X c-commands Y\nand X andY havethesameindex.\nBinding is an interesting mixture between semantical conditions (carrying the\nsame index, hence talking about the same individual) and purely structural ones\n(c-command). A note of warning is in order. Constituents are strings, but we talk\nhere as if they are nodes in a tree. This confusion is harmless. What we mean to\nsay is this: suppose that x and y are nodes and the corresponding constituents are\nX and Y. Then if x c-commands y and has the same index, then x binds y, and\nX binds Y. So, X binds Y if there are nodes x and y such that x binds y and X is\nthe constituent of x and Y the constituent of y. Now we are ready to say what the\nconditionsonindexingare.\nPrincipleA.\nA reflexive pronoun must be bound by a constituent of the same CP\n(orDP).\nPrincipleB.\nApronounmustnotbeboundbyaconstituentinsidethesameCP.\nPrincipleC.\nAnamemustnotbebound.\nFor example, (319) can be used successfully to talk about two individuals named\nJohn. So,theexpressionaloneisnotsufficienttoruleoutasentence. Buttherules\ndotellussometimeswhatthepossiblemeaningsare.\nTounderstandtheroleofc-command,weneedtolookatthestructureofsome\nsentences. The subject c-commands the object of the same verb, since smallest\nconstituentcontainingthesubjectistheVP,whichalsocontainstheobject. How-\never, the object does not c-command the subject, since the smallest constituent\ncontaining it is only the V0. So the following is illegitimate no matter what in-\ndicesweassign:\n(329) \u2217Himself voted for John.\nThe subject also c-commands all other arguments. This accounts for the correct-\nnessofthefollowing.\n(330) The queen was never quite sure about herself.\n(331) The students were all talking to themselves. Lecture12: SyntaxV 139\nNotice that the principles not only say that these sentences are fine, they also tell\nusabouttheassignmentofindices. Theyclaimthat (332)isfinebut (333)isnot.\n(332) The queen was never quite sure about herself .\n1 1\n(333) \u2217The queen was never quite sure about herself .\n1 2\nThis is because the reflexive (/herself/) must be bound inside the sentence; this\nmeanstheremustbesomeantecedentc-commandingithavingthesameindex. In\n(332)itis/the queen/,butin(333)thereisnosuchconstituent. Thus,theoverall\ngeneralizationseemstobegood. NoticethatPrincipleAsaysthatthebindermust\nbeinthesameclause. Thusthefollowingcontrastisexplained.\n(334) [John thinks [that Alice likes herself.] ]\nCP CP\n(335) \u2217[John thinks [that Alice likes himself.] ]\nCP CP\nInboth(334)and(335),thereflexivepronounmustbeboundinsidethelowerCP,\nbyPrincipleA.However,theonlybindercanbe/Alice/,andnot/John/,andthus\n(335)isungrammatical.\nNow we look at pronouns. The situation where a pronoun should not be used\nin the same sentence is when actually a reflexive would be appropriate according\nto Principle A. For example, the following sentences are ruled out if meant to be\ntalking about the same individual(s) in the same sentence (that is, if /her/ refers\nto/the queen/and/them/refersto/the students/).\n(336) \u2217The queen was never quite sure about her .\n1 1\n(337) \u2217The students were all talking to them .\n1 1\nBythesametoken,ifweusenumberswecanalsowrite:\n(338) \u2217The queen was never quite sure about herself .\n1 2\n(339) \u2217The students were all talking to themselves .\n1 2\nHere, different numbers mean that the expressions are meant to refer to different\nindividuals or groups. Principle B talks about binding inside the same CP. It does\nnotexcludethatapronounisboundinahigherCP.Thisisborneout.\n(340) [John thinks [that Alice likes him .] ]\n1 3 1 CP CP\n(341) 140 Lecture12: SyntaxV\nNotice that the contrast between a reflexive and a nonreflexive pronoun only\nmatters when the antecedent is c-commanding the pronoun. We repeat (327) be-\nlow:\n(342) His lack of knowledge worried John .\n1/2 1\nHere,/John/istheantecedent. WecantakethesentencetomeanthatJohniswor-\nried about his own lack of knowledge, or that he is worried about someone else\u2019s\nlackofknowledge. Innoneofthecaseswouldareflexivepronounbeappropriate.\nLetusnowchangethepositionofthetwo:\n(343) \u2217John \u2019s lack of knowledge worried himself .\n1 1\nHere, /John/ does not c-command the pronoun. But the reflexive must be bound\nby something that c-commands it inside the clause. This can only be /John\u2019s\nlack of knowledge/. But if we think that, we would have to say /itself/\nratherthan/himself/. Next,whyis(344)fine?\n(344) John \u2019s lack of knowledge worried him .\n1 1\nEven though it has the same index as /John/, it is not c-commanded, hence not\nbound by it. Having the same index nevertheless means that they refer to the\nsame thing (John), but for syntax binding takes place only if c-command holds in\naddition. Hence,thenextsentenceisalsofineforsyntax:\n(345) John \u2019s lack of knowledge worried John .\n1 1\nAdmittedly, we would prefer (346) over (345), but it is agreed that this is not a\nsyntacticissue.\n(346) His lack of knowledge worried John .\n1 1\nMovement Again\nWe have argued earlier that an element can move only into a position that c-\ncommands the earlier position. It seems that binding theory could be used in\nthis situation. However, in order to use binding theory, we need to have an ele-\nment that is being bound. Recall from previous discussions that when an element Lecture12: SyntaxV 141\nmoves it leaves behind an empty element. But why is that so? To see this, look at\nmovementfromoutofasubordinateclause.\n(347) Who do you think answered which question?\n(348) \u2217Who do you think which question answered?\nIn these sentences, it is the subject of the subordinate clause which moves to the\nspecific of CP of the main clause. If that was all that happened, we would expect\nthat the specifier of the subordinate CP would be empty and so the object /which\nquestion/wouldhavetomoveintoit. Butthisisnotthecase. Thusweconclude\nthat the specifier of the lower CP is not empty. It is filled by something that we\ncannothear. Thatthingistheelementthat/who/leftbehind,whenitmovedtothe\nhigher specifier. So the full proposal is this: movement of a wh-phrase must be\nfirst to the specifier of CP of the same clause. After that it is to the specifier of\nCP of the next higher clause; and so on. Each time it moves, it leaves behind an\nempty element, called a trace. The constituent in the new position and the trace\nwill be coindexed. Finally, we declare that traces are some sort of pronouns, and\nhencemustbebound.\nConditiononTraces.\nAlltracesmustbebound.\nIfweassumethismuchitfollowsthatmovementmustinevitablybeintoaposition\nthatc-commandstheoriginalposition. Itdoessomethingelse,too. Itensuresthat\nwhatever thing we choose to interpret the moved element by, it will be used to\ninterpretthetrace.\n(349) Air pilots Harry admires t .\n1 1\nTherelevantstructureof (347)isnowasfollows.\n(350) [Who do you think [t [answered [t t which\n1 1 2 1 2\nquestion] TP] C0] CP]\nCP\nThe t in specifier of CP blocks movement of /which question/ into. However,\n1\nsince movement there is impossible, it is also not required, so the sentence is\ngrammatical.\nOne may wonder why this is a good theory. It postulates empty elements\n(traces), so how can we be sure that they exist? We do not see them, we do not 142 Lecture12: SyntaxV\nhear them, so we might as well assume that they do not exist. Furthermore, (349)\nisnotthesentenceweshallseeinprintorhear,sothisactuallyaddsstructurethat\nisseeminglysuperfluous.\nOpinions on this diverge. What is however agreed is that empty elements are\nvery useful. We have used them occasionally to save our neck. When nouns\nget transformed into verbs, no change is involved. Other languages are not so\nliberal,soitisnotthenatureofnounsandverbsthatallowsthis.

Youwillnodoubtfindmoreoccasionsonwhichwehavemade\nuseofemptyelements.\nBinding And Agreement\nPronouns distinguish not only case and number but also gender in English. Cru-\ncially, when a pronoun becomes bound it must agree in number and gender with\nitsbinder(notincasethough).\n(351) John voted for himself.\n(352) \u2217John voted for herself.\n(353) \u2217John voted for themselves.\n(354) The committee members voted for themselves.\n(355) Mary voted for herself.\nThe fact that agreement holds between binder and pronoun means that certain\nindexationsarenotlicit. Hereisanexample.\n(356) \u2217Her lack of knowledge worried John .\n1 1\n(357) \u2217Their disinterest in syntax bothered John .\n1 1\nAlso,wehavesaidthatapronouncannotbeboundinsidethesameCP.Butitcan\nbeboundoutsideofit:\n(358) John told his boss that he looked good.\n1 2 1/2\nIn the previous example, both indices are licit, since binding by /John/ or by\n/boss/ is compatible with agreement. However, in the following sentence one of Lecture12: SyntaxV 143\ntheoptionsisgone.\n(359) John told Mary that she looked good.\n1 2 \u22171/2\nFor if the pronoun is bound by /John/, it must agree with it in gender, which it\ndoesnot. Soitcanonlybeboundby/Mary/. Morphology II: Similarities and Dissimilarities to Syn-\ntax. Representational Issues\nWe return to morphology. We shall investigate the possible shapes\nof morphs and then turn to the question in what ways morphology is\ndifferent from syntax. At the end we shall return to the issue of head\nmovementandthestructureofcomplexheads.\nMorphs and Morphemes\nBefore we begin, a few words on terminology. As I already said in the introduc-\ntion, we distinguish between a morph and a morpheme. This conflicts to some\ndegreewiththeterminologyofDefinition3. Ishallnotattempttoresolvethecon-\nflicthere. Sufficeittosaythatwethinkinthischapterofmorphsandmorphemes\nas units in the same way as phones (= sounds) and morphemes.

Which morph is used in a particular case depends on\nthe noun to which we apply the morpheme. At the deep morphology we only\nsee a combination of a noun root with the one plural morpheme. At the surface\nhoweverweseethattherootwechooseinfluenceswhatmorphistobeusedinthe\nconstruction.\nKinds of Morphological Processes\nIn syntax we have said that words or constituents are simply concatenated. The\nonly choice is therefore in which order we concatenate them. In morphology\nthis is not always so. We shall review a few ways in which two morphs can be\ncomposed. The general term for grammatical morphs is affix. Generally, an affix\nto a string ~x is a string~y that puts itself somewhere in ~x. Given the terminology\nbelow,itiseitheraprefix,asuffixoraninfix. Somewritersuseitinamoregeneral 146 Lecture13: MorphologyII\nsense, butwe shall notdo that. Morphs are notalways affixes, however. Amorph\nneed not be a piece (= string) that we add somewhere; it may be several pieces\n(transfix, circumfix), or simply a certain kind of change effected on the string in\nquestion (like vowel change). The general term for all of these is morphological\nchange. We shall give a few examples of what kinds of morphological changes\nthereareinthelanguagesoftheworld.\nSuffixes and Prefixes\nA suffix is a string that is added at the end, a prefix is a string that is added at\nthe beginning. English has mostly suffixes (derivational ones like /ation/, /ize/,\n/ee/;inflectionaloneslike/s/and/d/). Butitalsohasprefixes: /de/,/re/,/un/are\nprefixes. It is generally agreed that\u2014if we use an analogy with syntax here\u2014the\naffix is the head, and that it either expects the string on its right (prefix) or on its\nleft(suffix).\nIf there were only suffixes and prefixes, morphology would look like syntax.\nUnfortunately,thisisnotthecase.\nCircumfixes\nA circumfix consists of a part that is being added before the word and another\nthat is added thereafter. It is thus a combination of prefix and suffix. The German\nperfect is a circumfix. It consists in the prefix /ge/ and a suffix which changes\nfromstemtostem(usuallyitis/en/or/t/). Theinfinitiveisasuffix/en/ascanbe\nseenfromthetablebelow.\nInfinitive Root Perfect\nsehen seh gesehen\n(360) back back gebacken\nfilmen film gefilmt\nhausen haus gehaust\nThe two parts (the prefix and the suffix) are historically of different origin (the\nprefix /ge/ did not exist originally, and in English you do not have it). It present\ndayGerman,however,thereisnosenseintakingthetwoseparate.

We have /frumos/ (\u2018beautiful\u2019) in\nthe positive, /mai frumos/ (\u2018more beautiful\u2019) in the comparative, and /cel mai\nfrumos/ (\u2018most beautiful\u2019). However, whether or not the superlative can be seen\nas being formed from the comparative by adding a prefix depends on the possi-\nbilitytodecomposethemeaningofthesuperlativeinsuchawaythatitisderived\nfrom the meaning of the comparative. To my knowledge this has not been pro-\nposed.\nInfixes\nInfixesinsertthemselvesinsidethestring. LookatthefollowingdatafromChrau\n(aVietnameselanguage).\n(363) v\u02c7oh \u2018know\u2019 van\u02c7oh \u2018wise\u2019\n(364) c\u02c7ah \u2018remember\u2019 can\u02c7ah \u2018leftover\u2019\nThe string /an/ is inserted after the first consonant!

We give an example from Egyptian\nArabic. Roots have three consonants, for example /ktb/ \u2018to write\u2019 and /drs/ \u2018to\nstudy\u2019. Words are formed by adding some material in front (prefixation), some 148 Lecture13: MorphologyII\nmaterial after (suffixation) and some material in between (infixation).

One thing\nhowever is already apparent: the vowels get changed from one form to the other.\nThisexplainswhythevowelisnotthoughtofasbeingpartoftheroot.\nOther Kinds of Changes\nReduplication is the phenomenon where a string is copied and added. For exam-\nple, if /abc/ is a string, then its (re)duplication is /abcabc/. Austronesian lan-\nguages like to use reduplication or sometimes even triplication for various pur-\nposes (to form the plural, to intensify a verb, to derive nouns and so on).

There exist huge differences across\nlanguages. Some languages pack all kinds of meanings into the verb (Inuit, Mo-\nhawk), some keep everything separate (Chinese). Most languages are somewhere\ninbetween. Morphologyismoreorlessimportant. However,evenwithinonelan-\nguage itself the means to express something change. Adjectives in English have\nthree forms: positive (normal form), comparative (form of simple comparison)\nand superlative (form of absolute comparison). Now look at the way they get\nformed.\npositive comparative superlative\nhigh higher highest\nfast faster fastest\n(370)\ncommon more common most common\ngood better best\nbad worse worst\nThe first set of adjectives take suffixes (zero for the positive, /er/ for the compar-\native and /est/ for the superlative). The second set of adjectives take a separate\nword, which is added in front (/more/ and /most/). The third set is irregular. The\nadjective/good/changestherootinthecomparativeandsuperlativebeforeadding\nthe suffix (/bett/ in the comparative and /b/ in the superlative), while /bad/ does\nnot allow an analysis into root and suffix in the comparative and superlative. (We\nmay define a suffix, but it will be a one-time-only suffix, since there is no other\nadjective like /bad/. It therefore makes not much sense to define a separate com-\nparativesuffixfor/worse/. However,/worst/isadebatablecase.) 150 Lecture13: MorphologyII\nIt is not far fetched to subsume the difference between PPs and case marked\nDPs under this heading. Finnish has a case to express movement into a location,\nandacaseformovementtoalocation:\n(371) Jussi menee taloon.\nJussigoeshouse-into=Jussigoesintothehouse.\n(372) Jussi menee talolle.\nJussigoeshouse-to=Jussigoestothehouse.\nWhen it comes to other concepts\u2014like \u2018under\u2019 and \u2018over\u2019\u2014Finnish runs out of\ncasesandstartstouseadpositions:\n(373) Jussi menee talon alle.\nJussigoeshouse-genunder=\u2018Jussigoesunderthehouse.\u2019\n(374) Jussi menee talon yli.\nJussigoeshouse-genover=\u2018Jussigoesoverthehouse.\u2019\nHungarian has a case for being on top of, but the situation is quite analogous to\nFinnish.\nThus, the cutoff point between morphology and syntax is arbitrary. However,\nthe two may show to behave differently in a given language so that the choice\nbetween morphological and syntactical means of expression has further conse-\nquences. We have seen, for example, that the comparative morpheme /er/ is a\nsuffix\u2014so it is added after the word. However, the comparative lexeme /more/\nwantstheadjectivetoitsright. Thelatterisattributabletothegeneralstructureof\nEnglish phrases. The complement is always to the right. Morphemes are exempt\nfrom this rule. They can be on the other side, and generally this is what happens.\nForexample,verb+nouncompoundsinEnglishareformedbyplacingtheverbaf-\nterthenoun: /goalkeeper/,/eggwarmer/,/lifesaver/andsoon.

It is unfortunate,\nhowever, that there is such an asymmetry. For from a syntactic perspective, there\nis not much of a difference between the two. It is for this reason\u2014and others\u2014\nthat one has sought to expand the scope of syntax downwards into morphology.\nLinguists one used to think of the form /thinks/ as a verb form with some fea-\ntures, thus a syntactically indecomposable whole. Nowadays, however, one sees\n/thinks/ as syntactically complex. This brings us back to Lecture 11, Page 131.\nThere we have already said that the reason for head movement was that the verb\nform /thinks/ is syntactically complex, but that its parts are distributed in the Lecture13: MorphologyII 153\nsentence in the wrong way. Given that the string /s/ wants to be added to the end\nofaverb,andthattheverbalrootcannotbepronouncedassuch,thesolutionisto\nmove the verb upwards, and form a complex head [ [ think][ s]]. Similarly, at\nC V C\nthe deep level all the surface complications of the Latin perfect disappear. There\nisasinglemorpheme,anditisaddedtothestem.\nThe analysis of words as complex heads has proved to be a very fruitful idea.\nWith verbs actually hosting quite a number of other morphemes (agreement (in\nperson, in number, in gender), voice (active or passive), aspect (completed or\nongoing activity), definiteness, to name a few), the scope of syntax expanded\nmassivelyattheexpenseofmorphology. Semantics I: Basic Remarks on Representation\nSemantics studies meanings. It is intimately connected with logic,\nthe study of reasoning. To see whether we have the correct meaning\nit is sometimes illuminating to check whether the purported meaning\ncarriesthecorrectlogicalconsequences.\nSo far we have been concerned only with the form of language expressions, and\nnot with their meaning. Ultimately, however, language is designed to allow us\nto communicate to each other how the world is like, to make each other do or\nbelieve something, and so on. The part of linguistics that deals mainly with the\nquestion of what is meant by saying something is called semantics. Meaning is\nnot just some aspect of the form in which expressions are put by the language.\nIf I tell you that Paul has pestered at least three squirrels this morning you can\nconclude that he has pestered at least two squirrels this morning. That follows\nnot by virtue of the form the words /three/ and /two/ have, but in virtue of what\nthese words mean. Likewise, if I get told that exactly half of my students do\nnot like syntax, and I have 180 students, then I conclude that 90 students do not\nlike syntax. This reasoning works independently of the language in which the\nsentencesarephrased. ThesameinformationcanbeconveyedinEnglish,French,\nSwahiliandsoon.

Thisdefinitiontalksaboutpropo-\nsitions, not about statements. However, we still need to use some language to\ndenote the statements that we want to talk about. Often enough linguists are con-\ntent in using the statements in place of the proposition that they denote. So we 156 Lecture14: SemanticsI\nwrite\n(388) Peter gets married.,Sue gets married.\n(cid:15) Peter and Sue get married.\nAlsothefollowingistrue\n(389) Peter marries Sue. (cid:15) Peter gets married.\nButthisoftenisanoversimplification. Itsoturnsoutthatsentencesdonotalways\nexpress just one proposition, they can express various propositions, sometimes\ndepending on the context. We say that they are ambiguous. Look again at the\nexample(385). Therearetwowaystounderstand\n(390) Peter and Sue get married.\nOne way is to understand it as them getting married to each other; another is to\nunderstand it expressing that Peter gets married to someone, and Sue does. Even\nthough the latter interpretation covers the first one, intuitively they are distinct.\nAnd it is in fact this stronger reading that is the preferred one. This explain that\nsomepeoplewouldactuallythinkthat(385)isinfactfalsesincethepremissesdo\nnot support the (stronger, but preferred) reading where Peter marries Sue. Thus,\njudgementsonlogicalconclusionaredifficulttoelicitinpresenceofambiguity.\nThere are other instances where one and the same sentence can have different\nmeanings without being called ambiguous. The easiest example is provided by\npronouns. SupposeIsay\n(391) I love Sachertorte.\nThen the proposition expressed by this sentence is different from the proposition\nexpressed by the same sentence uttered by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is so\nsince I can truly utter (391) at the same time when he can truly deny (391), and\nviceversa. Moreover,(391)utteredbymeisroughlyequivalentto\n(392) Marcus Kracht loves Sachertorte.\nThisofcoursewouldnotbesoifitwereanutterancebyArnoldSchwarzenegger,\ninwhichcasetheutteranceexpressedthesamepropositionas\n(393) Arnold Schwarzenegger loves Sachertorte. Lecture14: SemanticsI 157\nAnother case is the following. Often we use a seemingly weaker sentence to\nexpressastrongerone. Forexample,wesay\n(394) Peter and Sue got married.\nwhen we want to say that Peter married Sue. There is nothing wrong in doing\nso, as (394) is true on that occasion, too. But in fact what we intended to convey\nwas that Peter married Sue, and we expect our interlocutor to understand that.\nSemantics does not deal with the latter problem; it does not investigate what we\nactually intend to say by saying something. This is left to pragmatics. (Some\nwould also relegate the Sachertorte-example to pragmatics, but that view is not\nshared by everyone.) Still, even if such things are excluded, natural language\nmeaningsarenotalwaysclearbeyonddoubt. Let\u2019slookatthefollowingsentence.\n(395) John is a bright UCLA student.\nSupposeitisagreedthatinordertobeaUCLAstudentonehastobeparticularly\nbright in comparison to other students. Now, is (395) saying that John is bright\neven in comparison to other UCLA students, so that he is far brighter than aver-\nage? Or does it only say that John is bright as a student, and that in addition he is\naUCLAstudent? Thereisnounequivocalanswertothis.\nHereisanothercase.\n(396) Six companies sent three representatives to the\ntrade fare.\nHow many representatives got sent? Three or eighteen?

Rather, it is the way the world normally is that\nmakesuschooseoneinterpretationoveranother. Forexample,weexpectthatone 158 Lecture14: SemanticsI\nis employed by just one company. So, if a company sends out a representative,\nit is by default a representative only of this company and not of another. We can\nimagine things to be otherwise. If the companies strike a deal by which they all\npool together and send a three employees to represent them all, (396) would also\nbe true. However, our expectations are different, and this implies that we think\nthat (396) speaks about in total 18 representatives. In (397) on the other hand\nthere is no expectation about the sameness or difference of the universities that\nthe individual students visit. Each students visits six universities, but it is quite\npossiblethattheyvisitpartlyortotallythesameuniversities.\nThere are two ways of making clear what one wants to say. The first is to use\nasentencethatiscleareronthepoint. Forexample,thefollowingsentencesmake\nclearonthepointinquestionwhatismeant.\n(398) Six companies sent three representatives each to the\ntrade fare.\n(399) Six companies sent in total three representatives to\nthe trade fare.\nThe other option is to use a formal language that has well-defined meanings\nand into which propositions are rendered. It is the latter approach that is more\nwidespread, since the nuances in meaning are sometimes very difficult to express\nin natural language. Often enough, a mixture of the two are used. In the previ-\nous section we have used indices to make precise which DPs are taken to refer to\nthe same individual. We shall do the same here. For example, we shall use the\nfollowingnotation.\n(400) run0(x)\nHere, x is a variable which can be filled by an individual, say john0 and it will be\ntrueorfalse. So,\n(401) run0(john0)\nisaproposition,anditiseithertrueorfalse. Thislookslikeafunnywayofsaying\nthe same thing, but the frequent use of brackets and other symbols will actually\ndo the job of making meanings more precise. What it does not do, however, is\nexplain in detail what it means, for example, to run. It will not help in setting\nthe boundary between walking and running, even though semantics has a job to Lecture14: SemanticsI 159\ndo there as well. It is felt, though, that this part of the job falls into the lexicon\nandisthereforelefttolexicographers,whilesemanticsis(mostly)concernedwith\nexplaininghowthemeaningsofcomplexexpressionsaremadefromthemeanings\nofsimpleexpressions. Semantics II: Compositionality\nThethesisofcompositionalitysays,roughly,thatwhatisinthemean-\ning of a sentence is all in the meaning of its parts and the way they\nwereputtogether.\nTruth Values\nThe thesis of compositionality says that the meaning of a complex expression is\na function of the meaning of its parts and the way they have been put together.\nThus, in order to understand the meaning of a complex expression we should not\nneed to know how exactly it has been phrased as long as the two expressions\nare synonymous. In fact, we have made compositionality a design criterion of\nour representations. We said that when two constituents are merged together the\nmeaning of the complex expression is the result of applying a function to the\nmeaning of its parts. Rather than study this in its abstract form, we shall see how\nitworksinpractice.\nWe shall use the numbers 0 and 1 for saying whether or not a given sentence\nis true. The numbers 0 and 1 are therefore also called truth values (they are\nalso numbers, of course). 0 represents the \u2018false\u2019 and 1 represents the \u2018true\u2019. A\ngivensentenceiseitherfalseortrue,soitstruthvalueiseither0(whenitisfalse)\nor 1 (when it is true). We imagine that there is a ghost, or machine, or oracle\nwhich tells us for every possible statement whether or not it is true or false. In\nmathematical jargon we call this ghost a function. We represent this function by\na letter, say g. g needs a string and returns 1 or 0 instead of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Now,\ng must abide by the conventions of the language. For example, a sentence of the\nformS and T istrueifandonlyifbothS andT aretrue. So,\n(402) g(S and T) = 1ifandonlyifg(S) = 1andg(T) = 1\nThiscanberephrasedasfollows. Weintroduceasymbol\u2229,whichhasexactlythe\nfollowing meaning. It is an operation which needs two truth values and returns a\ntruthvalue. Itstableisthefollowing.\n\u2229 0 1\n(403) 0 0 0\n1 0 1 Lecture15: SemanticsII 161\nNowwecanwrite\n(404) g(S and T) = g(S)\u2229g(T)\nThis suggests that we take the meaning of /and/ to be exactly \u2229 so that one may\nwonder what it is I am saying here. Notice however that \u2229 is a formal symbol\nwhich has the meaning that we have given it; /and/ on the other hand is a word\nof English whose meaning we want to describe. Thus, to say that /and/ means\n\u2229 is actually to say something meaningful! In the same way we can say that the\nmeaningof/or/isthefollowingfunction\n\u222a 0 1\n(405) 0 0 1\n1 1 1\nandthatthemeaningof/if/\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7/then/isthefunction\n\u2192 0 1\n(406) 0 1 1\n1 0 1\nThis takes a while to understand. We claim that a sentence of the form /if S\nthen T/ is true if either S is false or T is true. Often, people understand such\na sentence as saying that S must be true exactly when T is true. But this is not\nso. (It is an error of fact, to be sure; I am not claiming the meaning of /if\u00b7then/\nought to be different from what it is. I am claiming that people do factually use\n/if\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7then/ in that way. However, it is known that the meaning of /if\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7then is\na complex affair.) For example, suppose I order a book at the bookstore and they\nsaytome\n(407) If the book arrives next week, we shall notify you.\nThenifthebookindeedarrivesandtheydonotnotifymetheyhaveissuedafalse\npromise. On the other hand, if it does not arrive and still they notify me (saying\nthat it hasn\u2019t arrived yet), that is still alright. To give another example: in math-\nematics there are lots of theorems which say: \u2018if the Riemann hypothesis is true\nthen...\u2019. ThepointisthatnobodyreallyknowsifRiemann\u2019shypothesisisactually\ntrue. (If you have a proof, you will be famous in no time!) But the theorems will\nremaintruenomatterwhichwaythehypothesisiseventuallydecided. Toseehow\nthisfollowsinoursetupnoticethatwehavesaidthat\n(408) g(if S then T) = g(S) \u2192 g(T) 162 Lecture15: SemanticsII\nThis means that if S then T is true if either S is false (that is, g(S) = 0) or\nT is true (that is g(T) = 1). Why it is that people consider a sentence of the\nform /if S then T/ to say the same as /S if and only if T/ still needs to\nbe explained. Part of the explanation is pragmatic. It comes from analysing two\nthings: the utterance situation, and the language system. The utterance situation\ndefinesinwhichwaywetalkandhowweactuallyuselanguage. Iftalking\u2018math-\nematics\u2019 the meaning of /if\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7then/ has a meaning that is fixed by convention\nin a way it is not in ordinary talk. Thus the example of Riemann conjecture was\nmisleading: it showed us not what /if\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7then/ ordinarily means, but rather what\nitmeansinmathematicaldiscourse.

This function is in a predicament with respect\nto(409),foritmaybethatitisbothtrueandfalse. Doesthismeanthatourpicture\nof compositionality is actually wrong? The short answer is: no! To understand\nwhy this is so, we need to actually look closer into the syntax and semantics of\n/and/. First, we have assumed that syntactically everything is binary branching.\nSothestructureof/Pete talks and John walks/is\n(414) [[Pete talks] [and [John walks] ]]\nCP CP CP\nThus, /and/ forms a constituent together with the right hand CP (the latter is also\ncalled conjunct).

Given\nan expression, it yields a function. For example, given the term x2 it gives the\nfunction \u03bbx.x2, which outputs the square of its input. In ordinary mathemantics\none writes this as y = x2, but this latter notation (which is intended to say exactly\nthesame)isactuallynotusefulforthepurposeathand. Toavoidtheshortcomings\nof this \u2018usual\u2019 notation, the \u03bb got introduced. In practice, if you know what the\nanswer is in each case, say it is x2, then \u03bbx.x2 is a function (or machine, oracle, 164 Lecture15: SemanticsII\nalgorithm,whateveryoufindmoreinstructive)thatgivesyoutheanswern2 when\nyougiveitthenumbern. Forexample,yougiveitthenumber3,itgivesyouback\n9; you give it 7, it answers 49. And so on. But why is \u03bbx.x2 different from x2?\nThe difference can be appreciated as follows. I can say: Let x2 < 16. Because\ndepending on what x is, x2 is smaller than 16 or it isn\u2019t. It is like saying Let\n\u22124 < x < 4.

So, it is\nknown to us directly. Everything else needs some computation on our side. A\nfunction of type \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 is asking for an object of type \u03b1 to be given. It will then\ncall an object of type \u03b2 for an answer. Typically we had \u03b1 = t. An object of type\nt \u2192 \u03b2 is waiting to be given a truth value and it will then return an object of type\n\u03b2.\nIstheremoretoitthanjusttruthvalues? Thereis! Weshallassume,forexam-\nple, that there is a type e that comprises all objects of the world. Every physical\nobject belongs to e, including people, animals, stars, and even ideas, objects of\nthe past like dinosaurs, objects of unknown existence like UFOs, they are all of\ntype e.

These functions are called (unary) predicates. Intransitive\npredicates denote unary predicates. For example, /run/, /talk/ and /walk/. We\nshall truly treat them as functions. We do not know how they work. This is part\nof the lexicon, or if you wish, this part of the knowledge of the language that we\nmust acquire what it means that someone talks, or walks, or runs. In the absence\nof anything better we write run0 for the function of type e \u2192 t that tells us if\nsomeone is running.

Semantics III: Basic Elements of Interpretation\nThe things that exist come in different forms. There are objects, time\npoints, events, truth values, and so on. These properties are funda-\nmental. A truth value can never be a number regardless of the fact\nthatweusenumbers(orletters)tostandinforthem.\nOn What There Is\nWithlanguagewecanseeminglytalkabouteverythingthatexists. Whilethiscan\n(at least abstractly) be shown to be impossible, the range of things that we can\ntalk about is immense. However, this vast expressive power creates its own chal-\nlenges. For to the human mind the things around us are of different nature. There\nare physical objects, people, places, times, properties, events and so on. Lan-\nguages reflect this categorisation of things in different ways. For example: many\nlanguagesclassifythingsintovariousgroups,calledgendersorclasses. Thisclas-\nsificationproceedsalongseverallines. Manylanguagesdistinguishanimatefrom\ninanimate,forexample. Andwithintheanimatebetweenpeopleandanimals,and\nwithin the people the male and the female, and so on. This division is in no way\nobjectively given. Why should we care to distinguish humans from animals, or\nanimals from stones? Clearly, the answer is that language is shaped to serve the\nneeds of humans, not dogs or stones. And further: language answers to the need\nofasocietyandculture.\nThedivisionofthingsintogendersorclassesisrealisedindifferentways. For\nsome languages it is part of the morphology (French, for example) for other it is\nirrelevant (Hungarian). One has made a lot out of that difference; the so-called\nSapir-Whorf-Thesis states that the language we speak has a profound influence\non the way we think. The reasoning is that if gender distinctions are obligatory\nthenweneedtopaymoreattentiontoitandconsequentlytakethistobeafeature\nworth attending to. Nowadays one tends to think that the influence of language\non perception has been much overstated. The fact that the Hopi language does\nnot distinguish past from furture does not mean they cannot tell the difference\nor are in any way less likely to understand it. Yet there seem to be areas where\nthe thesis has its merits, be it only in categorical perception of sounds. Another\nexamplespatiallanguage. Ithasbeenclaimedthattherearelanguageswherethere Lecture16: SemanticsIII 169\nare only absolute spatial prepositions of the type /north/, /south/, and that the\nspeakersoftheselanguagesarefarbetterattrackingabsolutedirections.\nTotheextentthattheclassificationofthingsisrelevanttolanguage,itisgoing\nto be reflected in the basic semantic types. We shall review a few basic types of\nthingsthatarerelevanttonaturallanguages.\nNumber: Individuals and Groups\nLookatthefollowingcontrast.\n(425) John and Mary met.\n(426) The senators met.\n(427) The committee met.\n(428) \u2217John met.\nEvidently, in order to meet you need to meet with somebody. But apparently\nseveral people can meet in the sense that they meet with each other. One way to\naccount for this difference is to say that the verb /meet/ needs a group of people\nas its subject. Since committees, lines and other things can also meet, it is not\nsimplyafactofgrammar,inotherwords,itcannotbedecidedbysyntacticmeans\nalone whether a sentence is well formed, witness the distinction between (427)\nand (428). So we say instead that /meet/ needs a group of things, without further\nqualification. There are basically two ways to form groups: you use the plural or\nyouuse/and/.\nThustherearebasicDPsthatdenoteindividuals,andthosethatdenotegroups.\nIt is however to be noted that singular DPs rarely denote groups directly; rather,\nthey denote some entity that is constituted (among other things) by its members\n(like a committee or a parliament). They therefore can be used as group denoting\nDPs only in a derived sense. The primary source of group denoting expression\nis something else. It is plural DPs and DPs coordinated with the help of /and/.\nGroups can evidently be subjects of verbs, and sometimes verbs specifically re-\nquiregroupsassubjects. Otherverbstakeboth.\n(429) Paul is eating.\n(430) Paul and the neighbouring cat are eating. 170 Lecture16: SemanticsIII\nIn the case of /eat/ we may think of it as being an activity that is basically per-\nformedbyeachindividualalone. Ifitisunderstoodtobethisway,theverbissaid\ntobedistributive. ItmeansinthepresentcasethatthefactthatPauliseatingand\nthat the neighbouring cat is eating is enough to make the sentence (430) true.

A and B V.\n(432) B Vs.\n\u2234 \u2234\nA Vs. B Vs.\n\u2234\nA and B V.\nNow, if there are groups of people, are there also groups of groups? There are!\nHere is an interesting pattern. You can get married as a group of two people\nby getting married to each other. This involves a one-time event that makes you\nmarriedtoeachother. Youcangetmarriedasagroupbyeachmarryingsomeone\nelse. Thesentence(433)canbereadinthesetwoways. Thereasonwhythisisso\nliesinthefactthat/get married/actuallyalsoisaverbthattakesindividuals.\n(433) John and Sue got married.\n(434) John got married.\nMoreover, the above test of distributivity goes through in that case. But if we\nunderstand it in the non-distributive sense, the inference does not go through, of\ncourse. Now,let\u2019sformagroupofgroups:\n(435) John and Alison and Bill and Sue got married.\nThereisareadingwhichsaysthatJohnmarriesAlison,andBillmarriesSue. This\nreading exists in virtue of the following. /John and Alison/ denotes a group,\nsodoes/Bill and Sue/. Theverbappliestosuchgroupsinthemeaning\u2018marry\neach other\u2019. By our understanding of marriage, if several groups get married to\neachother,thismeansthatallgroupsgetmarriedseparately.\nTherearealsoverbsthatencourageagroupofgroupsreading.\n(436) The ants were marching eight by eight.

This is not what can be concluded from\nthe premises. All that follows is that the senators met (with each other) and that\nthecongressmenmet(witheachother).\nTime\nProperties can change over time.

This\ntrichotomy translates into the three basic tenses of English. The present is used\nforsomethingthathappensnow,thepastisusedforsomethingthathashappened\nbeforenow,andthefutureisusedforsomethingthatwillhappenlater.\n(438) John runs. (present)\n(439) John ran. (past)\n(440) John will run. (future)\nWe make reference to time through various ways. One is the words /now/ and\n/yesterday/. /now/ refers to the very moment of time where it is uttered; textt-\ntyesterday/ refers to any time point that is on the day before today. Today on the\notherhandisthedayof\u2018now\u2019. Otherwordsrequiresomecalculation.\n(441) John realized on Monday that he had lost his wallet\nthe day before. 172 Lecture16: SemanticsIII\nWe do not know exactly when things happened. We know that John\u2019s realising\nhe had lost his wallet happened in the past (because we used past tense); and it\nhappened on a Monday. His losing the wallet happened just the day before that\nMonday, so it was on a Sunday. Suppose we replaced /the day before/ by\n/yesterday/:\n(442) John realized on Monday that he had lost his wallet\nyesterday.\nThen John\u2019s realizing is in the past, and it is on a Monday. His losing his wallet\nis prior to his realizing (we infer that among other from the phrase /had lost/\nwhich is a tense called pluperfect). And it was yesterday. So, today is Monday\nand yesterday John lost his wallet, and today he realizes that. Or he realized yes-\nterdaythatonthatdayhehadlosthiswallet. (Actually,thephrase/on Monday/is\ndispreferredhere. Wearenotlikelytosayexactlywhatdayoftheweekitiswhen\nit is today or yesterday or tomorrow. But that is not something that semantics\nconcerns itself with.

We grow up thinking spatially;\nhow to get furniture through a door, how to catch the neighbour\u2019s cat, how to not\nget hit by a car, all these things require coordination of actions and thinking in\ntime and space. This is the reason why language is filled with phrases that one\nway or another refer to space. The most evident expressions are /here/, which\nfunctions the same way as /now/, and /there/ (analogous to /then/). It denotes\nthe space that speaker is occupying at the moment of utterance. It is involved in\nthewords/come/and/go/. Ifsomeoneisapproachingmerightnow,Icansay\n(444) He is coming. Lecture16: SemanticsIII 173\nButIwouldnotsaythatheisgoing.

German uses verbal prefixes (/hin/ and /her/) for a lot of verbs to indicate\nwhethermovementisdirectedtowardsspeakerornot.\nSpace is not linear, it is organized differently, and language reflects that. Sup-\npose I want to say where a particular building is located on campus. Typically\nwe phrase this by giving an orientation and a distance (this is known as \u2018polar\ncoordinates\u2019). Forexample,\n(445) 200 m southwest of here\ngives an orientation (southwest) and a distance (200 metres). The orientation is\neither given in absolute terms, or it can be relative to the way one is positioned,\nfor example /to the right/. To understand the meaning of what I am saying\nwhenIsay/Go to the right!/youhavetoknowwhichwayIamfacing.\nWorlds and Situations\nWehavestartedoutbysayingthatsentencesareeithertrueorfalse. So,anygiven\nsentencesuchasthefollowingiseithertrueorfalse.\n(446) Paul is chasing a squirrel.\n(447) Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo.\n(448) Kitten are young cats.\nWe can imagine with respect (446) that it is true right now or that it is false. In\nfact,wedonotevenknow. With(447)itisthesame,althoughifwehavelearneda\nlittlehistory wewill knowthatit istrue.

There are worlds in which (446) is true and (447) is false,\nothersinwhich(446)isfalseand(447)istrue,othersinwhichbotharefalse,and\nagain others in which both are false. And there is one (and only one) world we\nlivein.\nSeemingly then, any combination of saying this and that sentence is true or\nfalseis aworld. Butthis isnot quitetrue. (448)is different. It istrue. Tosuppose\notherwise however would be tantamount to violating the rules of language. If I 174 Lecture16: SemanticsIII\nwere to say \u2018suppose that kittens are not young cats but in fact old rats ...\u2019 what\nI ask you is to change the way English is understood. I am not talking about a\ndifferent world. Worlds have an independent existence from the language that is\nbeing used. We say then that (448) is necessarily true, just like /4+7=11/. If you\ndonotbelieveeitherofthemyouarejustnotinthepicture.\nThe denotation of a word like /cat/ in this world is the set of all beings that\nare cats. They can change from world to world. We can imagine a world that has\nabsolutelynocats. (Ifwegobackintime,therewasatimewhenthiswasactually\ntrue.) Or one that has no mice. But we do not suppose that just because there\nare different sets of cats in different worlds the meaning of the word changes\u2014it\ndoesnot. That\u2019swhyyoucannotsupposethatkittensareoldrats. Wesaythatthe\nmeaningoftheword/cat/isafunctioncat0 thatforeachandeveryworldwgives\nsome set, cat0(w). We of course understand that cat0(w) is the set of all cats in w.\n(Some people use the word intension for that function.) Likewise, the intension\nof the word /rat/ gives for each world w the set of all rats in w, and likewise for\ntheword/kitten/. ItisafactofEnglishthat\n(449) kitten0(w) \u2286 cat0(w), kitten0(w)\u2229rat0(w) = \u2205\nThere are plenty of words that are sensitive not just to the denotation but to the\nmeaning.\n(450) John doubts that Homer has lived.\n(451) Robin thinks that Napoleon actually won Waterloo.\nNobody actually knows whether or not Homer has existed. Still we think that the\nsentence\u2018Homerhaslived.\u2019 hasadefiniteanswer(someghostshouldtellus...). It\nis either true or not. Independently of the answer, we can hold beliefs that settle\nthe question one way or the other, regardless of whether the sentence is factually\ntrue or not. Robin, for example, might be informed about the meaning of all\nEnglishwords,andyetisalittleweakonhistory. SosheholdsthatNapoleonwon\nWaterloo. John might believe the opposite, and Robin might believe that Homer\nhas lived. Different people, different opinions. But to disagree on the fact that\nkittensarecatsandnotratsmeansnotusingEnglishanymore. Lecture16: SemanticsIII 175\nEvents\nWhen I sit behind the computer typing on the keyboard, this is an activity. You\ncanwatchmedoitanddescribetheactivityinvariousways. Youcansay\n(452) He is typing on the keyboard.\n(453) He is fixing the computer.\n(454) He is writing a new book.\nBoth (452) and (453) can be manifested by the same physical activity: me sitting\nbehind the computer and typing something in. Whether or not I am fixing the\ncomputer by doing so, time will tell. But in principle I could be fixing the com-\nputerjustbytypingonthekeyboard. Thesamegoesforwritingabook. Thus,one\nand the same physical activity can be a manifestation of various different things.\nIn order to capture this insight, one has proposed that verbs denote particular ob-\njects called events. There are events of typing, as there are events of fixing the\ncomputer, and events of writing a book. Events are distinct from the processes\nthatmanifestthem.\nEvents will figure in Lecture 18, so we shall not go into much detail here.\nThere are a few things worth knowing about events. First, there are two kinds of\nevents: statesandprocesses. Astateisaneventwherenothingchanges.\n(455) Lisa knows Spanish.\n(456) Harry is 8 feet tall.\nTheseareexampleswherethetruthofsomethingisassertedatamomentoftime,\nbut there is no indication that something changes. By contrast the following sen-\ntencestalkaboutprocesses.\n(457) Paul is running.\n(458) The administrator is filling out the form.\n(459) The artist is making a sculpture.\nIn the first example, Paul is changing place or posture. In the second the admin-\nistrator is for example writing on some piece of paper which changes that very\npiece of paper. In the third example a statue comes into existence from some\nlump of material. Events have participants whose number and contribution can 176 Lecture16: SemanticsIII\nvary greatly. A process always involves someone or something that undergoes\nchange. This is called the theme. In (457) the theme is Paul, in (458) the theme\nis the form, in (459) the theme is the sculpture. Events usually have a participant\nthat makes the change happen; in (457) the actor is again Paul, in (458) it is the\nadministrator,in(459)itistheartist. Thereneednotbeanactor,justasthereneed\nnot be a theme; but mostly there is a theme. Some events have what is called an\nexperiencer. Inthenextsentence,Jeremyistheexperiencerofhate.\n(460) Jeremy hates football.\nNotice that experiencer predicates express states of emotion, so they fall into the\ncategory of verbs that express states rather than processes. Another class of par-\nticipants are the beneficiaries; these are the ones for whose benefit an action is\nperformed,likethewifeoftheviolinistinthefollowingexample.\n(461) The violinist composed a sonata for his wife.\nThelistofparticipanttypesislonger,buttheseonesarethemostcommonones.\nProcesses are sometimes meant to finish in some state and sometimes not. If\nyou are said to be running no indication is made as to when you will stop doing\nso. Ifyouaresaidtoberunningamilethenthereisaninherentpointthatdefines\ntheendoftheactivityyouengagein. Someverbsdenotethelatterkindofevents:\n/arrive/, /reach/, /pop/, /finish/. The process they denote is finished when\nsomethingspecifichappens.\n(462) Mary arrived in London.\n(463) The composer finished the oratorio.\nIn (462) the arriving of Mary happens at a more or less clearly defined time span,\nsaywhenthetraingetsclosetothestationuptowhenitcomestoahalt. Similarly\nfor(463),wherethefinishingisthelaststretchoftheeventofwritingtheoratorio.\nThe latter is a preparatory action. So, you can write an oratorio for a long time,\nmaybe years, but you can only finish it in a considerably shorter time, at the end\nofyourwritingit.\nNotes on this section. There are most likely to be a few more sorts, for exam-\nple, degrees. Notice that there is a big difference between the classification here\nand what is nowadays in computer science called an ontology, which is a rather\nrichclassificationofthings. Semantics IV: Scope\nDifferent analyses of sentences give rise to different c-command re-\nlations between constituents. These in turn determine different inter-\npretations of sentences. Thus one of the reasons why sentences can\nmeandifferentthingsisthattheycanhavedifferentstructures.\nLetusreturntoexample(409),repeatedhereas(464).\n(464) Pete talks and John talks or John walks.\nWe have said that under certain circumstances it may turn out to be both true\nand false, depending on how we read it. These interpretations are also called\nreadings. In this lecture we shall be interested in understanding how different\nreadingsmayalsobestructurallydifferent. (Structuraldifferencesarenottheonly\nreason for different interpretations.) The syntactic notion that is pivotal here is\nthat of scope. We shall say that every constituent has a scope; the scope is that\nstringpart(constituent)thatservesasasemanticargumenttoit. Thisdefinitionis\nsemantic by intention. However, we can also give syntactic correspondences for\nthe scope and thereby eliminate reference to semantics. For example, for a head\nthe scope is exactly its complement. We shall fill this definition with life right\naway. In (464) we find two logical connectives, /and/ and /or/. Each of them\ntakes two CPs, one to the right and one to the left. This is all the requirements\nthey make on the syntactic side. This means that syntactically the sentence can\nbe given two different structures. They are shown in Figure 10. The structure of\nthe individual CPs is not shown, to save space. Let us look at (a). We can tell\nfromitsstructurewhatitsmeaningis. Weshallworkitoutstartingatthebottom.\nThe complement of /or/ is the CP /John walks/. So, /or John walks/ is a\nconstituent formed from /or/ and /John walks/.

We assume that each node has exactly two daughters.\nSupposewehaveastructure\n(472) \u03b3 = [\u03b1\u03b2]\nWe assume that the semantics is arranged in such a way that if two constituents\nare merged into one, the interpretation of one of the nodes is a function that can\nbe applied to the meaning of its sister. The first node is then called the semantic\nhead.

Noticethat/we have/alsoisarelativeclause,thoughitissomewhatshort-\nened(wecouldreplaceit/which we have/).\nSuppose you go to a car dealer and he utters (474). Then he is basically say-\ning that he has only one car. Moreover, this car has been under repair recently.\nSuppose however he says (475). Then he is only claiming that there is a single\ncarthathasbeenunderrepairrecently,whilehemaystillhavetonsofothers. Itis\nclear from which dealer you want to buy. To visualize the difference, we indicate\nthescopeoftheoperator/the only/:\n(476) This is the only [car we have],which has recently been\nrepaired.\n(477) This is the only [car we have which has recently been\nrepaired].\nIn the first sentence, /the only/ takes scope over /car we have/. It has scope\nover/car we have which has recently been repaired/inthesecondsen-\ntence. Itisnotnecessarytoformalizethesemanticsof/the only/. Weneedonly\nsay that something is the only P, if and only if (a) it is a P, and (b) nothing else\nis a P. So, if /the only/ takes scope only over /car we have/, then the car we\nare talking about is a car the dealer has (by (a)), and there is no other that he\nhas (by (b)). So he has only one car. If the scope is /car we have which has\nrecently been repaired/,thenthecarwearetalkingabouthasrecentlybeen\nrepaired (by (a)), it is one of the dealer\u2019s cars (also by (a)), and there is no other\ncarlikethat. So,theremaybeothercarsthatthedealerhasbuttheyhavenotbeen\nrepaired, and there may be other cars that were not the dealer\u2019s but have been\nrepaired.\nThe difference in structure between the two is signaled by the comma. If the\ncomma is added, the scope of /the only/ ends there. The relative clause is then\nsaid to be non-restrictive; if the comma is not there, the relative clause is said to\nbe restrictive. If we look at X-syntax again we see that non-restrictive relative\nclausesmustbeatleastD0-adjuncts,becausetheycannotbeinthescopeof/the/.\nIn fact, one can see that they are DP-adjuncts. Let us see how this goes. First we\nnoticethat/the/canbereplacedbyapossessivephrase(whichisinthegenitive):\n(478) Simon\u2019s favourite bedtime story\n(479) Paul\u2019s three recent attacks on squirrels 182 Lecture17: SemanticsIV\nThe possessives are phrases, so they are in specifier of DP, quite unlike the de-\nterminer /the/ itself. Notice that even though the possessive and the determiner\ncannot co-occur in English this is not due to the fact that they compete for the\nsameposition. InHungariantheycanco-occur:\n(480) Mari-nak a cip\u0151je\nMary-\uf764\uf761\uf774theshoe-\uf770\uf76f\uf773\uf7733\uf773\uf767\nMary\u2019sshoe\nLiterally translated, this means Mary\u2019s the her shoe. The possessive /Marinak/\n(in the dative!) occurs before the actual determiner. Now, the actual structure we\nare proposing is this (notice that the \u2019s is analysed as the D-head; there are other\npossibilities,forexampletakingittobeacasemarker(whichIprefer)):\n(481) [ DP[ DPPaul][ D0[ D\u2019s][ NPthree recent attacks on squirrels]]]\nNow,takeaDPwhichhasnon-restrictiverelativeclause.\n(482) Simon\u2019s only bedtime story, which he listens to care-\nfully\n(483) Paul\u2019s only attacks on squirrels, which were success-\nful\nThese DPs are perfect, but here we have /Simon\u2019s only/ and /Paul\u2019s only/.\nWe shall not go into the details of that construction and how it differs from /the\nonly/. In the first DP, /Simon\u2019s only/ takes /bedtime story/ in its scope. It\ncan only do so if the relative clause is an adjunct to DP. I remark here that I\nhave not given an analysis of the construction / A\u2019s only B/ just of /the only\nB/, though this can easily be done. Moreover, there are some problems in mak-\ning the string /the only/ and /Simon\u2019s only/ a constituent, so as to make the\nabove semantic interpretation mechanism work. Inasfar as the string /the only/\nis concerned we can make /only/ an adjective, thus forming part of the NP.\n/the only/ is then no longer a constituent. For possessors, we should then\nfirst make them possessors of the NP: /Paul recent attack on squirrels/,\nmake /only/ take this into its scope, and then finally add the head /\u2019s/. How to\nreconcilethiswiththesurfacesyntaxisamootpoint. (Itcostsussomemovement\nsteps.

It is\nclearthattheycanbeneitheradjunctstoDPnoradjunctstoD0 (becausethen/the\nonly/ cannot take scope over them). The restrictive relative clauses is therefore\nadjuncttoeitherN0 orNP.Weshallnotgointomoredetail.\nSo far we have seen that differences in interpretation manifest themselves in\ndifferencesinstructure. Thenextexampleisnotofthesamekind\u2014atleastatfirst\nsight. This example has to do with quantification. Suppose that the professors\ncomplainaboutofficespaceandtheadministratorsays\n(484) Every professor has an office.\nHemightbeutteringatruesentenceevenifthereisasingleofficethatisassigned\nto all professors. If this is to be understood as a remark about how generous the\nuniversityis,thenitisprobablyjustshortfor\n(485) Every professor has his own office.\nin which case it would be clear that each professor has a different office. The first\nreadingissemanticallystrongerthanthesecond. Forthereisasingleofficeandit\nis assigned to every professor then every professor has an office, albeit the same\none. However, if every professor has an office, different or not, it need not be\nthe same that there is just a single office. We can use \u2018stilted talk\u2019 to make the\ndifferencevisual:\n(486) There is an office such that it is assigned to every\nprofessor.\n(487) Every professor is such that an office is assigned to\nhim.\nIn the first sentence, /there is an office/ takes scope over /every profes-\nsor/. Inthesecondsentence/every professor/takesscopeover/an office/.\nReturning to the original sentence (485), however, we have difficulties as-\nsigning different scope relations to the quantifiers: clearly, syntactically /every\nprofessor/ takes /his own office/ in its scope. This problem has occupied 184 Lecture17: SemanticsIV\nsyntacticiansforalongtime.

Under one interpretation\nitmeansthatthereissomethingthatJohnsearchesfor,andhethinksitistheholy\ngrale. Under another interpretation it means that John is looking for something\nthat is the holy grale, but it may not even exist. This particular case is interesting\nbecausepeoplearedividedovertheissuewhetherornottheholygraleexisted(or\nexists, for that matter). Additionally, it is not clear what it actually was. So, we\nmightfinditandnotknowthatwehavefoundit. Wemayparaphrasethereadings\nasfollows.\n(489) There is the holy grale and John searches for it as\nthat.\n(490) There is something and John searches for it as the\nholy grale.\n(491) John is searching for something as the holy grale.\nHere, the meaning difference is brought out as a syntactic scope difference. The\nfirst is the strongest sentence: it implies that both speaker and John identify some\nobject as the holy grale. The second is somewhat weaker: according to it, there\nis something of which only John believes that it is the holy grale. The third is the\nweakest: Johnbelievesthatthereissuchathingastheholygrale,butitmightnot\neven exist. Such differences in meaning are quite real. There are people who do\nin fact search for the holy grale. Some of them see in it the same magical object\nas which it is described in the epics, while others do not think the object has or\never had the powers associated to it. Rather, for them the importance is that the\nknights of King Arthur\u2019s court possessed or tried to possess it. So they interpret\nthe medieval stories as myths that nevertheless tell us about something real (as\nSchliemann believed that Homer\u2019s Iliad may not have been about the Greeks and\ntheir gods, but at least about the fall of a real city, one that he later found). If\nthe first sentence is true then speaker and John agree in the identity of the holy Lecture17: SemanticsIV 185\ngrale;iftheydonotagree,theneitherofthemmustthinkoftheotherthattheyare\nmistaken about the identity of the holy grale. In the second sentence the speaker\nconcedesthatJohnisatleastconcernedaboutthepropertiesofanexistingobject,\nsaysomebowlordish,towhichJohnhoweverattributessomemysticalpower.\nNow, whether or not these differences can be related back to differences in\nstructures corresponding to (488) remains to be seen. Such a claim is difficult to\nsubstantiate. Semantics V: Cross-Categorial Parallelism\nThereisanimportantdistinctioninthestudyofnoundenotationsbe-\ntweencountnounsandmassnouns. Anequallyimportantdistinction\nisbetweenprocessesandaccomplishments/achievements. Itispossi-\nble to show that the division inside the class of nouns and inside the\nclassofverbsisquitesimilar.\nWe have said that nouns denote objects and that verbs denote events. It has been\nobserved, however, that some categorisations that have been made in the domain\nofobjectscarryovertoeventsandviceversa. Theyultimatelyrelatetoanunderly-\ningstructurethatissimilarinbothofthem. Aparticularinstanceisthedistinction\nbetween mass and count nouns. A noun is said to be a count noun if what it\nrefers to in the singular is a single object that cannot be conceived of consisting\nof parts that are also objects denoted by this noun; for example, \u2018bus\u2019 is a count\nnoun. In the singular it denotes a thing that cannot be conceived as consisting of\ntwoormorebusses. Ithasparts,forsure,suchasamotor,severalseats,windows\nand so on. But there is no part of it which is again a bus. We say that the bus is\nan integrated whole with respect to being a bus. Even though some parts of it\nmaynotbeneededforittobeabus,theydonotbythemselvesconstituteanother\nbus. Ultimately, the notion of integrated whole is a way of looking at things: a\nsingletrain,forexample,mayconsistoftwoenginesinfrontofseveraldozensof\nwagons. It may be that it has even been obtained by fusing together two trains.\nHowever, that train is not seen as two trains: it is seen as an integrated hole. That\nis why things are not as clear cut as we might like them to be. Although we are\nmostly in agreement as to whether a particular object is a train or not, or whether\nitistwotrains,anabstractdefinitionofanintegratedholeishardtogive.\nThe treatment of count nouns in formal semantics has therefore been this. A\nnoun denotes a certain set of things, the integrated wholes of the kind. The word\n/mouse/ denotes, for example, the set of all mice in this world; call that set M. A\nparticular object is a mouse if and only if it is in M. Groups of mice are subsets\nof M. Therefore, the plural /mice/ denotes the set of all subsets of M. (Or maybe\njust the subsets that contain more that one element, but that is not of essence\nhere.) Let us then say this: / A is a B/ is true if what / A/ denotes is an element of\nthe denotation of / B/. Then /Paul is a mouse./ is true if and only if Paul is a\nmember of M, that is, if Paul is a mouse. We shall say the same about / A are B/:\nitistrueifandonlyifwhat/ A/denotesisin/ B/. Exceptthattheagreementonthe Lecture18: SemanticsV 187\nverbhastomatchthatof/ A/(whichisnotasemanticfact). Therefore/Paul and\nDoug are mice./ is true if and only if the denotation of /Paul and Doug/ is in\nthe set of all subsets of M, that is, if it is a subset of M. The denotation of /Paul\nand Doug/ is among other things the set consisting of Paul and Doug. This is a\nsubsetof M exactlyifbothPaulandDougaremice.\nLet us return to the issue of dividing objects of a kind. It seems clear that\nthe division into smaller and smaller units must stop. A train cannot consist of\nsmaller and smaller trains. At some point, in fact very soon, it stops to be a train.\nThere is a difference with water. Although in science we learn that things are\notherwise, in actual practice water is divisible to any degree we like. And this is\nhow we conceive of it. We take an arbitrary quantity of water and divide it as we\nplease\u2014the parts are still water. Thus, /water/ is not a count noun; it is a mass\nnoun.\nOneproblemremains,though. Wehavenottalkedaboutmassthings,wehave\nconsistentlytalkedaboutmassorcountnouns. Wesaid,forexample,that/water/\nisamassnoun,notthatthesubstancewateritselfisamasssubstance. Inthiscase,\nit is easy to confuse the two. But there are occasions where the two are different.\nThe word /furniture/ turns out to be a mass noun, even though what it denotes\nclearly cannot be indefinitely divided into parts that are also called furniture. But\nhow do we know that something is a mass noun if we cannot ultimately rely on\nour intuitions about the world? There are a number of tests that establish this.\nFirst, mass nouns do not occur in the plural. We do not find \u2217/furnitures/ or\n\u2217/courages/. On the surface, /waters/ seems to be an exception. However, the\ndenotation of /waters/ is not the same as that of a plural of a count noun, which\nis a group. Waters is used, for example, with respect to clearly defined patches of\nwater(likeriversorlakes). Abettertestisthisone. Massnounsfreelyoccurwith\nso-calledclassifiers,whilecountnounsdonot.\n(492) a glass of water\n(493) a piece of furniture\n(494) a \u2217glass/\u2217piece of bus\nNoticethatonedoesnotsay\u2217/a glass of furniture/,nora\u2217/piece of wa-\nter/. Thekindofclassifierthatgoeswithamassnoundependsonwhatitactually\ndenotes. Some can be used across the board, like /lot/. Notice that classifiers\nmust be used without the indefinite determiner. So, with respect to (494), we can\nsay/a piece of a bus/butthen/piece/isnolongeraclassifier. 188 Lecture18: SemanticsV\nThere is an obvious distinction between whether or not objects of a kind are\ndivisible into objects of the same kind, and whether a language calls the noun\ndenoting this kind a mass noun. These must be kept separate. To a certain degree\nlanguages exercise their freedom of seeing the world in a different light. Some\nnouns are mass nouns when comes to using the tests, but everybody knows the\nkind they denote is not divisible; an example is /furniture/. A someone less\nclear case is /hair/. Notice furthermore that whether or not things of a kind can\nbe divided into things of the same kind depends on what you believe the world to\nbe like. This is clearest when we look at /water/. The scientific world view that\ntheprocessofdivisionmustcometoahalt. Eventuallywehaveasinglemolecule\nof water, and here the division must stop. Yet, our own experience is different.\nAs humans we experience water as arbitrarily divisible. The language we speak\nhas been formed not with scientific world view in mind; there is no authority\nthat declares that from now on /water/ must cease to be used as a mass noun.\nAnyhow, we see that there are example where even the naive experience tells us\ndifferently. It is the same as gender distinctions: for some languages they are not\nmorphologically relevant, but the division into various sexes, or other classes can\nusuallyberepresentedonewayoranother.\nLet us now look at verbs. Verbs denote events, as we have said. Events are\nlike films. We may picture them as a sequence of scenes, lined up like birds on\na telefone cable. For example, scene 1 may have Paul 10 feet away from some\nsquirrel; scene 2 sees Paul being 8 feet away from the squirrel; scene 3 sees Paul\njust 6 feet away from the squirrel; and so on, until he is finally right next to it,\nready to eat it. Assume that the squirrel is not moving at all. This sequence can\nthenbesummarizedbysaying:\n(495) Paul is attacking the squirrel.\nSimilarly,inscene1someoneisbehindablankpaper.

Lecture18: SemanticsV 189\nAllthesearelegitimatewaysofdescribingwhatisorwasgoingon. Unfortunately,\nthe director has decided to cut a few of the scenes at the end. So we now have a\ndifferent film. Now we are not in a position to truthfully utter (496) on the basis\nof the film any more. This is because even though what that person began to\ndrawlookslikethebeginningofacircle,thatcirclemayactuallyneverhavebeen\ncompleted. Notice that the situation is quite like the one where we stop watching\nthe movie: we are witnessing part of the story and guess what the rest is like,\nbut the circle may not get completed. However, (497) and (498) are still fine no\nmatter what really happens. Even if the director cuts parts of the beginning, still\n(497)and(498)arefine. Nomatterhowshortthefilmisandnomatterwhatreally\nhappenthereafter: thedescriptionisadequate.\nThis is the same situation as before with the nouns. Certain descriptions can\nbe applied also to subparts of the film, others cannot. Those events that can be\ndivided are called atelic; the others being telic. This is the accepted view. One\nshould note though that by definition, a telic event is one that ends in a certain\nstate, without which the event would not be the same. In other words: if we cut\nout parts of the beginning, that would not hurt. But if we could out parts of the\nend,thatwouldmakeadifference. Anexampleisthefollowing.\n(499) John went to the station.\nHere,itdoesnotmattersomuchwhereJohnstartsoutfrom,aslongitwassome-\nwhereawayfromthestation.

Adifferentoneis\n(500) John wrote a novel.\nHere, cutting out parts of the film anywhere will result in making (500) false,\nbecauseJohndidnotwritethenovelinitsentirety.\nNow, how do we test for divisibility (= atelicity)?

However, let\nus see if we can make the parallel even closer. We have said that mass terms are\ndivisible. Butsupposealsothis: ifyoupouralittlewaterintoyourglass,andthen\nagain a little bit, as a result you still have water. You cannot say you have two\nwater(s). You can only say this if, say, you have two glasses of water, so the bits\nofwaterareseparated. (Actually,withwaterthisstillsoundsodd,butwaterinthe\nsenseofriversallowthisuse.) Also,itdoesnotmakesensetodivideyourportion\nof water in any way and say that you have two pieces of water in your glasses.\nLikewise, suppose that John is running from 1 to 2pm and from 2pm to 3pm and\ndid not at all stop\u2014we would not say that he ran twice. The process of running\nstretchesalongthelongestintervaloftimeasitpossiblycan. Thereisoneprocess\nonly, just as there is water in your glass, without any boundary. The glass defines\nthe boundary of water; so if you put another glass of water next to it, there are\nnow two glasses of water. And if John is running from 1 to 2pm and then from\n3 to 4pm, he ran twice; there are now two processes of running, because he did\nstopinbetween.

We said that there is one oper-\nation, called \u2018merge\u2019 and that it operates on all of these four levels at the same\ntime. However, we had to make concessions to the way we construe the levels\nthemselves. For example, we argued that the English past tense marker was [d],\nbut that it gets modified in a predictable way to [t] or [@d]. Thus we were led to\nposit two levels: deep phonological and surface phonological level. Likewise we\nhave posited a deep syntactic level and a surface level (after movement has taken\nplace), and there is also a deep morphological level and a surface morphological\nlevel. This throws us into a dilemma: we can apply the morphological rules only\nafter we have the surface syntactical representation, because the latter reorders\nthelexicalelements. Likewise,thedeepphonologicalrepresentationbecomesap-\nparent only after we have computed the surface morphological form. Thus, the\nparallel model gives way to a sequential model, which has been advocated for by\nIgor Mel\u2019c\u02c7uk (in his Meaning-to-Text theory). In this model, the levels are not\nparallel, they are ordered sequentially. We speak by organising first the semantic\nrepresentation, then the words on the basis of that representation and the syntac-\ntic rules, then the morphological representation on the basis of the lexical, and\nthe phonological on the basis of the morphological representation.

Itruns\nby itself, but it interfaces with the phonology and the meaning at certain points.\nThe transformations are not taken to be operations that are actually executed, but\nare ways to organize syntactic (and linguistic) knowledge. This makes the empir-\nical assessment of this theory very difficult, because it is difficult to say what sort\nofevidenceisevidencefororagainstthismodel.\nThere are also other models of syntax. These try to eliminate the distinction\nbetween deep and surface structure.

Itisputintosentenceinitialpositionrightaway.\nOthergrammarsinsistonspecialalignmentrules.\nThere are probably as many theories as there are linguists. But even though\nthe discussion surrounding the architecture of linguistics has been much in fash-\nion in the last decades, some problems still remain that do not square with most\ntheories. We mention just one very irritating fact. We have seen that Malay uses\nreduplication for the plural. If that is so then first of all the plural sign has no\nsubstance: there is no actual string that signals the plural (like the English /s/).\nWhatsignalsthepluralisthereduplication. Thisisafunction\u03c1thatsendsastring\nx intothatstringconcatenatedwithitselfinthefollowingway:\n(513) \u03c1(x) := xa-a x\nThus, \u03c1(kerani) = kerani-kerani. This function does not care whether the\ninput string is an actual word of Malay. It could be anything. But it is this func-\ntion which is the phonology of the plural sign. This means among other that the\nphonologicalrepresentationofsignsmustbeverycomplicatedifthestoryofpar-\nallelism is to be upheld (recall the plural of /mouse/ with a floating segment). We\nhave to postulate signs whose phonology is not a string but a function on strings.\nUnfortunately, no other theory can do better here if that is what Malay is like.\nThus, the door has to be opened: there is more to the operation of merge than\nconcatenating strings. If that is so, we can try the same for syntax; there is more\nto syntax than concatenating constituents. It has been claimed that Chinese has a\nconstruction that duplicates entire constituents. Even if that story is not exactly\ntrue,thenewsisirritating. Itmeansthatentireconstituentsaretherejusttoconvey\nasinglepieceofmeaning(here: thatthesentenceisaquestion).\nBut we need not go that far. Lots of languages in Europe have agreement of\nonesortoranother. Englishstillhasnumberagreement,forexample,betweenthe\ndemonstrative and the NP (/this flag/ versus /these flags/), and with the\nverb. The agreement is completely formal. One says /these troops/ and not\n/this troops/, even though one does say /this army/. However, the number\nthat the demonstrative carries is semantically dependent on the noun: if the lat-\nter carries plural meaning, then the whole is plural, otherwise not. The semantic\ncontributionof\u2018these\u2019isnotpluralirrespectiveofwhetherthenounactuallyspec-\nifies plural meaning. Take \u2018guts\u2019, whose meaning may be singular like \u2018courage\u2019. Lecture18: SemanticsV 193\nUnfortunately, it cannot really be combined with a demonstrative. (Otherwise we\nwould expect /those guts/, and certainly not /that guts/.) A better example\nis Latin /litterae/ \u2018letter\u2019 (which you write to a friend), a morphological plural\nderived from /littera/ \u2018the letter\u2019 in the sense of \u2018the letter A\u2019. The letter you\nwriteisasingleobject,thoughitiscomposedfrommanyalphabeticletters. Itcon-\ntrols plural agreement in any event. Now, if the plural morpheme appears many\ntimes in the sentence, but only once is it allowed to carry plural meaning\u2014what\nare we to do with the rest of them? The puzzle has been noted occasionally, and\nagain several solutions have been tried. Harris speaks of a \u2018scattered morpheme\u2019,\nhe thought they are just one element, distributed (\u2018scattered\u2019) over many places.\nThe same intuition seems to drive generative grammar, but the semantics is never\nclearlyspelledout. Language Families and History of Languages\nItiscleareventoanuntrainedpersonthatcertainlanguages,sayItal-\nian and Spanish, must somehow be related.

The\nstudy of the history of language tries to answer (at least in part) one\nofthedeepestquestionsofmankind: wheredowecomefrom?\nToday, linguistics focuses on the mental state of speakers and how they come to\nlearn language. To large parts, the investigation dismisses input that comes from\nan area of linguistics that was once dominant: historical linguistics. The latter is\nthestudyofthehistoryanddevelopmentoflanguages.

It turns out that the correspondences are to a large\ndegree systematic. It can be observed that for example word initial [p] in Dutch\nand English corresponds to German [pf], that initial [s] becomes [S] before [t]\nand [p]. And so on. This has lead to two things: the postulation of a language\n(of which we have no record!), called Germanic, a set of words together with\nmorphology and syntax for this language, and a set of rules which show how the\nlanguage developed into its daughter languages. In the present case, the fact that\nDutch[p] correspondsto German[pf]is explainedbythe factthat Germanic(not\nto be confused with German) had a sound \u2217p (the star indicates reconstruction,\nnot that the sound is illegitimate).

It was proposed that all these languages (and their daughters, of course)\ndescend form a single language called Indo-European.

These\nare predicted by internal reconstruction to reflect an earlier state of the language\nwherepluralwasformedbyadditionof/en/andvowelchange,andthattheplural\n/s/ was a later development. This seems to be the case. Likewise, this method 198 Lecture19: LanguageFamiliesandHistoryofLanguages\npredicts that the comparative in English was once formed using /er/ and /est/,\nbut at some point got replaced by forms involving /more/ and /most/. In both\ncases, German reflects the earlier stage of English. Notice that the reasoning is\napplied to English as it presents itself to us now. The change is projected from\npresentdayEnglish. Buthowcanweascertainthatweareright?\nFirst and foremost, there are written documents. We have translations of the\nbible into numerous languages (including medieval Georgian (a Caucasian lan-\nguage)), and we have an Old English bible (King Alfred\u2019s bible), and a Gothic\nbible, for example. Latin and Greek literature has been preserved to this day\nthankstotheeffortofthousandsofmonksinthemonasteries(copyingwasavery\nhonorable and time consuming task in those days). Also other languages have\nbeen preserved, among which Avestan, Sanskrit and Hittite (written mostly in\ncuneiform). The other languages got written down from the early middle ages\nonwards, mostly in the form of biblical texts and legal documents. Now, this pro-\nvides us with the written language, but it does not tell us how they were spoken.\nIn the case of Hittite the problem is very obvious: the writing system was totally\ndifferentfromoursandithadtobediscoveredhowitwastoberead. ForSanskrit\nwe know from the writings of the linguists of those days, among which Pan.ini\n(500 BC) is probably one of the latest, how the language was spoken. This is be-\ncause we have explicit descriptions from them of how the sounds were produced.\nFor Latin and Greek matters are less easy. The Greeks, for example, did not real-\nizethedistinctionbetweenvoicedandvoicelessconsonants(theyknewtheywere\ndifferent but couldn\u2019t say what the difference was). In the middle ages all learned\npeople spoke Latin, but the Latin they spoke was very different from classical\nLatin, both in vocabulary and pronunciation. By that time, people did not know\nhow things were pronounced in the classical times (= first century BC). So how\ncomeweknow?\nOneansweris: forexamplethroughmistakespeoplemakewhenwritingLatin.\nInscriptions in Pompeii and other sites give telling examples. One specific exam-\nple is thefact that /m/after vowels waseither completely lost or justnasalized the\npreceding vowel. One infers this from the fact that there are inscriptions where\nonefinds/ponte/inplaceofwhatshouldhavebeen/pontem/. Peoplewhomade\nthe mistakes simply couldn\u2019t hear the difference. (Which is not to say that there\nis none; only that it was too small to be noticeable.) Also, in verse dating from\nthattimetheendingsinvowelplus/m/countedasnonexistentforthemetre. (This\nin turn we know for sure because we know what the metre was.) This is strong Lecture19: LanguageFamiliesandHistoryofLanguages 199\nevidence that already in classical times the final /m/ was not pronounced. The\nnext method is through looking at borrowings into other languages. The name\n/Caesar/ (and the title that derived from it) was borrowed into many languages,\nand appears in the form of /Kaiser/ in German, taken from Gothic /kaisar/,\nand /c\u00e9sar/ [seza:r] in French. So, at the time the Goths borrowed the word the\nletter /c/ it was pronounced [k]. And since French descends from Latin we must\nconclude that the Gothic borrowing is older. Moreover, there was a diphthong.\nThe diphthong was the first to disappear, becoming plain long [e:], and then [k]\nchanged into [s] in French and [tS] in Italian and Rumanian. A third source is\nthe alphabet itself. The Romans did not distinguish /v/ from /u/. They wrote /v/\nregardless. This shows that the two were not felt to be distinct. It is unlikely that\n/v/ was pronounced [v] (as in English /vase/). Rather, it was originally a bilabial\napproximant (the nonsyllabic \u2217w mentioned above), which became a labiodental\nfricativeonlylater.\nHistorical explanations are usually based on a lot of knowledge. Languages\nconsistoftensofthousandsofwords,butmostofthemarenotindigenouswords.\nMany words that we use in the scientific context, for example, come from Latin\nand/or Greek. Moreover, they have been borrowed from these languages at any\nmoment in time. The linguistic terminology (/phoneme/, /lexeme/) is a telling\nexample. These words have been artificially created from Greek source words.\nLearned words have to be discarded. Another problem is that words change their\nmeaninginadditiontotheirform. AnexampleisGerman/schlimm/\u2018bad\u2019,which\noriginally meant \u2018inclined\u2019. Or the word /vergammeln/ \u2018to rot\u2019, which is from\nScandinavian /gamall/ \u2018old\u2019. English /but/ derives from a spatial preposition,\nwhichisstillfoundinDutch/buiten/\u2018outside\u2019. Fromthereittookmoreabstract\nmeanings, until the spatial meaning was completely lost. If that is so, we have\nto be very cautious. If meanings would be constant, we could easily track words\nback in time; we just had to look at words in the related languages that had the\nsamemeaning. Butifalsothemeaningcanchange\u2014whatarewetolookoutfor?\nLinguists have put a lot of effort into determining in which ways the meanings of\nwordscangoandwhichmeaningsaremorestablethanothers.\nTwo Examples Among Many\nAs an example of the beauty and danger of historical linguistics, we give the\nhistoryoftwowords. 200 Lecture19: LanguageFamiliesandHistoryofLanguages\nThe first example shows that once we know of the rules, the resemblances\nbecomeverystriking. TheEnglishword/choose/hasrelativesinDutchandGer-\nman. If we look at the verbs that these languages normally use, we might get\ndisappointed: the Dutch word is /kiezen/, and the German is /w\u00e4hlen/. The re-\nlation between Dutch and the English are easier seen. First notice that the Dutch\nverbhasaperfectparticiple/gekozen/\u2018chosen\u2019,whichhasthe/o/inplaceofthe\n/ie/. The change from [e] to [o], called Ablaut, is widely attested in the Indo-\nEuropean languages. Now, [k] often becomes [tS] before either [e] or [i] (like\nLatin [ke] became [tSe] in Italian, often with loss of /e/ in pronunciation). Now,\nthis change occurred in English only, not in Dutch. However, we still have to\nsee why Ablaut occured in English. The Old English word in fact was /ce\u00afosan/.\n(When no star appears that means that we have written records.) The pronunci-\nation of /c/ changed and incorporated the /e/, and the infinitive ending got lost\nlike with other verbs. The German case seems hopeless. In fact, /w\u00e4hlen/ does\nnot come from a related root. However, in German we do find a verb /kiesen/\nin similar meaning, although it is now no longer in use. Strangely enough, the\nperfect passive participle (PPP) of the verb /auserkiesen/ (two prefixes added,\n/aus/and/er/)isstillinuse: /auserkoren/\u2018chosen\u2019. Theverbitselfisnolonger\ninuse. NoticethattheablautisthesameasisDutch,whichincidentallyalsouses\nthe circumfix /ge- -en/ as does German. Finally, in German the PPP has /r/ in\nplace of /s/ (which would be pronounced [z]). The change from /s/ to /r/ in be-\ntweenvowels(called\u2018rhotacism\u2019)isapopularchange. (Therearemoreexamples.\nThe English /was/ is cognate to Dutch /was/, but German has /war/.) Latin has\nplentyofexamplesofthis.\nNow,therootfromwhichallthisderivesisbelievedtobeGermanic\u2217/keusa/\n\u2018to try out, choose\u2019. Once we have progressed this far, other words come into\nsight: Latin/gustare/\u2018totaste\u2019(fromwhichviaFrenchEnglishgot/disgusting/),\nGreek /geuomai/ \u2018I taste\u2019, Sanskrit /ju\u015bati/ \u2018he likes\u2019, Old Irish /do-goa/ \u2018to\nchoose\u2019\u2014they all look like cognates to this one. Indeed, from all these words\none has reconstructed the root \u2217/geus/ \u2018to choose\u2019. The Latin word presents the\nzero-grade\u2217/gus/. (Rootstypicallyhad/e/. Ablautisthechangeof/e/to/o/. The\nzero grade is the version of the root that has no /e/. Similarly, \u2217/dik/ is the zero\ngradeof\u2217/deik/\u2018toshow\u2019.) InWestGermanicwehave/kuzi/\u2018vote,choice\u2019. But\nbeware: French/choisir/doesnot comefromLatin\u2014thereisnowaytoexplain\nthis with known sound laws. For example, it cannot be derived from /gustare/.\nKnown sound laws predict /gustare/ to develop into /go\u00fbter/, and this is what\nwe find. Instead /choisir/ was taken from\u2014Gothic! Indeed, French has taken Lecture19: LanguageFamiliesandHistoryofLanguages 201\nloanwords from Germanic, being occupied/inhabited in large parts by Germanic\ntribes. Thename/France/itselfderivesfromthenameofatribe: /Frankon/.\nWith respect to Dutch and German the reconstruction is actually easy, since\nthe languages split around the 17th century. Certain dialects of North Germany\nstill have [p] where others have [pf]. It often happens that a word is not attested\ninalllanguages. Forexample,English/horse/correspondstoDutch/paard/and\nGerman/Pferd/,withsamemeaning. Thesoundlawsallowtoassertthat/paard/\nand /Pferd/ descend from the same word, but for English /horse/ this is highly\nimplausible. There is a German word, /Ross/ \u2018horse\u2019, and a Dutch /ros/, which\nsound quite similar, but they are far less frequent. What we have to explain is\nwhythewordsaredifferent. Now,weareluckytohavesourceconfirmingthatthe\nword was sometimes spelt /hros/ sometimes /ros/ in Old German. In Icelandic,\nit is still /hross/. The loss of /h/ before /r/ is attested also in other cases, like the\nword /ring/. But the change happened in English, too, and the only reason why\nthe/h/waspreservedin/horse/isthatthe/r/changedplaceswith/o/.\nFinally,wheredidDutchandGermangettheirwordsfrom? Bothwordscome\nfromthesamesource,butitisnotGermanic,itisMedievalLatin/paraveredus/\n\u2018post-horse\u2019 (200 - 900 AD), which in turn is /para/ + /veredus/. /para/ comes\nfrom Greek (!) /para/ \u2018aside\u2019, and /veredus/ is Celtic. It is composed from /ve/\n\u2018under\u2019 and /reda/ \u2018coach\u2019. In Kymric there is a word /gorwydd/ \u2018horse\u2019. So,\n/paraveredus/hadamorespecialmeaning: itwasthehorsethatwasrunningon\nthe side. (The coach had two horses, one on the right and one on the left; the one\non the left was saddled, and the one on the right was the \u2018side horse\u2019.) English\nhas a word /palfrey/, which denotes a kind of riding horse. The Indo-European\nroot that has been reconstructed is \u2217ekwos. Latin /equus/, Greek /hippos/ and\nSanskrit /a\u015bva .h/. Had we not known that the Latin word is /equus/, we would\nhavehadtoguessfromFrench/cheval/andSpanish/caballo/.\nThus, roots do not survive everywhere. Words get borrowed, changed, re-\nturned and so on. There are not too many roots that are attested in all languages,\nmostlykinshipterms,personalpronounsandnumbers.\nOther Language Families\nIn addition to Indo-European, there is another language family in Europe: the\nUralic language family. The languages that are said to belong to that family are 202\nFinnish, Estonian, Lappish, Hungarian and a number of lesser known languages\nspoken in the north of Russia. The affiliation of Hungarian is nowadays not dis-\nputed, but in the 19th century it was believed to be related to Turkish. Unfortu-\nnately, the written records of these languages are at most 1000 years old, and the\nsimilarities are not always that great. Finnish, Estonian and Lappish can be seen\nto be related, but Hungarian is very much different. This may have to do with\nthe fact that it was under heavy influence from Slavic, Turkish (the Turks occu-\npied Hungary for a long time) and Germanic (not the least through the Habsburg\nmonarchy).\nTheaffiliationofBasqueisunknown.\nOtherrecognizedlanguagefamiliesare: Semitic(includingHebrew,Ethiopic,\nAmharic, Aramaic and Arabic), Altaic (Turkish, Tatar, Tungus and Mongolian),\nDravidian (spoken in the south of India: Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malay-\nalam), Austronesian (Malay, Indonesian, Malagassy, languages spoken on Ma-\ncronesia, Micronesia and Polynesia), Eskimo-Aleut (Inuit (= Eskimo), indige-\nnous languages spoken in Canada, Greenland, Western Siberia and the Aleut Is-\nlands). The list is not complete. Sometimes languages are grouped together be-\ncauseitisbelievedthattheyarerelated,butrelationshipsareactuallyhardtocome\nby. This is the case with the Caucasian languages (Georgian and many others).\nIt is believed that the people who live there have not moved for several millenia.\nThishasgivenrisetoadazzlingnumberofquitedistinctlanguagesinarelatively\nsmallareainandaroundthesouthernpartoftheCaucasianmountains.\nProbing Deeper in Time\nIt has been tried to probe deeper into the history of mankind. One way to do\nthis is to classify people along genetic relations (a large project with this aim\nhas been led by Cavalli-Sforza), another has been to establish larger groupings\namong the languages. Although genetic relationships need not coincide with lan-\nguage relationships, the two are to a large degree identical. Two hypotheses are\nbeing investigated starting from Indo-European. Joseph Greenberg proposed a\nmacrofamily called Eurasiatic, which includes Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic,\nEskimo-Aleut, Korean, Japanese and Ainu (spoken in the north of Japan) and\nChukchi-Kamchatkan. It has been suggested on the other hand by Russian lin-\nguists (Illyc\u02c7-Svityc\u02c7 and Dolgopolsky) that there is an even larger macrofamily 203\ncalled Nostratic, which originally was believed to include all Eurasiatic families,\nAfro-Asiatic(spanningnorthAfricaincludingSemitic),DravidianandKartvelian\n(= Caucasian). Greenberg did not reject the existence of Nostratic but wanted to\nput it even farther back in history, as a language which developed among other\ninto Eurasiatic. Moreover, the position of modern Nostraticists has come closer\nto that of Greenberg\u2019s views. At a larger scale there are believed to be twelve\nsuch macrofamilies in this world, all ultimately coming from a single language\n... Examples of words that are believed to have been passed to us by the single\nancestor language are /kuan/ \u2018dog\u2019; /mano/ \u2018man\u2019; /mena/ \u2018think (about)\u2019; /mi(n)/\n\u2018what\u2019; / Paq\u2019wa/ \u2018water\u2019; /tik/ \u2018finger, one\u2019; and /pal/ \u2018two\u2019 (see Merrit Ruhlen\n& John Bengtson: Global Etymologies, in Merrit Ruhlen: On the Origin of Lan-\nguages, Stanford University Press, 1994, 277\u2013336). This is highly speculative,\nbut the evidence for Eurasiatic (or even Nostratic) is not as poor as one might\nthink. Common elements in Eurasiatic are for example: first person in m, second\nperson in t/n. Greenberg has collected a list of some 250 words or elements that\nare believed to be of Eurasiatic origin.
