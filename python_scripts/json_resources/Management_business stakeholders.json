Home Subjects\nBoundless Management\nEthics in Business\nBusiness Stakeholders\nInternal Stakeholders\nInternal stakeholders, primarily employees, owners and managers, are directly involved in the operations and strategy of the organization.\nLearning Objectives\nDifferentiate between internal and external stakeholders.\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nInternal stakeholders are individuals or groups who are directly and/or financially involved in the operational process.\nExternal stakeholders are indirectly influenced by the organization 's operations.\nEmployees and managers are internal stakeholders impacted by organizational strategy and success, with some influence on the\norganization's decisions.\nOwners have a larger impact on organizational management, and take a larger amount of accountability compared to managers and\nemployees.\nKey Terms\nstakeholders: People or organizations with a legitimate interest in a given situation, action, or enterprise.\nStakeholder Theory\nOrganizational management is largely influenced by the opinions and perspectives of internal and external stakeholders. A stakeholder is\nany group, individual, or community that is impacted by the operations of the organization, and therefore must be granted a voice in how\nthe organization functions. External stakeholders have no financial stake in the organization, but are indirectly influenced by the\norganization's operations.\nInternal Stakeholders\nInternal stakeholders are individuals or groups who are directly and/or financially involved in the operational process. This includes\nemployees, owners, and managers. Each of these groups is potentially rewarded directly for the success of the firm.\nEmployees\nEmployees are primary internal stakeholders. Employees have significant financial and time investments in the organization, and play a\ndefining role in the strategy, tactics, and operations the organization carries out. Well run organizations take into account employee\nopinions, concerns, and values in shaping the strategy, vision, and mission of the firm.\nManagers\nManagers play a substantial role in determining the strategy of the organization, and a significant voice in operational decisions.\nManagers are also accountable for the decisions made, and act as a point of contact between shareholders, the board of directors, and\nthe organization itself.\nOwners\nOwners (who in publicly traded organizations can include shareholders) are the individuals who hold significant shares of the firm. Owners\nare liable for the impacts the organization has, and have a significant role in strategy. Owners often make substantial decisions regarding\nboth internal and external stakeholders.\nStakeholders for a Search Engine: This graphic is a good illustration\nof the stakeholders involved in a search engine organization. Various\ngroups are impacted by their operations, such as consumers, owners,\nfinanciers, governments, and advertisers. Owners are directly involved\nin the process, and thus described as internal stakeholders.\nExternal Stakeholders\nIntegrating businesses into society results in a wide variety of interactions with a number of different external stakeholder groups.\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify the various external stakeholders that may be impacted by business operations\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nUnderstanding the impacts (positive or negative) of the organization upon the broader external environment is more easily accomplished\nwhen different groups of stakeholders are identified.\nCustomers, suppliers, and governments are all directly impacted by the operations carried out in a financial way. As a result, these\nstakeholder groups tend to be quite closely in tune with business operations.\nLocal and global communities are less directly impacted (financially) by business, but no less relevant when it comes to stakeholder-based\ndecision -making.\nBusinesses can have severely negative impacts on the local and global environment, and so must carefully consider how operational\nfunctioning can affect the well-being of the individuals in these communities.\nKey Terms\nstakeholder theory: A theory of organizational management and business ethics that addresses morals and values in managing an\norganization.\nBusiness are complex pieces in the social ecosystem, both impacted by and impacting a wide variety of groups in the external\nenvironment. As a leader or manager at an organization, understanding both internal and external stakeholder needs is a central\nresponsibility. Decisions should be made in a way that ensures all stakeholders are considered.\nExternal Stakeholders\nThere are quite a few external stakeholders for businesses to keep in mind when making decisions and carrying out operations. These\ninclude but are not limited to customers, suppliers, creditors, communities, governments, and society at large:\nCustomers\nThe primary purpose of providing goods and services is to fill needs. Understanding the needs of an organization's core customer base,\nand optimizing operations to best fill those needs, is therefore a significant part of managing a business. Interacting with customers\nthrough social media, emails, storefronts, user testing groups, and the delivery of services and goods is an important aspect of\nmaintaining a strong community (and a strong sense of what customers want from the organization).\nNowadays, big data plays a significant role in determining what users want. By understanding trends, habits, and trajectories in user data,\norganizations can anticipate the needs of users and refine their value proposition.\nSuppliers\nSuppliers and other strategic alliances are interdependent, where the success of one will impact the success of another. As a result,\nsuppliers are closely related to organizations as key external stakeholders. Timely payments, shipments, communication, and operational\nprocesses are key to maintaining a strong relationship with this stakeholder group.\nLocal community\nA business can be a great benefit to a community, providing tax money, local access to unique goods and services, jobs, and community\ndevelopment programs. However, a business can also be a drain on a community by increasing traffic, creating pollution, hurting small\nbusinesses, and altering real estate prices. As a result, businesses must look at the needs of the community, and ensure that negative\nrepercussions are minimized while community engagement is maximized.\nGovernment\nGovernments tax businesses, and therefore have a firm stake in their success. Governments can in fact be considered primary\nstakeholders, considering the profit motive involved. Governments also provide regulatory oversight, ensuring that accounting\nprocedures, ethical practices, and legal concerns are being handled responsibly by business representatives.\nBroader Society\nAs a result of the digital and global economy, a business can have a significant impact on society at large. Companies such as Airbnb and\nUber have transformed entire industries, creating dynamically different economies with a wider variety of participants than ever. Walmart\nhas substantially impacted the viability of small businesses in many regions. The food that is sold at fast food chains has huge impacts on\nglobal health. Manufacturing facilities in developing nations are transforming entire ecosystems. Social networks are collecting vast\namounts of data. All of these concepts aren't intrinsically good or bad, but managing them to ensure outcomes are positive for society as\na whole is a critical responsibility.\nOther\nWhile other stakeholder groups could be discussed at length, these are a few of the key pillars in stakeholder theory.\nStakeholders: This chart underlines some of the main internal and\nexternal stakeholders leaders will consider when looking at the\nimplications of business operations.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
