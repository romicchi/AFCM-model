Punishment is a controver-\nsial topic, but one that parents face daily: to use or not to use? I have worked with\nmany parents who are haunted by ill feelings when they resort to consequences for\ntheir children\u2019s misbehavior. They are told punishment is often ineffective. They\nhave been led to believe that their actions have more to do with their own needs than\na desire to teach their children right from wrong. In some cases, they are made to feel\nthat they may have possibly facilitated negative long-term effects on their children\u2019s\ndevelopment, or even engaged in abusive behavior. Many parents therefore question\nthe use of punishment, but have not come up with an effective alternative. As a result,\nthey use it sporadically and hence render it ineffective.\nProfessionals, parents and teachers need answers that are based on factual\ninformation. Punishment on Trial provides that source. Effective punishment can take\nmany forms, most of which do not involve physical punishment. This book\ndemystifies punishment for the reader. Punishment on Trial explores common myths\nheld about punishment, and presents scientific evidence and logic to debunk such\nmyths. Techniques that alter undesirable child behavior, backed by research studies\na well as real live cases, are presented. Finally a model for a responsible use of\npunishment is presented.\nI have attempted to convey this information in an easy to read and entertaining\nstyle, while providing a factual basis for the information. This book hopefully\npresents a nice blend of science, clinical experience, and logic to a discussion of the\nefficacy of punishment for child behavior problems. viii\nAcknowledgments\nI am indebted to Dr. Mary Burch, Petra Sutton and Lucy DeRose for their\nconstructive editing of the manuscript. I would also like to express my appreciation\nto Steve Eversol, Hiroaki Uemura, Adam Nelson, and Gloria Lopez for their\nthoughtful comments on earlier drafts of the book. I also thank Vanessa Cipani for\nher design of the book cover. Finally, I wish to thank Dr. Jon Bailey, Florida State\nUniversity, for all of his help and advice over the past 27 years. ix\nTable of Contents\nAbout the Author .............................................................................................vi\nPreface ............................................................................................................vii\nAcknowledgments.......................................................................................... viii\nCases ..............................................................................................................x\nIntroduction.....................................................................................................11\nSection I: What is Punishment?.....................................................................17\nSection II: Exposing Myths About Punishment..........................................23\nMyth #1: Punishment Does Not Work ...................................................24\nMyth #2: Punishment Temporarily Suppresses Behavior\n(and Therefore Is Not Worth the Effort)..........................................44\nMyth #3: Punishment Causes Problems for a Child's Emotional\nDevelopment......................................................................................54\nMyth #4: Punishment Is Not as Effective as Reinforcement...................72\nMyth #5: Time-out Does Not Work........................................................86\nSection III: Six Basic Principles of Punishment.........................................101\nPrinciple I: There Must Exist a Behavioral Contingency.......................101\nPrinciple II: Be Consistent ......................................................................106\nPrinciple III: The \u201cEven Swap\u201d Rule.......................................................113\nPrinciple IV: Remove Competing Consequences..................................117\nPrinciple V: Be Specific ...........................................................................120\nPrinciple VI: Prove It Works ...................................................................121\nSection IV: A Responsible Use of Punishment .........................................125\nReferences......................................................................................................135 x\nCases\nThe Case of Boys Will Be Boys\u2014 Reducing Aggressive Behavior\nin Preschool Children......................................................................12\nWhat Really Happened in the \u201cGood Ole Days?\u201d...........................................20\nIt Will Never Work with These Kids! ...............................................................25\nThe Case of: \u201cI did not know what else to do\u2014 so I tied him to a chair!\u201d ......37\nThe Case of: \u201cIf I could turn back the hands of time.\u201d....................................40\nDoing Nothing is a Risky Venture?...................................................................42\nThe Case of: \u201cStealing is in His Blood!\u201d...........................................................47\nThe Power of Parental Consequences- the Case of Getting Dressed...............52\nThe Case of: \u201cI Grew to Love You.\u201d.................................................................63\nThe Case of: \u201cSo You Won\u2019t Take a Time-out.\u201d..............................................69\nGot Meds?..........................................................................................................76\nTeaching Children How to Peacefully Co-exist with Pets................................80\nThe Case of: \u201cOne More Strike and You Are Out!\u201d........................................84\nThe Case of: \u201cI Hope You Learned Your Lesson!\u201d..........................................91\nWhat Happens On the Planet Freudania? ......................................................102\nThe Case of the Future \u201cWWE\u201d Star: The Price of Persistence.....................108\nThe Case of the Intimate Disclosure...............................................................115\nThe Case of: You Cannot Go to the YMCA Because You\nHit Someone- So Let\u2019s Go Out for Donuts..................................118\nHe Likes to Be Restrained!...............................................................................119\nCase Study- A Responsible Use of Punishment..............................................130 11\nIntroduction\nPunishment as a means to change misbehavior of children is a controversial\ntopic, to say the least. Persons advocating the use of punishment and those people\nwho are against the use of punishment have often resorted to claims that may or may\nnot have a basis in scientific evidence. What is even more distressing is that the\nvalidity of such claims and theories is rarely questioned or judged. Uttering the\nwords, \u201cWe have research that shows,\u201d or \u201cWe have findings,\u201d often is taken to\nsanctify whatever position is being proposed, without any independent judgment of\nthe validity of the purported research. Therefore the claims made on the basis of such\nresearch often go unquestioned.\nHow controversial is this topic? If you advocate for the use of punishment, your\nprofessional and personal reputation is questioned and your expertise is debased.\nMany people in professional and administrative capacities have had to quickly refute\ntheir position on punishment, to avoid severe professional and political conse-\nquences. Galileo\u2019s dealings with the papacy in the 16th century may seem like small\nclaims court when compared to the wrath of people who stand to judge those who\nsupport the use of punishment. Further, what is considered off limits, in both\npractice and research inquires from the professional police squad, can be a most\ninnocuous consequence for child behavior (to most American parents).\nLest I give you the impression that the zealots just exist on the side demanding\nthat any form of punishment be outlawed, let me correct that impression. The\nadvocates for using physical punishment can be just as adamant. There is a rising tide\nin this country that attributes much of our woes in raising children (or our inability\nto do such) to the removal of corporal punishment in schools and homes.\nThe topic of punishment is rarely portrayed as a useful strategy in books and\nprofessional presentations. Many authors skirt the topic, for fear of retribution by\neither side. On the one hand you have some people intimating that you are an\nabusive adult if you state that your child has broken a rule, in a voice harsher than\nMr. Rogers. If you then proceed to \u201cpunish\u201d the child by making him miss cartoons\nthat afternoon for the infraction, you have really stepped over the line. According\nto these experts, you may even have gone so far as to destroy his self-esteem and\nproduce long-term damage to his psychological disposition when he enters adult-\nhood! These people equate punishment with abusive behavior. They rely on\nunproven theories to justify their vilification of punishment and the people that use\nit. They often cite cases in the media of child abuse, and equate such abuse with\npunishment, therefore, evidence that all punishment should be banned. The\ninference they want you to draw is the following. If a parent starts using punishment\ntechniques, she or he is \u201con the road\u201d to becoming a child abuser.\nOn the other extreme, some people believe that severe physical punishment is\nneeded. Anything less is soft and un-American. Their evidence that punishment is\nlacking in today\u2019s society comes from the rash of school shootings, teenage 12 Introduction\npregnancies and other ills that would not be existent if corporal punishment were in\nfull force. After all, spanking was a part of Americana when we were growing up. Look\nhow much has changed for the worse.\nI undertook the writing of this book to provide a basis of fact for adults struggling\nto make sense of their own discipline policies. Through a better understanding of the\neffects of punishment, and the conditions under which it is ineffective, parents and\nprofessionals would be better equipped to handle child behavior. A decision to use\nor not use punishment should be made on the scientific merits of a procedure. At\nthe heart of the decision should be the goal of changing the behavior of children in\nthe most effective and reasonable manner. Shouldn\u2019t your judgment about punish-\nment be a function of how you want your child to behave and what is the best means\nof obtaining such behavior?\nIt is to this end that this book attempts to provide factual information and dispel\nsome of the fictional representations regarding punishment. It does so by putting\npunishment on trial. I will provide research evidence on the efficacy of punishment\nprocedures. Additionally, I will submit my own judgments, based on two decades\nof practice in child behavior therapy. It is of course your choice as to whether your\nown discipline strategy will incorporate certain consequences that might function as\npunishers. You, the reader will certainly be better informed regarding the truth about\npunishment (and also reinforcement). Hopefully this will allow you to place into a\nscientific perspective what you hear other people say about punishment.\nThis book will probably change your understanding of what constitutes\npunishment (in the technical sense). As your first test on what constitutes punish-\nment, please read the case presented below. Was punishment used to deal with\naggressive behavior on the playground?\nThe Case of Boys Will Be Boys\u2014\nReducing Aggressive Behavior in Preschool Children\nI was asked to consult with Head Start programs in regards to the\nbehavioral problems of some of the children attending the morning or\nafternoon program. A prototype of a frequent request for consultation was\nfor a child (usually a boy) who was aggressive to other children.\nOne of my first consultations was for a boy who was frequently\naggressive. In my observation, I noted a phenomenon that seemed to be the\ncatalyst for this child\u2019s aggression during the outside free play period. When\nthe children were sent outside for playground activities, arguments and\nfights erupted around the use of the 3 available tricycles. As you might\nguess, about 10 kids wanted to ride the 3 bikes, all at the same time. The\nchildren argued and pushed each other away from the bike in order to\nestablish themselves as the bike riders. Once a child landed in the seat, she\nor he usually went unchallenged (kind of like \u201cKing of the Mountain\u201d). As 13\nyou could guess, my client was quite good at getting the bike, and keeping\nit.\nFrom my observation, I noted that the teachers did not seem to\nintervene during the squabbling over the bikes. I saw a child approach a\nteacher and complain, \u201cBilly won\u2019t share the bike. He keeps riding it.\u201d The\nteacher bent down and said, \u2018Now Suzy, you go back to Billy and see if you\ncan work something out.\u201d Suzy went back to Billy and apparently what got\nworked out was the following: If Suzy leaves Billy alone, he will not hit her\nor push her down. If she tries to take the bike from him, she will be judged\nas an intruder and dealt with.\u201d\nI asked the teacher what her advice was over the dispute with the bike.\nShe remarked, \u201cOur philosophy here is that we want the children to learn\nto work out their problems on their own. If we solve their interpersonal\nsquabbles and problems, they will never learn to develop self-control and\npersonal responsibility to themselves and their fellow human being!\u201d Ok,\nI see. That explains the mortal combat approach to child interactions on the\nplayground. Maybe I misread the sign on the front of the building. Instead\nof observing a Head Start program, I must have mistakenly entered a\ntoddler boot camp for future hockey players.\nI first had to convince the teachers that the survival of the fittest\ncontests for possession of the 3 bikes was a large contributing factor to\naggression on the playground. Subsequently, the plan I set up had two\ncomponents. First, any incident of aggression resulted in the offending\nchild going to a time-out area for 3 minutes. That child could not play with\nany of the playground equipment or toys at this time, but merely sat on the\nbench for the 3-minute period. Following the time-out, she or he returned\nto play with any toy not being used by another child. This basically\nremoved the opportunity to ride the bike for that play period for offenders.\nThe second component of the intervention focused on teaching\nchildren that a negotiated settlement is in their best interests. For example,\nif 2 or more children wanted to ride a given bike, one or both would come\nto the teacher and present their dilemma. The bike time was divided evenly.\nThe teacher praised the children for bringing their problem to her and then\nset the portable oven timer for two minutes. One child was assigned to ride\nit for that 2-minute period. Following the timer ringing, that child would\nget off the bike and the teacher directed the other student to the bike for\nhis or her 2-minute period. In summary, aggressive behavior resulted in\ntime-out and loss of the opportunity to ride the bike. Bringing the matter\nto the \u201cteacher\u2019s court\u201d for judgment, and not taking matters into one\u2019s own\nhands, resulted in a negotiated settlement.\nAs you might have guessed, aggressive behavior dropped dramatically\nwith this intervention. It is also important to note that the teachers 14 Introduction\nremarked that the children were now bringing their issues surrounding toys\nand bikes to them more often. It is interesting how time-out will teach\nchildren to find a more acceptable way to work out their impulsive\nbehavior. What was also an interesting finding in this program was that\nmany of the children who needed the bike right away learned one of two\nthings: how to wait, or how to find something else interesting to play with\nthat was not in as great a demand as the bikes. Isn\u2019t human nature funny\nthat way?\nOverview of Punishment on Trial\nThis material is divided into four sections. The first section is entitled, What is\nPunishment? This section covers basic material with respect to \u201coutcome-oriented\npunishment\u201d as a means to change child behavior. The importance of using an\noutcome-oriented definition of punishment is stressed and the ramifications of such\na definition are delineated. The second section, Exposing Myths about Punishment,\nreviews 5 misunderstandings surrounding punishment. The evidence regarding the\nmyth (or lack thereof) is given and its validity debunked. Research supporting more\nvalid conclusions is provided and the factors parents should consider are also\nprovided.\nIn the third section, Six Basic Principles, requisite practices derived from\nscientific research on punishment are delineated. Such principles are often abused,\nviolated and ignored, which leads to many misconceptions about punishment from\nlay and professional audiences alike. Throughout the book, personal clinical cases\nare detailed to illustrate a point. Subsequent to the case presentation, several\nquestions are presented for you to contemplate. The last section, A Responsible Use\nof Punishment, covers the considerations when using punishment to change child\nbehavior. If you choose to use consequences, this section will provide guidelines for\nimplementation of a child behavior plan.\nA Psychologist Who Makes House Calls\nIn this book, I present scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of punishment\nprocedures as well as drawbacks. However, in certain areas, the research data are not\noverwhelming and/or compelling. I fill in these areas with actual cases of families in\nneed of help, as well as my opinions based on serving many families over a two-\ndecade period. However, you will be made aware of what is scientific fact and what\nrepresents conjecture on my part. To judge my opinions as credible (or not), I believe\nit is important to gain a perspective about my experience.\nI came to California in 1981 in order to take a position at a university teacher-\ntraining program. Additionally, I was interested in clinical work and began contract-\ning with agencies serving families who have children with developmental disabilities.\nWhile I had considerable experience working with this population in state institu- 15\ntions, this was my first experience working with families in their homes. A unique\nmodel of service called behavioral intervention service (BIS) was used. BIS was unlike\nanything I had seen before in its approach to providing help to families. BIS was a\nsystem that required me, as the professional, to go to the family\u2019s residence or the\nchild\u2019s school and conduct the assessment of problem child behavior in the real life\nsetting. In other words, it is an in-home, parent training, program. Even today this\nis unique within mental health programs, since services to clients are almost\nexclusively done in the professional office.\nI would draw up a plan to deal with the child\u2019s problem behavior, by re-arranging\nthe manner in which the parent(s) would deal with problem and appropriate\nbehavior. Subsequent to the written plan, I initiated the parent training phase. Once\nagain, this phase was conducted in the child\u2019s home, day care or school. Imagine that,\na psychologist who makes house calls.\nBeing on the \u201cbattleground\u201d served to educate me in a manner that very few\nother mental health professionals experience. Maybe in the treatment of physical\nillness, physicians do not have to see the person sick in their own home to appreciate\nthe problem and the potential solution. After all, the target symptoms of the disease\nare probably as readily observable in the doctor\u2019s office as they would be in the child\u2019s\nhome. However, the same is not the case with human behavior. How can one\ndetermine what really goes on when the family leaves the office? Unlike some\nhelping professionals who may doubt the complaints of the parents as more a\nsymptom of their pathology, I saw with my own eyes what transpired when it was\ntime to come to the dinner table. You know the old saying, seeing is believing! And\nit truly can be an eye opening experience. My advice to people who want to help\nparents: See what it is like to walk in their shoes by showing up at homework time.\nOnly then will you truly appreciate what these parents go through, day in and day\nout.\nAn additional advantage of this in-home model of training is that it allowed me\nto provide on-the-spot coaching to the parent. This approach is much more effective\nthan sitting in an office trying to explain how to do something. Here is a case in point.\nA child, who was 4 at the time, engaged in disruptive or destructive behavior\nregularly. As I visited with his mother, his sister and him, the first time, I was amazed\nat what I saw for the next hour or so. As I watched him, while gathering basic\ninformation from his mother, it seemed as if there was not a minute that elapsed\nwithout his doing something disruptive and/or destructive. He was either hitting his\nsister, dumping utensils on the floor, slamming the door on the way outside, or\nthrowing things in the house. He was running around the house like a hurricane\nfeeding off moist air. I got tired just watching him and I was sitting down (and a lot\nyounger than I am now).\nI decided that it would be best if we targeted just one problem initially and let\nthe others go for the time being. His mother did not seem to mind some of the\n\u201chyperactive\u201d problems, so I felt that the aggression to his sister must be our first\nintervention target. I recommended that we use time-out to the corner when he hit 16 Introduction\nor slapped his sister. She agreed and I demonstrated the time-out procedure to her\nbefore scheduling the next appointment. On the next home visit, she and I would\ndeploy the time-out for acts of aggression toward his sister.\nUpon my arrival on \u201cD-Day,\u201d I reminded her of the time-out consequence for\naggression toward his sister. I would watch and coach her while she monitored his\nbehavior and provide time-out when he hit or slapped his sister. I can tell you that\nif I had not been there, the time-out program would not have even gotten one toe\noff the ground. It took several aggressions on his part, with my running in to provide\nthe time-out, before she realized that she would have to watch him a little bit closer.\nI could almost see her remark; \u201cThis time-out plan is tougher than it sounds.\u201d\nShe did improve. Towards the end of the first training session, she was catching\nabout half of the incidences without my cueing (still inadequate). If I had just seen\nher in my office, she probably would have reported that she tried the time-out and\nit did not work. I would not have been privy to the fact that she failed to use it. Here\nis a news flash for Associated Press: Time-out only works if you use it consistently.\nSimply announcing to the child that you are now a time-out trained parent does not\nimpress the child if you don\u2019t follow through. Imagine that!\nMy opinion about the effects of punishment is not based solely on what surveys\nreport many parents say about punishment. My clinical experience is not comprised\nprimarily of talking to people about their problems, commiserating with their plight\nand then simply explaining behavior from a theoretical perspective. I was given the\nassignment of helping a family overcome some moderate to severe behavioral\nchallenges exhibited by one or more of their children. My task was to problem solve\non how such debilitating behaviors can be ameliorated or eliminated, to allow such\nfamilies to grow as a unit in greater harmony.\nEach time my behavioral specialists and I solved a behavioral problem, we grew\nin our understanding of how to help future families. Our being in the thick of things\nhas allowed us to discern those procedures that are effective from those procedures\nthat sound great but do not often deliver. I hope my experience with real life families\nin their homes makes for enjoyable reading! 17\nSection I:\nWhat is Punishment?\nPunishment is a not just a controversial topic, it is often misunderstood. It can\nmean apples to one group of people and bananas to another. Yet both groups would\ninsist, in heated arguments, that they are talking about the same phenomenon. One\ngroup would describe apples, and their color, texture and shape. The other group\nwould violently reject this supposition, saying that if one were not color blind, one\ncould plainly see that this phenomenon is yellow in color, and describe a banana.\nIn other words, each group would describe a different phenomenon, but use the\nsame term to define it.\nHow does the analogy about apples and bananas apply to punishment? Take a\nlook at the examples below which are statements with a reference to punishment.\n\u201cHe really punished him by sending him to his room.\u201d\n\u201cThe boxer gave the challenger some punishing blows to the midsection.\u201d\n\u201cThe man\u2019s punishment for driving without a license was 6 months\nprobation.\u201d\n\u201cThe child was punished for grabbing the cereal off the shelf.\u201d\nWhich of the above are examples of punishment? It depends on your definition\nof punishment. There have certainly been numerous books and other writings on\nthe topic of punishment. A cursory review of an online book distributor\n(www.barnesandnoble.com) found over 1,200 books listed under the subject\nheading of punishment. You would think that with all that material there would be\nagreement on the phenomenon described as punishment. The vast majority of these\nbooks deal with punishment from the judicial perspective. Punishment is often\nequated with the sentence a judge (or jury) hands down when a guilty verdict is given.\nIt is the imposition of a harsh set of conditions, as a result of some offending\nbehavior, which characterizes punishment in much of these writings.\nThis perspective of punishment exemplifies what I will term as the \u201cprocedural\ndefinition of punishment\u201d (Grusec & Walters, 1977). This definition merely requires\nthe existence of two temporally ordered events (referred to as a contingency). First,\nsome law violation behavior occurs (perpetrator is caught and successfully pros-\necuted). Second, the consequence is the imposition of the sentence, which is deemed\nto be of an aversive nature to the individual.\nThe procedural definition best fits the common use of the term, punishment,\nwhen referring to examples of punishment. Punishment is viewed as the imposition\nof a harsh consequence for a child\u2019s misbehavior. There exists a conditional\nrelationship between what the child does and a consequence that befalls him or her. 18 Section I\nIf the child engages in a misbehavior, then a harsh or aversive condition is imposed.\nThis is how many people define punishment.\nWhat are some examples of this procedural use of the term, punishment? If\nJohnny hits his sister, he will go to bed. If Suzie has a tantrum, she will be sent to the\ncorner for 20 minutes. If Raul hits his mother, he will get spanked. According to the\nprocedural definition, the existence of punishment is determined via a subjective\njudgment regarding the harshness of the consequence. Did Johnny, Suzy, and Raul\nall receive punishment? Well, that depends on you, the judge.\nWith regard to the first example, was punishment delivered to Johnny for hitting\nhis sister? You might say \u201cyes,\u201d but others may question whether being sent to bed\nfor hitting one\u2019s sister really constitutes punishment. Their response might be along\nthe following line: \u201cGoing to bed is a punishment for not eating your vegetables. It\u2019s\nnot adequate for a child who hits his sister? You have to teach him a lesson.\nSomething far worse should be done, like taking away TV time for a week. But only\none night of punishment? This is not right.\u201d\nAs you can see, being sent to bed would not, in the eyes of some, constitute an\nappropriate consequence for hitting one\u2019s sister, particularly if the incident caused\ninjury. Who is right? Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so too is punishment\nwhen using a procedural definition. What is harsh to one person is mild to another.\nNote that in the above examples, the effect on the child\u2019s behavior is not\nspecified. I believe this to be a huge and common mistake in discussions of\npunishment and one that leads to the widespread misunderstanding of punishment.\nWhy is it important to specify what the effect on behavior is? Let\u2019s use the third\nexample above to illustrate the ambiguity one faces when using the procedural (but\nhighly subjective) approach to defining punishment. When Raul hits his mother, he\nwill get spanked. Raul engages in this undesirable behavior and the presumed harsh\n(aversive) consequence is applied, i.e., spanking. Let us imagine that this harsh\nconsequence is not effective. In other words, Raul still hits his mother when he is mad\nat her for not letting him watch TV. What are we to conclude? Punishment does not\nwork for Raul? As his mother might utter, \u201cRaul is beyond that of normal mortals,\nhe is unaffected by punishment.\u201d If a child is not fazed by punishment, what can\npossibly help? \u201cProbably only some miracle behavior drug that has yet to be\ndiscovered,\u201d mutters Raul\u2019s mother.\nThe pitfall with the procedural definition is that it attempts to account for the\nsuccess or failure of punishment on the basis of a given application. If some\nconsequence, which appears to be so aversive that it should affect child behavior,\ndoes not work, punishment itself is determined to be ineffective.\nConcluding that punishment, as a general method of discipline, does not work\nleads to other more disastrous fall out. When parents or adults conclude this, they\noften do one of two things. First, they may claim that punishment does not work for\ntheir particular child. If punishment does not work, what else can be done for their\nchild? \u201cNo sense trying something else along the same lines,\u201d is the faulty reasoning\nhere. The unfortunate by-product of this conclusion is giving up on the effort to\nchange behavior via consequences. They justify this conclusion by explaining the 19\nexistence of behavior in terms of an unalterable condition, a condition inherent in\nthe child\u2019s biology. I have often heard the following as an explanation for the failure\nof a consequence to change behavior: \u201cWell, you know Johnny is just Johnny. He\ndoes this because he is just being Johnny.\u201d Translation: Since punishment does not\nwork, it is in Johnny\u2019s nature to do what he does and nothing is going to change that!\nAlternatively, the adult may conclude that not enough punishment (meaning\nmagnitude or amount) was administered. This can be potentially more dangerous in\nthe hands of novices than simply giving up. Their solution is to alter the intensity\nor duration of the consequent event. If you were spanking him once for hitting you,\nmaybe you should spank him twice, or thrice. Maybe you should pull his pants down\nso he will really feel it.\nAs you can readily see this is a slippery slope. Many an abusive situation was\nunintentionally rendered in the search for a really, really harsh consequence, to effect\na change in behavior. In the 1970s some children and adults living in institutions\nwere sent to time-out: for two to three days in a box, with minimal food and water.\nThe thought there must have been, if 2 hour time-outs were ineffective, maybe three\ndays will do the trick. Failing to understand what constitutes punishment and how\nit works, I believe, is in large part, responsible for such abusive practices.\nPunishment is Outcome-oriented\nConcluding nothing can work, or escalating consequences to unsafe levels, can\nbe the downfall of a procedural definition. Such results are less likely when an\n\u201coutcome-oriented definition\u201d (Grusec & Walters, 1977) is used. In an outcome-\noriented definition, a procedural contingency (i.e., temporal relationship between\nbehavior and a consequence) is still existent. However, an additional requirement is\nthat the effect of this contingency on the behavior is one of decrease. Punishment\nas a phenomenon exists when a procedural (behavioral) contingency produces a\ndecrease in the level of the target behavior. If one is interested in decreasing a\nbehavior, punishment always works!\nWith outcome-oriented punishment, there is no need to judge the harshness of\nthe consequence. If Johnny gets sent to bed early when he hits his sister, and he stops\nhitting his sister as a function of that consequence, then punishment exists. One\ncannot judge the presence of punishment simply by examining the consequence.\nRather one must know what behavioral effect resulted when such a contingency was\nput in place. This use of the term punishment leads to some interesting corollaries.\nFirst, punishment does not necessarily equate with the most severe forms of\nconsequences. Punishment can occur with a consequence that certainly does not\nevoke physical pain in the individual (as this book will make abundantly evident).\nOne need not be concerned about a subjective appraisal of the intended conse-\nquence. Rather one should be concerned with the resultant effect. This definition\nstipulates an outcome-oriented requirement.\nSecond, to equate the term punishment, with spankings, paddling, or any other\nform of corporal punishment is incorrect. In the previous example, if spanking\nproduces a decrease in Raul hitting his mother, then punishment occurred. 20 Section I\nSpanking is a punisher in this situation. Spanking may not have the same effect with\nanother child, or in another context. Further, one should not equate having a\n\u201ctough\u201d discipline practice with being effective. Mr. Felser, in the real life scenario\ndepicted below, probably thought he practiced tough discipline when he paddled\nstudents in junior high for \u201cbreaking the silence.\u201d I can personally attest to his\ntoughness. But was he effective?\nWhat Really Happened in the \u201cGood Ole Days?\u201d\nIn 1965, I was in seventh grade in a brand new junior high school, in\nLake Ronkonkoma, New York. The wrestling coach, who also was the\nindustrial arts teacher, was in charge of the cafeteria during my lunch\nperiod. I would guess there were several hundred students who ate lunch at\neach shift. Prior to each lunch shift being dismissed to go back to classes,\nMr. Felser (not his real name) would signal the students, via microphone,\nthat \u201cquiet time\u201d had ensued. During quiet time, students were to sit\nquietly, put their tray up, and not utter a peep to their neighbor.\nThe consequence for being caught talking during quiet time were a\nfunction of one\u2019s previous number of infractions. The first time you were\ncaught, Mr. Felser broadcast your infraction to everyone: \u201cMr. Sundin,\nplease stand. You have just been awarded cleaning duty.\u201d You then were\nassigned to clean up the cafeteria. With your second incident, you received\nthe above consequence as well as a scheduled spanking with a paddle\n(actually you could choose either a paddling or a detention). The third time\nyou got all three.\nWhen quiet time was signaled, the cafeteria became noticeably quiet.\nThis obviously made it easier for Mr. Felser to identify the guilty parties.\nThere were a few people who talked on occasion, including yours truly. The\nfirst time I got caught by Mr. Felser I picked up paper around the cafeteria\nalong with a few other select individuals. The second time, I picked up paper\nand also scheduled a paddling for later that day. Mr. Felser knew me because\nI was in his industrial arts class. On that day, upon command (i.e., \u201cMr.\nCipani, assume the position\u201d), I got ready. Mr. Felser remarked, \u201cWell Mr.\nCipani, you are fortunate today, my wrist is a little weak.\u201d (thinking to\nmyself: well, please by all means hit me while you are weak. In fact, if you want to\ntry to paddle me with just your pincer grasp around the paddle, I am all for\ninnovation in discipline techniques Mr. Felser) The blow came and it pushed me\nforward. Boy was I glad he was a little weak. I would have hated to catch him\nwhen he had his Wheaties for breakfast! No marks were left, but the hit was\nso hard that it jerked several tears from my eyes immediately upon contact.\nI went back to the next period. I was never called again for a violation of\nquiet time for the remainder of the year. Once was enough for me. 21\nHowever, what was apparent to me at that time (and not having taken\none psychology class) was that there was a small but distinct group of 7th and\n8th grade boys who were called out constantly. I can remember the name of\none of them, Mr. Leonard Tortelloni (not his real name). It seemed like it\nwas every other day that Leonard was talking or doing something to gain\nthe attention of Mr. Felser. One of his more devious ploys was to dump the\ncontents of his tray, before it reached the disposal area (i.e., food and plates\nlanded on the floor). What was also apparent to everyone was that Leonard\ndid not try to violate the rule in a stealth fashion. He actually looked like\nhe wanted to get caught. Was he not playing with a full deck?\nBased on my personal experience, I wondered how he could handle\nsuch a paddling on a multiple time per week basis. Leonard had long hair\nand wore extremely tight pants, which was the style back then. I also knew\nthat he and several of his fellow quiet time violators were quite popular with\nthe girls. Do you see why Leonard and his band of brothers acted they way\nthey did? They weighed physical pain versus later pleasure. I choose lack of\npain and lack of pleasure. The \u201cbad\u201d boys saw this as a mark of honor, and\nthey were lining up in droves for the paddling, and subsequently collecting\nphone numbers right after receiving their \u201cpunishment.\u201d I would also\nsurmise that calling Mr. Tortelloni by name in front of the entire lunch shift\nwas not a wise move either, on the part of Mr. Felser.\n\u2022 Why was spanking not an effective punisher for Mr. Tortelloni?\n\u2022 What could have been done to affect the behavior of Mr. Tortelloni?\nWhile I had to experience the consequence only once to be a believer in quiet\ntime, such a contingency only spurned Mr. Tortelloni to greater heights of mischief.\nDespite what you might have previously thought about paddling as being synony-\nmous with punishment, in the case of Mr. Tortelloni and his friends, it was not. Of\ncourse, if an outcome-oriented definition is used, one would see that paddling Mr.\nTortelloni is not punishment.\nThe outcome-oriented definition of punishment (Grusec & Walters, 1977) is\nthe definition I will use for the remainder of the book. Punishment depends on the\noutcome of the contingency. If the procedural contingency produces a decrement\nin the behavior that is targeted, then punishment occurred. If does not, then\npunishment did not occur, irrespective of the noxious nature of the consequence.\nPerhaps this example can make the distinction even clearer. If I asked you, \u201cIs\nhaving a teacher hug a student a reinforcer or a punisher,\u201d many of you would\nemphatically state it is a reinforcer. Forgive me for putting words in your mouth, but\nyour rationale for such an evaluation is most likely that hugs are an inherent sign of\ncare and affection and therefore, should be considered a reinforcer. You probably\ncan\u2019t see where getting a hug could be aversive, could you? But using the outcome- 22 Section I\noriented definition, if a teacher hugs a child each time she says the correct answer to\na problem and as a result the rate of correct answers decreases, we have punishment!\nI am sure you could now figure out some scenarios where hugging could result in the\nbehavior it produces becoming less frequent. If you doubt this, start frequently\nhugging your teenager in front of his or her friends for some set of behaviors and\nwatch those behaviors disappear from their repertoire! Now there is a discipline\nstrategy I bet you never thought of before reading this book!\nIn the example offered in the introduction, what was the consequence for a\nchild\u2019s aggressive behavior? If a child threw another child off the bike, he or she lost\nthe opportunity to ride the bike for the remainder of the free play, as well as receiving\na short time-out. Was the contingency (i.e., loss of bike time) a punisher? The answer,\nmost definitely, is \u201cYes.\u201d Aggression was reduced when such a contingency was put\nin effect. Note that no physically painful event was needed to effect punishment of\naggressive behavior in this case. It simply required the loss of the opportunity to ride\nthe bike, contingent on aggression.\nThe outcome-oriented definition of punishment also leads to an important\ndistinction. As a behavior analyst, I view punishment as something that occurs to a\nbehavior. Contrast this with the common conception of punishment, i.e., you\npunish the person. This is a significant distinction. When I use punishment I desire\nto decrease a behavior by producing an effective behavioral contingency that alters\nthat behavior. What is the objective when you punish a person? What behavior or\nbehaviors do you intend to alter? Or is altering a behavior a concern at all? As a side\nnote, the same mistake is often heard in reference to reinforcement (i.e., reinforce\na person). If you hear someone claim they reinforce the child, tell them that people\ncannot get reinforced. How does one increase a person? Rather, a behavior is\nreinforced (i.e., strengthened in future probability). That should make you popular\nat your next social function! Exposing Myths About Punishment 23\nSection II:\nExposing Myths About Punishment\nMany attributions have been made over the years about punishment. State-\nments such as, \u201cpunishment does not work,\u201d or \u201cpunishment only serves to express\nanger on the part of the parent,\u201d have been cited frequently. These statements are\ntaken as fact, without asking for substantiation of such claims.\nFor example, a speaker at a professional conference denounces the use of\npunishment as a tactic that does not work. Many people applaud, and cite the\npresentation as evidence that punishment does not work. This speaker\u2019s statement\nis taken as fact, not personal opinion. But where is the scientific evidence that\ndemonstrates punishment procedures have been reliable failures in changing child\nbehavior? On the contrary, many studies that I will present in this book provide\nevidence that punishment procedures are effective in changing a wide variety of\nbehaviors. Many experts, however, have told us that it does not work. Who is one\nto believe?\nNow suppose that same speaker said, \u201cI have looked at your hand and it is blue!\u201d\nYou would not believe this statement because the evidence is staring you in the face.\nYour hand is not blue. In this situation you would weigh the evidence for and against\nthe validity of the statement and conclude that it is not believable. Weighing the\nevidence, and the credibility of such evidence, is the key to detecting what is fact, from\nwhat is opinion.\nI want to stress this point vociferously. Across all contentions made in defense\nof or in opposition to punishment, you should apply that \u201cweighing the evidence\u201d\nprocess. You should apply this level of scrutiny regardless of how many Ph.D.\u2019s the\nspeaker or author has behind his or her name. Parents and professionals need to\ndiscern which statements are based on research and which ones are based on either\nanecdotal tales, someone\u2019s perceptions about reality, or philosophical/moral posi-\ntions. Evidence is evidence and opinion is opinion. Opinion does not equal\nscientific fact, regardless of the number of books someone has written. Too often,\nin the field of human behavior, opinion and perception have been disguised and\nparaded as fact.\nIn a book entitled, Punishment and its Alternatives, Drs. Johnny Matson and\nThomas DiLorenzo reported that few well-controlled studies examining the effects\nand side effects of punishment have been conducted (Matson & DiLorenzo, 1984).\nThis statement is just as true today as it was in 1984 (Lerman & Vorndan, 2002).\nUnfortunately, the prohibition against conducting basic animal research on punish-\nment effects further impedes the acquisition of scientific data (Dinsmoor, 1998).\nWhy is this lack of research examining punishment bad?\nLack of research leads to speculation. Speculation leads to the advent of myths\nand beliefs about behavioral effects of punishment. Over time, myths take on a level 24 Section II\nof believability as quasi-evidence. The erosion of factual evidence makes the myths\nappear to have a basis in fact. Such appears to be the case with many of the lay and\nprofessional writings on punishment and its effects.\nThere are several misconceptions that are frequently made about punishment\nand the use of it to produce child behavior change. Unfortunately, these commonly\ncited misconceptions have had a deleterious effect on the responsible use of\npunishment in situations where it may be warranted. Further it has had a stifling\neffect on applied research. For these reasons, such myths need to be exposed. The\nfollowing five myths about punishment, I believe, have resulted in a misuse, lack of\nuse and/or abuse of punishment:\n\u2022 Myth #1: Punishment Does Not Work\n(cid:127) Myth #2: Punishment Temporarily Suppresses Behavior\n(And Therefore Is Not Worth the Effort)\n(cid:127) Myth #3: Punishment Causes Problems for a Child\u2019s\nEmotional Development\n(cid:127) Myth #4: Punishment Is Not as Effective as Reinforcement\n(cid:127) Myth #5: Time-out Does Not Work\nMyth #1: Punishment Does Not Work\nWhy is this a Myth?\nThis statement is a myth for two basic reasons: (1) definition and (2) available\nscientific studies demonstrating effectiveness. First, by definition, outcome-oriented\npunishment always works, as was made evident in the previous section. Yet, how\nmany times have you heard some parent, teacher or professional profess the\nfollowing: \u201cI have used time-out and it did not work. Time-out is a punishment\ntechnique. Therefore punishment does not always work. With some kids it might\nwork. With others, it does not work.\u201d\nI do not dispute that the use of time-out may not have been effective in the above\nsituation(s). What is a technically correct conclusion is the following: Time-out did\nnot function as a punisher, in this circumstance, for unknown reasons. Similarly,\nmany people who have \u201cgrounded\u201d their child may not have had success in changing\ntheir child\u2019s behavior. In these cases, grounding did not function as a punisher. As\nI would constantly tell my students, there are no inherent punishing events for\neveryone and every instance. In both these fictitious examples, one does not have\noutcome-oriented punishment. Rather, one has illustrated procedural punishment.\nThe second reason why this statement is a myth is that the applied clinical\nresearch data are overwhelming and compelling. There have been numerous\nresearch studies that have demonstrated that punishment can be effected by\ncontingent applications of certain events and consequences. Further, such research\nis over a large range of behaviors with a wide diversity of children. Exposing Myths About Punishment 25\nClaiming punishment does not work is akin to claiming airplanes cannot fly.\nSure there are times when planes unfortunately crash. No one jumps up and says,\n\u201cHey those people who founded the principles of aerodynamics are wrong. See what\nhappened to this plane.\u201d Anyone who claims that punishment does not work is\neither unaware of the numerous studies that have demonstrated the efficacy of\npunishment or chooses to ignore them. Showing anecdotal situations where a\ncertain consequence (e.g., time-out) is ineffective, do not constitute \u201coverwhelming\u201d\nempirical evidence that a technique does not work. This is particularly true when the\ndeployment of the technique is of an unknown entity. Perhaps it is the carpenter,\nnot the tool, who is at fault!\nHow a plan is designed and implemented makes a big difference in its potential\nsuccess. All carpenters are not equally competent. The following example illustrates\nwhy the specifics of a plan to change child behavior and a consistent follow-through\nare crucial in determining if some strategy will work.\nIt Will Never Work With These Kids!\nIn the early 1980s, I was involved as a behavioral consultant with a\nprogram for children with severe problem behaviors. These children were\nusually removed from the public school setting as a result of unmanageable\nbehaviors. They were placed in a residential facility, where they lived and\nwent to a school on the grounds of that facility (just for children with such\nproblems). One of the teachers I had worked with mentioned a unique\nproblem to me. She had a small class of young boys. She was concerned\nabout the amount of food waste occurring during lunchtime. She said the\nchildren would often throw away more than half of their food. The\nteacher\u2019s perception was that the children were only eating the dessert and\nsome portion of the other food. This occurred despite the fact the children\nwere able to take as much or as little as they desired, in a cafeteria-style lunch.\nWhen I proposed that we design a behavior plan to address this problem,\nthe teacher was skeptical. \u201cIt probably won\u2019t work for these kids. They are\npicky eaters by nature.\u201d But she agreed to give it a try.\nWe implemented a system to start measuring whether plate waste\noccurred for each student during the lunch period, so that consequences\ncould be brought to bear (Lau & Cipani, 1984). Each child was to select a\nportion of vegetables and the main dish, at whatever amount he desired (as\nhad been the case before). However, before he emptied the tray, the student\nwas to show the teacher his plate. If it had food on it, the student did not\nearn points unless he went back and finished it. The points were to be traded\nin later for time on preferred activities. If the student had finished his food,\nthen he earned three points for that effort.\nWas the loss of not earning three points enough to change their\nwasteful eating habits, when other attempts had failed? Again remember, 26 Section II\nthey only had to eat the amount, however small, of food they put on their\nplate. Waste was the issue. The use of such a consequence for food waste\nwas implemented before and after a several week stretch where no conse-\nquences were deployed, to determine if consequences were effective. The\nresults are depicted in the chart below for five male students. The percent-\nage of food waste for the main dish is depicted as a function of the use of\nthe consequence described above (see both columns marked Ind. Conseq.)\nversus the lack of such a consequence (column marked No Conseq.).\nStudent Ind. Conseq. No Conseq. Ind. Conseq.\nJack 20 44 Notpresent\nK.K. 0 20 0\nK.M. 20 40 0\nVince 40 56 11\nWally 0 70 20\nLook at Vince\u2019s data. He went from 56% of the lunches having food\nthrown away, to 11% (last column) when he would not earn points when\nhe wasted food. Wally\u2019s data is equally impressive. When contingencies are\nin effect, his average rate of food waste is zero and 20% respectively. Look\nwhat happens when the only consequence was probably slight embarrass-\nment (middle column). His food waste percentage goes to 70%. A similar\nfinding for the effectiveness of consequences was obtained for the student\u2019s\nconsumption of vegetables. Does somebody want to explain how this is an\nexample of an ineffective procedure?\nWhat is more impressive is to consider the context under which these\nresults were obtained. Consider this anecdotal evidence. Several classes ate\nlunch during this time period. Only this teacher\u2019s class was using a\nconsequence for wasting food. On my observations during the study, it was\nreadily evident that students from other classes were wasting food, throwing\nlarge portions of their lunch in the trash bins. Don\u2019t we hear, on a regular\nbasis, that children are influenced by their peers? Is it not an undisputed fact\nthat children pick up bad behaviors from their peers?\nFor all of the talk about kids modeling each other\u2019s behavior, the results\nof this study may demonstrate the power of consequences over modeling\neffects. At the time of the study, it was not possible to set up a system for\nall children in the lunchroom at that time to not waste food. Nor did the\nother teachers appear to be interested in making food waste an issue.\nHowever, in spite of the fact that there was \u201cnegative\u201d modeling of food\nwaste, the students in this study wanted to earn points more than imitate Exposing Myths About Punishment 27\ntheir peers. Can consequences for behavior override negative peer influ-\nences? Examine this study and consider that possibility. Here is further\nfood for thought. What are the implications for parents regarding their\nchildren\u2019s watching of violent TV or video programs and its supposed\nstimulus for aggression? Is it \u201cautomatic\u201d that children will imitate what\nthey see?\n\u2022 What effect did the point contingency have on the food waste of the\ntarget students?\n\u2022 Why were students not in this class unaffected by this point system?\n\u2022 Do you think food waste is a problem at other schools?\nDoes Punishment Always Work?\nPerhaps this seems like an indefensible statement if one conjures up a specific\npunishing event and attempts to explain how it would work all the time. I am not\nsaying that spanking, or time-out, nor loss of special privileges, or other forms of\nconsequences for child misbehavior always works. If we go back to the outcome-\noriented definition of punishment that I am using, then by definition, punishment\nalways works (to decrease a behavior). Certain applications of consequent strategies\ndo not work under certain conditions. If one utilizes this definition of punishment,\nthan certain applications may not work, hence punishment did not take place.\nPerhaps a hypothetical example can make this distinction more clear.\nLet us say Betty decided to remove 10 cents (a fine) from her 14-year-old son\u2019s\nallowance for each chore he does not perform over the course of a week. She feels\nthis will \u201cpunish him\u201d for being lazy. (Note to reader: remember the first tip is to\nunderstand that one punishes behavior, not people, in outcome-oriented punishment.) His\nallowance is $8 for a week. His chores are raking the leaves in the front yard, emptying\nthe house garbage cans in the dumpster twice a week, and cleaning his room on\nFriday. Her son rarely completes these chores. Betty pleads with him, threatens him,\nand then sends him to his room if she is really upset with him. When that does not\nwork she proclaims that he takes after his father\u2019s side of the family, and his laziness\nis probably genetic! Hence, Betty has a strong desire to try something that will\nsucceed in getting her son to complete his chores around the house.\nFor a 2-week period prior to the fining system for chores, Betty charted her son\u2019s\ncompletion of these chores. She told him, \u201cNow I am going to be writing down\nwhether or not you do your assigned chores or not. You better get on the stick.\u201d Her\nson was apparently unimpressed by having a permanent recording of his lack of\nperformance posted on the wall. He continued in his old ways. He did not rake the\nleaves either week, he did not empty the garbage cans at all (four opportunities) and\nhe did not clean his room. Again, this confirmed in Betty\u2019s mind that her son really\nis lazy. She remarked to herself, \u201cWhat is it with 14-year-olds these days? They just\ndon\u2019t care.\u201d 28 Section II\nFollowing this 2-week recording period, Betty implemented the fining strategy\nfor 3 consecutive weeks. Did this undo her son\u2019s genetic defect? The results were not\nimpressive. His lack of attending to the chores resulted in fines for each chore, save\none time when he took out the garbage in the first week. Betty concludes that her\nson does not respond to punishment. She remarks, \u201cThis proves that his father\u2019s\ngenes are responsible for his laziness since he does not even care if he loses money.\nHow can you be that lazy? Just like his father.\u201d\nObviously her strategy did not work, but is she wrong in concluding that\npunishment does not work for her son? The answer should be obvious. The correct\nconclusion from this hypothetical case is that removing 10 cents from her son for\nevery uncompleted chore was a strategy that was an unfortunate failure. However,\nwould the results have been the same thing if we \u201cupped the ante\u201d to maybe $1 for\neach uncompleted chore? What about loss of a dollar and loss of half an hour of TV\ntime on the weekend for each uncompleted chore? Betty currently does not have an\neffective punisher in place for her son\u2019s chores, but the night is young! If she\nunderstands that punishment is defined in terms of its outcome, she might possibly\nrefine the plan. She may increase the fine for chores or add other components to the\nplan to change her son\u2019s rate of completing chores.\nSo, by definition, outcome-oriented punishment always works. To determine\nwhether punishment has occurred one looks after the fact. If the target child\nmisbehavior was reduced as a result of the consequence, punishment occurred (up\nto that point). If the behavior did not become less probable, punishment did not\noccur.\nWhat is the Utility of this Outcome-based Approach?\nObviously, we can all make better decisions about things after they have\noccurred. So, what good does this outcome-based approach have for real life? This\nis a good question and I have a good answer. My answer brings me back to my earlier\nuniversity teaching days. The graduate students in my classes in the 1980s would\noften question an outcome-based definition as having any real life utility. When\nstudents would question the usefulness of such a definition, I would say, \u201cIf you see\nit this way, you will always hunt for a better mousetrap and not accept a defeatist\nattitude toward changing child behavior. To try something and conclude, \u201cWell that\ndid not work, I guess it is not meant to be,\u201d is all too common. However, if you\nunderstand that this specific application did not work, but altering the consequence\nin some fashion may produce results, you will persevere where others have already\ngiven up.\nLet\u2019s take Betty\u2019s case again. If she concludes that punishment does not work,\nshe stops the fine system. She then becomes even more depressed about her fate of\nhaving married someone who is passing on these bad genes. This is often accompa-\nnied by no intervention at all for some period of time, further perpetuating her\nfeelings of helplessness. However, if she reasons that this one application did not\nwork as intended, but knows that some other consequence may succeed, she Exposing Myths About Punishment 29\nproceeds to re-design her strategy for dealing with this behavior. She attempts to\nbuild a better mousetrap!\nBetty might first try to increase the fine, as the current fining system only results\nin a loss of 40 cents a week if her son does absolutely nothing. Her son probably does\nnot see such a consequence as a big deal, because he would still have $9.60 each week.\nThat is too much profit for someone who does absolutely nothing. She also decides\nto focus just on room cleaning for now and become a little more exacting in the\ndeadline for her son to clean his room. If his room is not clean by Thursday at 8:00\nP.M., then he does not get to go out with his friends Friday afternoon after school,\nin addition to a heftier fine ($5 for an unclean room). Betty also spends time with\nhim two Thursdays in a row teaching him what a clean room is. With these changes,\nBetty hits pay dirt. Her son cleans his room for the first 3 weeks of the program.\nI would say that Betty has definitely made an impression on her \u201cgenetically\ndefective\u201d son. Armed with her understanding of how to use punishment and other\nprocedures effectively, she can now tackle the other two chores in a similar fashion.\nHer son has demonstrated that he does take notice of a substantially larger fine,\ncombined with possible loss of time with friends.\nWhat Do You Call a Severe Consequence that Does Not Work as a\nPunisher?\nAn aversive situation for everyone involved! What is apparent is that outcome-\noriented punishment does not exist. If a child is constantly subjected to time-out, in\nthe range of 8-15 times per day, month after month, I would conjecture that no one\nis satisfied. It is certainly not in the child\u2019s best interests to be spending that much\ntime away from pleasant activities. I am also certain that the parent is unhappy about\nhaving to engage in the time-out scenario that many times a day. If the number of\ntime-outs is not reduced over time, as a result of a marked decrease in the child\u2019s target\nbehavior, something is wrong in Cocoa Beach! Perhaps it is the random application\nof such a consequence for many behaviors. Therefore, an inevitable contingency\ndoes not exist. Or it could be that some of the other parameters of punishment are\nmissing, such as the removal of a competing reinforcement contingency (see Section\nIII for details). Lack of adherence to any of the basic principles delineated in Section\nIII could be the culprit. But what we do know is that punishment is not operable,\nit is just an unpleasant situation for everyone.\nWhy is this Myth Perpetuated?\nTwo primary reasons: (1) poor applications of consequences that are incorrectly\ntermed punishment, and (2) quasi-research. Let me start by explaining what I mean\nby poor applications of consequences. The use of positive reinforcement and\npunishment procedures to solve problems with children\u2019s behavior in schools and\nhome settings began appearing in the professional literature in the 1960s. There were\nmany studies demonstrating the utility of behavioral procedures to increase appro-\npriate behavior and decrease disruptive behavior. The conduct of these studies was\ncarefully controlled, in particular, the implementation of the treatment regimen. If 30 Section II\nthe study was testing the efficacy of a point system on reducing tardiness in a class,\nthen the contingent relationship between being tardy and losing points was assured.\nThe implementation of the treatment regimen was strictly adhered to, often with\nextensive help from graduate and undergraduate \u201cvolunteers.\u201d One must realize that\nin the research literature, published studies were conducted with precision. The\nnumerous validation studies that accumulated were demonstrations of model\nimplementation. The treatment strategy was conducted like clockwork, and sloppi-\nness was not an option.\nBut what would happen if the persons conducting these studies were sloppy in\ntheir implementation of the treatment procedures? What if instead of losing points\nevery time a student was late, we had a smorgasbord of consequences that could be\nused? Sometimes five points would be deducted from the student\u2019s point total.\nOther times, if the teacher felt the student did not intend to be late, only 2 points\nwould be deducted. Still, with other tardy instances, the teacher might feel\ncompelled to give the student a lecture about the need to be punctual to class. If the\nstudent promises to \u201cstraighten up and fly right from here on in,\u201d the teacher lets the\nstudent off with a warning. Do you see where we are headed? Right to the child\ndiscipline strategies of many adults, who then claim that fining a child for\nmisbehavior does not work! Again, they blame the tools. The tools, however, are fine\nin the right hands. It is the particular carpenter who is misusing the tools and needs\nfurther training on how to use these tools effectively. Below is an example of this\nsmorgasbord approach to consequences.\nParent: Dr. Cipani. We have tried everything. Our daughter continues to\nthrow tantrums when she does not get her way.\nTherapist: I can see you are frustrated over this situation. Let me get an idea\nof some of the strategies you have tried. Give me some examples of\nyour strategies in dealing with her tantrums.\nParent: We have used time-out, reasoning, prodding, warning, ignoring,\npleading, and even spanking her. We have also sent her to counseling\nfor a 7-month period, hoping that will help her. She does not realize\nthat she cannot have everything she wants. (Note to reader: Why would\nyou think she continues in this manner. Might it be that tantrum behaviors\neventually produce something from the parents? Hmm?)\nTherapist: Tell me more about time-out. Have you used it within the last\ntwo weeks?\nParent: Yes.\nTherapist: What does she do when she has a tantrum? Exposing Myths About Punishment 31\nParent: She cries, whines, says hateful things and is generally \u201cuncouth.\u201d If\nshe wants a candy bar, and I don\u2019t give it to her, she will cry and say she\ndoes not love me, because I am mean.\nTherapist: That does sound hurtful. Being a parent myself, hearing that has\ngot to hurt to some extent. I know it must be hard to ignore that.\nParent: It sure does hurt. She knows that too. At some point in time she\nshows that she is sorry for what she said. When she does apologize for\nher remarks, which is quite often the case, I promise her candy later,\nfor being sensitive.\nTherapist: (What did I just finish thinking? Throw a tantrum, say hurtful things,\napologize and voila! Candy.) That is interesting. (I need to see whether she\nsticks to the time-out for each incident or applies it at whim.) Let\u2019s slightly\nchange direction for just a minute. How many times have you put her\nin time-out for the last two weeks?\nParent: I would say no more than five times. I try not to use it if I don\u2019t have\nto.\nTherapist: (That does not sound good.) How many tantrums would you say she\nhas had in the last 2 weeks?\nParent: Countless.\nTherapist: Would you say more than 20?\nParent: Easily.\nYou can see that the efficacy of time-out in reducing this girl\u2019s tantrum behavior\nhas not really been tested. Time-out occurs in only a small proportion of the tantrum\nincidents. What has been tested is a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Maybe\nEmeril can make Beef Stroganoff perfectly by trusting his judgment, but I would sure\nfeel more comfortable when less trained cooks follow a recipe. It is important to\nrealize that many judgments about punishment and reinforcement are from recipes\nof unknown entities, with people who have not had formal cooking lessons.\nBut there is a second factor that I believe maintains this myth about punish-\nment. This second factor is what I call quasi-research. Much of quasi-research, which\nextols the horror of using punishment, comes from investigations that use parent\ninterview as the primary or main source of the data collection. From this, conclusions\nabout real life behavior are made. For example, one of the earliest research studies\non children and parents was compiled in a book published in 1957 (Sears, Maccoby, 32 Section II\n& Levin, 1957). The authors developed extensive interview procedures, asking\nmothers questions about their child and their parental methods of dealing with their\nchild. Their study included hundreds of mothers being interviewed. This gives\npeople the impression that their conclusions have to be right because so many\nsubjects were part of the data collection effort. Their study attempted to find\ncorrelates between what the mothers reported they did with their children and the\nmothers\u2019 report about how their children behaved.\nIn one of their chapters on children\u2019s conscience, they conclude that higher\nlevels of conscience in children are associated with love-oriented techniques (e.g., use\nof praise, reasoning, etc.). In contrast, lower levels of conscience development in\nchildren are associated with more materialistic parenting techniques. These tech-\nniques are the use of rewards, loss of privileges, and use of physical punishment. You\ncan see where the dilemma is created. Many of the behavior analysis studies cited in\nthis book reveal such parental contingencies work well in reducing target problem\nbehaviors. The data cited in the behavior analysis studies resulted from an indepen-\ndent observer, who counted the frequency of the child\u2019s behavior. Hence, bias and\nperception were reduced to a minimum.\nWhich Studies Should Be Used to Judge the Efficacy of Punishment?\nUnlike the parenting research by Sears and colleagues (Sears et al., 1957), the\nbehavior analysis studies did not ask the parents how they thought the procedure\nmight or did work, but rather they put it to the test. This is referred to as an\nexperimental analysis of behavior. Of utmost importance, these studies allowed the\nresearchers to make conclusions about what really works, instead of speculating\nabout what works. For example, in our previously cited study (Lau & Cipani, 1984),\nthe use of the fine system produced lower levels of food waste in students during\nlunchtime. In contrast, removing the punishment contingency resulted in food\nwaste reaching heightened levels. We demonstrated a causal relationship between\ncontingencies (or lack thereof) and the amount of child food waste.\nAccording to the Sears interview data, we should not have achieved our\nsuccessful results in reducing food waste! Use of a materialistic intervention, such as\npoints backed up by tangible items, should not result in improvements in child\nbehavior. According to Sears and colleagues, only love-oriented techniques are\nfound to be correlated with better child behavior.\nThe conclusion you should draw\u2014 not all research studies are created equal. An\nexperimental analysis allows researchers and readers of the research to conclude\ncause and effect. When you test the efficacy of a procedure against its absence and\nshow that the level of misbehavior is a function of whether the procedure is in effect\n(or not), you have demonstrated causality. On the other hand, correlating how\nparents report they have raised their children with the child\u2019s level of behavior does\nnot. Now you have a basis for believing one set of research findings over the other.\nThe behavior analysis findings are more credible because of their analysis of cause\nand effect. Exposing Myths About Punishment 33\nI have another problem with this type of correlation research. Asking people\nwhether they think punishment worked or did not work for them when they were\nchildren is no way to build a base of knowledge. A science of human behavior requires\nmore than a Gallup Poll approach to posing questions about people\u2019s perceptions of effective-\nness. One does not determine the composition of the moon\u2019s atmosphere by\nsampling the public on their thoughts and perceptions about the moon.\nHere is an illustration of the fallacy of correlation studies concluding causal\nrelationships. Suppose a research study shows that children who eat peanut butter\nalso have a greater tendency to wear fancier shoes. Common sense, would dictate\nthat we not draw the inference that eating peanut butter causes children to dress\nbetter in terms of their shoe apparel, or vice versa. Showing that two things are\nassociated does not mean they cause one another. No matter how tempting it is to\ninvoke causality, you cannot! This is usually a principle taught in an introductory\npsychology class, but apparently forgotten by some of the people who pursue\nadvanced degrees. Now that you have this distinction, in which body of research are\nyou going to put more credence?\nWhat Might Be an Alternative Explanation for the Sears et al. Data?\nLet\u2019s take for granted the accuracy of the self-report data, which I consider a huge\nleap in faith. Consider the following as a plausible conclusion. Children with high\nlevels of conscience can evoke more pleasing behaviors in the adults who care for\nthem. Concurrently, children who have high levels of misbehavior evoke lesser\namounts of praise from adults. Does that not fit with what we observe in the world\non a daily basis? If you had two teachers, one who frequently issued praise in her class\nand one who did not, what would you conclude? Is it possible that the rate of praise\nis a function of the students in the class? Do kids that follow instructions at a higher\nrate make it easier for teachers to provide them lots of praise? Is the opposite also\ntrue?\nIt is dangerous, in my opinion, to find an association between certain types of\nparental behavior and child behavior and assume that one causes the other. This is\nquasi-science; it looks like science, but it really has over stepped its limitations. This\ncan be dangerous and lead to statements that can cause people to believe something\nthat may be totally false.\nWhy is it Dangerous to Conclude Causality from Correlation\nResearch?\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, mothers of children with autism were wrongly accused\nof creating their child\u2019s disorder by a psychoanalytic psychiatrist, Dr. Bruno\nBettleheim (Bettleheim, 1967). He was quite well known, so his writings became\nwidely disseminated on the topic. He noticed that the mothers of these children were\ncold and aloof to their child\u2019s behavior, unlike mothers of other children. He\nconcluded that the mothers needed analytic therapy to help them overcome their\npersonality defects, claiming they had a syndrome he called \u201crefrigerator mothers.\u201d\nIn his eyes, and the eyes of many that used his writings as gospel, these mothers 34 Section II\ncaused their children to socially withdraw, not communicate and engage in\nstereotypic and ritualistic behavior. Bettleheim believed that if the mother would\njust be able to shed her refrigerator personality, the child would develop like other\nchildren, so he believed. Of course, the tragedy is that in addition to having a child\nwith severe deficits, these mothers also were now made to believe and feel that they\ncaused their child\u2019s disability. Shame, Shame!\nWe now know better. Having a child with autism creates an unusual circum-\nstance, one in which attachment behaviors on the part of the mother are not\nreciprocated. Children with autism are withdrawn and often do not show the usual\nattachment and bonding type responses to their mothers. Dr. Bettleheim had the\ncausal arrow going in the wrong direction. It wasn\u2019t the mothers who were causing\nthe child\u2019s behavior. Rather, it was most probably the child\u2019s lack of affectionate\nbehaviors that was a more plausible explanation of some mother\u2019s emotional\ndistance to their child. By the way, many fathers have an even more difficult time\nwith their autistic children, in my experience. I wonder why Dr. Bettleheim did not\nconsider the possibility of freezer fathers?\nWhat are Some Research Studies that have Experimentally Tested\nPunishment Procedures?\nMaking bus rides safe for everyone. What parent has not had difficulty with\nchildren during car trips? The noise level can sometimes be so elevated that car\naccidents become more likely. Now, consider that school bus drivers have usually\na much larger number of children as they traverse the roads. A survey in Leon\nCounty, Florida, in the late 1970s revealed the seriousness of this problem (Greene,\nBailey, & Barber, 1981). Twenty-five percent of the resignations of school bus drivers\nwere reported to be a direct function of the bus driver\u2019s inability to manage or tolerate\nschool bus disruptions. And you thought driving a school bus for a couple of hours\nis an easy job!\nThese researchers tested the efficacy of a unique punishing event (loss of music\nwhile riding the bus) on an extremely noisy afternoon bus route. The punisher,\nremoval of music, occurred for frequent bursts of disruptive noise on the school bus.\nIf the bus riders stayed below a certain number of incidents of disruptive noise on\na given trip, they could have preferred music played the following afternoon while\nriding home on the bus. However, if they went above a designated target level of\ndisruptive noise bursts, they lost the music on the following afternoon trip.\nIn order to accurately measure the decibel level of noise, an automated\nelectronic system was used. The researchers instituted a sound recording device\nabove the driver\u2019s head that could be adjusted so that when the noise in the bus\nreached a certain level, a light display, called Noise Gard, was activated. To insure\nthat bus noises, such as rumblings and the drone of the engine did not set it off, a\nfilter of 500Hz was set. A noise level at or below this would not register. The Noise\nGard gave the riders feedback each time the noise level went above the designated\ntarget. Additionally, it kept track of each reading above the allowed decibel level as\nwell as the length of time the noise level stayed above the criterion level. In this Exposing Myths About Punishment 35\nmanner, each instance of heightened noise levels could be accurately determined\nright at the point of occurrence, by a machine.\nThe results demonstrated that a group of noisy bus riders could be taught to keep\ntheir noise down to a reasonable level. The removal of preferred music during the\nbus ride, as a consequence for noisy behavior, did the trick. (Note to reader: This\nconsequence, removal of music, is well within the realm of possibility for parents with noisy kids\nduring short car trips.)\nRule-following behavior in classrooms. Students who were referred to a special\nsummer class by their teacher, principal, and school psychologist served as subjects\nfor a study by Azrin and Powers (1975). These students demonstrated extreme\ndisruptive behavior during the regular school year and grossly deficient academic\nskills. Could you imagine a class of students such as this? Take all the kids with severe\nproblem behavior across an entire school district, and put them in one class. The\nteacher of this class should get combat pay and free mental health services!\nHow bad was the disruptive behavior in this special classroom? The rate of\ndisruptions averaged 30 per child per day. Would informing these children of the\nrules do the trick? During the initial period of the study, the teacher repeated the rules\nfor the class with each disruption. For example, if a child talked without being called\nupon, the teacher would remark, \u201cDo not talk unless you are called upon.\u201d The\nteacher simply appealed to the child\u2019s sense of righteousness. Would that be enough\nto reduce disruptive behavior? Do pigs fly? Observing the class at that time revealed\nnumerous instances of children walking and running about, talking, hitting other\nstudents and generally creating a lack-of-learning environment. Repeating the rules\nwhen students violated them was unfortunately, ineffective.\nWhile it would be nice if the effective intervention for these children would be\ncomprised of simply pointing out their misbehaviors, such was not the case.\nHowever, consequences often work where other strategies fail. How about if the\nstudent is required, during recess, to recite the rule and practice the correct classroom\nbehaviors when she or he failed to follow the rules? Can anything help this teacher?\nThis consequence had a significant effect. The average level of disruptions per\nchild was now about two. Dr. Azrin noted that the classroom now resembled an\nenvironment of learning. Children for the most part were considerate to each other,\nonly left their seats with permission, and directed their attention to the learning\nactivity. None of the children were shouting or walking about. When a child did\nleave his or her seat without permission it clearly appeared to be out of forgetfulness,\nrather than a deliberate violation of the rules, as it was in the past. Yes, Virginia. There\nis a Santa Claus for teachers. It goes by the name of \u201cEffective Consequences.\u201d\nChild behavior during shopping trips. A study, conducted by Dr. Rusty Clark, at\nthe University of Kansas, had the following objective: to teach mothers how to\nmanage the behavior of their children during shopping trips (Clark, Greene,\nMacRae, McNees, Davis, & Risley, 1977). The mothers were taught a number of\nparenting behaviors in an advice package. They were taught to praise appropriate\nshopping behavior, keep the trips short in the beginning, and turn the shopping trip 36 Section II\ninto a learning experience. The contingency aspect of this advice was a fine system,\nA.K.A., response cost. The children were each given a certain amount of money prior\nto the trip, listed on an index card (e.g., $1). The index card would have ten, $0.10\nentries, thus equaling a dollar. The rules for the shopping trip were listed and\nreviewed each trip. For each violation, the mother merely stopped, pointed out the\ninfraction, and deducted a dime from the stipend. Whatever money was left on the\nchild\u2019s card could be spent on the next trip or saved. All parents participating in this\nstudy liked the advice package and found that it helped their children be more\nappropriate during trips. The results on disruptive behavior across all three families\nwere as expected (i.e., marked improvements). How to use this advice package is\ndetailed in my book (Cipani, 1999), Helping Parents Help their Kids: A Clinical Guide\nfor Six Child Problem Behaviors .\nImproving school attendance via fines. Response cost (A.K.A. fines) can also be\nused successfully in other areas where time-out is not feasible. How many schools\nhave problems with student attendance? Is student attendance amenable to response\ncost consequences? A study addressed that question with a resounding, \u201cYes\u201d\n(Alexander, Corbett, & Smigel, 1976). A residential facility served court ordered\nyouth who engaged in repeated charges of truancy, assault larceny, unmanageable\nbehavior, and probation violations. Seven of these students attended three local high\nschools. Baseline data revealed an attendance rate across all the classes in a 5-day\nperiod to be between 50-60% (a mean of 51%). Prior to the contingency, each\nstudent was given $1 for lunch, without any requirement on one\u2019s behavior. With\nthe response cost contingency, the dollar for lunch was the fine for missing one or\nmore class periods. A sack lunch would be provided to anyone who missed one class\nthe previous day, instead of the dollar for lunch. You might say, \u201cThe day of the free\ncafeteria lunch is over!\u201d With this change in policy, the average rate of attendance\nacross all classes for the seven students rose to 80%. The average rate of daily class\nattendance rose even higher to 94% when any of the seven students who missed a\nclass resulted in everyone missing a class, which is called a group contingency.\nThese researchers then tackled a second problem. They used a unique version\nof a response cost to curb coming back late from evening curfew in one of the female\nadolescent cottages. Prior to actual data collection, staff at the cottage reported\ncurfew violations from the eight girls residing in this cottage to be a nightly\noccurrence. The designated contingency plan involved the following response cost.\nComing home late resulted in a fine administered the following night in 15-minute\nincrements. For example, if a girl came in 8 minutes late, she would have curfew\nmoved up 15 minutes earlier the following night. If she came in 35 minutes late she\nwould have a 45-minute earlier curfew time. The best results of this response cost\nprocedure occurred with the following contingency. When everyone was respon-\nsible for coming home on time, lest all receive the appropriate amount of the fine,\ncurfew violations reached zero minutes across all girls for almost half of the nights\n(7/15 evenings of perfect compliance with curfew). Who wants to stay out late now? Exposing Myths About Punishment 37\nCan Parents Abuse Punishment?\nAnyone who watches TV can see that abusive practices occur, and are often\nequated with punishment. But it is wrong to equate abusive practice with outcome-\noriented punishment (O\u2019Brien, 1989). One can use punishment and not be abusive.\nI feel that abusive practice is more often a function of an inept parental repertoire\nfor changing the child\u2019s behavior. Nevertheless, in some other cases I think we are\ndealing with adults who loosely fit the criteria for adult and are clearly abusive for\nreasons other than not knowing any better.\nIn many of the circumstances in which I have been involved with through Child\nProtective Services (CPS), I have seen the following scenario. Typically the parent\nwants the child to do something. Because they are not able to get the child to comply\nwith their request (as is the case many other times), they become extremely frustrated.\nThey may try escalating the tone at which the child is told to do something, or get\nin the child\u2019s face, replete with facial grimaces and screaming. When that is to no\navail, they hit. Unfortunately, hitting gets the kids attention this time, thus\nmaintaining it as a more probable parental response for the next crisis situation.\nSubsequent to the spanking, the child moves and begins to comply. This is an\nunfortunate chain of events, because the physical response from the parent did\nproduce movement on the part of the child, whereas other parental responses did\nnot. However, the intensity of the hitting needed to get the child\u2019s attention increases\nover time, until it gets out of hand. Hence, this is not a path I recommend!\nI believe that the parenting solution for child noncompliance is specific and\nconsistent use of systematic consequences. What these parents need is a parental\nresponse that effects child movement much sooner, for both their sakes. Time-out,\nremoval of points, guided positive practice, or loss of privileges (for a short period)\ncan all be effective if the parent is taught how to act early in the compliance scenario.\nThe majority of the parents I have dealt with through CPS did not intend to abuse\ntheir child. However, due to their inconsistent and inept use of any effective\nconsequence, it was just a matter of time. It was a train wreck waiting to happen. The\ncase below illustrates how things can get out of hand, but the key is the systematic\nuse of a punishing consequence.\nThe Case of:\n\u201cI did not know what else to do\u2014so I tied him to a chair!\u201d\nTake the case of Jerry and his mother. Jerry\u2019s mother had been referred\nto me as a result of severe problem behaviors in the home, leading to an\nunfortunate situation that caused CPS to be involved in this case. Jerry was\nnot removed from his mother as a result of this incident, probably due to\nthe lack of any sustainable injury. However, she was mandated to receive\nbehavioral services and implement them with integrity. 38 Section II\nJerry was a 5-year-old boy with mild mental retardation. He also had\nextreme problem behaviors and high levels of activity. He was prescribed\nRitalin and Clonidine for his hyperactivity. Some of the problems reported\nto my behavioral specialist assigned to this case during the initial assessment\nincluded frequent episodes of aggression to others, property destruction,\nabuse to self and noncompliance with parental requests. Additionally, he\nbroke the leg of a neighborhood cat.\nHis mother reported that up to the incident when CPS became\ninvolved his behavior had become unmanageable. He would lose control\ndaily, falling to the floor, kicking, screaming and hitting when either he was\nasked to do something or was told he could not have something he wanted.\nMy behavioral specialist focused initially on compliance to parental\ncommands. By reducing the level of noncompliance, often benefits to\nother problem behaviors accrue.\nIt was most probably a compliance situation on that fateful day. In our\ninitial interview, it was apparent that Jerry\u2019s mother had minimal ability to\neffect compliance with any level of reliability. Observation of their interac-\ntions confirmed that suspicion. Here is a scenario that is representative of\nthe events that transpired in Jerry\u2019s house (this verbal text is a facsimile for\nactual conversation).\nMom: Jerry, I want you to pick up your toys. (said in normal conversational\ntone)\nJerry: No, I don\u2019t want to do it.\nMom: Jerry, I really mean business. The behavioral specialist is here. This\nis what I need you to do. (In more forceful tone)\nJerry: No, I don\u2019t care about the behavioral specialist. (In much louder tone)\nMom: This is really upsetting me. You need to pick up your toys now or\nelse. How would you like it if I take all your toys away (Now the voice\nvolume is just below a scream)\nJerry: You can\u2019t do that! (Falls to the floor in anguish)\nAs you can see, each one challenges the other to exacerbate the\nintensity of the request or denial. It was rare that my behavioral specialist\nsaw Jerry smile during the initial assessment phase. He always seemed angry.\n(Note to reader: he probably figured he had to have his \u201cgame face\u201d on all the time\nfor whenever a request might be given.) Well, one day, his mother said she just\ndid not know how else to deal with him. He just became so unmanageable Exposing Myths About Punishment 39\nthat she felt she had no other alternative but to tie him to a chair. Of course,\nthis was observed by someone in the neighborhood and reported. Hence,\nher current situation.\nOur approach was to understand that Jerry\u2019s mother needed to learn\nhow to consistently implement a strategy. She probably did not intend to\ngo to the lengths she went to that day. However, she just did not know what\nelse to do. The plan designed was the following:\n1. Present a command to Jerry, simple and straightforward, in normal\nconversational tone.\n2. Do not scream with him during his tantrums.\n3. Each time he complies he gets a check.\n4. When he has earned three checks, he gets a preferred activity or item\nfor a period of time.\n5. Failure to comply results in a \u201csit and decide\u201d period (i.e., Jerry would\nhave to sit until he decided to comply with the task).\nAfter my behavioral specialist demonstrated this three-check system\nand the sit and decide procedure with Jerry, his mother followed through\nwith the plan. The results were increased compliance from Jerry, with a\nminimal need for his mother to have to use sit and decide. Jerry probably\nfigured out that it was to his advantage to comply early, where he could get\na check\u2014waiting just meant he would have to comply any way without\ngetting credit. My behavioral specialist\u2019s observations revealed that the\nwhole situation had improved dramatically. He also noted that Jerry started\nlaughing, and seemed to be at ease in his new environment. We believe both\nJerry and his mother are happier now and better off. Punishing Jerry\u2019s\nnoncompliance was essential to this mother-son relationship. Further,\ndeveloping this repertoire in Jerry\u2019s mother reduced the possibility that she\nwould resort to abusive behavior in the future.\n\u2022 Why do you think Jerry\u2019s mother escalated her request when he\ninitially failed to comply with her instruction?\n\u2022 How important was it to increase Jerry\u2019s compliance to his mother\u2019s\ninstructions?\n\u2022 Do you know families where the children\u2019s behavior affects their\nrelationship with their mothers and/or fathers?\nIn California, a state statute prohibiting the use of aversive techniques in\nschools was passed into law in 1993 (California Education Code of Regulations,\n1993). This legislation was the outgrowth of abusive uses of \u201cpunishment\u201d by some\nteachers in special education. An example of the \u201cpunishments\u201d administered was 40 Section II\na teacher who pinched the misbehaving student, by grabbing the student\u2019s skin and\ntwisting it. I know of no research study that has investigated such a procedure. When\npeople start improvising their use of consequences beyond common reason, we have\ntrouble! It is for this reason that I advocate that certain consequences that have been\nverified as effective should not be used without due consideration, and even then\nonly with expert consultation.\nAdditionally, the use of reinforcement for some appropriate behavior is\nimperative, as well as is the removal of specific reinforcement for target behavior.\nTechniques that produce their effect by removing reinforcement when the target\nbehavior occurs have been demonstrated to be quite effective and are the preferred\nconsequences from my perspective. While time-out is probably the most popular of\nthese techniques, there are other consequences that capitalize on reinforcement and\npunishment working hand in hand.\nAre There Risks if Parents Do Not Use Punishment?\nWhat would you guess would be the state of affairs for Jerry in elementary school\nif his behavior had not changed? I have seen too many kids not succeed in school.\nIt is my judgment that many of these kids are intellectually capable. Rather, their\nmisbehavior occurs because they were never taught how to follow instructions of\nadults with any reliability. Dr. Daniel Goleman\u2019s 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence,\ndeals with just this topic. Ask any teacher what the prognosis for educational success\nwould be for a child who refuses to do his assigned work on a daily basis.\nThe greatest \u201clife risk\u201d these children face is that their misbehaviors are not dealt\nwith effectively. They are at risk for not succeeding later in life when adults fail to\nchange critical child problem behaviors at an early stage of their genesis. A child\u2019s\nnoncompliance to parents at age 3 and 4 can lead to more severe forms of\noppositional behavior, such as anger rages, at age 6, 7, 12 and so forth. While some\nparents may not see any problem with their child throwing fits of rage, other people\nwill (e.g., teachers, neighbors, and other adults who come in contact with the child).\nTo not intervene in an effective manner does not sound like a good plan to facilitate\na child\u2019s development into a responsible adult.\nOne of the thoughts behind inaction on the part of the parents is the idea that\ntheir son/daughter is just going through a phase. \u201cOh, he\u2019s just going through the\n\u201cterrible two\u2019s.\u201d I have had kids with severe behavior problems, who apparently went\nthrough the terrible 2\u2019s, 3\u2019s, 4\u2019s and they are getting ready for the terrible 15\u2019s. To\nbelieve that a child will just grow out of these problem behaviors just isn\u2019t the case\nwith many kids. It may happen every once in awhile (most probably due to the efforts of\nsome teachers who take on this role of teaching appropriate behavior and consequating\ninappropriate behaviors when the child enters school). But it is not something to bank your\nchild\u2019s future on. Let\u2019s wait and see what happens next year, when he gets older, does\nnot constitute adequate professional advice. Exposing Myths About Punishment 41\nThe Case of: \u201cIf I could turn back the hands of time.\u201d\nSometimes it is wise to listen and learn from people who have been\nthrough child rearing and have learned what not to do from experience. I\nwish I had a quarter for every time I heard something along the lines of the\nfollowing, \u201cBoy do I wish I could turn back the hands of time.\u201d Here is an\nexample of one mother I was working with, who had two children who were\nfar apart in years. Her oldest child was either a junior or senior in high\nschool, while her younger child was in early elementary school. I was called\nin to teach her how to manage her younger child who had high rates of\nnoncompliance to her instructions, who would tantrum when he did not\nget what he wanted (and so forth). She was doing quite well with the\nrecommended behavioral plan, teaching her child the consequences of\ncomplying with her requests (and of course what happens when you do not\ncomply). She could see that this strategy was working and she put her heart\nand soul into this plan.\nHaving seen how her older son behaved around the house, I hypoth-\nesized why she was so vigorous in her use of the compliance training\nprocedure. My intuition was pretty much on the money when she and I had\na conversation one day. She made a remark to me of the following nature:\n\u201cIf only you were around when my older son was growing up. What I did\nnot know could fill a book. I made so many mistakes and I wish I could take\nthem back.\u201d Her older son was having extreme difficulty in high school and\nwas belligerent at home. Yes, it is too bad that we can\u2019t turn back the hands\nof time. Maybe things would be different from the way they have turned\nout. Unfortunately, in life some mistakes cannot be undone. But let\u2019s not\ntry to rely on a plan that repeats them over and over again.\n\u2022 Why would some parents have difficulty providing specific behavior\nguidelines and consequences for their child?\n\u2022 Is it too late for this parent to change her older son\u2019s behavior?\nHow many of you would volunteer for surgery tomorrow just to see if everything\nthat should be there is there? If you are in good health I assume your answer might\nbe along the following lines: \u201cHeck, no. Use some other technique to verify the status\nof my organs.\u201d Of course the intrusiveness of the surgery is far too great to be\nconsidered for a simple check up. However, let\u2019s change the situation. Suppose you\nget shot with a bullet in the chest. Are you now willing to have the emergency staff\nopen you up to save your life? You see, one must consider the risks at the particular\ntime when evaluating what is in the best interest of the person. 42 Section II\nUsing certain punishing aversive consequences is not something that should be\nlightly considered, particularly if one is only concerned about a minor problem.\nHowever, if I ever get shot, I would certainly waive my right to be free from intrusive\nsurgery if it meant living. In the example below, someone did not take into account\nthe dangerousness of the situation facing the individual.\nDoing Nothing is a Risky Venture?\nOne of the greatest miscarriages of doing nothing was a case of an\nadolescent male in a state hospital for the developmentally disabled. I was\ncalled in to consult with the staff at the hospital for a serious behavioral\nproblem. If you are squeamish, I apologize for the following description of\nhis life-threatening problem. On two prior occasions and more recent to my\nconsultation, this individual took a staple and scratched the underside of\nhis penis, the length of the shaft. Blood was everywhere, and he was rushed\nto emergency at the hospital and fortunately survived this incident.\nI attempted to make sense of his behavior. What purpose or function\nmight such a behavior serve? I drew up a number of treatment procedures,\nbased on several hypotheses about the possible function of the behavior.\nDoes he do this to get attention? Maybe he does this to protest something\nthat happened to him. One of my theories was that this incident was a\nmishap of a behavior that was probably occurring more frequently. He had\nscaly skin, on his leg, which was probably itchy. My hypothesis was that he\nwould use some instrument, or whatever he could get his hands on, to\nscratch the dead skin off. One thing to keep in mind, he is not terribly\ncommunicative due to his developmental disability, thus hampering his\nability to tell staff what the problem is (e.g., \u201cHey I have itchy skin here. Can\nI have something to scratch/relieve the itch?\u201d).\nTo address this hypothesis, I designed a plan that would teach him to\nuse a shower brush for scratching the leg. In this manner, if his skin needed\nscratching, this would do the trick. Further, the disastrous result that\noccurred with the staple, even with a slip of the shower brush would be\nimprobable. However, you must realize I was shooting in the dark, so to\nspeak. The evidence pointing to any of the hypotheses was weak. This one\nmade the most sense to me, upon examining all the evidence. But what if\nI missed the boat? What if I was wrong about this behavior\u2019s function? Then\ngiving him a shower brush would obviously not take care of the problem.\nWe would still have him scratching himself with the staple, with potential\ndisastrous consequences.\nI wanted to cover all possibilities, in light of the seriousness of the\nsituation. I remember telling the hospital psychologist that my plan also\ncalled for a punisher if he was even caught with a single staple, since we most\ncertainly knew he did not intend to staple papers together. My statement Exposing Myths About Punishment 43\nat that time was, \u201cIf my hypothesis about this behavior is wrong, I will at\nleast feel that the use of a punisher will make the behavior less likely. In\nother words I did not want to put all my eggs in one basket, this person\u2019s\nlife may have depended on my being correct.\nThe plan for the use of punishment was the following: If he was caught\nbefore the act or during the act, I wanted him to receive a consequence\ninvolving some extremely aversive smell, taste or sensation. While I know\nsome of you may be inquiring, \u201cwhy do that,\u201d there is research data to\nsupport the use of contingent aversive tastes/smells to decrease target\nbehavior, particularly with individuals in institutional settings. Again, my\napproach was to cover all bases, including the reinforcement of appropriate\nbehavior and the teaching of new adaptive behaviors.\nI submitted the lengthy written plan, which called for the enactment\nof all parts. I left the consultation and the hospital administrator thanked\nme for my input. That was the end of my involvement. I called up the\npsychologist several weeks later, not being on the consultation anymore but\nobviously concerned about the case, and inquired about the client\u2019s\nprogress. To my dismay and horror, nothing had changed. Someone on the\nhuman rights committee was concerned about the individual\u2019s right to be\nfree from aversive tastes or smells as part of the punishment plan. What\nabout his right to not have to be checked into an emergency room in a life-\nthreatening situation.\nWhat was missing here is perspective. Taking risks is relative. When\nyou are pretty comfortable, you need not take risks. But if your situation\nchanges drastically, risks of treatment have to be weighed against the\nramifications of the continued maintenance of the problem. I would\nventure to say that most people would not like to have to receive injections\non a daily basis. But people with diabetes subject themselves to this\nintrusion every day. Risk is relative.\n\u2022 Why would the plan (i.e., to give him a brush for his scaly skin) not\nwork if my hypothesis (regarding the behavior\u2019s function) was inaccurate?\n\u2022 What are other circumstances in everyday life where risk is relative to\nbenefit?\nThe risk of not intervening effectively with child problem behaviors is far greater\nthan some of the purported risks of using punishment. The next time someone says\nto you, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried that using time-out will pose problems,\u201d you should\nmake the following reply. \u201cNot as worried as having my 7-year-old son fail to learn\nhow to behave in a nonaggressive manner on the playground.\u201d That risk is too great,\nand using time-out will be far outweighed by the benefits of having him learn to play\nappropriately with other kids on the playground. 44 Section II\nMyth #2: Punishment Temporarily Suppresses Behavior\n(And Therefore Is Not Worth the Effort)\nIsn\u2019t It Common Knowledge that Punishment Only Works\nTemporarily?\nAn often-stated characteristic of punishment is that the effect on the behavior\nbeing punished is only temporary (i.e., punishment merely suppresses behavior).\nTherefore, punishment is not worthy of consideration as a strategy, since it does not\nwork in the long run.\nThis misconception is exemplified in the following hypothetical illustration\ninvolving a daughter\u2019s frequent disrespectful comments toward her mother. Let\u2019s say\nMrs. Rodriguez decides to take action in the following manner. She will fine her 11\u2013\nyear-old daughter, Holly, a quarter each time she is disrespectful to her. On Sunday\nnight, Mrs. Rodriguez tells Holly that any disrespectful comments made to her will\ncost Holly a quarter from her $5 weekly allowance, beginning tomorrow. Mrs.\nRodriguez begins the behavioral plan on Monday. After breakfast, Mrs. Rodriguez\nasks Holly to get her backpack ready for school. Holly says, \u201cstop bossing me around,\nI am old enough to know when I should get ready!\u201d Mrs. Rodriguez calmly informs\nHolly that her disrespectful comment cost her one-quarter and she goes to the chart\nto cross out one quarter from her allowance chart. This generates a caustic outburst\nfrom Holly, \u201cYou rotten ****, you can\u2019t treat me like that!\u201d Instead of getting\nflustered like she had in the past, Mrs. Rodriguez simply goes to the chart and crosses\nout another quarter. This pattern of disrespectful comments by Holly, with\nsubsequent fines of one quarter for each incident, persists another three times. Holly\napologizes before getting on the bus for school, but the fines stick.\nAfter 2 weeks, Holly\u2019s disrespectful comments have decreased from about 3-5\nper day before the plan was in effect, to less than one every two days. With this\nimprovement, Mrs. Rodriguez feels Holly has learned her lesson. She has become\na more feeling, caring daughter and has seen the error in her ways. (Note to reader: if\nI had a dollar for every time I have heard this!) She informs Holly that starting next week\nthe fine program will be discontinued. It is up to Holly to \u201cthink before she opens\nher mouth.\u201d Do you believe that Holly has become a new person? Will Holly accept\nher responsibility to treat her mother with the same respect she wishes to receive?\nIf this were a movie, the answer might be \u201cyes.\u201d As you might guess, too often\nthe scenario is more like the following. Holly\u2019s use of disrespectful comments starts\nto increase until she is once again an impudent child, according to her mother. Her\nmother and her friends surmise that this behavioral plan did not work, since Holly\nis still being disrespectful. But was it a failure? I think not. The failure was in not\nkeeping a good thing going!\nNote that when the parent implements the punishing consequence each time\nthe behavior occurs, the behavior becomes less frequent. In some cases in my\nexperience, it disappears for long periods of time. When Holly was fined each and\nevery time she made a disrespectful comment to her mother, the occurrence of such Exposing Myths About Punishment 45\ncomments went down dramatically. However, once the possibility of a fine was\nremoved, disrespectful comments began to reoccur, eventually wiping out the\nprogress made previously. Thus, many people point out that the short-term effect\nof the punishing consequence (i.e., the fine) is negated once the adult halts its use.\nTherefore, the implication is that parents should find something else that produces\na long-term effect. My retort is, \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d\nIs this a Valid Criticism of Punishment?\nNo, absolutely not! As the previous scenario shows, effective consequences do\ndecrease a child\u2019s behavior. Whether it produces long lasting change is debatable at\nthis point of the research.\nHowever, for argument sake, let me consider the premise that punishment is\nonly able to reduce or eliminate a behavior while it is in effect. Is this a sufficient\nreason to not consider its use in child behavior management? Perhaps an answer to\nthis criticism of punishment can best be addressed by the following illustration.\nSuppose the state government decides to remove the monetary fine from traffic\ntickets. Since punishment purportedly only suppresses behavior, we should remove\nfines for traffic violations and come up with something better. As some self-\nproclaimed experts would have you believe, perhaps having the police officer catch\nthe rule violator and appeal to his/her sense of duty or logic and give the explanation\nof the possible consequences of reckless driving. This would be would be just as\neffective, right? Not! As you can imagine, the number of infractions would increase\ndramatically! Neither you nor I would feel safe on the roads anymore. Anyone who\nhas lived on this planet as an adult would not seriously entertain removing monetary\nfines as a consequence of breaking the traffic laws in favor of having police discuss\nthe potential for endangering lives due to traffic violation behavior.\nWould we then conclude that fining people for traffic violations is ineffective,\nbecause once you remove the law allowing for police to issue a fine, people start\nviolating traffic laws! I think most people would conclude the opposite: The fine\nsystem does work, and it needs to be in place to control the rate of traffic violations.\nWithout it we would have mayhem on the streets. One would not object to the use\nof the traffic fine as a consequence, on the grounds that it merely suppresses drivers\u2019\nunlawful road behavior. If fines keep people in line while they are in effect, they are\nnecessary in the effort to get people to drive according to the law and to save lives.\nWhen you cut in line at a theme park, and get caught, you can be ejected from\nthe park. It is this consequence, and the threat of its use, that most probably keeps\nsuch behavior down to a minimum. Would you want to go to a park that would just\ninform those transgressors that they have probably hurt the other people\u2019s feelings?\nNot unless you enjoy verbal and physical altercations with your fellow human\nbeings, in which case some reality TV show is looking for you. Again, one would not\nsee the use of ejecting people from the park, who are caught cutting in line, as a\npunishing consequence that only is effective for the short-term. Its continued use\nwould be mandated by park officials and the overwhelming majority of the paying\npublic alike. 46 Section II\nAre we expecting too much from any intervention, when we desire that\nintervention to \u201ccure\u201d the child from engaging in the prohibited behavior after\ndeploying such procedures only 3 times, 10 times, or for 2 weeks? What is the logic\nin thinking that a misbehavior the child has engaged in for 6 months will go away\nfor good, in just 1 week, when parents use a persistent discipline strategy, no matter\nwhat that strategy is? Have we cured depression with a 1-week program?\nI often tell parents there are usually no miracles in getting children to change\nlong-standing misbehaviors that put them in conflict with their environment. I\nproceed by first figuring out what will reduce such behavior in the next week, see if\nit works, and continue it if it does. Once the parents and I have solved the short-term\nproblem (i.e., getting an immediate change in problem behavior), then we move to\nsolving it in the longer term. Let us not put the cart before the horse, so to speak. Our\nfirst job is to get a change in the behavior as soon as possible. Let\u2019s worry about what\nwe are going to do 3 months from now when we cross that bridge.\nWhat is the Scientific Basis for the Argument that Punishment\nProduces Only Temporary Results?\nIn 1944, Estes published a study that used rats (the animal) to determine the\neffects of a punishing event, such as electric shock, on bar pressing behavior. He first\ntrained rats to press a bar, and reinforced this behavior with food pellets. Once the\nbar press response was developed, Estes then proceeded to continue putting the rats\nin the cage, except that two events were altered. First, a bar press no longer resulted\nin a food pellet (called extinction or removal of reinforcement). Additionally, an\nelectric shock was delivered each time the rat pressed the bar. Therefore, when the\nrat pressed the bar, no food was delivered and a shock was presented instead.\nThese two conditions were in effect for the first 10 minutes of each training\nsession. Of course, during these 10-minute periods, rats desisted from pressing the\nbar. Subsequent to this 10-minute session, the rat was removed from the cage for a\nshort period of time. The rat was then placed back into the cage. During this second\ntraining period, only the lack of food delivery for bar press occurred (called the post\ntest session). The question becomes the following: Will the rat press the bar during\nthis non shock period, since s/he had received contingent shock just a few minutes\nago? In other words, will the effect of the shock extend to a period where no shock\nis used? Rats in this post-test session behaved just like rats that had not been exposed\nto shock and began pressing the bar, with the result being only the lack of food\ndelivery.\nAs a result of this experiment and ones similar to this, behavioral researchers at\nthe time concluded that punishment is ineffective in modifying a behavior that was\npreviously reinforced. They reported that punishment only suppresses behavior and\nthat removal of the punishment consequence results in the behavior reappearing. As\na side comment, it is important to note that in these experiments, bar pressing was\nthe only behavior taught to the rats that produced food. Suppose the animal was\ntaught that another behavior produced food (e.g., calling Pizza Palace), while bar Exposing Myths About Punishment 47\npressing still resulted in shock and no food delivery. What might the results have\nbeen then?\nDoesn\u2019t the Estes Study Prove that a Temporary Effect of\nPunishment is the Norm?\nFirst, one should not make conclusions beyond what a study allows for. What\ndid the above study (and similar laboratory studies at the time) actually show? The\nEstes (1944) study demonstrated that the punishing effects of shock, contingent\nupon the rat\u2019s bar press response, did not extend to a period shortly after each 10-\nminute training session. Can we then jump to conclude that the same short-term\neffect would have occurred if the rats had received punishment for bar pressing for\na 3-month continuous period? Does a study that utilizes short periods of pairings of\nthe punisher with the response allow one to generalize the findings to everyday life\nand conditions? Suppose a consequence is consistently applied for a proscribed\nchild behavior for weeks or even months. Will it return once the consequence is\nterminated? In some cases, probably so. In other cases, I think not!\nThe existing data from these laboratory research studies do not provide a clear\nanswer to this question, because they were so limited in scope. What conclusion I\nwould find credible regarding the rat studies cited above is that if you punish a\nbehavior for ten minutes, it may not generalize to a period after that where\npunishment is made unavailable. So if you want to cure your child of lying in the\nnext ten minutes for the rest of his life, you are probably going to be disappointed\nwith the result. However, I do feel that there is considerable clinical evidence that\nlong-term effects can occur with an established contingency.\nThe Case of: \u201cStealing is in His Blood!\u201d\nIn some cases, a behavioral pattern of long-standing nature can be\naddressed via a plan that incorporates punishment of the proscribed target\nproblem behavior and reinforcement of its absence. A foster family I was\ninvolved with had several children, all of them coming from the same\nmother. One of the boys (Roberto, who was 9 years old at the time) had\nmultiple problems. Further, he had not shown any progress in developing\na \u201cconscience\u201d in the year he had resided in his new home. One of the most\nserious problems was stealing money and various things from family\nmembers as well as from classmates at school. This was apparently a\nbehavioral pattern he picked up early in life. His biological mother felt her\nchildren should fend for themselves, hence his early exposure to shoplift-\ning. I would imagine you could guess why he and his siblings were removed\nfrom their mother.\nThis behavioral pattern obviously distressed and annoyed the new\nfoster parents. His foster father in particular was adamant about teaching\nhim that this was wrong. Due to his early exposure to stealing food in order 48 Section II\nto eat, he had developed into quite and adept (and frequent) usurper of\nother people\u2019s possessions.\nPrior to my involvement, the foster father had tried many strategies to\nrid Roberto of his stealing behavior. He tried pleading with him, discussing\nsociety\u2019s prohibition against stealing, appealing to his better judgment,\ntrying to induce guilt and shame over stealing others possessions, ground-\ning him, and other strategies. Unfortunately, none of these worked to\neliminate this behavior. The father was in angst over each new episode of\nRoberto taking something from either a family member or getting a call\nfrom school regarding theft. It was essential that I design a plan to\naccomplish a short-term dramatic reduction of stealing. His current place-\nment was in jeopardy, as both his foster father and his wife had doubts about\ntheir keeping Roberto. Further, I could not imagine that any other family\nwould love to have a child that transfers possession of property from\nsomebody else to himself. The only place I know that accepts these types\nof children is- you guessed it.\nThe plan I came up with was borrowed from several researchers at\nFlorida State University (Switzer, Deal, & Bailey, 1977). It involved\nplanting items around the house in conspicuous spots to monitor stealing\n(I called this the planted item technique). Each day the father would place\nseveral items, including money, in designated places (unannounced to\nRoberto). This allowed his father to systematically track stealing by\nchecking each place where something was left, in addition to the usual\ncheck procedures.\nRoberto was informed of the plan the night before it was to go into\neffect. If all the items remained in their place at the end of the day and there\nwere no other reports of stealing, Roberto received $.50 for the day.\nHowever, if something was missing, the punishing consequences involved\nthe following: (1) return item(s) stolen, (2) lose the stipend amount for that\nday, and (3) pay a penalty equal to double the value of the item(s) taken.\nNote that this plan had consequences for stealing as well as for not stealing.\nI believe the father also threw in early bedtime as well.\nAs you can imagine, his rate of stealing went down. In a several week\nperiod, he was no longer stealing, and this was also confirmed at school.\nStopping this behavior had a profound impact on Roberto\u2019s position with\nhis foster parents. Probably one of the nicest outcomes of changing\nRoberto\u2019s behavior happened on one of my visits to the home. His foster\nmother was so proud of him. In the earlier part of the week, Roberto had\nreturned some planted money to her, saying he found it (planted item) and\nthat she must have lost it. She thought he had finally turned the corner on\nhis past! He had become someone who had a conscience.\nRoberto also improved in other areas. His foster parents had misgivings\nabout his placement early on as a result of his mischief when they had to Exposing Myths About Punishment 49\nhire a baby-sitter to go out together. He had several people quit, and these\nwere people in their 20s. The mother\u2019s note to me on one instance early\nin the behavioral program illustrated this problem. \u201cMy husband and I\nwent to a class at the junior college. The baby-sitter became so frazzled that\nshe had to call my parents (who live nearby) to come over and calm him\ndown. He was yelling at her, saying he did not have to listen to her.\u201d The\nlast sentence of this note said, \u201cPlease help us with this boy.\u201d\nTo handle the baby-sitting crisis, we instituted a plan that was similar\nto one designed for him at school. This one was called the baby-sitter report\ncard. Verbal refusal, aggressive attempts or postures, and leaving the house\nwere three behaviors that we held Roberto accountable for while his parents\nwere out of the house. The baby-sitter merely had to mark if either of these\noccurred. When his parents came home, if the baby-sitter reported on the\ncard that one or more incidents of the above three behaviors occurred, he\nwent to bed early that day and the next. With this plan, these behaviors\nrapidly disappeared. The real test of its efficacy can perhaps be seen in the\nincreased number of new baby-sitters the parents could now deploy.\nWhoever has the report card has Roberto\u2019s attention. The baby-sitters\nhailed, \u201cThe day of fearing Roberto is over!\u201d\nAbout a year and a half later, I became involved with this family for\nanother child in their care. They reported to me that Roberto had not had\na problem with stealing since the last time I saw him and the program had\nbeen discontinued some time ago. It is important to remember that\nalthough he now demonstrates responsibility, the change in behavior was\ninitially the result of a behavioral plan that rewarded him for not stealing,\nalong with a severe penalty for stealing. He also had continued improve-\nments in those other areas.\n\u2022 What are the similarities between the designated plan for stealing and\nthe behavioral plan developed to deal with the baby-sitter scenario?\n\u2022 Do you believe that some children learn to steal at an early age? How\nso?\nIs there Any Research Evidence that Punishing Effects Are Not\nAlways Temporary?\nAs I indicated previously, there is unfortunately an insufficient research base to\nallow a scientific response to this question. If punishment effects can extend beyond\ntheir use, we currently do not know the factors involved that make long-term effects\nmore likely. It is apparent that some children need their parents to follow through\nwith the plan for months before even considering partially removing it. However,\nin many such cases, the punishing consequence is only rarely needed, since the rate 50 Section II\nof problem behavior is low or non-existent. A research study that targeted dangerous\ninfant behaviors is a good illustration of the effectiveness of a punishment conse-\nquence in reducing the rate of behavior to low levels (Matthews, Friman, Barunc,\nRoss, & Christophersen, 1987).\nResearchers at University of Kansas, under the direction of Dr. Mark Matthews,\nworked with parents whose infant children, at or under 1 year of age, displayed\npotentially dangerous behaviors. Such behaviors included playing around the wall\nsocket, being in an area where the child could fall, or other similar hazardous\nconditions for the infants. Any parent can relate to this serious problem area. All four\nparents had tried to simply remove their child from the danger area (often called re-\ndirection).\nAs many parents will tell you, simply moving the infant in another direction does\nnot work. Many infants will continue to go back after being re-directed, thus\nnecessitating continued vigilance on the part of the parent. It is unfortunate, but true,\nthat many infants do not learn to avoid the hazard or danger, with this commonly\naccepted practice. While the technique is certainly something that no one would\nfind objectionable, it also is ineffective. Hence, a technique that develops the infant\u2019s\nactive avoidance of the danger condition, because of an effective punishing\nconsequence, is required.\nAll four parents were taught to use time-out for their infant child. Immediately\nupon the child entering the danger condition, the parent was taught to say \u201cno,\u201d\nplace the infant in the playpen, and wait until she or he was quiet for 5-10 seconds.\nIn addition these parents were also given specific suggestions by the trainers on child\nproofing those hazards in their home that represented potential danger.\nDuring the baseline, the parents were instructed to intervene (i.e., re-direct the\nchild) when they thought it was needed. This strategy could then be compared with\nthe time-out procedure in its effectiveness. The table below provides the dramatic\ncontrast between baseline and the use of time-out on each infant\u2019s percentage of time\nin hazard conditions.\nInfant Baseline Time-out %Change\n1 55% 6% 49%\n2 32% 3% 29%\n3 35% 10% 25%\n4 37% 4% 33%\nThe percentage of intervals the infant spent in potentially hazardous situations\nis significant before treatment. For example, infant 1 spent 55% of the time observed\nin hazardous situations. Note the low rate of all the infants being in a potentially Exposing Myths About Punishment 51\ndangerous situation when time-out was in effect. Infant 1 went from 55% before\ntraining to 6% after his parent started using time-out.\nAs I indicated previously, the mark of an effective consequence is that it reduces\nthe rate of the target behavior to such a low level that the consequence rarely has to\nbe deployed (Perone, 2003). Such was the case in this research study. Both infants\n2 and 4 had 5 consecutive days during which the mother did not have to use time-\nout even once, since the infant never approached the hazard area! We would all agree\nthat getting a child to learn to avoid the situation, with the advent of time-out\navailable, is much more effective than constantly re-directing the infant.\nThese researchers revisited these 4 families 7 months after the termination of\nparent training (called a follow-up assessment). They observed the infants to see if\nthey had continued to avoid the identified hazard conditions. Three of the four\nchildren (now between 17 and 19 months of age) did not receive one time-out during\nthe observation period. One child did receive one time-out. All the mothers reported\nthat they eventually liked the time-out and used it. This anecdotal finding was\nimportant information since some of the mothers reported they were distressed at\ntheir child\u2019s initial crying during the first few time-outs. When a punisher works, it\noften is the case that the child does not engage in the behavior that produces it: a\npleasing state of affairs for everyone!\nAnother possibility in attempting to produce long-term results is to gradually\nremove the punishment contingencies by fading the daily use of such. How this\nfading procedure can be accomplished was the target of a research study conducted\nat a facility called Achievement Place (Bailey, Wolf, & Phillips, 1970). This facility\nhoused children who were delinquent and court adjudicated. One of the techniques\ndeveloped in this research program was called the Daily Report Card (for detailed\npresentation, see Cipani, 1999). Each student was monitored as to his study behavior\nat school and rule violations. The teacher filled out the card for two questions: (1)\ndid the child obey the classroom rules (Yes or No) and (2) did the child study the\nwhole period (Yes or No). If the child had both questions marked with a Yes, he got\nspecial privileges at home that evening. If he had even one No, then he lost all\nprivileges that evening and had to do extra chores to earn them back.\nAs you might imagine, with the possibility of losing privileges, the boys\nmanaged to increase their attention to their schoolwork during the two math periods\nthe program was in effect. Further, the rate of rule violations become non-existent\non most days and minimal on others.\nIn a last experiment in a series of experiments, the researchers tested the efficacy\nof a fading program. The report card would go home only on Tuesdays and Fridays\nof each week. The teacher could mark the card for incidents that occurred in between.\nFor example, if the child had a rule violation on Monday, the Tuesday report card\nreflected that fact. The results indicated that for both rule violations and study\nbehavior the impressive gains made for the daily reporting system were maintained\nwith this faded system of twice per week over a 22-day period. 52 Section II\nHow Long Does a Parent Need to Use a Punisher Before Its Effects\nBecome Enduring?\nI unfortunately do not have a magical number because each child and family are\nunique. Parents must realize that the deployment of any behavioral plan probably\nneeds to be maintained for longer than 2-3 weeks. The child\u2019s problem behavior may\nhave a several month to several year history of development. Therefore the effort to\nchange it has to be of some reasonable time period. I often give parents this piece\nof advice: \u201cThis behavior did not get here yesterday and it probably won\u2019t disappear\nfrom sight tomorrow.\u201d\nLet\u2019s take the hypothetical case of Jack. Jack would make mean comments and\nremarks toward his sister, e.g., \u201cYou are stupid.\u201d His parents decided to use early\nbedtime as a consequence for mean remarks to his sister. Each time Jack told his\nyounger sister that she was dumb or stupid, or when he called her ugly, he received\na negative check mark on the calendar. If Jack had two check marks on a given day,\nhe went to bed a half hour early. Of course his sister gets to stay up until regular\nbedtime, if she did not retaliate. If he had 3 checks he went to bed 1 hour early. More\nthan 3 checks in a day, he went to bed right after supper. As you might imagine, the\nnumber of days he went to bed early, in the first 3 weeks of the plan, were few and\nfar between. This represented a dramatic improvement in his mean remarks to his\nsister. His parents continued the program for the next 5 weeks. On the 12th week,\nJack\u2019s parents made the following changes: one comment results in one hour early\nbedtime, two or more comments result in going to bed after supper. Again, Jack\nlearned to control his \u201cmean-spirited\u201d behavior as a result of these consequences.\nHow long should Jack\u2019s parents carry out this plan? If Jack\u2019s behavior has\noccurred for about a year, his parents might consider keeping the initial plan intact\nfor an additional several month period. If Jack\u2019s progress on this behavior is\nmaintained across that time period, the parents might then consider altering parts\nof the plan. Changing child behavior is a race for distance runners, not sprinters!\nThe Power of Parental Consequences-\nthe Case of Getting Dressed\nIn some cases, a consequence is so powerful that its use becomes so\ninfrequent, because the target behavior stops occurring. One of my\nbehavioral specialists was working with a family of a girl who hated to get\ndressed in the morning. Every morning she would complain that she did\nnot like the clothes set out for her. Her mother would give her another\nchoice, however, the battle royale would often not stop there. She found the\nnew version equally distasteful and the argument over what to wear to\nschool would resume. The mom reported that this back and forth arguing,\nyelling, and tantrumming about getting dressed occurred every morning. Exposing Myths About Punishment 53\nObservation by the behavioral specialist revealed that such an interaction\nwas a morning ritual between mom and daughter.\nFortunately for us, this girl was addicted to TV, which apparently was\nconsidered a constitutional right in this home (at least this was the belief of\nthe girl). The behavioral plan was simple: require her to change her clothes\nfive times a day. Each time she would get dressed without tantrum behavior\nor any other form of refusal, she would earn a check. To get TV the next day,\nshe would need five checks (i.e., perfect performance). If she wanted to\nargue about getting dressed it was going to cost her TV privileges the\nfollowing day. In a three-month intervention period, how often do you\nthink she lost TV? Once! Yes, I said once! You see, sometimes a contingency\nworks so well you need use it only sparingly, and the problem behavior is\n\u201csuppressed\u201d for a long time.\nWhat Should a Parent Do if the Child\u2019s Problem Behavior Returns\nto Its Previous Unacceptable Level?\nThe reassuring news is that if you remove the consequence and the behavior\nproblem reappears, research definitely points to the efficacy of reinstating the\npunishment contingency. Reinstating the consequence will almost always result in\nan eventual return to low levels of the child\u2019s target problem behavior, as was\nachieved before.\nIn many of the clinical cases my behavioral specialists and I have been involved\nwith, we intervene for a 3- to 6-month period. By the end of that period, if we have\ndesigned an effective strategy, the problem behavior has disappeared or certainly\nreduced in frequency, to a tolerable level. We terminate the case successfully, wish\nthe family well, and move on to other families with challenging problems. However,\nit is not uncommon to get a call from the parent, sometimes several weeks after\nsuccessfully terminating, with a phrase out of the movies: \u201cIt\u2019s back (meaning the\nproblem behavior)!\u201d In most cases, simply reinstating the previous plan works as it\ndid before.\nLet\u2019s suppose Jack\u2019s parents had decided that they would no longer \u201chold early\nbedtime over his head.\u201d If Jack promised that he would treat his sister with the respect\nhe has learned to show her over the past 12 weeks, they would allow him his regular\nbedtime every night. Guess what. Although Jack promised to respect his sister, in a\nfew weeks he is back to calling her the names on a daily basis. So much for promises!\nJack realizes that this behavior no longer produces loss of regular bedtime. Now,\nJack\u2019s parents are even more upset with him because in addition to being mean to\nhis sister, he also does not keep promises. What are Jack\u2019s parents to do? (Note to\nreader: this is often the reason why the parents claim the behavioral plan did not work. The\nchild\u2019s problem behavior reappears when they drop the plan abruptly.) 54 Section II\nLuckily, Jack\u2019s parents don\u2019t panic and call 911. After taking a deep breath and\nrecollecting themselves, Jack\u2019s parents redeploy the original plan, with early bedtime.\nTwo check marks on a given day result in Jack going to bed a half- hour earlier. Three\nchecks result in him going to bed one hour early. More than three checks, result in\nhim going to bed right after supper. With this \u201cheads-up\u201d thinking, Jack\u2019s parents see\na return to desirable interactions with family members.\nIf a behavior returns, the parent should simply reassess the problem and return\nthe plan, in force, to retrieve the more acceptable level of behavior. Very often this\nreturn to the effective manner of dealing with the misbehavior is the key.\nMyth # 3: Punishment Causes Problems for\na Child\u2019s Emotional Development\nWhat Types of Problems Are Purported to Occur with the Use of\nPunishment?\nPunishment is at the root of all evil, or at least at the root of emotional and\nbehavioral difficulties a child exhibits, as some would contend. When a child\nmisbehaves, you may have heard some people refer to the child\u2019s behavior as \u201cacting\nout.\u201d You might have been dumbfounded since you saw no relationship between\nhitting the wall in anger and some acting performance on the part of the child. Acting\nout refers to an assumption that the child is acting out his internal conflict(s) through\nthe misbehavior. This conflict is theorized to occur when the child\u2019s natural desires\ncome in conflict with the dictates of the environment, A.K.A, parental conse-\nquences.\nFurther, such difficulties are theorized to extend past childhood, to affect the\npersonality of the adult, unless unresolved conflicts created by punishment become\nresolved. People who have a variety of difficulties as adults are assumed to have been\nthe recipients of great amounts of severe punishment as children. Proponents of this\ntheory conduct the following research. Someone who is maladjusted as an adult is\ninterviewed as to their being the victim of punishment. The person reports that his\nor her parents were strict. Being strict, usually invoking corporal or physical\npunishment, is equated (incorrectly) with punishment. Hence punishment is linked\nwith whatever type of social mal-adjustment the individual exhibits.\nIf you have kept track of one of the central arguments of this book, my objection\nto these anecdotes is probably already clear to you. What definition was used for\npunishment? Yes, a procedural definition was probably invoked. One cannot\nascertain that such a consequence effected successful changing of any misbehavior\nwith these people during their childhood. But to these critics, paddling and\npunishment are synonymous. Hence these critics conclude punishment did occur.\nFurther it is invoked as the causal factor in the person\u2019s current malaise.\nIf we by-pass the outcome-oriented definition issue for the minute, what is\nwrong with linking severe parental consequences to current or future social malad-\njustment? Because he got paddled, he is now the town alcoholic. This event, to the Exposing Myths About Punishment 55\nexclusion of all other events that were part of this child\u2019s upbringing, is deemed to\nbe the responsible causal agent. How can anyone pointing to that event be absolutely\ncertain that one caused the other? Why is such an explanation taken as fact by the\nprofessional community? Can you say Freud?\nAs you might have guessed by now, this certainty on the part of such proponents\nis rooted in psychoanalytic theory. Probably the most popularized maxim of this\nfictional account of the genesis of adult problem behavior is the often-cited scenario\nof punishment during toilet training. As the story goes, punishment during toilet\ntraining can be the causal factor in the genesis of all kinds of human frailties from\nanxiety disorders to personality quirks. According to Freud and many of his ardent\nfollowers, punishment during toddler toilet training produces a conflict. The\nconflict exists between the needs of the child to be uninhibited with respect to urges\nand the environment\u2019s requirement for certain proscribed behaviors. If adults would\nnot impose any requirements on where elimination occurs, I guess Freud would say\nthat intrapsychic conflict would not occur, at least with regards to that psychosexual\nstage. Of course Freud didn\u2019t speculate how many of these uninhibited children\nwould become teenagers who would be perfectly comfortable having bowel move-\nments in their pants. Perhaps that would not have been much of a social problem\nin Vienna in the early part of the 20th century. While this particular version of how\npunishment effects later behavior may be out of favor with regard to large scale\npopularity, its cousins (regarding early experiences as primary factors in adult\nbehavior) are still alive and well in our culture.\nHow many times have you seen a movie called a psychological thriller that\ndepicts a ruthless psychopath wrecking destruction in his/her wake. At some point\nin the movie, the movie viewer is given a glimpse of the psychopath\u2019s life as a child,\nrelating some aspect of his or her upbringing to the development of this wretched\npersonality. If only this child would not have been punished by his cold cruel mother\nwhile having sexual feelings for his older sister, when he was eight years old, he would\nnot have grown up to become the Philadelphia Strangler. Unfortunately, it becomes\ndifficult for the public to separate fiction in the movie from fact. This logic regarding\nthe disastrous long-term effects of punishment pervades many professional and lay\npublics\u2019 explanation for a child\u2019s problem behaviors. The fictional anecdote below\nillustrates the nature of this logic.\nVera: Hey Margie, good to see you. How\u2019s everything? How\u2019s your son, Johnny?\nHow is he doing in school? I know he has had a rough time in the past. Have\nthings improved for him?\nMargie: Oh, I think things are going to get much better. He is still having difficulties,\nbut thanks to a wonderful book I am reading about disturbed children, I finally\ncomprehend the reason for Johnny\u2019s difficulties. 56 Section II\nVera: That sounds great! You know my son, Harold, had problems in following\nteachers\u2019 directions. They would ask him to come inside from free play and he\nwould be oppositional and disrespectful as well. I worked with the teacher on\nthis. I told Harold he was to start following such teachers\u2019 directions. I gave the\nteachers permission to subtract free time from his upcoming recesses when he\nfailed to come back to class upon command. Further, the teacher lets me know\nif he has called her names each day. If he calls the teacher names, I remove all\nhis afternoon and evening privileges. He cannot go out with his friends that\nafternoon and loses all TV access that night. It gives him lots of time to think\nabout how he will handle himself tomorrow. Since the first few incidents in the\nfirst 3 weeks of school the teacher is now reporting that Harold is much\nimproved and has not lost any free time for the last 5 consecutive weeks. Why\ndon\u2019t you consider something along those lines, it worked great for Harold.\nMargie: Oh no, that is the wrong way according to this book I am reading. (Note to\nreader: Proponents of the Dr. Do-nothing approach are not cognizant of real life results\nand data.) In his book, How to Handle Your Emotionally Sensitive Yet Gifted Child,\nDr. Do-nothing clearly explains that such punishment proceduresmake\nchildren resentful of authority. Further, that resentment builds over time so that\nthey carry this resentment of authority figures to all aspects of their life. This can\nthen lead to your child becoming an adult who does not trust other people, thus\nleading to an insecure and emotionally fragile existence.\nVera: You don\u2019t say? (with a look of bewilderment)\nMargie: This is why my Johnny has such a difficult time in school with teachers. I\nunfortunately would put him in time-out when he would hit me, before I read\nthis wonderful book. Even though he stopped hitting me when I used time-out\nconsistently, unfortunately, Dr. Do-nothing believes that this parental response\nto hitting built up a lot of emotional turmoil inside of Johnny. You see, not\nbeing trained in these things, I had no way of knowing that I was causing him\nmore harm than good. I was putting my need to have him respect me ahead of\nhis need to explore his environment in a safe manner, free from inhibition.\nPunishing him with time-out shook the bond of trust and attachment he had\nwith me. His misbehavior was a reflection of this lack of trust. So I had to stop\nusing time-out consequences for his behavior to begin to rebuild our relation\nship. I now try to understand what he is going through as he struggles with these\ntrust issues. It would be harmful to punish him for his struggles. (Note to reader:\nThe misbehavior is disregarded, because of this hypothesized \u201cstruggle.\u201d) While it is true\nthat he was suspended 5 times just this year because he was disrespectful to\nteachers, he is growing emotionally. Thanks to Dr. Do-nothing, I have learned\nthat his rebellion is just a stage that he must go through before he achieves\nharmony with his environment. Then he will become a responsible young\nperson. It is within him, I only hope I don\u2019t get in the way of his development. Exposing Myths About Punishment 57\nVera: Well that is interesting. (Thought to herself: Boy I would burn that book if I\nwere Margie.) I hope everything goes better for you and Johnny. Maybe we\ncan get together Wednesday afternoon for coffee.\nMargie: I would love to, but I have another parent-teacher conference because\nJohnny told the principal that he would stay out on the jungle gym as long as\nhe wanted to. I have to go straighten them out about the needs of this type of\nchild: the emotionally sensitive yet intellectually gifted child. These people just\ndon\u2019t know how to handle children like Johnny.\nWhat is Wrong with this Contention?\nPrimarily that it is an unproven contention. Is there cause and effect research\ndata to demonstrate that using a punishing consequence for a target problem\nbehavior produces harmful effects to a child\u2019s development? Obviously not, since\nmost of the information for this theory regarding the harmful effects of punishment\nis a post hoc inspection of childhood events, long after the fact. In addition, one\nlooks for parental practices as the culprit of adult maladjustment, to the exclusion\nof all other phenomenon.\nWhat would be reasonable scientific evidence that outcome-oriented punish-\nment, while effective for the target behaviors, produces immediate deleterious short-\nterm effects? Two findings should appear in studies. First, the punishing conse-\nquence would produce a change in the target behavior (i.e., outcome-oriented\npunishment). Second, a concurrent side effect to other behaviors or aspects of the\nchild\u2019s life would result. In other words, only successful demonstrations of punish-\ning consequences would qualify as the criteria for studying harmful side effects. I am\nsure that unsuccessful uses of consequences have disastrous effects, primarily where\nthe target (mis)behavior is still rampant in the child\u2019s repertoire.\nWhat Harm Would Such a Myth Cause?\nIf someone led us to believe that taking a flu shot for the flu is a dangerous\nintervention because it leads to insanity 3 months after ingestion, what would be the\neffect on public health if the public believed it? You can readily see what would\nhappen. People would stop getting flu shots. It certainly would make many more\npeople sicker with flu symptoms than need be, perhaps increasing the mortality rate\nfrom catching the flu. Of course, this unsupported contention regarding the\nrelationship between the flu, getting a flu shot, and becoming mentally deranged\nwould be quickly discounted as having no basis in scientific findings by the medical\nprofession. However, unsupported contentions regarding causal variables of emo-\ntional problems people experience have never been brought to the fore for the same\ncritical analysis by scientists.\nWhat is wrong, and subsequently deleterious, with the contention that Johnny\u2019s\nmother makes (that use of consequences are what causes his problems at school)?\nNote that the focus of concern for her and Dr. Do-nothing is not the immediate\nbehavioral effects of any strategy on his school behavior. As many of you would 58 Section II\nagree, the focus of concern should be on Johnny\u2019s problem behavior at school. Why\nwould she not be concerned about his behavior at school? Perhaps because she has\nbeen brain washed into believing that there are bigger fish to fry. Unfortunately, his\nbehavior at school, in desperate need of contingencies, never gets that intervention.\nAnd the effect on his subsequent behavior is one of non-effect. In fact, with\nprofessional suggestions such as removal of consequences for undesirable behaviors,\nwhat do you think happens with these children? The undesirable behaviors often\nbecome exacerbated in frequency, form, and intensity. You would think this would\nbe a signal for some parents and professionals to reconsider, but unfortunately it\noften is not.\nHow can they get away with this? These advocates of non-consequence- based\napproaches will stipulate that their approach may not produce immediate gains to\nactual behavior. Rather, this \u201c enlightened\u201d method of handling the child\u2019s behavior\ntakes a long time to sink in, and therefore one should not be discouraged when the\nproblem behavior does not improve in the short-term. Of course to some of these\nexperts, short-term can be years (or decades)!\nIf this reminds you of the fable about the emperor\u2019s new clothes, it should. If\nyou get people to believe that anything that produces an immediate change in a\nchild\u2019s behavior as a result of consequences is harmful, they will see a dressed\nindividual when that person is actually naked. You might remark to yourself,\n\u201cCertainly, they will see the obvious.\u201d However, when you show them someone who\nis naked, their remarks astound you. \u201cOh, she only looks like she is naked. This is\nan illusion. If you could see like I see, you would see she has beautiful clothes on.\u201d\nThe analogy: You may think your child is doing better because his behavior is\nimproving, but deep inside the \u201cpsyche,\u201d he is all screwed up (you have to take their\nword for that).\nConcurrently, an intervention that is ineffective in the short run is a sign of good\nnews, to them. This means that this child will be a markedly better adult 10 years from\nnow, because he is obviously struggling with all this conflict. In other words, the\nopposite is true. These people will swear that they see clothes on someone who is\nnude. What is the upshot? Often, the clothes never arrive and many parents are\nduped into believing that the clothes were on their way. In truth, they never had\nmuch of a chance to arrive.\nLet me state emphatically, children like Johnny, who engage in such behaviors\nare in desperate need. These children need to develop more emotionally responsible\nbehaviors to the everyday demands from their environment. This behavioral\ndevelopment occurs when adults in the child\u2019s life provide consequences for both\nappropriate and undesirable behaviors. All the sophisticated theorizing in the world\nis not going to change Johnny\u2019s way of doing business if the social environment does\nnot consequate unacceptable ways of responding. If Johnny\u2019s mother would take the\nadvice of her friend, Johnny would learn that complying with the school rules and\nbeing respectful to school personnel produces dense and varied reinforcement.\nConcurrently, failing to do such would result in a less desirable set of circumstances.\nChildren learn by what we do. Exposing Myths About Punishment 59\nAs a side note to the dialogue above, did you note that suspension from school\nwas not an effective punisher of Johnny\u2019s oppositional behavior toward school rules?\nLet me pose some questions for you as food for thought. Why do you think that\nsuspension from school did not decrease Johnny\u2019s behaviors? What do you think\nhis mother does to him when he is suspended? What would her friend do if her son\n(Harold) were suspended? Does suspension function as a punisher for all children?\nWhat do you think must be in place if suspension from school is to effectively reduce\nthe behavior of children like Johnny? Would it be better for schools to intervene in\nother ways when suspension does not function as a punisher? For more information\non classroom contingency management, I would refer the reader to my book\n(Cipani, 2004) on the topic, Classroom Management for All Teachers: 12 Plans for\nEvidence-based Practice.\nWhen You Punish Children for a Behavior, Don\u2019t They Become\nUpset?\nHow many children cry when they are put in time-out? My answer is many.\nSome children also throw tantrums, can be aggressive and so forth. These reactions\ncan also occur for other punishing consequences, including the failure to earn points\ntoward a sizable reinforcer. Not all children engage in such behaviors; some children\nhave learned to accept these consequences. But a fair number of children do engage\nin crying and other forms of behavior indicative of discontent. This short-term\nemotional response does occur to the imposition of the consequence. Once the\nconsequence is removed, and the child returns to previous stasis, such behaviors\ndisappear.\nIf a punishment intervention produces such a short-term emotional response,\nis that a \u201cbad thing?\u201d Some professionals and parents apparently think so. Perhaps\nthey believe that children should always be happy and in perfect harmony with their\nenvironment. I guess we should only find out that life isn\u2019t perfect when we turn 18.\nBeing upset when you receive a consequence for misbehavior is natural. No one\nis happy when they lose extra recess, TV privileges, or a promotion at work. If that\nweren\u2019t the case, police officers that hand out tickets would be one of the most\npopular groups of people in the community. They would be invited to all types of\nsocial events and be asked to bring their ticket books in case someone at the party\nneeded a ticket. Upon receiving such, the recipient would thank the officer and\ninquire how she or he could receive another ticket.\nSarcasm aside, adults also often have short-term emotional responses to\ncontingent punishing consequences. In this regard children are no different. Some\nchildren are unhappy about receiving a punishing consequence and express such in\nthe form of crying. The first mistake is to assume this is anything more than a short-\nterm phenomenon. The second mistake is to make this reaction to the consequence\ndelivery the basis for why punishment is not desirable: Because he cries! 60 Section II\nAre These Reactions to Punishment Tough for Many Parents to\nHandle?\nYes! Many parents struggle with this issue. They have been told that the side\neffects of punishment such as crying, pleading, tantrums and other emotional\nresponses, are an indication of two undesirable phenomena. First, such reactions\nindicate that the consequences lack the ability to handle the child\u2019s behavior (wrong\non the first count). Second, it is evidence that punishment is undesirable as a method\nof dealing with child behavior (wrong on second count). Hence, parents see their\nchild cry upon the delivery of a punishing consequence and believe they are doing\nsomething wrong. They feel guilty and wish to apologize to someone for having to\npunish a child\u2019s behavior. Very often, parents utter the following infamous words,\n\u201cNow Johnny, this hurts Mommy more than it hurts you when I have to put you\nin time-out.\u201d I have seen parents sit with their child while she or he is in time-out,\nexplaining to the child how bad they feel because she or he is in time-out. One of\nmy behavioral specialists reported to me that one of the mothers she was working\nwith sat right next to her child and actually cried, with her child, when he was placed\nin time-out. How well do you think that time-out procedure worked for that family?\nWhat is the Result of this Parental Guilt?\nTo avoid \u201cprovoking\u201d the child\u2019s crying, some parents will infrequently\nconsequate problem behaviors, particularly in a systematic fashion. Because of the\nlack of systematic consequences, these parents fail to address effectively the problem\nbehavior in the first place. If a parent stops using time-out as a consequence, their\nchild will obviously not cry (because she is not in time-out). This is true. However,\nwhat does this do for her problem behavior (i.e., hitting her sister)? Infrequent and\ninconsistent consequences are usually ineffective, hence their failure to control\nundesirable behavior.\nIf on the other hand, these parents are taught that providing consequences for\nunacceptable child behaviors is not only an effective way to manage such behaviors,\nbut is justified, then they would feel less guilt. It is tough for almost all parents to see\ntheir kids cry. My mother had a great saying for that, \u201cBetter you cry now than I cry\nlater!\u201d Think about that. My mother was extremely astute, despite the fact she never\ncompleted high school (she grew up in the depression). I thank her everyday, and\nI am in her debt.\nIs There Any Research Evidence Regarding Positive Short-term\nEmotional Effects?\nAgain we have probably all witnessed children responding in an unhappy\nmanner to parent levied consequences. I do not deny that such phenomenon exists.\nI would contend that such a result in the beginning is not a bad thing. It is probably\nindicative of the consequence creating a condition that the child will wish to avoid\nin the future. Many children who experience time-out the first few times cry. I usually\ntake that as a sign: If time-out is implemented consistently, it has a good shot at\nworking. Exposing Myths About Punishment 61\nDoes outcome-oriented punishment produce undesired changes to other\nbehaviors or aspects of the child\u2019s emotional development? With regard to children,\nthere are just a few studies that have examined this experimentally (Lovaas &\nSimmons, 1969; Otto, 1976).\nIn his extensive nationally renowned work with children with autism, Dr. Ivar\nLovaas at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1969 found that punishment\nprocedures eradicated severe self-injury (Lovaas & Simmons, 1969). But he also\nnoted that some of the children became more socially responsive to the adults. For\nexample, John, an 8-year-old child with severe mental retardation, engaged in self-\ndestructive behavior since the age of 2. He would take his fist to his head, producing\ncontusions and bruising on his head. At the age of 7, after extensive attempts from\nJohn\u2019s parents to maintain him in their household, they had to place him in a state\ninstitution. When he was admitted to UCLA facilities, he had to be restrained\ncontinuously in order to prevent him from hurting himself.\nWhile I know some of you may cringe at reading this, in order to produce a\nsufficient consequence for such self-destructive behaviors, a one-second shock was\ndelivered when John attempted to injure himself. This obviously was under the close\nsupervision of clinical staff at UCLA. The effect was immediate; no more attempts\nat self-injury. Compare this with the years of parental efforts that resulted in the\nfailure to inhibit John\u2019s self-destructive behavior. Dr. Lovaas noted that in addition\nto his refrain from hurting himself, his whining behavior reduced noticeably.\nAnother positive side effect of this treatment was that John was increasingly\napproaching the adults involved in his treatment. Funny, \u201cpsychological theory\u201d\nwould have predicted that he would avoid these adults at all cost because they were\nassociated with punishment. Seemingly, the punisher produced positive benefits.\nCan you see why it is important to collect data instead of only speculating?\nUnfortunately, as you can readily see, the research base regarding the emotional\nside effects of outcome-oriented punishment is not extensive. One cannot conclude\nunequivocally that positive side effects always occur. We just do not know enough\nat this stage of research. Further, because of the prohibition on studying punish-\nment, it does not appear that we are on track to learn more about the side effects of\noutcome-oriented punishment to a child\u2019s emotional state. The overt and covert\nprofessional ban on such research has certainly contributed to such a lack of\nunderstanding, which is extremely unfortunate.\nDoes Aggression Beget Aggression?\nMany critics of physical punishment state that such procedures model aggres-\nsive behavior on the part of the parent and therefore make it more likely that the\nchildren will acquire aggressive repertoires themselves. To provide a factual basis for\nsuch a contention, animal research conducted in the 1960s showed that animals\nexhibit aggressive behavior when they are shocked (Azrin, Hutchinson, & Hake,\n1967; Ulrich & Azrin, 1962). If you teach a pigeon to peck a key to get food and then\napply shock to the pigeon for the key peck, it will aggress against the cage or another\nbird. Further, the same aggressive behaviors occur when you simply remove food 62 Section II\nreinforcement as the consequence of key pecking (Azrin, Hutchinson, & Hake,\n1966). In other words, presentation of a powerful consequence such as shock or the\nremoval of positive reinforcement has the same side effect: emotionally undesirable\nresponses (Azrin, Hutchinson, & Hake, 1966; 1967). Both the presentation of an\naversive event as well as the removal of reinforcement were equally adept at\ndeveloping this aggressive reaction.\nIs this not evidence that bad things can happen with punishment? Not exactly.\nIn these studies, such reactions to punishment were just allowed to occur, without\nany consequence. What if a consequence is delivered to the subsequent aggressive\nbehavior (i.e., punish the aggressive behavior)? Can aggressive behaviors occurring\nas a result of the punisher be eliminated through punishment contingencies applied\nto such behaviors themselves? Obviously this is an important issue. If a procedure\nthat solves one problem generates more problems, it certainly needs to be considered\na risky venture when intervening. Failure to find a mechanism that lessens or\neradicates the potential side effect of punishing consequences would certainly\nmitigate against its use.\nIn a study that examined that question, with three monkeys serving as\ninvoluntary participants, the monkeys were shocked every 30 seconds (Azrin, 1970).\nThe shock was not contingent (dependent) on any behavior. This noncontingent\naversive event produced the side effect of the monkeys biting a pneumatic tube\ninside their cage. Yes, monkeys get upset at being shocked! This tube automatically\nrecorded each bite, thus providing an accurate measure of aggression. As long as the\nbites went unpunished, biting the tube following the receipt of shock was a given.\nHowever, once a sufficiently intense shock followed each bite on the tube, zero or\nnear zero rates of biting the tube resulted for all three monkeys. Sure, the monkeys\nwere still frustrated, but they found another way to deal with such frustration.\nApparently, the type of emotional reaction to such an aversive event depends on the\nconsequence of the reaction. If the monkeys could talk, they might have told the\ninterviewer from CNN, \u201cBoy, I am mad, but I am not going to take it out on that\ntube.\u201d What a paradox; shock purportedly elicits such aggressive behavior but when\nit is used as a contingency it also eliminates aggressive behavior as a reaction to\nfrustrating events. Perhaps the method of handling inappropriate and undesirable\nreactions to consequences needs to be examined. I am not suggesting the method\nused in the study above, but an additional consequence does seem to be a possible\nfruitful approach.\nWhat is Your Best Guess about Short-term Side Effects of\nPunishment?\nI would venture to guess that positive side effects would occur if the change in\nthe child\u2019s targeted behavior was fairly dramatic. For example, if you change the level\nof sibling aggression in a family, would that not have an effect on how the two\nsiblings get along with each other? Further, with the increased positive relationship\nbetween the two siblings, the rate of their mom or dad intervening in a negative\nfashion would be less frequent. Do you suspect that the amount of positive attention Exposing Myths About Punishment 63\nand praise would also increase, given that more appropriate play between the two\nis now occurring?\nIn my clinical work, when a consequence is successful over a period of time in\nmodifying a problem behavior, effects to other areas of functioning have usually\nbeen positive. The case below is an illustrative example.\nThe Case of: \u201cI Grew to Love You.\u201d\nIt is always hard when young children are removed from their mother\u2019s\nhome due to no fault of their own. Such was the case in one of my referrals\nfor two sisters, ages 4 and 6, who were having extreme difficulty in their first\nfoster placement after being detained by Child Protective Services (CPS).\nThe foster mother, who had already raised her own children, did not know\nhow to handle the defiance and oppositional behavior that occurred\nsubsequent to their visits with their biological mother. The children\u2019s\nbehavior, in particular the older one, made this foster mother raise concerns\nto the social worker within a month of placement.\nThese two girls visited their mother weekly at the CPS facility. While\nthe girls would certainly enjoy the visit with their mother, leaving her was\nless than pleasant. Certainly in the beginning one would expect a great\namount of emotion from these two girls. However, what was becoming a\npattern was not solely an emotional response to a sad and depressing\nsituation.\nAlthea, the older sister, would become oppositional, scream without\nprovocation and engage in inappropriate verbal comments shortly after\neach scheduled visit with their mother. As soon as she would leave the room\nwith her mother, she would become short, snippy and rude to the foster\nmother, Ms. Holly. I am sure Althea hated to leave and maybe this was her\nway of telling people that she wanted to go home with her mother. Althea\nwould also attempt to enlist her sister, Maria, to help in the verbal defiance\nand oppositional attitude. She would attempt to make a pact with Maria for\nboth of them to misbehave after the visit. Anything Ms. Holly would say\nwould seem to provoke a negative defiant reaction from Althea. The first\nseveral visits were largely made up of a defiant response from the point they\nleft the CPS office to the time they got home and beyond. Ms. Holly might\nask Althea, \u201cHow was your visit with your mom,\u201d or \u201cHow did you like the\ntoys in the room?\u201d This would be met by some response along the following\nlines: \u201cI don\u2019t have to talk to you. I don\u2019t like this place. Leave me alone.\u201d\n(Insert a defiant attitude with that verbal response.) The social worker spoke\nto both girls about their situation and how it is important to get along with\nMs. Holly, because she is wanting to help both Althea and her sister.\nFurther, Ms. Holly was having difficulty with the children regarding other 64 Section II\nbehaviors at home as well. In other words this placement was not headed\nfor calm waters.\nThese types of situations are heart breakers for everyone involved.\nWhen you see kids crying because they can no longer stay with their\nmother, we all cry. Why should children pay the price for an adult\u2019s\nmistakes and shortcomings? But alas, that is the case. However, my job is\nto make the short-term living arrangement more comfortable for everyone.\nHaving the children bounce around from home to home, because of their\nbehavior, is not good for them irrespective of the rotten turn their lives have\ntaken. While I certainly felt sorry for them, it was very clear in my mind what\nneeded to be done in the short-term. I had to make this arrangement\nworkable for everyone, especially the foster mother.\nOne note needs to be made about this foster mother. She was one of\nthe most kind and considerate parents I have met in my years of providing\nin home behavioral parent training for CPS. I felt that any child would be\nlucky to have her as a parent. If Althea and Maria could not be returned to\ntheir mother for reasons beyond their control, I saw a bright future for them\nhere. With the cards they were dealt with in life, this would be making the\nbest of that situation.\nHow should we deal with this defiant behavior coming from Althea?\nI am sure that most people would think that a consequence for such\nbehavior is the last thing you want to do. Well it was the first thing I wanted\nto do. I developed a contingency plan to address the defiant behavior\ncoming right out of the gate, so to speak, following Althea\u2019s visit with her\nmother. I did not want her to get started with verbal defiance even before\nthey got in the car, which was often the case. I have learned that often, if\nyou break the chain of behavior right at the start, you generate a positive\nmomentum. This is what was needed in this situation. Therefore, if both\ngirls were able to come out of the office and behave in a reasonable manner,\nwithout being oppositional or defiant, they would earn a trip to MacDonald\u2019s\non the way home. The point at which Ms. Holly was to make the decision\nto award the MacDonald\u2019s trip was one block before reaching the fast food\nrestaurant. Subsequent to leaving the CPS facility, Ms. Holly drove a route\nthat would possibly end at MacDonald\u2019s. However, if any oppositional or\ndefiant behavior occurred either at the CPS facility, or en route to\nMacDonald\u2019s, then the route was changed at that point, with a verbal\nexplanation that they would not be going to MacDonald\u2019s because of the\ndisplay of undesirable behavior. In other words, the punishing conse-\nquence for such behavior was the removal of the preferred event,\nMacDonald\u2019s. This plan resulted in an immediate change in Althea\u2019s\nbehavior (as well as Maria!). How many times do you think Althea and\nMaria had to lose a trip to MacDonald\u2019s before she learned some self-\ncontrol and respect for her new caretaker? How about not even once! It does\nnot look like punishing consequences had an ill effect on their emotional Exposing Myths About Punishment 65\nlevel at that point. As a matter of fact, in my data gathering with Ms. Holly\nabout the effectiveness of the plan, she indicated that both girls loved the\ntrip to MacDonald\u2019s, and always looked forward to it. Fortunately in this\nparticular situation, the threat of losing the trip eliminated the target\nundesirable behavior rapidly.\nThis was the good news. The bad news was that this plan generated a\nsecond problem. Althea would refuse to leave when she was told it was time\nto go. This secondary problem was handled successfully by the use of a\ntimer to signal the end of the playtime on the playground and time to leave.\nMs. Holly was instructed to inform Althea that it was about time to leave.\nShe would also inform her that she was setting the timer for 5 minutes.\nWhen it rang it was time to go. Failure to leave the playground area\nimmediately would result in the loss of the next trip to MacDonald\u2019s. The\nplan worked wonderfully. In short Althea seemed amenable to the use of\ncontingencies in a very short period of time. Further it did not appear to be\nhaving an ill effect on either her or her sister. They were becoming more\ncaring and loving toward their new caretaker, not less, as some one would\npredict. As Forrest Gump would say, they were as happy as two peas in a\npod.\nTo handle tantrums occurring in the home a time-out procedure was\nselected. During the first 8 days of intervention with time-out, Althea went\nto time-out between 3 and zero times per day (actual data- 1,3,3,1,1,2,0,3).\nMaria had 4 time-outs across all 8 days. To make tantrum behavior even less\n\u201cprofitable\u201d for either Althea or Maria, I instituted the \u201cmarble jar\u201d plan.\nEach time either one went to time-out, a marble was dropped in the marble\njar. If either one reached three marbles, she would go to bed early. With that\nadditional contingency, neither girl went more than once to time-out in a\ngiven day. It was often the case that whenever I made a home visit both girls\nwould greet me at the door and say, \u201cI did not lose any marbles today/\nyesterday, etc.\u201d Once the first marble was dropped, they clearly learned to\ndemonstrate more self-control. The marble jar plan increased both girls\u2019\nself-control. Increased self-control may have also been facilitated via some\nlevel of competition between the girls to be the one with the least number\nof marbles on a given day.\nCompliance was also a problem in the beginning, and time-out was\nadded as a consequence for noncompliance when needed. Overall, time-\nout combined with the marble contingency was very effective in getting\nboth children (particularly Althea) to comply with instructions. Addition-\nally, both girls became more adept at accepting a consequence, rather than\nescalating into more severe tantrum behaviors. Further, despite my role in\nthe development and delivery of such consequences, both girls were usually\nexcited to see me on my visits. 66 Section II\nIn summary, the problem behaviors delineated in the original assess-\nment were no longer occurring at a level that could be considered\nproblematic. What is also important is that both these children, in my\nhumble opinion, grew to love their new mom. This was evidenced in many\nways, from the way Althea beamed when she brought home a good note\nfrom school to the way she always looked for Ms. Holly\u2019s approval. I do\nbelieve that addressing their problem behaviors by using consequences\naided not only with the remediation of these problems, but added a\nsemblance of \u201cfamily\u201d to this newly comprised family unit. Althea and\nMaria seemed to be happy living with Ms. Holly, as well as continuing to\nspend a weekday afternoon with their biological mother.\nSome people would have objected to the use of consequences for these\nchildren on the grounds that they have experienced considerable trauma in\ntheir lives (true), and that punishment can only add to that (totally untrue\nas is evident). I felt that consequences for these behaviors were the one clear\njustifiable thing to do. What do you suspect would have been the result if\nthe girls continued to be disrespectful to their new caretaker and engage in\ntantrum behavior and noncompliance? Do you think that would have\nmade them happy? Would it have made Ms. Holly happy? Would the girls\nhave developed a love and respect for Ms. Holly? If your answer is, \u201cYes,\u201d\nto any or all of these questions, you probably also believe that pigs can fly,\ndespite the incontrovertible evidence pointing to this absurdity!\n\u2022 Why was Althea being so oppositional in the beginning? How was that\nchanged with the behavioral plan?\n\u2022 Why would it not have been a good idea to ask Ms. Holly to \u201cride out\nthe storm?\u201d\n\u2022 Are the girls going to hold a grudge for the rest of their lives over Ms.\nHolly or myself?\nWill Use of Punishing Consequences Result in Damage to a Parent-\nChild Relationship?\nI believe that the above case demonstrates the fallacy of that supposition. The\nuse of outcome-oriented punishment only enhanced the girls\u2019 relationship with\ntheir foster mother. Some \u201cexperts\u201d claim that using punishment will cause your\nchild to withdraw from you. You, as the source of punishment, will be avoided;\nhence your relationship with your child will be impaired. While there are no research\nstudies that have addressed this potential side effect directly with children who are\nnot handicapped, anecdotal evidence and information make this highly unlikely. I\nwill plead my case. Exposing Myths About Punishment 67\nWhile it is often the case that our children do not thank us for consequating their\nbehaviors at the time of delivery, this is most often not indicative of anything other\nthan a short-term response. Most of you would report that when this happens,\nsometime afterward, your child comes out of her \u201cshell\u201d and begins treating you in\nthe same manner as before. Further, think back to when you were a child and\nteenager. I am sure you did the same to your parents when they presented\nconsequences for your behavior. You may have thought to yourself: \u201cBoy am I going\nto remember this for my entire life.\u201d Did you hold a grudge for your entire teenage\nlife? Anecdotally, it does not appear that the use of punishment produces long-term\navoidance of one\u2019s parents in the majority of people.\nAlmost all parents are the source of multiple reinforcers as well as punishment.\nWith babies, parents feed them, take care of them, comfort them, and play with\nthem. As they get older, parents care for them when they are sick, play with them,\ntake them places, and hug them. Who takes them to soccer practice, little league, art\nclub and band? Don\u2019t parents shower them with love and devote themselves to their\nchildren\u2019s welfare? If you select a few behaviors that produce punishing conse-\nquences, won\u2019t this be far outweighed by all the other positive time you spend with\nyour child? I know that for many, many parents the answer is a resounding \u201cYes.\u201d\nIt is therefore inconceivable to me that a parent who applies a consequence to\na teenager who comes home late one evening from curfew has done something that\nwill do irreparable harm to a child\u2019s love for their parent. I do not have any scientific\ndata to support my contention. But let me tell you that those who profess that\npunishment damages a parent-child relationship do not have any scientific evidence\neither. I do have evidence that using punishing consequences will effect the child\u2019s\nundesirable target behavior and not exacerbate it. On the other hand, not using\nconsequences and relying on the child\u2019s natural tendency to discover that misbehav-\niors are not in his or her long-term interests: where is that data?\nCan a Parent be Primarily Associated with Punishment?\nHighly unlikely unless all you do is deliver unpleasant events. For example, if\nyou were a nurse in a hospital and the only time a pediatric patient saw you was when\nyou delivered the \u201cyucky,\u201d medicine, then I can see you becoming someone who gets\npatients hiding in the closets. But if you also provide other things such as comfort,\nreassurance, kind words, food, and honor various requests as the attending nurse, I\ndon\u2019t think most patients would come out of the hospital despising the nurse.\nWhen effective punishment occurs, the child learns to avoid the punishing\nevent by doing what? By not doing the behavior that produces it! This can be\nillustrated in the following example. We all know that cars can get in accidents and\ncause injury. We have even seen car crashes and other severe accidents, possibly in\nperson and/or on TV. How come we still get in the car and drive off each morning?\nBecause of two things: the multitude of reinforcers available when you use the car\nand the ability of the driver to avoid getting in accidents by engaging in safe driving\nbehaviors. Would it not be conceivable that more people would avoid driving if on\na random basis their car\u2019s steering wheel would lock up (not as the result of what the 68 Section II\nindividual did) and smash into something? But that describes a random application\nof an aversive event; Not a punishment contingency. If you were told that your car\u2019s\nsteering wheel locks up whenever you turn it all the way to the right, you would learn\nto engage in driving responses that avoid performing that response. I am pretty\ncertain that the majority of drivers would continue using their cars, but would never\nturn the wheel all the way to the right. One can avoid punishing events by not\nengaging in the behavior that produces such.\nWhat Should Parents Keep in Mind When They Are Faced with\nSevere Reactions to Punishing Consequences?\nWe have a saying for parents when working with them on implementing a\nbehavior plan: \u201cWhen the going gets tough, stick to your guns.\u201d Do not judge what\nyour child says when you impose the consequence as evidence that you have\ndamaged your relationship. If you withhold outside privileges for the afternoon,\nyour child will certainly not thank you because you have their long-term best interest\nat heart at that point. Your child will tell you it is unfair, that they cannot wait to be\nout of the house, and a host of other hurtful comments. I am sure you can fill in\nplenty of examples from your own experience. Further she or he may go to their\nroom to sulk and discourage you from discourse for some period. This is not\nevidence that punishment contingencies are undesirable. Have patience. Things will\nturn around.\nAs I am sometimes on the scene when consequences are delivered, I have seen\nmany parents just wilt when their child screams hateful remarks to them when in\ntime-out. They turn to me and say, \u201cHe just said he hates me. Shouldn\u2019t I go in and\nreassure him that I still love him.\u201d My answer is always, \u201cYes, if you want him to make\nyou feel like dirt every time he is put in time-out, go in right now and reassure him.\nBy the way, have you noted that he only remarks that he hates you when you do\nsomething to him that he does not like. Why doesn\u2019t he say, \u2018I hate you!\u2019, when you\nare giving him a piece of pizza? However, if you want to wait to reassure him that\nyou love him after he has finished his time-out and is busy playing, I think that would\nbe a prudent choice on your part.\u201d\nI know it is difficult to hear and see the things children do when they have to\nundergo consequences not to their liking. But take heart for the long run. Remember\nthat you are also a source of reinforcement (love, support, and affection). This\nstalemate will not last. If you apply the consequence for a short period of time and\nthen bring back the opportunity to earn afternoon privileges the next day, they will\nwarm up to you again. You will be reassured that they still love you, but they also\nknow there are consequences for behavior and will now respect you. The previous\ncold shoulder your child gave you when she or he lost outside time will fade away\nonce she or he earns the privilege to go outside again, through acceptable behavior.\nHow Should a Parent Handle More Severe Reactions to Punishment?\nMany children simply cry when placed in time-out or loss of a privilege is issued.\nAfter a few applications, they learn to accept the consequence and move on with Exposing Myths About Punishment 69\ntheir life. However, some children up the ante. I would contend that such reactions\nto consequences are learned from the parent\u2019s reaction to such behaviors. At any\nrate, when these severe reactions to punishment occur, they can pose a problem.\nSome children can engage in a variety of behaviors that are intended to escape\nsuch situations. Screaming, kicking, yelling, profanity, and other undesirable\nbehaviors are intended to teach you two lessons: (1) stop this unpleasant event right\nnow and (2) don\u2019t even think about doing this again in the future. Of course,\nstopping the use of consequences because of the aggressive or defiant responses a\nchild exhibits is not the right thing to do. But that is what many people do because\nthey have been told that a child\u2019s discomfort is a sign that you are not being a sensitive\nparent. In these cases you are strongly advised to get technical assistance from a\nBoard Certified Behavior Analyst or BCBA. You can go to www.bacb.com for a listing\nof these people. This situation may be beyond the scope of most parents\u2019 ability to\nhandle alone.\nIs it Possible to Teach Children to Accept Punishing Consequences?\nHow does one change a child\u2019s behavioral reaction to consequences? A didactic\npresentation of the benefits of accepting consequences, while certainly appealing, is\nmost often ineffective with many children. We would all like to believe that telling\nthe child he should not kick the plants over on the way to time-out should be\nsufficient. However, it is often ineffective. The child only knows that the more havoc\nhe creates, the more perturbed his parent seems to get. The following case presents\na method to teach a child how to accept consequences.\nThe Case of: \u201cSo You Won\u2019t Take a Time-out.\u201d\nI was involved in a case of a 10-year-old child who was restrained daily\nby his mother. The restraint was typically around the mother\u2019s delivery of\ntime-out, which was a consequence for aggressive behavior and attempts to\ndestroy property in the home. Each day he would engage in aggressive\nbehavior toward someone in the house or would throw some object against\nsomething. Each time he would behave in this manner, his mother would\nsend him to time-out. Each time he was sent to time-out, he would fight\nback. Each time he would fight back she would restrain him until his time-\nout period was up. This was one tough lady, but unfortunately her\npersistence was not paying off. Her son did not appear to be profiting from\nthe time-out consequence, as measured by lesser occurrences of aggression\nand property destruction. Further, the ruckus surrounding the time-out\nconsequence did not appear to be improving. Each time-out resulted in a\nrestraint from his mother. Many children his age require time-outs. But very\nfew fight their parent (like he did) when it is time to go. What could I do\nto teach him to accept time-outs? 70 Section II\nThen it hit me. How about a consequence for being restrained (in other\nwords punish his unacceptable reaction to the time-out)? If he had to be\nrestrained because of his oppositional behavior, then the consequence of\nthat should be more than simply tiring his mother out. He apparently did\nnot seem to mind the tussle. The following additional \u201cback-up\u201d contin-\ngency was invoked for any instances where a time-out had to be enforced\nthrough a parental restraint: he would go to bed an hour early. If he\naccepted his time-out, he could have multiple time-outs and nothing more\nwould occur. However, fighting the time-out implementation and thereby\nrequiring a restraint would result in the back-up contingency- loss of a later\nbedtime.\nThe results were immediate. No restraints were required after the first\nfew days. We then attacked the frequency of the target behaviors in the same\nmanner, thus bringing the level of such behaviors to a low rate (eventually\nonly one- two per day). This strategy has proven successful with many other\nchildren since this case. It is imperative that children learn that these\nreactions to punishment will only bring more unpleasant consequences,\nand not their escape or avoidance of consequences for target inappropriate\nbehavior.\n\u2022 Was the restraining consequence effective in reducing the child\u2019s\naggressive behavior?\n\u2022 What usually happens when children protest (i.e., through their\nbehavior) going to time-out? Does this possibly explain why time-out\nis ineffective in such cases?\nAre Some Parents Just Not Able to Effectively Handle Their Child\u2019s\nSevere Reactions to Punishment?\nAbsolutely. I believe time-out procedures are very effective as an immediate\nconsequence for children under the age of ten or eleven. However, I have learned\nover 2 decades that some parents are not capable, physically and/or emotionally, to\nplace their children in time-out and keep them there until the crying and other\nbehaviors stop for some period of time. In these situations, I may find it necessary\nto just restrict the time-out to a set period of time (e.g., 2 minutes), irrespective of\nwhat the child is doing at the end. It is not because I deem this to be a more effective\napproach for the child than a response contingent release (to be discussed later in this\nbook). It is because I believe this approach has a greater likelihood of being carried\nout by the particular parent. In other cases, I do not even prescribe time-out because\nof my sense of the inability of the particular parent to effect it immediately and/or\nhandle the child\u2019s behavior while in time-out. Exposing Myths About Punishment 71\nIt is important for a parent to come to grips with the saying, \u201cKnow thyself.\u201d Will\nyou deliver the intended consequence? What will you do if your child refuses to go\nto time-out? If you sense that you may not be able to effect the plan you have\ndesigned, it might require that you develop an alternate plan. This is particularly\nrelevant around the child\u2019s reactions to the delivery of the consequence. Of course,\nif your child objects to virtually any loss of events, you may need to start somewhere,\npossibly with the help of a board certified behavior analyst. On the spot coaching\nand help may be what you need to teach you how to deliver on your warnings.\nIn some situations, with two parent households, I use the \u201cwait till Daddy comes\nhome,\u201d strategy. On occasion, one parent has an inability to effect consequences,\nwhereas the other parent is currently capable of presenting consequences to the child\nwithout much of a severe reaction. In these circumstances, when both parents agree,\nthe parent with less influence is backed up by the parent with greater control over\nthe child\u2019s response.\nThis strategy has been particularly effective in some families where the child\n\u201cwalks all over\u201d one of the parents (more often his/her mother, but not always). The\nparent who does not have control, gains control, by being \u201cbacked up\u201d by the parent\nwho has better control. Further, such a transfer of behavioral control occurs without\nthe mother having to physically intervene. Again, I would recommend that a family\nconsider getting consultation from a behavior analyst before implementing such a\nstrategy.\nDoes the Use of Punishment Cause Long-term Emotional\nConsequences that Impair the Individual When She or He Becomes\nan Adult?\nCan punishment of child behavior cause an individual to grow up and become\nan alcoholic? Clinically depressed? What about a mass murder? Well, Ted Bundy\nprobably was punished when he was a child and look what happened. There it is:\nproof positive that parents who use punishment will probably have a son like Ted\nBundy. If you are punishing your daughter, she will probably grow up to be a female\nTed Bundy.\nWhile many people see how ludicrous this link is, there are continuing efforts\nto link childhood events to adult maladies. Psychologists, sociologists, and forensic\nresearchers flock to prisons, juvenile halls, psychiatric hospitals, and other settings\nand try to find childhood experiences that some or many of the inmates or patients\nhave had. Once again, such correlation research does not allow one to conclude\ncause and effect. However, there is an additional problem with this type of research.\nSuppose a researcher finds that a group of prison inmates is twice as likely to have\nbeen punished with a paddle in comparison to a group of non-prison subjects. Does\nthat prove that paddling causes delinquency? Suppose the number of people in\nprison who have been paddled is 25%. This rate turns out to be twice that in the\ngeneral population, let us say 12.5%. However, even with that difference (assume\nthat it is statistically significant), what do we know about most of the people (75%)\nin the prison group? They were not paddled. If paddling causes delinquency, would 72 Section II\nthere not be a greater link between the two? How do you explain that 75% of the\nprisoners were not paddled as children? Furthermore, how do you explain that\n12.5% of the people who were paddled, in the non-prison population, do not\ncommit offenses?\nWhy is such correlation research inadequate for determining whether punish-\nment produces long-term effects on adult development? The previous point I made\nregarding the inherent inability of correlation studies to allow for cause and effect\nanalysis is still at the heart of the matter. Here again is the argument I pose. Suppose\nwe see that the use of some punisher (e.g., time-out) is linked with higher rates of\nmisbehavior in children. What this means is that children who have high rates of\nmisbehavior, however defined, also experience more time-outs. On the other hand,\nchildren with low rates of misbehavior have lower levels of time-out. If such a study\nexisted, its authors might conclude (erroneously) that there is a link between time-\nout and misbehavior.\nWhy does such a finding not allow one to conclude that heavier use of time-out\ncauses children to engage in greater amounts of misbehavior? Turn the statement\naround. Greater rates of misbehavior cause greater use of time-out. Can that make\nsense? Linking two variables together does not give the direction of the causal arrow.\nThe biggest predictor of problems in adulthood in my opinion, is the inability\nto develop appropriate social behaviors as a child. With what we know from\ncountless studies in behavior analysis, children who do not have such behaviors can\nacquire them, through contingencies and skill training. I would say that the presence\nof outcome-oriented punishment, along with reinforcement and skill training, are\nconditions that would make such human frailties less likely, although this is just my\nbelief (i.e., no data to support such).\nMyth # 4: Punishment Is Not as Effective as Reinforcement\nIsn\u2019t it Common Knowledge that Reinforcement Works Better than\nPunishment?\nYou probably hear this often. \u201cPunishment may work, but it is not as effective\nas a reward system. It is better to catch children when they are good and not to point\nout their behavior when they are bad.\u201d It is said so often that it is taken as fact. Where\nis the evidence that such a position is true?\nThere are many studies attesting to the efficacy of reinforcement procedures for\na variety of child problem behaviors. One can certainly conclude that reinforcement\nprocedures are effective. There are also many studies attesting to the efficacy of\npunishment procedures for a variety of child problem behaviors. Again, one can\nconclude that punishment contingencies are effective. Both sets of studies simply\ndemonstrate that certain contingencies work for certain problems in certain con-\ntexts. What about a study that makes a comparison between reinforcement and\npunishment? Exposing Myths About Punishment 73\nWhich would be more effective, giving points to students for following the rules\nof the class or removing points for not following the rules? Which would the students\nprefer, the reward or response-cost procedure? A research study examined these\nquestions during a math period in an elementary special education class (Iwata &\nBailey, 1974). In the reward condition, the 40-minute math class was divided into\nten intervals. For each interval during which the student obeyed the rules, she or he\nearned a token, with a maximum of ten tokens. Each student had to have at least six\ntokens in order to earn a snack. There was also a bonus day, with special reinforcers\navailable for the 3 or 4 students who earned the most tokens up to that time. In\ncontrast, the response-cost condition involved all students starting out with ten\ntokens. Each time a student broke a class rule, she or he would lose a token.\nWhich procedure was better for changing the level of rule violations? During\nthe baseline condition, with no consequence for following or not following the rules,\nthe rate of rule violations was 9% for the two groups of students. The rates of rule\nviolation dropped to below 1% for both groups. Additionally, with the implemen-\ntation of consequences, either reward or response cost, both procedures resulted\neventually in a doubling of academic output. Off task behavior also dropped from\nbaseline levels as well.\nDid the students prefer the reward approach or the response-cost approach? In\nthe last experimental condition of the study, the students could choose which of the\napproaches they wanted to be on each day. Four students consistently chose the\nreward, 5 chose the response-cost, and the remaining 6 subjects switched their choice\nat least once.\nFurther, the teachers\u2019 use of social disapproval remained about the same for\nboth conditions. This is important to note because the disapproval rate of the teacher\nwas not directly targeted. What can one conclude from these results? When powerful\nconsequences are at work, there is no need for frequent negative comments to desist\nin some behavior. The consequence does its job!\nIn the above study, no significant difference was found between reward and\nresponse-cost contingencies. Note that the reinforcer available was the same for both\ngroups; snack plus a surprise day. It apparently did not matter whether students\nearned points for following rules or lost points for not following rules, performance\nin both conditions was high. Reward was not better than response cost. This is the\nexact opposite of a myth perpetrated by many people who are unfamiliar with such\nresearch findings, as a personal story below illustrates.\nI was hired to provide four sessions of training to school personnel, consisting\nprimarily of school psychologists, special education personnel, and some school site\nadministrators. In the early part of the first morning, one of the participants raised\nher hand and indicated that she learned that positives and rewards are more effective\nthan taking away points for target misbehavior. She further claimed that there was\na lot of research to bolster that fact. I inquired where this research could be found,\nand she said that this was something that a professor in her teacher-training program\nhad said. I could not find tons of studies, nor could she, but here are some studies\nI did find. 74 Section II\nGetting results faster. Can the use of punishing consequences, in conjunction\nwith the removal of reinforcement, speed up the process of reducing a behavior? If\nsuch were the case, it would certainly provide a justification for the initial use of a\npunisher.\nB. F. Skinner (1938) conducted a study with rats that addressed the efficacy of\nusing punishment in addition to removal of reinforcement. Two groups of rats were\ntrained to press a bar to get food pellets; bar pressing behavior was maintained on\nan intermittent schedule of reinforcement. Not every bar press resulted in a food\npellet. Bar pressing became a frequent response under control of the food reinforcer\nfor both groups.\nIn the test condition, one group of rats underwent an extinction process, which\nis the removal of food reinforcement. Each bar press did not result in food. The\nelectronic machinery is very adept at insuring that bar presses no longer produce\nfood (unlike humans who make some to frequent mistakes, even after verbally\ncommitting to extinction). The second group also received no food for bar pressing,\nbut in addition each bar press resulted in the delivery of a punishing stimulus (you\ncan guess what that was by now). What were the results? Combining a shock\nconsequence with extinction produced faster and greater response reduction when\nboth consequences were in effect. Seems like two is really better than one.\nReprimands are needed. A study sought to answer the question of relative\neffectiveness of reprimands versus and all positive approach (Pfiffner & O\u2019Leary,\n1987). Students from first, second, and third grades, attending a remedial summer\nprogram participated in this study. All students were reported by the regular school\nteacher to be functioning below grade level in math and/or reading. Six of the 8\nstudents were also reported to have behavior problems, as measured by an often-used\nchild behavioral rating scale, filled out by teacher interview.\nWould a discipline program that revolves around all positive procedures be as\neffective as one that includes positive procedures plus reprimands for off task\nbehavior? The management system the teacher implemented in the all positive\napproach included the following: verbal praise, public posting of completed work,\nand earning of stars each hour for good behavior and engaging in academic work.\nThe stars were traded in for all types of activities and prizes on the reward menu. In\nthe combined approach, all the positive procedures were used, but negative\nreprimands for off task behavior were also implemented.\nIn order to determine the effectiveness of the all-positive approach versus the\ncombined approach, several measures of student performance and behavior were\ntaken throughout the study. The rate of accuracy of daily assigned math problems\nwas collected for each student in the study. Additionally, trained observers also\nmeasured the daily rate of on-task behavior.\nThe results revealed that the combined approach was superior to the all-positive\napproach for on-task behavior. Using only the all-positive approach, the mean on-\ntask rate across all students was 56%. The range of on-task behavior during this\ncondition showed great variability. The worst performing student\u2019s average on-task\nrate was 36%, while the highest performing student\u2019s average rate was 67%. During Exposing Myths About Punishment 75\nthe combination, the average rate of on-task behavior across all eight students was\nnow 80%. The worst performing student in this condition had a mean rate of 72%,\nhigher than what was obtained in the all-positive condition for the best student. This\nstudy certainly seems to support a contention that adding consequences for off-task\nbehavior in the form of reprimands improves what is achieved merely through the\nuse of praise and tangible reinforcers.\nIs the Intent of De-emphasizing the Efficacy of Punishment\nProcedures to Enhance more Positive Approaches for Dealing with\nProblem Behavior?\nI am not sure what is meant by positive approaches, in terms of effectiveness.\nSomething can look positive, but be completely ineffective. A car can be bright,\nshiny and look great, but sputter when driven over 30 miles per hour. What is an\nexample of this with respect to child behavior and parenting? A hypothetical Dr. Feel\nGood has written in her book that the best parenting approach to dealing with a\nchild\u2019s misbehavior at school is to discuss with the child, what their feelings and\nthoughts are regarding their behavior and its impact on the teacher\u2019s feelings. After\nsuch a discussion, the parent should \u201creach out\u201d to their child and tell her them that\nthey trust him or her to make the wise choice. Dr. Feel Good explains that a failure\nto trust your child to make good choices in life will upset the homeostatic\nrelationship that may exist, and your child will resent such lack of trust later in life.\nSound good? What parent would not like to be able to engage in such a positive\napproach to deal with presenting school behavior problems. While it looks great as\na parenting strategy, does it effect the child\u2019s rate of misbehaviors at school?\nIf you have watched TV sitcoms over the last 20 years, you are lead to believe\nthat this approach is the solution to all family problems. Open communication of\nfeelings and dialogue between parents and their children are the sole requisites for\nparents. On TV, it looks so appealing and effective! After such a dialogue, which ends\nin tears of love and joy from everyone, the child goes back to school, having gained\nperspective on her misdeeds, and becomes a straight A student. And all within 30\nminutes! Everyone would agree that such a manner of parenting would be preferable.\nWhile that certainly is appealing, suppose discussions with children about their\nbehavior do not lead to positive changes in their behavior at school. Some children\nkeep engaging in such misbehaviors at school. As the unacceptable behaviors\nbecome more frequent and severe, the result of continued problems lead to greater\ndisciplinary action on the part of the school. Again while this approach may appear\nto be the \u201chumane\u201d way of dealing with such problems, it unfortunately terminates\nin these children being expelled from school. I cannot view the repeated use of\npleasant but ineffective parenting methods as a constructive method for dealing with\nchild misbehavior. In my view, such a technique should be labeled, \u201cwell-meaning,\nbut disastrous.\u201d If you have to choose, would you choose looking positive or being\neffective?\nNow that I have clarified that point, back to the original question. If you\nprohibit the use of punishment procedures, would it naturally increase the use of 76 Section II\npositive reinforcement procedures? It seems to reason, if you remove one set of\nalternatives to dealing with behavior, the consumers of child discipline strategies\nmust select another. Therefore if people are told that punishment does not work as\nwell as reinforcement, wouldn\u2019t that force them to select only positive reinforcement\napproaches? Yes, I guess it might, possibly. Nevertheless, I have two concerns.\nFirst, the field of applied behavior analysis, which has been distinguished by its\nreliance on empirically validated approaches, would have to undergo a philosophi-\ncal transformation. It would have to become just another approach that promotes\ndogma in the face of contrasting evidence. This would not sit well with many\nbehavior analysts. These people consider themselves to be scientists who apply\nresearch findings to their work with people. To advocate that approaches to human\nbehavior be based on appeal rather than findings would (and should) be heresy.\nI believe it is perfectly all right to state one\u2019s preference. I prefer to use\nreinforcement procedures that also entail withdrawal of reinforcement for target\nbehavior problems. But I do not claim that other procedures that have an empirical\nbasis are not effective or are less effective.\nIf you prefer to address problem behaviors via the use of positive reinforcement\nprocedures, and are adroit and effective at doing such, then all power to you. But the\noperative requirement is success in changing relevant child behaviors. It is unaccept-\nable when important child behaviors do not change, irrespective of what interven-\ntion is applied.\nThe second concern regarding restricting use of certain punishers is that the void\nmay be filled by other procedures, such as an over reliance on medication to alter\nproblem behavior. Evidence of this possibility can be found in what has transpired\nover time when punishment has been restricted in certain government agencies that\nregulate human service fields. In fields such as developmental disabilities, that use\nbehavior analysis, certain \u201caversive\u201d procedures are prohibited while reinforcement-\nbased procedures are encouraged. Therefore, the contention was that restricting\ncertain aversive techniques in institutional settings would naturally strengthen the\nuse of reinforcement procedures. In a 1979 study, results showed that 50% of the\npatients in institutional settings for persons who have mental disabilities or mental\nretardation are on medication for behaviors (Aman & Singh, 1979). I would venture\na guess that this finding is still relevant for today. Has the restriction of punishers in\nthese institutions given rise to a greater reliance on reinforcement or medication to\nattempt to control certain problem behaviors? The answer seems obvious. Perhaps\nI can shed light on how this happens.\nGot Meds?\nI worked at two institutions for persons who are developmentally\ndisabled in Wisconsin between 1979-1981, fresh out of graduate school. I\nwas responsible for designing and writing behavioral plans for one residen-\ntial unit, comprised of adolescents and young adults. The Wisconsin Exposing Myths About Punishment 77\nstatutes regulating how I was to proceed in helping such individuals called\nfor review of my written behavioral plans. I do not want to spend time\ndetailing the entire statute so I will cut to the chase. If certain consequences\nwere used, it merely required that my immediate supervisor review them.\nThe \u201cturn around time\u201c was minimal at this level, perhaps 2-4 days. If other,\nmore intrusive, consequences were to be used, then the supervisor and the\ninstitution\u2019s human rights committee would have to review the proposed\nplan. Of course if they wanted something changed, it was sent back to me\nfor redesign and resubmission through the whole process. As you can see\nthe length of the process has been expanded by an exponent. I do not want\nto give the impression that every resident I dealt with required this lengthy\nreview. Many of the plans were exclusive of consequences that required\nsuch review. However, every so often, did I have a client with a problem!\nIn some such cases, the only recourse I could see at that time was that\nreinforcement would have to be combined with some aversive conse-\nquence.\nContingent on successfully surviving that process, the written plans\nthen had to go to a committee in Madison, Wisconsin for review. We are\ngenerally talking weeks, possibly over a month, before getting an answer.\nWhat was happening while all this review takes place? Back on the home\nfront, staff persons who had to deal with such unacceptable and/or\ndangerous behaviors would look for someone to provide them with help.\nOn my unit, as in others, we would convene meetings to determine what\ncould be done. They would turn to me, and inquire, \u201cDr. Cipani, what can\nyou offer us as a suggestion for when John Doe hits himself?\u201d My reply was,\n\u201cWell, I will have to collect data and then write a plan and then submit it\nto the process.\u201d They would politely reply, \u201cOK, we will certainly hold our\nbreath and wait for that.\u201d They would then turn to the institution\u2019s\nphysician in attendance (or his/her substitute, the nurse) and make the\nsame inquiry. Low and behold, this person would reply, \u201cWell I can\nprescribe ____ for such a behavior and see if that works.\u201d\nHold on here! Let us play that back in slow motion. If the staff of the\nfacility wanted behavioral plans, they had to wait some moderate to lengthy\nperiod of time for approval. However, if they were willing to go the\nmedication route, they would get an immediate response. My thought at\nthe time was, \u201cWhy is it I have to get everyone\u2019s permission to do\nsomething, and Dr. So and So consults himself or herself and then writes\na prescription.\u201d If you were in the staff\u2019s shoes, whom would you turn to\nin a pinch. Not me! I have a \u201csometime in February\u201d answer for you. Dr.\nSo and So can help you right away. Does restricting some forms of\npunishment lead to greater use of positive reinforcement? I\u2019ll let you be the\njudge, but I do not consider medication a contingent positive reinforcer. 78 Section II\n\u2022 What\u2019s wrong with this picture?\n\u2022 What can be done to make social interventions more prominent as a\nmeans to change child behavior?\nWhat Has Happened to Discipline in the Schools? Is There a\nGreater Reliance On and Use of Positive Reinforcement Procedures?\nIf the above example does not ring a bell, perhaps this one will. Where else is\nthis reliance on nonsocial interventions taking place? How many times have we\nheard that the use of medication for school aged children is on a significant rise? Take\nthis additional piece of information into account. Many school administrators and\nteachers report they have lost many of the discipline procedures involving conse-\nquences for problem behavior that were used decades ago. As the use of certain\ndisciplinary consequences has decreased over time, has the use of positive reinforce-\nment procedures increased? I don\u2019t think so. What apparently has filled the void\ncreated by prohibiting certain disciplinary tactics is more frequent contact with\npsychiatrists and pediatricians.\nThe field of applied behavior analysis has proven substantially, numerous times\nover, that reinforcement systems increase desirable behavior in children in class-\nrooms (Cipani, 2004). I can\u2019t fathom how this is even a debatable point. However,\nsuch reinforcement approaches are not used often for children having behavior\nproblems at school. Instead, a more frequent approach is for school personnel to\nsuggest to the parent that she get a doctor to prescribe medication. I have had a\ncouple of parents over the years tell me that such was a condition for the child\u2019s\nreturn to school from expulsion. In other words, the parent was told, \u201cWe will let Jose\nback to school if you agree to have him see a physician for medication for his\nbehavior.\u201d\nWhy Can\u2019t Reinforcement Procedures be Used Instead of (or in\nSupplement to) Medication for Behavior Problems in School?\nNothing physically prevents it. In some cases with school behavior problems,\nI have used behavioral contingencies in conjunction with medication, and in other\ncases, I have used behavioral contingencies exclusively. It can be done. What\nprevents more widespread use of behavioral contingencies in conjunction with\nmedication? Consider the following argument.\nMedication, once prescribed by a physician, does not require any special skills\non the part of the adult. One merely directs the child to open his or her mouth and\ninsert the pill or liquid. But such cannot be said for behavioral consequences.\nTherein lies the answer.\nI believe a greater use of behavioral contingencies in classrooms would solve\nmany of the problem behaviors that teachers face today (Cipani. 2004). While I\nwould like to see greater use of reinforcement procedures to increase appropriate\nbehavior and academic engagement in materials, such is often not the case. What few Exposing Myths About Punishment 79\nconsequences for misbehavior school personnel have at their disposal, they rely on\nfrequently, (i.e., calling parents, detention, principal\u2019s office, suspension, and\nexpulsion). However, a concomitant use of powerful reinforcement consequences\nfor on-task behavior is typically not deployed with these strategies. Why?\nMany university teacher-training programs, and their associated faculty, have a\ndisdain (and lack of skill) for behavior analysis procedures. Hence, their consumers/\nstudents do not receive adequate instruction on such. If one does not receive training\nduring professional preparation on such a technology, one would expect very few,\nif any graduates, to be capable of effectively using behavioral contingencies?\nTherefore, such future teachers ability to implement a behavioral plan based on\nreinforcement and punishment operations is handicapped in numerous cases,\nwhich brings me back to the original question. Can reinforcement be used in\nconjunction with medication? Yes, if the personnel have the capability to design and\nenact an effective plan. However, if such behavior analysis skills do not exist, what\nalternative becomes very probable when the behavior of the child is unmanageable,\nin spite of all the detentions and visits to the principal\u2019s office. Yes, you got it,\nmedication. How to improve this situation? Only skill training in behavior analysis\nfor all future teachers would have the desired effect.\nIsn\u2019t it Common Knowledge that Punishment Does Not Teach a\nChild a New Behavior?\nPunishment, or reinforcement for that matter, does not teach new behaviors.\nPunishment, like reinforcement, only alters a person\u2019s motivation to engage, or not\nengage, in a behavior that is already in the child\u2019s current repertoire. I often use this\nexample to illustrate this point to students in my class. I ask them, \u201cWho would be\nwilling to earn a trip to Hawaii, all expenses paid for one week, for performing a\nbehavior that would take no more than 30 minutes? It is not something that is illegal\nor would go against anyone\u2019s moral standards.\u201d Of course they all raise their hand.\nI then inquire, \u201cWould you all say that you are sufficiently motivated to respond to\nmy challenge?\u201d Again they all eagerly raise their hand. I then say, \u201cOK, let me give\nyou a test of 10 problems in the content area of integral calculus (please assume that\nstudents in the class may only have familiarity with basic Algebra). You have 30\nminutes to complete this test without referring to anyone or anything and if you\nscore a perfect 100% you earn the trip.\u201d\nWhile many students report they would try, all realize that they would probably\nnot be successful. A free trip to Hawaii would certainly get them to perform a\nbehavior that is in their repertoire, but it does not have such evocative effects when\nthe individual cannot perform the behavior. What is needed in such a case is good\nsolid instruction, along with reinforcement contingencies. Merely changing someone\u2019s\nmotivation to perform a behavior does not alter its probability if the probability is\nnull to start with. If someone were not capable of performing the target behavior,\nstrengthening the reinforcer and/or punishing contingencies would not be fruitful.\nReinforcement and punishment only makes behaviors currently in the repertoire\nmore, or less, probable. Neither operation, in isolation, develops new repertoires. 80 Section II\nTeaching Children How to Peacefully Co-exist with Pets\nI am not suggesting that one should always approach a problem\nbehavior with the intent to use a punishing consequence only. Far from it!\nThat is not the first thing that comes to my mind when I am faced with\ncertain problem behaviors. Here is a case in point. We have worked with\nseveral young elementary aged children whom I term: animal destroyers. For\nwhatever reason, these children abuse animals. Some children have broken\nthe legs of cats, grabbed dogs by their ears, or engaged in other similar abuse.\nIn some cases, prior to our involvement, these children have received\nindividual psychotherapy. Such therapy was provided to find out why the\nchild was hurting an animal, and what in their psyche could lead to such\nan exhibition of violence. Individual therapy is based on the premise that\nthe child needs to gain insight into his internal conflicts. When individual\ntherapy only resulted in continued aggression to animals, in addition to\nother behavioral problems, we would get the referral for behavioral\nmanagement. I\u2019ll leave it to you to speculate how much insight these\nchildren gained up to the point when we initiated skill training and\ncontingencies.\nWe have found it essential in these cases, especially with young\nchildren, to use a double pronged approach: Teach these children how to\nplay with animals safely and punish any behavior that involves inappropri-\nate contact quickly. For the former, we often start with getting the child to\nengage in hugging and petting stuffed animals, under close supervision. We\nshow them how to pet the animal and then ask that they rehearse the\ndemonstrated behaviors under our guidance. Our basic instructional\nprocedure is to: (1) tell the child what to do, (2) show the child how to do\nit, (3) have the child rehearse the behavior we just modeled for them, and\n(4) give the child feedback on their performance.\nImmediate correction of incorrect imitations of our modeled behav-\nioral response is given in the beginning. Subsequent to the first few\ncorrections, a mild punishment contingency is put into effect. Any\ninappropriate contact results in removal of the stuffed animal for a short\nperiod of time. Following this, we present continued practice on stroking\nthe animal instead of choking it, hurling it across the room, or whatever\nother violent behavior may be the child\u2019s modus operandi with real\nanimals.\nOnce the child learns to pet and play with the stuffed animal over two\nto three sessions, we then bring in the real animal. Under close supervision,\nthe child is prompted to engage in the same acceptable loving behaviors.\nIt is important to restrict the child\u2019s access to real animals as much as\npossible at times other than the training sessions in the beginning. Once the Exposing Myths About Punishment 81\nparent and we feel comfortable with their child\u2019s demeanor toward the\nanimal, we provide greater access.\nDuring this training, if the undesirable behavior toward the pet occurs,\nwe immediately remove the child from the animal and place him or her in\na time-out. Additionally, depending on the age of the child, we may also\nhave a 1- to 2-day restriction from contact with the family pet for that child.\nAfter several sessions of appropriate supervised contact we then let the child\nhave full access with this caveat: even attempt to be \u201cmean\u201d to the animal\nand you will pay the price. We have seen several children with this problem\ngrow to have appropriate relationships with their animals and really\nappreciate their pets as animals with feelings. But it takes skill training and\ncontingencies. Simply scolding the child, as a strategy to deal with animal\nabuse, in our experience, does not appear to be effective in the long run.\n\u2022 Why was it essential to begin training with stuffed animals instead of\nreal pets?\n\u2022 What was the consequence for undesirable behavior toward a pet?\nWhy do you think this was not carried out prior to my intervention?\n\u2022 What is your theory about why some children engage in hurtful and\ndangerous behavior with their pets?\nDoes That Mean That Consequences are Irrelevant When Teaching\nChildren Something New?\nQuite the contrary. Make no mistake! Both skill training and consequences are\nneeded when teaching a new behavior. As I pointed out above, consequences will\nnot build in a behavior that is nonexistent. In order for consequences to work the\nbehavior must already be in the child\u2019s repertoire. For example, in the animal\nlaboratory, teaching procedures, called shaping, are used to teach the rat to press the\nbar or the pigeon to peck the key. You cannot simply place the animal in the cage\nand wait for him or her to bar press and then reinforce. Believe me, you would grow\nold waiting and the animal would probably starve. But once the animal is taught to\npress the bar (i.e., happens at some minimal rate), such behaviors will not become\nfrequent without consequences.\nLet us say that you see a need to teach your son how to play cooperatively with\nhis older sister. When they are on the swing in the backyard, he has resorted to\nthrowing her off, pushing her off, and grabbing her hair. All these unacceptable\nbehaviors are actually very adaptive at getting the desired result. It is funny that many\nprofessionals in the field call these behaviors, maladaptive. They ought to see how\nuseful they are in those situations in which someone is occupying the same space as\nyou desire. 82 Section II\nBut let us get back to the issue at hand. One day you provide repeated practice\nat getting the children to take turns with the swing, using a strategy comparable to\nwhat was described earlier in this book\u2019s introduction with the children at Head Start.\nToward the end of the day, they both seem to understand that they should come to\nyou, and you designate, via an oven timer, who goes on the swing first, for how long,\nand so forth. You are smart not to let the same child go first each time but rather you\nalternate. You feel success, and you are proud of your children and yourself. Finally,\npeace will come to your home when the children are out playing.\nThis idyllic lifestyle will persist only for so long. When one of them engages in\nthe previous adaptive behavior such as pushing, what are you prepared to do? Just\ngive them a lecture about how they are to get along with each other? That would\nprobably not be fruitful. On the other hand, if you consequate such behavior, with\nloss of access to the swing for some time, you have now made such behavior\nmaladaptive and less likely. Skill training will have a greater effect when it is backed\nup with congruent consequences. Believe me, this applies even to adults.\nIf you teach your child that pushing someone off the swing is inappropriate, by\nteaching him how to wait his turn, then you must back that up with consequences.\nWhen he waits, he gets to enjoy the swing. When he does not wait, he loses access\nto the swing. Now which behavior is adaptive? Which is maladaptive? Skill training\nand consequences- the only way to fly!\nAre There Any Studies That Have Used a Skill Training Approach\nwith Consequences?\nIf you go out shopping on a regular basis, you probably have been horrified by\nwhat you saw some children exhibit while there with their parents. In the 1970s, the\nFamily Training Program, under the Department of Human Development and\nFamily Life at the University of Kansas, was available to parents to help them deal\nwith child problems at home and school (Barnard, Christopherson, & Wolf, 1977).\nThese researchers verified the need for child behavior management during shopping\ntrips by interviewing store managers and mothers. The objective of a child behavior\nmanagement training package would be to decrease the following two inappropriate\nchild behaviors during shopping trips. First, the child should not be far from the\nparent and shopping cart. This was defined as being further than arms reach from\nthe cart. Second, the child should not handle or disturb any of the products on the\nshelves or floor area without authorization. An independent observer who accom-\npanied each mother recorded how frequently such target behaviors occurred.\nTo teach each child, appropriate behaviors were described and modeled by the\nresearchers and the parent. The child was given an opportunity to practice such\nbehaviors. Such skill training and verbal explanation of the types of behaviors\ndesired is an essential component of the management effort. However, when only\nskill training is provided, in the absence of consequences implemented during the\nreal-life condition, change in child behavior may not be realized.\nThe intervention also consisted of a reinforcement plan for appropriate\nshopping behaviors as well as a response cost for target behaviors. Each of the three Exposing Myths About Punishment 83\nparticipant mothers was taught how to reward appropriate behavior. They were\ntaught to provide points, about two to three times per aisle, for appropriate behavior\nas well as how to remove points for engaging in either of the undesirable target\nbehaviors (i.e., the response cost component). The balance of the points was\ncombined with other points earned for behavior at home. The child exchanged\npoints for items and privileges in the home.\nThe three boys who were the subjects of the study (ages 6, 6, and 5) all improved\ntheir shopping behaviors tremendously. As an example, Barney was away from his\nmother and the cart 49% of the time prior to the behavioral plan being implemented.\nWhen his mother reinforced proximal behavior and punished leaving the immedi-\nate area, his rate of being away from the cart dropped to 5%. Similar effects were\nobserved for the other children and for product disturbance as well.\nAs you might guess, each mother rated her child\u2019s behavior as markedly\nimproved subsequent to using the behavior plan. For example, during baseline,\nBarney\u2019s mother rated his behavior during three of the five shopping trips as poor.\nIn contrast, Barney received an excellent or satisfactory rating from his mother on\n15 of the 18 visits following implementation. Only three of these visits were rated\nas poor. Complaints about the child\u2019s behavior also decreased.\nBut there are some additional important findings of this study. Audiotapes of\nBarney\u2019s shopping trips were collected and scored by individual judges to determine\nif the use of the intervention package effected parent-child interactions. The\npercentage of positive and negative interactions across baseline and treatment is\ngiven below (neutral interactions are not delineated in this data).\nInteractions Baseline Treatment\nPositive 8% 66%\nNegative 33% 7%\nNote that Barney\u2019s mother infrequently engaged in positive interactions with\nBarney during baseline. An old saying comes to mind, \u201cIt\u2019s tough to remember to\nswim in the pool when you keep having to fight off the alligators.\u201d She also spent\nmore time in negative interactions with Barney. (What a surprise!)\nOn the other hand, note what happened to parent-child interactions when the\nintervention is in place. Negative interactions go way down and positive interactions\ngo way up. Again, what a surprise. I thought the experts said that if we use\npunishment, that we are breaking the bond of love between parent and child.\nAccording to them, shouldn\u2019t Barney resent his mother\u2019s authority?\nCould it be that when a parent is effective in managing their child, that all kinds\nof positive interactions can take place? The use of powerful consequences can make\nunpleasant situations more pleasant. Ask parents if it is easier to \u201cbond\u201d with their 84 Section II\nchildren when they are respectful of designated rules about behavior. It is my\ncontention that the effective use of consequences, punishers included, intensifies\nthe quality of a relationship, not diminishes it.\nI want to make one last point about these data. Does it not point to the blunder\nof examining correlation research data to determine whether parents who use\n\u201cpunitive looking\u201d discipline techniques are the cause or the effect? Did Barney\u2019s\nbehavior have something to do with his mother\u2019s mood and verbal behavior? When\nBarney was misbehaving more frequently, what happened? Parental negative\ninteractions go up. When Barney behaved more appropriately, what happened with\nhis mother. She spent way more time being pleasant. Using consequences seemed\nto have nice side effect for Barney and his mother.\nIf you surmised that Barney\u2019s mother was a mean and vindictive person, as the\nbaseline data might suggest, you might be erroneous. If an effective manner of\nhandling children is present, many mothers and fathers would probably be less\n\u201cpunitive looking?\u201d Even skilled people can be at a loss about how to handle some\nchildren, until a systematic plan using consequences is drawn up, as the case below\nillustrates.\nThe Case of: \u201cOne More Strike and You Are Out!\u201d\nGrandmothers raising their children\u2019s kids are an ever-increasing\nfamily dynamic. At a time in their life when they deserve a rest, some people\nare raising children they may not be able to keep up with. It is an all too\ncommon situation that my behavioral specialists and I have faced. We have\nworked with some grandmothers who had care taking responsibilities for\nmultiple children from two different daughters. Many times, their daugh-\nters, who were often on drugs habitually, get pregnant. While still taking\ndrugs they gave birth to the child, and then either voluntarily or sometimes\ninvoluntarily give the child to their mother to raise. Unfortunately they\nthen replicated the process. The worst case we have run across was a\ngrandmother (her husband had passed away) in her 70s raising 12 children,\nfrom two daughters. I could not comprehend how anyone, even in great\nathletic shape, could effectively manage that situation. She needed more\nthan behavior modification for her grandchildren!\nWe were referred two children from county mental health who were\nbeing cared for by their paternal grandmother, Mikki. Mikki had experience\nwith difficult children, having worked in group homes for a while.\nHowever, she appeared to be unprepared to effectively deal with her two\ngrandchildren, particularly Antonio, a 10-year-old boy with serious prob-\nlem behaviors. Antonio\u2019s social worker referred him for behavioral services.\nHe had been in counseling before, but no effect was observed on his\nbehavior at home and school. Exposing Myths About Punishment 85\nThe county department of mental health was even considering\nproviding an aide for his waking hours, to keep tabs on him. When the\nreferral was made to me, I requested one month to make headway. If my\nbehavioral specialist and I could not bring the level of some of his\nbehaviors down, we agreed to transfer the case to whomever mental health\nwanted to assign.\nThe referral information indicated that Antonio had problems with\ndisrespect toward adults, problems at school, and a negative attitude. In\nfact, he was having extreme difficulty in an after-school program, where he\nwas expelled previously and was admitted back after some persuasion on his\nbehalf by county social workers. Upon our entering the intervention phase,\nhe continued to engage in undesirable behaviors in this after school\nprogram. He currently had \u201cfive strikes\u201d in this program. A strike represents\n3 incidents of disruptive and/or inappropriate behavior in a single day.\nUnfortunately for us, his next 3 incident day would be his last strike.\nBut Antonio\u2019s behavior in the home also needed our immediate\nattention. Any parent will tell you that siblings argue. Unfortunately,\nalmost all parents have ascribed this as a fact of nature. But in some families,\nthe rate and intensity of the arguments is substantial (does the phrase\u2014 fight\nlike cats and dogs bring to mind a picture). Parents feel that they spend all\ntheir time presiding from one argument to the next. If you add in physical\naggression as part of the complex, arguing can be a back breaker on some\nor many days, as it was in the present case.\nSimply asking Antonio and his sister to stop arguing, separate them,\nand intermittently send them to their rooms did not work. The previous\nstrategy to deal with arguments was to figure out who started the argument\nand why. This strategy often led down the path of no return. Our analysis\nfound that in this case, like many others, it took two to tango.\nThe plan for addressing this interlocking dynamic was to count each\nargument against both children, not attempting to find out who started it.\nAn argument required both to say something to each other in a negative or\nderogatory tone. Then, we taught the grandmother how to use early\nbedtime as a contingency for unacceptable levels of arguing on a given day.\nYes, Virginia, when children are to go to bed is a parental prerogative. If it\nis a parental prerogative, it can be a privilege that is earned. This may be\ncounter to what some experts have told you, but it is a privilege. Also,\nsending children to bed early as a consequence for their behavior during the\nday will not cause them to become teenage psychotics. You can see below\nwhat it did for Antonio.\nDuring a 1-week baseline period (see first column above), Antonio and\nhis sister argued on the average of three times per day (with a high of five\nand a low of one argument). The initial period of intervention stipulated an 86 Section II\nAverageFrequencyofArguingAcrossBaseline\n&ConsequenceTimePeriods\nearly bedtime consequence for arguments at or above 3. In our contingency,\nif Antonio and his sister had 2 or fewer arguments in a given day,\nBaseline 3/8-17 3/18-27 3/28-4/12 4/13-19 4/21-5/4 5/5-14\n3.0 1.5 .75 .50 .25 0 0\nthen they both went to bed at their normal 8 o\u2019clock time period. Note that\nin the first two-week period (3/8-3/17), the average daily rate of arguing was\n1.5. This translates to the two children rarely having three arguments,\nbecause you know what kicks in if that happens. The period from 4/21- 5/\n14 did not have one incident of arguing behavior. There are not too many\nfamilies that can boast that, let alone children who were previously\nexperiencing severe difficulty in dealing with each other without taunting\nand arguing. It is amazing how much self-control two children, who\ndisplayed little control over their emotions previously, can have when you\nwield a powerful consequence.\nWith arguing at an extremely reasonable level, we decided to use the\nsame consequence for problems at the after-school program. Instead of\nwaiting for Antonio to reach three incidents, which would have been too\nlate, we set up an early bedtime contingency (for him only) if one incident\noccurred that day. Remember, he had five strikes, so we could not afford\nanother strike without risking his expulsion from this program. Since\ninception of this program Antonio did not receive another strike for the\nremainder of the school year. You can say that Antonio likes to stay up late.\nWhat could have been a disaster turned out well in the end. No physically\npainful consequence was needed, nor was a one-on-one aide for all his\nwaking hours required. Just control bedtime!\n\u2022 Why do you think a bedtime contingency was so effective in this case?\n\u2022 Is it a principle of \u201chuman nature\u201d that siblings have to fight with each\nother?\nMyth # 5: Time-out Does Not Work\nWhy is this a Myth? Exposing Myths About Punishment 87\nWhile the popularity of time-out is widespread, it is often misused by parents\nto modify child behavior (Cipani, 1999). Everyone claims to have used time-out, and\nmany report it does not work. Why would the results of parents\u2019 everyday use of time-\nout be in stark contrast to the result obtained in numerous research studies? Perhaps\nthe following can be instructive in that regard.\nI watched with interest one day when a TV newsmagazine show was covering\nchild problem behavior and a \u201cnew\u201d technique to deal with it. Incidentally, I had not\nseen any research supporting this new technique. The TV program had several\nparents being interviewed, accompanied with video-clips of their families in chaos.\nOne of the parents claimed that she had tried everything and nothing had worked.\nThe reporter asked her about time-out and she mentioned that her use of that did\nnot work either. The TV program then showed videotape of her and her child as a\ngraphic depiction of what goes on in her house. This boy engaged in a number of\nproblem behaviors such as disobedience and inappropriate social behavior towards\nhis sister. At one point he hits his sister, and as I recall, the mother made some remark\nlike, \u201c Why did you do that?\u201d\nNow remember, this is someone who claims that time-out does not work for her\nchildren. Is she under the impression that uncovering the reason why a child would\nhit his sister is a better strategy? If she had not been identified earlier in the video as\nthe parent, I would have assumed she was part of the TV crew, just watching this child\ngo from one incident to the next.\nI have a news flash: In order for time-out to \u201cwork,\u201d you have to use it! Was she\nwaiting for homicide to occur before issuing the proclamation \u201cOK, Bobby, you\nkilled your sister, now you must go to time-out.\u201d I have always wished they would\nhave me critique these parenting efforts and then with parental consent, show these\npeople how to use consequences. Time-out is certainly one of the most heavily\nresearched child behavior management techniques. When time-out has been\napplied correctly as a behavioral contingency, the results have been impressive.\nAn example of one such pioneering study was conducted in the mid- 1960s\n(Zeilberger, Sampen, & Sloane, 1968). It was a landmark study for several reasons.\nFirst, consider that the standard treatment of child problem behaviors is to have the\nparent(s) come to a professional\u2019s office. The parent and/or child meet with the\nmental health professional, usually once a week and then go back home until the\nnext appointment. Professionals who work with parents in their home, especially in\nthe 1960s, were about as common as a meteorite landing on a school bus in a major\nU.S. city.\nRory had been a problem child in his preschool class as well as at home. He\nengaged frequently in screaming, fighting, disobeying adult instructions and bossing\nother children around. Rory was 4 years, 8 months old, with an average IQ. The\nresearchers taught Rory\u2019s mother how to respond to specific problem behaviors\nthrough a designated consequence. The target behaviors selected for a time-out\nconsequence were (1) aggressive behavior in the home and (2) disobedient to\nparental requests or instructions. The time-out room was one of the family bedrooms 88 Section II\nthat was modified for purposes of deploying a time-out. Toys and other items were\ntaken out of this room. Seven of the 12 steps of the time-out procedure taught to his\nmother were the following, contingent upon the occurrence of a target behavior:\n1. Stating the target misbehavior immediately to Rory. (e.g., \u201cYou cannot\nfight.\u201d)\n2. Placing him in the time-out room swiftly and without conversation\n3. Setting a timer for 2 minutes and requiring him to sit in the time-out\narea for the entire 2 minutes\n4. Leaving him in time-out until tantrum behavior desists for a 2-minute\nperiod\n5. Ignoring other undesirable behaviors that are not aggressive or\ndisobedient\n6. Rewarding Rory when he obeys parental requests\n7. Providing special treats for Rory after periods of time when he engages\nin desirable play\nNote that the mother was required to leave Rory in time-out if crying or a\ntantrum episode occurred prior to the end of the time-out. An episode of tantrum\nbehavior required her to reset the timer for the full 2 minutes. He had to stay in time-\nout that much longer. Every instance of crying or tantrums in time-out only delayed\nhis release from time-out. Further the mother was also taught to supplement the\npunishing consequence with reinforcement for appropriate play and following\ndirections.\nTime-out was very effective. Prior to the use of time-out, the rate of aggression\non some days reached a high of 13 incidents. Following the mother\u2019s use of time-out,\nthe rate of aggression dropped considerably. After a rocky first 2 days, all subsequent\ndays using time-out as a consequence had either zero or one occurrence of target\nbehavior per day. Effects to Rory\u2019s instruction following behavior also showed the\nsame dramatic change.\nThese findings are illustrative of what often happens when a parent uses time-\nout. The first few days can seem worse than before. However, in many cases, once\nthe parent gets over the hurdle of the first few days, time-out is rarely needed. This\nis the mark of a powerful consequence: it does not need to be implemented that\noften. The child learns to not engage in the target behavior. Hence the need for\nimplementing the consequence becomes markedly lessened.\nThis difference in the level of target behavior is usually quite noticeable. What\ndo you think a day feels like when Rory is aggressive 13 times? How different do you\nthink the household is when he is only aggressive once (and goes to time-out)? What\nabout when he is not aggressive at all and follows the majority of his mother\u2019s\nrequests? In our clinical use of time-out with many families, we have noted a\nsubstantial change in the home atmosphere. Things are much calmer, once problem\nbehavior is reduced to lower levels. It is probably not healthy for parents or children Exposing Myths About Punishment 89\nto live in environments that require frequent confrontations between the two. With\ntime-out, my observation suggests that the child often learns what his or her role is\nand what behaviors are and are not permitted. This makes for a happier home for\neveryone.\nWhen Should Time-out Be Used?\nIf one is removing a child from an activity as a contingency for a problem\nbehavior, the removal from that activity must constitute removal from reinforce-\nment. Simply removing a child from an activity, without understanding whether the\nchild finds such an activity inherently pleasing at the time may backfire.\nLet us say we have several children who despise math class. The teacher decides\nthat whomever talks during study time will go to time-out. After three days of this\ncontingency, many children are frequenting time-out regularly during math. It is not\nhard to figure out what has happened. Is time-out during math the consequence that\nwill motivate children not to talk during this period? No, it will have the opposite\neffect; it will teach children to talk, and subsequently avoid studying. Why? Think\nabout it, which is more preferable to some students, doing nothing or doing math\nwork?\nIf the context within which one uses time-out were different, the results would\nbe different. Suppose the context is outside recess, and the recess supervisors want\nto reduce the number of times children throw things outside the school fenced\nproperty (on to the street). Do you think a 5- to 8- minute removal from recess will\nhave an effect? What kid does not like recess? Only kids who abhor recess would\npossibly not be affected by such a contingency. Do you see the distinction? Use of\ntime-out for target behavior during math facts would probably be ineffective. Using\ntime-out for problem behavior during recess would probably be effective. By the\nway, in order for this to work, recess personnel have to be adept at catching most\noccurrences. Lack of consistency would lead to lack of results.\nWhat can be done to insure that time-out does not exacerbate the target problem\nbehavior? My suggestion to parents; look and see what is going on when the child\nis in time-out, and what is going on when the child is returned from the time-out.\nIn my many years of using time-out I have always been encouraged when a child\nplaced in time-out began to cry. Do not misinterpret this. I do not enjoy seeing\nchildren cry. Rather, this was a signal to me that the child was leaving a preferred\nactivity and being moved to a less preferred event, time-out.\nAre There Any Children Who Love Time-out?\nChildren can love time-out if it constitutes removal from an unpleasant\nenvironment. Determining if removal from an activity constitutes removal of\nreinforcement is necessary for time-out to be effective. The removal from a non-\nreinforcing environment has disastrous results on child behavior (Solnick, Rincover,\n& Peterson, 1977). In this study, the researchers began by using a time-out\ncontingency for tantrums in a six-year-old girl with autism. However, what resulted\nwas probably unexpected. Time-out was not just ineffective at reducing tantrums, 90 Section II\nbut tantrums actually increased. Time-out was not a punishing consequence in this\ncase. Rather, time-out served as a reinforcer for tantrums, increasing their rate.\nHow could this be? As you may now know, time-out does not always function\nas a punishing consequence. Solnick and colleagues took this opportunity to\nuncover some basic principles in how time-out works. They noted that the girl would\ngo to time-out and then engage in self-stimulatory or ritualistic behavior, repeatedly\nweaving her fingers in a pattern. During instruction, this type of ritualistic behavior\nwas obviously discouraged. So it became an easy choice for her of where to be if one\nwanted to engage in such behaviors: time-out. She learned that a tantrum resulted\nin her removal from the instructional task, which was probably not high on her list\nof things to do. Further to add icing to the cake, she is placed in the time-out area,\nwhere she could entertain herself to her hearts content. Could this have been the\nfactor responsible for time-out not working in her situation?\nScientists prefer evidence to speculation. To test this hypothesis, the researchers\nimplemented two more time-out experimental conditions with this girl. Suppose she\nis sent to time-out but then physically prohibited from engaging in self-stimulatory\nbehavior. Would time-out regain its ability to punish behavior like so many other\nstudies have shown? To test this, in one experimental condition such ritualistic\nbehaviors were restrained immediately. In the other experimental condition the\nchild was not restrained from engaging in the ritualistic behavior during time-out.\nAs you can imagine, if going to time-out meant free access to hand weaving, then\nthis girl was apparently all in favor of going to lots of time-outs. However, if going\nto time-out meant that she could not engage in such behavior while there, time out\nlost its appeal to her. When ritualistic behavior in time-out was restrained, the rate\nof tantrums was reduced to zero on four of the six sessions. When time-out did not\ninvolve restraining her from engaging in ritualistic behavior, tantrums were far more\nfrequent. When time-out spelled free access to hand weaving, she had 16 trips one\nday to the \u201cland of pleasure\u201d.\nIn short, time-out may not be effective if the child can engage in a preferred\nactivity that she or he can only do when in time-out. Additionally, time-out is also\nineffective if it provides an escape from an unpleasant activity (such as chores or\nhomework assignments). If you are given a task that you absolutely hate, behaviors\nthat produce temporary removal of the task become more probable. For example,\nif your boss delineates a contingency between some behavior and having to leave the\noffice and go to the break room for at least 25 minutes, then your boss has just set\na premium on engaging in that behavior.\nTime-out may be boring but it beats doing work. Can you see how this might\napply to many children in a school setting? In a second phase of their experiment\n(Solnick et al., 1977), time-out was used with a student for spitting and self abuse\nduring an instructional activity. When such behaviors resulted in this student being\nremoved from the task to time-out, heightened rates of these behaviors (mean of 92\noccurrences) resulted. However, time-out was very effective in reducing these\nbehaviors when it resulted in his removal from a play period with lots of toys. The\nsame time-out procedure in this latter condition resulted in the rates of these Exposing Myths About Punishment 91\nbehaviors decreasing to zero within the first few sessions. Now that is what I call an\neffective consequence!\nMy question to you: Is time-out a punisher? Your answer: It depends. When it\nis used as a consequence for misbehaviors during a non-preferred task or activity,\nyour answer is \u201cNo, it is not a punisher.\u201d When it is used as a consequence for\nmisbehaviors during a play period, your is answer is, \u201cYes, it functions as a punisher\nwith most kids.\u201d This principle holds true for many children across many families\nand school environments.\nThe Case of: \u201cI Hope You Learned Your Lesson!\u201d\nI was a consultant to a family whose 4-year-old son had Down\u2019s\nSyndrome. He was in a preschool class, but was having difficulty in this\nprogram. The family wanted to know whether anything could be done to\nimprove his behavior at school. I went to observe him at his preschool in\nSacramento one bright sunny morning, with consent from school person-\nnel. While the school staff seemed to like him, they were not sure that he\ncould remain in this mainstream program because of his \u201cbehavioral\ndifficulties.\u201d\nWhen I arrived, he and his classmates were listening to the teacher give\na lesson on prepositions. They had a big plastic tube (the ones that children\ncan walk through) in the middle of the classroom. A child was called up to\nget in a position relative to this tube. For example, one child was told to get\n\u201cbehind the tube.\u201d The other children were supposed to be watching and\nlearning. My client of course was more interested in the girl sitting next to\nhim and her ponytails. After being repeatedly told to watch and learn, in\norder to \u201cdistract\u201d him from playing with her hair, he was called upon to\nnow stand in front of, behind and, to the side, of the tube. It was apparent\nto everyone (probably him as well) that he did not know behind, inside and\nother prepositions. He just waited for the teaching staff to move him to\nwhere he was supposed to go.\nFollowing this exercise, he sat down, and picked up where he left off:\nplaying with this girl\u2019s hair. Apparently the 20th time of bothering this girl\nwas the contingency for time-out. The teacher\u2019s aide directed him to time-\nout. She explained to him why he was placed in time-out and then was told\nto sit there until he could come out and participate in the learning situation.\nGuess where the time-out was? Next to the toy shelf. Guess where the aide\nwent? Back to the circle. Guess what my client did while he was in \u201ctime-\nout?\u201d He began playing with the toys. He must have mistaken the directive.\nHe must have thought they said, \u201cplay in time-out!\u201d instead of, \u201cstay in\ntime-out.\u201d I would venture to guess that the school staff would probably\nhave told me that time-out does not work for him. Small wonder! 92 Section II\n\u2022 What lesson was the child learning from the time-out plan?\n\u2022 Did it affect his motivation to attend to the lesson?\nWhat Are Some of the Parameters of an Effective Use of Time-out?\nAs mentioned above, time-out has to involve the removal of a reinforcing event\nor activity. Time-outs during tasks or chores the child dislikes will not function as\na punishing consequence. Further, effective use of time-out requires adherence to\nthe basic principles of punishment, to be delineated in Section III. There are several\nadditional parameters one needs to consider in using time-out: (1) location of time-\nout area, (2) duration of time-out, (3) criteria for release, (4) preventing early\nunauthorized escape from time-out, and (5) providing reinforcement upon return-\ning from time-out.\nLocation of time-out area. Location, location, location. It is not just a catchy\nphrase for real estate ads. The importance of the time-out location, if it involves\nremoval from an activity and area, makes all the difference in the world. After all, one\nwould not use a candy store as a time-out area. \u201cOK, Franco, you did not come inside\nwhen I called you. Therefore, you must spend 15 minutes in this candy store for not\ncomplying with my request in a timely manner.\u201d You can hear Franco plead, \u201cOh\nplease dad, I think I will need 25 minutes in time-out to really learn my lesson.\u201d\nWhen I teach parents how to use time-out, we first agree on which behavior, or\npossibly two behaviors, will produce time-out. We also agree to make the time-out\ninevitable when the target behavior occurs. Additionally, the advent of time-out\nmust be relatively soon after the behavior has occurred. If a parent usually has to\nargue with his or her child, the parent will be taught to physically guide the child to\ntime-out. (Note to reader- this is where a competent behavior analyst may have to make a\njudgment about whether time-out can be deployed in a given case.) If the parent seems\nunwilling or unable to get the child to time-out maybe due to size or fear of a\nretaliatory response, another consequence might be preferable.\nOnce all those formalities have been settled, the parent will take the child to an\narea void of entertaining stimuli and traffic. Areas for time-out that are nixed by me\ninclude the TV room, near the playroom, in the kitchen (high traffic area), and\nusually the bedroom. If the bedroom is to be used, the door is to be left open and\nthe parent must be willing to supervise the child while she or he sits on the bed.\nYes, that is right! The parent must be willing to sit and watch and make sure the\nchild does not engage in any pleasurable activity. When you hear parents say time-\nout does not work, ask them where the child is sent. If they say to his bedroom, ask\nthem if they close the door when the child is in time-out. If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d you\ncan guess why time-out does not work with this child!\nLength of time-out. The length of time-out is another consideration. Many\npersonnel who teach parents to use time-out have the 1-minute for every year rule.\nA child of age 3 would therefore have time-outs that last for 3 minutes, a child of age\n6 would receive 6 minutes of time-out and an elderly gentleman of 77 in a nursing\nfacility would have to endure 77 minutes! This \u201crule\u201d is one that people made up,\nwith no basis in fact. In research studies, time-outs as short as 10 seconds have been Exposing Myths About Punishment 93\neffective at reducing target behavior. However, other research studies have shown\nthe efficacy of time-outs that lasted 3 hours. Will 10-second time-out plans always\nwork? Probably not. Time-out duration should be of sufficient length to be effective,\nyet not be unnecessarily long.\nI have developed several considerations when designating the length of the time-\nout period. I base the length of time on two factors: (1) the release criteria from time-\nout, which I will detail shortly, and (2) how often the behavior occurs. If I am dealing\nwith a target behavior that occurs several times per hour, I want the time-out to be\nrelatively shorter. Why? So that the child may leave time-out and be faced with the\nopportunity to either engage in appropriate behavior, which does not produce time-\nout, or engage in the target behavior, and be sent to time-out again. The greater the\nnumber of opportunities to learn this the better. For such instances, time-outs of\nseveral minutes are sufficient. With behaviors that occur infrequently, the length of\ntime-out can be longer.\nRelease criteria. The manner in which the time-out is ended can take one of two\nforms: time contingent release or response contingent release. In the former, the\nelapse of the designated amount of time determines when the child is returned to the\nactivity from time-out. For example, if the time-out length was 5 minutes, once that\nhas elapsed, the child is returned. However, one caveat to this time contingency\nneeds to also be stipulated.\nFive minutes to me means 5 consecutive, continuous minutes in the time-out\narea, whether it be a seat or carpet square area. If a child gets up, as was the case with\nour client in the preschool class, he should be returned to time-out. Further, the time-\nout period should begin over again! How many times have you seen the following:\nChild is put in time-out. She gets up and wanders over to the play area. The adult\nsays, \u201cNow Betina have you learned your lesson?\u201d Yes, she has! Whenever she gets\ntired of time-out, she can simply get up and end that event. What is wrong with that?\nTime-out is not supposed to be a phenomenon that is terminated once the child is\nbored with it. Loss of fun activities, for a designated period of time, is how time-out\nproduces its effect.\nIt turns out that this is not just my opinion and experience with time-out. A\nresearch study with 24 children, ages 2 to 6, examined the efficacy of two different\ntypes of time-outs (Bean & Roberts, 1981). In one form of time-out, the parent\ndetermines when the child is released from time-out. In the second form of time-out,\nthe child determines when she or he is ready to end time-out.\nOne group of parents used time-out for noncompliance, with the release being\ncontingent on remaining in time-out for 2 continuous minutes and quiet for the last\n15 seconds. This group was called the parent release group. The second group, called\nthe child release group, was also sent to time-out for noncompliance. However,\naccording to the Dreikur\u2019s model (see Dreikur & Grey, 1968), when the child felt\nready to \u201cdo as you are told,\u201d the child could leave time-out. The basic comparison\nin this study was over who chooses when time-out is ended. Should it be the parent\naided with an understanding of how to provide effective consequences, or the child,\naided in the pursuit of the pleasure principle? The results should not surprise you. 94 Section II\nThe parent release group improved from an average level of compliance to parent\ncommands of 23.4% in baseline to 77.9% following the time-out usage by parents.\nThe child release group improved from 23.3% to 44.1%, not as large an improve-\nment. In fact, consider looking at these results in the following framework. When\na child determines when she or he gets out of time-out, the child is only compliant\nwith one of every two commands given (i.e., about 44% of the time). Contrast that\nwith three of four commands being followed for the parent release group.\nThe response contingent release form of time-out requires that the child not\nengage in some behavior, such as tantrums, for some period of time prior to release.\nIn the study above, the child was required to be quiet for the last 15 seconds of the\n2-minute time-out period before being released. If the child screamed right before\nthe 2 minutes were up, the time-out period was extended until the 15-second\ncriterion was met.\nAs you can imagine, especially in the beginning of implementing a response\ncontingent release time-out, time-outs will often last longer than the initial require-\nment. In some cases, a 2-minute time-out can last 25 minutes the first time. However,\nfor the overwhelming majority of clients from my clinical practice with whom I have\nused this form of time-out, within 1-2 days of using time-out, the length approxi-\nmates the initial value. The children learn it is not in their best interest to tantrum\nor scream while in time-out, for it only prolongs it. The children learn to accept the\nconsequence and move on once it is done.\nWhat is the purpose behind the response contingent release? I have no data to\nsupport my argument that a response contingent release is more effective than a\nsimple time-elapse release. But I prefer the response contingent release form of time-\nout, because it also teaches compliance while in time-out. If time-out truly has\nremoved a reinforcing activity, then the longer the removal from the activity is\nincurred, the more motivated the child is to leave time-out. When parents remark\nthat their child might stay in time-out a long time screaming, I tell them the\nfollowing. Time is on your side (see, even the Rolling Stones understood this\nmaxim). Eventually the child will stop and learn that screaming gets him or her\nnowhere.\nBut why does it take some children longer to figure this out? If a child wants to\nleave time-out, why would he or she engage in screaming and tantrum behavior? It\nis not in the child\u2019s best interest to do so. Children scream because this is the way\nthey usually terminate activities and things they do not want. If someone turns off\ntheir TV program, they tantrum and scream. If they are told they cannot have ice\ncream, they scream until their parent \u201cgives in.\u201d When they are in situations not to\ntheir liking, their supercomputer brain is busy at work. Their databases are firing\naway, coming up with plausible scenarios of how to deal with their dilemma. After\nall this electro-chemical activity, the result pops up. Yep, after this extensive search\nof all similar circumstances and outcomes, screaming is your best bet here. Do that,\nit is likely to work. Scream, and scream loud, especially if other behavioral efforts\nhave failed to impress mom or dad. Exposing Myths About Punishment 95\nI do not want to add screaming as an adaptive way to get out of time-out. And\nunfortunately, if they scream the entire time they are in time-out, what do you think\nthey learn? Scream for 2 minutes and you get released. They may be unaware that\nyou planned to release them regardless of what they were doing. They may\nsuperstitiously learn that screaming terminates time-out, like it does so many other\nunpleasant events.\nThe response contingent form of release from time-out teaches children that\nscreaming is not an adaptive response to this situation. Even though I know this is\ndifficult for some parents to stick to, I feel we need to draw a line in the sand. This\ncan often be your first test to stick to consequences for tantrum behavior. Consider\nit a test you must pass.\nPreventing unauthorized escape from time-out. When a child attempts to get out\nof time-out before the release criteria has been met, the efficacy of time-out is\ncompromised as demonstrated in previous research. Does the way a parent deals with\nattempted escapes from time-out affect the capability of that consequence to act as\na punisher? You bet! A study compared several parental reactions to escape attempts\nfrom time-out on the frequency of escape attempts (Roberts & Powers, 1990). In\nother words, does the way a parent react to the child leaving time-out affect such\nescape behaviors during time-out?\nOne group of parents was taught to spank their child when their child attempted\nto get out of the chair time-out (called spank group). In another group, the parents\nwere taught to hold (restrain) their child in the chair (called hold group). In a third\ngroup, parents were taught to place their child in an empty room, with a 4 foot high\nplywood board blocking the exit, physically preventing them from leaving (called\nbarrier group). These three groups required the child to remain a certain amount of\ntime in time-out and also the child\u2019s release from time-out was response contingent.\nWhich of the three groups had the least number of escape attempts from time-\nout? The percentage of children exhibiting excessive escape attempts in each group\nwas the following: Spank group 33%, hold group 56%, and barrier group 17%. The\nbarrier condition resulted in the fewest number of children attempting to continu-\nally get out of time-out. In contrast, the hold group was an ineffective and exhausting\nprocedure for dealing with escape attempts. Preventing escape is a logistical concern\nfor the implementation of time-out by parents. Again, some parents may need the\naide of a competent behavior analyst to help them with this aspect.\nReinforcement following return from time-out. I also teach parents that when the\nchild returns from time-out, catch her or him being good. It is important to have this\ncontrast: hit sister, go to time-out. Play nicely, get a hug from mom. Do not continue\nto ignore appropriate behavior once the child is back from time-out. If there is this\ncontrast between what you do when your child is in time-out and what you do when\nyour child is not, you will get a nice effect from time-out.\nI remember working at one of the Head Start classes where we were using time-\nout on children who would aggress against their peers. One of the 4-year-old boys,\nwho was escorted by me to time-out, was not a happy Head Start camper. He sat\ndefiantly in time-out, and upon completing his time requirement, returned to the 96 Section II\nsame activity that started his trouble before. I can remember him looking at me as\nif, well you can guess. His glistening stare told the whole story. He was not used to\nbeing punished for such behavior (and unfortunately was a frequent aggressor). As\na side note, I believe the purpose of that stare was: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me again.\u201d\nI was working with the teacher responsible for this boy and the other children\nin his group. I think most people would have been hesitant to become involved with\nhim again, and would have stayed clear of him. I knew he was going to present a\nproblem to the teachers, in terms of enacting time-out. If he made me apprehensive,\nI could only imagine what the teachers felt when he stared them down. Luckily a\nvoice beckoned to me: \u201cCatch him being good.\u201d I watched him play with the other\nchildren and then a perfect opportunity was laid in front of me. He had just shared\nwith one of the other children a toy matchbox car. I scurried over to him and said,\n\u201cWow, both of you are really playing nice together. I like the way you are sharing\nthese cars (looking straight at him).\u201d You could see the ice melt and a beaming smile\ntook its place. For the remainder of my observation in that class, I cannot recount\nhim aggressing further. I never forgot the lesson that 4-year-old taught me about the\nimportance of what adults do when a child returns from time-out. By the way, his\nmother stopped me a few days subsequent to his visit to time-out (by me) and\nthanked me. She said, \u201cYou know he needs to be straightened out. He can be too\ncontrolling and mean.\u201d I thought, \u201cYes ma\u2019am, I know where you are coming from.\nI saw it in his eyes.\u201d\nAn effective punisher very often makes other behaviors more probable. Do not\nmiss this opportunity to reinforce acceptable behaviors subsequent to the child\nbeing placed in time-out no matter how odd it may feel.\nWhat Are the Implications of a Response-contingent Release of\nTime-out?\nI also believe there is another benefit of this form of time-out. In the\noverwhelming majority of cases, the child learns to eventually accept time-out\nwithout much resistance. If a child learns to accept time-out without generating\nadditional outbursts, it will be easier for others to use time-out, or some other similar\npunisher, with your child. Why is this important? Children who get into serious\ntrouble at school often get to that level not as a result of the initial incident. It was\nthe child\u2019s response to a levied consequence that resulted in the parent being called\nto the principal\u2019s office to come pick up their child.\nHarry, a fictitious student, receives a math assignment from his ninth grade\nteacher. He is in a funny mood, so he tries to pick the paper up with his mouth. The\nother kids are laughing hysterically. Harry\u2019s teacher tells him that his display of\nlunacy cost him five minutes of recess time. At the mention of loss of recess time,\nHarry calls her a word that rhymes with witch. (Note to reader: his cerebral data bank\ntold him that will improve his chances to get the five minutes restored.) Oops, Houston we\nhave a problem. Maybe such a response works at home with mom, but not in school!\nOf course that response winds him in the principal\u2019s office, with a threat of a sexual Exposing Myths About Punishment 97\nharassment charge possibly being filed. His mother is called for this serious\nbehavioral incident.\nHis mother is not meeting with the principal of the school because Harry acted\nsilly. If he had accepted his consequences, that would have ended it. She is pleading\nfor her child\u2019s educational life, under threat of expulsion, because of his response to\nthe consequence. More often than not, it is best to accept those initial consequences\nrather than engage in more debilitating behaviors. The development of this\nunderstanding in children, I believe, requires additional effort on our part. An\nadditional contingency is often needed when these debilitating behaviors occur\nduring the time-out period, hence my strong preference for response contingent\nreleases.\nI believe parents need to teach their children early in life that consequences are\ninevitable when certain behaviors occur. By teach, I do not mean preach one thing\nand practice the opposite. The child will learn this by your following through on\nconsequences to behavior. The child will learn that escalation of her or his behavior\nwill not minimize the consequence in the least. Children need a parent who does\nmore than provide a lecture to them about accepting consequences. They need\nsomeone who enforces the policy. That is how they really learn this lesson.\nWhy Does Time-out Not Work for Many Parents?\nIf you are getting the message that many people who claim time-out does not\nwork are the same people who misuse it, you are an astute reader of my sarcasm. To\nreiterate, time-out has worked great in research studies where all these concerns have\nbeen addressed. It has not worked as great when people who are not apprised of these\nparameters have deployed it for their child\u2019s misbehavior. If a person\u2019s definition of\ntime-out is moving a child to a corner, you should tell them to read and re-read this\nsection many times. Time-out can be successful, but it takes some basic understand-\ning of the reasons behind its effectiveness and issues related to its implementation.\nTo learn more about how to use time-out effectively, please consult the relevant\nchapter in my book, Helping Parents Help Their Kids: A Clinical Guide to Six Child\nProblem Behavior (Cipani, 1999).\nWhat Can Be Used for Older Children, in Place of Time-out?\nWith teenagers, their access to privileges can supplant time-out. For the\noccurrence of a specific target behavior, privileges are lost that day or evening. If the\ntarget behavior does not occur, or occurs relatively infrequently, the child or\nadolescent earns privileges. Further, this type of consequence can be used in a\nmanner that gradually teaches the child self-control with respect to a given behavior.\nThis is accomplished by tying a certain criterion level of behavior to accessing\nprivileges. Going above the criterion for that day results in loss of evening privileges;\nstaying at or below that level results in privileges available that day/evening.\nLet us say we have an adolescent that does not comply with his parent\u2019s simple\ndirectives. His mother may ask him to throw his empty soda cans in the trash, or pick\nhis socks up off the floor, and other similar demands. His rate of compliance is low, 98 Section II\nas reported by his mother. She claims he rarely follows through with her requests.\nOnly if she threatens him with telling his father of his insolence when his father gets\nhome does he sometimes shape up. (Yes the old, \u201cwait till your father gets home,\u201d\nploy.) But even that is not full proof. Given that his compliance is low, it also means\nthat his noncompliance is high. Let us say we measure the rate of noncompliance\neach day for a 1-week period. The following data is collected.\nDay Number of non-compliant incidents\nMonday 7\nTuesday 6\nWednesday 8\nThursday 11\nFriday 10\nIf you review these results, you see that this child is noncompliant to parental\nrequests. He had a low of 6 non-compliant incidents on Wednesday and a high of\n11 on Thursday. We select the criterion that no more than 7 occurrences of\nnoncompliance in a given day earns him access to privileges. On days when he\nexceeds this level of noncompliance, he will lose out on privileges. The data on\nnoncompliance for the next week reveals that he clearly knows where the line is.\nDay Number of non-compliant incidents\nMonday 5\nTuesday 4\nWednesday 6\nThursday 5\nFriday 6\nAs he achieved access to the privilege readily for 5 straight days, the criterion is\nmoved down a few incidents to five or less. The result for the third week is given\nbelow.\nDay Number of non-compliant incidents\nMonday 3\nTuesday 4\nWednesday 6 (lost privileges that evening)\nThursday 2\nFriday 4\nHe reaches the criterion for success on 4 of the 5 days. But it is important to note\nwhat the effect of the loss of privileges on Wednesday was on the next day\u2019s\nperformance. He had his best day. I\u2019ll bet he said to himself the morning after the\nloss of privileges, \u201cBoy I do not want to lose TV and going out with my friends again\ntonight.\u201d Loss of privileges effects behavior change in this adolescent. Exposing Myths About Punishment 99\nI have used loss of privileges for many of the cases that we have worked on across\na 2-decade period. Sometimes it is loss of TV time, sometimes it is loss of video rentals\non the weekends, or playing with friends after homework is done, and in a few cases,\nloss of the family car for the weekend (obviously these were kids of driving age).\nSometimes, what you use as a contingent event takes a lot of ingenuity and\nthought. It requires that you always watch what activities or items interest your child.\nWhen you see children doing some activity everyday, of their own accord, think\ncontingent privilege. Let me give you a case in point. One day I was paid to do an\nin-service for a local elementary school in Stockton in the early 1980s. Several\nteachers were having problems managing some of their students, and the principal\nhad been referred to me as \u201cthe behavior modifier.\u201d\nI arrived early for my workshop after the school day was over. The principal was\ntied up with someone on the phone so I was told to wait in the office. The bell rang,\nsignaling the end of the school day. To my surprise, a hoard of kids headed for the\nprincipal\u2019s office, of their own choice. They went right to a pencil machine in the\ncorner and began inserting nickels into the machine. Some kids must have been\nburning the midnight oil studying because they apparently needed six, seven or even\neight pencils. The line eventually disappeared, but not before the pencil machine\nhad seen a whirlwind of activity. \u201cStrange,\u201d I thought to myself.\nI was invited into the office, and after some pleasantries I asked in a puzzled\nmanner, \u201cWhat is it with the kids buying pencils?\u201d The principal proudly boasted,\n\u201cThat pencil machine is really going to help the PTA. You see every fourth or fifth\npencil dispensed, on average, has a Pac-Man insignia on the pencil. The kids just keep\nputting nickels in.\u201d My first thought was \u201cThe next time I get invited to this school,\nthe school staff are probably going to want me to give a talk entitled, \u201cThe treatment\nof kids with a pencil-buying addiction: The next crisis in children\u2019s mental health.\u201d\nAll kidding aside, my immediate thought was the following. The power this machine\nhad could certainly be used more effectively. How? A contingent relationship could\nbe established after collecting some baseline data. For example, anyone with a\nbehavioral incident would lose 2 to 4 consecutive days of buying privileges in the\noffice or school store. The more adroit a parent or teacher becomes at spotting\nunique but powerful consequences, and learns to use them, the more the child will\nexert self-control over problem behaviors. Watch the kids, their behavior will lead\nthe way. 100 Section II Six Basic Principles of Punishment 101\nSection III:\nSix Basic Principles of Punishment\nIt should be evident that outcome-oriented punishment adheres to some basic\nprinciples that distinguish it from consequences that are ineffective. The following\nprinciples of effective punishment are drawn from a list of 14 principles that were\nenumerated by two psychologists, Drs. Azrin and Holz (1966). Their presentation\nof these 14 principles was based on numerous research studies in animal laboratories\nand some experimental research with humans at the time. Since that time, research\nstudies testing the efficacy of various behavioral contingencies have supported these\nprinciples.\nI have selected five principles of effective punishment, from their list. I have also\nadded one: Prove it works with children. These six principles are most relevant for\nconsideration when using procedures that may function as punishment to change\nchild behavior.\n\u2022 Principle I: There Must Exist a Behavioral Contingency\n\u2022 Principle II: Be Consistent\n\u2022 Principle III: The \u201cEven Swap\u201d Rule\n\u2022 Principle IV: Remove Competing Consequences\n\u2022 Principle V: Be Specific\n\u2022 Principle VI: Prove It Works\nPrinciple I: There Must Exist a Behavioral Contingency\nWhat is a behavioral contingency? At the heart of outcome-oriented punish-\nment is the behavioral contingency. Put simply, a behavioral contingency is a reliable\ntemporal relationship between a specific behavior and a consequence. You may have\nheard this referred to as an, \u201cIf ___, then ___,\u201d statement. For example, if you eat your\npeas, then you can have dessert. Conversely, if you don\u2019t eat your peas, then you\ndon\u2019t get your dessert. Similarly, if you brush your teeth, then you can go outside.\nConversely, if you do not brush your teeth, then you cannot go outside. Both of\nthese are examples of behavioral contingencies, a temporal relationship between a\nbehavior and some event that follows it reliably (i.e., a consequence).\nIn order for a punishment effect to occur, a reliable link between the specific\nbehavior and the intended consequence has to exist. Further, this reliable relation-\nship produces a lowered level of the behavior (i.e., punishment). If a parent removes\nthe child\u2019s dessert whenever she fails to eat her peas in a given period of time, its effect\non behavior determines whether punishment has occurred. Let me use a hypotheti-\ncal example to illustrate a behavioral contingency involving punishment. 102 Section III\nWhat Happens On the Planet Freudania?\nLet\u2019s say we have an alien family who has just beamed down from the\nfictitious planet Freudania. They have taken custody of an Earth child they\nfound in the woods. (Note to reader: I need you to go with me on this.) In\nattempting to uncover child-rearing approaches on earth, they initially\nformulate the policy of letting the child guide their practice. They say to\neach other, \u201cLet\u2019s see what she does and then we can determine how Earth\nparents raise their children.\u201d They set this practice in motion, allowing her\nto engage in whatever behavior she desires. For example, at mealtime, they\nallow this child to eat food in whatever order she desires. To their\namazement she eats the dessert first and always leaves the vegetables. Of\ncourse, they have heard this is not wise, nutritionally. They are surprised to\nsee the lack of self-responsibility on the part of this child. This is quite in\ncontrast to Freudania children, who after going through the Oedipal-\nErectus stage of development, are quite responsible and need no direction\nfrom parents in their daily life. In fact, on Freudania, parents can only get\nin the way of their child\u2019s development, by interfering with their natural\ngrowth toward good. It is therefore best to let the child be himself or herself.\nAlas such is not the case with these Earth children. After 7 weeks of this\nfailed policy, they conclude that they must try something else. After\nbecoming attentive listeners to a variety of afternoon talk shows, they\nsurmise that earth children are responsive to logic and reasoning. If they are\ntold why something is good for them, they will \u201csee the light,\u201d and will start\neating their vegetables. They remark to each other, \u201cBoy that sure is easy.\nWhy did we not see that in the beginning. Before each mealtime, we will\nreason with this Earth child, providing her with a nice discussion on the\nlong-term value of eating vegetables.\u201d They proceed in earnest. During their\ndiscussions with this child, they go all out to show her the benefits of eating\nvegetables. They cite data, show her charts, and describe what she will look\nlike if she eats vegetables. They even provide her with testimony from\nactresses who ate their vegetables when they were her age and now have\nmillion-dollar modeling and acting contracts. After another 7 weeks, to\ntheir surprise, this does not generate much in the way of their adopted\ndaughter eating vegetables. However, it does seem to encourage a lot of\narguing, excuses, and crying fits from her. Maybe they failed to compre-\nhend what the people on the talk shows said this strategy was good for.\nPerhaps this is how Earth trains their young early in life for a legal career!\nOne day they pick up a book, which seems to promote an alternate method\nto get their daughter to finally start eating her vegetables. This book teaches\nthem to designate the relationship between getting dessert and eating\nvegetables to be one of a contingency. First vegetables, then dessert. As a Six Basic Principles of Punishment 103\nresult of this practice over the next 7 weeks the vegetables are no longer left\non the plate. They are elated at their daughter\u2019s progress. Apparently on\nEarth, one must get the behavior to occur, before giving out the preferred\nevent. Again, such is not a behavioral principle on Freudania.\nUnlike Freudania, on the third rock from the sun, the principle of a behavioral\ncontingency forms the basis for scientific demonstrations of the efficacy of conse-\nquences. The behavioral contingency is to the understanding of human behavior as\nDNA is to the field of genetics. Many studies in the last 7 decades have used the\nbehavioral contingency as the basis for studying what causes behavior to change. The\nstrength of this field, called behavior analysis, was, and is, its reliance on an\naccumulation of scientific evidence prior to building hypotheses and theories about\neffective treatments. It is important to note that a theory of punishment developed\nout of research data demonstrating the effectiveness of certain behavioral contingen-\ncies to reduce the rate of behavior. This runs contrary to the usual manner in which\ntraditional psychological theories proceed. In most other theories of human\nbehavior, scholars come up with elaborate hypotheses and theories that attempt to\nexplain real life behavioral phenomenon before an empirical basis is established.\nI remember as an undergraduate in the early 1970s, that some psychology\nprofessors were less than impressed with the applications of behavioral principles of\nreinforcement and punishment to human behavior. A comment from a fictitious\nProfessor Freud-Jung may have been along the following line: \u201cThat behavior mod\nstuff only works for animals. You would not want to use it for real life problems with\nchildren.\u201d\nWhen I inquired why this behavior mod stuff could not work with human\nsubjects, I would got a frown, followed by a scowl. In the professor\u2019s line of reasoning,\nchanging human behavior should be made more complex. How simple minded of\nme to even raise such a question! Dr. Freud-Jung might have responded to my\nquestion in the following manner, \u201cThis type of model is too simple. You mean all\none has to do to help parents help their kids is to determine what procedures increase\nbehavior and what procedures decrease behavior? That is not realistic. Something\nreally deep is at the root of child problems.\u201d Yes, I noted, something was getting really\ndeep!\nAs the saying goes, simple is better. The simplicity of this focus (i.e., how to\nincrease and decrease behavior) is all one often needs to help parents. For example,\nMrs. Riccardo (fictitious character) tells the school psychologist that her son does not\nstudy like he should. What is the presenting problem in its basic form? What is this\nmother wanting help with? Her child does not study enough, and she would like him\nto study more. This is a problem requiring the use of factors that increase that\nbehavior. Anything that does not contribute to that analysis is extra baggage, no\nmatter how impressed the proponent of the \u201cdeep analysis\u201d believes his or her\ncolleagues would be. 104 Section III\nWhat Happens When People Use Consequences Haphazardly?\nI once heard someone say, \u201cYeah, I use that behavior mod stuff. When my kid\nmisbehaves, I give him a time-out.\u201d While this may sound like a behavioral\ncontingency, it is a deceptive impostor. What constitutes misbehavior? If a specific\nbehavior is not delineated, then the parent\u2019s judgment about the child\u2019s misbehavior\nis required. Do you think that there will be consistency over a 2- week period in\napplying time-out to a uniform behavior? Not likely. Early researchers did not\nreinforce the rat when it looked like it was engaged in purposeful actions. That might\nhave constituted everything from bar pressing to voiding in the cage. As you can\nimagine, the rat would never have \u201cfigured out\u201d what single behavior produced food\nand might have been forced to engage in some pretty wacky routines. Similarly, a\nbehavioral contingency plan that requires an adult to detect accurately when the\nchild is misbehaving is not something you want to bet on.\nThis lack of stipulating a behavioral contingency is what I term a haphazard use\nof consequences. It is quite often the case in everyday efforts to change child\nbehavior. Many parents, when resorting to behavior mod, attempt to modify many\nundesirable behaviors of their child all in one shot. I call this the, \u201clet\u2019s fix everything,\nbecause I only want to do this once,\u201d approach to raising kids. Subsequently, instead\nof focusing on one target behavior, the parent wants to use a designated consequence\nfor everything under the rubric of, \u201cIf it pisses me off, it is misbehavior, and I will\nsend him to his room.\u201d\nLet\u2019s take the hypothetical case of Mr. and Mrs. Ringer. They have decided to\nuse time-out to deal with their almost 4-year-old, defiant daughter, Vanessa. They\nreport they will put her in the corner when she needs it. Obviously they did not think\nthrough what specific behavior will be targeted. They believe that they will be best\nserved by going with their gut instinct at the time. Whenever they think Vanessa has\nbehaved badly, she will get a time-out.\nWhat does a gut instinct approach to consequences look like? The first time Mr.\nRinger gave his daughter a time-out, it was immediately following a verbal defiance\nof his request to pick up her toys. The next time Vanessa was sent to time-out when\nshe threw a toy in the house. Her father remarked, \u201cShe should have known better,\nand did this to spite me, so I\u2019ll teach her!\u201d Subsequently, two noncompliant acts\noccurred, to two requests to get a broom, and such did not generate a time-out. When\nquestioned about the apparent discrepancy, Mr. Ringer considered these\nnoncompliant acts mild in comparison to the verbal defiance she displayed earlier.\nLater that day, Vanessa refused to go take her nap. She argued back and forth with\nMrs. Ringer until Vanessa shouted, \u201cno, you poopy.\u201d This was followed by a time-\nout.\nHow consistent are the Ringers? My answer is, \u201cHow can one be consistent with\nsomething so encompassing as any misbehavior?\u201d As you can see, making a decision\nabout whether a set of behaviors constitutes something as broad as misbehavior is\nfraught with problems. Deploying time-out for a child\u2019s misbehavior may sound\ngood in theory, but it stinks in practice. Six Basic Principles of Punishment 105\nWhat should the Ringers have done? The Ringers might have sat down and\ndetermined which misbehavior they wanted to concentrate on first. Let us say that\nthey both decide to use time-out only when Vanessa calls them names of a\nderogatory nature (e.g., \u201cpoopy,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re stupid,\u201d \u201cyou brat,\u201d and of course the\ndouble whammy, \u201cYou are a stupid poopy.\u201d). Other behaviors will not result in time-\nout (yet). Only derogatory names. Each time she says something that is in that class\nof behaviors, she will be placed in time-out. Now a specific behavior produces a\nspecific consequence (i.e., a behavioral contingency exists). If Vanessa makes a\nderogatory comment, she will go to time-out for 4 minutes. The research study\ndescribed below illustrates the principle of specifying a behavioral contingency.\nSubjective vs. Objective Targets Makes All the Difference in the\nWorld!\nCan adults use subjective judgments about a phenomenon as the basis for\ndelivering a punishing consequence? I cannot say always, but it is a sure bet that more\noften than not, one will not achieve the desired level of behavior change. A study\nthat made a comparison between consequences for specific target behaviors versus\nconsequences based on subjective judgment sheds scientific evidence on this issue\n(White & Bailey, 1990).\nLet\u2019s say you are a physical education (PE) teacher in an elementary school and\nare faced regularly with children in two of your gym classes who engage in the\nfollowing three classes of disruptive behaviors. First, they do not comply with your\nrequests to engage in some activity or exercise. Second, the students hit other\nchildren while you are trying to explain some sport or exercise to them. Third, they\nthrow stuff at each other when you are not looking. We have all been in PE classes\nas children and probably remember some classes that were in a state of havoc daily.\nThe PE teacher\u2019s job in managing children is complicated by the inherent fact that\nPE class often takes place in an outside environment.\nSuch was the case in a Tallahassee elementary school in the late 1980s.\nBehavioral researchers Alicia White and Dr. Jon Bailey consulted with a PE teacher\nwho designated two classes that he needed help with. They decided to conduct a\nstudy, pitting the effectiveness of a behavioral contingency against an approach that\nprovides consequences based on an overall appraisal of the student\u2019s behavior. The\nlatter approach can be likened to the \u201cI will go with my gut instinct,\u201d approach.\nIn the worst of the two classes, the rates of these reported problem behaviors\nwere collected in a baseline condition (i.e., conditions that were typically in effect).\nThese researchers merely counted the occurrence of the three classes of problem\nbehaviors, but did not provide any additional help or advice. The rate of occurrence\nof these behaviors in 10-minute observations taken over a several day period was\nbetween 130 and 343 (a mean of 219 occurrences). No wonder the teacher was asking\nfor help. Most people would be begging to quit!\nFollowing the collection of this data the teacher decided to try something on his\nown. He attempted to change the children\u2019s behavior by using a rating system for 106 Section III\neach child during the class period. Each child was rated by the teacher as super, good,\nfair, or poor, in regards to four categories: respecting adults and peers, listening to\nand following directions, keeping hands and/or feet to self, and reporting incidents\nto teacher. In other words, the teacher was to judge each child as to his or her level\nof misbehavior for that gym period, and give each child a super, good, fair or poor\nrating. The primary consequence of a child obtaining a poor rating was loss of a free\nplay period later in the week and/or a parent conference or visit to the principal.\nTo the untrained eye this may look like a behavioral contingency. If you are bad\n(i.e., rating of poor) for the gym period, you will lose your free play (supposed\npunishing consequence). Right? Wrong. There is no specific behavior that produces\nthe loss of free play. Rather, it is comprised of an ever-changing constellation of\nbehaviors.\nWhat was the effect of this intervention on the rate of the disruptive behaviors?\nIn the worst class, the mean rate of disruptive behaviors for the ten-minute period\nof observation was now down to 98.5. While this is better than before, this still\nrepresents a class that has significant problems. It is obvious there is still plenty of\nroom for improvement. Could a behavioral contingency improve on that? It is time\nto put up or keep quiet, right?\nThe behavioral contingency developed by the researchers to address the still\nhigh rates of disruptive behaviors in the two classes was called \u201csit and watch\u201d. The\nfollowing behaviors were to produce the sit and watch consequence: (1) failure to\ncomply with teacher request by initiating movement within 5 seconds of instruction,\n(2) hitting others, and (3) throwing things at others. Contingent on the occurrence\nof any of the above behaviors the child was instructed to take a timer and go to an\narea away from the activity and sit and watch for 3 minutes. Additional consequences\nwere added to the sit and watch procedure for the first class as an additional means\nof decreasing such behaviors. If the child went to sit and watch once during the\nperiod, she or he would lose daily computer time. If the child went to sit and watch\nmore than once during the same period she or he also lost a free play period once\nevery two weeks. If the child engaged in disruptive behavior during sit and watch,\nshe or he lost free play that day. Finally if someone talked to a child in sit and watch,\nthat child also got to experience it.\nHow did this specific behavioral contingency affect the rate of disruptive\nbehavior relative to the rating system? The mean rate of disruptive behaviors for the\nfirst class was 4.6 over the period of the study. What a difference a behavioral\ncontingency can make! Now one has a class that is manageable. The difference\nbetween a behavior producing a consequence versus using a judgment about the\nchild\u2019s behavior as the basis for consequences can make all the difference in the\nworld.\nPrinciple II: Be Consistent\nWho would deny that parents should be consistent in disciplining their child?\nEveryone believes in consistency. This is a principle that people verbally profess Six Basic Principles of Punishment 107\nupon cue, but such verbal commitment does not often translate into practice. I\nbelieve many people who say they are consistent really believe they are. However,\nthey think of consistency as a phenomenon above 50%. Here\u2019s what I mean by\nconsistency.\nWhen I was an undergraduate majoring in psychology, one of my professors\nsaid the following in a lecture stressing consistency. \u201cWhen the subject performs the\ntarget behavior, the consequence must be inevitable. If this, then this implies the\nconcept of inevitability.\u201d The concept of inevitability certainly does not say, if this\nthen maybe this. The early animal research this professor cited, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of punishment certainly produced inevitable consequences for a target\nbehavior (Azrin, 1960; Azrin, Holz, & Hake, 1963).\nWhen I am called in to consult on a case where a behavioral plan has already\nbeen tried and has failed, I remember those words. I ask myself, \u201cFrom everything\nyou have seen is the contingency inevitable?\u201d Many times the answer is, \u201cthe\ncontingency is unreliable, at best.\u201d\nThis is an example of an inevitable contingency: If you hit your sister, you will\ngo to time-out. Contrast that statement with the following example: If you hit your\nsister you might go to time-out, unless you apologize, begin crying, or claim you have\na stomach pain. Also, if it is Thursday, that is the time-out holiday, where time-out\ntakes a holiday. While this sounds funny, this inconsistency happens in homes\nacross America all the time (not the Thursday part). I\u2019ve been there.\nEvery Single Time is Better, Just Ask Rusty Clark!\nAt the heart of this zeal for consistency is an understanding of what happens\nwhen people are less than consistent. The behavioral contingency loses its ability to\nproduce a change in the target behavior. This is exemplified in a 1973 study\nconducted at the University of Kansas by Dr. Hewitt \u201cRusty\u201d Clark and colleagues\n(Clark, Rowbury, Baer, & Baer, 1973). An 8-year-old child with mental retardation\nwas attending a special school program. This child engaged in a variety of disruptive\nand aggressive behaviors involving inappropriate physical contact with the other\nchildren in the class. The child would bear hug other children, choke them, hit and\nkick them, and hit objects. Obviously she had not read the book, How to make friends\nand influence people.\nWhen the teacher just ignored the behavior (staff intervened when it looked like\nshe might hurt another child), high rates of disruptive and aggressive behaviors\nresulted. For 3 days, using this plan, her rate of these behaviors exceeded 20, with a\nhigh of 74 occurrences on one day! Simply attending to her for behavior other than\ninappropriate contact did not produce the desired result in this case. (Note to reader:\nIgnoring behavior does not always work as some experts may have led you to believe.) Dr.\nClark and his colleagues then taught the teacher how to use time-out whenever these\naggressive behaviors toward other children or objects occurred.\nThese researchers were interested in ascertaining what happens when time-out\nis inevitable versus when it is less consistent. Therefore, in one condition, time-out\noccurred every single time. Let\u2019s term that the \u201cinevitable condition\u201d. In another 108 Section III\ncondition, these behaviors did not produce a time-out every single time. Rather,\ntime-out occurred once every eight times on the average, this is called a \u201cvariable ratio\neight (VR 8)\u201d schedule. Sometimes time-out may have occurred on the third\noccurrence of the aggressive behavior, other times the child may have engaged in\naggressive behavior 12 times before the teacher gave her a time-out.\nWhat were the results? The average rate of aggressive behaviors for the inevitable\ncondition was three per day, down from 20 in the previous \u201cignore it and it will go\naway\u201d condition. Equally impressive was that in 6 of the 8 days in this inevitable\nconsequence condition, the rate of occurrence of target behaviors was either 0 or 1.\nIn contrast, the average rate of aggressive behaviors for the VR 8 condition was 14\nper day. While an intermittent use of time-out was apparently better than no time-\nout at all, it did not really bring the behavior down to a manageable level. What did\nwork with this girl is the inevitable consequence of aggression being time-out. I have\nfound similar results to Dr. Clark\u2019s research in a study we conducted with a child\ntesting two punishing stimuli (Cipani, Brendlinger, McDowell, & Usher, 1991).\nThe more likely the target behavior produces the intended consequence, the\nmore likely a punishment effect will be achieved. On the other hand, failure to follow\nthrough, for whatever reason, lessens the chance of success. But sometimes,\nconsistency requires a lot of effort on the part of the parent. The example below\nillustrates the amount of effort needed in extreme cases.\nThe Case of the Future \u201cWWE\u201d Star:\nThe Price of Persistence\nThere is certainly much controversy over the imitation of wrestling\nmoves, as observed on TV, by young children. Some children apparently\ndiscriminate between what is seen on TV and what is allowed on the\nplayground, but others do not. If a child has a developmental delay, this\ndistinction between TV and real life may be even more clouded.\nSuch was the case with Barry. He lived with his mother and her\ncommon law spouse, Barry\u2019s stepfather. Cartoons did not interest him. But\nwhen he would hear on TV, \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to rumble,\u201d he was fixated on\nthe TV. Barry became quite adept at imitating these moves. At first, his\ntarget was his stepfather and he readily responded, by play wrestling with\nhis son. However, it became problematic when it occurred with mom, and\nthen his sister. She would try to explain to him how it was inappropriate,\nand that he cannot always do what he wants. She always stated that she\nloved him, but she would draw the line when he put her in a full nelson.\nShe tried time-out but reported it did not work (use of unknown proportion\nto occurrence of aggression). She would occasionally spank him, as a last\nresort. As my behavioral specialist found out later, she probably did not Six Basic Principles of Punishment 109\nresort to time-outs very often because of their immediate effect: full scale\naggression toward her from Barry.\nOur approach was two-fold. We felt that Barry and his stepfather\nshould bond in some fashion and they both seemed to enjoy this play\nwrestling. The problem was that it extended to other inappropriate times,\nplaces, and people. Therefore, we decided to allow it to occur to very limited\nconditions. The stepfather would play wrestle with him in the living room\nwhen he signaled to Barry the advent of the wrestling match. Lastly, a carpet\nrug used especially for wrestling with his stepfather was advocated, to really\nmake the distinction with Barry.\nBut Barry was also aggressive when it was to his advantage to be so. For\nexample, his mother might have asked him to pick up something. He may\nnot have wanted to be interrupted in whatever he was doing. If she pressed\nthe issue, she then experienced the \u201cBarry retaliatory\u201d response. We felt that\naggression under situations where it was not part of the father-son bonding\nactivity required a time-out. My behavioral specialist trained Barry\u2019s mom\nto deliver the time-out. She escorted him to time-out in a gentle but firm\nmanner, required him to stay there for a continuous period of time, and\nprovided close supervision while he remained in time-out. Getting up from\ntime-out resulted in Barry being put back in time-out by his mother, with\nan additional amount of time required. Once he quieted down for 30\nseconds he was released from time-out.\nBarry did not take this new way of handling him in stride. He escalated\nhis assaultive behavior on his mother, as well as physically assaulting\nproperty, while being taken to time-out. He continued his rampage while\nin time-out. This escalation necessitated our teaching Barry\u2019s mother how\nto restrain him when he escalated to this level. We have a saying, \u201cWhen\nthe going gets tough, are you?\u201d\nMany parents who profess that time-out does not work with their\nyoung child often give up during these circumstances. Barry\u2019s mom was not\none of them. She was relentless in her pursuit to enforce the time-out. It was\nessential that she succeed now when he was only 4 years old. What would\nhappen in a few years when he is bigger and stronger?\nTime-out and other additional reinforcement procedures worked well,\nin drastically reducing aggressive behavior. His rate of tantrums was less\nfrequent and less severe. Additionally, due to a compliance plan, he was\nnow following requests to pick up things by his mother. Eight months after\nour initial involvement, Barry had learned that there was a time and a place\nfor wrestling. Further, he was not using his tactical knowledge of aggressive\nmoves as an instrument of resistance to parental requests. Barry\u2019s mother\nreported that he still required time-outs for occasional aggressive behavior.\nHowever, she was now able to effect the time-out without generating\naggressive behavior on Barry\u2019s part. He did his time-out without much fuss 110 Section III\nand then proceeded with the rest of his day. This result is crucial, since Barry\nwas getting physically more capable with age. It was necessary for him to\naccept consequences for his behavior, while he was still young. Consistency\nwas essential in this case, and it paid off in big dividends.\n\u2022 Why did the time-out procedure work?\n\u2022 Are all parents equally capable of effecting time out? If not, should\nanother procedure be considered?\nIs the Principle of Consistency Necessary?\nYes, for the reasons illustrated above. I believe that many of the conclusions\nabout punishment are based on applications that have little integrity, as far as\nconsistency goes. For example, Dr. Murray Strauss (1994) concluded in a book that\nspanking does not work. What research evidence did he use to support his\ncontention? He conducted a study on spanking by asking 270 college students to first\nidentify the year they experienced the most corporal punishment. In other words\nthey were to recollect this information from memory. The mean age, reported by\nthese interviewees, at which the greatest amount of spankings occurred was when\nthey were 8 years old. The average number of spankings reported for that year was\nsix. The college students were then asked what percentage of the time they thought\nit was effective.\nHow does the principle of inevitability analyze this result? If the average number\nof spankings from recall was about six, how consistently do you think spanking was\napplied for a specific target misbehavior over a year\u2019s time period? I know I\nmisbehaved more than six times when I was 8 years old. Six times might have covered\n1 week\u2019s worth of misbehavior for me. What about the other 51 weeks of the year?\nAlso consider this: My parents and teachers considered me a well-behaved child.\nLet\u2019s construct hypothetical data to exemplify this argument. Let\u2019s say, for\nargument sake, that some of these people were spanked when they yelled at their\nmother. If they yelled at their mother about twice a week, on average, how many\ntimes over a year would that sum to? About 104, give or take some. Now, these people\nreported that they were spanked six times. Therefore, roughly 6% of the time they\nwould yell at their mother, they got spanked. That is not even close to being\nconsistent. Any approach that is used 6% of the time is probably not going to\nsucceed. With this type of speculative analysis, can you see why you should not\nconclude spanking is ineffective from the Strauss data? We just do not know enough\nat this time to conclude whether spanking works.\nHow Important is the Immediacy of the Consequence?\nA behavioral contingency specifies that a behavior is followed in close temporal\nproximity by a consequence. How close is close? For many children, telling them\nthat they earned a point, or lost a point, when the behavior occurs, works well. With Six Basic Principles of Punishment 111\nlanguage, humans are able to bridge the gap between when a behavior occurs and\nwhen the consequence is invoked. The child may not get to have extra free time until\nlater that afternoon when he has earned all his points, but such an arrangement still\nmaintains his low levels of target behavior. In this case, the verbal instruction, \u201c you\nearned points\u201d (or lost points) serves as a bridge to the eventual delivery or lack\nthereof, and is called a conditioned reinforcer (or conditioned punisher).\nThe younger the child, the less likely such verbal instructions will be able to\nbridge the gap. Children with developmental delays may also need consequences\nthat occur in close proximity to the target behavior in order for the behavior to\ndecrease in frequency. Particularly when dealing with young children, the conse-\nquence may have to occur at the initial part of the chain of events that comprises the\ntarget behavior. For example, a 2-year-old plays close to a curtain and begins tugging\non it. If the parent catches the child after he has pulled on it 5-10 times, which is too\nlate (in my clinical experience). Whatever pleasure the child has derived from pulling\non the curtains has probably already occurred. One can rest assured that the next\ntime the opportunity presents itself, the child will not feel any inhibition whatsoever\nto go and pull on the curtain.\nIn order to make a punishing consequence effective, the parent would need to\nbe more vigilant than he currently is, and catch the child right as she touches the\ncurtain. Better yet, pair a warning (e.g., \u201cDon\u2019t touch!\u201d) with the delivery of the\npunisher as she touches the curtain. Once the punishing event has reduced the\nbehavior, the warning can be given before she touches the curtain. The parent gives\nthe warning right when his daughter is in the vicinity, looking at the curtain and\nthinking how wondrous it would be to touch the curtain. If the warning does not\ninhibit the grabbing of the curtains, and she touches the curtain, the consequence\nneeds to be applied as before. However, it is essential in some cases to catch the early\nparts of the chain, as this research study described attests to.\nAn Effective Immediate Consequence Solves a Life-threatening\nProblem.\nSome infants develop serious, medical, life threatening conditions as a result of\nrumination. Rumination is the regurgitation of food or liquid (once swallowed) and\nsubsequent ejection of such from the mouth. If such behavior produces significant\nloss of food intake over a period of time, dehydration, malnutrition and lowered\nresistance to diseases can occur.\nA 6-month old infant was brought to the University of Mississippi Hospital in\nFebruary of 1972, for failing to gain weight for a second time in her short life because\nof persistent rumination (Sajwaj, Libet, & Agras, 1974). The presenting problem\nconsisted of the following scenario. Upon being fed milk, Sandra would begin a\nchain of behaviors, starting with forward and backward tongue thrusting, which\nresulted in the milk being brought back into the mouth area. From there it would\nflow out for about a 10-20 minute period, at which time there appeared to be no milk\nleft from the original feeding. It was important for these researchers to analyze all\nparts of the chain of events that resulted in regurgitation of the milk. Intervening with 112 Section III\na punisher once the milk started spilling out of the child\u2019s mouth would have\nprobably been too late. The early part of the rumination scenario would have to be\nhalted via the delivery of a powerful contingent event.\nFollowing a baseline assessment of the percentage of time Sandra was engaged\nin rumination following a feeding, a contingent procedure called lemon juice\ntherapy was administered. (Note to reader: Not something to be tried at home by novices.)\nAs soon as the vigorous tongue movements began, 16 cc of unsweetened lemon juice\nwas immediately squirted into her mouth with a syringe. This consequent event was\napplied each time the tongue thrusting occurred by nursing staff under supervision.\nA second application was administered if tongue thrusting persisted after a 30-60\nsecond period elapsed (to avoid lip smacking from the sour sensation of the lemon).\nThe baseline analysis revealed that rumination was occurring at a rate of 40-70%\nof the time in a 20-minute period following a feeding. Again, this typically led to a\nloss of all the milk initially swallowed during the feeding. In the first session in which\nlemon juice was applied, 12 injections of lemon juice were administered. Over the\nnext 15 feedings, the number of applications of the contingent lemon juice was\nbetween one and six.\nThe rate of rumination decreased remarkably. By day 12, no more milk was\nobserved in the mouth, only occasional tongue thrusting (but not followed by\nregurgitation of milk). By day 23, the percentage of ruminative behavior was either\nzero or near zero. The desired effect of decreasing rumination on Sandra\u2019s health was\nobtained. Sandra\u2019s weight increased and she was discharged back to her foster\nparents. A 1-year follow-up of her progress put her weight at the 25th percentile for\ninfant girls.\nWhat is the Effectiveness of a Punisher if One Can Escape It?\nAnother related point to the consistency principle is the delivery of the\ncontingency in its intended fashion. For example, if you designate the removal of TV\nprivileges as a consequence for failing to do homework, are you able to carry this out\nto its full extent? Or do mitigating conditions arise which frequently have you\n\u201cgiving in\u201d after 15 minutes? If this happens often enough, do you think that the rate\nof doing homework will be changed for the better? The answer is intuitive, but there\nare studies that prove the point.\nDr. Nathan Azrin and colleagues empirically demonstrated what happens when\nyou allow the subject to escape the punishing consequence (Azrin, Hake, Holz, &\nHutchinson, 1965). In the first part of the experiment, the researchers taught pigeons\nto peck at a select key. Subsequently, they began punishing the key peck response,\nand obtained a marked decrease in pecking that key. In the next phase of the\nexperiment, the bird was then allowed to press a second key. Pecking this key resulted\nin the pigeon getting out of that situation in which key pecks were punished. In very\nlittle time, the birds pressed the escape key frequently (imagine that!) after pressing\nthe first key to get food. Of course, the effect of the punishing consequence on\npecking the first key is negligible. Six Basic Principles of Punishment 113\nEscaping punishment and therefore mitigating its effectiveness to decrease\nbehavior can take on unusual forms in both the animal and human realm. In\nexperiments with rats, shock is delivered to the foot of the rat each time it presses the\nbar. In order for the shock to occur, the feet apparently have to be on the grid of the\nfloor. I never ran these kinds of experiments when I was in school so I am surmising\nthis from the written study. One particular rat must have had a genetic gift for\nadapting to severe conditions. This rat would lie down and press the bar from\nunderneath, so that it would not have its feet to the grid. This clever manner of\npressing the bar thereby avoided the shock that came with bar pressing. There is a\npicture of this animal in a book (Fantino & Logan, 1979), and it is entitled \u201cbreakfast\nin bed.\u201d You may have to see the picture to appreciate the humor. Anyway, the\ncontingent shock did nothing to eliminate this rat\u2019s bar pressing. Organisms are\nclever! Where there is a will to escape, there is often a way.\nWhat is the human analogue to unauthorized escape from the punishing event?\nHow about kids who say they are sorry, and the time-out is concluded by the parent\n(\u201cWell, they said they were sorry, and I believe them\u201d). How about kids who cry\nduring time-out? Have you ever wondered why they cry when they are placed in\ntime-out? I don\u2019t believe that time-out encompasses any painful intrusive physical\nstimulus. It is not like they are sitting on hot coals. Put two and two together. If they\nare eventually taken out upon crying (could be 30 seconds one time, 2 minutes the\nnext), what do you think they have stored in their little neurons as relevant\ninformation when in time-out? The rule: If you want to get out of time-out, cry\nlonger and harder. You now see how real life develops rules about what behaviors\nescape punishing conditions.\nWhat effect does the inability to implement the consequence in the intended\nfashion have on the target child behavior? The inability to fully implement the\npunishing consequence would most probably weaken its effect, potentially render-\ning it ineffective. Many people who claim to have used a consequence allow the child\nto escape it, usually with a certain level of pleading, whining, and other really\nundesirable escape-motivated behaviors. After all, how many children have actually\nbeen grounded till Christmas?\nPrinciple III: The \u201cEven Swap\u201d Rule\nThe principle of the \u201ceven swap\u201d involves the complimentary use of reinforce-\nment for some desirable behavior in conjunction with the use of a punishing\nconsequence for the target undesirable behavior. In many behavior analysis classes\nat the undergraduate and graduate level, professors extol the need to include positive\nreinforcement for some alternate behavior as well as punishment contingencies for\nthe problem behavior. While this again seems intuitive, it may not be practiced in\napplied settings.\nUpon being granted my Ph.D. from Florida State University in 1979, I worked\non a unit of a state institution in Wisconsin for persons with disabilities. One day\nin the beginning of my tenure, I came upon a client engaging in self- injury while 114 Section III\nseveral staff sat back and appeared to be practicing relaxation techniques. I felt that\nthere should be some action on their part, and was amazed that they did not feel\ncompelled to remotely look like they were intervening in some way. This tells you\nhow much influence I had at the time.\nAfter awhile, when it was evident that this was apparently standard operating\nprocedure, I asked them, \u201cWhat behavioral plan has been developed for this\nindividual\u2019s self-injury?\u201d They remarked, \u201cOh, we are ignoring him so that he will\nstop doing that. You know, ignoring the behavior to make it go away.\u201d Well there\nyou have it. There was a good explanation for what I observed. \u201cOk, I can see that.\nAnd you are doing a fine job of ignoring that behavior as well as anything else he\ndoes. If ignoring works the way you say it does, why in no time at all, he will be void\nof any behavior. Why, with the adroit skill with which you are ignoring him, he may\neventually return to an amoeba, a single cell state. Keep up the good work.\u201d\nLook What Happened in the Laboratory\u2014 Combining\nReinforcement with Punishment.\nSarcasm aside, complementing punishment with reinforcement is not just a\ncatchy phrase. Researchers at Anna State Hospital examined this principle by\nmeasuring the key peck behavior of pigeons under two different circumstances (Holz\n& Azrin, 1963). The first condition was similar to many other studies. Once the key\npeck response was established by food reinforcement, punishment via shock was\ndelivered for key pecks. These procedures test how well punishment will inhibit a\nbehavior that has already been developed under reinforcement. Under this condi-\ntion, three birds had the following average rates (across multiple sessions) of key peck\nresponses respectively: 3, 23, and 93 (that last bird- talk about failing to profit from\nexperience).\nIn the second condition, using other pigeons, the same key resulted in\npunishment. However, another key was made available which resulted in food for\nkey pecks, but no punishment for pecking it. The rate of key pecks to the key that\nresulted in punishment dropped dramatically for all three birds respectively: 0, 0,\nand 1. Of course this now makes sense. With another venue for obtaining food, one\nthat did not require them to sustain shock, the results make sense.\nHow Does this Apply to a Parent\u2019s Use of Punishing Consequences?\nThe even swap rule has tremendous implications for parents. The objective to\nreduce a child\u2019s target problem behavior is made more probable if you can combine\npunishment of a target behavior with reinforcement of an alternate behavior.\nUnfortunately, too often, parents (and others) jump to the use of a consequence for\nthe target problem behavior. As you will see, it is just as effective, or more so, to\ndecrease a target behavior by building something to take its place. I teach the\nfollowing to students and parents alike: Every time you want to target a specific\nundesirable behavior for a decrease, concurrently determine what behavior(s) you\nwant to increase. In this manner, there will be an even swap (i.e., reducing an\nundesirable behavior while developing an appropriate replacement). Six Basic Principles of Punishment 115\nThe punishers that involve a removal of reinforcement for target behavior\ninherently take advantage of reinforcement. For that reason, I highly recommend\ntheir use. For example, let us say that a parent wants to target her son\u2019s aggressive\nbehavior toward his younger sister. If the behavioral contingency is that the child\nloses a half an hour off bedtime that night for hitting his sister, he concurrently gains\nthat privilege if he does not hit his sister during the day. Hence reinforcement and\npunishment are at work, hand in hand. The case below illustrates the even swap\nprinciple with a unique problem.\nThe Case of the Intimate Disclosure\nWe received a referral for a 21-year-old female, Clarine, with a very\nunique, but problematic behavior. Clarine had mild mental retardation\nand lived with foster parents subsequent to her being taken out of her\nfather\u2019s home (the reason will be apparent in a minute). She was a fairly\ncapable and pleasant individual and could engage in a variety of tasks that\nwould allow her to gain paid employment with some help. At the time of\nthe referral, she was working at a convalescent hospital and was being\ntrained by any agency to gain and maintain that place of employment.\nHer work at the hospital seemed to meet everyone\u2019s expectations, but\nshe was to be fired from her job for a reason other than her ability to make\na bed. Clarine made friends easily, perhaps too easily. She would initiate a\nconversation with the patients at the hospital in an appropriate manner\n(this attention is often a welcome event in these patients lives). However,\nwithout a moments notice, she would begin talking with them as if they had\nbeen hired as her psychiatrist or social worker. What am I referring to? In\nmid conversation, she would provide explicit details about her biological\nfather sexually abusing her (in graphic details) as well as a rape that occurred\nto her when she was in school. The conversation might start with, \u201cHi, my\nname is Clarine, what is your name. How are you doing? Do you like it here?\nDo you want to hear how my father undressed me and *******?\u201d\nThe staff person who worked with her had tried many strategies to get\nher to stop disclosing all the intricacies of her unfortunate past, but to no\navail. Imagine the reaction you would have if you were a patient in this\nhospital. Here comes a pleasant individual who wants to make conversation\nwith you. Your agenda is not entirely filled up on this particular day, so you\ngreet her with a smile. The conversation is pleasant and seems to be going\nalong fine and then you do a double take, discounting the possibility that\nyou heard ******. Nope there is nothing wrong with your ears. Your smile\nturns to a look of apprehension and finally, distaste. As you might guess,\nClarine did not pick up on some subtle cues that one\u2019s interest had turned\nto aversion for her story. The patient\u2019s attention was all that mattered, and 116 Section III\nsuch was being given in abundance for her remarks about her unfortunate\npast life.\nTo complicate matters, this probable attention from patients would\nmake it more difficult to eliminate such a behavior. One could not count\non this attention to stop in the near future. It would be improbable to get\neveryone at her work site, as well as visitors to agree to ignore this one worker\nwhen she said, \u201c**********.\u201d I don\u2019t believe the Americans with Disabilities\nAct would extend that far in terms of a reasonable accommodation. This\nsituation required that we come up with a strategy that would make it more\nuncomfortable for her to engage in this behavior. Additionally, the planned\nconsequence needs to override the social attention such behavior probably\nreceives.\nThe administrators at the hospital were adamant about her leaving, and\nfired her. Luckily another job at a day care was procured by her social\nworker. My behavioral specialist and I felt that it was essential to have a plan\nin place that would be so powerful that it would make Clarine think twice\nbefore launching into her sermon. Prior to Clarine showing up at her new\nposition, my behavioral specialist worked with the foster parents to teach\nthem how to use evening privileges as a consequent event. If Clarine had\nan incident at work that day, all evening privileges were revoked. She would\nbasically become bored until she went to sleep that night. Tomorrow was\nanother day when she could keep or lose that evening\u2019s privileges.\nWhat would she have to do to lose evening privileges? You guessed it.\nEach day the supervisor would report to the staff aide helping Clarine about\nany incident of inappropriate conversation. If any incident occurred, this\nwas conveyed to her parents and privileges were revoked that evening.\nConversely, if she kept her conversation in tow, then she did not lose\nevening privileges. Additionally any chores at work that were assigned, and\nnot completed due to lack of motivation on her part would also result in\nher evening privileges being revoked.\nApparently this consequence struck fear into Clarine. Not one single\nmajor incident of inappropriate disclosure occurred at the day care within\nthe first 2-months. This plan was effective because it provided a powerful\nconsequence for inappropriate disclosure as well as a reinforcing condition\nif she did not disclose such facts while at work.\nThis case is instructive for another reason as well. Sometimes a\npunishing consequence has to be used to override the effects of a powerful\nsocial reinforcer that the behavior frequently produces, because people are\npeople! When some people do or say wacky things, other people stand up\nand take notice, and laugh and attend. Overriding this built-in reinforce-\nment for intimate disclosures required the foster parents to remove\npreferred events when such occurred. While other people may have felt that\nClarine needed to talk about this earlier trauma in her life, my position was Six Basic Principles of Punishment 117\nthat its indiscriminate occurrence was not healthy for anyone. Subsequent\nto the success of this program, I do not see that Clarine\u2019s emotional health\nsuffered because we punished such a disclosure. In fact, Clarine was better\nfor it and I\u2019m sure the day care was also happy with the result.\n\u2022 Why do you think Clarine engaged in such intimate disclosures with\nstrangers?\n\u2022 Do you believe the intervention negatively affected Clarine\u2019s ability to\ndeal with her past? Why or why not?\nPrinciple IV: Remove Competing Consequences\nFiguratively speaking, have you ever dug a hole and then had someone fill it back\nup? Then you dug the same hole a second time and again to your dismay, found that\nsomeone filled it back up? What would be your reaction if you found out that\nsomeone was hired to fill up holes you dug, which you were completely unaware of.\nOf course you would feel like your work was in vain.\nThe same phenomenon can occur when punishing a behavior. If a child\u2019s\nproblem behavior is producing an unintended reinforcer, while a punishing event\nis being applied, the effect may be minimal. If this exists, it certainly mimics the\nillustration of the example of the hole digging and subsequent refilling.\nThe noted behavioral therapist and educator, the late Dr. Glen Latham, was a\nconsultant on a case that illustrates this principle nicely. Everyday, this boy in an\nelementary school would be sent down to the principal\u2019s office for some misbehavior\n(mistake #1: behavioral contingency missing). The consternation of the school was\nthat his behavior was getting worse, not better. This boy was apparently beyond any\nintervention known to mankind (since sending him to the principal\u2019s office only\nexacerbated the problem).\nDr. Latham went to visit the school one day early, wanting to see what this young\nboy did to result in his being sent to the principal\u2019s office. From his description, I\nventured that the office was the main gateway to the rest of the school. This must\nhave been a heavy traffic area in the morning. Unfortunately, Dr. Latham was too\nlate in arriving that day. This boy was already in the office! In fact, he appeared to\nhave taken on the role of official greeter of the school. Schoolmates, parents, and\nanyone who went by the office on their way to the classroom passed by him, and he\ndid his best to greet them all. He appeared to be pleased at this form of \u201cpunishment.\u201d\nHe looked like a kid who was locked in the candy store all night.\nOn the one hand, getting sent to the office means you will have to meet with\na possibly unfriendly principal and lose recess. On the other hand, you get one of\nthe neatest jobs in the school. Do you see the dilemma? One person digs the hole.\nThe other person fills it up.\nOften the use of time-out may provide a competing contingency, which wrecks\nhavoc on its ability to effect behavior change. I worked with one child whose mother 118 Section III\nwould send him to time-out in the afternoon. To my objection, he was sent to his\nbedroom. On one of my visits he had already been sent to his room. When I asked,\n\u201c Where is John?\u201d the mother told me he was in time-out. \u201cHow long has he been\nthere?\u201d Her reply, \u201cAbout 30 minutes.\u201d That long, I thought. Let\u2019s go have a look.\nAs she opened the door he was on his bed sleeping. I remarked, \u201cI\u2019ll bet he gets time-\nout every afternoon about this time.\u201d Yeah, she replies. He can be really cranky, and\nact mean to his sister, every afternoon like clockwork.\u201d Would you say time-out was\nworking for this child? For inducing sleep, yes. For aggression to sister, no.\nSometimes, parents or staff engineer competing consequences to avoid produc-\ning a punishment contingency as the two cases below illustrate.\nThe Case of: You Cannot Go to the YMCA Because You Hit\nSomeone- So Let\u2019s Go Out for Donuts\nA 13-year-old male, Barry, was housed in a group home in Central\nCalifornia. Barry was physically big for his age, and had frequent incidents\nof hitting the other residents. The owner of the facility requested that I set\nup a \u201cbehavior mod\u201d program for him. In addition to aggression to other\nresidents, Barry also was frequently noncompliant to staff requests, which\nwas a common occurrence with many residents in the home. He also had\na high rate of swearing, which also seemed to be an entry requirement for\nresidents of the facility.\nThese behaviors had not improved dramatically. Barry, along with the\nother residents, had group therapy weekly; group meetings with staff,\npsychiatric involvement, and a variety of point systems. In the latter case,\nobservation revealed that what consequences were delineated on paper did\nnot often transpire in real life.\nIn being given the assignment, I went over the records to determine\nwhat the rate of hitting other children was over the last several weeks. While\nthere were several incident reports when the victim received some injury,\nstaff noted that the actual rate of aggression was much higher, since\naggression that did not result in injury was not recorded. Hence, I found it\ndifficult to ascertain the true level of aggression.\nOne of the activities Barry and the other residents liked was going to\nthe YMCA. The YMCA had a pool and co-ed swimming. The residents of\nthe facility went three days per week. I asked if Barry, as well as other\nresidents, had to meet any behavioral criterion in order to go. The staff\nperson remarked, \u201cWell he has to be good.\u201d I then followed up with the\nfollowing question, \u201cHow many times in the last several weeks did he lose\nthe privilege of going with the group to the YMCA?\u201d Answer: \u201cNone.\u201d I\nthought to myself. \u201cOk, and this is the same kid that hits someone\neveryday? What is the definition of misbehavior we are using for Barry,\nmaiming or destroying someone?\u201d Six Basic Principles of Punishment 119\nIt seemed logical to me that we should set some more definitive\ncriteria for this potentially powerful reinforcing activity. The plan I drew\nup to impede the frequency of aggression toward other residents was the\nfollowing: An act of aggression toward another resident would remove his\nupcoming trip to the YMCA. For example, if he aggressed against someone\non Tuesday, he would miss the Wednesday evening outing. If he went from\nThursday to Saturday without hitting anyone he would then be allowed to\ngo on the Saturday night outing. I explained this to the house staff and the\nhouse manager. I was insured that staff would record each offense in\nwriting.\nI had expected that this consequence for aggressing against peers would\nput a huge dent in Barry\u2019s proclivity for hitting and punching. My follow-\nup visit 1-week hence was a huge disappointment. The records showed no\nreal significant change in his aggressive behavior. In fact, he missed all of\nthe scheduled YMCA trips. I was taken aback, and quite frankly did not\nknow why this had not succeeded. Maybe I misjudged his love of the\nYMCA.\nIn an inquisitive manner, I asked the staff person, \u201cWhen Barry misses\nout on the YMCA outing, he must be a bear to keep in the house. What do\nyou do with him?\u201d The answer from the staff came like a beaming light in\na dark room: \u201cOh, we cannot keep him home. He would go berserk and tear\nup the place. A staff person takes him for donuts, or he goes bowling.\u201d Ok,\nI see what was going on. If Barry did not earn one activity, we apparently\nprovided him with an alternate activity, hopefully one that was equally\npleasing. Of course, we avoided at all costs Barry getting upset because the\nconsequence for his aggressive behavior was not to his liking. Let us try to\ngive him a consequence for aggression that is something he will be relatively\nhappy with.\nIf you ever wondered why behavioral plans don\u2019t work, consider this\na primary example of what goes on when things don\u2019t work. If I had not\nasked some questions, I might have been under the assumption that this\nplan was ineffective in its design. No, the plan was not at fault here. The staff\nexpertly engineered a strong competing contingency.\n\u2022 Why did loss of YMCA activities as a consequence for aggression not\nwork in Barry\u2019s case?\n\u2022 How would you handle this problem? 120 Section III\nHe Likes to Be Restrained!\nIn the mid-1980s I was hired as a consultant for a training program for\npeople with developmental disabilities. The staff wanted me to assess clients\nwho had severe behavior problems, including aggression to staff and other\nclients. It was not uncommon for a client to have to be physically restrained\nas a result of his (or her) behavior being potentially dangerous to self or\nothers. The restraint would occur at a point where the client\u2019s behavior had\nescalated so that danger was imminent. The staff were well-trained in this\nprocedure and executed it in a safe and efficient manner when needed.\nWhile some clients only needed to be restrained every once in awhile,\nothers were restrained daily.\nOne client in particular was brought to my attention. His rate of\nbehavioral episodes where he had to be restrained was quite high. Why\nwould someone do something that results reliably in restraint? The staff\nreasoned that restraint should always function as a punisher, since no one\nin their right mind could actually like this. Therefore the staff\u2019s contention\nwas that his behavior was unpredictable, and probably the result of just\n\u201cgoing off.\u201d In the eyes of the staff, there was no alternative except to restrain\nhim. I thought, \u201cCould there be a competing consequence? What could he\npossibly be getting out of the restraint process, so that getting this event\nwould override the aversive aspect of the restraint?\u201d The answer? Coffee.\nAs reported by staff, he would be restrained when his state of aggressive\nbehavior reached the danger point. Two or more staff persons would put\nhim in a prone containment in a safe manner, preferably to a soft surface.\nAs he calmed down, they began a process of releasing him progressively,\nuntil he was standing erect again. They would then have him sit in a chair\nto calm down further, where he was giving lots of attention from staff,\nsoothing comments and coffee. The proof that coffee was the smoking gun\nwas the following piece of information I obtained. Prior to the incident, if\nhe asked for coffee, he would have been told he could not have any till lunch\nsince he just had some for breakfast. Now do you see the competing\nconsequences? Act up, get restrained, then 15-20 minutes later, you get\ncoffee. Don\u2019t act up, but ask nicely, you get no coffee. Do you see the\nchoice?\nPrinciple V: Be Specific\nI once read a report for a child, with a recommendation for treating his behavior\nproblems as the following. \u201cWhen he engages in good behavior, reinforce him. Of\ncourse when he engages in misbehavior, you should not reward him.\u201d Thank you\nfor that! Such words of wisdom are certainly worth the $130/hour fee rate from Six Basic Principles of Punishment 121\nwhoever provided that consultation. It is obvious that only someone with advanced\ngraduate training would have been able to produce such an insightful recommenda-\ntion! Clearly, their graduate training program did a fine job in teaching this mental\nhealth professional all she or he needs to know about using consequences.\nWhile this example is quite extreme, it often is the case that the exact nature of\nthe punishing consequence is not specified. For example, a recommendation such\nas \u201cignore the behavior\u201d does not constitute precise consequences. How long should\none ignore? What should one do when engaged in ignoring?\nIn the study cited earlier by Dr. Agras and colleagues (Sajwaj, et al., 1974) the\nconsequence of rumination was precisely specified (i.e., 16 cc of lemon juice squirted\ninto the client\u2019s mouth with a syringe). Each application should not have varied that\nspecification. This punishing consequence is precisely specified so that it will be\nadministered in the same fashion each time. If you decide to use certain procedures\nto effect change in your child\u2019s behavior, it is imperative that you adhere to this\nprinciple. The specification of the consequence should be delineated before\ninitiating the strategy. Do not fly by the seat of your pants, you will probably end\nup without pants!\nSome available instruments make specification more reasonable for everyday\nuse of consequences. I have often used a portable oven timer when measuring the\nlength of time-out. The number of times a child must correct some behavior as a\nconsequence can be delineated (e.g., if you fail to put the towel on the rack, you must\npractice this 10 times before eating lunch). Perhaps there is a necessary balance\nbetween the rigor required and obtained in research studies and the applications of\nparental consequences in Merritt Island, Florida. We may not get precision to the\nnth degree, but let\u2019s avoid ambiguity to the 5th exponent.\nPrinciple VI: Prove It Works\nThe development of basic principles of punishment were formulated from years\nof research in animal laboratories before such procedures were used with children,\nadolescents, and adults. Research findings have driven application and theory. We\ndo not have a theory regarding which events will always function as a punisher. For\nexample, claiming that spanking is necessary for child development because it\nteaches children right from wrong, is not something that can be proven across the\nboard (see example below). On the other hand, we also do not advocate that ignoring\na behavior will always be the best approach for parents to use in teaching their child\nto avoid certain patterns of behavior. When you hear that, it is not science, it is\ndogma. Punishment and reinforcement contingencies are determined in each\nindividual situation. One cannot simply be a time-out expert and be reliably effective\nin dealing with child problem behaviors.\nThe field of behavior analysis has taken the same basic track as other sciences.\nThe technology developed was the result of many studies conducted by experimen-\ntal and applied researchers over a 6-decade history. Rather than adopting unwavering 122 Section III\nloyalty to some manner of dealing with child behavior, testing of effective\nprocedures became the field\u2019s mainstay. The practical use of these procedures\noccurred once there was sufficient evidence that a behavioral effect was reliably\nobtained in several studies.\nOne should take heart in the progression of the application of behavioral\nprinciples from the early laboratory developments investigating the science of\nbehavior. There is no need to apologize anymore for the use of techniques derived\nfrom laboratory research conducted decades ago. If anything, the general populace\nshould be encouraged by this track. The apology should be forthcoming from\napproaches that have no empirical basis whatsoever, yet have run out to sell their\n\u201ctherapy wares\u201d to the market!\nThis rich history of findings about reinforcement and punishment effects in the\nlaboratory, led to the application of these principles to help people with real life\nproblems. Given the lineage of applied researchers in the 1950s and 1960s, there was\nan insistence on validating clinical procedures with real life problems before mass\nmarketing. One study would verify that some procedure had an effect on five\nchildren with disruptive levels of behavior. Then someone would conduct another\nstudy that used other children, with a different set of behaviors, verifying the\neffectiveness of that same procedure. The replication of successful results occurred\nmany times over before a procedure was granted empirical verification status. Below\nare research examples of such empirical verification.\nMedication is Not Always the Answer: Time-out Does Work.\nA 4-year-old child, Brian, who was diagnosed with emotional disturbance and\nmental retardation, attended a special school for children with these disorders at the\nUniversity of Washington (Shafto & Sulzbacher, 1977). Brian was often observed\nwandering aimlessly about the classroom. One of the major problems reported by\nstaff was that he engaged in frequent activity changes (operational definition of\nhyperactive behavior in this case). During the baseline condition, Brian\u2019s frequency\nof activity changes was simply recorded, with no special intervention occurring.\nFollowing a first baseline condition of 20 days, Brian was given 5 mg. of Ritalin,\ntwice daily, for four sessions. Again the rate of activity changes was accurately\nmeasured to assess the effects of this intervention in contrast to baseline. On the fifth\nsession, the teacher added a behavioral component to the medication intervention\nfor another 11 days. The teacher attended to him when he was engaged in\nappropriate play, as well as provided cereal reinforcement for staying with the toy or\nplay activity. The consequence for moving to another area before spending\nsignificant time with the current toy or activity was the withdrawal of attention and\nfood reinforcement.\nHow did that work? The medication combined with the behavioral strategy\nproduced substantial changes in child behavior. To demonstrate that the treatment\nwas the critical factor for the change of behavior, the researchers removed the\ntreatment. Guess what result that produced? When the medication and behavioral\ncontingency were removed, Brian went back to changing the play activity frequently. Six Basic Principles of Punishment 123\nWhat would Brian do if medication alone was used? In the next condition, a\ncomparison between 5 mg and 15 mg of Ritalin was assessed. Either dosage level did\nnot decrease his activity-changing behavior substantially from the prior baseline.\nThe article reported that the mother requested that the medication intervention be\nterminated earlier than desired by the researchers. Brian\u2019s mother was not happy with\nhis staying awake at night later and later. Following that abrupt change in plans, the\nbehavioral contingency was reinstituted. A return to behavioral intervention re-\nsulted in a decrease of activity changes, without any medication being given during\nthis time period.\nIn the above study, we know what caused the decrease in activity changes. It was\nthe behavioral contingency. Correlation studies do not allow for this cause and effect\nanalysis, despite many an author\u2019s insistence on claiming such. Not all research\nstudies are equally credible in concluding cause and effect.\nNeed Positive Practice at Staying in Your Seat (During Recess Time)?\nA unique application of a behavioral contingency termed positive practice was\nused for a 9-year-old student, Herbie. Herbie was fine when he was in his seat.\nHowever, when he got out of his seat, it was apparently not a quiet event. He was\ndisruptive, loud, aggressive to other third-grade children, and non-compliant. As a\nresult of these behaviors both his academic performance as well as his relationships\nwith the other children in the class deteriorated. Researchers at the University of\nMontana, under the direction of Dr. Phillip Bornstein, were involved to help the\nthird-grade teacher with Herbie\u2019s behavior (Bornstein, Hamilton, & Quevillon,\n1977).\nThe punishment contingency involved the following for each occurrence of\nout-of-seat behavior. First, Herbie was immediately informed that he had broken the\nrule (about staying in one\u2019s seat). Second, each infraction cost him three minutes at\nnoon (during recess time) to practice appropriate behavior. During that recess\nperiod, he had to: (1) recite the following rule, \u201cdo not get out of your seat without\npermission and (2) perform the following; raise your hand and upon being\nacknowledged by the teacher, ask permission to leave the seat.\nWhat should happen if Herbie refused to perform the practice regimen at recess?\nThese researchers also devised a unique way of dealing with any thoughts by this\nchild to defeat the plan. Herbie\u2019s refusal had an additional consequence: additional\ntime would be added for practice (meaning less time for noon recess). That additional\ncontingency was apparently very effective in shutting down the possibility of\nrefusing to engage in the practice regimen. Refusal only happened twice during the\nentire program.\nThe results showed the superiority of this punishment procedure over simply\nreminding Herbie about the rules. By the third day of this program, Herbie\u2019s rate of\nout-of-seat behavior dwindled from an average rate of 20 (when the teacher just stated\nthe rules to him) to less than 5. This study was important because it contrasts the\ndifferential results obtained under punishment versus other approaches. Another\ntest condition that proved ineffective was based on a counseling approach. The 124 Section III\nteacher was told that he should deal with the \u201creal inner problem\u201d in order to get\nHerbie to stay in his seat. In other words, talk to him and see what is the problem.\nWhile no one can say for sure how much \u201cdeep psychological analysis\u201d went on,\nwhatever transpired did not do much for Herbie\u2019s out-of-seat behavior. Getting to\nHerbie\u2019s inner thoughts, without positive practice consequences, had a deleterious\neffect on out-of-seat instances. The average rate jumped back to an unacceptable\nlevel; 18 daily occurrences during this period.\nWhile the rate of out-of-seat behavior during the punishment condition was\nmarkedly lower than it was during the other two test conditions, it was not yet at zero.\nThat was taken care of by adding a nice bonus (i.e., supplementing reinforcement\nwith punishment) to the program. Herbie had to count accurately his out-of-seat\nbehavior for the morning. If he was within one of the teacher\u2019s count, he earned a\nbonus of 15 extra recess minutes. This double edge contingency resulted in great\nimprovements, with about 50 days of 0 or 1 instance of out-of-seat behavior for the\nday. From 20 per day to 0 per day is success, of which there can be no argument.\nMention this study the next time someone says tells you that getting children to\nunderstand why they behave in a certain manner is all that is needed. It would be nice\nif that were all one needed to do to change child behavior. But unlike the inhabitants\non Freudania, we live on planet Earth. A Responsible Use of Punishment 125\nSection IV:\nA Responsible Use of Punishment\nIt should now be clear that understanding what constitutes punishment and\nhow it produces changes in child behavior can make you a more effective parent. All\nchildren, at one time or another, engage in behaviors that are undesirable. Using\nconsequences (both reinforcement and punishment) effectively can make such\nbehaviors not become a reliable pattern in children\u2019s dealings with their environ-\nment. Further, many effective punishing consequences can entail the removal of\nreinforcement, without resorting to physical means of consequating behavior. But\nthe use of consequences has more far reaching ramifications.\nI believe that part of becoming a well-functioning adult is based on an\nindividual\u2019s ability to endure unpleasant events and consequences. Unpleasant\nevents are part of everyday life. In some unfortunate circumstances, unpleasant\nevents are not even contingent upon one\u2019s behavior (e.g., sickness or death of a\nfamily member or friend). One of my colleagues, Dr. Merrill Winston from Florida,\nmade a clever analysis of life one night at a conference social event. (Note to reader:\nI did not inquire if he does his best thinking with an adult beverage or two in his system.) He\nremarked something along the following lines, \u201cOur ability as a species to profit from\npunishing events and bring our behavior in accordance with such contingencies is\na testament to our survival.\u201d That might well be the mantra for this book! If we are\nunable to profit from experiencing unwanted consequences, what would be our fate?\nIf we do not learn to dress warmly in environments where the temperature gets below\nzero, how long can we survive? It is important for us to learn to adjust our behavior\nas a function of unwanted consequences.\nLet me preach for just a minute. It is our job, our obligation, as parents, to teach\nour children how to behave in a manner that recruits social reinforcement. But I\nthink this is achieved only when children are accustomed to accepting consequences\nfor their behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to teach your child how to accept\nminimally to moderate unpleasant consequences, as part of growing up. As children\nget older, the consequences for behavior become more unpleasant, even though\nsuch consequences are not painful in any physical sense. If not making the little\nleague baseball team as a result of striking out during try-outs is tough to handle, it\nmay pale in comparison to losing one\u2019s job when you have four other people\ndepending on you.\nThe ability to accept consequences for one\u2019s behavior, in a manner that does not\nprovoke the social environment to \u201cpile on\u201d additional consequences determines a\nchild\u2019s adaptability to the social environment. People who exacerbate their level of\nundesirable behavior often make things worse for themselves in the long run.\nLearning to accept consequences as a child, I believe, leads one to develop as a stronger,\nemotionally-stable, adult. 126 Section IV\nAs adults many of us have learned that we cannot always get our way. The\ndifference between successful adulthood and the opposite is the ability to compe-\ntently handle (in an emotional sense) life\u2019s unpleasant circumstances. Dr. Dan\nGoleman wrote extensively about such in his groundbreaking book (Goleman,\n1995). I believe emotional intelligence is determined, to a large degree, by an\nindividual\u2019s ability to behave in an appropriate manner in the face of unpleasant or\nunwanted consequences.\nI have cited many cases in this book of children who not only improved their\nbehavior, but also improved their acceptance of consequences for undesirable\nbehavior. Their initial reaction to such consequences was often one of disdain for\ntheir parents or teachers. Some children initially displayed more severe reactions to\nimposed consequences, such as tantrums, screaming bouts, and aggression. How-\never, almost all these children by the end of the intervention period not only\nbehaved more appropriately (to avoid punishment), but also learned how to accept\nsuch consequences for their undesirable behavior. As parents, our objective is to\nteach our children how to face the music (both the good and the bad). In my opinion,\nproviding consequences for undesirable behavior, from an early age, is the best\nvehicle for accomplishing that objective.\nBefore delineating a model for using punishment responsibly and effectively,\na caveat is in order. I am not implying that everyone who reads this material should\nnow deploy punishing consequences. In some cases, a child\u2019s behavior may require\nmore than just a do-it-yourself approach. In these circumstances, it is best to get the\naide of an expert in applied behavior analysis. This person can consult with the\nparent and provide help in the design and implementation of the strategy. To learn\nmore about these professionals, go to www.bacb.com. For professionals wanting\nadditional information and training on behavioral practice, I have developed a 22-\nhour certificate program that is available on the internet. Go to www.alliant.edu/ce/\nonline/cipani.\nTo entertain whether you are ready to responsibly use punishment contingen-\ncies as an adjunct to reinforcement, ask yourself the following questions:\nAm I Willing to Solve One Problem Behavior at a Time?\nCan you resist the temptation to solve all of your child\u2019s problems in one felt\nswoop? A responsible use of punishing consequences entails the selection of one\ntarget behavior from a host of problems, and deploys the punishing consequence for\nthat behavior only. Both the research studies as well as the case examples I have\npresented illustrated this judicious use of a punishing consequence. Let us examine\nthe case of Barry, the future WWE wrestler. Was time-out used for all problem\nbehaviors? No! Its use was specific to aggressive behavior. It might have been\ntempting to address his many behavioral problems with time-out, but that probably\nwould have been disastrous. How consistent would Barry\u2019s mother have been if she\nhad to deploy time-out for multiple behaviors? Instead of 1 to 3 time-outs per day,\nshe would have had to deploy time-out 20 to 30 times per day. Can you see where\ntime-out will lose its potency? A Responsible Use of Punishment 127\nSimilarly with the case of aggressive behavior at Head Start, only aggressive\nbehavior on the playground resulted in time-out. Certainly there were other problem\nbehaviors that occurred on the playground (e.g., not coming in from recess in a\ntimely manner). However, using time-out as the contingency for the myriad of\nbehaviors on the playground would have probably led to inconsistent implementa-\ntion of time-out, thus gaining nothing.\nTake the necessary time to incrementally change your child\u2019s host of problem\nbehaviors. As my mother used to say, \u201cRome was not built in a day.\u201d It may take\nawhile for you to build your Rome, but believe me, the wait is well worth it. If you\nare willing to decide a priori what the consequence will be for a specific behavior, you\nhave taken your first step toward a responsible use of punishment.\nAm I Willing to Deploy That Consequence Consistently?\nDo you commit to consistency in the application of punishment consequences?\nThe toughest part of changing child behavior is the continuity needed in responding\nto every instance of the target behavior. Unfortunately, children do not engage in\nthe target behavior only when you are ready (physically, emotionally and intellec-\ntually) to deal with them. They can misbehave when you are at your lowest level of\nenergy. Everyone professes to be consistent. Will your actions back up your words?\nIn the case of Clarine, the inappropriate discloser, think of what a different\noutcome might have been generated if her parents or the staff person were\ninconsistent. Suppose the staff person who recorded her target inappropriate\ndisclosures had decided to sometimes let Clarine off with a warning? What do you\nthink she might have learned from this inconsistency? Clarine might have come\naway with the following, \u201cSometimes I lose privileges when I talk about these events\nto people at my job site, and sometimes I don\u2019t.\u201d It is important to remember that\nin this case, these inappropriate statements are unfortunately producing a reinforcer,\nattention from people. It was essential that the staff person assigned to work with\nClarine in her job-training program counted every instance of the target behavior.\nIt was also essential that the parents deployed the intended consequence for\ninappropriate disclosures when they occurred. The real heroes of this change in\nClarine\u2019s behavior were the staff person and Clarine\u2019s foster parents. Without their\ncommitment to inevitable consequences, Clarine would not have lasted long on her\nnew job. And that would be unfortunate, for both her self-esteem and social life. This\nplan taught Clarine that one could have a job and friends without having to disclose\nevery intimate detail of one\u2019s life.\nAm I Willing to Sit Down and Think Through a Plan Before Putting\nAnything into Action?\nEveryone wants to be a \u201cJohnny-on-the-spot,\u201d problem solver. Unfortunately\nmost people cannot effectively solve problems when the child is screaming because\nshe wants the \u201cfun meal,\u201d instead of the regular hamburger. Some parents solve this\ncrisis by giving the child the fun meal, once the screaming has reached major 128 Section IV\nproportions. Others threaten to take action but do not follow through with\nconsequences.\nMany of these child behavioral incidents repeat themselves over and over.\nWhile you may be caught off guard with the first screaming bout in the fast food\nrestaurant, what is your excuse when this has occurred repeatedly for two months?\nSit down, once you are away from the crisis situation, and work out a plan that deals\nwith the behavior. When screaming occurs the next time, you have already\ndetermined what to do.\nAm I Willing to Complement Punishment with Reinforcement?\nMany of the cases I have presented in this book as well as the research studies\nhave demonstrated that a physically punishing consequence is not usually necessary\nto change child behavior. Remember Jerry, the case where his mother tied him to a\nchair because she did not know what else to do? A natural inclination of some parents\nwould be to spank Jerry when his behavior reached that intolerable level. But\nspanking was unnecessary. His mother\u2019s use of the sit and decide technique,\ncombined with a reinforcement plan for increasing his compliance to parental\nrequests worked extremely well.\nIt is easy for some people to resort to a physically punishing consequence on the\nspur of the moment. I believe that too many things can go wrong when parents rely\nsolely on spanking as a consequence for misbehavior. Antonio presented a moun-\ntain of problems. Can you imagine what problems might have occurred if the plan\nwas for the grandmother to spank Antonio for arguing with his sister? Teaching his\ngrandmother the use of contingent bedtime resulted in substantial changes, without\nher needing to physically spank him.\nI want to add another imperative for you in deciding on a system of conse-\nquences for your child. Take it upon yourself to learn all you can about the power\nof positive reinforcement and behavioral skill training plans. While this material has\nfocused on punishing consequences and some of the myths perpetrated about\npunishment, do not take this as an indication of my sole use of such. To be an\neffective parent, you must spend time learning what advances the field of applied\nbehavior analysis has made with respect to building new behaviors in people\u2019s\nrepertoires. While I cannot go into great detail on these advancements, since\nappropriate treatment of this topic would require an entire book, let it be known that\nknowledge in this area is paramount. Become an enthusiastic consumer of behavior\nanalysis methods. A good place to start is the web site www.bacb.com.\nAm I Willing to Specify Precisely the Punishing Consequence for\nthe Target Behavior?\nThe specification of the length of the time-out period should not be, \u201cuntil he\nhas had enough.\u201d Specify where the time-out area will be located, how long the child\nwill remain there, and what the child will be required to do in order to be removed\nfrom time-out. A Responsible Use of Punishment 129\nSimilarly, if the removal of a privilege is to be the consequence, establish when\nthe privilege is to be given (or not given), the length of time the privilege is in effect,\nand what the alternate activity is if the privilege is not earned. \u201cUntil hell freezes\nover,\u201d is an unacceptable description of the length of time the child loses the\nprivilege.\nAm I Willing to Evaluate the Punisher\u2019s Effectiveness on the Target\nBehavior?\nDetermining the effectiveness of a behavioral plan requires the collection of\ndata every day. This adherence to the collection of data on the target behavior can\noften seem overzealous and nonessential to some. But it is the hallmark of effective\nintervention.\nIt is often difficult for parents to collect data on the daily rate of the target\nbehaviors. However, collection of data is essential to avoid making capricious\ndecisions about the effectiveness of a behavioral plan. When you change a plan, or\nconsider it to be ineffective, you should not do this on the basis of an emotional crisis\nthat is currently facing you. Crises can overwhelm your sense of judgment and\nappreciation of the successful history of the plan. Responding with changes in the\ndesignated plan with each new crisis leads to implementing a new plan frequently.\nEach new plan is judged ineffective with the next crisis. Pretty soon, you run out of\nplans.\nReview your child\u2019s progress on the target behaviors periodically. Let the child\u2019s\nlevel of progress guide you in your decision to continue (or not continue) the plan.\nAm I Willing to Persist Long Enough?\nToo many people throw in the towel too early. Consequences do not usually\nwork with just two applications. Keep in mind that we are not changing hair color,\nwe are changing child behavior of long-standing nature.\nAre you willing to persist beyond the possible escalation of a child\u2019s behavior,\nto the point of success. If children accepted consequences readily, then everyone\u2019s\nkids would be easy to handle and we would not have a huge commercial market for\nparenting books! Just because your child makes it difficult for you to remove the\nprivilege does not mean it should be discontinued as a consequence. The efficacy of\nthe punishing consequence is not judged on how well the child likes it. Particularly\nduring difficult times, your persistence is needed.\nThe cases I have presented in this book exemplify persistence. It was the parents,\nteachers, and adult care takers who are to be credited with changing behavior. If they\nwere less than resolute in their commitment to change the child\u2019s behavior, their\nstory would be like countless others I have worked with (i.e., a non-story or a sad\nstory). It is so often the case that a parent reports that the strategy has not worked,\nafter trying it once or twice. Realize that there is possibly nothing you can do once\nor twice to change your child\u2019s behavior. Your perseverance is the tool needed to\ndevelop your child\u2019s appropriate behaviors. It\u2019s up to you! No one said being a parent\nis easy, and your resolve will be tested time and time again. 130 Section IV\nAm I Willing to Be Open to Revising the Plan When It is\nIneffective?\nOn the one hand, you need to persist with a consequence until it demonstrates\nthat it is not going to be effective. However, plans that prove ineffective over a long\nperiod of time should be revised. If you are using time-out, and over a period of 4\nweeks the target behavior has not decreased even slightly over baseline, alter your\nplan. There should be no sacred cows. One\u2019s preference regarding the use of time-\nout should not take precedence over the requirement to change the child\u2019s problem\nbehavior.\nA story told to me by one of my professors illustrates this need for being sensitive\nto the efficacy of a plan (J. Bailey, personal communication, September, 22, 2002).\nHe was apparently raised on a ranch with horses. His father taught him how to shoe\na horse. Basically, the shoe is nailed into the horse\u2019s foot, which can obviously create\ndiscomfort (on the part of the horse). The person\u2019s sensitivity to the horse\u2019s response\nto each hit on the shoe determines whether there will be discomfort to the human\nperforming this delicate operation. Over time young boys in the southwest who\nbecome accomplished ranchers learn how to modify their approach to each horse,\nbeing sensitive to each horse\u2019s response, moment by moment. If you go and whack\naway, you will not last long in that business. Learn to be sensitive to the data. Treat\nit as if you are shoeing a horse.\nI will end Punishment on Trial with a case example. This case illustrates the\nresponsible use of punishing consequences in conjunction with reinforcement of\nappropriate social behaviors.\nCase Study- A Responsible Use of Punishment\nDarrian was a 4-year-old boy who was adopted by his paternal\ngrandparents, Felicia and Rinaldo. He had been with his grandparents for\nmore than half a year when I first made contact with this family. I asked\nFelicia why she was seeking help at the time. Her response was something\nto this effect, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how a kindergarten or first grade teacher will\nhandle him. I don\u2019t think he will get better just by getting older. If my\nhusband and I are hard pressed to deal with his constant misbehaviors day\nin and day out, what will someone who is not related to him do? I am\nworried that he will exit himself out of an educational experience because\nof his behavior, not because he can\u2019t learn.\u201d Both his grandparents\nattributed his lack of self-control to his poor upbringing, where little to no\nconsequences were enforced. This certainly seemed plausible from every-\nthing I had read or been told of by the adoptions worker.\nDarrian presented problems in both home and school environments.\nHe was frequently aggressive to his grandfather, hitting or kicking him with\nlittle provocation. He had severe tantrums when he was presented with a\nsituation that did not please him. Felicia relayed a poignant example of this A Responsible Use of Punishment 131\nto me. One day on the way to the YMCA preschool program, Felicia picked\nup her niece (Jodi) to take her to the YMCA as well. When they arrived at\nschool, Felicia opened the door and said, \u201cLet\u2019s let Jodi out first.\u201d Darrian\nflew into a rage. He got out of the car and threw himself on the sidewalk,\nperforming bad landscaping on the flowers and plants lining the sidewalk\nto the YMCA. Felicia got him up off the sidewalk, but Darrian was still in\na rage. She quickly ushered him into the class. As you can imagine, an hour\nlater, the YMCA called Felicia and insisted that she take Darrian home\nbecause he was uncontrollable. I guess you could say he was suspended\nfrom preschool.\nDarrian was also rude and aggressive to peers. As a result, very few of\nhis classmates at the YMCA played with him and he had very few friends\noutside of school. It was reported that he could not play for longer than a\nfew minutes before fighting or name-calling erupted. At school he was also\nnon-compliant to teacher instructions and did not follow school rules.\nSubsequently he was frequently in trouble and the YMCA preschool was\nconsidering his expulsion.\nDarrian had numerous problems. Felicia, Rinaldo and I agreed that it\nwas essential to target each of his many problems separately, and not to\nintervene in too many problems at one time. Rome was not built in a day.\nDarrian\u2019s behavior change would not be either. We decided to target\naggression to Rinaldo first. The consequence for aggression was a swiftly\nimplemented time-out. I believed time-out would be perfect for teaching\nDarrian to engage in playful, appropriate behavior with Rinaldo while\nteaching him to restrain himself from aggression during such interactions.\nIn the first two weeks, time-out produced the desired change. In that period,\nDarrian required only four time-outs. Additionally, he also learned how to\nbehave once he was placed in time-out. Given the success achieved in the\nhome environment, we then focused on his problems at school.\nAt school, he was also aggressive to classmates. We agreed that time-out\nwould probably work at school as well. Felicia went to the teacher to request\ntheir use of time-out for this problem. Upon hearing that she was being\nasked to use time-out with Darrian, the teacher remarked to Felicia, \u201cDr.\nCipani\u2019s recommendation goes against everything I was taught at the junior\ncollege about child behavior. Time-out is an abusive and ineffective strategy\nto deal with child problems, let alone Darrian\u2019s problems. Don\u2019t you think\nthat we know more than Dr. Cipani about Darrian\u2019s needs? Time-out is\ninhumane.\u201d (Note to reader: Apparently kicking him out of preschool is the more\nhumane approach!)\nOnce Felicia convinced the teacher to go along with the time-out,\npointing to its success in the home, I met with the teacher. She agreed to\nuse it in school for Darrian\u2019s aggressive behavior. Within a few applications\nof time-out, its effect at school was pronounced. The teacher was elated with 132 Section IV\nDarrian\u2019s progress. In one of my last follow-up visits to the preschool\nprogram, the teacher made the following remark, \u201c You know, you should\ngo to the junior college and teach them how to use time-out.\u201d She went from\nbeing a great detractor of time-out to championing its cause across the land.\nAt home, with aggressive behavior at a very low level, we targeted\nanother major problem area. Darrian, like many young children, presented\ndifficulty in getting ready for school in the morning. The plan designed\nmade Darrian\u2019s access to TV in the morning a function of his being ready\nfor school. Once Darrian was dressed, groomed, and ate breakfast, he then\nwatched TV until it was time to get in the car. If he did not get ready on time,\nhe lost morning TV. Within the first two weeks, Felicia reported that there\nwas no longer a problem getting Darrian ready for school on time.\nAnother problem area was bedtime. Darrian like many other 4-year-old\nchildren, hated to go to bed. He tried everything to postpone bedtime. The\n$10,000 question is: \u201cWhat consequence can be used to have Darrian get\nto bed on time?\u201d The answer came in the form of a tradition in many\nhouseholds, the bedtime story. Felicia or Rinaldo read Darrian a bedtime\nstory each night. What if a bedtime story was provided only if Darrian\nearned it? If Darrian was in bed by a certain time, he was read a story.\nHowever, if he was not, then it was end of story, lights out. He must have\nliked his stories because this problem area changed for the better within a\nshort period of time with this contingency.\nDarrian\u2019s compliance to simple directives was also addressed. Rinaldo\nand Felicia were taught how to be more effective in compliance situations\n(Cipani, 1999). I also introduced a structured game to improve Darrian\u2019s\ncompliance, called, \u201cThe Get Me Game.\u201d This game involves the parent\ndeveloping compliance by repeatedly reinforcing instruction following\nbehavior in a short period of time (go to www.geocities.com/voivod00 for\nmore information on this game).\nThe intervention effort over a 3 month period, targeted many behav-\niors, systematically, with success. I administered a behavioral assessment\ninstrument, the Conner\u2019s Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) at two points during\nmy involvement. I administered the CPRS prior to any behavioral plan\nbeing implemented (called the baseline assessment). I then administered\nthe same CPRS three months after baseline. The change from baseline to\nthe 3-month assessment is depicted below for 3 categories of the CPRS. The\nscores are reported as standard scores.\nConner\u2019s Score baseline 3 months\nLearning problems 65* 58\nImpulsive-hyperactive 65* 58\nHyperactivity index 67* 57\n*clinically significant above the norm A Responsible Use of Punishment 133\nDarrian\u2019s score in each of the three categories dropped to within\nnormal limits over the course of the intervention effort. It was evident to\nall who were in daily contact with Darrian that he had changed for the\nbetter.\nRome was not built in a day. Darrian took 3 months. 134 Section IV 135\nReferences\nAlexander, R.
