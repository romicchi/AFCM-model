Christopher Blair 4\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Dr. Christopher Blair\nGenetics\nBIO2450L\nLab 1\nProbability, Statistics, and Measurements\nThe goal of this laboratory is to provide an introduction to basic concepts and techniques\ncommonly used to study genetics. The first portion of the lab is devoted to the concept of\nprobability and how we can use basic probability theory to understand genetic concepts and\ncrosses. Genetic crosses are commonly used to study patterns of inheritance of traits. A trait,\nor a character, is generally any observable phenotypic characteristic of an organism such as\neye color, skin color, height, etc. Gregor Mendel, often considered the father of genetics,\nperformed many genetic crosses to quantify patterns of inheritance in pea plants. Based on the\nresults of his experiments he came up with three laws:\nLaw 1: Law of Segregation\nAlleles in diploid individuals separate during the process of gamete formation (meiosis).\nRemember that a diploid cell contains two sets of chromosomes, one from the father and one\nfrom the mother. Thus, each gene will contain two alleles. The alleles can either be the same\n(homozygous) or different (heterozygous). For example, if we assume that pea pod color (green\nversus yellow) is controlled by a single gene with two alleles (R and r), RR and rr would\nrepresent homozygotes and Rr would indicate a heterozygote. During gamete formation, only\none of the two alleles will be passed on to the sperm or egg. In other words, the two alleles\nsegregate from one another (see Fig. 1).\nLaw 2: Law of Independent Assortment\nDifferent genes randomly sort their alleles during the process of gamete formation\n(meiosis).\nFor example, going back to Mendel\u2019s experiments with pea plants, suppose we are working with\ntwo genes we will call Gene 1 and Gene 2. Gene 1 controls pea pod color and consists of two\nalleles (R = green, r = yellow). We assume that the R allele is dominant, meaning that RR and\nRr genotypes produce green pods and rr genotypes produce yellow pods. Now assume that\nGene 2 controls seed pod shape and also contains two alleles (Y = constricted, y = round).\nAssume that Y is dominant over y, such that YY and Yy genotypes produce constricted pods\nand yy genotypes produce round pods. Mendel\u2019s Law of Independent Assortment states that the\nalleles at these different genes will sort independently of one another during gamete formation.\nIn other words, the R allele will not always be associated with the Y allele and the r allele will not\nalways be associated with the y allele in each sperm or egg cell. All combinations of alleles are\npossible (Fig. 1).\nProf. Christopher Blair 5\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Law 3: Law of Dominance\nA heterozygous individual will express the phenotypic characteristics of the dominant\nallele.\nFor example, in our green versus yellow plant example, we say that the green allele (R) is\ndominant to the yellow allele (r) because both RR and Rr plants demonstrate the green\nphenotype.\nFig. 1. Meiosis in pea plants depicting Mendel\u2019s\nLaws of Segregation and Independent\nAssortment. Refer to PowerPoint slides for\ncolor version.

First, we will\nneed to understand basic probability theory and how it can be used to predict the likelihood of\nparticular outcomes.\nPart 1: Probability and Statistics\nProbability can be defined as the chance that any particular outcome will occur. For example,\nwhat is the probability of tossing a coin and obtaining heads? The answer would be \u00bd or 50%.\nThus,\n!\"#$%& !\" !\"#$% ! !\"#$%&\u2019(\"# !\"!#$ !\"## !\"\"#$\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 =\n!\"#$% !\"#$%& !\" !\"##$%&\u2019 !\"#$!%&\u2019\nProf. Christopher Blair 6\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Going back to our coin-flipping example, we asked what the probability would be of flipping a\nheads on one try. Thus, the numerator (number of times a particular event will occur = 1) and\nthe denominator = 2 (there are only two possible outcomes, heads or tails).\nWhat would be the probability of drawing a black card from a deck of cards on one try? What\nwould be the probability of drawing the King of Hearts from a deck of cards on the first try?\nA) Random sampling error\nWhen calculating probabilities, random sampling error can cause deviations from predicted\nprobabilities. For example, if you tossed a coin six times you would predict that 50% of the\ntosses would be heads and 50% would be tails. However, it would be possible that you tossed\nheads twice and tails four times, leading to a high random sampling error and a deviation from\nthe expected value of 50%. Conversely, if you tossed the same coin 1000 times it is highly likely\nthat the number of heads and tails would be closer to 50%. Let\u2019s try this out in a few exercises.\nWorking in pairs, each group will obtain a deck of cards, a coin, and a dice. For each\nobject, two tests will be conducted, one with a low sample number and one with a high\nsample number. This will enable us to determine the influence of random sampling error\non our outcomes.\nCoin test (10 flips)\nExpected Observed Difference\nHeads\nTails\nCoin test (100 flips)\nExpected Observed Difference\nHeads\nTails\nCards test (20 cuts)\nExpected Observed Difference\nSpades\nClubs\nHearts\nDiamonds\nProf. Christopher Blair 7\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Cards test (100 cuts)\nExpected Observed Difference\nSpades\nClubs\nHearts\nDiamonds\nDice test (30 rolls)\nExpected Observed Difference\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour\nFive\nSix\nDice test (120 rolls)\nExpected Observed Difference\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour\nFive\nSix\nWhat can you conclude from these observations? How does sample size influence\noutcomes with respect to expectations? How do your results compare with other groups?\nAlthough simply visualizing the results in a table can give a sense of how much the observed\nvalues deviate from the expected values, statistical tests can provide a more quantitative\nframework for hypothesis testing. Many statistical analyses require a null hypothesis that\nassumes no significant difference between treatments, events, or values. For example, in our\nexperiment one null hypothesis would be that there is no significant difference between the\nexpected and observed number of cards in each suit. We can test the null hypothesis using a\nstatistical technique called a chi square (\u03c72) test. In general, a low \u03c72 is consistent with the null\nhypothesis, whereas a large \u03c72 might lead us to refute the null hypothesis. How do you know if a\nvalue is large enough? First, let\u2019s see how we actually calculate \u03c72. The formula is relatively\nsimple:\nProf. Christopher Blair 8\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu !\n(!!!)\n!\n\u03c7 =\n!\nwhere\nO = the observed data\nE = the expected data based on the null hypothesis\n\u2211 = summation over different categories\nIf we had two categories, the \u03c72 would be calculated as\n! !\n(! ! ! ) (! ! ! )\n\u03c7! = ! ! + ! !\n! !\n! !\nOnce we have a \u03c72 value we need to determine if it is statistically significant. This is\naccomplished using a \u03c72 table (see table below). The values inside the table represent\ncalculated \u03c72 values. Before we can either accept or reject the null hypothesis we need to\ndetermine our alpha (P-value) and degrees of freedom (df). P-values can be interpreted in\nmultiple ways. For example, suppose we obtained a \u03c72 of 0.016 with 1 df. Based on the table,\nrandom chance alone would produce a \u03c72 value greater than 0.016 over 90% of the time (see\nbold square in table). In most statistical hypothesis testing we adopt an alpha (P-value) of 0.05\nor 5%. Examining the table, with 1 df we would need a \u03c72 > 3.841 (known as the critical value) in\norder to reject the null hypothesis of no significant difference between observed and expected\nvalues. Degrees of freedom is obtained by subtracting 1 from the total number of categories (n \u2013\n1). For example, in our cards example df = 3.\nProf. Christopher Blair 9\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Working in groups of two, perform six \u03c72 analyses using the data from the tables above.\nWhat can you conclude from your analysis?\nB) The product rule\nWe can use an approach called the product rule to determine the probability of multiple events\noccurring. For example, what is the probability of flipping a coin five times and obtaining heads\neach time? To determine this, we can simply multiply the probability of each independent event\noccurring:\n\u00bd x \u00bd x \u00bd x \u00bd x \u00bd = 1/32 = 0.03125 = 3.125%\nWhat is the probability of drawing a diamond card three times in a row?\nWhat is the probability of rolling a six 10 times in a row?\nWhat is the probability of flipping heads 20 times in a row?\nC) Binomial expansion\nNote that the product rule is used to determine the probability of ordered events. It can be used\nto determine the probability of outcomes in succession. For example, what is the probability of\ndrawing 10 red cards in a row from a standard deck of 52 cards? Conversely, the binomial\nexpansion equation can be used to determine the probability of unordered events. For\nexample, if a couple were to have seven children, what would be the probability that four are\nboys and three are girls? The binomial expansion equation is as follows:\n!!\n! !!!\n\ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5e\n!! !!! !\nProf. Christopher Blair 10\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu where P = the probability that the unordered outcome will occur\nn = the total number of events.\nx = the number of events in one category (e.g. number of males)\np = individual probability of x.\nq = individual probability of other category.\nThe symbol \u2018!\u2019 represents factorial. For example, 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.\nIn this example,\nn = 7\nx = 4\np = 0.5\nq = 0.5\nPlugging these numbers into our equation gives us the following:\n!!\n! !!!\n\ud835\udc43 = (1/2 ) 1/2 =\n!! !!! !\n!\"#\" ! !\n\ud835\udc43 = = 0.2734 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f 27.34%\n!\"\" !\" !\nBinomial expansion problem: The disease cystic fibrosis is a recessive disease governed\nby a single gene. Only individuals homozygous recessive are affected, whereas\nheterozygous individuals are unaffected carriers. The disease causes difficulty breathing\ndue to the buildup of mucous in the lungs. Suppose two heterozygous parents have five\noffspring. What is the probability that two of the five offspring will by affected with the\ndisease?\nTo solve this problem if will be helpful to first create a Punnett Square depicting the\npossible genotypes of the offspring. Remember Mendel\u2019s Law of Segregation when\nconstructing the Square and that both parents are heterozygous carriers of the cystic\nfibrosis allele.\nPunnett Square\nProf. Christopher Blair 11\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu What would be the probability that the couple\u2019s first child is affected and the next four\nchildren are unaffected? Would you use the product rule or the binomial expansion\nformula to determine this?\nPart 2: Measurements and dilutions\nTo adequately work in a genetics lab it is imperative to be comfortable with units of\nmeasurement and to be able to convert among units. Most of the time geneticists are working\nwith liquids, so common units of measurement include milliliters (m) and microliters (\u00b5). Below is\na table illustrating the different notations.\nNotation Factor Name Symbol\n10-1 0.1 deci d\n10-2 0.01 centi c\n10-3 0.001 milli m\n10-6 0.000001 micro \u00b5\n10-9 0.000000001 nano n\n10-12 0.000000000001 pico p\n101 10 deka da\n102 100 hecto h\n103 1000 kilo k\n106 1000000 mega M\n109 1000000000 giga G\n1012 1000000000000 tera T\nUsing the table above, make the following unit conversions. Determine this by moving the\ndecimal point the appropriate number of places.\n1. 25 \u00b5L = __________ mL 8. 8500 \u00b5L = __________ L\n2. 3 L = ____________ \u00b5L 9. 64 TL = ____________ GL\n3. 150 cL = __________ dL 10. 120000 nL = ________ \u00b5L\n4. 5000 pL = _________ nL\n5. 75 L = ____________ kL\n6. 800 nL = __________ cL\n7. 6 hL = _____________ ML\nProf. Christopher Blair 12\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu In addition to being able to convert among different units of measurement, geneticists also need\nto make what is called a working stock solution. A working stock solution is a reagent or other\nsolution that is directly used in reactions such as PCR, which we will study later on in the\ncourse. Most often, working stock solutions are made by diluting an original stock solution\nthat is at a concentration higher than what is needed for the experiment. By concentration we\nmean the amount of solutes in a given volume. The concentration of solutes in a solution is\nusually measured by molarity (M), which is the number of moles per liter of solution (moles/L).\nFor example, 1 M = 1 mole/L. To determine how many grams of a substance is equal to one\nmole the molecular mass is needed (we will not explore this in this lab). The general formula for\nmaking a dilution solution is the following:\n\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc49\n! ! ! !\nwhere\nC = the original concentration of stock solution\n1\nV = the volume of stock solution needed to make working solution\n1\nC = the desired concentration of working solution\n2\nV = the desired final volume of working solution\n2\nHow would you make a 100 \u00b5L working stock at a concentration of 0.5 \u00b5M from a stock\nsolution at a concentration of 0.1 mM? Always remember to put everything into the same\nunits first!\nWhat would be the working stock concentration (in molarity) if you diluted 250 \u00b5L of a\nstock concentration of 10 \u00b5M in a total volume of 1 mL?\nProf. Christopher Blair 13\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Dr. Christopher Blair\nGenetics\nBIO2450L\nLab 2\nCytogenetics and Karyotyping\nOverview and objectives\nThis week we will be learning how cytogeneticists use karyotyping to understand chromosomal\nabnormalities. Karyotyping is a technique where chromosomes are stained and visualized\nduring the metaphase stage of cell division (mitosis or meiosis). In this lab, you will take on the\nrole of a medical cytogeneticist and use human karyotypes to diagnose various diseases and\nabnormalities in patients. Upon completion of the lab, you should be familiar with what\nchromosomes are, what a karyotype is and how it is constructed, the different ways in which\nchromosomal abnormalities might arise, and the basic terminology used to describe\nchromosomes.\nBackground information\nOverview\nDNA is packed into units called chromosomes. In many species, DNA is closely associated\nwith several types of proteins called histones that are used to tightly pack the DNA into the cell\nnucleus (in eukaryotes). In eukaryotes, we say that the chromosomes are linear, whereas most\nbacteria contain a single circular chromosome. All eukaryotes also contain a second genome\ninside their cells called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Genes in mtDNA help regulate the process\nof cellular respiration. In addition, plants and several protists contain a third genome in their\nchloroplasts called chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), which is involved with photosynthesis. In this lab\nwe will focus exclusively on eukaryotic nuclear chromosomes. Human somatic cells contain\n46 chromosomes. As humans are a diploid species, half of the complement of chromosomes\n(23) originated from a sperm cell and half (23) originated from the egg cell. These are called\nhomologous chromosomes. For example, each person has two copies of Chromosome 1,\none copy inherited from the father and one copy inherited from the mother. Portions of\nhomologous chromosomes can exchange segments during meiosis in a process called\nrecombination. During cell division, each homolog is also duplicated, forming sister chromatids\n(Fig. 1). The region where sister chromatids attach during cell division is called the centromere.\nTelomeres are regions at the tips of chromosomes that consist of highly repetitive sequences\nthat form a protective cap to the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres tend to shorten with each\ncell division, leading to cell aging and eventually cell death. Much research has focused on\ntechniques decrease the propensity of telomere shorting to counteract the aging process.\nTherapeutic-related work has also focused on the role of telomeres in the proliferation of cancer\ncells.\nProf. Christopher Blair 14\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Human sex is determined genetically through the XY system\u2014human females are XX\nand human males are XY. Research has shown that\nhuman \u201cmaleness\u201d is determined by a gene that sits on\nthe Y chromosome. In several other species, sex is not\ndetermined by genes and chromosomes, but by\nenvironmental temperature though what is called\ntemperature-dependent sex determination. For example,\nin many crocodilian species, males are only produced if\neggs are incubated at intermediate temperatures. In\ncontract, females are produced if eggs are incubated at\neither extreme.\nA A a a\nThere is a large variation in the number of chromosomes\namong species, but there tends to be a correlation\nbetween organismal complexity and genome size. The\nhuman genome is approximately 3 Gbp, or 3 billion base\npairs long. This is considered a relatively large genome\n(some salamander genomes are much larger), but\nsurprisingly only about 2% of the genome encodes a\nfunctional product (e.g. proteins). Many researchers refer\nto the remaining 98% as \u2018junk DNA\u2019, although it is likely\nthat other regions of the genome are involved in\nregulating gene expression to some degree. For such a\nlarge genome to fit inside the cell nucleus, it needs to be\ncondensed substantially. The DNA is first wrapped\naround histone proteins, which then associate to form\nFig. 1.

First, they are number from largest\nto smallest. For example, human chromosome 1 would be the largest chromosome, which\ncontains 2,100 protein-coding genes and 249 million bp. The sex chromosomes are labeled\nappropriately as either XX in females or XY in males. Note that the X-chromosome is much\nlarger than the Y-chromosome. Therefore, the X- and Y- chromosomes are considered non-\nhomologous (although there are a few homologous regions that are needed for proper pairing\nduring cell division).\nThe relative position of the centromere can also differ between chromosomes. Centromeres that\nare placed in the center of a chromosome are called metacentric chromosomes, resulting in\nequal length chromosomal arms. When the centromere is not found in a central position,\ndifferent chromosomal arm lengths result. These arms are referred to as p arms (short arms)\nand q arms (long arms). In addition to metacentric chromosomes, chromosomes can be\nsubmetacentric, acrocentric, and telocentric, all varying in the relative position of the\ncentromere (Fig. 2).\nProf. Christopher Blair 15\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu A final way that cytogeneticists\ncan differentiate and classify\nchromosomes is to stain them\nwith dyes that produce diagnostic\nbanding patterns. Note that\nbands on a stained chromosome\nare not indicative of genes. In\ngeneral, there can be dozens or\nhundreds of genes within a\nsingle band. A common stain\nused by cytogeneticists is called\nthe Giemsa stain, also known as\nthe G-banding technique.\nFollowing the staining procedure,\nAT-rich regions of the\nchromosome appear dark\nwhereas transcriptionally active\nFig. 2.

Obtain cells (e.g. white blood cells, skin cells, cancer cells, cells from amniotic fluid).\nObtaining cells from amniotic fluid (amniocentesis) can be used to detect genetic\nabnormalities in the fetus.\n2. Treat cells with chemical to promote cell division.\n3. Treat cells with a second chemical that halts cell division at metaphase. This is the\nstage when chromosomes are highly condensed and easily visualized.\n4. Immerse cells in a hypotonic solution and place on glass slide.\n5. Stain chromosomes with Giemsa stain and observe under microscope.\n6. Prepare digital images and analyze results.\nGenetic abnormalities observed by G-banded karyotyping\nIn general, chromosome abnormalities can include both numerical changes and structural\nchanges. Numerical changes can involve an irregular number of a particular chromosome\n(aneuploidy). For example, a diploid individual possessing three copies of a chromosome\ninstead of the usual two copies would be called trisomy, whereas an individual with one copy\nwould be called monosomy. Trisomy 21 would mean three copies of chromosome 21 and is\ncharacteristic of individuals with Down syndrome (Fig. 3).\nProf. Christopher Blair 16\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fig. 3. Karyotype of a human male with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Note the three\ncopies of Chromosome 21. Homologous chromosomes were determined by size and\nbanding pattern. Image credit: US Department of Energy Human Genome Program.\nIn addition to abnormalities in the number of specific chromosomes, an individual can have an\nincorrect number of the complete set of chromosomes. A gain in one or more complete sets of\nchromosomes is termed euploidy, whereas a loss of an entire set of chromosomes is called\nmonoploidy. Monoploidy is usually fatal due to recessive mutations (many of which are lethal)\nbeing phenotypically expressed.\nIn addition to numerical changes, chromosomes can also exhibit the following structural\nchanges involving either one or two chromosomes (Fig. 4):\na. Translocations (two chromosomal change) \u2013 two non-homologous chromosomes\nfuse or swap segments.\nb. Insertions (two chromosomal change) \u2013 one region of one chromosome removed\nand inserted into a different chromosome.\nc. Inversions (single chromosomal change) \u2013 certain regions of a chromosome are\nplaced in an incorrect orientation with respect to the remainder of the chromosome.\nd. Duplications (single chromosomal change) \u2013 one segment of a chromosome is\nduplicated.\nProf. Christopher Blair 17\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu e. Deletions (single chromosomal change) \u2013 removal or loss of a particular region or\nsegment of a chromosome. Commonly occurs in telomeric regions during cell\ndivision.\nFig. 4. Alternative mechanisms that can contribute to\nstructural chromosomal abnormalities. Note that\ninsertions and translocations involve more than one\nchromosome. Image credit: YassineMrabet (author)\nAlthough standard karyotyping can provide a powerful approach to diagnosing various genetic\ndiseases, it is considered a wide resolution technique, meaning that it is unable to detect\ngenetic abnormalities below a certain number of base pairs (~1 million). In these cases, other\ntechniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), array comparative genome\nhybridization (CGH), and direct DNA sequencing can be used, the latter of which can be used to\ndetect single nucleotide changes or polymorphisms (SNPs).\nProf. Christopher Blair 18\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Activity\nWorking in pairs, you will assume the role of a medical cytogeneticist and aid in the diagnosis of\nvarious genetic diseases. Each group should try to get through as many case studies as\npossible.\n1. Each group should receive several blank copies of the Cytogenetics Report to be\nfilled out for each case study.\n2. Each Chromoscan Board contains a single case study, is color-coded and is\nassociated with the colored chromosome decals. For example, Case Study A is\npinkish purple. Never mix and match Chromoscan Boards and decals.\n3. Randomly select one of the chromosome decals and make a sketch of the\nchromosome on the Cytogenetics Report. Be sure to label the centromere,\ntelomere, p arm, and q arm. Also make note if the chromosome is metacentric,\nsubmetacentric, acrocentric, or telocentric.\n4. Record all the relevant information from the case study on the report.\n5. To create the karyotype you will match the correctly colored chromosome decals with\nthe chromosomes already present on the Chromoscan Board. In other words, your\ngoal is to correctly pair homologous chromosomes.\n6. Once the karyotype is created, analyze it for any chromosomal abnormalities (e.g.\ninversions, translocations, deletions, insertions, duplications).\n7. Report your findings on the Cytogenetics Report.\n8. To diagnose the patient, refer to the table below and write the diagnosis on the\nCytogenetics Report.\n9.

This experiment provides a simple, yet effective hands-on introduction to basic properties\nof meiosis. Our technicians have already prepared cultures of three types of Sordaria fimicola\n(wild-type, mutant tan, and mutant gray). In the lab you should see six dishes, two containing\nthe wild-type strain, two with the tan strain, and two with the gray strain. Your job is to set-up\ncrosses of these different strains to determine the proportion of asci containing \u201chybrid\u201d\nascospores that are a result of crossing over during prophase I of meiosis. You will have\nmultiple dishes containing agar that will be used to perform your experiment.\n1. Use alcohol to disinfect all work surfaces and wash your hands.\n2. Obtain a petri dish containing the Sordaria crossing agar to make your crosses.\nRemember that we are making crosses between wild-type and gray and wild-type and\ntan strains. For simplicity, I recommend using separate plates for the tan and gray\nmutants. For example, one dish will be a wild-type vs. tan cross and another dish will\ncontain wild-type vs. gray cross.\n3. Using a marking pencil, invert your dish and draw four equal quadrants. Label two of the\nquadrants as wild-type and two as mutant (either gray or tan). Refer to Fig. 5 for an\nexample. Also, make sure to write your names and the date on your dishes.\nCross Plate I Cross Plate II\nWT T WT G\nT\nWT G WT\nFig. 5. Creation of Sordaria crosses.

Using a sterilized wooden splint, cut small 0.5 cm cubes from the stock culture dishes.\nIt is important to use sterilized equipment to minimize contamination. The common\nprocedure for sterilization is to dip a utensil (e.g. scalpel) into alcohol and then flame it\nover a Bunsen burner. In our case, the wooden splits are already sterilized. Carefully\ninvert the cubes (hyphae side down) and place them in the correct location on the cross\nplates (see diagram above). For example, you will cut out a 0.5 cm cube from the tan\nstrain and place it in one of the quadrants labeled \u201ctan\u201d on your cross plate. Each culture\nplate should contain four cubes (two wild-type and two mutant [either tan or gray, but not\nboth]). Using the side of your splint, gently press the cubes onto the agar so they stick.\nNext, apply some parafilm and seal the outside of your dishes.\n5. Incubate the dishes at room temperature for 1 week.\nProf. Christopher Blair 23\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Dr. Christopher Blair\nGenetics\nBIO2450L\nLab 3\nMeiosis and Genetic Recombination\nBackground:\nOverview of Meiosis: In this lab we will examine cell division by meiosis. Meiosis, unlike\nmitosis, results in a change in ploidy among daughter cells. In diploid species such as humans,\nmeiosis results in in four (4) daughter cells that originate from a single diploid germ cell. In\nhumans, all somatic (non sex cells) are diploid (2n) and contain two sets of chromosomes (2n =\n46). Haploid cells (n = 23) are found only in gametes (sperm and egg). During the process of\nfertilization, the haploid genome of the sperm fuses with the haploid genome of the egg to return\nto the diploid state in the resulting zygote.\nAlso, unlike mitosis, meiosis is divided into two separate divisions termed meiosis I and\nmeiosis II. Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I, whereas sister chromatids\nseparate in meiosis II. Figure 1 illustrates both stages of meiosis using an example with 2n = 6.\nUnlike interphase, chromosomes are highly condensed during meiosis, which makes them\nclearly visible using standard light microscopy. Looking at metaphase I we can see that\nhomologous chromosomes pair up at the metaphasic plate. For example, the copy of\nchromosome 8 inherited from the father aligns with the copy of chromosome 8 inherited from\nthe mother. This contrasts with metaphase in mitosis, where homologous chromosomes simply\nline up in a single line one chromosome wide. The pairing and random organization of\nhomologous chromosomes along the metaphasic plate during meiosis I is one mechanisms that\nleads to daughter cells being genetically different from the parent cell. We can call meiosis the\n\u2018reductional phase\u2019 because it produces two haploid cells from a single diploid cell. Meiosis II is\nsimilar to mitosis in the separation of sister chromatids. Also, as in mitosis, during meiosis II\nchromosomes align into a single column during metaphase II. Take some time to make sure\nyou understand Fig. 1 and the stages of meiosis, as it will be important for the lab\nactivity.\nIf you look closely at Fig. 1, you will notice that some chromosomes contain both blue and red\nsegments. This is due to a process called \u2018crossing over\u2019 or recombination and occurs during\nprophase I. During crossing over, homologous portions of two chromosomes swap information,\nleading to chromosomes that contain a mix of alleles from both maternal and paternal\nchromosomes. For many species, crossing over is facilitated by the formation of a\nsynaptonemal complex, which helps bind the arms of homologous chromosomes. By\nexamining the rate of recombination among alleles, researchers can construct a linkage map\nthat shows the position of genes relative to one another along a chromosome. This is because\nthe probability of recombination is proportional to the distance separating two genes along a\nchromosome. In other words, alleles at two genes that are physically close together on a\nchromosome are more likely to be inherited together versus alleles separated by a large\ndistance. Let\u2019s take a look at another example in Fig. 2.\nProf. Christopher Blair 24\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fig. 1. Overview of meiosis in a cell with 6 chromosomes (2n = 6). For simplicity,\npaternal chromosomes are in blue and maternal chromosomes are in red. Note that\nupon completion of meiosis II, four haploid cells are produced. The yellow circles at\nthe poles are centrosomes, which anchor the mitotic spindle where chromosomes\nattach via their centromere. Proteins called the kinetochore help attach centrosomes\nto spindle.

Image credit: CC BY-SA\n3.0 Emw (author). 3.0 Emw (author).\nHere, we are working with four genes we will call Gene A, Gene B, Gene C, Gene D. This\nparticular individual is homozygous for Gene A, heterozygous for Gene B, heterozygous for\nGene C, and heterozygous for Gene D. The maternal chromosome originally contained the\nalleles A, B, C, and D, whereas the paternal chromosome contained alleles A, b, c, and d.\nFollowing recombination, the d allele becomes associated with the A, B, and C alleles on one\nmaternal chromatid. Further, the D allele becomes associated with the A, b, and c alleles on one\nof the paternal chromatids. Thus, there is a new \u2018combination\u2019 of alleles that will be transmitted\nto daughter cells and eventually to sperm or egg.\nProf. Christopher Blair 26\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu In Fig. 3 we can add another gene, Gene E that is in close proximity to Gene D. Because these\ntwo genes are so close to one another, the likelihood that recombination will occur between\nthem is minimal. Thus, alleles present at both genes will tend to be linked, or always inherited\ntogether. For example, the D and E alleles will be inherited and the d and e alleles will be\ninherited (never D and e or e and D). Because these alleles tend to be present in particular\ncombinations in offspring, we can deduce that the genes must be in close proximity on the\nchromosome.\nBiology of Sordaria fimicola: In this lab we will be working with cultures of the fungus Sordaria\nfimicola. This is a species of fungus that is commonly used in genetics labs to illustrate\nproperties of meiosis and recombination. The fungus is commonly found in the dung of\nherbivorous animals. Sordaria belong to a phylum of fungi called Ascomycota (sac fungi).\nReproduction occurs sexually via the production of haploid spores called ascospores. These\nascospores are contained in a structure inside the fungus called an ascus. All of these\nstructures are contained in a perithecium. Each ascus contains eight ascospores that get\nreleased into the environment. Wild-type spores are a dark color, whereas mutant varieties are\ntan or gray. The full life cycle of a typical ascomycete fungus is shown in Fig. 4.\nFig. 4. Sexual and asexual\nreproductive cycles of a typical\nascomycete fungus. Colored dots\ninside cells represent nuclei. Note\nthat most cells of the fungus exist\nin a haploid or a dikaryotic stage.\nImage credit: CC BY-SA 4.0\nZeeshan 93 (author).\nFocusing our attention on the sexual life cycle, we start with the fusion of hyphae from different\nmycelia. Following mitosis, this results in the production of a fruiting body called an ascocarp.\nInside the ascocarp are many dikaryotic cells containing unfused nuclei. Upon fusion of nuclei\nProf. Christopher Blair 27\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu (karyogamy) in the ascus, a diploid zygote is produced. This zygote undergoes meiosis to\nproduce four haploid nuclei that subsequently undergo mitosis to produce eight haploid\nascospores. These spores get released into the environment and germinate into a new haploid\nmycelium.\nIf no recombination (crossing over) has occurred for genes controlling ascospore color, we\nanticipate an ordered 4:4 ratio of wild-type to mutant spore color following a cross between\nstrains (Fig. 5). Conversely, if crossing over did occur, we would expect deviations from the 4:4\nratio (e.g. 2:2:2:2 or 2:4:2).\nNo crossing Crossing\nover over\nMeiosis I\nMeiosis II\nAscus\nMitosis\n8 ascospores\nFig. 5. Graphical depiction of the formation of ascospores in Sordaria fimicola following a\ncross between a wild-type black and a mutant tan strain. The left path depicts a situation\nwhere no recombination occurs among genes controlling ascospore color, producing the\ntypical 4:4 ratio of black to tan. Conversely, the path on the right shows a case of\nrecombination. In this case, recombination produces ascospores in a ratio of 2 black:2 tan:2\nblack:2 tan. The gray color on the black chromosomes represent the location of genes\ngoverning black spores, whereas the dark brown color on tan chromosomes indicate the\nlocation of genes controlling tan spore color. Red box highlights crossing over event.\nThe goal of this laboratory is to use cultured Sordaria to better understand meiosis and genetic\nrecombination, and how meiosis can lead to offspring that differ genetically from parents.\nProf. Christopher Blair 28\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Week 2 \u2013 Preparation of crosses (this is what was completed the previous week):\nOur technicians have already prepared cultures of three types of Sordaria (wild-type, mutant\ntan, and mutant gray). In the lab you should see six dishes, two containing the wild-type strain,\ntwo with the tan strain, and two with the gray strain. Your job is to set-up crosses of these\ndifferent strains to determine the proportion of asci containing \u201chybrid\u201d ascospores that are a\nresult of crossing over during prophase I of meiosis. You will have multiple dishes containing\nagar that will be used to perform your experiment.\n1. Use alcohol to disinfect all work surfaces and wash your hands.\n2. Obtain a petri dish containing the Sordaria crossing agar to make your crosses.\nRemember that we are making crosses between wild-type and gray and wild-type and\ntan strains. For simplicity, I recommend using separate plates for the tan and gray\nmutants. For example, one dish will be a wild-type vs. tan cross and another dish will\ncontain wild-type vs. gray cross.\n3. Using a marking pencil, invert your dish and draw four equal quadrants. Label two of the\nquadrants as wild-type and two as mutant (either gray or tan). Refer to Fig. 6 for an\nexample. Also, make sure to write your names and the date on your dishes.\nCross Plate I Cross Plate II\nWT T WT G\nT\nWT G WT\nFig. 6. Creation of Sordaria crosses.

Using a sterilized wooden splint, cut small 0.5 cm cubes from the stock culture dishes.\nIt is important to sterilize all equipment to minimize contamination. The common\nprocedure for sterilization is to dip a utensil (e.g. scalpel) into alcohol and then flame it\nover a Bunsen burner. In our case, the wooden splits are already sterilized. Carefully\ninvert the cubes (hyphae side down) and place them in the correct location on the cross\nplates. For example, you will cut out a 0.5 cm cube from the tan strain and place it in one\nof the quadrants labeled \u201ctan\u201d on your cross plate. Each culture plate should contain four\ncubes (two wild-type and two mutant [either tan or gray, but not both]). Using the side of\nyour splint, gently press the cubes onto the agar so they stick. Next, apply some parafilm\nand seal the outside of your dishes.\n5. Incubate the dishes at room temperature for 1 week.\nWeek 3 \u2013 Microscopic examination of crosses:\nThis week we will examine the results of the genetic crosses we made between wild-type and\nmutant Sordaria strains during the previous week. Your goal is to determine if asci show signs\nof genetic recombination, based on the expected distribution of spore color. Remember, we\nexpect a 4:4 wild-type to mutant distribution in asci that did not undergo crossing over.\nFollow the instructions below to visualize the asci.\n1. Use alcohol to disinfect all work surfaces and wash your hands.\n2. Working in groups of two, obtain a compound light microscope, glass slides, cover\nslips, water dropping bottles, and sterilized toothpicks.\n3. Using a sterilized tooth pick, remove a few perithecia from the cross plate and create\na wet mount. You can find the perithecia near the junction of the different\nstrains. To create a wet mount, gently rub the tip of the toothpick on a glass slide to\nremove the perithecia. Next, place a drop of water on your specimen.\n4. Using a cover slip, gently press down on the perithecia until they rupture and release\nthe asci. Note that putting too much pressure will force the ascospores out of the\nascus, making it impossible to draw any conclusions from the experiment.\n5. Observe the asci and ascospores under low magnification. Remember that wild-type\nspores should be a dark color, whereas the two mutant strains will be tan or gray.\nNext, try switching to high power magnification to view the ascospores more closely.\nRemember, crossing over has occurred in asci demonstrating either a 2:2:2:2 or\n2:4:2 color pattern. Refer back to Fig. 5 to review how and when crossing over takes\nplace.\n6. Each group should count 200 asci, keeping track of how many show evidence for\nrecombination and how many do not.\n7. We can actually use the frequency of crossing over to estimate the relative position\nof the genes on the chromosome with respect to the centromere. This is because\nProf. Christopher Blair 30\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu there is a direct relationship between recombination rate and distance between two\npoints (genes) along a chromosome. Fill out the table below with your data.\nStrains # Non- # Total asci % Map Units (%\nCrossed recombinant Recombinant Recombinant Recombinant/2)\nasci asci\nWild-type x\ngray\nWild-type x\ntan\nReview questions:\n1. Compare and contrast mitosis from meiosis. In your answer, make sure you address\nwhy mitosis generally results in two genetically identical daughter cells, whereas\nmeiosis leads to genetic variation. Feel free to use drawings in your answer.\n2. Meiosis is involved in the process of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction can\nlead to offspring that differ genetically from parents. What are the benefits of sexual\nreproduction and increased genetic diversity? What are the potential costs of sexual\nreproduction? Can you think of a real-world example that might favor asexual\nreproduction?\nProf. Christopher Blair 31\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 3. In your own words, describe the typical sexual life cycle of Sordaria. Make note of\nwhich stages are haploid, diploid, and dikaryotic. Are ascospores produced by\nmeiosis or mitosis? Explain your reasoning.\n4. Based on what you know of mitosis and meiosis, complete the following sentence:\nCrossing over occurs during the _____________ stage of ____________.\n5. Discuss the relationship between recombination rate and the position of genes along\na chromosome. Would a high recombination rate indicate that two genes are close\ntogether or far apart along a chromosome? Explain your answer.\nProf. Christopher Blair 32\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Dr. Christopher Blair\nGenetics\nBIO2450L\nLab 4 \u2013 Lab 7\nPatterns of Inheritance: Fruit Flies, Blood Types, Population Genetics and Hardy-\nWeinberg\nLab Overview\nOver the next four weeks we will be working with two different exercises and simulations to\nfurther examine patterns of inheritance. In the first series of labs you will perform monohybrid\nand dihybrid crosses using real fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to examine inheritance\npatterns. The labs are spread out over a course of four weeks due to the time it takes to cross\nand rear flies. The second set of labs deals with inheritance patterns of human blood types.\nDuring the \u201cdown time\u201d of the fly lab, you are expected to work on the blood typing activity and\nbecome familiar with the genetics behind different blood types. You are also expected to\nbecome familiar with the Hardy-Weinberg principle, and how it can be used as a null model to\ndetermine if evolution has occurred in a population. Finally, you will perform computer\nsimulations of population genetic processes during Week 6.\nLab Breakdown:\nWeek 4 \u2013 Examination of wild-type and mutant Drosophila phenotypes and sex\nidentification. Begin blood typing exercise.\nWeek 5 \u2013 F phenotyping, setting up F crosses. Continue working on blood typing\n1 1\nexercise.\nWeek 6 \u2013 Remove all adult F flies from cross vials. Perform population genetic\n1\nsimulations.\nWeek 7 \u2013 Score phenotypes of all F flies. Data analysis and review.\n2\nDrosophila Genetics\nThe fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a \u2018model organism\u2019 that has been used for genetics\nresearch for many years. These flies have a relatively short generation time, are easy to cross,\nproduce a large number of offspring, have relatively small genomes, and are harmless to\nhumans, making them an ideal study system to understand patterns of inheritance in a\ncontrolled laboratory setting. We will be studying inheritance patterns of both wild-type and\nmutant phenotypes of flies over the course of several weeks. In Week 5 you will cross F flies\n1\nexhibiting different phenotypic characteristics. Crosses may be either monohybrid or\ndihybrid. You goal will be to determine which traits are dominant, recessive, autosomal,\nand sex-linked. To help guide you through the activities it will be useful to think back to what\nyou learned about Mendelian inheritance and Punnett squares.\nProf. Christopher Blair 33\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fly Lab Week 4 \u2013 Sexing Fruit Flies and Quantifying Phenotypes\nFor the first portion of the fruit fly exercise your goal is to become familiar with determining the\nsex of flies. Although this can be difficult at times, there are a few key criteria that can be used\nto help make the determination. Male flies generally have a darker posterior region versus\nfemales, whereas the female abdomen tends to show several distinct stripes (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1. A comparison of male and female\nfruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Males\ntend to show a dark, blunt posterior\nwhereas females demonstrate light,\npointed posteriors. Image credit: CC BY-\nSA 4.0 YassineMrabet (author).\nIn addition to determining the sex of your flies (with a stereomicroscope or magnifying glass),\nyou are expected to become familiar with the different phenotypes present in mutant and wild-\ntype varieties. Pay particular attention to eye color and wing shape. Your instructor will\nprovide anesthetized flies and petri dishes for your analysis. Fill in the table below with your\nobservations and make sketches of the phenotypes and the sexes. When finished, transfer\nyour flies to the vial of alcohol.\nTable 1. Phenotypes of wild-type and mutant parental strains.\nPhenotype Phenotype\nWild Type: Mutant A:\nWild Type: Mutant B:\nWild Type: Mutant C:\nSpace for sketches:\nProf. Christopher Blair 34\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fly Lab Week 5 \u2013 Quantification of F Phenotypes and Setting Crosses\n1\nThis week you will be scoring F phenotypes and setting up F crosses to produce the F\n1 1 2\ngeneration. F flies were already produced for you by crossing two pure strains together (from\n1\nTable 1 above). Before you make your crosses, fill out the table below with your observations\nfor F flies from particular parental strains (P generation).\n1\n____________________ X _____________________\nFemale Parent (P gen) Male Parent (P gen)\nTable 2. Sex-specific phenotypes of F flies.\n1\nDate Phenotype # Females With # Males With Total Number of\nPhenotype Phenotype Flies\nThe next step is to setup your F crosses. As a class, we need to make sure that all crosses are\n1\nmade in replicate to obtain a decent sample size.\n1. To setup your culture vials, add one cup of the Instant Drosophila Medium and one cup\nof water to the vial. When the solution solidifies, add 4-7 grains of yeast to the culture\nmedia.\n2. Add six (6) male/female pairs of anesthetized flies into your culture vial. Be sure to label\nthe vial with \u2018F cross\u2019, the parental strains crossed, the date, and your names.\n1\n3. After all the F flies are scored, the data are recorded, and the crosses set, dispose of\n1\nany remaining anesthetized F flies into the vial with alcohol.\n1\n4. Based on the data in Tables 1 and 2, come up with a hypothesis for how your\ntrait(s) are inherited. For example, how many genes are involved? Which alleles\nare likely dominant and recessive? Are any traits sex-linked?\n5. Create two Punnett squares showing the results of both your P and F crosses.\n1\nYou may use any letters you like for alleles. Results will vary depending on which\nstrains your group selected for crosses.\n6. What are the predicted phenotypic ratios of your F generation?\n2\nProf. Christopher Blair 35\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fly Lab Week 6 \u2013 Removing F Flies from Crossing Vials\n1\nThe fly activities this week are relatively short. Thus, this is a good time to focus on the\npopulation genetics simulation lab and the associated questions and the end of the manual. At\nthis point in the experiment you will need to remove the F flies from your crossing vials. This is\n1\nnecessary to prevent mating between F and F flies, which will bias the results. Also, by Week\n1 2\n6 you should begin to see F fly larvae emerging in your vials. Place your culture vial under a\n2\ndissecting microscope to get a better look at the morphological features of your larvae. If\npossible, make some sketches of your larvae using the space below. Make sure your\nflies don\u2019t escape!\n1. Obtain an empty culture vial and plug.\n2. Tap your F cross vial on your bench to knock the adult flies to the bottom. Remove\n1\nplug and place mouth of empty vial on mouth of cross vial. Invert vials to transfer\nadult flies into the new vial. Quickly replace plug in both vials.\n3. Anesthetize adult flies by dipping wand into Fly Nap anesthetic and inserting wand\nbeside the plug.\n4. When adequately anesthetized, place flies in alcohol vial.\nSketches of Larvae\nProf. Christopher Blair 36\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fly Lab Week 7 \u2013 Quantification of F Phenotypes and Data Analysis\n2\nYour goal this week is to score the phenotypes of the F flies that originated from your F\n2 1\ncrosses. Determine both the sex of each fly and the relevant phenotype(s). Anesthetize the\nadults and transfer them to a petri dish for scoring. Use the dissecting microscope or magnifying\nglass to aid in data collection. Try to score as many flies as possible and fill out the table below.\nTable 3.

Do the observed ratios correspond to the ratios you predicted? Discuss your\nreasoning.\n3. Using the total observed class data for each cross, conduct chi-square analyses\nto determine if there is a statistically significant difference between observed and\nexpected phenotypes. Remember, in a monohybrid cross we expect a 3:1\nphenotypic ratio in the F generation, whereas in a dihybrid cross we expect a\n2\n9:3:3:1 ratio. Recall the chi-square formula:\n(\ud835\udc42\u2212\ud835\udc38)! (\ud835\udc42 \u2212 \ud835\udc38 )! (\ud835\udc42 \u2212 \ud835\udc38 )! (\ud835\udc42 \u2212 \ud835\udc38 )!\n\u03c7! = = ! ! + ! ! + ! !\n\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc38\n! ! !\nThe degrees of freedom (df) = # different F phenotypes \u2013 1. Thus, df = 1 for a\n2\nmonohybrid cross and df = 3 for a dihybrid cross. Use the chi-square table to\ndetermine if your calculated chi-square values are statistically significant.\nAs an example, suppose you performed a monohybrid cross of wild-type and\nsepia-eyed flies and scored 100 F flies. Out of the 100 flies, 65 had the wild-type\n2\nphenotype and 35 had the mutant (sepia) phenotype. Are the results significantly\ndifferent from expectations (i.e. 3:1 ratio)?\n(\ud835\udc42\u2212\ud835\udc38)! (65\u2212 75)! (35\u2212 25)!\n\u03c7! = = + = 1.33+4 = 5.33\n\ud835\udc38 75 25\nProf. Christopher Blair 39\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu With 1 df and P = 0.05, a chi-square value of 5.33 is significantly higher than that\nexpected by chance. Thus, we can conclude that the observed results are significantly\ndifferent from expectations (i.e. we reject the null hypothesis of no statistically\nsignificant difference between observed and expected values).\nGo ahead and perform your own series of calculations for each of the three crosses\nexamined in class. Are any results consistent with expectations? Explain.\nProf. Christopher Blair 40\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Human Blood Types\nHuman blood can be of four primary types: Type A, Type B, Type AB, and Type O. These\ntypes are determined based on a specific antigen present on an individual\u2019s red blood cells. For\nexample, someone with Type A blood possesses Type A antigen on red blood cells whereas\nsomeone with Type B blood has Type B antigen on his/her red blood cells (Fig. 1). Individuals\nwith Type AB blood show a phenotype expressing both Type A and Type B antigens. Finally,\nsomeone with Type O blood has neither Type A or Type B antigens on red blood cells. In\naddition, individuals with certain blood types will possess antibodies in their blood that will react\nwith different blood types. This is why doctors make sure that they know your specific blood type\nbefore a transfusion is given! For example, a normal individual with Type A blood will possess\nantibodies against Type B blood. If this individual was given a transfusion of Type B blood, the\nanti-B antibodies in the patient\u2019s blood will bind the Type B antigen on the transfused blood,\nleading to agglutination, or the clumping of red blood cells. This can lead to reduced efficiency\nof oxygen transport in the body and death. Since individuals with AB blood have both Type A\nand Type B antigens, no antibodies to either are present in the blood. This is why blood type AB\nis considered the \u2018universal recipient.\u2019 They can receive blood from pretty much anyone without\nfear of a negative reaction. Conversely, people with Type O blood possess antibodies against\nboth Type A and Type B. Thus, these individuals can only receive blood from others with Type\nO. However, since Type O blood cells do not contain any A or B antigen, any blood group can\nreceive Type O blood. This is why blood type O is considered the \u2018universal donor.\u2019 Figure 2\nprovides a summary of donor and recipient status for different blood types. In addition to the\nABO system, you will often see a + or \u2013 sign after the blood type. This designated whether the\nblood is positive or negative for a second antigen called a Rhesus or Rh-factor that is controlled\nby different genes.\nProf. Christopher Blair 41\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fig. 1.

The first\ndeviation is that three different alleles control the blood phenotype in the ABO system. These\nalleles are commonly designated IA, IB, and i. The A and B alleles are codominant, meaning\nthat both phenotypes are expressed in heterozygotes (Fig. 3). The i allele is recessive, meaning\nthat individuals with Type O blood must have two copies to demonstrate the O phenotype.\nFig. 3. Inheritance patterns within\nthe human ABO system. Not that\nthe A and B alleles are codominant\nand the O (or i) allele is recessive.\nImage credit: YassineMrabet\n(author).\nUsing the allelic nomenclature above, Table 1 shows all of the potential genotypes and\nphenotypes in this system.\nGenotype Phenotype\nIA IA A\nTable 1.

What are the resulting\nphenotypic ratios?\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle is a foundational null\nmodel in population genetics that is used to determine\nif evolution has occurred in a population. If all of the\nHardy-Weinberg assumptions are met, we can\nconclude that the population is not evolving. In reality,\npopulations are always evolving due to one or multiple\nmicroevolutionary forces that change allele frequencies\nfrom generation to generation. Remember, evolution\nis defined as changes in allele frequencies over\nmultiple generations. Microevolutionary forces\ninclude the following:\na. Mutation \u2013 the spontaneous creation of\na new allele in a population\nb. Gene flow \u2013 the transfer of alleles from\none population to another\nc. Natural selection \u2013 the influence of the\nenvironment on relative fitness of\nindividuals in a population. Some alleles\nin a population might be selected for,\nwhereas others will be selected against.\nd. Genetic drift \u2013 changes in allele\nfrequencies due to mating efficiency and\nrandomness associated with allelic\nsegregation during gametogenesis and\nmeiosis (Fig. 4).\ne. Nonrandom mating \u2013 sometimes\nconsidered a microevolutionary force\ndue to changes in genotype\nfrequencies.\nFig. 4.

Suppose we are studying a\ngene in a population that consists of two alleles, we will call A and a. I tell you that the A allele is\ndominant and the a allele is recessive. Using HW notation, we call the A allele p and the a\nallele q. You also know that the frequency of p is 0.73.\nWhat is the frequency of q?\np + q = 1\nq = 1 \u2013 p\nq = 1 \u2013 0.73 = 0.27\nNext, we can predict the genotype frequencies in the population under the HW assumption.\nBecause we are generally working with diploid individuals possessing two alleles per\ngene/locus, we can come up with a formula to estimate genotype frequencies from allele\nfrequencies.\n(p + q)(p + q) = p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1\nwhere p2 is the genotype frequency for the homozygote dominant genotype, 2pq is the\ngenotype frequency of heterozygotes, and q2 is the genotype frequency for the homozygote\nrecessive.\nUsing the allele frequencies of A and a above, calculate the genotype frequencies\nexpected under HW assumptions.\nAs stated above, the HW principle is used as a null model to determine if a population is\nevolving. In practice, researchers collect genotypic data from a population of interest and\ncompare the real genotypic frequencies from the expected frequencies under HW. Significant\ndeviations from HW assumptions suggest that one or more microevolutionary forces are\nchanging allele and genotype frequencies over generations.\nProf. Christopher Blair 45\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Let\u2019s try an example. Say you go out to a tropical island to study the population genetics of a\nspecies of lizard. For one of the genes you are examining you find only two alleles in the\npopulation, we will call T and t. You use molecular genetic tools to obtain the following\ngenotypes for 100 lizards:\nTT = 44\nTt = 36\ntt = 20\nAre these data consistent with HW expectations? Explain your reasoning and show your work.\nRaise your hand if you need assistance! Hint: calculate p first!\nAs with earlier problems, we can use a chi-square test to statistically test if the observed data\ndiffer from HW expectations. For HW tests with two alleles we use 1 degree of freedom\nbecause once we know p, q can be easily determined and vice versa. In the chi-square table\nthe critical value at P = 0.05 is 3.84. Thus, calculated chi-square values > 3.84 suggest that the\npopulation is deviating significantly from HW expectations.\n! ! ! !\n(!!!)

Your goal is to use synthetic blood samples to determine blood genotypes of an\nisland population of humans with unknown ancestry. Some island inhabitants suggest that they\nshare ancestry with populations on a neighboring island, whereas others suggest that the\nmajority of their genetic makeup comes from foreign populations. We will be performing multiple\nrounds of blood testing over the course of two weeks, keeping track of the total number of\ncounts for each blood type. The blood dishes can be reused, but make sure you rinse them well\nbefore testing different samples. The mixing sticks may be thrown away after use. However, be\nsure to use the correct color stick depending upon the treatment (blue, yellow, clear).\n1. Obtain a mixing tray and a blood sample from your instructor. Place a drop of blood\ninto each of the three wells in your dish. Be sure to replace cap on sample.\n2. Add drop of Anti A (blue vial) in well labeled \u2018A.\u2019\n3. Add drop of Anti B (yellow vial) in well labeled \u2018B.\u2019\n4. Add drop of Anti D (clear vial) in well labeled \u2018Rh.\u2019\n5. Use the appropriately colored mixing stick to mix the blood sample with the serum.\nMake sure not to contaminate your samples! Dispose of mixing sticks when\nfinished.\n6. Monitor wells to determine if agglutination occurs (this should hopefully be obvious).\nFill in the table below with a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 depending on whether or not agglutination\noccurred. A positive reaction will indicate the blood type (e.g. a \u2018yes\u2019 for Anti-A only\nwould signify an A- blood type). Each student will test two samples each week.\nWeek 4 Week 5\nSample # Sample #\nSample # Sample #\nAnti-A\nAnti-A\nAnti-B\nAnti-B\nAnti-Rh\nAnti-Rh\nBlood\nBlood\ntype\ntype\nProf. Christopher Blair 47\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 7.

The tables below shows the blood group frequencies of inhabitants of two different\nislands neighboring the islands that you have already scored above.

For the two additional island populations in Question 9, calculate the expected Rh\nfactor genotype frequencies under HW equilibrium. How do the results compare to\nthe two populations you blood typed? Explain your reasoning.\nProf. Christopher Blair 49\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 11. So far, we have only examined HW principles in genes consisting of two alleles. We\ncan extend the HW equations to more than two alleles, although the math can get\nconfusing quickly. However, it isn\u2019t much more difficult to calculate expected\nfrequencies with three alleles. Our blood type activity provides an excellent example\nas the ABO type is controlled by three alleles: IA, IB, and i.\nWith three alleles:\np + q + r = 1\nand thus,\n(p + q + r)(p + q + r) = p2 + 2pq + 2pr + q2 + 2qr + r2 = 1\nwhere\np2 = expected frequency of IAIA genotype\nq2 = expected frequency of IBIB genotype\nr2 = expected frequency of ii genotype\n2pq = expected frequency of IAIB heterozygotes\n2pr = expected frequency of IAi heterozygotes\n2qr = expected frequency of IBi heterozygotes\nSuppose you go out and obtain blood genotypes from 1000 people throughout NYC\nand obtain the following results:\nGenotype Count Genotype\nfrequency\nIAIA 210 0.21\nIBIB 75 0.075\nii 330 0.33\nIAIB 143 0.143\nIAi 86 0.086\nIBi 156 0.156\nPerform a chi-square analysis to determine if these results are consistent with HW\nexpectations. In this case, because we are dealing with three alleles we will need to\nuse 2 degrees of freedom. At P= 0.05 the critical chi-square value is 5.991.\nRemember, to solve HW problems you must first calculate allele frequencies (p, q\nand r in this case) and use the allele frequencies to calculate expected genotype\nfrequencies under HW.

Suppose the frequency of cystic fibrosis in a population is 3%.\nAssuming the gene is in HW equilibrium, calculate the allele and genotype\nfrequencies.

Are these data consistent with simple Mendelian expectations?\nExplain your reasoning and show all your work.\nProf. Christopher Blair 54\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Simulation of Population Genetic Processes (Week 6)\nBackground:\nOnce considered a strictly theoretical discipline, technological advances have now made it\nfeasible to assay genetic variation in natural populations. Quantification of population genetic\nstructure has importance within many biological disciplines including human genetics, medicine,\nevolution, ecology, and conservation. In general, the field of population genetics is focused on\ndetermining the processes responsible for shaping spatial patterns of allelic variation. Recall\nthat evolution, specifically microevolution, can be defined as changes in population allele\nfrequencies over multiple generations. Four primary mechanisms are responsible for controlling\nallele frequencies within populations: mutation, gene flow, natural selection, and genetic\ndrift. Non-random mating (including sexual selection) does not directly affect allele frequencies,\nbut can influence genotype frequencies within populations. Brief definitions of each\nmicroevolutionary process are provided below.\nf. Mutation \u2013 the spontaneous creation of a new allele in a population\ng. Gene flow \u2013 the transfer of alleles from one population to another\nh. Natural selection \u2013 the influence of the environment on relative fitness of\nindividuals in a population. Some alleles in a population might be selected for,\nwhereas others will be selected against.\ni. Genetic drift \u2013 changes in allele frequencies due to mating efficiency and\nrandomness associated with allelic segregation during gametogenesis and\nmeiosis.\nj. Nonrandom mating \u2013 sometimes considered a microevolutionary force due to\nchanges in genotype frequencies.\nIt is important to make the distinction between what are called neutral microevolutionary\nprocesses versus adaptive microevolutionary processes. Natural selection is considered an\nadaptive process because it alters allele frequencies by \u2018selecting\u2019 for certain alleles that confer\na fitness advantage to individuals possessing them. For example, beak morphology in Darwin\u2019s\nfinches differs to best utilize different food sources that naturally occur on different islands of the\nGalapagos (Fig. 1). Conversely, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation are often considered\nneutral processes because they change allele frequencies through non-adaptive mechanisms.\nProf. Christopher Blair 55\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Fig. 1. Example of natural selection using Darwin\u2019s finches.\nDifferent beak morphologies evolved in different species\ninhabiting different islands to best utilize natural food sources.\nIn other words, different habitats \u2018selected\u2019 for birds with\ncertain phenotypic characteristics. Image credit: John Gould.\nIn real populations it is important to note that many times multiple microevolutionary processes\nact in synergy to control allele frequencies. For example, a new random mutation may originate\nin a population of lizards leading to a new allele. This new mutation may confer some selective\nadvantage over other alleles already present in the population. Because individuals possessing\nthis allele are more fit, natural selection will increase the frequency of the new allele (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2. Example of how mutation and\nnatural selection may interact to shape\nallele frequencies in populations. Image\ncredit: CC BY-SA 3.0 Elembis (author).\nProf. Christopher Blair 56\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Evolutionary biologists can further classify different types of natural selection based on how\ntraits and allele frequencies shift. Figure 3 highlights some of the more common forms of\nselection. In disruptive selection, phenotypes at opposite ends of a continuum are selected\nfor. This is often a result of heterogeneous habitat where one form has higher fitness in one\necological extreme versus the other. In stabilizing selection, intermediate phenotypes have\nthe highest fitness. Stabilizing selection tends to decrease the phenotypic variance in\npopulations. Directional selection favors the evolution of one specific extreme phenotype. For\nexample, larger giraffes may exhibit higher fitness because they are better able to access food\nsources and reproduce.\nRandom mutations occur so\ninfrequently that population\ngeneticists and evolutionary\nbiologists do not consider it to be a\nmajor driving force shaping allele\nfrequencies in populations. However,\nmutation IS an important source of\nnew genetic variation. Researchers\nhave argued for decades on the\nrelative importance of neutral versus\nadaptive processes in evolution. The\nDarwinian view posits that natural\nselection (i.e. adaptive processes) is\nthe primary mechanism to explain\nallele frequencies and the evolution\nof biodiversity. This was a widely\naccepted hypothesis since Charles\nDarwin came up with his theory of\nevolution by natural selection.\nDecades later, a biologist and\nresearcher named Motoo Kimura\nsuggested that most evolutionary\nchanges are neutral and do not\nconfer a fitness advantage or\ndisadvantage to organisms. Kimura\u2019s\nneutral theory of molecular\nevolution placed a much stronger\nemphasis on genetic drift to explain\nthe evolution of life on Earth. So what\nis the correct answer? Are neutral or\nadaptive processes more important?\nFig. 3. Graphical depictions of different For the majority of organisms the\nforms of natural selection. 1 = disruptive most likely answer is that both drift\nselection; 2 = stabilizing selection; 3 = and selection are important in\ndirectional selection.

Image credit: CC BY-SA 3.0 Because genetic drift is such an\nAzcolvin429 (author). important process in evolution and\nProf. Christopher Blair 57\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu population genetics it is worthwhile to spend a bit of time to make sure that it is understood\ncorrectly. Remember that genetic drift changes allele frequencies by random processes. For\nexample, who mates with whom and which alleles are passed to which gametes during meiosis.\nIn general, genetic drift has a more\nprofound influence in smaller populations\n(Fig. 4).\nTwo additional concepts related to genetic\ndrift are bottlenecks and founder events.\nIn bottleneck events, some external force\ncan substantially reduce the number of\nindividuals (and alleles) in a population.\nBecause genetic drift has a stronger\ninfluence in smaller populations, allele\nfrequencies will drift to a greater degree\nfollowing a bottleneck, leading some\nalleles to become fixed and others to be\nlost (Fig. 5). A similar process occurs\nduring founder events, which can be\ndefined as a small subset of individuals in\na population colonizing a new location. A\ngood real-world example is the\ncolonization of Madagascar from mainland\nAfrica. Research has shown that the\nmajority of organisms colonized\nMadagascar by overseas dispersal\n(versus the continental separation of\nAfrica and Madagascar ~165 Mya).\nFounder events can lead to what is called\nfounder event speciation, or peripatric\nspeciation. How do these founder events\nlead to the creation of a new species?\nBecause founder events by definition\ninvolve a relative small number of\nindividuals from a parental population,\ngenetic drift will have a pronounced\ninfluence on allele trajectories once these\nindividuals colonize a new area (Fig. 6).\nSimilar to population bottlenecks, founder\nevents can lead to the rapid fixation or\nloss of alleles, in turn increasing the\ngenetic divergence between the parental\nFig. 4.

Founder events occur when a small subset of\nindividuals breaks off from a parental population to colonize\na new area.

Simplistic illustration of the four primary mechanisms of speciation. Allopatric and\nperipatric speciation require some type of physical barrier that leads to reproductive isolation\nof populations. Although similar, allopatric and peripatric divergence are distinguished based\non population sizes. In peripatric speciation, a small group of individuals from the parent\npopulation colonizes a new geographic area. This population then experiences rapid genetic\nchanges due to drift and selection. In parapatric speciation, a population is distributed along\nan environmental gradient. Divergent natural selection at opposite ends of the gradient\nresults in the evolution of different phenotypic characteristics. Positive assortative mating\n(mating among similar individuals) eventually leads to reproductive isolation and speciation.\nSympatric speciation results without physical or ecological barriers. Examples include the\nevolution of polyploidy in plants, and different host plant use by insects.\nProf. Christopher Blair 60\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Activity:\nA. Simulating the influence of genetic drift\nIn this lab we will be working with a population genetic simulator called PopG\n(http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/popgen/). This is a relatively simple, but useful package that\ncan be used to visualize how different microevolutionary processes shape allele frequencies\nover multiple generations. For simplicity, we will initially examine different processes\nindividually. Go ahead and open the software where you should see a window for specifying\ncertain parameters (see below).\nTake a few minutes to familiarize yourself with some of the options. You will notice that there\nare options to control each of the microevolutionary processes: genetic drift, natural selection,\nmutation, and gene flow.\nWhy is genetic drift controlled by the Population Size parameter?\nProf. Christopher Blair 61\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Hit OK to run the default settings. Hopefully you obtain a plot like the one below.\nLook at the two axes. The x-axis plots generation number whereas the y-axis shown the\nfrequency of the A allele. Each line is the figure represents a different population (you simulated\n10).\nHow would you explain what is happening in these plots?\nGo back to the settings window and change the number of generations from 100 to 1000.\nWhat happened to the A allele in several of the populations?\nNext, change the population size from 100 to 10000 and run the simulation.\nProf. Christopher Blair 62\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu How does the population size parameter influence the frequency of the A allele in each\npopulation? Does the A allele become fixed or lost in any population? How does this\ncompare to the simulation using a population size of 100?\nB. Simulating the influence of natural selection\nReturn to the settings window and click the \u2018Defaults\u2019 button to restore the default settings. We\nwill now test how natural selection might influence the frequency of the A allele. To minimize\nthe influence of drift in these simulations specify a large population size of 10000. When\nexamining natural selection we usually specify the relative fitness (w) of the different\ngenotypes. By default, a value of 1.0 is assigned to the genotype with the highest fitness, and\nthe remaining genotypes are assigned values relative to the value of 1.0. Let\u2019s start by\nassigning the following relative fitness values:\nw = 1.0\nAA\nw = 0.7\nAa\nw = 0.3\naa\nWe can also introduce another parameter called the selection coefficient (s). The selection\ncoefficient is equal to 1 \u2013 w. Using the relative fitness values above:\ns = 1 \u2013 1.0 = 0\nAA\ns = 1 \u2013 0.7 = 0.3\nAa\ns = 1 \u2013 0.3 = 0.7\naa\nRun the simulation for 10 generations using the relative fitness values above. What happens to\nthe frequency of the A allele?\nNext, run the simulation for 100 generations. You should notice that the A allele eventually\nbecomes fixed in each population. At approximately which generation does the A allele\nbecome fixed?\nProf. Christopher Blair 63\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu In the previous example the homozygous dominant genotype exhibited the highest fitness. What\nwould the simulation look like in a case of overdominance (i.e. heterozygote advantage)? Let\u2019s\nchange the relative fitness values to the following:\nw = 0.6\nAA\nw = 1.0\nAa\nw = 0.4\naa\nThe selection coefficients in this case would be\ns = 1 \u2013 0.6 = 0.4\nAA\ns = 1 \u2013 1.0 = 0\nAa\ns = 1 \u2013 0.4 = 0.6\naa\nCreate a new simulation by first resetting the default parameters. Enter the relative fitness\nvalues above to model our example of overdominance. Again, play with the population size to\ndetermine the influence of drift. Leave all other settings as the defaults.\nWhat do you notice about the frequency of the A allele over the course of 100\ngenerations? What about for 1000 generations? Hopefully your plot looks something like\nthe plot below.\nProf. Christopher Blair 64\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu How do your simulations of overdominance compare to your simulations assuming that\nthe homozygous dominant genotype had the highest fitness?\nC. Simulating the influence of gene flow\nGene flow is an extremely important microevolutionary process that can introduce new alleles\ninto populations. For example, a beneficial allele lost due to genetic drift may be reintroduced to\na population through gene flow. Gene flow can be defined as the successful migration of\nindividuals between populations followed by the transfer of genetic information (i.e. breeding).\nStudying and quantifying rates and patterns of gene flow has wide-ranging implications for many\nfields including disease surveillance, human migratory patterns, conservation biology, and\nsystematics. We can use the following equation to determine the change in allele frequency due\nto migration:\n\u2206\ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5d \u2212 \ud835\udc5d )\n! !\nwhere\n\u2206p = the change in allele frequency in the recipient population\nm = proportion of migrants within the recipient population\np = allele frequency of donor population\nD\np = allele frequency of recipient population\nR\nWhen simulating gene flow it is often interesting to model the interaction between migration\nand genetic drift. Recall that genetic drift tends to promote the loss or fixation of alleles\n(leading to reductions in genetic diversity), particularly within small populations. This may lead to\nlarge genetic differences between populations, ultimately leading to speciation. Conversely,\ngene flow can help homogenize populations and maintain a stable number of alleles.\nStart a new simulation by restoring the default settings. Click OK to run the simulation for 100\ngenerations. You should see that the frequency of the A allele fluctuates considerably due to\ngenetic drift alone (all other microevolutionary processes were controlled for). What happens if\nyou introduce some migration between each of your 10 populations? Open up the settings\nwindow and enter a value of 0.3 for migration rate between populations.\nDiscuss how the introduction of gene flow influenced allele frequencies of the A allele.\nProf. Christopher Blair 65\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Do you think that gene flow would have a larger or smaller affect on allele frequencies in\nlarge populations? Explain your reasoning. It may be useful to perform additional\nsimulations if needed.\nD. Simulating the influence of mutation\nMutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation in populations. Mutation can create new\nalleles in populations, which can then be acted upon by other microevolutionary processes such\nas drift and selection. It\u2019s important to note that although mutation can create new alleles, it\ndoes not substantially alter allele frequencies because mutation is a relatively infrequent event.\nMutation rate is commonly represented by the Greek symbol \u00b5 and can be expressed in units\nsuch as generations or time (e.g. per million years). For example, the typical mutation rate of\nvertebrate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) ranges between about 0.8 \u2013 2.0 substitutions per site\nper million years. Site refers to a specific base position in an alignment of homologous DNA\nsequences. Mutation rates of animal nuclear DNA (nDNA) are often an order of magnitude\nslower. Interestingly, plant mtDNA evolves at a much slower rate than plant nDNA. Thus,\ndifferent genomes have the ability to provide different amounts of evolutionary information, and\ntarget genes can be tailored to one\u2019s specific research objectives. We can use the equation\nbelow to calculate the frequency of the A allele after a specific number of generations, assuming\nwe know the starting allele frequency and the mutation rate.\n\ud835\udc5d\n1 \u2212 \ud835\udf07 ! = !\n\ud835\udc5d\n!\nwhere\n\u00b5 = mutation rate from the A allele to the a allele\nt = time (e.g. number of generations)\np = frequency of the A allele after t generations\nt\np = initial frequency of the A allele\n0\nWe can rearrange the problem to solve for p:\nt\n\ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5d \u2217 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf07 !\n! !\nCalculate the frequency of the A allele after 500 generations, assuming a mutation rate of\n0.0001 per generation and an initial frequency of 0.5.\nProf. Christopher Blair 66\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Let\u2019s perform some simulations to observe how mutation alters allele frequencies. Setup a new\nrun by first restoring the defaults. To minimize the influence of drift, set the population size to\n10000. Enter 0.0001 for the mutation rate from A to a and run the simulation for 500\ngenerations.\nWhat do the results suggest? Would you say that the frequency of the A allele is\nchanging dramatically? Explain your reasoning.\nNext, go back to the settings window and enter a rate of 0.001 for the mutation rate from a to A.\nand rerun the simulation.\nHow do these results differ from the previous simulation that assumed no mutation from\na to A?\nFinally, let\u2019s try to model a situation where mutation creates a new beneficial allele that is acted\nupon by natural selection. Theory predicts that the beneficial allele should become fixed in a\npopulation if the population size is large enough to minimize the affect of drift. In this example,\nwe will assume that the population was originally monomorphic for the a allele, and mutation\nintroduces a beneficial A allele. We will also assume that the mutation rate from A to a is the\nsame as the mutation rate from a to A (0.00001). We will use the following relative fitness\nvalues:\nw = 1.0\nAA\nw = 0.7\nAa\nw = 0.3\naa\nYour settings should look like the diagram below.\nProf. Christopher Blair 67\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Provide a detailed description of what is happening in your model.\nIf time permits, perform additional simulations of your choosing, mixing and matching\ndifferent processes to see how allele frequencies are affected. Upon successful\ncompletion of the lab you should be comfortable with how the different\nmicroevolutionary processes interact to shape allele frequencies in populations.\nProf. Christopher Blair 68\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Dr. Christopher Blair\nBIO2450L\nGenetics\nLabs 8-9\nDNA Fingerprinting\nBackground:\nThroughout the first half of the semester we focused our efforts on classic genetic experiments\nincluding crosses. We will now turn our attention to different types of molecular genetic\ntechniques that can be used to assess levels of genetic variation. The number of molecular\ngenetic techniques available to researchers is quite large, and it is imperative that the correct\nmethod is used to address the question of interest.\nDNA fingerprinting is a widely used approach to identify organisms and determine evolutionary\nrelatedness. As an example, DNA fingerprinting is commonly used in forensics to identify\ncriminals from a set of possible suspects. In short, residual traces of DNA are collected from a\ncrime scene along with DNA samples from multiple suspects. DNA fingerprints are then\nconstructed from the crime scene DNA and compared to all other DNA samples (Fig. 1).\nMatches in banding patterns between the crime scene sample and one of the suspects would\nimplicate that particular suspect in the crime.\nFig. 1. Example of DNA fingerprinting. Each band on an agarose gel\nindicates a specific fragment of DNA. Each vertical column constitutes a\ndifferent sample. Wells on the far left and far right contain a DNA ladder\nillustrating bands of known size. DNA ladders are used to help\ndetermine the size (in base pairs) of sample DNA fragments. Image\ncredit: CC BY-SA 3.0 Rkalendar (author).\nProf. Christopher Blair 69\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu The technique can also be used to indicate paternity in a set of potential fathers. Figure 2\ndepicts the results of a DNA fingerprinting experiment focused on determining which of three\nmen was the father of a child. \u2018M\u2019 represents the DNA fingerprint of the mother, \u2018Ch\u2019 is the\nfingerprint of the child, and samples 1, 2 and 3 are the fingerprints from the three potential\nfathers. Remember that in diploid organisms (including humans), there are two alleles per locus.\nLooking at the banding pattern below, which male is the most likely father?\nFig. 2. Simplified example of how DNA fingerprinting techniques can be\nused to determine paternity among multiple candidate fathers. M =\nmother; Ch = child; 1,2 and 3 = potential fathers. Image credit: CC BY-\nSA 3.0 Helixitta (author).\nAs alluded to above, multiple molecular genetic techniques may be used to construct a DNA\nfingerprint to use for identification or relatedness purposes. One historically common method is\ntermed restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). In this method, one or multiple\nrestriction enzymes are used to cut the DNA at specific regions of the genome. Most\nrestriction enzymes are derived from different species of bacteria and cleave DNA at specific\nrecognition sites. Figure 3 illustrates the process of DNA digestion by the enzyme HindIII. This\nparticular enzyme recognizes and cuts the following sequence:\n5\u2019 \u2013 AAGCTT \u2013 3\u2019\n3\u2019 \u2013 TTCGAA \u2013 5\u2019\nProf. Christopher Blair 70\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Notice that following digestion, the cut\nDNA protrudes as overhangs that are\ncalled sticky ends. This contrasts with\nrestriction enzymes that result in blunt-\nended DNA fragments lacking an\noverhang. Once DNA is cut with a\nrestriction enzyme, the fragmented DNA\ncan be reattached through an enzyme\ncalled DNA ligase. Alternatively, a\nplasmid could also be cut with the\nsame restriction enzyme, and the DNA\nfragment of interest may be inserted into\nthe plasmid. The recombinant plasmid\ncan then be introduced into a bacterial\ncell (e.g. E. coli) and continuously\nreplicated during binary fission. This is\npart of the technique termed molecular\ncloning.\nThe first step in a typical fingerprinting\nanalysis is to digest different DNA\nsamples with a restriction enzyme. Next,\nthe resulting fragments are separated\nusing a technique called horizontal\nagarose gel electrophoresis. Digested\nDNA samples are first loaded into Fig. 3. Graphical depiction of DNA digestion using the\nseparate wells of an agarose gel. The restriction enzyme HindIII. Note the production of\nDNA is generally mixed with a loading overhangs following digestion. Image credit: CC BY-SA\ndye to assist in loading the samples into 4.0 Helixitta (author).\nthe gel. A stain is needed to actually\nvisualize DNA banding patterns on the gel (i.e. DNA by itself is colorless). Along with the\ndigested DNA samples, we want to load a DNA ladder (usually in the first well) to give us a\nbroad idea of fragment sizes (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4. DNA electrophoresis\nexample. Gel illustrates three\ndifferent banding patterns\nfrom three different samples.\nThe marker is included to\nhelp determine the size (bp)\nof each fragment. Figure to\nthe right shows the inverse\nrelationship between\ndistance migrated in the gel\nversus fragment size. Image\ncredit: CC BY-SA 4.0\nMckenzielower (author).\nProf. Christopher Blair 71\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Once all the samples are loaded in the gel inside of the gel rig, we apply an electrical current to\n\u2018electrophorese\u2019 the DNA through the gel. DNA is a negatively charged molecule and will\nmigrate towards a positive electric field (the red side of the gel apparatus). DNA migrates at a\nrate inversely proportional to the size of the fragment (i.e. shorter fragments migrate at a faster\nrate). As you can see from Fig. 4, fragments that are 1,000 bp in size do not migrate far from the\nwell where the sample was loaded. Depending upon the specific application, you\u2019ll want to run\nthe gel for ~100 V for 30 min or so. As a general rule of thumb, I tend to stop the current once\nthe DNA has migrated about halfway down the gel.\nNote that in a more typical RFLP-based DNA fingerprinting experiment, a subsequent step\ncalled Southern blotting is needed in order to visualize and compare fragments. The reason is\nthat when human DNA (or DNA from any other eukaryote with a large genome) is cut with a\nrestriction enzyme and run out on a gel, distinct bands are not easily detectable. Instead, the\nlikely outcome is a broad smear encompassing a large range of fragment sizes. To help resolve\ndistinct bands that can be compared among samples, radioactive DNA probes complementary\nto the DNA samples are used that hybridize to the digested DNA. In our lab exercise the crime\nscene DNA and suspect DNA samples originate from plasmids that contain relatively few cut\nsites. Thus, there is no need to perform the laborious task of Southern blotting. In other words,\ndistinct bands can be easily visualized on a gel following restriction digestion.\nActivity:\nThis will be a two-week lab exercise to familiarize you will techniques commonly used in a\nmolecular genetics laboratory. You will be working in groups of four during these two weeks.\nThus, each lab section should contain four groups of four students. The breakdown of the two\nweeks is as follows:\nWeek 8: Background, pipette review, restriction enzyme digestion\nWeek 9: Gel electrophoresis of DNA digests, analysis, review questions\n*Note that nitrile or latex gloves are required. It is up to you to bring these to lab, as your\ninstructor and technicians will not supply them.\nWeek 8:\nFollowing the background lecture material, it may be worthwhile to practice your pipetting skills\nbefore you begin the lab exercises. The technicians have provided practice cards and plates\nthat you can use to practice as you see fit. Do not move on to the actual lab exercise until\nyou feel comfortable with pipetting.\nA. Pipetting and Measurements\nTypes of Micropipettors\nPipettors are made by many different manufacturers and thus all do not look the same.\nLearning to correctly use one type of pipettor will provide you the knowledge to use others as\nthey share the same method of distributing small volumes. This lab will illustrate the Rainin\nPipetman\u00ae micropipettors.\nProf. Christopher Blair 72\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu The top of the plunger shows the pipettor size for the Pipetman models. Each pipettor has its\nown volume range and it is CRITICAL to use a pipettor only in its proper volume range. The \u201cP-\nnumber\u201d represents the maximum volume in \u00b5L that the pipettor can measure. Pipettors are\nmore accurate in the upper part of their range. For example, 20 \u00b5L should be measured with a\nP20 rather than with a P200. The four pipettor sizes (P10, P20, P200, P1000) used in our lab\nwill measure from 1 \u00b5L \u2013 1000 \u00b5L as shown below (Figs. 5,6).\nCorrectly Adjusting the Pipettors\nFig. 5. Gilson Pipetman pipetting ranges chart. Note that the P200\nofficially has a range from 50-200\u00b5l. Refer to PowerPoint slides for color\nversion.\nProf. Christopher Blair 73\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Tutorial on Proper Usage\nFig. 6. Pipetting sequence. Ensure the plunger is depressed outside of the liquid to displace air\nand avoid blowing bubbles into solution. Carefully draw the plunger up slowly and follow the\nliquid to avoid drawing air. Depress the plunger in destination tube to the first stop. Depress to\nthe second stop if fluid remains in the tip to expel full volume. Refer to PowerPoint slides for\ncolor version.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEy_NGDfo_8\nRules for use of the micropipettors:\nThese are precision instruments which can easily be damaged. Treat them with respect and\ncare. They are essential for your success in this course and shared amongst numerous\nstudents.\n1. Never measure higher or lower than the range of the pipettor allows.\n2. Never turn the volume adjuster above or below the range indicated on the pipettor or you risk\nbreaking the instrument.\n3. Never allow liquid to get into the micropipettor.\n\u00a7 this causes contamination\n\u00a7 this weakens the seal on the o-rings and can damage them\n4. Never use the micropipettor without an appropriate tip. Never force a tip that doesn\u2019t fit.\n5. Never invert or lay down the micropipettor with liquid in the tip.\n\u00a7 liquids will roll into the piston this way\n6. Never let the plunger snap back when filling or ejecting liquid.\nProf. Christopher Blair 74\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 7. Never immerse the barrel in fluid.\n\u00a7 this causes contamination\n8. Never set the micropipettor on the edge of the bench; this may result in the micropipettor falling\nor being knocked onto the floor.\nExercise: Pipetting Practice\n1. Prepare seven dye mixtures as illustrated in the table below.\n-One student mixes samples in Column A and a second mixes in Column C\n-Column B is left empty and used if one student makes a mistake\n2. Each dye mixture prepared in one well to reach a total volume of 45 \u00b5l.\n3. Pipet 10 \u00b5l in triplicate from each well of the mixing plate into the center of the appropriate\ncircles on the target card\nProf. Christopher Blair 75\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu B. Setting up restriction enzyme digests\nNow we are ready to set up the restriction digests. Each group should have one tube labeled\nENZ that contains the rehydrated restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI. It important to keep the\nrestriction enzymes on ice during the preparation of restriction digests as enzymatic activity\ndecreases at higher temperatures.\n1. Label colored tubes as follows:\nGreen = CS (crime scene DNA)\nBlue = S1 (Suspect 1)\nOrange = S2 (Suspect 2)\nViolet = S3 (Suspect 3)\nPink = S4 (Suspect 4)\nYellow = S5 (Suspect 5)\nClear = negative control\nAlso include your name or initials, date, and lab section on your tubes.\nProf. Christopher Blair 76\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 2. The technicians should have already rehydrated both the enzymes and the DNA\nsamples and have transferred 10 ul of the stock DNA into the corresponding colored\ntube. For your negative control you will use water.\n3. Add 10 ul of the enzyme mix to each tube. Again, make sure to use a fresh pipette\ntip between samples to prevent contamination. Pipette the enzyme, sample\nmixture up and down a few times to homogenize the sample. Close lid on all caps.\n4. If you see bubbles in your tubes, gently flick the bottom or gently tap the tube on\nyour lab bench. Make sure the cap is securely closed to prevent spillage. You may\nalso wish to briefly vortex the sample and/or place it in a mini- or microcentrifuge for\na few seconds. When using a microcentrifuge you must make sure it is\nbalanced or you may damage the rotor.\n5. Place the tubes inside a dry bath and incubate for 45 min at 37\u00baC.\n6. When the incubation period is complete, store digests in the refrigerator until the\nfollowing week.\nWeek 9:\nThis week we will quantify the results of your restriction digests to determine if any of the\nsuspect DNA samples match the DNA found at the crime scene. Remember that a suspect DNA\nbanding pattern matching the pattern at the crime scene would implicate that individual in the\ncrime.\nEach class will prepare four 1% gels in total.\n1. For each gel, combine 50 ml of TBE buffer with 0.5 g agarose. Swirl mixture.\n2. Microwave mixture for 30 sec \u2013 1 min. Using protective gloves, remove the mixture\nfrom the microwave and swirl. Be careful as the flask will be hot to the touch! If\nneeded, microwave for another 30 sec \u2013 1 min. The agarose should be completely\ndissolved in the buffer solution and look clear. Make sure that the solution does not\nspill out of the flask when boiling.\n3. Add 5 ul of SYBR safe solution to each flask and swirl. This is the stain that will help\nyou visualize the DNA in your gel.\n4. Gently pour solution into a gel casting tray and place one comb into the gel.\n5. Wait for gel to solidify (~20 min).\n6. Remove your restriction digests from the refrigerator. Make sure there are no\nbubbles inside the tubes. Gently flick tubes, tap them on the bench, vortex them, or\nspin them in a microcentrifuge if needed.\n7. Add 5 ul of loading dye to each sample. The loading dye is used to help load your\nsamples into the gel. Make sure you use a different pipette tip between samples!\nProf. Christopher Blair 77\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Once the loading dye is added, each tube should contain a total of 25 ul (10 ul DNA\n+ 10 ul restriction enzyme + 5 ul loading dye).\n8. When solidified, carefully transfer the gel to an electrophoresis chamber. Make sure\nto fill the chamber with enough buffer to cover your gel. Also, make sure that the\nwells of the gel are near the black electrode (not the red).\n9. Load the gels following the diagram below. Make sure to use a different pipette tip\nfor each sample when loading. Use 10 ul of the size standard (S) and 20 ul of\neach sample. Place your negative control in last well.\nGroup samples\nS CS S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 -\n10. Place the lid on the electrophoresis chamber and plug the correct electrodes into the\npower supply and the gel rig (black to black, red to red).\n11. Turn on power supply and set to 100 V. Electrophorese your samples for ~30-45\nmin.\n12. While waiting, work on the review questions.\n13. Turn off the power supply after the loading dye is approximately halfway through the\ngel. With gloves, carefully remove gel from chamber and place on transilluminator to\nvisualize the results. Do any of the samples match? Is it possible that any of the\nsuspects committed the crime?\n14. Use a ruler to measure the distance (mm) of each band from the well.\nDetermine the approximate size of the band (in bp) by comparing it with the\nknown size standard. Fill-in the table on the next page. Use the table to plot the\ndata in the following plot. Your x-axis should be distance (mm) and the y-axis\nshould be fragment size (bp). Be sure to label the axes! What is the general\nshape of the curve? How can the figure be used to estimate the size of an\nunknown fragment?\nProf. Christopher Blair 78\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Size Standard Crime Scene Suspect 1 Suspect 2 Suspect 3 Suspect 4 Suspect 5\nSample\nBand Distance Actual Distance Approx Distance Approx Distance Approx Distance Approx Distance Approx Distance Approx\n(mm) size (mm) size (mm) size (mm) size (mm) size (mm) size (mm) size\n(bp) (bp) (bp) (bp) (bp) (bp) (bp)\n1 11 23130\n2 13 9416\n3 15 6557\n4 18 4361\n5 23 2322\n6 24 2027\nProf. Christopher Blair 79\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Prof. Christopher Blair 80\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Review Questions\n1. If a restriction enzyme digested a linear piece of DNA in two places, how many\nfragments would result? What if the DNA was circular instead of linear?\n2. In gel electrophoresis, why is the DNA loaded near the negative end (cathode) of the\nchamber?\n3. How does this experiment compare and contrast to a typical RFLP DNA\nfingerprinting assay?\n4. Describe the role of restriction enzymes in constructing a recombinant plasmid.\n5. Which of the suspect DNA samples contained the largest DNA fragment? What\nabout the smallest?\nProf. Christopher Blair 81\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 6. A more modern molecular technique to RFLP fingerprinting is called Amplified\nFragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). In AFLP analysis, restriction enzymes are\nagain used to digest genomic DNA into multiple fragments. Next, adapters\ncomplementary to restriction site overhangs are ligated to the fragments using an\nenzyme called DNA ligase. These adapters are complementary to primers used to\namplify the fragments using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Can you think of\nany potential benefits of AFLP analysis over RFLP? Explain your reasoning.\n7. Using what you now know about restriction enzymes, why do you suppose that wells\nin the gel contained more than one band?\n8. How would the voltage used change the rate of DNA electrophoresis? Can you think\nof any benefit of running the samples at a slow rate?\n9. What is the purpose of including a negative control in your experiment? Would DNA\nbands in the negative control influence your conclusions? Explain your reasoning.\n10. What would your gel look like if the DNA were not fragmented?\nProf. Christopher Blair 82\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 11. In your own words, describe the utility of molecular genetic approaches to individual\nidentification and estimation of relatedness. How can restriction enzymes be used to\nlink a suspect to a crime scene?\n12. Do any of the suspects have the same banding pattern? If not, does it mean that the\nindividuals are not related? Explain your reasoning.\nProf. Christopher Blair 83\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Dr. Christopher Blair\nBIO2450L\nGenetics\nLabs 10-12\nMolecular Genetics, PCR, and Genotyping\nBackground:\nFor the next three weeks we will be performing two molecular genetics experiments to introduce\nyou to some commonly used laboratory techniques to assay genetic variation at the molecular\nlevel. All of these experiments rely on a technique called Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nPCR has revolutionized the study of genetics, helping to provide insight in a wide variety of\ndisciplines ranging from medical genetics to ecology and evolutionary biology. The purpose of\nPCR is to exponentially amplify a specific gene or fragment of DNA, which is subsequently\ncalled an amplicon. Figure 1 highlights the generally procedure of PCR. Note that gloves are\nrequired throughout all phases of these experiments.\nFig. 1. Graphical depiction of the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Green\nfragments represent the template DNA to be amplified. Primers are shown in red, and\namplicons are shown in blue. Image credit: CC BY-SA 3.0 Enzoklop (author).\nThe general procedure for PCR is as follows:\n1. Determine the fragment of DNA to be amplified. This is usually between 500-1000\nbp.\nProf. Christopher Blair 84\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 2. Design or obtain primers flanking the region of interest that are complementary to the\ntemplate DNA. Primers are needed to \u2018prime\u2019 the reaction as DNA polymerase can\nonly extend DNA in a 5\u2019 \u2013 3\u2019 direction.\n3. Create a master mix containing all the needed reagents. Master mixes usually\ncontain water, PCR buffer, dNTPs (nucleotides), both primers, taq DNA\npolymerase, and the template DNA.\n4. Reactions are usually performed in a machine called a thermal cycler. Thermal\ncyclers automate the cycling of different temperatures that are needed to amplify the\nDNA. Multiple cycles are generally performed (e.g. 35), with each cycle consisting of\nthree steps: denaturation (95 \u00baC), primer annealing (varies, generally between 50 \u00baC\n\u2013 60 \u00baC), and extension (72 \u00baC). In addition, there is usually a final extension phase\nand an initial denaturation phase.\n5. When the PCR is complete, we can use gel electrophoresis to determine if the\nreaction worked. In many cases, we expect to see a single band in each well,\nparticularly if we amplify a haploid locus (e.g. mtDNA, cpDNA). Conversely, in some\ncases individual alleles may be seen in a diploid marker, but this requires that the\nalleles are quite different in size and/or a polyacrylamide gel is used instead of\nagarose.\n6. The next step is to purify the PCR product to remove primers and unincorporated\nnucleotides. This can be done via spin column techniques or with enzymatic\ntreatment.\n7. The purified PCR products can then be used for downstream applications such as\ndirect DNA sequencing.\nLab overview and objectives:\nOver the course of three weeks we will be performing two sets of experiments to introduce\nstudents to fundamental concepts in molecular genetics (Fig. 2). Upon completion of these labs\nstudents should be able to explain how restriction enzymes work, discuss what PCR is and how\nit is commonly used in molecular biology and genetics, understand why gel electrophoresis is\nperformed, and demonstrate basic knowledge of Sanger sequencing and scoring of genetic\npolymorphisms.\nProf. Christopher Blair 85\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Labs 10-12\nPTC exercise GMO exercise\nDNA extraction DNA extraction\nWeek 10\nPCR PCR\nSend amplicons for sequencing\nWeek 11 Cast gels for gel electrophoresis Cast gels for gel electrophoresis\nRestriction enzyme digestion Gel electrophoresis\nGel electrophoresis\nWeek 12 Lecture Lecture\nData analysis Data analysis\nReview questions Review questions\nFig. 2. General overview of lab activities for Weeks 10-12. Each week students will\nsimultaneously work on both the PTC and GMO activities.\nProf. Christopher Blair 86\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Experiment A: PTC Genetics\nAs stated above, we will be performing two different experiments over the next three weeks.\nThe first experiment focuses on the molecular genetics of a taste receptor found on the tongues\nof vertebrates. Many animals have specific taste receptors that help determine if a substance is\nbitter. This is often useful, as bitter substances are generally correlated with some level of\ntoxicity. For this lab, we will be working with a synthetic, non-toxic chemical called\nphenylthiocarbamide (PTC) to mimic naturally occurring bitter compounds.\nHumans can be classified along a spectrum of tasting ability for PTC. Some people detect a\nstrong bitterness to the substance, whereas others taste nothing. The receptor protein is\nencoded by an autosomal gene called TAS2R38, which contains two common alleles and\nseveral uncommon variants. Differences in the two common alleles are due to a single\nnucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that changes one of the amino acids. The tasting allele, T, is\nthought as dominant to the non-tasting allele, t. Homozygous dominant (TT) individuals\ngenerally describe the taste as very bitter, heterozygotes (Tt) may detect mild bitterness, and\nhomozygous recessive individuals (tt) will not detect any bitterness. Although many researchers\ntreat the genetics of PTC tasting as a simple Mendelian trait (one gene, two alleles, complete\ndominance), the actual genetics is probably more complex involving many genes and also\nincluding an environmental component. Thus, the ability to taste PTC is likely a polygenic trait.\nEven at the single gene level (TAS2R38), there is no consensus as to whether the trait exhibits\ncomplete versus incomplete dominance.\nSince having the tasting allele, T, would seem like a benefit due to an organism\u2019s ability to\ndetect potentially toxic compounds (and avoid or adapt to them), why has natural selection not\nremoved the non-tasting allele, t, from populations? One reason might be balancing selection\ndue to overdominance (heterozygote advantage). Balancing selection tends to maintain\nmultiple alleles in a population. In the case of PTC, there may be some selective advantage of\npossessing the non-tasting allele in the heterozygote form (similar to the case of sickle-cell\nanemia). Clearly, more research needs to be conducted to determine the potential benefit of the\nnon-tasting allele.\nYou will use PCR to amplify a 221 bp fragment of the PTC gene to determine the genotypes\ncorresponding with the different phenotypes (tasting ability). Before beginning the molecular\ncomponent of this lab we will quantify the phenotypes of the class in the table below. Each\nperson should taste the control paper first to make sure no bitterness is detected.\nYour PTC phenotype:______________\nClass Data\nPhenotype Number Frequency\nStrong PTC Taster\nWeak PTC Taster\nNon-Tasters\nTotal 1.0\nBased on the results in the table above, does it appear that PTC tasting ability follows\nsimple Mendelian inheritance patterns? Explain your reasoning.\nProf. Christopher Blair 87\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Procedure:\nA general overview of the PTC laboratory procedure is depicted in Fig. 3. Note that allelic\ndifferences are due to a G-C polymorphism at base 145 that changes the amino acid from\nproline (taster) to alanine (non-taster). Use the gel diagram below to draw predicted banding\npatterns for each of the three digested genotypes and an undigested amplicon.

Use sterile cytobrush and insert into mouth.\n2. Brush cytobrush on inside of cheek 25 times.\n3. Swirl cytobrush in 100 \u00b5l of Chelex suspension (10% w/v).\n4. Place centrifuge tube with Chelex and cell suspension on 100 \u00b0C heat block for 10\nminutes.\n5. Centrifuge tubes at maximum speed for 5 minutes.\n6. DNA is in the supernatant (avoid beads at bottom).\n7. Store DNA in -20 \u00b0C.\nDay One (Week 10) - PCR with PCR beads and DNA sequencing\n1. Add 22 \u00b5l of primer mix (forward, reverse and loading dye) to PCR tubes containing PCR\nbeads.\nPrimers:\n5\u2019-CCTTCGTTTTCTTGGTGAATTTTTGGGATGTAGTGAAGAGGCGG-3\u2019 (Forward\nPrimer)\n5\u2032-AGGTTGGCTTGGTTTGCAATCATC-3\u2032 (Reverse Primer)\n2. Ensure that the bead is dissolved.\n3. Add 3 \u00b5l of DNA.\n4. Load samples on the thermal cyclers and run the \u201cPTC\u201d program.\n5. Store amplified product at -20 \u00b0C until you are ready for the next stage of the\nexperiment.\nWhen the PCRs are complete, your instructor will send your amplicons for DNA sequencing\nusing the Sanger sequencing technique. An overview of the Sanger method is provided in\nFig. 4. Briefly, the PCR amplicon is combined with one of the primer sequences (forward or\nreverse), DNA polymerase, dNTPs and ddNTPs and cycled in a thermal cycler at certain\nconditions. During primer elongation, a ddNTP (instead of a dNTP) can become added to\nthe growing sequence. The addition of a ddNTP causes termination of elongation, which is\nwhy Sanger sequencing is also called chain termination. Sequencing fragments are then\nseparated by gel or capillary electrophoresis and a laser is able to differentiate between\nProf. Christopher Blair 89\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu individual bases to produce an electropherogram. The reverse primer will be used for\nsequencing in this experiment.\nFig. 4. Overview of the Sanger method of DNA sequencing. Note that the addition of a ddNTP\n(instead of a dNTP) causes the termination of strand synthesis. Fragments are then sorted by\nsize and a laser is used to determine the sequence of bases (nucleotides).

Recall that the recognition site for the HaeIII enzyme is GG|CC. In other words,\nthe enzyme will only cut the DNA at these sequences.\nGel Casting (Gels will be used for both laboratory experiments)\n1. Each group of four (4) will prepare a 3% agarose gel.\n2. In a flask, combine 100 ml TBE buffer with 3 g agarose. Gently mix the solution.\n3. Microwave the buffer-agarose mixture at 30 sec intervals, mixing the solution between\nheating. Make sure you wear protective gloves as the flask will be hot! The agarose\nshould be completely dissolved in the buffer and be clear.\n4. Add 10 ul SYBR Safe DNA stain to the hot flask and gently mix.\n5. Place two combs into each gel apparatus. Make sure the comb with 10 wells is\nplaced facing down. Let the hot gel mixture cool a bit before pouring (~3 min). Carefully\npour the gel into the gel tray, making sure that no liquid is spilled.\n6. Gels may be placed in the refrigerator to expedite solidification. This should take no\nmore than 20 min.\nDNA digestion\n1. Each student should obtain two new microcentrifuge tubes. Label one tube with your\ninitials and the letter \u2018U\u2019 for undigested and one tube with the letter \u2018D\u2019 for digested.\n2. Transfer 5 ul of PCR product into tube labeled \u2018U\u2019 and 5 ul into tube labeled \u2018D\u2019.\n3. Add 1 ul of HaeIII enzyme to tube \u2018D\u2019.\n4. Briefly vortex or pipette-mix the mixture to homogenate.\n5. Incubate for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C.\n6. Save the remaining 15 ul of PCR product for DNA sequencing.\nGel electrophoresis\nWe will use gel electrophoresis to separate and visualize the DNA fragments resulting from\ndigestion with the HaeIII restriction enzyme. Your goal is to compare the observed\ngenotypes among individuals.\n1. When adequately solidified, place gel in gel apparatus. Make sure that the wells of\nthe gel are near the negative (black) electrode.\nProf. Christopher Blair 91\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 2. Each student should load two samples into the gel\u2014one undigested sample and one\ndigested with the restriction enzyme. Each gel should also include a DNA ladder to\nhelp size the fragments (load 5 ul of the DNA ladder). Below is a representative\ndiagram of how the gels should be loaded for one group. U = undigested; D =\ndigested.\nMarker Student 1 Student 2 Student 3 Student 4\nU D U D U D U D\n3. Run gel for 20 min at 120 V.\n4. Visualize results using transilluminator and obtain genotypes. Pay particular attention\nto your own banding pattern.\n5. Use your smartphone to take a picture of your gel.\nDay Three (Week 12) \u2013 Lecture, data analysis, and review questions\n1. Obtain your DNA sequence from your instructor and analyze it using the software\nFinchTV. What nucleotide is present at ~position 146? What does this indicate? Use\nFig. 3 to help determine your genotype.\n2. Compare and contrast your DNA sequence to your banding pattern on your gel. Do both\nmethods yield the same results? Can you unambiguously determine if you are\nhomozygous or heterozygous?\nProf. Christopher Blair 92\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Review questions:\n1. Draw your banding patterns in the gel image below.\nMarker Student\nU D\n2. What is your genotype? How does your genotype correspond to your phenotype?\n3. Are you homozygous or heterozygous? How do you know?\n4. Fill-in the table below regarding observed genotypes for the entire class. How do the\ngenotype frequencies compare with the phenotype frequencies documented in the\nprevious table?\nClass Data\nGenotype Number Frequency\nTT\nTt\ntt\nTotal 1.0\n5. Use the information in the table to calculate the frequency of the two alleles.\nProf. Christopher Blair 93\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 6. Use the Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equation to determine if the class data deviate\nsignificantly from HW expectations. Remember that significance is often assessed by\nusing the chi square test with 1 df (when using two alleles). The critical value\naccording to the table is 3.841 using an alpha of 0.05. The HW formula is as follows:\n\ud835\udc5d!+2\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e+\ud835\udc5e! = 1\n\ud835\udc5d+\ud835\udc5e = 1\n7. If diploid species possess two alleles per locus, how do you explain the banding\npatterns seen in the samples?\n8. In your own words, discuss the benefits of possessing the tasting allele. After all,\nphenylthiocarbamide is not a naturally occurring compound. Why might the non-\ntasting allele be maintained in natural populations?\nProf. Christopher Blair 94\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 9. How do your genotyping results correspond to your DNA sequence? Remember that\nin this experiment the two alleles are distinguished by a G-C substitution at base\n~146. What would you expect the sequence of a heterozygote to look like? Explain\nyour reasoning.\n10. Explain how restriction enzymes work and how HaeIII was able to discriminate\nbetween the tasting and non-tasting alleles.\n11. Discuss how PCR works and how it can be used to clonally amplify specific\nfragments of DNA.\nProf. Christopher Blair 95\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Experiment B: Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)\nThere is continual interest in the potential uses of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to\nbenefit both humans and natural ecosystems. This is particularly true with GMO crop species.\nBy inserting foreign genetic material into species of agricultural importance, scientists can\ncreate strains that are pesticide- and herbicide-resistant, produce larger fruits, and exhibit\nparticular nutrient composition in their species of interest. Unfortunately, creating GMO crops is\nan expensive and laborious process. Furthermore, there is considerable debate as to the pros\nand cons of creating GMOs. For example, opponents argue that GMOs will lead to the evolution\nof herbicide-resistant weeds and that there may be negative health outcomes from consuming\nGMO species.\nThe first step to create a GMO is to identify a gene and trait of interest. As an example, genes\nfrom the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis are commonly inserted into crop species because\nmany of these genes encode proteins that serve as a pesticide to certain insect species. Thus,\nfarmers will not have to spray harmful (and carcinogenic) synthetic pesticides on crops, which\nmay have a substantial influence on human health. The next step is to isolate, or clone, the\ngene of interest into a DNA vector. A DNA vector is a circular piece of DNA (usually a bacteria\nplasmid) that can be genetically engineered based on its proposed usage. In addition to cloning\nthe gene of interest, other fragments of foreign DNA are also inserted into a vector. These\ninclude regulator sequences such as a 35S promoter region from the cauliflower mosaic virus\n(CaMV 35S) and a terminator region from the nopaline synthase (NOS) gene from the\nbacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. These regulatory elements are commonly used in GMOs\nto maintain high levels of gene expression in nearly all the cells of the plant. Next, researchers\nmust find a way to introduce the foreign DNA into plant cells. It is generally not possible to\ntransform all the cells of a grown plant. Instead, scientists isolate a few plant cells that will\nincorporate the exogenous DNA. Multiple techniques can be used for transformation including\ninfection with bacterial species, using a \u2018gene gun\u2019 to bombard cells with the DNA, or using a\ntechnique called electroporation to create pores in plant cell membranes. Regardless of the\ntechnique, in order to be effective the foreign DNA must pass through the cell wall, plasma\nmembrane, and nuclear membrane to be successfully incorporated inside the plant cell\ngenome. The next step is to determine which plant cells have taken up the foreign DNA into\ntheir genome. To aid in this endeavor, additional selectable markers are often used. Finally,\nresearchers will add hormones to the plant cells to stimulate cell division, which will eventually\nyield an entire plant composed of genetically modified cells.\nFor this lab exercise, you will test common grocery items to determine if they are genetically\nmodified. Approximately 85% of GMOs contain either the CaMV 35S promoter or the NOS\nterminator sequence, both of which are ~200 bp long. Common GMOs in the United States\ninclude corn and soy-based products. In addition, many strains of papaya often contain GMO\nsequences that can be determined using molecular genetic techniques. Wheat and rice\nproducts are generally lacking genetic modification. Throughout this exercise, multiple controls\nwill be used to make sure that the experiments runs adequately. This is explained in greater\ndetail below.\nProf. Christopher Blair 96\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu As the molecular techniques in this exercise are similar to those used in the PTC genotyping\nlab, we will work on both exercises simultaneously over the course of three weeks (Weeks 10-\n12). The GMO lab will be divided as follows:\nGMO Lab Schedule\nWeek 10 \u2013 DNA extraction from food samples and PCR\nWeek 11 \u2013 Gel casting and electrophoresis\nWeek 12 \u2013 Lecture, data analysis, and review\nDay One (Week 10) \u2013 DNA extraction from food samples\nYou were asked to bring in food items from the grocery store to test for evidence of a GMO. A\nclass of 16 should be divided into four groups of four. There should be enough supplies for each\ngroup to test a different food item.\n1. Obtain two 1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes. Label one as \u201cnon-GMO\u201d and the second as\nyour test food.\n2. Place a crumb of \u201cnon-GMO\u201d (that comes with the lab) or your test food into the\ncorresponding tube.\n3. Add 50 ul dH O to each tube.\n2\n4. Twist a clean plastic pestle against the inner surface of the tube for 1 min to\nforcefully grind the crumb. Be sure to use a different pestle for each sample.\n5. Add 300 ul of InstaGene matrix to each tube, pipette up and down a few times to\nhomogenize the ground slurry with the InstaGene matrix.\n6. Place each tube (non-GMO control, test sample) in a dry bath and incubate for 5 min\nat 95 \u00baC.\n7. Place tubes in a microcentrifuge and spin for 5 min at maximum speed to separate\nthe DNA, which will be in the supernatant following centrifugation.\nDay One (Week 10) \u2013 Set-up PCRs\nFollowing DNA extraction we will set-up our PCRs. Remember that we will be using PCR to\ndetermine if the CaMV 35S sequence is present that would indicate that the item has been\ngenetically modified. Each of the four groups will set-up six (6) reactions. Use the following\nnumber scheme to label your tubes. Also be sure to include your initials, the date, and the lab\nsection on the tubes. Make sure you use different pipette tips between samples! Also make\nsure that you do not disturb the InstaGene beads when transferring your DNA. When instructed,\nplace your samples in the thermal cycler and execute the program \u201cGMO.\u201d\nProf. Christopher Blair 97\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Tube Primer Mix (forward, reverse, loading dye) DNA\n1 22 ul Plant Primer Mix 3 ul non-GMO control DNA\n2 22 ul GMO Primer Mix 3 ul non-GMO control DNA\n3 22 ul Plant Primer Mix 3 ul test food DNA\n4 22 ul GMO Primer Mix 3 ul test food DNA\n5 22 ul Plant Primer Mix 3 ul GMO positive control DNA\n6 22 ul GMO Primer Mix 3 ul GMO positive control DNA\nYou will notice that each DNA sample is being amplified twice using two different master mixes,\none plant and one GMO. The plant master mix contains primers that will amplify 455 bp of a\nphotosystem II gene within the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA). Why do we include primers for this\ngene? This helps us to guard against false negative results. For example, we would be fairly\nconfident that a food item did not contain GMO sequences if no bands were detected using the\nGMO primers, but the cpDNA band was detected. Conversely, if no bands were detected with\neither master mix we cannot be entirely confident in our results that the item is non-GMO. The\nlack of bands with both master mixes might be due to a poor DNA extraction.\nLooking at the table, can you provide a reason why we are including non-GMO control\nDNA in the experiment? How does this make the experiment more reliable?\nYou will also notice that our DNA samples contain a GMO positive control. Discuss why\nthis is useful to our experiment. If the GMO positive control yielded no bands with the\nGMO master mix, what might you conclude?\nIn general, why is it useful to include multiple controls when performing molecular\ngenetic experiments? How might this influence the diagnosis of various human\ndiseases?\nProf. Christopher Blair 98\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Day Two (Week 11) \u2013 Gel casting and electrophoresis\nThis week we will be performing gel electrophoresis to determine the banding patterns of your\nfood samples to determine if any are genetically modified. Remember, about 85% of GMOs will\npossess the CaMV 35S sequence, which is ~200 bp in length. The photosystem II cpDNA gene\nis 455 bp.\nGel Casting\n1. See directions above for PTC exercise. Each group\u2019s gel will contain samples\nfrom the PTC exercise AND the GMO exercise!\nGel electrophoresis\n1. Place gel into the electrophoresis chamber. Make sure there is enough 1X TBE\nbuffer to cover to gel.\n2. Load 20 ul of each PCR sample (and 5 ul of the DNA ladder) into the gels following\nthe diagram below. Refer to the table above for tube-sample correspondence.\nTube 1 Tube 2 Tube 3 Tube 4 Tube 5 Tube 6 Ladder Empty\n3. Run gel for 20 min at 120 V.\n4. Visualize results using transilluminator and obtain genotypes.\n5. Use your smartphone to take a picture of your gel.\nProf. Christopher Blair 99\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Day Three (Week 12) \u2013 Lecture, data analysis, and review questions\n1. Draw your group\u2019s banding patterns obtained following gel electrophoresis in the\nimage below.\nTube 1 Tube 2 Tube 3 Tube 4 Tube 5 Tube 6 Ladder Empty\nReview questions:\n1. Why did we include primers to amplify a photosystem II gene in this experiment?\n2. Which foods tested showed signs of GMOs?\n3. Why were 3% gels used in the GMO experiment?\nProf. Christopher Blair 100\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 4. How were you able to determine that a food sample contained GMOs?\n5. Suppose you tested a food item that you knew was genetically modified, but the\nresults of this experiment were negative. How might you explain the results?\n6. Plant cells have how many genomes? What are they? Which genomes were\nexamined in this study?\n7. Why did your instructor recommend that the non-GMO food control sample be\nprepared using the mortar and pestle prior to the test food sample?\n8. What reagents are used in a typical PCR? What is the function of each component?\nProf. Christopher Blair 101\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 9. Explain why DNA ladders are usually included during gel electrophoresis.\n10. One aspect of PCR that can be modified is the annealing temperature. In general,\nhigher annealing temperatures show more specificity towards a single template,\nwhereas lower annealing temperatures show less specificity and may bind to multiple\nregions throughout the genome. Discuss how using an annealing temperature that is\ntoo high or too low might influence the results of a PCR assay (and gel\nelectrophoresis results) such as the one used in this study.\nProf. Christopher Blair 102\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Dr. Christopher Blair\nBIO2450L-Genetics\nLabs 13-14\nIntroduction to DNA Barcoding and Evolutionary Genetics\nBackground:\nFor the next two weeks we will be performing a DNA barcoding exercise followed by a brief\nintroduction to bioinformatics and evolutionary genetics. So what is DNA barcoding exactly? In\nshort, DNA barcoding uses molecular genetic tools to aid in species identification and\ndelimitation. It can also be used to help determine the presence of \u2018cryptic\u2019 species unknown to\nscience. Many times in nature members from two species may look similar morphologically, but\nexhibit significant differences in molecular sequences. Thus, we may say that one of the two\nspecies is cryptic, meaning that we cannot observe differences based on visual examination.\nThe process of DNA barcoding is analogous to a barcode you might find on a grocery store\nitem. When the food barcode is scanned at the register the machine tells you what it is.\nSimilarly, when a DNA sequence is obtained from an unknown specimen it can be compared to\na database to aid in identification.\nDNA barcoding has received tremendous interest over the years as threats to global biodiversity\ncontinue to increase. Several websites are devoted to collecting barcode sequences from all\nspecies on Earth (e.g. http://ibol.org/, http://www.barcodeoflife.org/). For all organisms, partial\nsequences of a single gene are used as a barcode. For most animals the gene commonly used\nis ~650 bp of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI or cox1).\nUnfortunately, this gene is not a useful barcode for other eukaryotes such as plants and fungi.\nFor these groups other genes must be used (nuclear ITS for fungi, chloroplast rbcL and matK\nfor plants). Below is the general procedure used for DNA barcoding.\n1. Obtain fresh tissue samples from specimens of unknown identity.\n2. Extract genomic DNA from tissue samples and use PCR to amplify a barcode region\n(e.g. COI).\n3. Sequence purified PCR amplicons.\n4. Edit raw sequences, and compare cleaned sequences to database to obtain\ntaxonomic identity. A commonly used database is GenBank\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).\nFor this lab we will be performing DNA barcoding on fish samples from your local grocery store,\nfish market, or sushi restaurant. Many times, retailers will mislabel fish to try to market their\nproduct as a more exotic/expensive species. As many fish taste similar, the majority of people\nare unable to discern any difference. It is presently unknown at which stage the fraudulent\nactivities actually occur, although the commonness of the phenomenon is likely having strong\nnegative ecological and economic impacts. DNA barcoding can be used to help determine the\nspecies identity of the fish being consumed. Commonly mislabeled fish include Alaskan/Pacific\ncod, Alaskan/Pacific halibut, salmon, sea bass, red snapper, lemon sole, white tuna,\ngrouper, and walleye (Warner et al. 2013; Arnold et al. 2017).\nProf. Christopher Blair 103\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Lab breakdown:\nWeek 13: Collect fish sample from local vendor, extract DNA, setup PCRs.\nWeek 14: Gel electrophoresis, bioinformatics, and phylogenetic analysis\nWeek 13:\nTissue collection\nEach student is expected to bring in a small sample of fish tissue for the lab. A small square\nsample about the size of a sugar cube is sufficient to obtain high quality DNA. The sample\nshould remain frozen until it is brought to class. Students can wrap the tissue in aluminum foil to\nbring to class. See above for recommendations regarding species to target. Remember which\nspecies the fish was sold as!\nDNA extraction\nWe will use the same sample protocol to isolate DNA from fish tissue as we did to isolate DNA\nfrom cheek cells in the PTC experiment.\n1. Use a sterilized scalpel or other tool to cut a small piece of tissue.\n2. Place cut tissue in 100 \u00b5l of Chelex suspension (10% w/v).\n3. Place microcentrifuge tube with Chelex and cell suspension on 100 \u00b0C heat block for 10\nminutes.\n4. Centrifuge tubes at maximum speed for 5 minutes.\n5. DNA is in the supernatant (avoid beads at bottom).\n6. Store DNA in -20 \u00b0C.\nPCR amplification of ~700 bp of COI\n1. Add 22 \u00b5l of primer mix (forward, reverse and loading dye) to PCR tubes containing PCR\nbeads.\nUniversal fish primers:\n5\u2019-TCA ACC AAC CAC AAA GAC ATT GGC AC -3\u2019 (FishF1)\n5\u2032-TAG ACT TCT GGG TGG CCA AAG AAT CA -3\u2032 (FishR1)\n2. Ensure that the bead is dissolved.\n3. Add 3 \u00b5l of DNA.\n4. Load samples on the thermal cyclers and run the \u201cFISH\u201d program. This program uses\nthe following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00baC for 15 min, 35 cycles of\ndenaturation at 95\u00baC for 30 sec, annealing at 54\u00baC for 30 sec, extension at 72\u00baC for 1\nmin, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00baC for 10 min with samples held indefinitely\nat 4\u00baC. **Make sure to label your PCR tubes clearly and properly!\n5. Store amplified product at -20 \u00b0C until you are ready for the next stage of the\nexperiment. Your lab technician will remove the samples from the thermal cycler when\nProf. Christopher Blair 104\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu finished. He/she will also take an aliquot to ship for sequencing so the results will be\nready during the next lab.\nWeek 14:\nGel casting and electrophoresis\nAlthough your PCR amplicons were already sent for sequencing, we will perform gel\nelectrophoresis on the remaining sample to determine the quality of the PCRs.\n1. Each group of four (4) will prepare a 1% agarose gel.\n2. In a flask, combine 100 ml TBE buffer with 1 g agarose. Gently mix the solution.\n3. Microwave the buffer-agarose mixture at 30 sec intervals, mixing the solution between\nheating. Make sure you wear protective gloves as the flask will be hot! The agarose\nshould be completely dissolved in the buffer and be clear.\n4. Add 10 ul SYBR Safe DNA stain to the hot flask and gently mix.\n5. Place a comb into each gel apparatus. Make sure the comb with 10 wells is placed\nfacing down. Let the hot gel mixture cool a bit before pouring (~3 min). Carefully pour\nthe gel into the gel tray, making sure that no liquid is spilled.\n6. Gels may be placed in the refrigerator to expedite solidification. This should take no\nmore than 20 min.\n7. When adequately solidified, place gel in gel apparatus. Make sure that the wells of the\ngel are near the negative (black) electrode. Fill gel apparatus with 1X TBE buffer.\nChambers should be filled so that buffer adequately covers the gel.\n8. Load the remainder of each sample into the gel. In addition, load 5 ul of the 100 bp\nladder into the first well of each gel. This will help determine if the correct size fragment\nwas obtained (~700 bp).\nSequence analysis\n1. Your instructor will provide you with the DNA sequence data for the entire class. As\nwe did with the PTC data, the first step will be to use FinchTV to edit the raw\nsequences to remove low quality bases. Again, these occur mostly at the beginning\nand end of the reads. However, it is important to manually scan the entire sequence\nto make sure that no base call is ambiguous. As this is a mtDNA gene there should\nbe no heterozygous peaks present. Once your sequences are edited, save them as\nfasta files.\n2. Now that the data are cleaned, we are ready to determine the identity of our fish\nspecies. We will use NCBI\u2019s BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm\nfor this task.\nProf. Christopher Blair 105\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 3. Navigate to the following website\n(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSear\nch&LINK_LOC=blasthome) and paste each sequence into the box near the top (see\nimage below).\n4. Make sure that \u2018nucleotide collection\u2019 is selected under Database and click the\nBLAST button.\n5. Scroll down until you see something resembling the image below. The \u2018Query cover\u2019\nrepresents the proportion of your query sequence covered by the sequence match.\nFor example, 100% of your query sequence aligns with the five samples in the figure\nbelow. The \u2018Ident\u2019 column indicates the sequence similarity between your query\nsequence and the matches. The five sequences below are 100% identical to your\nquery sequence, suggesting that the species is Salmo trutta. Finally, the \u2018E value\u2019\ncolumn represents the number of matches expected simply by random chance (i.e.\nNOT due to homology/shared ancestry). Lower values indicate true matches due to\nhomology.\nProf. Christopher Blair 106\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 6. As we will be performing an evolutionary analysis of our fish sequences, we will need\nto obtain an outgroup sequence to root our phylogenetic tree. Outgroups are\nused to provide direction of evolutionary changes from ancestors to descendants.\nOutgroups should be from taxa closely related to the ingroup, but outside of the\ningroup. Because we are working with fish species, a good outgroup might be from a\nmammal, bird, snake, or lizard. Use BLAST to find and download a homologous\nsequence to be used as an outgroup taxon. Click on an outgroup sequence of\ninterest, which should bring up a page like the one below. This page provides a ton\nof information about the sequence, such as the authors, publication, translation, etc.\nWhen you locate a good outgroup sequence, click the \u2018Send to\u2019 icon on the top right,\nsend to file, and choose FASTA format. This will download the sequence in the same\nformat as our fish sequences.\nProf. Christopher Blair 107\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 7. Next, import all the fish data and the outgroup sequence into Alivew to perform a\nmultiple sequence alignment. Multiple sequence alignments are needed prior to\nevolutionary inference to determine homology among sequences. In essence, we\nneed to make sure we are comparing apples to apples among our different species.\nOnce all the data are imported into Aliview, click Align > realign everything. This will\nuse the popular MUSCLE algorithm to align all your sequences. Once the data are\naligned, export the alignment as a phylip file.\n8. Our final objective is to perform a phylogenetic analysis of our sequences to\ndetermine evolutionary relationships. There are multiple optimality criteria used to\nbuild phylogenetic trees including maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and\nBayesian inference, the latter two of which are considered parametric methods\nbecause they rely on evolutionary models. Before we estimate a tree, we need to\nbecome a little familiar with what evolutionary models are.\nBrief introduction to evolutionary models:\nEvolutionary models are used to model changes in characters states (e.g.\nnucleotides) over the course of evolutionary time. For example, what is the\nprobability of an adenine changing to a thymine versus a cytosine? These\nmodels can be used to estimate phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood\nand Bayesian methods. So what exactly IS an evolutionary model? All\nevolutionary models have two components: base frequencies and nucleotide\nsubstitution rates. The simplest model, the Jukes-Cantor (JC) model, assumes\nthat the four nucleotides occur at the same frequency in the alignment (25%\neach) and that the rate of nucleotide substitution is the same between any pair of\nnucleotides (e.g. A > C = A > T = G >T = C > T and so forth). The Felsenstein 81\n(F81) model is the same as the JC model except it assumes unequal base\nfrequencies (\u03c0 \u2260 \u03c0 \u2260 \u03c0 \u2260 \u03c0 ). The Kimura two parameter model (K2P)\nA C G T\nassumes equal base frequencies (\u03c0 = \u03c0 = \u03c0 = \u03c0 ), but differentiates between\nA C G T\nthe rate of transitions and transversions. Recall that a transition is between a\npurine to purine or between a pyrimidine to pyrimidine. In contrast, transversions\nare between a purine and pyrimidine. The HKY85 model expands the K2P model\nto include unequal base frequencies. The most parameter rich model is the\nGeneral Time Reversible (GTR) model, which assumes unequal base\nfrequencies and different substitution rates between every nucleotide pair. In\ngeneral, more parameter rich models like HKY and GTR are needed for\nalignments with higher levels of polymorphism.\nIn addition to the classes of models discussed above, we can add two additional\nparameters to any model. The first accounts for invariable sites in a multiple\nsequence alignment, which we denote as I. The second parameter, gamma,\ncontrols for evolutionary rate variation across the alignment. For example, some\nregions of the alignment might be highly conserved, whereas other portions show\nmany nucleotide substitutions. The amount of rate variation is controlled by a\nparameter alpha, with small values indicating high levels of rate variation across\nthe alignment. These additional parameters (+I, +G) can be added to any of the\nmodels discussed above (e.g. HKY+I, GTR+I+G, JC+G, etc.).\nIt should be obvious by now that there are many potential models to be used to\nmodel the evolutionary process. So how do researchers know which model to\nuse for a specific alignment? Fortunately, there are software packages available\nProf. Christopher Blair 108\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu that can help select a model objectively. We will not go into model selection in\nfurther detail here as it is beyond the scope of the course.\nNow that we are a little more comfortable with evolutionary models, let\u2019s get back to our\nfish data. We just exported our multiple sequence alignment from Aliview as a phylip file.\nOpen up this file in the program Seaview. Seaview is similar to Aliview in that it can be\nused to align molecular sequences. Seaview can also be used to estimate phylogenetic\ntrees using the \u2018trees\u2019 tab. For this exercise we will estimate a phylogeny of our fish\nspecies using maximum likelihood. Seaview uses the popular PhyML algorithm for\nmaximum likelihood (ML) analysis. Click \u2018trees\u2019 > \u2018PhyML\u2019 to bring up the PhyML options.\nFor the sake of time, we will assume a HKY+I+G model for our analysis. However, in\nactual research one should never arbitrarily select a model. Different models should be\nstatistically tested to determine which fit the data the best. We will also perform a\nbootstrap analysis. Bootstrapping is done to determine confidence in the inferred\nphylogenetic relationships. During bootstrapping, characters in the alignment are\nrandomly sampled x times, where x is the size (in bp) of the original alignment. As\ncharacters are sampled with replacement, some characters may be present multiple\ntimes in a single bootstrap replicate. Usually 100-1000 bootstrap replicates are run to\nassess confidence at nodes of the phylogeny. In general, bootstrap values >70 indicate\nstrong support. Setup your ML analysis using the following settings:\nWhen the analysis is complete you should see a graphical depiction of your phylogeny.\nRe-root the tree using your outgroup sequence and add bootstrap values to the tree.\nExport your phylogeny as a pdf file.\nProf. Christopher Blair 109\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu Review questions\n1. Paste your fish phylogeny in the space below and describe the phylogeny in your own\nwords. Which species are sister taxa? Which are distantly related? Do your inferred\nrelationships appear to agree with current taxonomy? If your samples included multiple\nspecies within a single genus (e.g. Salmo), was the genus monophyletic?\nProf. Christopher Blair 110\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 2. Discuss the utility of DNA barcoding for biodiversity assessment and conservation. How\ndo you think the approach has advanced conservation efforts? How is DNA barcoding\nbetter than traditional morphological identification? What might be some limitations to\nbarcoding?\n3. As stated above, the COI gene is usually not an ideal marker for barcoding plants. Why\nmight this be? What is different between the plant barcoding genes and COI?\n4. In BLAST, what does the E-value indicate?\nProf. Christopher Blair 111\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 5. Why is the GTR+I+G model considered to be the most parameter rich? Describe the\ncomponents of this model.\n6. Why do we need to perform a multiple sequence alignment prior to phylogenetic\ninference?\n7. Can you think of an example of when COI might not be a useful barcoding marker for\nanimals? Explain your reasoning.\n8. Compare and contrast homology, orthology and paralogy with respect to evolutionary\ninference. You may need to refer to your textbook for assistance.\nProf. Christopher Blair 112\ncblair@citytech.cuny.edu 9.
