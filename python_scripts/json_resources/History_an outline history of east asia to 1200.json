The course\ncovers what have become two Chinas, Japan, and two Koreas from roughly 1200\nBC to about AD 1200. As we say every Fall in HILD 10: \u201c2400 years, three countries, ten\nweeks, no problem.\u201d The book does not stand alone: the teacher should assign\nprimary and secondary sources, study questions, dates to be memorized, etc.\nThe maps mostly use the same template to enable students to compare them\none to the next.

It comes from a\nmanuscript on silk that explains particular\ndemons, and gives astronomical and astrological\ninformation. The manuscript was found in a tomb\nfrom the southern mainland state of Chu that\ndates to about 300 BC. I chose it to represent how\nthe three countries of East Asia differ, but share a\ngreat deal and grew up together.

When he died, he was transformed. His breath became\nthe wind and the clouds. His voice became the thunder; his left eye became the\nsun and his right eye became the moon; his arms and legs became the four poles\nor directions and the five parts of his torso became the five sacred mountains; his\nblood and semen became the water and rivers. His muscles and veins became the\nearth\u2019s arteries; his flesh became fields and land. The hair on his head and his\nbeard became the stars. The hairs on his body became plants and trees. His teeth\nand bones became metal and rock. His marrow became pearls and jade. His\nsweat became the streaming rain. And the small lice that ran about his body were\ntouched by the wind and turned into people.\nWe easily see a myth like this as just a story, not literally true. But every nation has myths\nthat seem rational, but are also untrue. As historian Kim Byung-Joon writes, \u201cAll countries are\nprone to harbor a few illusions about their ancient history. They like to assert that their history\nbegan at the earliest date possible, and tend to characterize it as a grand and splendid history,\nuniquely distinct from all others.\u201d1 The United States of America, for instance, presents itself as\nthe land of opportunity and freedom, although its prosperity began with land stolen from Native\nAmericans and labor stolen from African slaves. These myths, like the nations themselves, have\nbeen constructed and elaborated by people over time. They are neither purely imaginary nor\npurely factual. Often they contradict historical knowledge for which there is firm evidence.\nFigure 1.1 A woodblock-printed image of Pan Gu as imagined in the seventeenth century.

Chapter 1, p. 1\nRetrieved from https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9d699767 2\nThe two Chinas, the two Koreas, and Japan all have such myths. Chiang Kaishek, the first\nleader of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and Xi Jinping, the current President of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, agree that Chinese culture has been uninterrupted for more than 5,000 years\nand has been absorbed into the Chinese \u201cbloodline.\u201d But the figure of four or five thousand\nyears is pure invention: made up by a foreign missionary in the late nineteenth century.2 Against\nthe myth of an unbroken, pure Chinese heritage, historian Wang Hui writes, \u201cUnder the surface\nof the idea of China\u2019s unified imperial system, there have always been changes wrought by\ndifferences within and between state organizations, social groups, regions, ethnic groups, and\nreligious faiths\u2026 The so-called pure Han nationality and the image of its imperial culture has\nalways been a fantasy.\u201d3 Because of China\u2019s long written and archaeological records, this\nvariety and change are well-attested. The chapters to come give some examples.\nTangun, the father of the Korean people, supposedly lived around what we call 2333 BC.\nThat was about 2,200 years before the merest scraps of writing extant from the peninsula.\nHistorian Hyung Il Pai judges that \u201cKorean studies that address topics such as the emergence of\nancient Korean civilization, statehood, religion, and identity are inexplicable without reference to\na complex jumble of contradictory narratives filled with Tangun fiction, competing dynastic\nmyths, and hypothetical invasions of tribes, as well as unaccountable archaeological data. This\nstate of confusion has rendered it virtually impossible to distinguish fact from fiction in studies\non ancient Korea.\u201d4 With no way to know whether Tangun existed, we must consider the idea\nthat the Korean people descended from him a myth.\nAs for Japan, myth holds that the imperial family descends in an unbroken bloodline from\nEmperor Jimmu. A descendent of the sun-goddess Amaterasu, Jimmu conquered all the islands\nof the archipelago in about 660 BC. But no-one there had such power at the time: the first sign\nof advanced weaponry in the archaeological records of the archipelago is one bronze arrowhead\nmade after 440 BC. Further, the earliest written records in Japan date from about 1200 years\nafter Jimmu\u2019s supposed expedition. Historian Kitagawa writes that \u201cMost scholars dismiss the\nhistoricity of the official Japanese accounts before the fifteenth emperor, \u014cjin.\u201d \u014cjin lived about\nAD 400.5 There is no real way to know about individuals much further back than that.\nTo test such myths and move beyond them, historians depend on primary sources of\ninformation: texts written close to the events. Primary sources may be preserved \u2013 that is, they\nmay have come down to us on the original medium, be it bone, bronze, stone, silk, bamboo,\nwood, or paper. Created to do specific tasks in their own time, they rarely address our questions\ndirectly, and they may not tell the truth. Primary sources may also have been transmitted \u2013\ncopied from one generation to the next onto different media \u2013 but perhaps with errors or changes.\nHistorians figure out ways to use these imperfect sources. Historians also rely on secondary\nsources, texts by scholars writing later than the events recorded. Secondary sources are most\nvaluable when they cite their primary sources for readers to check, and demonstrate a\ncommitment to the pursuit of truth by reporting the complexities that characterize lived reality.\nThe \u201chistorical\u201d period, and the work of the historian \u2013 \u201chistory proper\u201d \u2013 begin when\nwritten texts survive.* But often, matters people took for granted were not written down, and\n*Note that \u201chistory\u201d can mean either \u201cthe past\u201d or \u201cthe study of the past.\u201d\nChapter 1, p. 2 3\nfew people wrote. So historians draw on other sources of information too, such as \u201cmaterial\nculture\u201d \u2013 objects, buildings. And since historical societies grow from those without writing,\nhistorians need to take prehistoric times into account, often relying on archaeologists.\nFood and Progress\nEast Asia shares its most ancient past experiences with the rest of humanity. By about\n200,000 years ago, homo sapiens sapiens (the species of primate to which all humans now\nbelong) had evolved in Africa. We were almost wiped out about 70,000 years ago by a volcano\nand an ice age, leaving about 2,000 people in all. But we survived. By about 50,000 (or, new\nevidence suggests, even 70,000 years ago6), we had moved out of Africa, and some of us had\ntravelled to Southeast Asia, and then to East Asia. Let\u2019s say a human generation is around 20\nyears \u2013 that\u2019s roughly how long a person lives before having children, in other words. That\nmeans that there have been humans in East Asia for at least 2,500 generations.\nStarting about 10,000 years ago, those people figured out how to make good stone tools, and\nthe Neolithic age (New Stone Age) began.\nMap A. Prehistoric Asian regions referred to in the text. The mainland has the Yellow River and its\ndistinctive hump, the Wei River, and further south the Yangzi (Yangtze) River; the Shandong peninsula\nand early rice-producing settlement of Hemudu, and the current cities of Beijing and Lanzhou for\nreference. East of Shandong is the Korean peninsula. East of that again is the Japanese archipelago.\nChapter 1, p. 3 4\nMost basically, human civilization rests on a steady supply of food. People have assured that\nsupply in various ways, sharing some technology from place to place and developing other\ntechniques independently, so there is no single timeline or progression of civilization. The New\nStone Age included the Agricultural Revolution, which occurred in East Asia about 10,000 years\nago, or 8,000 BC: about the same time as in other parts of the world. Once people had figured\nout how to make better stone tools, they could supplement hunting and gathering food. With\ntheir sharp stone axes they could clear trees and shrubs to create fields; they could burn the fields\nover and with their stone hoes prepare the ground for planting; and with their stone sickles for\nmost grains, and reaping knives for rice, they could harvest efficiently. In the northern mainland\nareas people figured out how to keep and plant millet seeds. They domesticated rice further\nsouth, at Hemudu and along the Yangzi at about the same time. Working with natural wetlands\nwhere rice was native, people also dug ditches to assure water flow. Some time after that, people\ndomesticated dogs (from wolves), then pigs (from wild boar), and then chickens.\nA varied and reliable food supply led to further changes in culture and social organization.\nControl of grain and fields, and investment in wells and ditches, meant that some people settled\ndown in pit houses (pits dug into the earth, walled, and roofed) grouped into stable villages.\nTechniques of growing millet and rice appear in the Korean peninsula in about 2,000 BC,\npresumably imported from the mainland. Another thousand years later people in the Japanese\narchipelago adopted domesticated rice, tutored by people from the peninsula. This path eastward\nfrom the Chinese part of the Asian continent (which I will call \u201cthe mainland\u201d) to the Korean\npeninsula to the Japanese archipelago \u2013 carried many people, ideas, and objects, as we shall see.\nSince grain cultivation started there so much later, it is tempting to think of the peninsula and\narchipelago as being \u201cbehind\u201d the mainland. But what grain offered was a steady food supply.\nAnd long before they grew rice, people on the archipelago had made a plentiful, reliable living\nby gathering acorns, walnuts, and chestnuts in their luxuriant forests and seaweed and fish from\nthe long coastline. Maedun cave in eastern, inland South Korea recently yielded fourteen\nlimestone \u201csinkers,\u201d stones with grooves carved into them so they could be tied to the bottom of\nnets as weights, in order to catch small fish in shallow streams. The sinkers date to 27,000 BC,\nstill in the Old Stone Age (Paleolithic). Nets with sinkers worked very well: archaeologists\nfound fossilized bones belonging to fish and other animals, as well as stone tools and flakes,\ninside the Maedun cave. Fishing hooks made of the shells of sea snails have been found on\nOkinawa (to the south of the main Japanese islands) dating to 23,000 years ago. An excavated\nbuilding from 9,000 BC was so full of salmon bones that archaeologists consider it a processing\nplant that would swing into action at the proper season every year. Once processed, the salmon\nwas stored in pottery jars decorated with snakes and frogs. Rather than a single timeline on\nwhich civilizations are \u201cahead of\u201d or \u201cbehind\u201d each other, people develop and adopt technology\nat different times for complicated reasons.\nCultural Variety\nNot only is there no single line of \u201cprogress\u201d that puts one culture ahead of or behind another,\nbut also, within the areas that now house the modern nations of China, Korea, and Japan,\nprehistoric tribes had a variety of lifeways and ideas. We can draw no straight line from any\nprehistoric culture to any modern nation.\nChapter 1, p. 4 5\nArchaeologists in early twentieth century first conceived of \u201cChinese civilization\u201d as a\nunified and continuous tradition that spread out from a small \u201cnuclear area.\u201d But excavations\ndisproved this view. Instead, archaeology shows that by about 4000 BC, the Neolithic mainland\nhoused many different tribes and villages, falling into six regional cultures, not just one. They\ndid have relations with one another, so the six were said to form an \u201cinteraction sphere.\u201d\nStill, archaeologists looked for the contributions that each local culture made to later\n\u201cChinese culture.\u201d For instance, like later Shang and Zhou people, the Yangshao people living\nalong the Yellow and Wei Rivers, up to around today\u2019s Beijing and west to today\u2019s Lanzhou,\nmade clothing out of hemp and silk, cooked using tripods and steamers, ate millet and offered it\nin rituals, and domesticated pigs and vegetables from the cabbage family. A Yangshao temple of\n3,000 BC has nine clay pots laid out in the shape of the Big Dipper, a constellation that remained\nimportant in mainland astrology and religion. The Dawenkou culture of Shandong had vessels\nshaped exactly like some Shang bronze vessels. The Daxi culture of the middle Yangzi inlaid\nstones in dragon designs. The Xinle culture of Manchuria used jade by 3000 BC. \u2013 Scholars\nhave tended to select such familiar elements out of early cultures and argue that, in archaeologist\nK.C. Chang\u2019s words, \u201cBy 3000 BC, the Chinese interaction sphere can properly and\nappropriately be called China, as it became the stage where Chinese history began to play out,\nwith its clearly defined actors, events, motivations, and story lines.\u201d7\nBut to claim that the interaction sphere was the embryo of Chinese culture, determining its\nfuture shape, scholars have to ignore lifeways that did not continue. For instance, the Hemudu\npeople built their houses up on piles above the ground, and cooked food by suspending it in an\noven, instead of steaming it. The Yangshao people represented shamans as simultaneously male\nand female. Scholars have neglected these facts because they lack clear echoes in later Chinese\ncivilization. That is like throwing out data from lab experiments that contradict a hypothesis.\nTo study the past scientifically means setting aside what we know (or believe) about the end\nof the story. We must look at all the facts we can get, and think about how the past could have\ngone differently, in order to see why it worked out the way it did.\nFig. 1.2 Yangshao pottery jar, c. 2300-2000 BC, depicting cowry shells.

You\nshould recognize the three rivers now. Practice putting information on your own blank maps.\nJewelry, Trade, and Hierarchy\nOne thing clearly links us with the people of the deep past: our love of adornment. The\nsalmon-eating Jomon people of 13,000 BC on the archipelago made earrings of talc stone and\njade pendants, and their imaginative clay figurines of people also wear jewelry. They travelled\nbetween the islands and the peninsula in dugout wooden canoes to trade shell bracelets and hard,\nshiny obsidian (volcanic glass). People everywhere have always treasured jewelry, preferably\nmade of exotic materials that were beautiful and hard to obtain.\nChapter 1, p. 6 7\nIndeed, current theory holds that the Agricultural Revolution was motivated by trade: People\nwanted to settle down in places along natural trade routes, particularly navigable rivers, and they\nwanted to be able to support artisans who could make things to trade for things from elsewhere.\nTrade and travel, fundamental drivers of history, have spread objects and ideas across Eurasia\nand North Africa for 20,000 years. Often, as we shall see, trade objects reinforced or led to\nsocial inequality.\nFigure 1.3 Jomon objects, bone and clay. Net sinker, fishhook, two figurines, two body ornaments, and a\nhairpin. Source: Metropolitan Museum of Art. Public Domain.\nThe trouble with owning nice jewelry, and storing fish or grain to last over the winter, is that\nsomeone can take your things away. By 2000 BC, Neolithic villagers in the Yellow River area\nwere building rammed-earth walls around their villages, some 20 feet high and 30 feet thick. To\ncoordinate defense, some villagers took on leadership roles: social hierarchy appeared.\nChapter 1, p. 7 8\nArchaeologists trace the growth of inequality within communities through burials. In\nYangshao cemeteries, about 4500 BC, people buried each dead person with roughly equal\nquantities of utensils and food. One little girl\u2019s grave in Banpo village contained three well-\npolished balls for playing with. Sacrificial pits ringed the whole area, suggesting that sacrifices\nwere made to the dead as a whole group, for the good of the whole living community. By two\nmillennia later, however, in a Longshan culture cemetery from about 2500 BC, 600 small graves\nwith few or no objects in them clustered around 80 medium-size graves and only six large tombs.\nThe dead in the medium-size graves had wooden coffins, pottery vessels, ornaments of various\nmaterials, and ritual objects (cong tubes and pig mandibles). The large tombs contained whole\nsets of pottery vessels and musical instruments made out of wood, crocodile skin, and copper,\nand their walls were painted with murals. All this means that in the late Stone Age mainland\nsome villagers had more power and prestige than their neighbors.\nLikewise, by 2,000 BC, large towns with massive protective walls built by thousands of\nworkers were made possible by the irrigated rice agriculture of the central Yangzi (Hunan),\nwhere the state of Chu developed. In the peninsula and archipelago, dramatic social\ndifferentiation came later, accompanying the use of metals: bronze technology reached the\npeninsula only in about 700 BC, initially in the form of mirrors and daggers from the mainland;\nand in the archipelago bronze and the later iron technology arrived about the same time, 300 BC.\nMetal came to the peninsula and archipelago from the mainland, like domesticated rice. But that\nwas only the easternmost end of a much longer travel route.\nMetallurgy had reached the mainland from the west, from Persia (Iran and Afghanistan) and\nCentral Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). Sometimes\nthe route is called \u201cthe steppe bridge,\u201d because it crossed the flat plains of Central Asia,\nMongolia, and Manchuria. Sometimes it is called \u201cthe Silk Road(s),\u201d a term invented by\nGerman scholars in the nineteenth century.8 The Silk Roads also connected East Asia with\nSouth Asia (also called \u201cthe subcontinent,\u201d i.e. India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh). Apples and\napricots originated in Central Asia, and many of our foods \u2013 including wheat, millet, oats, grapes,\nalmonds, tea, melons, lentils, dates, pistachios, and peaches \u2013 travelled across the Silk Roads.9\nThe area provided East Asia with luxury items like gold and jewels, and ideas including various\nkinds of technology, religion, and artistic styles, from at least 3000 BC onwards. The steppe\nshaped East Asian history, as we shall see over and over again.\nThree Bronze Age Imports, Maybe Four\nAt the beginning of East Asian history proper, three key imports propelled the Shang people\nto dominance: bronze, domesticated horses, and chariots.\nThe bronze age of the mainland involved more bronze than in any other region in the world,\nbut the technology came from the Middle East. To make bronze, you locate copper ore, separate\nit from other elements, combine it with some tin and/or lead, and either pour it into a mold or\npound it to create weapons, tools, ornaments, and vessels used for sacrificial rituals. (Copper\nmelts at a lower temperature than iron, so humans used it earlier.) We know that bronze\ntechnology travelled westwards across the steppe highway because the earliest bronze found in\nwhat is now China \u2013 a knife of copper alloyed with tin \u2013 was made in around 2800 BC in Gansu,\nin the western mainland (look at the map). Bronze vessels for ritual offerings were made by the\nChapter 1, p. 8 9\nErlitou culture from about 1900 BC to 1600 BC. Burning coal meant that the bronze workshops\nof the Erligang culture, or early Shang, produced even more vessels. Reflecting the technology\u2019s\nimportation from the steppe, Shang bronzes included imported styles, as well. For instance,\nmirrors \u2013 round bronze disks flat and polished on one side \u2013 were made in steppe style until\nabout 650 BC.\nBronze vessels and mirrors evoked awe amongst those who saw them. Bronze swords and\nspears enabled a lineage of kings, or a \u201cdynasty,\u201d\u2020 called Shang, to achieve a loose domination\nover the many different cultural groups along the Yellow River and down to the Yangzi River\nfrom 1554 BC until about 1300. We know that the Erligang culture/ Shang dynasty held some\nkind of pre-eminence among the regional cultures of the interaction sphere partly because,\nalongside their own local pottery styles, these groups had bronze ritual vessels exactly like those\nof the Shang. Then, for a century or so between 1300 and 1200, Shang dominance slackened, as\nthe local cultures imitated their organizational successes; again, we know this because differing\nregional bronze styles appeared. Innovations include huge bronze bells produced by the cultures\nalong the Yangzi, which added music to make ritual more moving and impressive. By this time,\nmainland culture already included elements from the Central Asian steppe and from a variety of\nnorthern and southern peoples.\nAround 1200 BC, the Shang dynasty (1554 \u2013 1046 BC) reasserted its predominance, again\nthrough imports: chariots drawn by horses. In the Middle East, people had invented wheeled\ncarts drawn by oxen by about 4000 BC. By about 1350 (at the time of the Egyptian King\nTutankhamen) they had invented spoked wheels: that made chariots lighter, fast enough for\nwarfare. In about 1200 BC, under King Wu Ding, the Shang began to use chariots for warfare.\nChariots were made of wood with bronze fittings and with spoked wheels. They were covered\nwith lacquer ornamentation. The floors were of wood or sometimes (as also in Egypt) of plaited\nleather to absorb some of the shocks. Chariot technology must have been imported, because\nuntil that time, East Asia had no wheeled vehicles or vehicles pulled by animals. Then, suddenly,\nthe Tutankhamen-style chariots appear in the archaeological record.\u2021\nNo-one had learned to domesticate or ride the wild horses of the northern mainland, which\nwent extinct (as did the native water buffalo of the southern mainland).10 Shang relied first on\noutside equestrian experts, perhaps from Central Asia. The experts brought chariots and\n\u2020 \u201cDynasty\u201d means a royal lineage, in which each ruler passes the throne to a relative by right\nof inheritance. Scholars and others sometimes use \u201cdynasty\u201d to refer to the place-time ruled over\nby a particular lineage. This makes sense insofar as other members of the ruling elite defined\nthemselves by loyal service to that family, but it risks overstating the role of kings and queens in\ndetermining the larger shape of the culture and society of the place-time.\n\u2021 More evidence that the chariot, and the skills to manage its horses, came into China from\nthe Middle East via central Asia comes from historical linguistics. The word for chariot che \u8eca\nwas *klyag and comes from old Iranian, which came from Indo-European *kwel and also led to\nGreek-derived words in English like \u201ccycle,\u201d \u201cwheel,\u201d and \u201cvehicle.\u201d At the same time, Chinese\ninventions and the words for them were going west: silk, old Chinese *sye(g) \u2192 serikos and\nChina was known as the land of the Seres, the silk-makers.\nChapter 1, p. 9 10\ndomesticated horses, and taught Shang people how to rear and manage horses as well as how to\nbuild and fight from chariots. (Horseback riding came from the steppe a couple of centuries\nlater.)11\nArchaeologists have even found people who might have mediated this technology transfer.\nNaturally mummified corpses dating to 2000-500 BC and found in the very dry Turfan area have\nlight-colored or even blonde hair, high noses, pale skins, and full beards. A baby was buried\nwith blue glass placed over its eyes; it may have had blue eyes. Some (about 1000 BC) wore\nplaid. Their descendants may have been Central Asian Tokharians, who spoke a language\nrelated to Celtic and other European languages. The theory is that ancestors of Celts and\nTokharians started somewhere between China and Europe and travelled in both directions. By\n400 BC they were in Ireland, and they may also have taught Shang kings chariot warfare. But\nwait, how would a chariot get all the way from Egypt to North China? Oh. By chariot.\nThe Central Asian experts may also have brought to East Asia the idea for a fourth new\ntechnology: writing. Some Yangshao pottery had incised signs that look a little bit like Shang\ncharacters for \u4e94 five, \u5927 big, \u4e95 water-well, \u65e5sun, and \u7530field, and others. Scholars are still\ndebating whether they gave rise to the full-sentence inscriptions of the reign of the twenty-first\nShang King, Wu Ding, in about 1200 BC.12 Probably Shang scribes did write on materials other\nthan bone, such as silk, but no such writings have survived.\nIt is only with the sentences on the oracle bones that we can begin to do history, adding the\nstudy of texts to knowledge of material culture drawn from archaeology and art history.\nTexts about Antiquity\nUntil the invention of scientific archaeology, knowledge of the deep past came mainly from a\nsmall set of transmitted texts that were copied and recopied and eventually \u2013 beginning after\nabout AD 800 \u2013 printed, and then, in the late 20th century, turned into electronic copies.\nThe most useful transmitted text for understanding antiquity is Sima Qian\u2019s (145-86 BC)\nShiji (Records of the Historian), a history of the known world up to his time. Sima Qian\u2019s\nancestors had been scribes keeping records for rulers, and his father Sima Tan served the Han\ndynasty as an astronomer and archivist. Tan began the Shiji, and his son finished it in about 90\nBC on the basis of research in the Han archives, travel throughout the empire, interviews with\nknowledgeable people, and written records that no longer exist today. The Shiji has five parts:\n\u2022 the Basic Annals of events under each ruler;\n\u2022 tables of genealogy and chronology;\n\u2022 treatises on ritual, music, the calendar, astronomy, transport, and finance;\n\u2022 the \u201cHereditary Houses,\u201d about the feudal states of Zhou times; and\n\u2022 categorized biographies of men and women of all kinds, as well as the earliest\naccounts of Korea and Japan.\nLater dynasties adopted this format, without the \u201cHereditary Houses,\u201d for the official histories\neach compiled about the preceding dynasty. Historians today still rely on Sima\u2019s work, as a\nsecondary source on earlier periods and a primary source on his own.\nChapter 1, p. 10 11\nAlongside the Shiji, readers before the age of archaeology learned about the past from the\nFive Classics. Like the Bible, the Classics were compilations of oral knowledge and written\ntexts of many different ages. They were not completed until Han times \u2013 the same time as Sima\nQian\u2019s Shiji \u2013 but they were widely believed to be much older. People across East Asia both\nread and memorized them. They form the core of the shared literary and governing heritage of\nthe East Asian countries, sometimes called the Sinitic tradition.\n\u2022 The Book of Odes includes 305 poems of all kinds, orally composed and written\ndown from about 1000 BC to 400 BC.\n\u2022 The Book of Documents or Classic of History includes genuinely old speeches from\nabout 1045 BC along with three other chronological layers of text, the last set written\nas late as AD 400.\n\u2022 Three books on ritual took shape only in the Han period. When we count \u201cFive\nClassics\u201d we count them as one.\n\u2022 The Book of Changes is an extremely strange guide to divining the future (or\nunderstanding the present). The oldest part of it may go back to around 1000 BC,\nwith additions going up through about 100 BC.\n\u2022 Finally, the Spring and Autumn Annals of the state of Lu, itself very dull, acquired\ncommentaries that include good stories of the politics of 722 BC to 481 BC.\nIn addition to the Classics, the writings of the philosophers of the Hundred Schools of Thought\n(about 550 BC to 139 BC) also commented on the deep past, and form part of the shared East\nAsian heritage of poetic, political, and cosmic writing and techniques of government. Together,\nthese provide a considerable body of written knowledge about the Zhou dynasty (1045 \u2013 256 BC)\nand some about the Shang.\nWas There a Xia Dynasty?\nBut since these texts were written down after the Shang period, how we can assess their\nclaim that a dynasty existed even before Shang, called Xia?\nThe Classics and philosophers discuss an antique golden age of three dynasties: Xia, Shang,\nand Zhou. Golden-age governance \u2013 they say \u2013 began with Yao, a virtuous ruler who chose a\nfilial man called Shun to replace him; Shun likewise chose Yu. When Yu died, this meritocratic\nsuccession ended, for Yu\u2019s son founded the Xia dynasty and the whole tradition of inheritance of\nthe throne. East Asians for centuries, reading the Classics and philosophers, believed that the Xia\nkings had ruled for 400 years, declining in virtue until the first king of the Shang dynasty\noverthrew the wicked last Xia king.\nBut in the early twentieth century, Chinese scholars studying the Classics from a linguistic\nperspective began to doubt the very existence of Xia and Shang. Gu Jiegang and others could\nsee that the Classics had been written down starting at least five hundred years after the end of\nXia and beginning of Shang. Outside of the transmitted texts, there was no independent\nevidence for the first two dynastic regimes.\nVery shortly after the emergence of the \u201cdoubting antiquity school,\u201d however, archaeology\nprovided evidence of Shang \u2013 its bronze vessels, oracle bones, building foundations, and tombs.\nArchaeologist found more and more ancient material during the twentieth century, and\nChapter 1, p. 11 12\nColumbia University historian and archaeologist Li Feng has argued recently that when we put\ntransmitted texts, preserved texts, and the archaeological record together, it makes sense to\nequate the Xia dynasty with the Erlitou culture (c. 1900 \u2013 1600 BC, mentioned above). It falls at\nthe right time, in the right place.\nThe Erlitou culture had bronze weapons and vessels, demonstrating wealth and organization.\nTheir state organization (institutions of government) could not have been as highly developed as\nthe transmitted legends of Yao, Shun and Yu claim, but earlier sources do talk about about a\nfigure called \u201cGreat Yu\u201d and his work on flood control, including a bronze vessel that may be\nauthentically from about 900 BC. 13 Sima Qian\u2019s Shiji and a text from two centuries earlier both\nrecount a complete lineage of 16 kings of the Xia dynasty, beginning with Yu and ending with\nJie, who was overthrown by the Shang. Since Erlitou left no texts, we will probably never know\nfor sure whether they called themselves Xia or what their kings said and did. But Li Feng\nsuggests that if historians neither accept the transmitted sources wholesale nor reject them\nentirely, but combine them with archaeological knowledge, we can accept that Zhou speeches\nand poems mentioning Xia (see Chapter Two) were referring to a memory of the Erlitou culture.\nFigure 1.4 Shang bronze personal ornaments.

Public Domain.\nThe Shang Period (1554-1045 BC)\nThe early twentieth century doubters of antiquity had no archaeological evidence of the\nShang dynasty: so they were right to doubt. But as it happened, in 1899 some people in north\nChina dug up a cache of bones, all stuck together in a clump of mud; when soaked and washed,\nthey turned out to have what looked like writing on them, although in a form that no-one could\nread. An antique dealer snapped them up and sold them to a couple of scholars who collected\ninscriptions on bronze and stone. Scholars like Wang Guowei began to match the characters to\nmodern ones, and realized that the bone inscriptions were indeed preserved texts from the Shang\nperiod.14 Divining the future by means of heating animal bones (pyro-scapulimancy) had been\npracticed in Mongolia and Siberia from about 3500 BC onwards, and in the archipelago from\nChapter 1, p. 12 13\nabout 300 BC (where deer, boar, and dolphin bones were used). Shang divination using \u201coracle\nbones\u201d fell squarely in this tradition, but they added something.\nThe Shang innovation in pyro-scapulimancy was to record the oral questions about the future,\nand sometimes the outcomes, in writing on some bones. Bone were inscribed after the ceremony.\nApproximately 73,000 inscribed bones and shells have been excavated, and many more with no\nwords. Once scholars recognized the characters on the oracle bones as the ancestors of those in\nChinese, Japanese, and Korean writing systems, archaeologists began to dig. They found sites\nthat included not only troves of oracle bones, but also royal tombs, walls, and buildings, and\nbeautiful bronze vessels. All testified to a high level of skill and organization, and a great\ncommand of resources. Just when the doubters had cast a shadow on it, the Shang sprang back\nto life.\nSince Shang written records are still limited, our picture of Shang society relies heavily on\narchaeology, as well as on reasonable inferences drawn from comparisons with other Bronze-\nAge cultures.\nThe first Shang king, we know from the Shiji and the oracle bones, established the dynasty in\n1554 BC. Twenty-two generations of kings followed, with the throne often passing from elder to\na younger brother, then back to the elder brother\u2019s son. (Why does that make good sense?) The\nShang dynasty controlled only a small area in the northern mainland. Like the early Yamato\nkings we will meet later, they moved fairly frequently, and archaeologists are still finding new\nShang cities. The last capital was Anyang. Its palaces and houses for the elite; ancestral temples;\nworkshops for making bronze vessels and weapons, chariots, jade, and other things; pit dwellings\nfor workers; and villages where farmers lived covered about 9 square miles (slightly smaller than\nBerkeley, CA) \u2013 tiny, but 45 times larger than any other East Asian settlement of its time.15\nFrom Anyang, the Shang king travelled a great deal, for up to six or seven months out of the\nyear. He traveled up to 200 miles away, but usually only about 125 miles away, and by late in\nthe period normally only a dozen miles from Anyang. The diameter of his sphere of travel\nrepresented the area of his most direct control: a network of small settlements spread over an\narea about one-third the size of California, but with far fewer people, and more trees and animals.\nThe Shang drew materials from much further away, as far as the Yangzi delta and Sichuan. But\nin no way did Shang constitute a territorial state with firm boundaries; its warriors dominated the\nmore than 30 other groups around them through an unstable mix of war, trade, raiding, and\nalliance. The southern groups below the Huai River remained quite different from and\nindependent from Shang, adopting bronze for their own styles of bells, ritual vessels, and\nweapons. Even the closer network of towns and villages that shared more aspects of Shang\nculture were not necessarily under its control. There was already some specialized regional\nproduction: Shang ale may have come from Taixi, 125 miles away.16\nHistorians routinely consider the Shang the first historical Chinese dynasty (since Xia had no\nwriting). But their brother-to-brother succession and loose control over a small area were only\ntwo of the ways in which they differed dramatically from the later major dynasties and their\nstates. We\u2019ll get to the human sacrifice in a minute, but first let\u2019s consider the structure of Shang\nsociety.\nChapter 1, p. 13 14\nShang State and Society\nOne thing Shang shared with many later periods \u2013 almost all covered in this textbook \u2013\nShang society and state were both aristocratic. Society refers to the organized collectivity of all\npeople in a certain place-time; in an aristocratic society almost all people remain in the social\nstratum, or rank, into which they are born. There is little social mobility up or down the social\nscale. People\u2019s proper roles and life possibilities are largely determined by their family\u2019s rank,\nin combination with their gender and place within the family. The upper ranks of the social\nhierarchy, the \u201cnobility\u201d (confusingly also called \u201cthe aristocracy\u201d) openly say, write, and\nbelieve that they are intrinsically, essentially better than others because of the families into which\nthey were born. In particular, noblemen across the world insisted on their own superiority not\nonly to poor, low-ranking people (whom they hardly considered worth talking about or to) but\nalso, and especially, to wealthy, low-ranking people. Wealth may attend rank in an aristocratic\nsociety, but in itself it does not grant high social standing. (Wealth \u2013 the ownership of the\nmeans of production \u2013 determines class, not rank.) People of lower ranks may or may not have\nagreed with nobles about who was better; but few sources tell us what they thought.\nThe state is the imagined entity that holds the right to control people and territory. It does\nthat through changing government institutions that manage society and its resources, and in an\naristocratic state political power exercised through government is inherited by families. Got it?\nThe aristocratic state \u2013 really a proto-state, not as organized as later regimes \u2013 of Shang was,\nfurther, a monarchy. It centered on the king (wang \u738b). The king had a retinue of hundreds of\npeople, the nobility or aristocracy, collectively called the zhong \u8846. (This word changed its\nmeaning over time.) The nobility comprised clans (patrilineal descent groups) called zu \u65cf.\nThey were closely linked to the king. Oracle bone inscriptions record that the king reported to\nhis ancestors on the noble clans\u2019 activities, asked whether they would be lost in battle, and\noffered sacrifices to assure that his royal ancestors would protect them. The nobility, or\naristocracy, made up his court and his support, often travelling with him.\nAs well as the king\u2019s own clan, there were those of his uncles and cousins; those that\nprovided the king with consorts (royal wives); clans of diviners; and clans who managed the\nShang farms and mines and other resources. Each noble clan had its special skills \u2013 mining,\nfarming, weaving, making pottery, jewelry, rope, fences, etc. \u2013 in which its children were trained,\nto provide those skills to the kings, generation after generation. Archaeologists have found\npeople of the same surname, indicating a craft, buried in cemeteries together. Although only\nroyal oracle bones were inscribed with texts, both other members of the elite and ordinary people\ncontinued to practice bone divination.17\nSocially beneath the noble clans, with no special ties to the king and no political power, were\nthe ren \u4eba : ordinary people. They did the hard work of all kinds under the direction of the clans,\nand their lives were fairly grim. They might live on a clan estate, or in an isolated village amidst\nthe forest. They were not slaves, because they were called up for work, usually in winter, in\ngroups of a thousand or three thousand, and then sent back home to their farming, which relied\nChapter 1, p. 14 15\non Neolithic-style tools of wood with blades of stone, bone, or clam shells. A few bronze spades\nand pickaxes have been found, but the king did not waste bronze on farmers, nor ask his\nancestors about their welfare in the oracle bones.\nFig 1.5 Two vessels from about 1300-1100 BC. Left: bronze, about 9 inches tall. Right: earthenware,\nabout 8\u201d. Why do they have three legs? How was their ornamentation done? Can you guess at their\ncontexts of use? Metropolitan Museum of Art. www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/ Public Domain.\nLet\u2019s map these three social groups \u2013 the royal family, the other aristocratic clans, and the\nordinary people \u2013 onto the landscape. Anyang, the king\u2019s capital, was surrounded by fields\ncultivated from spring to autumn to feed the royal family. Not far away, the noble clans had\ntheir own estates, the fields cultivated by their people. Beyond and between them was a\nhinterland of more isolated settlements under lesser Shang chiefs, with fields around them. All\nthe dwellings and fields were set in lots of forest. Beyond the core area centered on Anyang\nwere the settlements of the unrelated chiefs with whom Shang alternately allied and fought.\nViolence and Ritual\nShang wealth and power stemmed from violence. Historian and archaeologist Li Feng calls\nthe Shang regime \u201chegemonic\u201d rather than \u201clegitimate,\u201d because it relied on violence or the\nthreat of violence. In other words, the king had no ideology that could bind the other groups to\nhim voluntarily and for a long time \u2013 no set of ideas that justified his dominance. 18 (For that is\nhow ideology is defined in this book: as ideas that legitimate power.) All Shang activities\ninvolved force.\nFor defense the Shang had walls of pounded earth. That meant that workers had to dig out\nhuge quantities of soil with shovels of stone and wood; carry it to the site; cut down trees with\nstone axes to make planks to hold the earth in place; and pound it down, layer after layer, inside\nthe plank forms. Pounded-earth walls are so hard that they can be excavated today, clearly\ndifferent from the soil around them. Building the four-mile long wall encircling Zhengzhou in\nChapter 1, p. 15 16\nabout 1450 BC, one archaeologist estimated, took 10,000 laborers twelve and a half years.\nSomeone with a sharp weapon was overseeing them.\nFig 1.5 Shang bronze axe, c. 1200 BC, with taotie mask on blade and inlaid pattern on haft. Can you\nfigure out how the wooden handle was attached? Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nWith their bronze weapons and chariots, the elite (the king and the nobles) spent much of\ntheir time in raiding the little villages and in wars against the other communities. The largest\nShang armies numbered 3,000 to 5,000 men, but these were not well-organized armies with clear\nhierarchical control. Rather, each aristocrat had his or her own chariot and his own warriors\nsurrounding the chariot, fed form his or her own estate. If a noble thought a battle was going\npoorly, s/he might withdraw. When Shang warriors defeated others in war, or simply raided\ntheir territories, new scholarship on the isotopes in bones suggests that captives were brought\ninto Anyang and its suburbs as slaves. They were worked as hard as possible on a meager\nvegetarian diet, until they either died naturally or were sacrificed.\nHunting used the same bronze weapons. Nobles and their soldiers chased deer and wild boar;\nand of course even ordinary people could hunt birds and rabbits with wood and stone as they had\nbeen doing since long before the Agricultural Revolution. Occasionally the hunt encountered\nleopards, tigers, elephants, and rhinoceros. Big hunts also used fire to encircle animals; the fires\nhelped destroy forest and open new fields for farming. Most meals were stews of boiled millet\n(a grain with smaller seeds than wheat) with a few vegetables and maybe a bit of meat thrown in.\n(People ate twice a day, at about 9-10 in the morning and 4-5 in the afternoon.) People also\nmade millet into ale. Ale was safer to drink than plain water, because fermentation kills germs.\nAle also enhances sociability (when drunk in moderation), so it played a central role in the\nshared clan sacrifices to royal ancestors on which Shang aristocrats lavished time and resources.\nChapter 1, p. 16 17\nThe resources spent on rituals to ancestors included an average of 65 human sacrifices a year.\nHuman sacrifices accompanied another ritual activity that has left traces: funerals. Long before a\nking died, he ordered construction of his tomb to begin. When he died, a hundred or more people\nwere killed with and for him \u2013 some as noble \u201caccompaniers in death,\u201d each with his own burial\ngoods and human sacrifices, and some war captives, slaughtered without honor. Looters found\nnearly all of the tombs long ago, but the intact tomb of one queen, Lady Hao or Fu Hao, yielded\nto archaeologists an amazing wealth of grave goods, including steppe-style bronze mirrors,\nweapons, earrings, and large numbers of bronze ritual vessels. The royal tombs were deeply\nburied, meant never to be disturbed. The funeral may have been political theatre demonstrating\nthe wealth and power of the deceased king or his successor, but a belief that the ancestor needed\nthose things and people in the afterlife must also have motivated the lavish tomb goods.\nOracle Bone Divination\nOfferings to the ancestors went along with asking for their advice and help. These\ndivination rituals guided every Shang royal action and required a lot of work. Historian David\nKeightley roughly calculated the number of hours of labor that went into one set of five turtle\nplastrons that were used to figure out King Wu Ding\u2019s military strategy for one season, and then\nre-used ten days later to ascertain who was causing his toothache.\nThe work shows both how powerful Shang kings were, and how much they worried about\nconsulting their ancestors. To get the bones, required raising oxen (cattle had come to the\nYellow River Valley from the Middle East in about 2,300 BC), and turtles caught or farmed and\ntransported to Anyang, from as far south as the Yangzi River. The bones or plastrons had to be\ncleaned of flesh, dried, and polished (10 hours of labor). It took 80 hours to drill hollows in them\nin preparation for heat-cracking. If producing each crack with a torch during the ceremony took\nonly one minute (which seems too fast), then the cracks on the set of bones Keightley studied\nwould have taken two full hours to make. After the divination ritual was over, it would have\ntaken five hours to carve and color the inscriptions. So, this one plastron set cost at least 100\nhours of labor. On average, Shang royalty used at least one shell or ox shoulder bone every day.\nKeightley estimates that at least fifty hours of work per day went into preparing for, doing, and\nrecording royal bone divinations during the last century and a half of the Shang period.\nRoutine divinations occurred every other day. In order to keep track of the ancestors and not\nleave anyone out, the Shang developed a system of \u201cten heavenly stems and twelve earthly\nbranches\u201d \u2013 which combined into sixty pairs. (The same pairs later counted hours, months, and\nyears, as well. The 1911 revolution is called \u201cthe Xinhai Revolution,\u201d because it occurred in a\nxinhai year.) Unscheduled divinations asked the ancestors about military campaigns, illness,\nchildbirth, the harvest, and other concerns. Diviners kept their exact process secret, Li Feng has\nconcluded: for the approximately 2,500 divinations done for a prince (zi \u5b50) south of Anyang,\nwith the same ancestors as the King, have quite a different style.19 That suggests that the king\nreally was consulting ancestors about decisions. He was not just doing ritual theatre, nor was he\nperforming for any public wider than very close family members.\nChapter 1, p. 17 18\nFig. 1.6 Oracle Bone Fragments.

Public Domain.\nFor us to read the inscriptions on oracle bones also requires a lot of scholarly work. After\nscribes wrote the questions on the bones, Shang people buried them. Since the early twentieth\ncentury, archaeologists have been excavating them, and universities and museums collecting\nthem. Specialists clean them and fit broken fragments together. Scholars make rubbings so that\nthey can copy and study the glyphs on the bones. Slowly, they have figured out how the glyphs\nrelate to modern Chinese characters; slowly they have figured out the grammar and translated the\ninscriptions into modern Chinese, Japanese, English, and other languages. These translations are\ncollected and published, and scholars use them to understand Shang society, along with other\narchaeological evidence.\nIn this process, as in all historical intellectual work, scholars made decisions about how to\nunderstand the data. With more evidence and different questions, later scholars may revise that\nknowledge. An assumption is an idea that has not yet been proven but that scholars accept; a\nhypothesis is an idea that someone proposes and tests against the evidence. For instance, the\nChapter 1, p. 18 19\nShang bones include a figure called \u201cdi.\u201d On the bones, di looks like this: 20 Scholars\nfigured out that this is the word that came to be written \u5e1d and pronounced in Mandarin \u201cdi\u201d\n(fourth tone). Scholars knew that later, in the Zhou period, there was a top god and that this\nword was one way to refer to it. They capitalized \u201cDi\u201d in English to express the assumption that\ndi was a single, top god in Shang times as in Zhou. But characters, old or new, cannot be\ncapitalized and there is no way to distinguish between plural and singular in the inscriptions.\nHistorian Robert Eno questioned the assumption that \u201cdi\u201d in Shang times referred to one\nbeing. He noticed that everywhere the term occurs on the oracle bones, it could refer to a group\nof beings, based on the context. He hypothesized that it referred to a group of royal ancestors,\nnot a fixed group, but whichever ancestors the worshippers were discussing at the time. He\nfound additional evidence for this hypothesis in the inscriptions:\nDi commands natural forces, but no chain of command.\nDi\u2019s powers are like ancestral powers.\nAncestors received scheduled sacrifices. Di did not.\nDi appears in parallel with other plurals.\nDi is added to some ancestors\u2019 names.21\nWe have no reason to think that Shang had a high god. Recognizing this makes the Zhou\nchallenge in Chapter Two easier to understand.\nThe Shang royal family thought of their ancestors as powerful, able to help or harm their\ndescendants. More: it seems likely that although other aristocratic clans worshipped their own\nancestors, they agreed that the Shang royal ancestors held great power. To openly challenge a\nroyal family that had lasted 500 years, through twenty-three generations, would take courage and\na strong coalition. Like the bronze and chariots that had strengthened Shang, both the courage\nand the persuasive argument needed to put together such a coalition came from Central Asia, as\nthe next chapter will explain.\nSources: This chapter relies on The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins\nof Civilization to 221 BC, edited by Michael Loewe and Edward L.

The structure of the Zhou\nmonarchical, aristocratic state was feudal, which permitted great expansion outwards and across\nranks, and the absorption of many lifeways into Zhou culture. Like the Shang elite, Zhou\naristocrats defined themselves by war, sacrificial ritual, and hunting. But they also moved\nbeyond violence to invent ideology and history. They wrote the poetry and prose, debated the\nphilosophical ideas, and created the ways to govern that formed the foundation of East Asian\ncivilization: the Sinitic tradition.\nA Violent Transition\nIn the twelfth century BC, the Zhou people were one of the communities whom Shang\nalternately allied with and fought against. The later thinker Mencius called them \u201cwestern\nbarbarians.\u201d They seem to have moved several times, and according to later written records, in\nabout 1125, a leader named Danfu settled the Zhou people in the Wei River Valley to the west of\nShang at a place called Zhouyuan (see Map C). His son Jili died in a battle against Shang in\n1099, and Shang also captured Jili\u2019s son Chang. When they released him, they gave him some\nbronze vessels, and entrusted him with guarding their western flank against a Central Asian\ngroup called the Qiang (who spoke languages related to Tibetan): very dangerous enemies who\noften appear in the oracle bones as human sacrifices.\nAs allies in the loose Shang political order, Chang and the Zhou people began to take on\nmany aspects of the impressive Shang elite culture. They adopted \u4e9e ya-shaped Shang-style\ntombs, and Shang-style sets of bronze vessels. They used and eventually began to bury chariots\nas the Shang did. They made buildings of pounded earth, but they added tile roofs: a big\nimprovement over wood or thatch. They did turtle-shell divinations \u2013 using a different shape of\npre-drilled hollow from Shang \u2013 and began writing in Shang characters, but very small and in a\ncareless style, with a different syntax. Turtle shell divination fragments excavated 30 miles west\nof today\u2019s Xi\u2019an record that Chang sacrificed to the Shang royal ancestors, including recently\ndead kings; and the Shang king visited the Zhou homeland. So both sides worked to maintain\nthe alliance.\nBut Chang was ambitious. Taking on these Shang forms of culture made sense as a\npolitical strategy to increase his prestige and power among his own people and the other groups\nin that area. The Shang had developed an impressive rulership culture and had dominated others\nfor hundreds of years. The things they made and the rituals they did, by this time, in themselves\ncarried authority: they both symbolized and created power. In order to increase his own power,\nChang took on those symbols. Zhou men also married or claimed to have married women from\nthe Shang and even Xia royal families, to enhance their own legitimacy. In 1056, Chang\nrenounced the alliance, took the title \u201cKing Wen,\u201d and renewed Zhou attacks on Shang. Zhou\nmilitary power rested on an alliance of a number of different tribes from the mountains and\nChapter 2, p. 1 22\nvalleys around them. King Wen and other Zhou leaders had to work extremely hard to maintain\ntheir coalition, as we know from the speeches recorded in the Book of Documents.\nMap C: Regions, peoples, and sites mentioned in the text, including present-day Xi\u2019an city for reference.\nThe conquest of Shang was bloody and difficult. In about 1053 King Wen\u2019s armies were\ndirectly threatening Anyang when he died. His son King Wu (Martial or Military King)\nmourned his father for three years, and then set out on a campaign eastward in the 12th month of\nChapter 2, p. 2 23\n1046 BC. He arrived at the outskirts of Anyang in the first month of 1045, and there he and all\nthe allied tribes of western mountains and valleys fought all the armies of the tribes and clans\nliving on the eastern plains, the Shang and their allies. The battle on the field of Muye lasted for\nan entire day and into the night. Muye was a vicious battle: so many people were wounded and\nkilled that stone pestles \u2013 which are very heavy items \u2013 were washed away in the blood (we are\ntold). Once King Wu had defeated the Shang, Zhou leaders celebrated by killing about a\nhundred Shang aristocrats whom they had taken prisoner.\nHow do we know that the battle of Muye occurred in 1045 BC? Transmitted primary\nsources list the Xia, Shang, and Zhou kings in order; Sima Qian\u2019s Shi ji put all but one of the\nShang kings in the correct order, as the oracle bones \u2013 which he did not have \u2013 confirm. But no-\none knew exactly how long each early Zhou king had reigned until, in 1976, archaeologists\nexcavated a group of Zhou bronze vessels with long inscriptions that together provided a\ncomplete relative chronology of the Zhou kings. Then all that was needed to know the absolute\ndates of each king was a starting point. Astronomers can calculate when events such as lunar and\nsolar eclipses and planetary conjunctions occurred in the past, and like all ancient people the\nShang and Zhou observed such events closely, and recorded some. By coordinating the relative\nroyal chronology with astronomical events, historian David Nivison set the Zhou conquest at\n1045.1 Particularly useful was the report in the transmitted sources that in the 41st year of the\nreign of King Wen, \u201cThe Five Planets gathered in [the constellation] Room.\u201d This refers to a\nsyzygy: all five visible planets lined up. In this case, the line pointed down towards a gap in the\nhills where the Zhou were settled.\nAs well as providing a definite date for the Zhou conquest, the syzygy also answers the\nquestions: How did King Wen and King Wu come by the courage to take on those powerful\nShang ancestors? How did they convince the allies to join them in a confederation against Shang?\nThe courage came from their faith in a new god, imported from Central Asia: Heaven (Tian \u5929).\nThis sky god was no-one\u2019s ancestor. The Zhou also claimed divine ancestors, but each tribe had\nits own ancestors. Heaven, by contrast, was for all peoples \u2013 like the sun, moon, and stars. Zhou\nheard about this god from their neighbors further west. When all the planets lined up, for the\nfirst time in over 500 years, dramatically pointing right down at the Zhou homeland, it must have\nseemed as if the sky god was sending a message \u2013 an order: Heaven\u2019s Mandate.\n(Later propagandists and historians further developed this \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d ideology,\nand used it to legitimate dynasties and explain their rise and fall. Heaven selects a virtuous man\nto rule the world. As long as his descendants are personally virtuous and attend to ritual; listen to\nwise advisors; and assure the people secure lives and livelihoods, they will hold the throne with\nthe approval of Heaven. But if a ruler becomes wicked, heedless, and extravagant, Heaven will\nfirst warn him with signs like earthquakes, comets and droughts, and eventually choose a new\nvirtuous leader. Invented to justify the rebellion of the Zhou against the Shang, this ideology\nfaded in Zhou times, was revived in the middle of the Han period, and lasted until at least 1911.)\nWith a new sense of mission, the Zhou leaders also had a powerful way to convince\nothers to join in a full-scale attack on Shang. Everyone could see the sign in the sky. Before and\nafter the conquest, Zhou leaders made speeches and songs hammering home the idea that a\nHeaven, a deity above all ancestors, supported them. They argued that when Xia became wicked,\nChapter 2, p. 3 24\nHeaven mandated Shang to conquer and replace it; and when Shang became wicked, Heaven\nchose Zhou. Eventually scribes incorporated the speeches into the Book of Documents, and the\nsongs into the Book of Poetry. Whereas Shang power had rested on organized violence, Zhou\nadded ideology \u2013 ideas that justify power. Over the years, with repetition, the propaganda story\nof Heaven\u2019s support for the Zhou helped whitewash the bloody conquest. The Feudal State\nImmediately after the victory at Muye, King Wu established an eastern capital at Luoyi\nas well as maintaining his homeland capital in the Wei valley, to better control that area. He\nestablished a temporary occupation regime by putting two of his brothers in charge near the\nShang capital. Leaving some Shang descendants alive, he assigned them to a domain to the east\nto continue offerings to their ancestors. When King Wu died, his son Cheng was 16, and his\nuncle, the Duke of Zhou, served as \u201cregent,\u201d ruling until King Cheng could take command. The\nremnant Shang and two other Zhou uncles rebelled almost immediately, and it may be that the\nprocess of chasing down the rebels took Zhou forces further than planned, offering a new\nconception of what was possible. For Zhou designed a system to control more territory more\nclosely than Shang had dreamed of. We know a good deal about it, because in addition to the\ntransmitted sources in the Classics, museums hold 12,000 excavated Zhou bronze ritual vessels,\nmany with inscriptions saying who made them, why, and when. (Clans of scribes that had\nserved Shang still served the Zhou in composing and calligraphing documents and inscriptions.)\nWe call the Zhou monarchical state, or overarching government structure, \u201cfeudal\u201d in\nEnglish, translating fengjian \u5c01\u5efa, even though it differed greatly from the much later European\nfeudal system. In Chinese Communist discourse, \u201cfeudal\u201d refers to the whole period from Zhou\nthrough the end of Qing in 1911. That is not useful for historians: to call everything \u201cfeudal\u201d\nignores the dramatic difference between the Zhou system and the imperial, bureaucratic system\nimposed by Qin in 221 BC (next chapter). The basic structure of the feudal system was that that\nZhou king assigned relatives and allies to lands (domains or feoffs/fiefs) both inside and outside\nthe area of his capital in the Wei River valley. Inner enfeoffment was called feng and distant\nenfeoffment was called jian.\nFirst, inner grants of feng lands and serfs rewarded noblemen serving at court. An\ninscription on a bronze vessel cast in 981 BC records, for instance, that a royal officer named Yu,\ngrandson of a man who had served the Zhou founders, had just been appointed to an important\nmilitary office. The inscription quotes from the king\u2019s order to Yu, which would have been\nrecorded more fully with ink on bamboo strips. King Kang said to Yu:\nI award you a vessel of sacrificial wine, a hat, a cloak, a pair of knee pads,\nslippers, and a horse and chariot. I award you the flag of your late grandfather,\nthe Lord of the Nan clan, to use in hunting. I award you four Elders (local clan\nheads) from the Zhou domains along with 659 serfs ranging from charioteers to\ncommon men. I award you thirteen Elders of foreign origin who are royal\nservants, along with 1,050 serfs.\nThe king paid Yu (like others) with prestige objects and real wealth in land and labor, which Yu\ncould pass down to his descendants and share with his own followers. Yu served the King well:\nChapter 2, p. 4 25\nMap D.

The trouble\nwith this system of rewards was that by giving away lands, the king diminished his own holdings.\nChapter 2, p. 5 26\nSometimes he took away feng from one family to give it to another, causing conflict in the royal\ndomain.\nFigure 2.1 An inscription cast into a bronze vessel. Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nSecond, grants of outer jian domains expanded the Zhou sphere of control as a whole, but\nover long centuries they, too, reduced the Zhou king\u2019s power, as we will see below. The Zhou\nleadership set up jian domains centered on armed and manned settlements all over North China,\nfar beyond the former reach of Shang control. They carefully planned out the garrisons in threes,\nso that Zhou lords could support one another as they conquered and held territory extending\ncontrol eastward from the Wei valley homeland. Garrisons were placed along routes that were\neasy for military marches and the transport of goods, but also in the best places for long-term\nagricultural settlement: close enough to rivers for a water supply, but not so close that flooding\nwould be a problem. The settlements with their warriors were nodes in a network supporting one\nanother; they relied on the conquered villagers in the countryside around them for work and food,\nbut these hinterlands stretched out only a little way from the garrisons at first, with lots of\nunfarmed land and people not yet under Zhou control around them, and certainly no clear\nborders between them. The garrisons did not even have walls.\nFeudalism meant that although there was just one king, he shared his authority. Li Feng\ncalls the Zhou system a \u201csettlement-based state with delegation\u201d to kin and allies. The Duke of\nZhou, regent for King Cheng, enfeoffed sixteen of his brothers descended from King Wen, four\nof his nephews descended from King Wu, six of his own sons (one son represented him in his\nown fief of Lu, so that he could stay by King Cheng\u2019s side), and a number of men related to the\nroyal clan by marriage, especially from the Jiang clan. (In any aristocratic system, even if\ndescent is calculated through the father\u2019s family (patrilineally), the mother\u2019s family matters for\nrank, prestige, and power.) Authority was really shared, for the lord of a domain could run it as\nhe liked, unless the king specifically forbade him to do something. He owed the King some\ntribute, and military support in far-ranging campaigns, but he received military support from\nChapter 2, p. 6 27\nothers in return, as well as prestige objects like bronze vessels. And he passed his domain on to\nhis son or sons, although theoretically the king could take it back. Fiefs were hereditary and\nlargely independent in day-to-day matters. (Remember that: bureaucracy will change it.)\nBy 1030 BC, 15 years after the conquest, the major domains were in place. Their borders\nwere not as clear as lines on a map: they overlapped, and there were spaces amongst them not in\nZhou control, but there were no more major challenges. Another generation later, by about 1000\nBC, the peripheral boundary around all 60-70 Zhou domains was secure, and further expansion\ntook place, carried out by both the domains themselves and by their armies at the command of\nthe Zhou king back in his capital. Zhou expanded westwards into the lower Ordos region (the\nbump under the Yellow River) \u2013 there are Zhou tombs as far west as Ningxia \u2013 and eastwards to\ninclude the whole Shandong peninsula. Zhou tombs include many beads of carnelian and\nfaience from India and Central Asia, but those came from trade, not conquest: the Zhou\nsuccessfully fought their way down to the Middle Yangzi area, but King Zhao was defeated and\nkilled there by the southern state of Chu, losing nearly half of the Zhou\u2019s military force.\nThat defeat came in 950 BC. It allowed non-Zhou people in the west to increase attacks\non the western capital, and moreover led various branches of the royal family to contend for the\nthrone. The challenge to Zhou unity came not only from King Zhao\u2019s failure, but also as a\nnatural result of success. For the first few generations, a century or so, the feudal lords had been\nfew and closely related. The small size of early Zhou bronze vessels, and the large number used\nto heat wine (as well as others for food) suggest that the royal family was still relatively small\nand close, practicing emotionally intense rituals in which the king and his family communicated\nwith the ancestors with the help of wine and sacrifice. But after four or five generations, there\nwere too many sons and cousins for close rituals, and competition for resources heated up.\nFigure 2.2 Short sword and sheath with crouching feline at the top of the handle, 10th \u2013 8th century BC,\nnortheast China.

Public Domain.\nThe Zhou Aristocracy\nThe Zhou leadership responded with reforms to keep the elite together and loyal to the\nking, even when he no longer regularly met them face to face. Based on the styles of Zhou\nChapter 2, p. 7 28\nbronze vessels, archaeologist Jessica Rawson thinks the reform occurred between about 950 and\n850 BC, while Li Feng places it later, when the Zhou had disintegrated further.2 Instead of\ngiving all sons and cousins equal status as before, the ritual reform distinguished \u201ctrunk\u201d (senior)\nand \u201cbranch\u201d (junior) patrilines. The eldest son by the primary wife \u2013 probably from the highest-\nranked family \u2013 headed the trunk lineage and retained the father\u2019s status.\nYounger sons had a critical role to play. They maintained their lineage\u2019s ties to the Zhou\nking, because they could serve at the royal court, while the eldest son inherited rulership and\nritual duties to ancestors in the fief itself.3 But despite their important role, in terms of rank,\nyounger brothers were relegated to heading \u201cbranch\u201d lineages, slipping down one notch in the\nhierarchy, until after five generations younger sons were only low-ranking officers or \u201cknights\u201d\n(shi). The younger sons of the knights might still bear arms and participate in the Six Arts of\nZhou \u2013 rites, music, archery, charioteering, composition (mainly oral until about 400), and\ncalculation \u2013 but they were no longer officially ranked as aristocrats.\nViolence was still fundamental. The aristocracy defined membership by kinship and by\nparticipation in war, hunting, and bloody sacrifice to ancestors.4 Each rank had its ritual\nprivileges in family worship and in burial. The senior line at each level worshipped the lineage\nfounder on behalf of all, and the trunk ancestors five generations back. Each branch worshipped\nonly its ancestors going five generations back. Other ancestors received offerings as a group, so\nthey were still fed.\nChapter 2, p. 8 29\nFig. 2.3 Ritual bronze altar table and thirteen ritual vessels, c. 1000 BC. Reportedly excavated from a\nWestern Zhou aristocratic tomb in Shaanxi province. Notice that the vessels were not created as a\nperfectly matched set. Can you figure out what each might have been used for, food or wine? Source:\nMetropolitan Museum. www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/ Public Domain.\nGrand burials for the higher Zhou ranks continued. In the Zeng domain, for instance, 106\ntombs have been found, the grand ones along the ridge, and others on the hillside. The site\nincludes two pits with complete chariots and many horses. Burying horses and chariots \u2013 the\nmachines of war \u2013 showed that the descendent had enough and to spare: he was a power to be\nreckoned with. Likewise, Marquis Qi of Zeng was buried with 25 bronze vessels.5 Human\nbeings were still sacrificed to accompany lords in death, too \u2013 sometimes buried alive.6 Such\nfunerary display of prestige goods shored up power based on heredity and violence.\nEconomically, each elite lineage had its own estate with serfs who worked as servants,\nfarmers, artisans, and shepherds. Estates and royal workshops might specialize in certain types\nof goods: leather, for instance, or chariots, jade ornaments, or tiles. Such goods, and small\nparcels of land and serfs were not sold, because there were no markets, nor was there any money\n(cowrie shells, used as money elsewhere in the world, were exchanged for display but did not\noperate as coins). But goods and lands could be exchanged. Since the king still nominally\nowned all land, property rights were unclear, so when lands were exchanged conflicts easily\narose. Zhou farmers had tools of stone, bone, and shell; to irrigate fields they could divert small\nstreams. They grew soybeans and millet, a little wheat and rice. Millet was made into ale. As\nwell as silk for the ruling class they made hemp cloth for themselves. The ruling class ate pigs,\nchickens, and dogs, and sacrificed oxen and sheep (and ate the sacrifices in feasts). Scholars\nChapter 2, p. 9 30\ndisagree about whether most farm labor was done collectively, under overseers, or by clans of\nserfs \u2013 probably it varied \u2013 and about exactly what kind of relation the working people I have\nbeen calling \u201cserfs\u201d (bondmen? slaves?) had with their lords. They certainly were not free\npeople, however, even when they were highly skilled artisans.7\nIn addition to the titles of the feudal lords themselves, within the aristocracy and noble\nfamilies, there were many, many ranks. Older sons and daughters outranked younger ones;\nprimary wives outranked secondary wives (also called concubines); members of the senior\nbranch of a family outranked the junior branches; old people outranked young people. All these\nfactors intersected in any given relationship between two people to produce a highly complex\ninternal ranking system \u2013 as in any aristocracy. Rules of etiquette that were part of ritual\ngoverned these relations; the classics speak of \u201cthree hundred major and three thousand minor\nrules of ritual.\u201d The rules disciplined aristocrats to create ruling class coherence, reinforcing\ntheir sense of themselves as inherently better than the people they dominated. As a form of\norganization, the rules of rank also contributed to ideology.\nFig. 2.4 Knife-spoon, first half of the 1st millennium BC (1000 BC \u2013 500 BC), northeast China. Why do\nyou think this is harder to date than other bronze objects? Metropolitan Museum of Art. Public domain.\nZhou state and society were both highly aristocratic: most people were born into their\nplace in life; and political power lay in the hands of a tiny elite. Serfs worked the estates of the\nelite, whose sense of superiority was supported by their possessions, their rituals, and their kin\nconnections. Fed by many farmers, fishermen, and herders with wood and stone tools, this was a\nworld dominated by noble men and women who inherited status, political power, and wealth.\nDid Kija Move Eastwards to Found Old Chos\u014fn?\nThose aristocrats did not necessarily stay put, however. The Book of Documents\npreserves a long lecture that marks one of the starting points of Korean history. The last Shang\nking had several advisors who tried to correct his alleged wickedness; one was Prince Ji (Jizi), or\nKija in Korean. Kija left the area after the Zhou conquest and later returned to lecture the Zhou\nking, giving him \u201cThe Great Plan\u201d for governance. A thousand years after the conquest, Chinese\ntexts include stories that when Kija left Zhou, he established or was enfeoffed in a domain in the\nLiaodong peninsula or southern Manchuria, founding a dynasty there, called Chos\u014fn.8 The last\nKorean dynasty, established in A.D. 1392, named itself Chos\u014fn and identified even more with\nKija, and some prominent families claimed descent from him in the late nineteenth century. But\ndid Kija really establish a state called Chos\u014fn? Did he move to Manchuria? Did he even exist?\nChapter 2, p. 10 31\nJust as Chinese scholars began to doubt the existence of the Xia and Shang in the early\ntwentieth century, Korean scholars started to question the transmitted records about Kija in the\nBook of History and later accounts. They found that by AD 1100, the Kory\u014f dynasty had\nestablished official Kija worship, probably for reasons similar to the Zhou adoption of Heaven,\nthat is, to justify its attempt to conquer Manchuria. Kory\u014f looked back to the glorious Kogury\u014f,\nwhose people were said to have worshipped Kija in about AD 500 \u2013 but the first report of that\ncomes from four centuries later. Korean doubters of antiquity proposed that perhaps Kija had\nbeen enfeoffed elsewhere in Zhou, and that then the Qin and Han regimes invented the story of\nhis eastern migration to justify their attacks on southern Manchuria.\nHistorian Jae-hoon Shim has recently argued that the preserved records \u2013 oracle bones\nand bronze vessel inscriptions that the early twentieth century scholars did not have \u2013 show that\nKija indeed existed, really did ally with Shang, and moved somewhere eastward with his people\nin the early Zhou. But he had no relationship to \u201cChos\u014fn,\u201d which appears in texts only from\nabout 400 BC, as a tribe northwest of the Liaodong peninsula. Han-period scholars invented the\nlegend that the Prince Ji went east and founded Kija Chos\u014fn; some peninsula+ regimes adopted\nit to legitimate military campaigns; and Korean scholars in about AD 1000 avidly adopted it to\nclaim a close connection with the great tradition of the Classics and Confucians. But there is no\nevidence of a \u201cKija Chos\u014fn\u201d that gave birth to the Korean nation. Rather, the Manchurian area\nincluded different groups of people for a long time. 9 It greatly affected East Asian history.\nZhou Expansion\nOver the centuries, Zhou elite culture extended to more people in three different ways.\nFirst, each domain\u2019s lord began to extend control into more of the hinterland, the area\nsurrounding the garrison town. Some local leaders held on for a long time: tiny Zhulou, later\ncalled Zou, continued to fight annexation by Lu right up to about 400, even as its leaders\nintermarried with Zhou clans. Once Zhou control in an area had been secured, the feudal lords\nand the aristocratic families below them, each with its own estate, organized serfs to clear the\nwilderness for agricultural development. Iron (discussed below) sped up those developments,\nspreading gradually from about 600 BC. The feudal lords in their feoffs built roads, canals, and\nwalled towns, defeating and absorbing the remaining independent villages and tribes of hunter-\ngatherers, turning them into farmers and townsmen. Local people adopted Zhou culture:\nclothing styles, and the ritual patterns of funerals and weddings, spread slowly, as the\narchaeological record shows. For instance, near the domain of Yan in the area of Beijing was a\ndistinctive culture called Xiajiadian in eastern Inner Mongolia and western Liaoning, which kept\nits own style of curved dagger and horse-fittings right up into the fourth century BC.10 For their\npart, the Zhou elite picked up folk songs (recorded in the Odes), and perhaps other local lifeways.\nSecond, the melting pot of developing Zhou culture was enriched by expansion outward\nto other pre-existing polities. To the south lay the large states of Chu, Wu, and Yue, whose\nrulers did not originate with the Zhou house or its early allies. As they joined the Zhou cultural\nand political sphere, the southern areas brought their own contributions. They had been growing\nrice, domesticating chickens and water buffalo, and travelling along the seacoasts and even to the\nIndian ocean since at least 5000 BC. Chu artisans played with the bronze form, adding different\nChapter 2, p. 11 32\nkinds of animals, but also developed fabulous, decorated lacquerware and paintings on silk. Chu\nalso contributed a different style of poetry; a work called Li Sao (On Encountering Sorrow)\nrecords the poet\u2019s encounters with spiritual beings, leading scholars to connect it with\nshamanism. Even after Chu adopted (and further developed) state organization and writing in\nChinese characters, it took pride in its southern heritage and culture.\nFig. 2.5 Wing\u00e9d lacquer cup from the state of Chu, third century BC, probably part of a matched set of\nvessels.

Public Domain.\nA third kind of Zhou expansion came through an arithmetic process. Because noblemen\ncould marry more than one consort (both wives and concubines of nobles are \u201cconsorts\u201d) and\nfeed more children than commoners, more and more people were descended from the Zhou elite\nand educated in the Six Arts. Even the younger brothers who no longer ranked as aristocrats, but\nwere mere \u201cknights\u201d shi or commoners, still had a sense that they were Zhou people, and they\nspread and developed Zhou culture.\nRelations with Other Peoples\nBut did that mean that they thought of people to the north as \u201cbarbarians\u201d? Textbooks\nand historians use this English term to translate many different words in Chinese, which has the\neffect of naturalizing the supposed ethnic unity of \u201cthe Chinese\u201d as distinct from \u201cbarbarians.\u201d\nAs the feudal lords built up their domains and swallowed up their neighbors, they began to call\ntheir domains \u201cstates,\u201d and as a group, the \u201ccentral states\u201d \u4e2d\u570b. Those states managed political\nrivalries and alliances within a very mixed, multi-ethnic world.\nChapter 2, p. 12 33\nThe northern Di and western Rong groups, for starters, lived over a wide area in northern\nShanxi, Shaanxi and Hebei, normally scattered but sometimes allying with one another (see Map\nD). Some Zhou texts, including the Zuo Commentary, say they are like animals, or wolves, and\nunlike the \u201cXia\u201d people \u2013 the Zhou states. But each case of rhetoric about Di or Rong sub-\nhumanity occurs in a particular political conflict between Zhou domains with Di or Rong as\nallies of one side. Just as diplomats made speeches referring to kinship among the states in order\nto achieve some alliance or other aim, so they also talked about the wolvish characteristics of the\nnon-Xia groups. In fact, they described Zhou domains in the same way at times. People with\ndifferent lifeways were identified as foreign, but their interactions with the Zhou domains \u2013 now\nbecoming independent states \u2013 did not occur along clear Us vs. Them lines.11\nChapter 2, p. 13 34\nRather, relations on the northern frontier were pragmatic. Defense and survival on the\none hand, and aggressive expansion on the other, both required ever more resources as the\nwarfare among the Zhou states ramped up. Zhou states took three practical approaches to\nnorthern groups. First, where possible, you should conquer the non-Zhou to expand and enslave\nthem. Second, if that would be too expensive or dangerous, or if you need allies, make peace\nwith them. Third, if you are able, incorporate them into the administrative structure of your state,\nin order to effectively use them for fiscal and military purposes \u2013 just as you do other people.\nWhen a state chose one or another approach, they couched it in moral terms for publicity, but\nthat does not mean the choices were made for moral principled reasons.\nIn 770 the Rong people attacked the western Zhou capital and forced the Zhou king to\nmove east, but Zhou states continued to ally with the Rong and Di groups as often as they fought\nwith them. For instance, in 721 BC the state of Lu (where Confucius lived two centuries later)\nmade a covenant with Rong. Such treaties, when made among Zhou states, typically specified\nending fighting, being good neighbors, helping each other, and allying against a common enemy.\nTreaties were made with the Rong or Di on the same terms and through the same diplomatic and\nritual steps that governed Zhou states\u2019 relations with one another: negotiations in visits to each\nother\u2019s courts, with gifts, followed by ratification in a ceremony in which blood covenants were\nmade. The blood covenant as reconstructed by Mark Edward Lewis involved the participants\npurifying themselves through fasting while workers erected an altar and dug a pit. A sheep\nwould be sacrificed in the pit, its ear cut off and placed in a vessel, and the blood caught in\nanother vessel for the participants to drink (yum!).\nThe alliances with Di and Rong were real, and even oaths between Zhou states were\nbroken, in the realpolitik context of competition among Zhou states against for resources \u2013\nfarmers, soldiers, land. Then end result, by 500, was the full integration of Di and Rong people\nas military forces into Zhou states. Having eliminated the buffer zone, the Zhou states found\nthemselves facing the much more formidable mounted Northern Zone nomads.\nNomadism had developed on the Central Asian steppe around 1500 BC, about the same\ntime as the Shang got their start. They lived by nomadic pastoralism, a method of production in\nwhich people moved herds of animals through the landscape as the seasons changed, seeking\npasture. The society and culture of nomads diverged from those of agricultural people as the two\nmodes of production diverged from their shared prehistoric roots: domestication of grain and\nsmall animals. In about 1000 BC, people learned to ride horses. By about 900 BC, nomadism\nhad migrated from the steppe highway east to Manchuria: archaeologists have found large\nnumbers of buried horses, horse fittings, and weapons. Instead of the immensely heavy bronze\nvessels of the agricultural zone, the warriors who formed the steppe elite marked their status with\nportable art in the shape of animals and elaborate horse-gear. From about 600-300 BC,\nconcurrent with the Warring States period, the steppe culture of warriors who dominated herders\nand farmers spread all along the northern frontier of the Zhou states, developing local cultures\nthat interacted with each other and to some extent with the Zhou states.\nConnections, direct or indirect, through travel and trade, stretched far to the west, as\nalways, as this amazing find shows:\nChapter 2, p. 14 35\nLeather armor made in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which encompassed parts of present-day Iraq, Iran,\nSyria, Turkey, and Egypt, and carbon-14 dated to between 786 BC and 543 BC by scholars at the\nUniversity of Zurich was excavated from the tomb of a 30-year-old man in the very dry area of Turfan, in\nthe northwest of China today. Small leather scales were stitched only a back, protecting the soldier\u2019s\ntorso without adding the weight of metal armor. This was a time-consuming and thus costly process.\nFair Use. https://phys.org/news/2021-12-year-old-leather-armor-technology-antiquity.html.\nThe \u201cHegemon\u201d System of the Spring and Autumn Period (771-476 BC)\nBig changes set in after the Rong attack forced the Zhou king to move to his eastern\ncapital in 771 BC, but not mainly because of that attack. Rather, the basic dynamic was that\ndomains along the outer Zhou periphery had more resources. As they grew, their independence\nfrom the King increased, and they began to attack and take over other Zhou domains, now states.\nThose who were stuck in amongst their brethren were vulnerable to attacks from all sides, and\ncould not expand as easily into new territory. New territory meant a domain could exploit new\nnatural resources and the labor of populations not already under Zhou control.\nThe first powerful state was Qi, located in northwestern Shandong. From Bohai Bay it\ndrew fish, and produced large amounts of salt (archaeologists have discovered salt-production\nsites there going back to Shang times). Salt is a valuable commodity because everyone needs it\nto live, especially if they do not eat much meat. Qi also produced a purple dye made from shells\nthat was used for prestige garments. Qi annexed two smaller states and controlled the whole\npeninsula, so that the groups who had been known as \u201cEastern Barbarians\u201d (dong yi) were now\ntheir subjects. Qi could feed large armies, large enough to rescue its neighbor to the north, Yan,\nfrom a Di attack in 664; and large groups of workmen, large enough to build a line of fortresses\nChapter 2, p. 15 36\nalong the south bank of the Yellow River all the way from its debouchment into Bohai to the\nroyal capital at Luoyang, in order to defend the \u201cCentral States\u201d from future northern attacks.\nBecause of these contributions, Duke Huan of Qi won a declaration from all the other\nZhou domains that he was \u201chegemon\u201d (ba): not the king, but the legitimate protector of the king,\nwhom others should follow. The other major states, whose battles with one another hurt the\nsmall states as well, were also along the periphery of Zhou: Jin to the north of the Zhou royal\ndomain, Chu to the south, and eventually Qin to the west.\nLater ideologues suggested that kingship was legitimate, and the hegemon was not. The\nstatus of the hegemon was, indeed, not the same as that of the king; it was based on military\npower rather than descent, and changed hands accordingly. Nevertheless, the hegemon\u2019s status\nwas institutionalized, and the covenants and ritual involved conferred legitimacy on the hegemon.\nThe system represents a creative attempt to shore up the Zhou order and prevent all-out warfare.\nThe conferences that designated hegemons included broader principles of managing\nruling-class interactions. The five ranks of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron were\nsystematized to regulate how much tribute the hegemon could claim from states of different sizes.\nThe conferences also established family rules \u2013 which made sense since Zhou power was\njustified by kinship, and peace was made through personal alliances. For instance, the first\nconference agreed that a concubine, or secondary wife, could not be elevated to the status of\nprimary wife, in order to diminish factional conflicts at their courts.12 After all, if a wife sent to\nsolidify an alliance between two states was displaced by a woman from a different state, the\nalliance would fall apart. The hegemon system, with both organization and ideology, recognized\nthe need for new institutions that would continue the feudal states, with the Zhou king as\nfigurehead. It proved a failure, but it is still part of history.\nIn fact, if iron technology had not been imported from Central Asia, the hegemon system\nmight well have succeeded. The Central States (zhong guo, now used to mean \u201cChina\u201d) might\nhave wound up looking more like medieval Europe: a large number of states with inter-related\nmonarchies, and some shared high culture, but with different local languages and lifeways. The\nnext chapter will talk about why iron mattered, but let\u2019s look one more time at bronze.\nRitual Changes in the Spring and Autumn Period\nSince ritual was so central to political life, changes in relations of the Zhou feudal lords\nwere echoed in and affected by the ritual realm. Around 600, ancestral ritual among the\naristocracy changed from an intimate family rite to something more like a performance. There\nwere musical changes: group singing was replaced by loud bell music played by performers. In\naddition, aristocrats adopted rituals that were inappropriate to their hereditary status, in order to\nshow off and increase their power that way. In other ways, too, political ambition was on display.\nFeudal lords collected not just display objects, but people who could entertain or advise them,\nincluding, by the third century BC, large entourages of scholars.13 Tombs of great lords, instead\nof being underground, were built up into high, imposing layered towers. Instead of the ranked\naristocracy being closely connected with one another, over time the rulers of some big states\nChapter 2, p. 16 37\nwere exalted far above the rest of the nobles in their states \u2013 their relatives. The gap between the\nlords and everyone else became enormous.\nAt the same time, ancestral ritual focused more on the living and less on the ancestral\nspirits. The feudal lords had bronze ritual vessels made bigger, with more dramatic designs\nappropriate for viewing from afar, which suggests larger audiences. Here are key changes:\nWestern Zhou, before about 600 BC Eastern Zhou, after about 600 BC\nSmaller bronze vessels Larger vessels\nMore delicate decoration More dramatic decoration\nFocus of the ritual is ancestors: offering wine, Focus of the ritual \u2013 sometimes explicitly \u2013\nhonor, and food in exchange for blessings. is the living community.\nInscriptions say the vessel is for use in Inscriptions say the vessel is for the use of\nsacrifices to a specific ancestor (dedicatee). the donor who commissioned the vessel.\n\u201cStatement of past merit\u201d section is excerpted \u201cStatement of past merit\u201d section recites a\nfrom official documents of the service to the list of glorious ancestors to show them off \u2013\nking or other patron that earned the donor the to others.\nright to cast the vessel.\nAs shared ritual tended toward performance, the lower-ranking members of aristocratic\nfamilies were relegated to the back of the room. There they developed a critical habit of mind,\nhistorian Edward Shaughnessy has argued. While early hymns in the Book of Odes praised the\nZhou rulers and feudal lords, later poems also criticize lords. Poets developed ways to observe\nthe complex interactions of animals and plants in the natural world and used such images to\ndisplay their observations of the complex emotions and relationships of the human world. Such\ncritiques brought new salience to the individual intellectual\u2019s mind, and those thinking people\nobserved ritual more clearly. From the back of the room, those doing ritual looked more like\nactors than worshippers.\nInsincerity became thinkable. Whereas the Shang King\u2019s duties had been external \u2013 he\nhad to read bones, kill the calf, spill bones, etc. \u2013 there were now the beginnings of a concern\nwith the mindset of the ritual practitioner.14 Divisions among the elite created a new kind of\nindividual consciousness, an explicit focus on interior sincerity as well as exterior performance.\nChapter 2, p. 17 38\nFigure 2.6 Cast-bronze bell, fifth to third century BC. Bells were made in sets that played different pitches.\nThis one is two feet high. Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nConfucius\nInto this world was born the first of the philosophers. Confucius or Kong Qiu (551-479\nBC) was born in tiny Zhulou, a few miles south of Qufu, the capital of the domain of Lu. Lu\nalready controlled Zhulou by that time, but for another thousand years, until the sixth century\nAD, sources call it a non-Zhou, \u201cbarbarian\u201d (Yi \u5937) culture.15 Confucius had to learn Zhou ritual\nas an outsider, but when he did, he loved it, and lamented its decay. He thought that elite\nfamilies should follow the old rules about who could properly make offerings to which spirits\nand how, as well as the old aristocratic etiquette of daily interactions. After all, ritual expressed\nthe divinely-appointed human hierarchy of the Zhou system! (We have seen already that ritual\nchanged over time.) But as Confucius aged, he made a different argument: that rituals had to be\nbased in sincere human emotion. This focus on sincerity meant both that some change in ritual\nwas acceptable, and that rituals expressed and shaped human emotion, rather than being\nprimarily ways to manipulate the spirit world. A man who strove for both sincerity and\ncorrectness in ritual would cultivate his own moral nature and thus his spiritual power.\n(Confucius says very little about women and had no female students.)\nChapter 2, p. 18 39\nThe life of Confucius has been imagined in many ways. Sima Qian\u2019s Shiji has the first\nbiography, presenting a man who made his difficult life harder by being a know-it-all who fairly\nconsistently alienated people in power. According to Sima, Confucius was the illegitimate child\nof an elderly lower-level official in Lu, who learned who his father was only when his mother\ndied. He spared no expense to bury his mother with his father, asserting his claim to be a low-\nranking aristocrat \u2013 a shi \u58eb \u2013 as his father had been. He managed to learn a lot about ritual,\ngathered some students, and got hired by one of the so-called \u201cThree Families,\u201d ministerial\nfamilies just about to usurp the power of the Duke of Lu, inventorying grain in the granary of the\nJi clan and then managing their sheep and cows. For long years he travelled around to the\nneighboring states, seeking influence with both legitimate and illegitimate rulers \u2013over the\nobjections of his disciples to the latter. He was fired as often as he was hired.\nConfucius\u2019s success in office came sometimes came from knowing all kinds of odd facts\nabout the past; sometimes from his knowledge of ritual, still important to Zhou aristocrats (or\nthey would not have bothered to abuse it); sometimes from hard-headed diplomacy; and\nsometimes from policies that benefited the economy and brought order. At the age of 56, he\nbecame a local \u2018justice of the peace\u2019 in his home state, executed one of the usurpers, and began\nto turn Lu into an honest and thriving community. He was foiled on the brink of success by the\nrich and powerful neighboring state of Qi, which sent gifts of eighty beautiful girls and one\nhundred beautiful horses to the Duke of Lu. The gifts successfully distracted the entire court\nwith sex and hunting, and Confucius quit in disgust. He retired for eight years to edit the Five\nClassics \u2013 says Sima Qian. In old age, Confucius acquired a little humility, learning to consult\nwith his disciples and listen to others. He learned to care less about what others thought of him\nand to be at ease in just doing and teaching what he thought was right.16\nSima\u2019s Confucius was not an extraordinary person who perfectly embodied learning and\nmorality from day one. He was a flawed mortal of relatively lowly status (like Sima Qian himself)\nwho made plenty of mistakes of judgment and even of ethics, but who learned from his mistakes\nand from other people. He slowly cut and polished his own character, and taught others.\nThe Hundred Schools\nConfucius and his disciples opened the door to theorizing in rational and ethical terms\nabout governing and individual roles. Until about the time of Confucius, very few people even\namong aristocrats \u2013 mainly the scribal clans \u2013 were literate, and \u201ctexts\u201d were transmitted orally.\nThat is why the Analects records pieces of conversations, not extended considerations of\ncomplex philosophical questions. Later schools of thought produced longer essays. As they\nparlayed the new ease of writing into longer and more complex arguments, all later thinkers had\nto agree or disagree with Confucius (or both); they could not just ignore Confucian thought.\nAlthough stories and sayings moved from one school of thought to another, shared by various\ntexts, we know that Confucius came first because while other texts argue with him, he does not\nargue with them, and never mentions very important intellectual topics \u2013 such as physical self-\ncultivation \u2013 that arose after his lifetime.17\nThe \u201cHundred Schools\u201d \u2013 meaning \u201cschools of thought\u201d or communities of like-minded\nthinkers \u2013 center on various \u201cmasters.\u201d Conventionally, we talk as if the different schools of\nChapter 2, p. 19 40\nthought were born dogmatically divided. But in the ancient intellectual world, as people freely\ndebated a wide variety of questions, all schools drew on old texts, like the speeches of the early\nZhou rulers and other texts that were being (at the same time) gathered into the Classics, and on\nstories of sage-kings and other mythical and historical figures. If one debater came up with a\npithy anecdote, someone else would borrow it, perhaps to make a different point. The thinkers\nalso shared knowledge of ritual and present-day politics, and their debates both drew on the\ndistant past (real, imagined, or falsified) and were directed at current power struggles and\nconditions. We have only a fraction of what they wrote down, although new texts are being\nexcavated, and still less of what they said.\nWe conventionally attribute the writings of the Hundred Schools to single teachers or\nauthors, like Confucius, Mencius, and Laozi. But like the Classics, they were composed or\ncompiled by numerous people. As one historian explains, \u201cIt has long been recognized the most\nof the received classical texts from ancient China are composite texts that were built up in layers\nover decades or centuries, passing through the hands of numerous copyists, compilers, and\neditors, some of whom also fulfilled the role of pseudo-authors.\u201d18 Each began as a collection of\nsayings or conversations or thoughts, put together by a group of people discussing and debating.\nThen someone who wanted to finalize the text and close the conversation would invent an author\n(perhaps using the real name of a teacher), and tell of his death or departure. But often that did\nnot succeed in finalizing the text, because the community was still thinking and talking. More\nstories would arise about the author, and they, along with more sayings and thoughts, might be\nincorporated into later versions of the text. This means that the author and the text were co-\ncreated by a community of thinkers, even if there was an actual teacher or author who started\nthings off. Rather than the intentions of one person, the text reflects the shared understanding\n(including disagreements) of the group of like-minded people talking to (and about) each other,\nover time.19 The Classics and even the Analects did not take final form until the Han period. We\ncontinue to treat each text as written by or about one central figure as a convenience.\nThe various schools of thought share the idea that a loyal minister is one who keeps\nreminding his lord of his flaws, preferring honesty that supports the long-term well-being of the\nstate to flattery that supports the current lord\u2019s ego.20 Confucius\u2019s disciple Mencius, in particular,\ncomes across as unafraid to speak truth to power. Mencius also argued against another thinker,\nMozi (c. 480-390), who explicitly opposed Confucians in several ways. First, Confucius had\nurged the nobles not to skimp on the rituals appropriate to their station, to carry them out fully;\nbut he also criticized those who demanded too much grain from their subjects. Mozi pointed out\nthat all the money spent on ritual came from the working people, so that these two aims were\ncontrary. Funeral rituals and other kinds of ceremonies were just a waste, he thought; they\nshould be cut back or ended. Second, the Confucians saw familial love as the foundation of\nmorality. It was natural and right that a son should love his parents more than someone else\u2019s\nparents, and by nourishing that feeling through ritual he could extend his concern to other\npeople\u2019s parents. Mozi saw family love as selfish: we should love everyone alike, not favoring\nour own children or parents. Finally, Confucius focused on the ethical development of the\nindividual, and so each of his 70 or so disciples carried on his teachings in different veins,\nthinking for themselves. Mozi, on the other hand, did not value individuals. What mattered was\nthe material good of society: peace, high population, plenty to eat.\nChapter 2, p. 20 41\nFig. 2.7 A book written on bamboo strips, dating to the Warring States Period and held at the Shanghai\nMuseum. The strips would have been tied together with a cord wrapping around each strip and its\nneighbor. In other cases, strips had holes punched at the top (or top and bottom) and were threaded\ntogether that way. The book is a Confucian discussion of the Book of Odes. Even if you can read Chinese\ncharacters, this might be hard for you! You can find what it says at the source:\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Manuscript_from_Shanghai_Museum_1.jpg Public Domain.\nMozi was so committed to his message that he once walked for ten days and nights to\nstop a war, binding up his sore feet with strips torn from his robe as he walked. He demanded\nthe same level of commitment from his followers. They all had to subscribe to the exact same\ndoctrine, and follow the orders of a leader who assigned them to work for certain lords when the\nopportunity arose (often they specialized in defensive warfare). The leader taxed their official\nsalaries and disciplined them to stick to the party line, even by death. Perhaps this is why Mozi\u2019s\nmovement ultimately failed: smart people rarely like being bossed around. But Mozi\u2019s ideas\nwere influential: for instance, it was he who made the strongest argument for meritocracy: that\nthat the most qualified man should be put in office.\nDaoists opposed ritual on other grounds, but also opposed elevating worthy men to office.\nAt least, those are the surface messages of the texts Dao De Jing, and Zhuangzi. The Dao De\nJing (Classic of the Way and Power) is associated with a possibly mythical figure named Lao\nDao and called Laozi, \u201cMaster Lao,\u201d or \u201cOld Master.\u201d It began as collections (not just one) of\nsayings by spiritual teachers (\u201cOld Masters\u201d) from as early as 350 BC, which were redacted and\nChapter 2, p. 21 42\ncombined for easy memorization; it attained something like its current form by about 200 BC,\nbut was not finalized until as late as AD 300. On the surface, its message seems political, or\nperhaps anti-political, but it is also an esoteric spiritual teaching about meditation and other\npractices. In the Warring States period, Daoist adepts pursued longevity and special powers like\nflight, whether into realms of alternative consciousness or real realms beyond the human. The\nZhuangzi is more discursive, telling stories and making arguments.\nConfucians, Daoists, and Mohists all opposed offensive war, the basic condition of their\ntime. Even a thinker/school closely associated with war, Sunzi, argued that warfare was so\ndestructive that it was best to gain one\u2019s end more cheaply if possible. But victory required\nknowing everything about a situation: the terrain, logistics, the weather, the capacities of troops\nand spies, but also how to manage psychological things like fear, punishment, and morale. The\nSunzi makes great reading (find it on ctext.org) and was appreciated by military commanders at\nleast since Cao Cao, who wrote its first surviving commentary as he gathered together the\nthreads of leadership after the fall of Han in AD 202. Many of the Legalists, on the other hand,\npromoted warfare, but they enthusiastically echoed Sunzi\u2019s drive for information.\nLegalism arose as a practical result of interstate competition. Guanzi, for instance, wrote\nabout what kinds of information should be collected on working households to make the most of\ntheir labor. He included the directive to \u201cInquire about the men and women who possess skills:\nhow many can be usefully employed to make sturdy equipment? How many unmarried women\nremain at home engaged in domestic labor?\u201d21 A book attributed to Qin advisor L\u00fc Buwei\nrecommended that state track \u201cslaves, clothing, maps, bows, chariots, carts, boats, oxen, palaces,\nwine, wells, mortars (for grinding), physicians, and shamans,\u201d as well as omens.22\nLegalism gathered theoretical strength in essays written by Xunzi (3rd century BC). A\ndisciple of Confucius, Xunzi was criticized or neglected by later Confucians. He argued that\nrituals were not timeless expressions of the ways of heaven and earth; rather, they were\nmanmade and purposely deployed by rulers. If rituals could be deployed for government, rather\nthan valued for themselves, then other means of managing people could also be justified: laws\nand punishments. Laws and punishments were not new; what was new was the idea that they\nwere the best, or only, way to create social order.\nXunzi\u2019s student, the Legalist Han Feizi (d. 233 BC), who worked for Qin, wrote that the\nidea of governing by virtue and ritual was nonsense as the chaos of the times showed. The only\nway to keeps people in line is firm, unavoidable punishment for breaking the law. And the law is\nestablished not by precedent, like ritual; nor by agreement among high-ranking men; but only by\na supreme ruler, set above all others. Punishment for breaking the law should be as certain as it\nis that molten gold will burn your hand.\nThe next chapter will show how Legalism contributed to bringing down the system that\nConfucius cherished, and recombining all the feudal domains into a new mode: the empire.\nChapter 2, p. 22 43\nFig. 2.8.

By 300 BC, there were only seven large and a few small ones left. The dukes one after\nanother took the title of \u201cKing.\u201d No longer feudal domains, they were territorial states with clear\nboundaries demarcated by long walls \u2013 walls that were not even meant to stop the fighting. For\nthe point of the territorial state was to acquire more land and labor, usually through war. From\n535 BC until 286 BC the Zhou states saw 358 wars, more than one a year. Different large states\n\u2013Wei, then Qi and Qin -- rose to the dominant position and then fell, while small states\ndesperately maneuvered between the horizontal strategy (allying oneself with one great power)\nand the vertical strategy (many small states allying together). Meanwhile, members of the ruling\nclass within each state quarreled more and more violently with one another. As the rulers built\nthemselves enormous above-ground tombs, their earthly power far outstripped that of their\nkinfolk. Another complication was that in many domains, ministerial families usurped thrones,\nand lords hired talented knights instead of assigning government positions according to heredity.\nThe fiefs had become states, and the basics of war changed. Until about 500 BC, war ran\non bronze weapons, chariots, and warriors organized by aristocratic clans, in armies no larger\nthan several thousand soldiers. Late in the Warring States period Qi, Qin and Chu could each\nfield a million men, and 100,000 to 200,000 soldiers might take part in a single battle. Chariots\nsurrounded by foot soldiers were replaced with cavalry and huge infantry units, carefully ranked\nand with specialist commanders. Instead of compound bows there were deadly crossbows, along\nwith swords. Instead of wounding an enemy, or chasing an army back, the objective was to kill.\nAlong with walls, iron, horses, and slaughter, another great change was the slow\nappearance of a new social rank: commoners. In the feudal system they had been only an\nunnamed residual category of no political importance, a motley array of serfs working on the\nZhou aristocratic estates, sixth-generation feudal sons cast off by the aristocracy, people who had\nbeen living in the Zhou lands before the conquest, and incorporated Di and Rong people. Now\nthe kings were courting them to work new lands in the counties, and serve in ever-larger armies\nof infantry. Commoners began \u2013 slowly \u2013 to emerge into political view. A key reason for their\nrise was that iron weapons could arm far more soldiers.\nFig. 3.1 Knife with iron blade and hollow bronze handle, 1st millennium BC, mainland. Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art.

But fighting from\nhorseback is a completely different skill, developed later in world history. Warring States armies\nlearned about cavalry from their northern neighbors, the Hu. These nomadic clans headed by\nmounted archers lived in the upper Ordos area (under the bump in the Yellow River). They first\nappear in Zhou records in 457 BC. The Hu sold or granted to the Zhou states horses, other\nanimals, furs, and wine and millet made by the farming people they dominated. In return, Zhou\nstates sent gold and silver items, belts with precious shells, pearls, sometimes a matched team of\nfour horses, and silk. And women: as with relations between Zhou states, the exchange of wives\nsignaled and solidified political alliance, for children would then be descended from both sides.\nNorthern excavations have found gold plaques with characters recording their weight, and hoards\nof coins. The coins signal an extensive monetized trade, as the mounted aristocrats of both the\nZhou and the Hu added control of trade and production to their rule by violence.\nZhou states were willing to pay for horses because they were the new war machines of\nthe day. In 307 BC, the king of Zhao was expanding northwards. He wanted to train his armies\nin mounted archery, which meant wearing trousers instead of the traditional gown. When the\naristocrats of Zhao objected to adopting foreign clothing, the king reminded first them of the\nlong practice of deploying foreigners against other states, and second that sage-kings and former\nrulers had changed their ways to suit the times. Third, the Zhao king argued that it was not right\nto condemn other cultures \u2013 an important perspective, since the various Zhou states themselves\nwere increasingly diverging in culture. Fourth, he argued that tools must fit the need; just as one\nuses boats on rivers, so to fight in hilly lands one needs horses. To implement his policy, he\nrelied on northern locals in his new territory: men who knew neighboring nomads from trade and\nother interactions \u2013 and men who could ride. As cavalry warfare spread, the commercialized\nnorthern frontier, with horses to offer, became strategically important to its neighbors.\nBoth the Central States and non-Zhou tribes built long walls of packed earth. Closely\nhugging the high ground, the walls allowed soldiers to look far and wide for enemy movement.\nLarge numbers of soldiers manned the walls, supported by garrisons (of which archaeologists\nhave found evidence), roads and beacon stations, couriers and postal systems for communication.\nContrary to the common view, the long walls did not mark a clear cultural boundary between\nsteppe and sown (agricultural land), for there is plenty of steppe land, with nomadic sites, to the\nsouth of the walls, and some agriculture north of them. Nor were walls built to defend against\ninvasions from the north. Yan, Zhao, and Qin built walls after they had expanded their states\nnorthwards, deep into nomad lands. The walls were forward offensive lines meant to hold new\nterritory. Zhao, for instance, continued to expand beyond its wall, both as a matter of state policy\nand simply because soldiers raided for booty. Far from being effective defenses, walls enclosed\nnew territory, and as territory grew, defense became more difficult.1\nThe Feudal State of Qin\nQin was one of the expanding Zhou border states. Its history falls into four stages, hazier\nthe further back we go, of course: early origins; as a Zhou feudal domain (800-380 BC); as a\nrising state beginning in 384-338 BC under Dukes Xian and Xiao and culminating in its defeat of\nall the other states in 221 BC; and as ruler of the unified empire for fifteen years.\nChapter 3, p. 3 48\nThe Qin ruling family (surnamed Ying) may have begun as eastern supporters of the\nremnant Shang rebellion against Zhou right after 1045 BC, who were then exiled out West. Or\nthey may originally have come from the western Rong people. They may have claimed they\nwere descended from high ancestors (di) who had served sage-kings Shun and Yu, and the Shang\ndynasty. Both texts and archaeological finds have been interpreted to support all these views.\nWhatever their start point, the Qin lords were enfeoffed along the western edge of the\nZhou world in about 771 BC, after wresting the area \u201cwithin the passes\u201d from the Rong and Di\ntribes who had invaded the Zhou capital. The Zhou king entrusted them with fending off further\nattacks from the west. That meant they controlled the route to Sichuan, which as we shall see\nunderlay their final victory. Sima Qian treats Qin mainly as barbarians themselves, but the\nmaterial record shows that they were fully a part of the Zhou ritual-cultural world. The dukes of\nQin intermarried with the Zhou royal house: a bronze vessel excavated in the 1980s recorded\nauthoritative speeches by a Zhou royal princess who married Duke Xian of Qin in about 700 BC.\nRelations were close; even after Zhou kings had ceased making royal inspection visits elsewhere,\nthey continued to visit Qin. Qin demonstrated its adherence to Zhou ritual norms by retaining\nthe shapes and sets of its bronze vessels.\nBut Qin dukes also developed their own burial customs: they replaced real bronze vessels\nwith miniature versions in other materials for grave goods, and made up for this parsimony by\nbuilding much bigger tombs than other feudal lords. One of the excavated Qin ducal tombs\nincluded the bones of 186 human victims, 20 with no coffins (some of these also had no heads),\n94 with small coffins, and 72 with large coffins. Those with coffins may have been killed by\npoison, since their hair contained high levels of arsenic and mercury.2 That scale of ritual human\nsacrifice, including the probable murder of people high-ranking enough to merit their own big\ncoffins, suggests that the dukes of Qin exerted an impressive degree of control.\nThey expressed their confidence in words. An excavated Qin bronze tureen cast perhaps\naround 600 BC has an inscription inside it that says:\nThe Duke of Qin said: \u201cGreatly illustrious were my ancestors. They received\nHeaven\u2019s Mandate and tranquilly dwelt in [sage-king] Yu\u2019s tracks\u2026 They\nreverently respected and greatly revered Heaven\u2019s Mandate, protected and\nregulated their [domain of] Qin, and vigilantly cared for the Man [non-Chinese]\nand the Xia [Zhou-world people].\u201d3\nNo other state made such a claim to centrality. In standard ideological terms, the Mandate was\nheld by the Zhou royal house, not by its vassal lords in the domains. Qin\u2019s cockiness may have\ncome from its easily defensible position in the west, similar to that of Zhou when it planned its\nconquest of Shang. In time, Qin created a society totally organized for war, and one that\nweakened the aristocrats below the dukes to a previously unimaginable extent.\nChapter 3, p. 4 49\nFig. 3.2 Seventeenth-century rubbing of an inscription by a Qin duke, c. 450 BC, on the Ten Stone Drums,\nrecording a successful hunt. Can you read it? Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nShang Yang\u2019s Legalist Policies in Qin\nThe key figure in reorganizing the Qin state and society for war and against aristocracy\nwas Legalist thinker Shang Yang (d. 338 BC), a Wey prince who had worked for Wei and then\nimmigrated to Qin. There were other reformers before and after him, but his biography in the\nShi ji and the record of policies in The Book of Lord Shang most clearly illustrate key changes.\nDuke Xian (r. 384-362 BC) appointed him Chief Minister of Qin. All other schools of thought\nlooked back to an ideal distant past, but like other Legalists, Shang Yang rejected taking the past\nas a model. Shang Yang pointed to evidence in the Classics that as conditions had changed in\nthe past, so had institutions: that the sage-kings Yao and Shun had different institutions from the\nZhou kings, for instance. He told Duke Xian, \u201cA wise man creates laws, but a worthless man is\ncontrolled by them; a man of talent reforms rituals, but a worthless man is enslaved by them.\u201d\nThe Duke let Shang Yang totally reorganize the Qin state to increase ducal power.\nShang Yang drew on practices that had been developing in Qin and other states, on the\nnew possibilities of iron technology, and on Legalist ideas, to overturn the feudal order in Qin\nand create a bureaucratic state and social structure. His reforms undermined, abolished, and\ndestroyed the Zhou feudal aristocracy in the state of Qin and then everywhere else. They\nincreased the control of revenue and labor of the Qin King and his central government. They\nfinalized the creation of a new class, commoners, who were no longer serfs on feudal estates, but\nworked their own small farms. And they introduced meritocracy, which made it possible for\nthose ordinary people to win honor, wealth, and even power based on effort and talent. The Qin\nregime\u2019s power came precisely from its commoners, who served as soldiers and laborers.4\nChapter 3, p. 5 50\nWould-be autocrats across East Asia returned again and again to the strategy of recruiting lower-\nranking people to work in government, in order to circumvent high-ranking men and women\nwith sufficient social clout to oppose the ruler. Socially weaker people were more likely than\naristocrats to obey the ruler and serve his interests.\nAs I present Shang Yang\u2019s reforms, I will also glance back at their longer-term origins.\nAfter 221 BC, Qin promulgated bureaucracy across the Zhou world to create the unified empire.\nShang Yang\u2019s reforms provided a model for all subsequent East Asian governance.\nIron and Water\nFirst, technology and production. The critical technological factor in the intensifying\nwarfare of the period from about 500 to 200 BC was iron. Bronze is made of mainly of copper,\nwhich is relatively easy to extract and work. Iron is harder to get at than copper, and melts at a\nhigher temperature, so it postdates bronze in human technological history. But it is much more\ncommon in the earth, so once the technology was developed, it meant that more people could\nhave metal tools and weapons. Ironworking first came to Central Asia in about 1000 BC (and\nreached Africa about the same time).5 Small iron objects have been excavated from today\u2019s\nXinjiang in the far west of China from about 900 BC, and iron-smelting had come to Zhou lands\nby about 800 BC. After about 400 BC, iron replaced bronze in weaponry, and was used for tools.\nIron was cheaper and tougher than bronze. It meant higher productivity of land and labor: that is,\nfewer people could grow more grain on the same amount of land, cut down trees more quickly,\nand so on. Iron tools meant that the population of commoners grew, and more soldiers could be\nfed; iron weapons meant that more soldiers could be armed. Both developments contributed to\nthe increasing warfare of the time.\nQin was, in archaeologist Arthur Cotterell\u2019s words, \u201cexceptionally apt\u201d at picking up and\npromulgating the production and use of iron, as well as other technology.6 In 350, Qin moved its\ncapital eastwards to Xianyang, right in the center of the Guanzhong plain, and encouraged people\nto clear new farmland and create irrigation canals.7 Key to Qin\u2019s conquest were the work of\nlaborers and the brains of an engineer, Li Bing. As a Qin official in Sichuan, from about 250-\n240 BC, Li Bing persuaded Sichuan natives and Qin colonists to construct a remarkable\nirrigation system in which a levee divided the Min river into two halves. One of the two streams\nacted as a flood channel and carried boat traffic; the other branched into numerous small streams\nand canals that carried water into a network of thousands of tiny irrigation ditches. Li harnessed\na natural force to push water through the irrigation system: he knew that where a river bends, the\nwater on the outside of the curve will travel faster than on the inside. The system, now called\nDujiangyan, turned the Sichuan basin around Chengdu into a bread basket that fueled the Qin\nconquest and is still working today.\nDujiangyan requires annual upkeep by the families and communities of the area, but\ncompared with its benefits the work is minimal, and it has been done century after century. In\nthe Han period (in 2 CE), because the system made the area so wealthy, more people lived in\nChengdu than anywhere else except the imperial capital, Chang\u2019an. One source listed\nChengdu\u2019s products in the Han period:\nThe earth grows the five grains; the sacrificial victims include all six domestic\nanimals. Mulberry trees, silkworms, hemp, ramie, fish, salt, bronze, iron,\ncinnabar, lacquer, tea, and honey; the divine turtle, the great rhinoceros, long-\nChapter 3, p. 6 51\ntailed pheasant, silver pheasant; shimmering golden fabrics and bright cosmetics \u2013\nall these they offer as tribute.\u201d8\nA twelfth-century scholar marveled at the prosperity Li Bing\u2019s system still brought the Chengdu\nplain:\nThere are grand houses in the City of Pi; every house has running water and tall\nbamboo\u2026 There are thousands of big bamboos, dripping thick and green\u2026 Early\nin the morning I made a brief stop at Ande Town\u2026 In one direction the river\ndivides and flows into all the [irrigation] ditches with a thunderous sound, curling\nup like snow, as the beautiful fields fill the eyes.9\nBecause of Sichuan\u2019s wealth, it often became a kingdom unto itself as imperial dynasties faltered.\nThe system still feeds people now. It rebounded from destruction in the 1640s and the Great\nLeap Forward in the 1950s, but present-day urbanization and larger farms are challenging its\nhealth. The Dujiangyan system gave Qin, a northern state, access to southern rice with which to\nfeed its many soldiers, armed with iron.\nMeritocracy and Bureaucracy\nSecond, Shang Yang replaced the inheritance of state power with meritocratic\nrecruitment. The idea that the best man for a government job should be chosen for it, rather than\na person being born with the right to hold a certain government position was not entirely new.\nEarly Zhou Mandate of Heaven propaganda, for instance, claimed that Heaven chose King Wen\nand King Wu to replace the wicked Shang King Chow because of their merit; but their\ndescendants\u2019 rule was justified by descent, not individual merit. Although appointment by\nheredity was the norm, within the Zhou royal domains (not out in the fiefs) an elite man might be\nappointed to a government post based on his ability, and promoted on the basis of his\naccomplishments. As the feudal lords developed their domains economically and their regimes\npolitically, they drew on low-ranking knights who had good ideas to offer them. But most Zhou\npolitical power was inherited. It was revolutionary to follow Mozi\u2019s idea that the ruler should\nreject his kin and other aristocrats, and select totally unrelated, perhaps not even noble, men to\ngovern.\nThird, the new meritocratically-recruited personnel staffed a new kind of state structure.\nBureaucracy replaced feudalism. Feudal lords had mainly ruled their domains as they saw fit,\nunless the Zhou king had specifically forbidden something, and they passed their domains on to\ntheir sons. Bureaucrats (or officials), by contrast, could do only what the ruler or his laws\nspecifically instructed. Officials served for limited terms and their descendants did not inherit\ntheir positions. Bureaucracy had been invented in the rich and powerful middle-Yangzi area\n(Hunan) state of Chu. By about 500 BC, in areas he had just conquered, the Chu king had set up\n130 units conceived of as \u201changing\u201d (xian) from the basic feudal structure: ruled differently from\nmost of Chu under its feudal lord, but not replacing their feoffs. The king of Chu wanted to draw\nas much grain and military service as possible from the free people (i.e., not serfs) living in the\narea, so instead of enfeoffing his kinsfolk there, he set magistrates over the people for only short\nperiods. He recruited them from among the knights (shi) who did not have their own land, and\ndismissed or executed them if they disobeyed him. Much easier than punishing a high-ranking\nlord with his own land and warriors!\nChapter 3, p. 7 52\nOther states adopted counties too. Counties enhanced royal power and eroded the power\nof other feudal clans in three ways. First, they reorganized land the feudal lord took away from\naristocratic clans who lost factional battles at court. Second, under the management of knights\nempowered as county magistrates, counties produced grain and supplied labor directly to the\nking. By about 350, knights held about two-thirds of the offices in the various states; since they\ndid not have their own land, they could be put in charge of counties. Third, commoners could be\nlured away from the feudal estates by promises that they would be taxed but not required to do\nadditional labor, or even that their county land would be tax-exempt for a certain time. In fact,\nsome commoners worked their way up into the knightly class \u2013 for this period Li Feng translates\nthe term shi as \u201cman of service\u201d to stress that the knights\u2019 developed a shared moral commitment\nto administration and a shared sense of identity. Confucius came from the shi rank, and some of\nhis shi disciples, like Zengzi, began as commoners. When young, Zengzi grew melons.10\nShang Yang expanded the Chu model. He organized all of Qin territory into counties\n(xian), each headed by a magistrate responsible directly to the Qin ruler. Magistrates had to\nfollow Qin laws and administrative regulations, and they served in each place for only a short\nterm, nor did they pass the job on to their sons. Officials managed population registration and\ntaxation, military affairs, and justice \u2013 settling disputes and strictly punishing crimes according\nto the law. The center appointed, dismissed, promoted, or demoted them based on their\nperformance. (Needless to say, the system was not carried out precisely as it appeared on the\nbooks. No system is.) Officials replaced the Qin aristocracy in government as ministers, high\nofficers, and advisors, too. After the conquest, Qin put into practice the \u201claw of avoidance,\u201d\nwhich prohibited officials from serving in their home areas. The law of avoidance and frequent\ntransfers assured that an official would neither favor his relatives nor be able to use his position\nto build up a power base that could threaten the throne. After the conquest, some counties were\nalso grouped into commanderies that dealt with military conscription.\nThis Chu and Qin invention, called the commandery-county (junxian \u90e1\u7e23) system,\nbecame the cornerstone organizing principle of the Chinese government, carried on by later\ndynasties in different ways but on the same principles, and adopted by other East Asian regimes\nas their kings centralized. When Zhou fell, monarchy continued and even gained in strength, but\nadministration purely by those born to a certain rank was over, and some commoners even had a\nchance hold power as government officials. For the time being\u2026\nTaxation\nFourth, along with the implementation of meritocratic personnel recruitment and\nbureaucratic state structure came new fiscal policies. Shang Yang completed a new way for the\nstate to collect resources from society. His reforms claimed all land in the Qin state for the Qin\nKing. Taking away the aristocratic estates, he measured every foot of farmland, and cut farmland\nup into uniform parcels large enough to support one nuclear family. A grid of footpaths marked\nthe boundaries between them. He took a census to count and register the entire population, and\ngave out the small parcels of land to farming families as their private property. This destroyed\nthe economic base of noble power and set up the foundation for a new fiscal arrangement\nbetween state and society: taxation.\nFormer serfs became taxpaying \u201ccommoners,\u201d and were granted surnames. The term\n\u201chundred surnames\u201d (\u767e\u59d3), which had earlier referred to the aristocracy as a whole, now meant\nChapter 3, p. 8 53\ntaxpaying commoners.11 Each family received the amount of land that one adult male could\nwork, with an adult female partner to manage other household production. Qin farmers were not\npermitted to sell their land. The state remained active in many areas of production, including\nkeeping some agricultural land that was worked by convicts for the state directly, and managing\nmarkets for buying and selling goods. Each married couple owed duties in return for their land:\nlabor service and military service, tax in grain (about 10% of the harvest \u2013 the husband\u2019s\nresponsibility) and tax in cloth (the wife\u2019s responsibility.) If there were two adult sons, Shang\nYang first required that one set up on his own; later, he required that even just one adult son\nleave his parents\u2019 house. (Daughters normally married out.) Families that insisted on staying\ntogether owed double the tax on each adult. (Excavated texts show that some adult fathers and\nsons did continue to live together, however.) Property was divided among all sons.\nIn this system, farmers with small holdings gained a kind of autonomy. They were\ncitizens themselves, not serfs on feudal estates. But empowering them and dignifying them was\nnot the aim. Rather, smallholders like this were easier to control than the feudal nobility with\ntheir many relatives and great estates, and the amount of grain, cloth, and labor available to the\nQin government increased.\nExcavated Qin population registers list names, marital status, and the labor service owed\nby the household head. They list the names of the wife, children, and slaves. Initially, the\nheights of men were listed to determine whether they owed military service, but as the\ndocumentary record built up, ages were listed. Registers also recorded household clothing, tools,\nand animals, how big the house was, and whether the roof was tiled. In ideal Legalism, recorded\nin The Book of Lord Shang, women were also subject to military conscription, but Qin\napparently conscripted women only for labor. Ordinary people now contributed directly to the\nstate.\nAs Qin conquered more territory, it gradually took in and then displaced local elites,\nturning them and their subjects into taxpayers. The process had to be gradual, because to meet\nresistance with overwhelming force would be to undermine the tax base. Negotiation meant\nvariation. For instance, as Qin expanded in Sichuan, it put one local clan in charge of all the\npeople there, and Qin women were sent to intermarry with this lordly Ba clan and begin a\nprocess of cultural mingling. The Ba clan had to pay Qin 2,016 copper cash every year and an\nadditional 8,200 cash every three years (the latter was called a \u201cloyalty tax\u201d). But this was not a\nfeudal system, for each household of commoners also paid taxes directly to Qin: 82 feet of a\nlocal kind of cloth, and chicken feathers. (How many chicken feathers? The weight of 30\narrowheads.12) Gradually, but never completely, local powers and cultures melded with imperial\nculture.\nEarned Social Rank\nFifth, along with creating a tax base of smallholders, reforms changed the social\nhierarchy. Since at least the time of Confucius, around 500 BC, the feudal ranking system had\nbeen challenged, as ministerial families took over dukedoms and high-official families took over\nministerial slots. People claimed ranks and privileges to which they were not entitled. But now\nShang Yang in Qin systematically eliminated aristocracy altogether (except for the royal family).\nEach man in the whole population was assigned to one of 17 ranks, based on military service.\nFootsoldiers began at the bottom rank. Cutting off one enemy head in battle earned a one-step\nChapter 3, p. 9 54\nrank promotion and five acres of land. A soldier who surrendered to the enemy, if recaptured,\nwould be executed. All his property would be confiscated. Each earned rank came with\nprivileges \u2013 the right to wear certain clothes, additional land and houses, the right to hold a\nnumber of convict slaves to work the land.\nBut unlike feudal rank, these social ranks came with no political authority, nor were they\npermanent. The central government could demote a person, or someone convicted of a crime\none could trade in a level of rank to avoid punishment. Sons inherited rank at least one degree\nlower, and inherited rank was more steeply reduced for higher ranks. The only exception was\nthat if a man died heroically in battle, his eldest son would inherit not only his rank but his\npromotion for that battle. In peacetime, a higher rank could be earned based on how much grain\nand cloth one produced for the state. Rank still formed a part of people\u2019s conception of state and\nsociety, but social rank and political rank were severed, and family and individual rank were\nalmost severed. Meritocracy was challenging the aristocratic idea that some families were just\nbetter than others.\nSurveillance and Law\nSixth. Taxation and labor duties formed one major nexus of interaction between state and\nsociety; earned social rank another; and Qin further built on earlier practices in the states to\ncreate new arrangements for state control over population and crime. The warring states had\ndeveloped written laws (some have been excavated, written on strips of bamboo), legal processes,\nconcern with accurate records of population, etc. Each county magistrate in most states had to\nsubmit an annual report, carved on a wooden block, that included field measurements; numbers\nof people of each age, generation, and occupation; granary holdings; and the details of security\narrangements. These reports were not used only to control the working population, but also to\nmonitor the weather and harvest. The Qin Statutes on Agriculture decreed:\nWhenever the rain is beneficial and affects the grain in ear, a report in writing is\nto be made concerning the favored crop and the grain in ear, as well as the\nacreage of cultivated fields and areas without crops. Whenever it rains when the\ncrop is already fully grown, the quantity of rain and acreage affected should still\nbe reported in writing. Likewise, in cases of drought and violent wind or rain,\nfloods, or hordes of grasshoppers or other creatures that damage the crops, the\nacreage concerned is always to be reported in writing. Nearby commanderies:\nhave lightfooted runners deliver the letter! Distant commanderies: have the\ncourier service deliver it! \u2013 by the end of the eighth month.13\nReporting also closely monitored officials. The state structure included supervisors and\ninspectors, and standards of salary (in kind, not in cash), promotion, and demotion. In theory,\nQin officials had to report in detail every single thing they did. Excavated (preserved) primary\nsources show that four separate signatures were required for grain coming in to a granary.\nThe Zhou king\u2019s control had stopped with the feudal lords, but the Qin central\ngovernment aimed to control each individual citizen, making everyone adhere to the same code\nof law. Even before Shang Yang, Qin had put people into mutual responsibility groups, called\n\u201cgroups of five.\u201d They were responsible for watching one another, and reporting crimes in the\ngroup. This was a war on crime \u2013 as Sima Qian explains of Shang Yang\u2019s reforms:\nChapter 3, p. 10 55\nAnyone who failed to report criminal activity would be chopped in two at the\nwaist, while those who reported it would receive the same reward as that for\nobtaining the head of an enemy. Anyone who actively hid a criminal would be\ntreated the same as one who surrendered to the enemy.\n(Do you remember the reward for a head and the punishment for surrender?) People had to\nrequest official permission to move or change their occupation. Merchants, because they moved\naround and did not produce, were highly suspect, and Qin registered merchants and deported\nthem from towns to serve as soldiers on the frontiers.\nWas Qin really able to control people this closely? Not in every case \u2013 there was a lot of\nvariation in practice, as always. But the level of control was impressive. For instance, travelers\nwere required to show identification at a number of points along the roads, and actual travel\npermits for Qin citizens have now been excavated, including one for a five-year-old. Excavated\ntax accounts show that local headmen tracked exactly whether each group of 2-5 households had\npaid taxes and done their labor service, along with how much of the tax in hay they had paid in\ncash instead of in kind. Population registers were so widespread and effective that they entered\nthe realm of religion: gods tracked the deeds of the living and the souls of the dead.\nQin punishments were harsh. Shang and Zhou had used some mutilating punishments,\nsuch as cutting off the nose, foot, or testicles, and Qin continued them.14 Qin legal punishments\nincluded death by boiling in a cauldron, removing ribs, tattooing the face, and shaving a man\u2019s\nhair and beard as a symbolic castration. One could be flogged for littering in the streets of the\ncapital. A person\u2019s relatives were held guilty alongside him, as were his \u201cgroup of five\u201d if they\nhad not reported his crime. Another punishment was penal servitude, which provided a lot of\nlabor for the state; one register from the year 213, after the conquest contains a list of 4,376\nbondservants in one place, male and female. Such state violence was brutal, indeed.\nBut besides harshness, there is another side to Qin law that underlines the revolutionary\nnature of the reforms. First, the laws were the same for everyone (except the royal family),\nformer aristocrat and commoner alike. Second, the legal process aimed at fairness and\nimpartiality. That is confirmed by laws and regulations written on bamboo strips have recently\nbeen excavated from Qin graves.15 Third, Qin law valued human life. Unfilial behavior was a\ncapital crime, but so was maiming or killing a child. That makes sense: parents and children were\nboth state assets. Likewise, Qin edicts express values like \u2018caring for the people\u2019 and protecting\nthem from too much state exploitation, and values like \u2018sincerity\u2019 and \u2018benevolence\u2019 appear in\nofficials\u2019 seal-names. Even the Legalist Qin needed the idea of virtue to hold the system\ntogether. We will see that no regime can last long without both organization and ideology.\nWhen the Duke Xian of Qin, Shang Yang\u2019s patron, died in 338, the nobles\u2019 bitter hatred\nfor Shang Yang erupted. They accused him of making trouble for the state and he fled. He\nsought shelter for the night in a tiny backwoods inn. The innkeeper did not recognize him, but\nturned him away: the new laws set up by Lord Shang, he said, forbade admitting a man without a\ntravel permit\u2026 Shang Yang raised troops from his own estate to oppose the central armies he\nhad worked so hard to build up, but he was defeated. His corpse was tied to four chariots and\ntorn apart as the horses were driven in opposite directions, and his entire family was killed.\nChapter 3, p. 11 56\nInventing Empire\nThe Zhou order had worked through the King sharing honor and authority with the feudal\nlords. As Qin adopted Legalist policies and relied on commoners, aristocrats were still in power\nacross the rest of the Zhou world, overseeing reforms that were similar, but less radical. Their\nvalues were slow to change. Among other things, they tended to fight in such a way that they\nand their opponents could live to fight another day. As a Duke of Song, according to the Zuo\nCommentary, explained when refusing to attack enemy forces fording a river, \u201cA gentleman does\nnot inflict a second wound. He does not capture those with graying hair\u2026 I will not drum to\nattack when they have not drawn up ranks.\u201d Defeated armies went home, and defeated states\nwere not wiped out. The cohesion of the ruling class sharing authority was still strong. It took a\nsecond key advisor to change that, and invent the unified, centralized empire.\nFan Sui (d. 255 BC) came to Qin from the state of Qi to work as an advisor to the Qin\nrulers. It was he who energized them to follow through on their aim of uniting all the Zhou\nstates. Fan insisted on direct royal rule, he attacked every attempt to parcel out new territory as\nfiefs instead of counties, he insisted on constant expansion, he developed professional troops to\nsupplement the conscripts and replace all aristocratic soldiers, \u2013 and he demanded that Qin not\nonly seize territory, but also kill people. No longer content to win battles, Qin slaughtered\ndefeated soldiers. At the battle of Changping in 260 BC, for instance, Qin forces supposedly\nkilled 400,000 Zhao soldiers. That may be an exaggeration, but the policy made conquest final.\nThe Qin duke, now calling himself \u201cking,\u201d aimed at being the supreme ruler \u2013 the only man in all\nthe states with a hereditary right to rule. Supreme rulership was built both on the productive and\nmilitary labor of the common people, as organized by Shang Yang, and on their pitiless slaughter,\ninstigated by Fan Sui.\nThe Qin war machine gobbled up one state after another, \u201cas a silkworm devours a\nmulberry leaf,\u201d in the words of Sima Qian. In 256 Qin, shockingly, took over the tiny remaining\nZhou royal domain. King Zheng, the \u201ctiger of Qin,\u201d led his forces to victory after victory,\nbringing down the state of Hann in 230 BC, Zhao in 228, and Wei in 225 BC. In 223, he\ndefeated his most impressive rival, the southern state of Chu; the northern state of Yan fell in 222;\nand with the fall of Qi the next year, the new empire was complete. King Zheng credited his\nancestors with his victory and began a grand ancestral cult to them. Qin had won the arms race\nby relying on iron and water, destroying the feudal system, creating meritocracy and bureaucracy,\nand registering every bit of data it could; and now it had created the first mainland East Asian\nempire.\nThe Information State\nHaving created the first empire by organization and force, Qin further took control of the\neconomy of all the former Zhou domains. The whole country was divided up into commanderies\nand counties. Land was measured. Every family was registered, put into a mutual-responsibility\ngroup, ranked, and given land to provide labor, military service, grain, hay and animal fodder,\nand cloth to the state. Recommendation processes drew competent men in to serve the state, and\nthe former aristocrats were stripped of their titles. The central state took control of the means of\nproduction, including iron foundries, mines, all kinds of workshops, forests, and pastures for\nherds. It controlled labor directly, as well as through the small households, by sentencing\ncriminals to 1-6 years of hard labor: construction for men, husking and grinding grain for women,\nChapter 3, p. 12 57\nfarming for both. It controlled animal labor, creating huge stud farms and registering ownership\nof all animals. Local officials were not allowed to let animals graze on private land, but people\nwere also not permitted to cut wood in forests or hunt in game preserves owned by the state.\nThe Empire represented a new kind of political organization, with a new social and fiscal\nbase. So, it required new forms of ideology reaching new audiences. Qin built new ways to\nlegitimate its power out of the old traditions, texts, and practices of the Zhou states. Instead of\nprimarily limiting knowledge, historian Charles Sanft has argued that Qin\u2019s focus was on\ncreating a new knowledge. Qin worked hard to communicate to everyone that a new kind of\nauthority was running a new kind of polity. That knowledge could create cooperation, as more\nand more people expected of one another that they would act in accordance with knowledge of\nthe powerful center. As we look at some Qin policies, what appears is, first, that Qin drew on\nand revised some older forms of ritual display aimed at the elite to communicate with the whole\npublic; and second, that some policies can be interpreted both as practical and as contributing to\ncommunication with the public. How did the Qin undertake to turn its power based on violence\nand surveillance into widely-accepted authority?\nFirst, the rulers of the Warring States had collected people all schools of thought as\nadvisors and entertainers. In addition to contributing advice and special skills, these people, in\ntheir mere presence at court, displayed the ruler\u2019s power, like living bronze vessels. Now that it\nwas ruling a broad empire, Qin showed its power by hiring large numbers of scholars, called\n\u201cErudites,\u201d each with his own cadre of disciples. Many followed the teachings of Confucius and\nhis disciples. The emperor consulted the Erudites individually or as an assembly on matters of\npolicy. But the Erudites also had the task of pulling together all existing knowledge for the\nbenefit of the state. It is true that in 213 BC, in accordance with the Legalist doctrine that only\nthe emperor can determine right and wrong, the Qin limited free discussion among civilians,\noutlawing books of history and the \u201chundred schools\u201d philosophers. Only useful books, or those\nthat glorified Qin, were permitted among the general population: the historical annals of Qin\nitself, agricultural manuals, and books on divination and medicine. But the imperial library and\nthe Erudites personally were permitted to keep even outlawed books. The Erudites worked to\ncompile definitive editions, pulling together, the oral and written knowledge of the past that had\nbeen scattered throughout the various feudal states. Compiled in definitive editions, that\nknowledge now provided a shared textual basis for the unified empire. So, for instance, the Book\nof Documents that we have now was put together by these Confucian Erudites working for Qin.16\nThe Confucians often disagreed with the policies of the Qin emperor; pointing out when\nrulers were wrong, the hundred schools of thought had mostly agreed, was the real task of the\nloyal advisor. But they retained their positions right up \u2018til late in the short Qin period, until 209\nBC. Qin is often said to have \u201cburned all the books\u201d and to have buried scholars alive, but those\nslanders were invented in the Han period. In the next two chapters, we\u2019ll see when the books\nburned, how Han emperors interacted with Confucian scholars, and when they lifted the book\nban.\nIn addition to pulling together all the existing texts and knowledge of the feudal states,\nsecond, the First Emperor toured the empire to display to as many people as possible, not himself\nas the Shang kings had done (for he worried, with reason, about being assassinated), but his vast\nentourage. He stopped at old sacred places to offer sacrifices, again to impress and win the\nsupport of both the humans and the spirits of the territory. By sacrificing at Mount Tai, he\nChapter 3, p. 13 58\ncarried out what are known as the feng and shan sacrifices to claim the support of Heaven (Tian)\n\u2013 but outside of Mandate theory, because he claimed that his empire would last forever.\nThird, while the warring feudal lords had built huge tombs to show off, and walls to\nclaim territory, the First Emperor made changes to the landscape he passed through just to\nchange things. He knocked down walls and built new altars just to make people sit up and take\nnotice, and talk about the change. By simply talking about the new central state, people were\nspreading knowledge that it existed, and that in itself, Sanft argues, strengthened the government,\nirrespective of any rational argument about whether it was good or bad, divinely supported or not.\nFourth, Qin initiated the grandest building projects yet known. Laborers were forced to\nbuild enormous palaces in the capital, Xianyang, as well as the famous tomb of the First Emperor.\nThe capital city was designed as a microcosm, a copy of the whole universe: the palace was\nshaped like the Big Dipper, and enormous statues made of the metal of the weapons of the\nconquered states stood in for the constellations (some scholars argue that they were inspired by\nGreek statuary). To symbolize all places on earth, the former feudal aristocratic families, stripped\nof their rank and privileges, were moved to replicas of their former palaces in the Qin capital.\nFig. 3.3 Some of the clay soldiers in one pit at the tomb of the First Qin Emperor. The figures were mass\nproduced, limb by limb and head by head, then put together. Photo by Niall Chithelen, 2019. Public\nDomain.\nSome construction projects tied the whole empire together, such as canals, and 4,000\nmiles of roads. Carts were required to have a standard axle length, so that the ruts in the road\nwould be appropriate for all (like having a standard gauge for railroads). Archaeologists recently\nfound two enormous wooden Qin-era bridges over the Wei River in the middle of the Qin capital\nof Xianyang, each 300 yards long and 200 yards across. Roads, bridges, and canals seem purely\npractical, and the feudal lords had built plenty of them to speed their messengers and soldiers on\ntheir way. But Qin roads also communicated. Some were walled or elevated \u2013 the emperor\ncould move on them without being seen, but their presence put him in everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cThe\nDirect Road\u201d ran six hundred miles from Xianyang out to a site sacred to the Qin\u2019s greatest\nenemy, the Xiongnu in the northwest; but its name also advertised that Qin followed the \u201cstraight\nway,\u201d \u2013 the ideal of fairness to all. Finally, the 4,250 miles of roads going in all directions from\nthe Qin capital, made of packed-down earth and carried over trestles and bridges where\nChapter 3, p. 14 59\nnecessary, each had three or five lanes. The outside lanes were for the public, going in opposite\ndirections; the next two for officials. A person who used the wrong part of the road would be\nbanished and his cart and ox or horse confiscated. The lane down the middle (as you have\nprobably guessed) was reserved for the emperor: even when he was not travelling on the road, he\nwould be present in people\u2019s consciousness.\nFifth, Qin created another kind of public text. A tiny number of people saw the Shang\noracle bones; Zhou bronze inscriptions were read aloud to a larger group of elite family members.\nNow, enormous stones and even mountainsides were inscribed with long texts praising the Qin\nemperor.\nSixth, when he became emperor, King Zheng of Qin chose a new title, so as not to be\nmore than a king: huangdi \u7687\u5e1d. Huang means \u201cshining\u201d or \u201caugust, elevated,\u201d and di \u2013\nremember? \u2013 originally referred to the Shang ancestors as a group and then to a high god,\nsometimes equivalent to \u201cHeaven.\u201d Calling himself \u201cShining Di\u201d or \u201cSplendid Di\u201d meant that\nthe Qin emperor was a kind of super-Daoist adept, who could bring order to the universe. One\nmountain inscription says: \u7687\u5e1d\u660e\u5fb7\u7d93\u7406\u5b87\u5185 \u201cThe bright potency of the Splendid Di aligns\nand arranges all within the universe.\u201d17\nSeventh, over the long Zhou period each state had developed its own coinage, writing,\nlaws and customs, and language. Now Qin \u2013 it is said \u2013 created uniform law; a uniform script,\nwith no regional variants permitted; a uniform coinage; and uniform weights and measures. To\ntake these in turn, uniform laws were enforced by and on officials across the empire. A uniform\ncurrency was not.18 Samples of Qin writing show that characters varied quite a lot, although\nscholars disagree on whether the differences amount to no more than different fonts.19 Different\nfonts \u2013 different fonts \u2013 different fonts.\nMost intriguingly, old systems of measurement may have persisted locally, but the\nhundreds of excavated Qin weights and measures are indeed fairly uniform: even when made in\ndifferent materials they vary only a little. Still, there was more to it than that. Every single\nmeasuring scoop and every single weight, whether made of bronze, iron, or pottery, is inscribed:\nIn the 26th year of his reign, the emperor completely unified all the various feudal\nlords of everything under the sky. The black-headed ones (i.e. the common\npeople) found great peace. He established the title \u201cemperor.\u201d Now he\ncommands Chancellors Zhuang \u72c0and Wan \u7db0: \u201cAs for the laws and units of\nmeasurement that are different or doubtful, clarify and unify all of them.\u201d20\nCharles Sanft concludes that the inscription was the main point of the widely-dispersed weights\nand measures. The new state wanted everyone to know that it was in charge, that it was in\ncharge everywhere, and that its officials carried out its laws, the same everywhere.\nChapter 3, p. 15 60\nFig. 3.4 Rubbing of the inscription on a Qin imperial weight, translated above. Fair Use.\nLike bronze vessels, the bronze plaques affixed to the weights were cast in clay molds.\nWith molds, only one person in any workshop making these plaques had to be able to write, to\ncreate the clay mold in the first place. In fact, if you look carefully, you can see that the workers\nmust have stamped the words into the clay molds. (Find the clue to that before you turn the page,\nthen look for the *.) If they first cast a bronze stamp or seal, even those who made the clay\nmolds to cast the plaques did not need to be able to write. They only had to keep the stamps in\norder. This plaque would have needed 10 seals (can you see why?), so I guess that they were\nnumbered 1 to 10 on the handle of the stamp. Molds and stamps increase standardization, and\nwere widely used in decoration of bronze vessels late in the Warring States period and to\ndecorate Han tombs. Indeed, stamps are a simple form of printing, which would not be invented\nfor another eight centuries or so.*\nQin had successfully ended centuries of bloody warfare to create a unified empire in\nwhich \u2013 even without printing \u2013 the central government knew of every person, and every person\nknew of the central government. Along with the texts of the whole Zhou tradition, the Qin model\nof Legalist centralized bureaucracy, with officials selected for their merit, and universal taxation\nof commoners, would eventually spread to the rest of East Asia. What could possibly go wrong?\n*\nI hypothesize that the straight lines and corners here were left by the edges of stamps used to\nstamp the characters into the clay molds. Each seal apparently held four characters.\nChapter 3, p. 16 61\n1 di Cosmo, Ancient China and its Enemies, chapter 4, pp. 128-153.\n2 Thanks to Yanxing Liu for these specifics.

The perception that the two\nregimes differed dramatically largely springs from Han political rhetoric rather than from\nsubstantive differences; the greatest difference was that Han lessened somewhat the ambition of\nthe information state to know everything about its subjects. It makes most sense to consider Qin\nand Han together as the first mainland empire. Jostled by the empire, groups in Manchuria and\non the peninsula began to organize, to adopt and develop bronze and iron technology, and to pass\nit to the archipelago.\nThe Fall of Qin\nWith the Iron Age, the common people burst onto the stage of history. The Qin had built\nits power on the sheer number of soldiers its farmers could feed, as well as on its willingness to\nkill the soldiers of opposing armies. It named, armed, and granted land and rank to the common\npeople, creating a new social force to support the emperor. It contributed to the world the\nLegalist idea that the state was a public possession, and a bureaucratically-organized government\nto realize that idea.\nAfter the death of the First Qin Emperor, laborers in Chu rebelled. Prime Minister Li Si\n(c. 280-208 BC), a long-time advisor, warned the Second Emperor:\nThe reason for all this rebellion is the bitter burden of garrison duty, building and\ntransport service, and heavy taxation. We propose calling a halt to the work on\nthe Apang Palace, and reducing transport duties and garrison service.\u201d\nThe Second Emperor replied:\nAccording to Han Feizi, \u201c[Sage-kings] Yao and Shun neither polished their oak\nrafters nor trimmed their thatched hut, and they ate and drank from earthen bowls,\nso that no gatekeeper could have lived more frugally. When [sage-king] Yu cut a\nchannel... to let the Yellow River flow to the ocean, he carried his tools himself,\nand worked till he rubbed all the hair off his legs. No slave could have toiled\nharder.\u201d\nBut what is splendid about possessing an empire is being able to do as you please\nand satisfy your desires. [As I learned from Han Feizi] By stressing and clarifying\nthe laws, a ruler can stop his subjects from doing evil and so control the land\nwithin the seas. If rulers like Shun and Yu, exalted as the Son of Heaven, have to\nlead poor, arduous lives to set an example to the people, what use are laws?\nThe Second Emperor has misinterpreted Legalism to mean he can do whatever he wants.\nNo state can afford to sacrifice entirely the well-being of the people. Even the old lords\nof the Warring States had had to make allowances for the popular temper and grant grain and\nmoney to desperate producers; they were called \u201cloans,\u201d but no repayment was expected. Qin,\ntoo, lent grain, draft animals, tools, money, and slaves to farmers. But driven by a new reality\nChapter 4, p.1\n\"An Outline History of East Asia to 1200, third edition\" by Sarah Schneewind is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.\nRetrieved from https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9d699767 63\ncreated by its obsessive accounting, its tracking of everything, Qin demanded repayment.\nConvicts, already working for no pay in mines and on infrastructure, were punished further if\ntheir tools broke. Likewise, farmers were used to resting in winter, but the Qin demanded labor\non its huge infrastructure projects during those months, including a canal system, the Long Wall\ndefensive system across the northern border, and the First Emperor\u2019s tomb. Resources like\nforests and forage land for animals had been communally owned, but the state took them over.\nPeople predictably responded by using up those resources when they could get away with it, so\nthe environment suffered and the government had to pass laws forbidding \u201cwaste.\u201d1\nAll these harsh demands turned farming families and forced laborers against the state.\nFormer aristocrats, still bitter, joined in rebellion, as did some Confucians. And an immense fire\nin the Qin capital in the resulting civil war destroyed the imperial library, with the enormous loss\nof books Han propagandists later blamed on Qin policies.\nIt was a commoner who finally won the civil war. Liu Bang (256 \u2013 195 BC) had held\noffice under Qin, passing a test to become a police chief. He was a rough, tough brawler, and his\nwife and partner L\u00fc Zhi (241-180 BC) was no more genteel. Still, Liu Bang was more honorable\nthan Xiang Yu, the aristocratic leader of a coalition of rebels. They had all agreed that whoever\ncaptured the Qin capital would become the next king of that desirable region \u2013 no-one was\nplanning to continue the unified empire, which had only lasted for 15 years, after all. Liu Bang\nand his troops captured the area, but rather than immediately claiming his prize he honorably\nsealed up the Qin treasuries until Xiang Yu arrived. When Xiang Yu did arrive, instead of\nhonoring the agreement, assigned Liu to a rule an area a bit further south, on the Han river. Liu\nBang turned against Xiang Yu, defeated him, and went on to win control of rest of Qin territory.\nHe named his empire after the river: \u201cHan.\u201d\nAs well as its territory, the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 220) inherited Qin\u2019s Legalist state\nsystem. Even the size of the land plots handed out to farmers remained the same, and satellite\nimages of northern mainland farmland still reveals strips of that standard size, about 360 yards\nlong.2 Han political theory recognized the support of commoners as the sound basis of the state;\nin the Western or Former Han (202 BC \u2013 AD 9) in practice, in the Eastern or Latter Han (AD 23-\n220)only in theory.\nFrom Commoner to Emperor\nMost immediately, however, Liu Bang (now Emperor Gaozu) had a problem: his\nsupporters. First, they wanted rewards. Liu Bang gave about 850 of his relatives and supporters\nlands and titles. Some were even called \u201ckings\u201d and governed fiefs on the old feudal model.\nFearing a return to warfare, the central government later retook some kingdoms by force. It used\nthe crimes of about half of the other nobles as an excuse for removing them, demoting some to\ncommoners, while others served terms as convict laborers. Another 170 were stripped of their\ntitles for no crime, and the rest simply failed to produce heirs. On average, the noble families\nlasted just over two generations, so not a single descendent of those Liu Bang had ennobled still\nheld a title by 86 BC. The Han dynasty had embraced and completed the Qin destruction of\naristocracy.\nLiu Bang faced a second problem with his supporters. Before Han, every single lord or\nruler had been born an aristocrat. The Qin had lasted only 15 years, so though only a few of the\nZhou aristocratic families survived into Han, but the centuries-old aristocratic idea \u2013 that only\nChapter 4, p.2 64\npeople born to old, high-ranking families deserved reverence \u2013 was still powerful and\nwidespread. Liu Bang could claim no noble lineage whatsoever. In fact, he could not remember\nhis father\u2019s name, and labelled his ancestral temple \u201cTai gong,\u201d which is just a respectful term\nfor an old man. Liu used stories of supernatural events to create a sense that Heaven\u2019s Mandate\ncould close that social gap (such as a case of clouds indicating his presence when his followers\nwere looking for him), but his generals saw themselves as his comrades and equals, if not his\nbetters. Sima Qian tells us:\nLiu Bang\u2019s followers were given to drinking and brawling over which of them\nhad accomplished the most in the conquest. When in their cups, some would\nshout wildly and others would draw their swords and hack at the pillars of the\npalace. Liu Bang became distressed over their behavior.\nSensing an opportunity, a Confucian, Shusun Tong (after changing out of his distinctive\nConfucian garb, since Liu Bang was known to pee into the hats of Confucians), suggested that he\nand others from Confucius\u2019s home state of Lu design some court rituals to tame the generals.\nLiu Bang hesitated. He already had advisors who were fiscal experts, military experts,\nengineering experts, experts in interpreting omens, experts in health, experts in calendrical\ncalculations of lucky and unlucky days, and so on. These were practical skills. Not only had\nmany Confucians supported Liu\u2019s rival, Xiang Yu, but also, they were generally known as\neccentrics who wore antique clothing and practiced ancient rituals. A follower of Mozi\ndescribed them this way:\nThey bedeck themselves with elaborate dress\u2026 They strum and sing and beat out\ndance rhythms to gather disciples. They proliferate rites\u2026 to display their\ndecorum. They labor over the niceties of ceremonial gaits and flapping gestures\nto impress people.3\nSo Liu Bang hesitated. He asked, \u201cCan you make the rituals not too difficult?\u201d Shusun Tong\nreassured him (taking a leaf out of the Legalists\u2019 book): \u201cThe five emperors of antiquity all had\ndifferent types of court music and dance; the three founders of the Shang, Zhou and Xia\ndynasties did not follow the same ritual\u2026 They did not merely copy their predecessors. I intend\nto pick a number of ancient rituals and some Qin ceremonies, to make a combination of these.\u201d\n\u201cWell, see what you can do!\u201d said the emperor. \u201cBut make it easy to learn! Keep in\nmind that it must be the sort of thing I can handle.\u201d\nShusun and thirty scholars from Lu worked out some rituals and practiced for a month.\nThen they called the emperor in to watch. \u201cI can do that all right!\u201d said Liu Bang. He and all the\ngenerals and officials practiced their roles. At the New Year formal audience, every man\ntrembled with awe and reverence; during the feast, no-one dared to quarrel or misbehave. Liu\nBang declared \u201cToday, for the first time, I know how exalted a thing it is to be an emperor.\u201d\nConfucian scholars had won a toehold at the Han court \u2013 a toehold, not much more, as we will\nsee in Chapter Five.\nArchitecture, ritual, and clothing differentiated the emperor from other humans in every\nsphere of life. He lived in the inmost part of a large walled palace in the capital, with his\nconsorts and family. Eunuchs and palace women served them. Special gateways and towers\nChapter 4, p.3 65\nsymbolized his power, and isolated him; officials could visit only the outer part of the palace.\nSpecialists prepared his food and he ate alone, solemnly served with many more dishes than he\nneeded, in a set order. Even his sexual relations were ritualized and overseen by eunuchs and\nofficials. The emperor\u2019s clothing was unique to him; he had to wear certain robes at certain times\nof year and for particular ceremonies, and the robes were of ritually prescribed cloth and color,\nwith embroidered symbols. He spent much of his time as cosmic intermediary, preparing for or\ncarrying out sacrifices to Heaven (after about 40 BC), Earth, Soil and Grain, stars, weather-\nforces, imperial ancestors, etc. Emperor and Empress together carried out purifying rituals,\nfertility rituals, cosmological rituals, and ceremonies of investing officials with authority.\nSometimes they traveled to sacred sites to worship important mountains.\nEmpresses\nSima Qian wrote that \u201cThe bond between husband and wife is the most solemn of\nrelationships.\u201d He gave historical examples of how wives had helped dynastic founders, and of\nhow rulers who slighted aging wives to favor concubines had lost their thrones.4 He thought Liu\nBang and his wife L\u00fc Exu a fit couple: Both were uneducated and unrefined, prone to cruelty\nwhen afraid, but Empress L\u00fc\u2019s strength, resolve, and good judgement had helped Liu Bang\nestablish stability. As they aged, Liu favored Beauty Qi and leaned toward making her son heir\napparent in place of L\u00fc\u2019s son, who was younger. In the end, as the son of the primary wife, L\u00fc\u2019s\nson ascended the throne as Emperor Hui. His mother married Hui to her granddaughter (Hui\u2019s\nsister\u2019s child), but the couple had no children, and Hui died at 28. Two of his sons by\nconcubines succeeded him, but they were babies.

He commented that under\nher:\nthe common people succeeded in putting behind them the sufferings of the age of\nthe Warring States, and ruler and subject alike sought rest in non-action (wu-wei).\nTherefore Emperor Hui sat with folded hands and unruffled garments, Empress\nL\u00fc as a female ruler conducted the business of government without ever leaving\nher private chambers, and the world was at peace. Punishments were seldom\nmeted out and evildoers grew rare. The people devoted themselves to planting and\nharvesting, and food and clothing became increasingly abundant.5\nEmpress L\u00fc was a legitimate authority. She was legitimate as wife and partner to her\nhusband, and as mother and generational superior to her son and grandsons. She had earned\nauthority because it was widely recognized that she had helped in the conquest \u2013 a family\nenterprise like any other \u2013 and she earned more authority because she ruled well. As ruler, she\nissued edicts and communiques to foreign regimes in her own name, and stamped them with fine\njade seals carved with dragons and tigers \u2013 a kind of seal supposed to be used only by the\nemperor. She openly received officials herself, and got a copy of every report submitted to the\nemperor. She oversaw some important measures, including lifting the Qin ban on books of\npolitical theory, so there could be free debate. Officials of all kinds worked for her, and the\ngovernment ran smoothly. Nonetheless, she had enemies at court.\nWhen Empress L\u00fc died, her opponents killed almost all her relatives, and deposed the L\u00fc\nemperor she had designated, reclaiming the throne for the Liu family. But her daughter-in-law\nEmpress Dou reigned with her husband Emperor Wen, and as regent for her son Emperor Jing,\nand her grandson Emperor Wu (Wudi) when he was young. Wudi reigned for 53 years (more on\nhim below), but later emperors were mostly children dominated by their mothers and their\nChapter 4, p.5 67\nmothers\u2019 families, officials, or eunuchs. The Han court was rife with accusations of witchcraft\nand murderous factional struggle. A clan that lost a bid to provide the empress might well be\nexterminated. For example, a triumvirate running child emperor Zhao\u2019s government (r.87-74),\nincluded Huo Guang. Huo married his daughter to the emperor and packed the upper\nbureaucracy with his family. When the next emperor chose an empress from a different family,\nthe Huos poisoned her and put in another Huo daughter. In the end, public opinion turned\nagainst the Huos, and the whole clan was wiped out.\nMap G: The Han empire at its greatest extent, about 50 BC, with peoples and places mentioned in the text.\nChapter 4, p.6 68\nThe Bureaucracy\nBut while Huo was in office, he had made decisions about governing.6 In Han times,\ndynastic property was distinguished from public, government property, and most governance\nwas in the hands of the bureaucracy. Recruitment of government officials in Han times was\nnominally, and in practice partly, meritocratic. Senior officials in the commanderies and\nkingdoms were ordered to send talented or virtuous men to the capital for evaluation and\nappointment. Initially this was an ad hoc proceeding, but by about 50 BC there was a set quota:\nfor every 200,000 inhabitants, the governor of a commandery (a group of counties) was to send\nin one candidate who was locally admired for his virtue and filiality and 6 to 10 who understood\nliterature. Upon arrival at the capital, the recommended men went through some kind of\nassessment, possibly an examination testing reading and writing. Those who passed joined a pool\nof men \u2013 at times a thousand of them \u2013 awaiting appointment to a vacant position. When a post\nopened up, one would be appointed, perhaps assigned duties in a capital ministry of the central\ngovernment, perhaps sent out thousands of miles away to take over a county.\nThe officials of the central government consulted with the emperor or empress to\ndetermine policy. Along with senior advisors, two top officials coordinated government,\nreceiving reports from below (memorials) and sending out orders (edicts) in the emperor\u2019s name\nto manage the nine ministries and numerous smaller offices that made up the structure of\ngovernment. The ministries were responsible for: superintending the imperial household; setting\nup and carrying out sacrifices to the various deities and ancestors, observing stars and other\nastronomical phenomena and creating the calendar to regulate agricultural production; writing\nlaw and administering punishments for crime; foreign relations; collecting and recording tax\nrevenue; maintaining granaries, armories and treasuries; determining expenditures on public\nworks projects, defense and other so on; and maintaining records of the hundreds of members of\nthe imperial family with their titles and lands and the degrees of precedence. These were the\ncentral ministries.\nThe whole territory of the empire as it was conquered was divided, eventually, into about\n100 commanderies and about 1300 counties headed by a centrally-appointed magistrate, who in\nturn appointed officials to assist in managing the 10,000 to 2,000,000 people of a county.\nCounty magistrates, closely supervised by the central government, arrested and punished\ncriminals, deserters, and those who sheltered them, according to the standard legal code;\ncollected a standard amount of tax in grain, cloth and cash; called up labor gangs as needed for\npublic works; drafted soldiers; maintained roads, canals, and granaries; and kept up the postal\nsystem so that orders and reports could go back and forth from locality to capital.\nAll together, the Han government included about 130,000 bureaucrats on salary \u2013 ten\ntimes the number of officials in the contemporaneous Roman empire \u2013 plus their staffs of 10-20\nmen, also on salary. Officials were promoted and demoted on the basis of their achievements\nand honesty. They were paid according to the rank of their post, in grain, silk, cash. They rested\none day in five, and could take sick leave; those who served for a long time might get a pension.\nThey were also rewarded with high-status displays, since they represented imperial authority.\nEach rank had a set color for its special robes and caps. Their offices were large compounds of\nbuildings, walled and symmetrically arranged. Their comings and goings were marked by bells\nChapter 4, p.7 69\nand drums, and the streets were cleared for them to pass. They interacted with one another\naccording to strict rules of protocol, and were entitled to deference from the population, and to\nrespect from the emperor as well. These rituals at the county level echoed those at court, and\ncontinued, with variations, throughout the imperial period.\nSince the government was a public possession, no longer held by feudal lords, the\nconcept of \u201ccorruption\u201d \u2013 taking what belonged to the public, or unjustly deciding criminal cases\n\u2013 became thinkable. Many officials benefited from opportunities to corruptly feather their own\nnests \u2013 especially in the southern port of today\u2019s Guangzhou, far from central control, and which\nwelcomed a maritime trade in pearls, rhinoceros horns, sea turtles, and elephant tusks and other\nexotic goods. Port officials in the south, far from capital control, could profit immensely. But\nother officials wore themselves out in the service of government, allowing the Han to last for 400\nyears despite shenanigans at court.\nHan continued the Legalist ideology of equality before the law (except for the royal\nfamily), as well as its harsh punishments. In 206, having taken the capital, Liu Bang announced:\nElders, you have long endured the brutal Qin laws. The entire families of those\nconvicted of slandering the emperor were killed, and those convicted of plotting\nwere executed \u2026 [Now] the Law will have only three sections: one who kills\nanother will die, and one who harms another or steals will pay recompense for the\ncrime. The rest of the Qin laws are all done away with.7\nSuch simple laws, however, could not possibly manage a whole empire, so in 195 BC, the Qin\ncode was restored, with just a few changes. Likewise, thirty years later, Emperor Wen replaced\nFig 4.3 Latter Han silk textile woven with animals climbing cloudlike mountains and textual inscription\nhonoring the lord of a palace.

Public Domain.\nChapter 4, p.8 70\nmutilating punishments \u2013 facial tattooing, cutting off the nose, or amputating a foot or hand \u2013\nwith beating or penal labor. The change boosted his reputation, but in fact more people died\nfrom beatings than from the older punishments. Still, in contrast with the feudal distinctions by\nrank at birth, the law applied to all.\nCommoners could petition about mistreatment by officials. A government branch called\nthe Censorate or Ministry of Investigation kept an eye on all branches of government, up to and\nincluding the emperor himself. Justice for commoners could even be upheld against the\nemperor himself. One day, Emperor Wen\u2019s cortege was passing, so a commoner hid under a\nbridge to obey the law that the roads be clear. Unfortunately, he popped up before the carriage\nhad passed and startled the horses. Emperor Wen told the Minister of Justice to handle the case,\nbut when the minister only levied a fine, the emperor angrily demanded a heavier punishment: he\nmight have been hurt! The minister insisted that he had to follow the law. If the emperor could\ncommand an official to override the legal process, everyone would hear of it and they would no\nlonger respect the law themselves.\nCommoners\nLiu Bang\u2019s first act upon taking Xianyang was to secure the empire\u2019s population registers.\nAs the territories of Chu, the Yue kingdoms of the southwest, and the northern peninsula were\nconquered, new commoners were registered as in Qin times, on slips of bamboo that excavations\nsince the 1980s have been turning up. People who had to leave home to escape flood or famine\nwere initially required to return, but from about 50 BC, Han policy encouraged them to settle\ndown in the new location. Han also moved large groups of people to settle in newly-conquered\nareas. State power over land and labor was real, and local communities were being broken up.\nThe Qin and Han regimes invested a lot of energy in fiscal and legal uniformity. But not\ncultural. When Qin defeated the other states, it outlawed their currencies, scripts, and laws, but\nthe facsimiles of each palace in Xianyang symbolically incorporated them, and historian Mark\nEdward Lewis has argued that the glory of empire was thought to lie precisely in the variety it\nincorporated. The Han left local marriage and burial practices, cults, lifeways, and languages\nalone. Elite families shared written language, literature, and other lifeways, but as historian\nCharles Holcombe puts it, \u201cThe Qin and Han dynasties were both therefore significantly\nmulticultural and multiethnic empires.\u201d8\nMost commoners faced a life of unending toil just to feed and clothe the family, and\nproduce a little extra to buy iron and salt and other necessities. And then there were taxes.\nHistorians disagree on how heavy the tax burden really was in the first part of the period. Land\ntaxes were lowered from Qin rates, so that by 155 BC a farming couple paid only 1/30th of the\ncrop, plus a tax in cloth. Each adult also owed demanding labor service \u2013 work on roads, canals,\nimperial tombs, and other state infrastructure; pregnant women and nursing mothers were\nexempt for three years. Until 31 BC, the state also demanded military service from each adult\nman; then the draft was commuted to a fee. Merchants without land \u2013 who throve in Han times,\nengaged in all kinds of trade \u2013 paid a set amount of tax per person, plus taxes on sales. Artisans\npaid income tax. Some argue that the state collected more than it really needed, so the emperor\ncould improve his reputation from time to time by tax amnesties.\nChapter 4, p.9 71\nMill: Grindstone and grain-pounder.\nHouse with courtyard and people.\nSheep-pen with six rams.\nStove with ?chimney.\nChapter 4, p.10 72\nWellhead and bucket.\nFig. 4.4 Han grave goods, made of clay, each about six inches to a foot high or wide. Source:\nMetropolitan Museum of Art. Public Domain.\nUsing that public funding, the Han state took a number of measures to support the small\nworking families it relied on. The government provided some famine relief in times of starvation,\nso that farmers would not have to sell their land to survive. It provided seed grain when needed.\nSymbolically and ritually, the emperor signaled the importance of farming with a spring plowing\nceremony, and the empress ceremonially wove to honor textile production. Magistrates honored\nand rewarded farmers in seasonal ceremonies, and productive farmers were granted rank in the\nlower rungs of the 20-rank system. Some farmers even won the right to travel on the special lane\nin the middle of highways that was reserved for the use of the emperor, carrying a staff with a\nbird on top to signal their right to be there. Central regulations forbade officials to demand labor\nduring busy farming seasons. And magistrates managed public markets, so that farmers could\nsell extra grain or cloth or vegetables or meat and buy manufactured things they needed \u2013 salt, oil,\niron tools.\nArtisans, as well as contributing labor service, could earn wages in private or state workshops.\nPrivate factories made ale, processed food, leather, silk cloth, dye, lumber, pottery, bronze\nmirrors and other items (sometimes with fake state \u2018brand names\u2019), iron tools, carts and carriages,\nlacquerware dishes, etc. In state workshops, some weaving was done by men, but many artisans\nmaking luxury goods like silk and lacquer were women; the high wages supposedly made them\nreluctant to marry.\nThe active participation of commoners in all areas of manufacturing and the state freed up\nhuman creativity. Han inventions and developments of earlier practices included some that\nmuch later spurred the world\u2019s creation of the modern formation of mass production based on\nmineral energy. We all know about paper and the north-pointing compass, but Han people also\nfigured out, among many other things, how to drill deep into the earth for salt water (as the\npicture shows), pump it up into shallow pans, and make salt by piping up the natural gas in those\nsame wells and using it to boil off the water.\nWhat do you think is going on here?:\nChapter 4, p.11 73\nFig. 4.5 Rubbing of Han-era representation of deep drilling for natural gas and salt brine. The gas, in\nbamboo pipes, was used to boil off the water and create salt, which people needed for food preservation\nand for nutrition. Source: Robert Temple, The Genius of China, p. 57. Fair Use.\nPeople made goods at home, in private workshops, or in state factories where labor was\ndivided, with each worker specializing in one stage of production. This principle was adopted by\nJosiah Wedgewood (1730-1795) as a cornerstone of Britain\u2019s industrial revolution, and was\nmade more efficient by American automobile producers through the use of the moving assembly\nline. The conveyor belt that made the assembly line possible was a development of another Han\ninvention, the chain-pump used for irrigation, which was developed into a power-transmitting\nchain drive in Song times, and then eventually into the conveyor belt.*\nCommoners indeed had great opportunities in early Han times. Ordinary men all cycled\nthrough the army doing a year of training and a year of service, and that gave them the\nopportunity to learn to read and write, if they were so inclined. Orders were conveyed in writing\nand posted on walls, and a man who was intrigued by writing, or desperately bored by the tedium\nof garrison life, could begin to put together the written texts, posted on walls, with the orders as\nread out by officers. He could also find an officer to teach him a bit. Indeed, as the state\ncommunicated with everyone in written order that were read aloud, the same dynamic probably\nled to a fairly good literacy rate. Letters by commoners that reveal a command of the written\nlanguage have been excavated in the dry northwestern portions of the Han empire.9\n*Temple, The Genius of China. This book presents, with lots of pictures, some findings of the enormous multi-\nvolume project began by Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China, available in English and Chinese.\nChapter 4, p.12 74\nIf known for their learning and virtue, men from ordinary families could be\nrecommended for office. Meritocracy \u2013 for perhaps a century and a half \u2013 was real. Nobodies\nsometimes rose dramatically. An example is one Gong Yu. He was a farmer who tilled 130 mou\n(1 mou is about .2 of an acre, but it varies a lot) of land, valued at less than 10,000 copper cash.\nBut he also studied and earned respect for his learning, and was recommended for office. In\norder to pay for the trip to the capital, he had to sell all but 30 mou of his land, but his first,\nmiddle-ranking post paid 9,200 cash per month. Gong Yu won promotions until he earned\n12,000 cash per month, more than the whole value of his original farm.10 Men who rose from\nrags to riches under Emperor Wu include a swineherd who only began to study the Classics at\nthe age of 40, but was then selected for high office; a vagabond who worked for a general and\ncame up with a plan for eliminating the remaining feudal kingdoms; a shepherd who earned\nenough money to help substantially with the Xiongnu war (see below) and was rewarded with\noffice; and a shopkeeper\u2019s son who was put in charge of provisioning the army. He represented\nthe court in a famous debate with Confucians, who opposed the government monopolies on salt\nand iron that were funding the war. Women, too, could rise: Wudi married, and raised to\nprimary wife and empress, a singer and dancer who was the daughter of a slave.\nEnslaved People\nFor there were indeed slaves in Qin and Han society. Some were owned by the\ngovernment, others privately. Some criminals and their families became government slaves;\nsometimes the families were pardoned after a dozen years or more. An executed criminal\u2019s\nfamily and even their descendants might be permanently enslaved, their faces tattooed. Other\ngovernment slaves were war captives, or had been offered as tribute. Aged government slaves\nwere sometimes freed, sometimes cared for, but sometimes sold or resold to private owners. The\ngovernment confiscated the slaves of criminals along with other property. Government slaves\nworked mainly in dangerous places like mines and iron foundries. Gong Yu \u2013 the farmer turned\nhigh official \u2013 in 44 BC decried the fact that 100,000 convicts were at work in such government\nenterprises.11 One historian wrote, \u201cForced labor was the foundation of the Qin and Han\nstates.\u201d12\nPrivately-owned slaves were those who had been sold or had sold themselves when\nfamilies were starving, or who were kidnapped and sold illegally. The famine and destruction\nthat attend war often brought enslavement for children; in 205 BC, Liu Bang permitted people to\nsell their children (or move to Sichuan) for food, and three years later he declared all such people\nfree again. Children might also be pawned, and if not redeemed within three years would become\nslaves; or they could be put up as collateral for a loan and be lost that way. A child born to two\nslave parents was enslaved from birth, but it is not clear whether just one enslaved parent made\nthe child a slave. Private slaves could be freed or buy themselves out of slavery, but stealing\nthem was a crime. Some merchants specialized in training youngsters as singers and dancers and\nselling them, and some sources report young slaves dressed up in silk and displayed for sale in\npens. In one case \u201cseveral tens\u201d of these were sent for sale together. Freed slaves were\ncommoners, with no permanent taint. Han slaves included Koreans, Iranians, Turks, Tibetans,\nUighurs; and Han subjects were sold as slaves in foreign countries.13\nHan commoners fell into slavery in part because of state monopolies on iron and salt\n(why would salt be a good government monopoly?), and because they were required to pay the\n\u201cpoll tax\u201d \u2013 a per capita fixed tax \u2013 in cash. Farmers could not easily raise cash. Since the main\nChapter 4, p.13 75\ncrops in any place come ripe at the same time, if sold on the market then they are worth little.\nThe monopolies and cash poll tax, squeezing smallholders, were introduced at the same time as a\ntax on wealth (not income) that taxed goods at twice the rate of land. Wealthy families were\nlooking to convert other kinds of wealth into land. They quickly bought up the fields of their\ndesperate poorer neighbors, and even their children. Those families now had to work for others.\nHigh taxes compromised the Han fiscal base and its political claim to be supporting smallholders.\nAnd why did Emperor Wu want all that tax money? To fight the Xiongnu.\nThe Silk Roads and the Xiongnu War\nTo understand the origins of the immensely expensive Han-Xiongnu war, we have to go\nback a bit. Travel and trade across the steppe highway of Central Asia had intensified from\nabout the middle of the fourth century BC when Alexander the Great (356 \u2013 323), of Macedonia\nin Northern Greece, conquered Central Asia and northern India. Connections stretched across\nEurasia. Once the Han had established peace in the former Qin territory, millions of workers,\nmainly women, settled down to weaving the lush, patterned silks the rest of Eurasia desired.\nFig. 4.6 Model of watchtower. Han burial item. Earthenware with green lead glaze, about a yard high. It\nlooks as if one of the guards has a cross-bow. Source: Metropolitan Museum of Art. Public Domain.\nIt was not an irreconcilable culture clash between steppe and sown that led to the Han\nconflict with the Xiongnu. Rather, as with the Rong, the Di, and the Hu in the Zhou period, the\ntwo sides were very much operating in the same political world. Although nomads moved\naround more than farmers, taking herds to new pastures every year or season, in other ways their\nproductive lives were similar to the Shang and early Zhou, and to much of Han territory before\ncentral government really took hold. Life centered on kinfolk and clans or tribes for production,\nmigration, and war. A stratified aristocracy dominated farming and herding commoners.\nMounted aristocrats led war and large hunts; others might fight just to raid a neighboring tribe.\nSuccession to tribal leadership was hereditary, but rather than the first son, the heir was the son\nwith the widest popular and aristocratic support, based on proven success in leadership. The\nbalance of production and consumption on the steppe was so delicate that even high-ranking\npeople had to work, like the elite in Shang times.\nChapter 4, p.14 76\nSteppe people did rely more on animals for food than their sedentary neighbors, but the\nsteppe economy also included grain, crafts, and trade. Meanwhile, just like nomads, Han\nsubjects did consume meat and dairy products, and Han doctors considered milk a medicine,\ngood for digestion, and urged patients to consume dairy foods every day. One early Han\nmanuscript says that fermented mare\u2019s milk lengthened life.14 What Han people did not eat\nmuch, above the Huai River line, were rice, fish, and other water-based foods. Those foods\ncharacterized the small percentage of the Han population living in the south.\nThe key difference between the Xiongnu and Han regimes lay in their political structure:\nconfederation of tribes versus centralized empire. The first record of the nomadic Xiongnu (we\ndo not know what language they spoke, by the way) comes when they joined a horizontal\nalliance of the five eastern Zhou states against Qin in 318 BC. In 214 BC, Qin General Meng\nTian led an enormous army to capture the Ordos region, a flourishing Xiongnu center of trade\nand pastureland they needed for production. To consolidate the territory he captured, he built a\nGreat Wall (not the one we know today). At the same time, nomads from the east were also\nattacking the Xiongnu. In defense against this twin threat, the tribes formed a confederation.\nFig 4.7 In this rubbing of a scene decorating a tomb, people are milking a cow, a goat, and a mare. One\nhas a small problem with the horse, despite extra precautions. On the far left, a filial son is offering his\naged mother a cup of milk. How do we know she is old?15\nThere was a standard way to do this in nomadic society: one man, accepted as khan,\ncreates an honor guard of top warriors (kesig) that support him; a council of aristocrats called\n\u201ckings,\u201d with their own fiefs and troops; and an army under his control to stop internal fighting,\nsubordinate surrounding peoples, and collect tribute in both prestige luxury goods and staples\nlike grain. The khan distributes that tribute to his royal clan and close supporters, who pass some\non to their dependents. In this case, to coordinate defense against Qin and the eastern Yuezhi,\nthe chiefs ceded some authority to a khan named Modun (r. 209-174), who claimed a divine\nmandate. With an existential threat behind them and the promise of loot before them, the\nXiongnu troops, under this centralized command, retook the territory Qin had taken. Aided by\nthe fall of Qin, they kept going until they had conquered as far east as the Liaodong Peninsula,\nand as far west as today\u2019s Shaanxi.\nRecall that Liu Bang, the Han founder, had initially set up some independent \u201ckingdoms\u201d\nor fiefs to settle kin and allies. In 198 BC, one of those kingdoms (confusing called Hann),\nunder attack by the Xiongnu confederation, decided to ally with the confederation. Liu Bang\npersonally led 320,000 infantrymen to suppress the rebellious kingdom and attack Xiongnu, but\nthey trounced him. The Hann kingdom joined in raiding imperial Han territory. To try to keep\npeace along the border, Liu Bang and his successors recognized the Xiongnu as a military\nsuperior and political equal. One ruled the settled people who wore hats and sashes; the other\nruled \u201cthe people who draw the bow.\u201d Since plenty of Han people also drew bows, and anyone\nChapter 4, p.15 77\ncan put on a hat and a sash, you can see that this was not a deep-seated ethnic distinction. The\ntwo sides created a marriage alliance, meaning that children were descended from both. Han\npresented tribute annually of silk and other cloth, millet, gold, and other goods. The two sides\nrecognized the Qin Long Wall as the border between their territories, and respected one\nanother\u2019s larger spheres of influence over smaller states and tribes.\nWhat Modun and his successor khans needed to hold authority and keep the confederacy\ntogether was a steady flow of goods to pass down to their followers. The khan\u2019s authority over\nthe chiefs extended only to coordinating warfare; he could not stop Han defectors and lesser\nnomad chiefs from raiding. The Han side understood that quite clearly. They opened more\nmarkets along the border, ignored smuggling, and kept the tribute flowing no matter what, along\nwith other signs of authority. They hoped to strengthen the khan enough that he could maintain\nthe bipolar world with its clear line of division. Yet, as historian Nicola di Cosmo puts it, \u201cno\namount of Chinese support could change the core structure of nomadic society.\u201d\nFig. 4.8 Xiongnu metal plaque depicting two animals fighting (can you tell what they are?), c. 150 BC.\nSource: Museum of Far East Antiquities in Stockholm. Public Domain.\nThe Xiongnu, on the other hand, did force change on Han. Since defense to the north\nrequired skilled cavalry, in 31 BC the Han ended a keystone policy of legalist government, the\nuniversal male draft, and hired professional soldiers from the border areas. The hired soldiers, in\nat least fifty cases in Eastern Han times, not only worked along the borders, but put down\ninternal rebellions; in half of those cases, all the troops involved were from the steppe.16\nThe mutual recognition agreement between Han and the Xiongnu confederation lasted\nfrom 198 to 133 BC. Han emperor Wu (Wudi) violated the treaty by sending an official, Zhang\nQian, to make an alliance with another nomadic group in 139 BC; the understanding that this\nwas his sphere of influence accounts for the Xiongnu khan\u2019s great rage when Zhang was\nintercepted. The khan wrote to the Han court in outrage: \u201cThe Yuezhi lie to the north of us \u2013\nhow can the Han send their envoys there? If I wished to send envoys to Viet [in the far south],\nwould the Han allow me to do so?\u201d The Xiongnu held Zhang Qian for 10 years. He spent the\ndecade learning all he could about Central Asia, so that when he finally escaped he was able to\ntravel to present-day Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan, bringing back to the Han court in\nChapter 4, p.16 78\n126 BC word of the outside world as far as Rome \u2013 and in particular of the vast potential market\nfor Chinese silks. Meanwhile, frustrated with the constant raids coming on top of tribute\npayments, Wudi launched a series of attacks on the Xiongnu, initially presented as defensive.\nAs the war continued, Wudi sent soldiers ever further west. He saw that until he\ncontrolled the trade routes across Central Asia, the Xiongnu could always be resupplied and keep\nfighting. So, over the objections of courtiers, Wudi sent troops right through the Gobi Desert up\nto Ulan Bator in Mongolia, and eventually set up military commanderies and civil counties in the\noases that had supplied the Xiongnu. Supplying the troops was difficult and stupid leaders did\nnot help: one commander insisted on setting up a kickball field (the game was used for training),\neven though his troops were hungry.17 Settlers from inside Han were sent out West from about\n60 BC onwards.18 The war cost hundreds of thousands of lives and horses, and about 189 trillion\ncopper cash. Wudi raised it through new taxes on merchant inventories, and government\nmonopolies on mining, on minting cash, and on making and selling iron, salt, and alcohol.\nFig 4.9 Handle in the form of a dragon that looks like a horse. Latter Han dynasty, gilt-bronze with traces\nof red pigment, about six inches long. Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nConfucian officials like Jia Yi and Sima Qian opposed not only the spending of that cash\non war but also the way monopolies undermined free trade and hurt ordinary families.\nEnvisioning a society built on strong married couples, they opposed both the hiring of young\nwomen to work in government silk factories and the expenditure of manpower on the Wudi\u2019s\nnever-ending military campaigns. The first pulled young women away from the family by\nallowing them to delay marriage, living on their wages; and the second pulled young men away\nfrom the family by sending them out into the deserts to fight.19 Wudi paid no attention.\nOutflanking the Xiongnu on the East\nAs we have seen, an early Han fief or kingdom had initiated the war by defecting to the\nXiongnu. A similar occurrence on the peninsula kicked off a very slow process of political\ndevelopment. There, a large number of tribes lived in relative peace, if for no other reason than\nthat bronze and iron \u2013 with their superior capacity for wounding and killing \u2013 arrived there\ntogether only in about 300 BC. Before the Qin unification, Chos\u014fn was one of a number of\ntribes northeastern of today\u2019s Beijing, near the state of Yan. The Chos\u014fn people were defeated\nby Qin, but not eliminated.\nChapter 4, p.17 79\nIn 195 BC, a Han feudal king in Yan allied with a Xiongnu leader. One of the king\u2019s\nsubordinates, Wei Man (Wi Man in Korean), headed northeast (the precise location is debated).\nHe worked for the Chos\u014fn chief, and then took over in 180 BC. This regime, called \u201cWiman\nChos\u014fn,\u201d provided a haven for Han dissidents, and played middleman in trade and diplomatic\nrelations between the Han empire (perhaps represented by a small office in the Liaodong\npeninsula) and the various tribes of Manchuria (including the Xiongnu) and the Korean\npeninsula.\nWudi could not tolerate a power-broker supplying the Xiongnu from the east, so in 109\nBC, he sent one army across the Bohai Sea and one overland to attack the capital of Chos\u014fn. Wi\nMan\u2019s grandson, Ug\u014f, by strength and guile, held off the Han army and navy for over a year.\nThen a second campaign and Ugo\u2019s murder by his own ministers brought Han victory. The\ndynasty had lasted 72 years: far longer than united Qin. This is the first regime we know of in\nthe Korean peninsula and Manchuria. It was only later in Han times that writers claimed the\neasternmost part of Chos\u014fn as Kija\u2019s refuge after the Zhou conquest, and later historians added\ndetail after detail to extend Chos\u014fn history backwards.20 This is a clear sign of myth: for how\ncould later ages know more than earlier ones, before scientific archaeology?\nThe Han Commanderies on the Peninsula\nTo incorporate the area, Han set up commanderies in the northern peninsula in 108 BC, at\nthe same time as in Vietnam and in Xiongnu territory. Two of the commanderies lasted only 25\nyears, but Lelang became the center of the vibrant trade Wudi wished to control, a Yellow Sea\ntrading circuit formed a century or so earlier.21 The trade ran from the southern peninsula far up\ninto Manchuria, which produced hardwoods, furs, fish, salt, and grain; by land to the mainland\nand the steppe route to the Middle East and Europe; and by sea over to the archipelago (a short\nhop by boat) and along the coast of the mainland to southeast Asia. Individuals rarely travelled\nthe whole way (although one Chinese emissary, Ganying, did go to the Persian Gulf); but objects,\ntechniques for making them, and sometimes the ideas behind them, crossed the whole of Eurasia.\nIndian and Roman coins, beads, rings, and so on have been found in Vietnam from at least the\nsecond century AD, and Roman glass has been found in Silla tombs on the peninsula from about\n500 AD.22 Gold, flowered Silla-style crowns have been found in Afghanistan. And once paper\nwas invented (some time before 80 BC), it passed to the Middle East and then Europe, so that by\nthe twelfth century paper was being made in Moorish Spain...23\nBut that is getting ahead of the story. The point is that Korea was in the middle of an\nactive and far-flung mercantile network. Lelang\u2019s purpose for the Han government may have\nbeen not only to outflank the Xiongnu, but also to protect its state monopoly of salt and iron,\nwhich the peninsula\u2019s boatmen threatened by their coastal trade.\nOnce under Han control, Lelang people produced silk, lacquerware, and jewelry, and\nmade carriages out of parts imported from the mainland. In exchange for raw materials, Lelang\nprovided local chiefs with prestige goods, especially bronze mirrors (originally a steppe product,\nremember?, but by now thoroughly identified with elite Chinese culture).\nThe commanderies on the peninsula were ruled much like the rest of the empire: with\nofficials appointed by the center and local staff members, who counted and registered people and\ndemanded taxes and labor service. Some household registers on wood tablets have been\nexcavated. According to the census of Lelang in 45 BC, about 15% of the population had\nChapter 4, p.18 80\nrecently come from the mainland. The Han government did not treat mainlanders better; in fact,\nlocals received preferential treatment, placing groups of 30-40 households under local chiefs and\nassigning them lighter tax and labor burdens. The intent was to win acceptance of the new\ngovernment. Mainlanders intermarried with local elite families, who learned to read and write in\nChinese, and began to study the classics and write their own poems, as recent excavations have\nshown. With the advent of these writings, and the entry of the peninsula + Manchuria into\nmainland texts, we can consider c. 200 BC to AD 313 the \u201cEarly Historical Period\u201d of Korea.\nWhen Huo Guang was ruling Han in 82 BC, he retreated from Wudi\u2019s expansionist mode.\nHe closed the commandery in Vietnam and two on the peninsula, and moved the Xuantu\ncommandery to a safer location. Even before that retreat, the commanderies\u2019 control was limited\nand tenuous. The local population continued to fight. (From 25-30 AD, a local rebel took over\nLelang, and allied with others in Shandong province until Latter Han defeated them all.) To\nfight effectively, they improved both weaponry and organization: several different polities\nslowly developed. Their elite were pure warriors, who never farmed themselves, but (like the\nShang, Zhou, and Xiongnu) dominated the local farming and gathering people by force of arms.\nEarly Proto-states in the Peninsula + Manchuria\nMap H: The four main islands of the Japanese archipelago (Kyushu, Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku) and\ntiny Tsushima); the Samhan of the peninsula (Mahan, Chinhan, Pyonhan); the Lelang commandery; the\nYe and Okcho peoples; the states of Kogury\u014f and Puy\u014f; and the present-day city of Pusan for reference.\nChapter 4, p.19 81\nFarthest north, in the Sungari River valley of Manchuria, was Puy\u014f, which had formed in\nreaction against expansion by the state of Yan in about 300 BC.24 Once the commanderies were\nset up in 108 BC, Puy\u014f allied with Han. Some tribes confederated to oppose the Han-Puy\u014f\nalliance, forming Kogury\u014f around 37 BC. Kogury\u014f King T\u2019aejo (53-146?) later expanded his\nterritory, subjugating the Okcho tribes on the eastern coast of the peninsula. But as he conquered\nnew territories, he left the chiefs in place to rule the local people; he did not create a centralized\nstate.\nTo the south were three loose confederations dating back to about 100 BC: Mahan,\nChinhan, and Py\u014fnhan: together, the Samhan (\u201cThree Han\u201d \u4e09\u97d3). Mahan\u2019s 54 named towns lay\nimmediately south of the Lelang commandery, on the western coast of the peninsula. It had the\nrichest farmlands. Chinhan\u2019s 12 towns lay on the southeastern coast, and Py\u014fnhan\u2019s dozen\ntowns clustered at the southern end of the peninsula. The walled towns of the three\nconfederations held about 500-1000 households (2500-5000 people). Each town\u2019s hinterland of\nfields (growing millet or rice) and wilderness averaged about 22 miles in diameter, roughly one-\nfifth of the area the late Shang kings had directly controlled.\nThe chief of each tiny town or \u201cstatelet\u201d governed independently. Many were wealthy\nenough to be buried with bronze belt hooks and mirrors, acquired through trade with the\ncommanderies, as well as iron objects. By about AD 150, the towns were rich enough to lure\nimmigrants from the commanderies (as we know from their wooden-chamber style tombs),\nwhose expertise furthered economic development and political consolidation. The Samhan\nchiefs sought and welcomed recognition from the commanderies, in the form of seals and official\nrobes and caps. Chiefs could display those status symbols to increase their social status over their\nneighbors, and recognition from Han meant the right to trade in the commanderies.25\nFig. 4.10 A excavated manuscript copy of part of The Analects, written on bamboo strips.

Fair Use.\nNot long ago, King Kwanggaeto\u2019s stele of 414 was the earliest extant Korean text. As\narchaeology progresses, however, earlier writings are being excavated, including wooden or\nChapter 4, p.20 82\nbamboo strips or tablets called\u6728\u7c21: mujian in Chinese, mokgan in Korean, mokkan in Japanese.\nThe first such texts are from the Han colonies in the northern peninsula. Most record population,\nsuch as a census of Lelang Commandery for the year 45 BC showing that under Han dynasty\ncommand there were 280,000 people in 45,000 households. But two excavated tombs have\nyielded parts of the Analects (books 11 & 12). One of the tombs held a Han royal prince, Liu\nXiu, who died in 55 BC. The North Korean government has not revealed the details of the\nsecond tomb, which held 39 strips of Analects, shown in Figure 4.10.26\nThe writing in the population registers is mainly Chinese characters, but the characters\nare used to represent Korean language in complicated ways. Aspects of Korean grammar appear\nalongside Chinese grammar, characters are used to represent sounds rather than the words they\nrepresent in Chinese, and Korean characters are created by combining or reducing Chinese\ncharacters. The later peninsular kingdoms of Silla and Paekche developed different methods of\nnotation, and both influenced Japanese writing: Paekche before 660 and Silla thereafter.27\nThe Yayoi Period on the Archipelago\nBefore you continue: can you read one or more of the characters on this seal?\nFig 4.11 Copy of rubbing of the gold seal dating to AD 57, discovered in Japan in 1784. Source: David B.\nLurie, Realms of Literacy, p. 73. Used by kind permission of the author.\nThe Lelang commandery also managed Han imperial relations with the archipelago. The\nHistory of Latter Han records an embassy from Wa, a statelet on the archipelago, in AD 57 and\none in AD 107. In 1784, a Korean farmer turned up a gold seal with a knob on top in the form of\na snake. Scholars mainly agree that it was the very seal that the Han court bestowed on Wa in 57.\nThe seal says: \u201c\u6f22\u502d\u5974\u570b\u738b Han-designated King of the Na Country of Wa.\u201d Historians do not\nknow exactly where Na or Wa were in the archipelago, \u2013 and neither did the Han government.\nBut Wa chiefs in the archipelago knew about the new Han power on the northern peninsula,\nbecause they were closely connected with tribes at the southern tip. From the northern coast of\nKyushu in Japan to Pusan in Korea is about 150 miles; from Pusan one can see Tsushima Island,\nhalfway between the two. Since at least 10,000 BC, a few people had been making the trip by\nboat, carrying jewelry and useful things in distinctive styles, like shell fishing hooks and shell\nbeads with faces carved into them.28\nIn about 600 BC (according to archaeologists) or 300 BC (according to historians), a\nregular stream of peninsular people, mainly from the far south, made the journey to Tsushima\nIsland, and then to Kyushu. They may have been escaping climate changes that had made it\nharder to grow rice in the peninsula. Over several hundred years they kept coming, settling in\nChapter 4, p.21 83\nwith the J\u014dmon people of Kyushu, intermarrying and thus sharing customs like the style of\ngraves, grave goods, enclosure of settlements by a moat, the shape of houses. They brought the\nknowledge of how to grow rice (riziculture), and they brought domesticated pigs.\nFig 4.12 Iron model of a cookstove, about 26\u201d long. From a Kogury\u014f tomb.

They made useful\nthings like large, flat, iron axeheads. They brought Kyushu the technology of enclosed\ncookstoves of clay and stone; they used less fuel than an open hearth and could heat a house with\nclay pipes that carried the smoke and heat around the inside house walls. Even a house that was\njust a pit in the ground with some kind of roof could be warmer and more comfortable with such\na hypocaust. The enclosed cookstoves made it from Kaya to northern Kyushu in the late AD\n200s.29 Some coastal communities grew enough surplus rice that their members could spare the\ntime to make extra agricultural tools \u2013 first stone, then iron \u2013 to trade further south in Kyushu.\nBy the second century AD, some Wa chiefs had formed statelets 10 to 12 miles apart\nfrom one another along the Kyushu coast. The chiefs claimed predominance over their\nneighbors with elegant, imported bronze daggers and mirrors; when imports slowed, they made\nthem in their own styles. As in the mainland New Stone Age, formerly egalitarian communities\n(shown by shared ritual bronze caches) were now dominated by local chiefs (buried with their\nown bronzes). Fighting began in Kyushu, perhaps when the various clans faced climate\nchanges.30 And trade routes to Shikoku and Honshu linked chiefs there to the goods and\ntechniques of the mainland. By AD 200, competition within communities and between statelets\nwas becoming violent. In the Late Yayoi Period (c. AD 100 to 350), one archipelago queen\nentered into diplomatic relations with the mainland, as Chapter Six will discuss.\nImmigrants from the peninsula, bearing knowledge from the mainland funneled through\nthe commanderies, made a lasting impact on the archipelago: the outermost wave of the impact\nof Wudi\u2019s war against the Xiongnu confederation.\nChapter 4, p.22 84\nSources for this chapter include S.A.

He distinguishes\nofficial and popular religion: courts set up official religion to manage large-scale problems of the\nwhole country, and all families and individuals, from emperors to slaves, practiced popular\nreligion in various ways, to pursue their own welfare: to assure a long and happy life, to avoid\nsickness and harm, and to plan for their care after death.\nMost people, regardless of their social standing, did not puzzle much about the logic of\ngods, ghosts, and demons; they simply manipulated them to attain help and ward off harm. But\nintellectuals, as Poo calls them, systematized views of the spirits and the cosmos. In particular,\nonly intellectuals \u2013 until the organized Daoism of late Han \u2013 injected ethics into the religious\nsphere, arguing (for instance) that Heaven rewarded the morally good and punished the wicked.1\nSince this small group wrote most, their views have affected how we understand ancient religion.\nThe Queen Mother of the West\nIn popular religion, high and distant places blended into spirit realms. An ordinary mortal\nmight get a peek at a paradise on earth on a high mountain or in an isolated valley.\nExtraordinary Daoists called transcendents (xian \u4ed9) who had refined their qi energy in mystical\nways could travel on clouds to the Western paradise presided over by the Queen Mother of the\nWest \u897f\u738b\u6bcd \u2014 one god in the growing Daoist pantheon, or hierarchy of gods.\nIn some form she was very old. Shang oracle bones refer to deities called Western\nMother and Eastern Mother. By the time of Confucius and Laozi, various figures were called\n\u201cQueen Mother of the West:\u201d a teacher, a directional deity, some mountain spirits, a divine\nweaver, a shaman, and a star god. The Zhuangzi lists her as a \u201cGreat Instructor,\u201d who had\nattained the Way and sat on a mythical Western Mountain. Probably each of these was a\ndifferent local spirit. The Classic of Mountains and Seas, with texts on geography, ethnography,\nand myth dating back to 400 BC, but compiled by the Han scholar Liu Xiang, says:\nTo the west is a mountain called Jade Mountain. This is the place where the\nQueen Mother of the West dwells. Her appearance is like that of a human, with a\nleopard\u2019s tail and tiger\u2019s teeth. Moreover, she is skilled at whistling. In her\ndisheveled hair she wears a sheng headdress. She presides over the constellations\n\u201cGrindstone\u201d and \u201cthe Five Sherds\u201d or \u201cFive Destructive Forces.\u201d\nHow should we understand this? The headdress may represent part of a loom or a crown of stars,\nor it may have been adopted from images of the Syrian goddess Kybele, who also sits facing\nfront, seated on a throne entwined with animal figures, and wearing a curious headdress, and\nwho is portrayed on coins from Kushan, in modern Afghanistan. Whistling represents Daoist\nbreath control. Her hair is disheveled because of the ecstatic dance of her shamanic communion\nbetween humans and spirits, and her body or costume include a leopard\u2019s tail and tiger\u2019s teeth, a\nshaman\u2019s costume representing the ability to change into or be like a powerful animal.\nChapter 5, p. 1\n\"An Outline History of East Asia to 1200, third edition\" by Sarah Schneewind is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.\nRetrieved fr om https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9d699767 86\nFigure 5.1 Eastern Han tile from Sichuan, showing the Queen Mother of the West and her companions.\nCan you identify them? Top: a rubbing of the tile. Bottom: a photograph of the tile. Public Domain.2\nChapter 5, p. 2 87\nHan Daoists brought together the Queen Mother\u2019s ancient, local, and imported\ncharacteristics. They associated her with yin, and spoke of her appearing to humans, and ruling a\nwestern paradise, while keeping her headdress and shamanist associations. Pictures show birds\nserving her; and her attendants include nine-tailed foxes, a white hare with a mortar and pestle\nfor pounding an immortality elixir, a dancing frog, a three-legged crow, a tall figure holding a\nhalberd, and sometimes with the primordial serpent-tailed brother and sister Fuxi and Nuwa.\nThe contradictions never had to be resolved. Rather, the tradition\u2019s very richness meant\nit appealed to all sorts of people. As one art historian writes, the Queen Mother of the West \u201cwas\nboth of and beyond this world; she lived in lands west of the Chinese Empire yet symbolized the\ndelights of everlasting life in an otherworldly realm of immortality, the ideal afterlife pursued by\nthe people of the Han.\u201d3 Emperor Wu (Wudi) worshipped her. He tried to attract transcendents\nfrom her paradise by constructing high buildings and an earthly paradise, including a lake that he\nconverted from its purpose of training the navy to sail multi-storied ships.4\nWealthy Han families worshipped her on altars, and wishing to enter her Western\nParadise had workmen depict her on their coffins and tombs, bronze mirrors and roof tiles. They\nportrayed her with symbols of immortality like magic mushrooms, and also with symbols of\ncosmic balance, like the sun and moon. Sometimes they paired her with the King Father of the\nEast, a late and uninteresting god invented to satisfy Han ideas of balance or even female\nsubordination. But poems portray her with no spouse, as a powerful god who dwelt in heaven,\ncontrolled other deities and access to immortality, and promised ecstatic flight through space.\nHan poet Sima Xiangru (c. 179 -117 BC) wrote of a \u201cmighty man\u201d who flew\nheavenwards in a trance:\nLooking westward to the hazy Kunlun mountains,\nI ride straight forward to the Mountain of Three Perils.\nI push though Heaven\u2019s Gate and enter the palace of Di on high\nI carry the jade maid home with me.\nStretching at Cool Wind,\nI sway, but collect myself.\nI soar high like a bird, before a sudden stop.\nHovering low over the winding yin mountains.\nI see the Queen Mother of the West today with my own eyes.\nWearing her sheng on her white hair and living in a cave,\nShe is fortunate to have a three-legged bird for errands\u20265\nAmong ordinary people, a huge millennial cult expected the imminent arrival of the\nQueen Mother of the West. Hysteria peaked in 3 BC, as reported by Ban Gu in the Han History:\nThe population was running around in a state of alarm, each person carrying a\nmanikin of straw or hemp. People exchanged these emblems with one another,\nsaying they were carrying out the advent procession. Large numbers of persons,\namounting to thousands, met in this way on the roadsides, some with disheveled\nhair or going barefoot. Some of them broke down the barriers of gates by night;\nsome clambered over walls to make their way into houses; some harnessed teams\nof horses to carriages and rode at full gallop, setting up relay states so as to\nChapter 5, p. 3 88\nconvey the tokens... to the capital. That summer the people came together in\nmeetings in the capital city and in the commanderies and kingdoms. In village\nsettlements, the lanes and paths across the fields, they held services and set up\ngaming boards for a lucky throw; and they sang and danced in worship of the\nQueen Mother of the West. They also passed around a written message saying:\n\u201cThe Mother tells the people that those who wear this talisman will not die; let\nthose who do not believe her words look below the hinges of their gates and there\nwill be white hairs there to show that this is true.\u201d6\nThis kind of popular excitement and hope for salvation was only part of what Daoism had to\noffer in Han times.\nSome highly-educated Daoists were hermits, refusing to hold office and instead\ncultivating their own spiritual and physical health. They connected Zhuangzi with shamanic\ntraditions in an ideal of communicating with awesome and beautiful nature spirits. But Daoists\nalso wielded real power at the Han court; at least as much as did Confucians. And the stories\nabout Confucius sound no less strange to us than the stories about the Queen Mother of the West.\nConfucius: Sage and Mage\nIn Han times many scholars worked to recover historical records, ritual regulations,\npoems, and other texts that had been hidden away from the Qin-Han prohibitions or destroyed\nwhen the imperial library burned down. Texts were recited from memory, retrieved from walls\nand pits, collected, edited, and compiled into the Five Classics and philosophers as we have them\ntoday. Despite this activity, Han scholars claimed that Confucius himself had written or\ncompiled and edited the Five Classics.\nConfucius, they thought, had chosen the 305 poems of the Book of Poetry from more than\n3000 in oral tradition. He had compiled the Book of Documents with its speeches from the Zhou\nconquest, its account of sage-kings Yao, Shun, and Yu, and its advice from Kija to the Zhou king.\nHe had written a commentary on the Book of Changes, which Sima Qian attributed to the Zhou\nfounder King Wen, writing in a burst of energy when released from his arrest by the Shang\nregime. His disciple Zengzi and his grandson Zisi had contributed to the three rites classics.\nAnd they thought that, as Mencius said, Confucius had compiled the Spring and Autumn\nAnnals, a terse year-by-year account of the twelve rulers of his home domain of Lu between 722\nBC and 481 BC. The Annals entries are so short, so bafflingly dull, that their existence and\ntransmission required explanation. The explanations led from Confucius being a historian, to his\nbeing an uncrowned king, a master of arcane knowledge, a prophet, and a god. Many versions of\nConfucius co-existed in Han thought, just as did many versions of the Queen Mother of the West.\nFirst, a legend arose that in recording what happened at the Lu court, where the moral\nand ritual order established by the Duke of Zhou five centuries earlier was falling apart,\nConfucius either could not (for fear of reprisal) or would not (out of loyalty to the Dukes)\nmention openly actions that reflected badly on them. So he encoded moral judgments on each\nevent he reported in very subtle wording that only good and thoughtful readers could understand.\nIt is hard to moral judgements in entries like this:\nChapter 5, p. 4 89\nAutumn: the king under heaven dispatched his minister, Xuan, to come return\ngrave gifts to the late Duke Hui and his duchess Zhongzi.\nBut according to the legend, Confucius realized that in his unpropitious time no-one could\nrestore the Way. Instead, the terse entries of the Annals recorded a whole program of\ngovernment. In code, Confucius criticized the rulers of Lu and by extension others like them,\nand turned his critique into a program for moral government. For instance, for the entry above,\nthe commentary explains\nThe use of the word \u2018return\u2019 indicates approval that is should be so. That which\nHeaven and Earth give birth to cannot be the property of a single family: Those\nwho have and those who have not should be interchangeable.7\nSince no-one could actually see a government program in the text, two commentaries drew on\noral traditions to explain what Confucius had meant, and a third text, the Zuo commentary,\n(probably not originally related to the Annals at all) told good stories about the political intrigues\nof those times.\nFurther, the existence of the Spring and Autumn Annals meant that Confucius himself\nheld the Mandate of Heaven, although it was not recognized on earth. To understand the twisted\nlogic here, we have to remember how deeply aristocratic Zhou feudal thinking had been. In the\nfeudal system, a lowly shi had no business writing a history and passing judgment on the feudal\nlords: that would have been deeply improper. But Confucius had written a history, and since he\ndefinitely would not have done anything improper, he must actually have been a ruler in the eyes\nof Heaven. Popular songs that from Lu talked about Confucius caring for the people and\nwearing royal clothing were omens that confirmed the idea of Confucius as an uncrowned king.\nBut there\u2019s more.\nTo write so subtly, Confucius must have had (Han people concluded) extraordinary\ninsight into people\u2019s actions and the cosmic Way. Stories arose demonstrating how his great\ninsight enabled him to detect causes on the basis of bizarre clues. For instance: Once Confucius\nwas in the state of Chen when another state attacked. In the course of the siege, a hawk with an\narrow shot through it landed inside a fort. Confucius identified the hawk as having come from\nvery far away, and then examined the arrow. Based on the type of wood and the style of the flint\narrowhead, he recalled that back in early Zhou, five centuries earlier, King Wu had received this\nsort of arrow from the distant Shushen people. He gave the Shushen arrows to his daughter\nwhen he married her to the first Duke of Chen. So Confucius predicted that the arrows would\nstill be there in Chen\u2019s arsenal, and he was right. This arcane knowledge came with a\nmoral/political message: Heaven must have sent the hawk to remind Chen to remember its old\nloyalty to the royal Zhou house. Confucius was an unsurpassed master of strange knowledge\nthat gave clues to great mysteries.\nFor someone who can see great mysteries in small things, it is no trick to foretell the\nfuture, since the future, like the past, moves in patterned ways. Confucius was credited with\ncompiling the Book of Changes, which was used for divination. In Han times, stories arose in\nwhich Confucius foretold what would happen, and the greatest of his prophecies was the rise of\nthe Han empire itself. The Han victory had shocked many people, because Liu Bang, whose\nChapter 5, p. 5 90\nsocial status was even lower than that of Confucius, not only overthrew the great Qin empire\n(whose ruler had been a Zhou duke), but also defeated the aristocrat Xiang Yu. To have foretold\nso surprising an event three centuries earlier would have been awesome, indeed.\nAn awesome human is not much different from a god, in the old, pre-ethical East Asian\nway of thinking that in Japan, after the arrival of Buddhism, was labelled \u201cthe Way of the\nspirits/gods\u201d or Shinto (\u795e\u9053). His extraordinary insight and prophecies made Confucius a god.\nA story grew up that Confucius\u2019s mother had become pregnant after praying to a local hill god,\nor that she had dreamed of meeting a \u201cBlack Lord\u201d in a dream; or that his birth was announced\nby black ravens that were the totem of the Shang royal clan, or that he was found in a hollow\nmulberry tree, also associated with the Shang. The birth was painless, and yet his mother\nabandoned him in the wilderness, where animals tended him. He grew to be eight feet tall, with\na hill-shaped bump on his forehead (his name, Qiu, which means hillock or mound), a square\nface, a nose like the sun, ears like a river, the forehead of a dragon, and lips shaped like the Big\nDipper constellation. He had the body of a water sprite, the spine of a tortoise, the paws of a\ntiger, and long forearms. His eyebrows had 12 colors; his eyes had 64 veins. There were\ndesigns on his palms and an inscription on his chest said, \u201cHe will create the evolutions of the\nMandate as set forth by celestial tallies that are to fix the future ages.\u201d (One can understand why\nhis mother abandoned such a weird-looking baby.)8\nConfucius as uncrowned king, mage, prophet, and god: these seem strange to us. Many\npeople now think that Confucius in fact was a diehard patriarchalism who demanded absolute,\nunthinking filial obedience to one\u2019s parents. But that Confucius, too, was invented in Han times,\nas I explain below.\nRivals to the Confucians at Court\nIn the early Han, other courtiers elbowed Confucian advisors aside. As historian Robert\nEno has written,\nWhile the Qin appears to have been a period when the major Ru [i.e., Confucian]\nmasters received state patronage and participated in state-sponsored bibliographic\nand editorial work, with the end of the Qin, the [Erudite] corps lost its standing,\nand, with it, their sanctioned possession of texts. The [Qin] book ban of 213 BCE\nremained in place after the dynasty\u2019s dissolution in 208 BC\u2026 until 191 BC, four\nyears after the end of Liu Bang\u2019s reign as the founding ruler of the Han dynasty.9\nEven after Shusun Tong helped Liu Bang tame his unruly generals, Confucians (Ru, meaning\n\u201cthe weak ones\u201d) had to compete with other experts and imperial family members for rulers\u2019\nattention.\nAll Han schools of thought shared certain ideas. All accepted yin-yang cosmology \u2013 the\nidea that complementary energies in the universe rise and fall \u2013 and a more complex theory of\nFive Phases (wuxing \u4e94\u884c) that constantly replaced one another. The Phases and their cycles\nwere associated with elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water), seasons, colors, musical tones,\nsmells, tastes, organs of the body, stars, and so on. Harmonizing oneself with the ascendant\nphase assured health for self, society, and nature. Qin, for instance, identified with the Water\nelement (black), which allowed it to extinguish the red Fire of Zhou. Correlative cosmology\nChapter 5, p. 6 91\nheld that the state, people, and the whole universe, including animals, plants, heavenly bodies,\nand spirits all resonated with each other, so that harmony in one meant harmony in the others and\ndisturbance in one disturbed the others.10 But the emperor held it all together: he was the \u201cpivot\nof the cosmos.\u201d Although courtiers debated the precise mean of particular strange phenomena,\nthey agreed that portents like eclipses predicted political trouble, and good omens \u2013 like the\nappearance of a unicorn \u2013 signaled the presence of a good ruler. This general way of thinking\ncontinued into the twentieth century; in fact, political scientist Vivienne Shue has recently argued\nthat the Chinese Communist Party has adopted and adapted certain aspects of correlative\ncosmology and other imperial modes of ruling.11\nWhile some ideas were shared, on other issues thinkers differed sharply, and competed\nfor imperial sponsorship. In the early Han, Legalists were successful, since the design of the\nQin-Han imperial state rested on their ideas. Equally powerful and popular with early Han rulers\nwere Daoists. Daoists developed Five Phases theory into methods of governance sponsored by\nEmpress Dou and others, and compiled a vision of Daoist government in the Huainan zi in 139\nBC. Emperor Wen (r. 203 \u2013 157 BC) \u2013 perhaps adhering to his Empress Dou\u2019s Daoist laissez-\nfaire principles \u2013 eliminated restrictions on the amount of land and number of slaves a household\ncould own, a dangerous revision to Legalist practice. Daoist magicians (fangshi) offered\npractical services to both the court and people: interpreting dreams, reading horoscopes and faces\nto discern fortunes, divining with the Yijing to help people decide what to do, teaching gymnastic\nexercises, bringing rain through prayer, and healing illnesses with herbs, massage, acupuncture,\ncharms, rituals, and exorcism of demons.12 The visions and services Daoists offered seemed to\nmany both more practical and more appealing than what strait-laced Confucians buried in old\ntexts and rituals had to offer.\nConfucians and other officials wanting to influence policy also had to work against, with,\nor around imperial family members. As well as empresses and their kin, imperial princesses held\ngreat influence at court \u2013 the emperor\u2019s aunts, sisters, and daughters. They passed their royal\nstatus, their titles, and their Liu family membership on to their children matrilineally. Royal\nprincesses were not punished with their husbands\u2019 families; only the emperor himself could\npunish princesses and their children. They often maintained very good relations with their\nbrothers: Wudi, for instance, lavished farmland, money, and slaves on his sisters. Furthermore,\nas women, princesses could go freely into the inner chambers of the palace, so they mediated\nbetween the inner court of the royal family and the outer court of officials. Royal princesses\noften ran their husbands\u2019 families; their status made them officially the head of the family. (In\nthe Period of Division after Han, there were even princesses who demanded a harem of\nsecondary husbands.) Royal women could be formidable rivals.\nOther intimates of the emperor also wielded considerable influence. A wetnurse, hired to\nnurse a royal baby, often stayed with the prince or princess for her whole life. They educated\ntheir charges and protected them, sometimes with their own lives, in the murderous factional\ndisputes of the Han court. Their grateful charges loaded wetnurses with wealth and honors,\nmourned like family members at their deaths, and sometimes asked their advice in ruling.13\nSecond, a bureaucracy of palace ladies organized into carefully delineated formal ranks with\nspecific duties managed the affairs of the thousands of people living in the palace. Third,\neunuchs, chosen from poor families so that they would be loyal to the emperor, served the\nimperial family, who rewarded them with political power at court, land, and salaries. In the\nChapter 5, p. 7 92\nLatter Han, eunuchs put Emperor Shun (Shundi) on the throne in 125, helped Huandi remove a\npowerful general in 159, and independently eliminated a Confucian (Dou Wu) who had tried to\nhave the leading eunuchs executed as part of his family\u2019s struggle for power.\nLegalists, magicians, Daoists, royal family members, and other kinds of favorites all\ninfluenced Han emperors and policies.\nConfucians at the Han Imperial Court\nHistorians used to believe that the Han established Confucianism as its state orthodoxy.\nBut only from the reign of Yuandi (48-33 BC) did officials frequent quote Confucius, and the\ndynasty adopt the Mandate of Heaven ideology as a legitimating model. The first imperial edict\nthat invoked Confucius was issued by the Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun, in AD 1.\nThere was no state cult to Confucius until after the fall of Han. Even the most basic practice of\nfilial piety \u2013 mourning parents for three years \u2013 was not required of officials (let alone anyone\nelse), or even encouraged during the Former Han.14\nJust as the Han vision of Confucius looks strange to us, so too does Han Confucianism.\nIt makes sense only when considered within historical processes of political competition.\nMonarchy and Meritocracy\nThroughout East Asian history, the practice of monarchy and other forms of hereditary\npower lay in tension with ideals of meritocracy \u2013 giving authority to the wise, learned, and\nvirtuous. The tension played out in numerous ways, and thinkers and politicians did not always\ntake the positions we would expect.\nConfucius had promoted ritual correctness within Zhou feudalism, and opposed changes\nin inherited status. It had been Mozi who promoted meritocracy. But as Confucians fought for a\nplace in the legalist state, they underlined that those who inherited power were responsible for\nthe people\u2019s livelihood, and they underlined meritocratic recruitment as their own way to power.\nThey defined \u201cmerit\u201d as filiality and book-learning. The Analects as we have it was put together\nin Western Han times, by roughly 50 BC, to make this argument and put it into the mouths of\nConfucius and his immediate disciples.15\nOf course, the monarchical system, in which the ruler inherited the throne regardless of\nhis personal virtue or learning, and often as a baby, ran counter to the idea of meritocracy as\nembedded in the Book of Documents account of sage-kings Yao, Shun, and Yu. Yao and Shun\nchose worthy successors: not their sons. Moreover, the focus on learning led to some discomfort\nwith the fact that the dynasty was founded through bloodshed by an illiterate rowdy. Confucians,\nin their bargain with Legalist government, helped smooth over these little problems. When\nEmperor Wen (r. 180-157 BC) was put on the throne to reclaim it for the Liu family after\nEmpress L\u00fc\u2019s death, Confucian Jia Yi wrote about his new temple:\n\u201cThe founding ancestor has [military] achievement (gong \u529f ), while the clan\nleader has de \u5fb7 .\u201d The first to capture all-under-heaven has [military]\nachievement, while the first to set all-under-Heaven in order has de. Accordingly,\nif the Temple of Contemplating Success is for the great clan leader who receives\nthe empire from the great founding ancestor, then the Han will be long-lasting,\nwithout end.16\nChapter 5, p. 8 93\nThe somewhat crude contribution of Liu Bang has grown, according to Jia Yi, into the\ncharismatic, benevolent virtue of his fifth son, chosen because his biological mother\u2019s\nfamily were weak, and given the posthumous title \u201cWen\u201d to signal his alignment with\nKing Wen of Zhou and with civilized governance.\nSome Famous Han Confucians\nDespite allying with the Legalist monarchy, famous Han Confucians gained little\ninfluence in their lifetimes. We know about them now, and overestimate their influence, because\ntheir writings survived.\nThe Qin book ban that made their possession of classics a crime was lifted in 191 BC,\nseventeen years into the Han, but Empress L\u00fc (d. 180 BC) still suspected Confucians because\nthey had supported her and Liu Bang\u2019s rival, Xiang Yu.17 Emperor Wen brought Jia Yi, famous\nfor his rhetorical attack on Qin, to court as a Classics master, yes: but he disregarded his policy\nrecommendations, preferring to heed his Daoist consort, Empress Dou.\nSima Qian\u2019s father Tan, as Grand Astronomer, was responsible for the calendar and for\nrecording court events, but Wudi treated him disrespectfully, \u201clike a jester or entertainer,\u201d as his\nson put it. Daoist fangshi took Sima\u2019s rightful place at the imperial rituals at Mt. Tai, and he\ndied of chagrin. Sima Qian himself was castrated by Wudi, and the Han court treated his history\nas subversive.\nAnother now-eminent Confucian, Liu Xiang (77 \u2013 6 BC), joined a faction trying to rein\nin the consort families of his time; he was kept out of office for 15 years, until Chengdi (r. 33-7)\ncame to the throne, began collecting scholars, and set Liu Xiang to working on the first Han\nlibrary project. As he catalogued its holdings, he also compiled stories from various sources to\ncreate the Classic of Mountains and Seas, Strategies of the Warring States, and Biographies of\nExemplary Women.\nFinally, Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BC) constantly advised Wudi to cut military spending,\nand to support small families by measures such as limiting the amount of land any one person\ncould own. He promoted re-adoption of the old Zhou god, Heaven, as a central court cult. Wudi\nignored him. Dong Zhongshu accepted a low-ranking government position, and spent his time\nteaching and writing. Nevertheless, his work had a lasting effect. For he was the key creator of\na systematic anti-woman strand in Confucian thinking.\nSystematizing Sexism\nAs in most societies in world history, mainland society had favored men over women\nwithin a given rank and generation, probably since the start of the Neolithic period. But it took\nthe marginalized Confucian intelligentsia in Han times to make sexism theoretically systematic.\nDong\u2019s anti-womanism stemmed from the competition for power at court. Wudi was only\na teenager when he ascended the throne, and his grandmother, Grand Dowager Empress Dou (d.\n135 BC) was still politically active. She blocked the appointment of scholars who openly\npromoted Confucianism, and required the emperor and all the members of her own family to\nstudy Daoism. She wished to make it the official doctrine of the government, and many copies\nof the Dao De Jing and related texts have indeed been found in burials from her reign.\nChapter 5, p. 9 94\nTo counter-attack, Dong Zhongshu reworked old concepts. One example is the yin-yang\npair. In the Book of Odes and other early sources, yin and yang referred simply to dark\nand light, shade and sun, in the natural world. The diagram represents how the seed of each\nforce grows within its complement; nature goes through transformations just as day gives way to\ndusk and night to dawn. The natural alternation (which was acted out, by the way, in the game\nof kickball), did not map to \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale.\u201d In Han theories of health, yin and yang were\ntwo complementary types of qi (energy), both present in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s bodies, which\nshould balance harmoniously within each person\u2019s body for good health, naturally waxing and\nwaning. It was Dong Zhongshu who wrote that \u201cyin and yang can be called male and female.\u201d\nTo underline that point, Dong proposed that in a drought, men should stay inside and women\nshould go out in public. The specific proposal was new, but it made sense within correlative\ncosmology.\nThe next step was to denigrate the yin, making it the worse of the two, instead of yang\u2019s\nequal complement. Dong Zhongshu identified yang (now meaning men) with the Confucian\nvirtue of humaneness or benevolence (ren \u4ec1), and yin (women) with emotion and greediness.\nHe turned the complementarity of yin and yang into a hierarchy: yang, the active force, the force\nof sunlight and maleness was and ought to be superior. Harmony of equals (\u548c) was replaced\nwith unity enforced by the superior (\u5408). Yin, which Dong labelled inferior and female, had to\nbe kept under control or the cosmos would go haywire. In one area, in 134 BC, it had rained so\nmuch that people feared there would be damage to the crops. In such situations, desperate\npeople would petition any god they knew of and follow any method that might work. Dong\nannounced:\n\u201cThe ceremony for stopping the rainfall is based on the principle of suppressing\nthe yin and promoting the yang force\u2026 [Lower-ranking officials in the area ]\nwhose wives are living in official accommodations\u2026should all send their wives\nback home. No women are allowed to go to the market, and people who live in\nthe market are not allowed to go to the well, which should be covered to prevent\nthe leaking [of the yin force]. Use meat sacrifice and beat the drum at the Earth\nshrine\u2026\u201d 18\nDong assured his readers that, with everyone praying at the Earth shrine and following\nthese instructions, the sky cleared in less than three days.\nArmed with this theory, in order to attack imperial and palace women who competed\nwith them at court, Confucians need not speak of specific persons, but could talk loftily of\ncosmic forces. They could say they feared too much yin at the capital, where the emperor was\nholding the cosmos together. Working within a shared framework that interpreted eclipses, odd\nanimals and plants, natural disasters, and even odd human behavior as portents of disaster, they\ncould add in this anti-women element. For example, the History of Han described the popular\nexcitement around the Queen Mother of the West mentioned above as a portent showing that\ndowager empresses had held too much power, throwing the cosmos out of alignment.19 Of\ncourse, not everyone agreed.\nChapter 5, p. 10 95\nThe classics were taking their final form in Han times, so new ideas were embedded in\nsupposedly old texts: for instance, the Record of Ritual (Li ji) claimed that if women disobeyed\nmen, lunar eclipses and other disasters would result.20 Mencius had spoken of five reciprocal\nhuman relationships: parent and child shared affection, ruler and minister interacted with\npropriety, husband and wife had different parts to play in the family, elder and younger brother\nobserved age order, and friends shared good faith. Dong Zhongshu spoke instead of the \u201cThree\nBonds.\u201d In the \u201cThree Bonds\u201d formulation, command by the superior and obedience by the\ninferior replaced complementarity and reciprocity. Initiated as a way for Confucians to attack\nrivals at court, the formula demanded absolute obedience and sacrifice from the child (and\ndaughter-in-law), loyalty-to-the-death from the minister (and subject), and fierce devotion of the\nwife (or widow), with no reciprocal obligations on the part of parents, rulers, or husbands.\nDong\u2019s anti-woman rhetoric was ideological \u2013 a way for Confucians to compete for\nagainst imperial women. Only later in Chinese history did it win wide acceptance. Let\u2019s see\nhow far removed from most Han people\u2019s reality systematic sexism was.\nHan Marriage and Family\nJia Yi (c. 200 \u2013 169 BC) vividly described Shang Yang\u2019s reforms in Qin as a Confucian\nnightmare: they divided brothers and undermined filial affection to such a degree that\nIf someone lent his father a rake, hoe, staff, or broom, then he put on airs of great\ngenerosity. If a mother took a gourd dipper, bowl, dustpan, or broom, her\nchildren immediately scolded her. Wives suckled infants when their fathers-in-\nlaw were present, and if wife and mother-in-law did not get along, they snarled\nand glared at one another. 21\nPeople loved their young children, while despising their parents. But Qin was gone. Jia Yi\u2019s\npurpose was to lament that the Han regime continued to value the nuclear family, maintaining\nLegalist policy.\nMost people, in Han times and thereafter, lived in families of roughly five people.22 Han\nfrom 186 BC permitted adult sons to live together, but it encouraged family division into\nhusband-wife pairs. Han policies forced women to marry by increasing their labor taxes fivefold\nbetween the ages of 15 and 30 if they did not. The family centered on the conjugal pair\n(sometimes called \u201cone husband, one wife,\u201d sometimes \u201ca farmer and a weaver\u201d), because the\nhard work of both partners was needed to feed, clothe, and house a family and pay taxes. The\nhusband-wife bond was understood as so important to the household economy that Han law\nallowed either husband or wife to initiate divorce. Han women frequently did divorce husbands\nwho were poor or sick or had mean parents. After divorce or if one spouse died, remarriage was\nthe usual practice, to assure that everyone had a working partner.\nWork roles were gendered to some extent. Each commoner household produced grain\nand cloth. On family farms, everyone pitched in for planting or harvest. Moreover, each 23-\nyear-old man spent a year in military training and one in service, retrained each autumn, and\ncould be called up for the next 30 years of his life. Men\u2019s labor service could be far from home\n(women did their labor service in the local area), so wives had to do farming tasks when\nhusbands were away. They also accompanied their husbands when posted away from home on\nChapter 5, p. 11 96\nmilitary duty, doing both farm and textile work. So, women did farm. But weaving involved\nspecialized knowledge, and apparently Han men absolutely did not work with textiles; thus, it\nwas they who were excluded from a high-status, remunerative field of labor. Women who could\nafford to proudly stuck to textile and household work, passing \u201cmen\u2019s work\u201d off to servants and\njunior family members of both sexes. Both men and women worked as servants, as artisans (in\nimperial workshops, women made most lacquer objects), as merchants large and small, and as\nhealers, both doctors and shamans. Work roles were not completely divided by gender.\nFamily identity recognized the complementary roles of husband and wife. Normally, a\nwife moved to her husband\u2019s home and land, but there were uxorilocal marriages (uxor means\n\u201cwife\u201d). A person took his or her surname (family name) from the father, but surnames were not\npermanent, and people might change to the mother\u2019s surname until about AD 200. Wives kept\ntheir own surnames (so we speak of Empress L\u00fc, the wife of Liu Bang, and of Ban Zhao, who\nmarried into the Cao family.) When a wife died, inscribed over her coffin were her natal (birth-\nfamily) surname and her order of birth among her sisters, not her place in her husband\u2019s family.\nConnections were social resources, and part of the function of marriage, perhaps especially\namong wealthier commoners, was precisely to ally families. We might call this an ambilineal\nsystem: social being was determined by both the father\u2019s and mother\u2019s kin.\nIn Han practice and law, husband and wife also shared rights to property, in different\nforms. The wife often managed the household budget, which remained true throughout the\nimperial period. Even if the husband managed the budget during his lifetime, law and social\nnorms allowed the wife \u2013 not the son \u2013 to do so when he was incompetent or dead. Women\nowned land and could contest a man\u2019s claim to land ownership in a lawsuit in court. Both men\nand women paid poll tax, which assumes that each had an income. When a family married a\ndaughter out, she took with her a dowry, both as kind of retirement insurance for her parents (she\nwould assist them as they aged) and to show her status as a beloved child and representative of\nher natal family. The wife\u2019s dowry remained her property, both in law and in custom \u2013 this too\nwas true throughout most of the imperial period. If she died the dowry went to her children, not\nto her husband\u2019s other children. A widow could inherit her deceased husband\u2019s property in her\nown name, as did one fabulously wealthy female owner of cinnabar mines. If a son died before\nhis mother, she could also dispose of his property, even granting it to her children by other\nhusbands. An excavated tomb-contract from AD 5 records: Zhu Ling\u2019s mother had married\nthree times and had six children, and when her final husband died, she changed her will several\ntimes, in the end settling his estate and hers on all of her children \u2013 one of them a criminal.23\nFrom the fiscal point of view, laws that gave both husbands and wives rights and\nresponsibilities were aimed at preserving a tax-base of small, productive, easy-to-control\nhouseholds. From the economic point of view, each household needed to grow grain and\nvegetables and raise chickens and pigs, and to raise hemp or ramie or silkworms to make cloth,\nnot to speak of cooking, cleaning, and caring for the young and the old. A strong husband-wife\npartnership was the key to a healthy family economy and state fisc.\nThis partnership had cultural implications. First, loyalty and property rested with the\nnuclear family. When one man funded his son and his nephew equally, the son\u2019s wife\ncomplained that this was not the norm: \u201cEach one has his own family! How can we continue on\nlike this?\u201d\nChapter 5, p. 12 97\nSecond, matrilineal kin were just as close \u2013 or just as distant \u2013 as patrilineal kin. For\ninstance, Dowager Empress Wang (70 BC \u2013 AD 13) had two full brothers, and six half-brothers\nby the same father. She made her two brothers marquises and gave them the income produced\nby about 8,000 households; she gave her half-brothers lower titles and less than half the income,\nshowing that she \u2013 like most Han people \u2013 valued her mother\u2019s line. She had another half-\nbrother by her mother, by a different father, and she wangled him lucrative government posts;\nagain thinking about her mother\u2019s descent line. The Han History reports that her various\nrelatives \u201ctook advantage of their opportunities and were extravagant, competing with one\nanother in their equipages and horses, music and women, idleness and gadding about.\u201d Another\nhalf-brother had unfortunately died before the Empress\u2019s handouts. His son, Wang Mang, was\ntotally ignored by his luckier wealthy cousins. They offered no help: they did not see the\npatrilineal clan connection as meaning that they should support him.24 Ultimately, it was his\nconnection with his maternal aunt that gave him a stepping-stone to power \u2013 we will see below\nwith what result.\nBut first: How did the norm of smallholding nuclear families weaken over time? What\ndoes that have to do with Confucianism?\nThe Rise of the Clans\nThe Wealth Gap\nWarned by Han Feizi\u2019s Legalism, the Han government had understood from the\nbeginning the danger of private wealth, as court debates reflect. In 64 BC, for instance, officials\nwho wanted more grain in government storehouses proposed that some criminals be permitted to\ncommute physical punishment to a fine in grain. But other officials objected: The rich would be\nable to pay and the poor would not, so punishment for the same crime would be unequal,\nviolating a fundamental Legalist principle. And if poor people ate less, scrimping to rescue a\nrelative from a beating, in effect more people would be punished, which would damage the\nrelationship of mutual support between the emperor and the people.25 Throughout Former Han\nthe court constantly reconfigured policies on taxation, mercantile activity, state production and\nso on, trying to find the right balance.\nFinding the right balance was hard, probably impossible, and in the end, the free market\nin land, along with taxation, destroyed the smallholding class. How did that happen? Farmers\neverywhere live on an annual cycle that makes them vulnerable: the harvest comes in fall, and is\neaten up over the winter. In spring, farmers need grain for planting, and if a family had to eat it\nall in a long winter, they had to borrow seed grain at high rates of interest. Once deep in debt, or\nif a crucial worker had suffered an injury or died, a family might have to sell its land to a\nwealthier neighbor. Family members \u2013 their land gone \u2013 became share-cropping tenants,\nservants, house-slaves, or outlaws. The ability to sell and buy land meant opportunity and\nsuccess for some families in each village, and disaster for many. A small initial advantage could\ntranslate into a big difference in wealth and power in the local area over time.\nOn the one hand, the poor lost their independent farms and fell into servitude. And, on\nthe other hand, the wealthy families began to develop a new form of organization. The law\nrequired families to divide property, so they mostly did not live together in extended families.\nBut families with shared ancestry banded together to support one another and hold onto family\nproperty. Cooperating enabled them to increase their wealth yet further.\nChapter 5, p. 13 98\nBig estates worked by tenants produced not only pigs, chickens, and sheep; millet, wheat\nand barley; but also pickles, vinegar, and sauces, and ale. A really large estate might have its\nown mill to grind wheat, and family members, tenants, and slaves making silk and hemp cloth,\ncandles, and other items for use or for sale. By engaging in commerce, such wealthy farmers\nbecame richer, eventually perhaps entering the trade in luxury goods. And the state struggled to\ntax commercial wealth: land cannot be hidden, but bales of silk and barrels of pickles can.\nThen local wealth translated into local power. The rich clans made loans to more\nneighbors in trouble and took their land when they couldn\u2019t pay them back. Demanding other\nkinds of service from neighbors they undermined equality, turning them into servile dependents.\nSome even hired thugs, and as wealthy families with shared ancestors banded together into clans,\nsome could muster a thousand kinsmen and retainers for a fight, even two or three thousand.\nHow could small families maintain their independence?\nNext, power over neighbors translated into influence over local government. In order to\nkeep taxes low, the Han kept official staffs small. That meant that county magistrates had to\nwork with local people to collect taxes, maintain roads and granaries, raise troops, etc. Naturally,\nthey worked with those who had the wealth and influence locally to get things done, and\nnaturally those people asked for favors in return \u2013 including illegal tax breaks. If a county\u2019s\nwealthy families evaded taxes, the magistrate had no choice but to impose the tax burden on their\npoorer, weaker neighbors. The wealth gap widened.\nFinally, local political power translated into national political power. The normal route\ninto office in Han times was a meritocratic one. Magistrates had to recommend a certain number\nof men each year to be considered for official positions. A magistrate would of course\nrecommend the sons of the wealthy men he had been working with. Not only did they earn\nsalaries, but the wealthy farming class as a whole gained power over central government policy.\nAny reformer hoping to mitigate the wealth and influence of the big clans now faced members of\nthe big clans at court. The clans also married daughters into the imperial family, so they came to\ninclude wives and mothers, fathers-in-law and grandfathers of emperors.\nExcept for those members who were in office, the clans were still legally commoners, not\na ranked, hereditary aristocracy. Compared with feudal domains, or the estates of lesser Zhou\nnobility, or the estates of the great European nobility later, the Han clans\u2019 holdings were small.\nNo one clan could not raise an army to threaten the throne. But a group of intermarrying clans,\ntied to one another by favors and aid given back and forth over decades and generations, could\ndominate a local area. They could assure that it was their sons who won office; their daughters\nwho married well up.\nAfter centuries of aristocratic dominance under Shang and Zhou, the Qin and early Han\nhad allowed ordinary people to benefit from their talents and advance through meritocratic\nrecruitment into the state. As the Han big clans rose to power, that brief window of opportunity\nclosed for a thousand years.\nThe new social elite were able to reproduce their power over generations because,\nworking together in Han times as a class (based on ownership of the means of production), and\nholding office in the imperial state, they could block policies that threatened them. So it proved\nwith the unlucky nephew whose father had missed the handouts of the Empress Dowager Wang.\nChapter 5, p. 14 99\nWang Mang\u2019s \u201cNew\u201d Dynasty, AD 9-23\nIn AD 9, the nephew of Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun, Wang Mang, took the throne,\ndeclaring a \u201cNew\u201d (Xin) regime. He combined renewed Legalist governance with Confucian\nritual.\nFirst, ritual: In Qin and early Han times, the imperial family worshipped changing sets of\nancestors. Over 300 shrines to Liu Bang alone received offerings across the empire. In 40 BC,\nthe court dramatically reduced these expensive ancestral cults, at the recommendation of\nConfucians. But it rejected their suggestion of setting up a cult to Heaven. Besides imperial\nancestors, the main state cult in Qin and early Han worshipped the four and then five di (same\nold di \u5e1d!) who governed the directions of the compass (the fifth is the center), each represented\nby an animal and a color. Wudi started new cults to \u201cthe Grand Unity\u201d and Empress Earth, and\nonly under Wang Mang did the cult of Heaven replace them. This makes sense. Just as the\nZhou founders relied on Heaven to transcend powerful Shang ancestors, so Wang Mang claimed\nthe Mandate of Heaven; since he was not a Liu he could not rely on his ancestors to justify his\nclaim to the Han throne, and fell back on this Confucian-sponsored deity.\nSecond: fiscal reform. After Wudi\u2019s long reign, though policies changed, the rich\nsteadily got richer and more commoners fell into tenancy and even slavery. Wang wanted to\nrestore the tax base of the central government, but he failed. On the one hand, he issued some\nmeasures for environmental conservation, and he tried to redistribute land and outlaw slavery,\nfor a reboot of the smallholder economy. That won him the determined enmity of the wealthy\nclans, who by that time also held many bureaucratic positions. On the other hand, he lost\npopular support by enslaving thousands of people, including innocent families and members of\nmutual responsibility groups, as punishment for the desperate measures some had taken when a\nterrible frost destroyed crops in AD 21. Han had used the mutual responsibility groups only\nadministratively, not arresting people for the crimes of other families; Wang Mang revived this\nquintessentially Legalist system.\nWang Mang was talented and hardworking, so his regime might have lasted, nevertheless,\nhad it not been for an unavoidable environmental catastrophe. The Yellow River carries an\nenormous amount of silt from the Gobi Desert and the mountains: hence its name. Its bed\nconstantly rises, and high dikes keep it in the channel. But they require constant maintenance.\nWhat with the expenses of the Xiongnu wars, even Wudi had not really maintained the dikes,\nand after him the government had still less money, as the big clans stopped paying taxes. In AD\n3, the river flooded so dramatically that it shifted to debouch into the sea south of the Shandong\npeninsula, rather than north. This geological shift occurs about once every six hundred years.\nWang Mang\u2019s regime was hit with flooding, refugees, disease, and famine. Rebels, including\none called \u201cMother L\u00fc\u201d and a group called the Red Eyebrows, caused further suffering. Then\nthe rain stopped and drought set in. Like the Second Qin Emperor, Wang refused to take advice,\nand acted increasingly bizarre. Wang died in AD 23, Han loyalist troops and the Red Eyebrows\nbattled it out in the capital.\nThe winner was \u2013 or claimed to be \u2013 a distant relative of the Liu imperial line.26 He kept\nthe name Han for his dynasty, and the basic structure of government. But the power of the clans\nwas paramount, and the cultural style was different. Ban Gu, writing around AD 100, as\nChapter 5, p. 15 100\nhistorian Mark Edward Lewis explains, \u201clinked the Western Han with the Qin in an age of\nviolence and barbarism, while celebrating the triumph of culture and ritual in the Eastern Han.\u201d27\nIn the re-established Eastern Han, Emperor Guangwu released all those whom Wang\nMang had enslaved \u2013 but not those enslaved by the former Han. Eleven million people had died\nor dropped off the population registers, and wealth reform was dead, too. In Latter Han times,\nthe clans dominated both local society and the central state. Their new kind of power \u2013 not\nhereditary rank power, but class power, based on the control of land and labor \u2013 required a new\nideology and new forms of organization.\nThe clans needed ideology and organization to hold their clan property, the basis of their\npower, together. They needed a system of beliefs to counteract the legal and common values\nassociated with the conjugal pair and nuclear family, and to justify their power to the state, their\nneighbors, and themselves. They created a new family organization and ideology, often labelled\n\u201cConfucian.\u201d\nHan Clan Ideology and Organization\nIn order to hold their property together, and assure that clan members cooperated with\none another both locally and at court to promote shared interests, clan leaders had to counter the\nnorm, embedded in the law, that the nuclear family and husband-wife bond were most important.\nTo create a clear line of command within the large number of families making up the clan, they\nhad to fight the norm of equality embedded in the law. They could not just say, \u201cWe reject all\nthe changes since Qin,\u201d because, as commoners, they relied on the Qin and Han institutions of\nprivate property and meritocracy. So they adopted and revised old feudal ideas and attributed\nthem to Confucius, drawing on and reshaping the ritual classics. They adopted from the Zhou\naristocracy the neat tracing of a patrilineal descent line from father to sons, distinguishing elder\nfrom younger sons. They associated with this patrilineal ideal a number of other demands on\nfamily members \u2013 \u201cideological,\u201d because they justified some people bossing around other people.\nFirst, the big clans made ancestors important again. Most people in Han times just did\nnot think much about their ancestors at all. Biographies in the History of Former Han (written\nby Ban Gu (AD 32-92) and his sister, Ban Zhao) recount a man\u2019s own titles and\naccomplishments, but rarely give even the names of his forefathers. Historian Hou Xudong\nwrites,\nIn the Western Han period, Chinese as a whole lacked deep concern about the\nnames of their ancestors. Few people could remember the names of their\ngrandfathers, to say nothing of ancestors deeper in the past.28\nAround the end of Former Han, the rising clans started to think more about ancestors; Wang\nMang promoted this trend, and the first excavated epitaph that records five generations of\npatrilineal ancestors was carved in 165 AD. (By the way, this epitaph also claimed that the\ndeceased was distantly descended from the Kija.)29 Inscriptions on stone (steles) recorded who\nwas buried in a tomb, and glorified ancestors; they also had holes cut through them to hang\nofferings from. One historian, explaining this practice, calls them \u201coutdoor bronze vessels.\u201d30\nSurnames, originally given to commoners to register them as taxpayers, now tracked patrilineal\nancestors, their achievements, and perhaps their spiritual power to help descendants. \u201cWhat are\nChapter 5, p. 16 101\nsurnames for?\u201d asked Ban Gu. \u201cThey are the way that we honor contributions and\nvirtue/efficacious spiritual power (gongde\u529f\u5fb7) and discourage mere cunning and force.\u201d\nSecond, not all ancestors were equal. Surnames passed patrilineally, and matrilineal kin\nbegan to be denigrated. Sociologist Pan Guangdan argues that the ritual system of mourning\ngrades in the ritual classic Book of Etiquette and Propriety (Yili \u5100\u79ae, completed in Han times\nand a key test of patrilinealism) did not record actual ancient practice. Rather, it argued against\nnormal practice, recommending that fathers and paternal kin should be mourned more deeply\nthan mothers and maternal kin.31 Even among patrilineal kin, the clan ideologists created\nhierarchy modelled on the Zhou feudal lines. One senior or \u201ctrunk\u201d line carried on the worship of\nthe ancestors, and outranked \u201cbranch\u201d or junior lines stemming from younger brothers.\nThird, the patrilinealists set new priorities and a chain of command. They argued that the\nclan was more important than the individual or the nuclear family. Older clan members of the\nfamily, members of senior generations, and members of senior lines were more valuable \u2013 they\nargued \u2013 than younger and junior people. They created a clear chain of family rank and\ncommand. No two people within the family were equal. Gender, age, generation, birth order,\nand line membership all figured into a person\u2019s family rank. Men dominated women within the\nsame level of hierarchy and same generation, but mothers commanded sons and other juniors. In\nthis patriarchal system, filial piety meant the sacrifice of juniors to seniors in all dimensions.\nStories told of virtuous aunts who sacrificed their own sons to save their nephews in the senior\nline. Wives should sacrifice their own interests to obey their parents-in-law, younger brothers\nobey elder brothers and protect their children first, and so on. The ranking facilitated clear lines\nof command as the clan grew.\nFourth, to keep the clan property intact for maximum power, the clan ideologists argued\nthat divorce was ethically wrong. For women to remarry after being widowed was also wrong.\nRecall that in a divorce or when a widow remarried, by law she took her dowry, her husband\u2019s\nproperty, and her children with her. In order to keep top-down \u201charmony\u201d within the family by\npreventing friendly or amorous relations now that clan members were spending more time\ntogether, the clan ideologists promoted the separation and differentiation of the sexes, and\nritualized relations between them. For similar reasons, they promoted monogamy, meaning that\neach man had only one primary wife. If he insisted on marrying a concubine (secondary wife),\nthe wife outranked the concubine, and had control of how she spent her time. A concubine could\nnever be promoted to primary wife, even if the primary wife died. A concubine had no\nimportance outside of her relationship with her husband; even her children belonged to the\nprimary wife, and the concubine might even be buried with her husband when he died, against\nher will. Again, the differentiation of types of wife assured that was it clear who outranked\nwhom.\nFinally, patrilinealists declared procreation a key duty of sons, who had to carry on the\nline. These ideas the clans linked with Confucius, inventing the new Classic of Filial Piety to\nput words into his mouth, and associating the Zuo Commentary with its attention to surnames\nwith the Spring and Autumn Annals. (Han people also used copies of the Classic of Filial Piety\nto ward off demons.)32\nChapter 5, p. 17 102\nConfucian Ideology\nPatrilineal ideology empowered senior wives, as well as senior husbands. A very well-\nknown argument for this style of Confucianism was written by Ban Zhao, who finished the\nHistory of Former Han for her brother. Her instructions are often called Lessons for Women and\nin the early twentieth century came to be understood as betrayal, teaching women to simply obey\nmen. But \u5973\u8aa1 could also be translated \u201cA Warning for Wives,\u201d and interpreted as advice about\nhow to avoid being legally divorced; or as \u201cA Warning about Women,\u201d arguing that they ought\nto be educated; or as \u201cLessons for Wives,\u201d promising a set of good outcomes to the wife who\nfollows the Confucian path of family duty, ritual, and learning. It could be translated \u201cAdvice\nfor Daughters,\u201d in which Ban addressed teenagers, using their wish for love and worries about\ntheir looks to convince them to follow the Confucian path. If translated \u201cA Warning from a\nWoman,\u201d it could constitute a way for political women and men to stay safe at the dangerous\nHan court. Finally, given that Ban Zhao educated royal women and advised Empress Deng, who\npromoted Daoism, the title \u201cFeminine Advice\u201d could lead us to look for Daoist elements.\nPatrilineal ideology and organization reinforced the clans\u2019 power as landholders. Filial\npiety stories aimed at indoctrinating juniors. Tomb carvings portrayed filial exemplars alongside\nor the usual pictures of Daoist transcendents, the Queen Mother of the West, deities, and martial\nheroes. For the first time, filial piety came to mean absolute obedience to parents and seniors,\nand abnegation of the self. (But it could clash with other values in the new code. Confucian\nscholar Xun Shuang (AD 128-90), urged his widowed daughter Cai to remarry and live a full life.\nBut Cai thought remarriage was wrong, and committed suicide rather than obeying her father.)\nFilial piety stories also advertised the clan. The Han government, you will recall,\nrecruited candidates for office through recommendation by county officials on the basis of virtue\nand learning. The filial sons of clans with the resources to allow them to study The Analects and\nThe Classic of Filial Piety, and then the Five Classics, would naturally be recommended for\noffice. The Classic of Filial Piety overtly connected family virtue with utility to the state:\nAs one serves one\u2019s family, so one serves one\u2019s mother, drawing on the same love.\nAs one serves one\u2019s father, so one serves one\u2019s prince, drawing on the same\nreverence\u2026 If one serves the prince with the filiality one shows one\u2019s father, if\nbecomes the virtue of loyalty. If one serves one\u2019s superiors in office with\nbrotherly submission, it becomes the virtue of obedience. Never failing loyalty\nand obedience, this is how one serves one\u2019s superiors. Thus may one preserve\nrank and office and continue the family sacrifices. This is the filiality of the\nscholar official\u2026 33\nSo much for the idea that the truly loyal official was like Mencius: one who told the ruler\nunpleasant truths when necessary. The new Confucianism, ever more prominent in Latter Han as\nmembers of the clans served as officials and married emperors, promised rulers obedience.\nClans vs. Han\nBut the promise was broken. For the emperors of Latter Han, after Guangwu, were\nweaklings who took the throne as babies or children and died before they were 40. They married\nmembers of the clans, and their mothers and fathers-in-law, along with court eunuchs, bossed\nthem around instead of obeying them. The consort kin collected as much as wealth they could,\nChapter 5, p. 18 103\nand tried to secure their positions by slaughtering their rivals. The court had collected less and\nless public income, and with public conscription over, military power passed to the heads of\ncommanderies \u2013 also of course from the clans \u2013 who created private armies. Some villages\nmoved up into the hills to escape the disorder, a practice poeticized by Tao Yuanming (365?-427)\nin \u201cThe Peach-Blossom Spring,\u201d but others fell under the control of the clans.\nThe growing power of great clans rested on a number of things, as the example of the Cui\nclan of Boling illustrates. First, they owned land and were respected leaders in the local\ncommunity at Boling in Hebei. They attended to relations and social prestige there, visiting\nneighbors, maintaining good relations with other, less-wealthy respected people, providing\ncharity to needy neighbors, and serving as local intermediaries with officials. Second, they were\nasked to hold office and often accepted for brief periods. But in the Han period, few of the Cuis\nheld office for very long; Cui Yin argued that attending to family ritual was a legitimate\noccupation in itself. In the Period of Division, Daoism further legitimated the choice not to serve.\nThird, clans taught their children the classics and literature. Some families specialized in\nparticular texts that they owned, with family traditions of interpretation. They wrote elegant\nessays and poems. Fourth, they knew how to act properly at funerals and towards their elders.\nFifth, clan members stuck together in large numbers and over generations, through attention to\npatrilineal principles and family ritual, and through economic savvy. They managed farmland,\ntenants, and slaves, and invested in enterprises such as brewing. They accrued enough wealth to\nprofit by buying low and selling high. And sixth, when necessary they fortified and armed their\nestates.34 Clans like this displayed their Confucian virtue through tomb art in a dramatically\ndifferent style from that of royalty, eunuchs, and wealthy mercantile families.35\nThe clans\u2019 local power increased after the Han dynasty fell. They came to consider\nthemselves truly, and naturally, better than others. They formed a new hereditary elite.\nFig. 5.2 Bronze and iron plaque in the form of a demon. Latter Han.

Public Domain.\nChapter 5, p. 19 104\nDaoism and the Fall of Han\nThis Han Confucianism reached only a small elite. Its very purpose was to distinguish\nthe clans from others. Daoism, by contrast, both incorporated aspects of popular religion and\nserved ordinary people, especially as Han governance fell apart.\nPopular religion included three types of spirits: cared-for ancestors; neglected dead\npeople who became hungry ghosts or demons; and nature gods like those of Shinto, imagined as\nsomewhat like people or animals. Confucian texts like the Record of Rites presented spirits as\nformless. But most people thought of deities like Heaven and Earth anthropomorphically, while\nrain spirits looked like dragons, local spirits of trees or streams often looked like snakes, and\nbirds, foxes, bears, and other animals could be good spirits or demons who could make trouble.\nPeople in Eastern Han times feared that their dead ancestors, too, could bring disease or other\ntroubles, and took ritual steps to keep them in their graves and the underworld. People even\npulverized their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 bones and boiled them in poison to keep them away\nfrom the living.\nPeople had long pacified spirits and demons with blood sacrifice, contacted them in shamanistic\ntrances, and assured fertility of field and womb with orgiastic rituals. Daoists rejected blood\nsacrifice, replaced trance and orgy with written charms and petitions, exorcised demons and\nbrought them into a pantheon, a hierarchy of all gods. They also added new types of spirits:\ntranscendents with their purified qi and special powers and Lord Lao (the deified Laozi,\nsupposed author of the Dao De Jing), who embodied the Dao. Don\u2019t forget the Queen Mother of\nthe West! Daoists won adherents by promising transformations of the increasingly chaotic real\nworld, and building communities that protected people. 36\nThe Great Peace (Taiping) movement, beginning in roughly AD 145, taught that the\ncosmos encompassed heaven; humans of nine sorts from transcendents down to slaves; and earth\n(the realm of nature spirits and the dead). All were made of cosmic qi, which needed to flow\nsmoothly to prevent natural disaster and political corruption. Followers abstained from alcohol\nand meat, meditated, made vegetarian offerings to ancestors and spirits, and purified themselves\nin expectation of a new age. Beginning in the next jiazi year (using the old Shang counting\nsystem, AD 184 by our count), they believed, the whole world would experience the proper flow\nof cosmic qi so that everyone would be healthy, long-lived, good, and happy. A leader named\nZhang Jue and his brothers in 175 organized disciplined units to spread the word, and in 184\nabout 360,000 followers wearing yellow headscarves rebelled against the \u201cblue heaven\u201d of Han\nto bring in the \u201cyellow heaven\u201d of a new, better age. The \u201cYellow Turbans\u201d were defeated, but\nthe militarization required to defeat them led to the fall of the Han dynasty.37\nA second Daoist community survived the fall of Han. A fangshi magician named Zhang\nDaoling, searching the mountains of Sichuan for a special ingredient, had a trance-vision in\nwhich Lord Lao appointed him \u201cCelestial Master,\u201d gave him healing powers, and told him that\nthe world would soon end. He should gather followers and teach them to purify themselves to\nserve as \u201cseed-people\u201d for a new epoch. Celestial Master Zhang and his successors taught that\nLord Lao ruled the whole cosmos through a heavenly bureaucracy of spirit generals who could\nconquer the demons that caused sickness, misfortune, and death. The Celestial Masters\norganized whole households of their followers into districts, headed by officials (both men and\nwomen) recruited and promoted on the basis of merit. In return for paying a tax of five pecks of\nChapter 5, p. 20 105\nrice or the equivalent in silk, pottery, or other goods, adherents won protection from demons by a\nwhole list of spirit generals called a \u201cregister\u201d and carried in a sash around the waist. Individuals\nwho had committed sins, however, were still vulnerable to demon attack. A sick person would\nbe isolated to identify those sins in their own minds; then a senior master would write them down\nin triplicate and burn them, petitioning the heavenly bureaucracy to erase them from the record.\nFor the first time in East Asian history, joining a sect required moral behavior instead of just\npropitiating spirits, and for the first time, unethical behavior brought on demonic illness.38\nA strong sense of community came from practices probably influenced by Buddhism\n(regular recitations of the Dao De Jing and ethical commandments, and detailed rules about daily\nlife) and festival banquets for all, with wine and meat served as a break from normal practice.\nInitiation into higher levels of the hierarchy (meaning one could call upon greater and greater\nregisters of demon-quelling spirit generals) involved ritualized sexual intercourse, a violation of\nordinary norms that may have bound members more tightly together against the outside world.\nCommunity members also cooperated in offering services to that wider world: maintaining roads\nand bridges, for instance. The Celestial Masters submitted to post-Han warlord Cao Cao, who\ndissolved their tight organization. But the sect still exists today, and many of their ideas and\nvalues were also absorbed into the underlying popular religion.39\nLegalist government practice was so widespread after four centuries that it had reshaped\npopular religion. Confucianism was by no means the only ideology or religion in Han times.\nHan Confucianism comprised disparate strands. It created dignity for emperors and enabled\nofficials to argue against war and state monopolies. Officials deployed it to oppose female\ndynastic power. The clans developed it as an ideology to shore up their organization and keep\nproperty together. As they became a new aristocracy, they relied on Confucianism as a family\npractice that set them apart from the commoner class they had sprung from.\nConfucianism\u2019s victory was not inevitable. Anthropologist Eugene Anderson points out\nthat at the court of the king of Huainan, Liu An (d. 122) scholars focused on practical Daoist\neconomic thought. Elsewhere a scholar recorded controlled experiments in research on\nagriculture that were sponsored by the government, and gave practical advice on farming. If Liu\nAn, or someone else with his interests, had ruled the Han empire instead of Wudi, Anderson asks,\nwould serious agricultural science have developed?40 A mixture of Daoism with practical\neconomics and science would have led to a very different kind of civilization, and the impact of\nBuddhism \u2013 which the next chapter will discuss \u2013 would have taken different directions, too.\nNote: In China today, the whole past up into the nineteenth century is called \u201cancient.\u201d\nIn American and European usage, the \u201cancient\u201d period ended with the fall of Han, and the\n\u201cmedieval\u201d or \u201cmiddle period\u201d of Chinese history began.\n1 Poo, In Search of Personal Welfare.\n2\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Queen_Mother_of_the_West,_unearthed_from_Cheng\ndu,_Sichuan,_Eastern_Han_dynasty,_25-220_AD,_tomb_tile_-_Sichuan_University_Museum_-\n_Chengdu,_China_-_DSC06292.jpg\nChapter 5, p. 21 106\n3 Lullo, \u201cFemale Divinities in Han Dynasty Representation,\u201d p. 260.\n4 Tseng, Picturing Heaven, 265.\n5 Translated in Tseng, Picturing Heaven, 214, with some modifications.\n6 This quotation comes from and this section is based on Cahill, Transcendence and Divine Passion,\nchapter 1.\n7 Robert Eno, \u201cEarly Chinese Thought Course Readings,\u201d chinatxt.sitehost.iu.edu/Thought/Chunqiu.pdf,\naccessed August 7, 2020.\n8 This section is drawn from Michael Nylan and Thomas Wilson, Lives of Confucius: Civilization\u2019s\nGreatest Sage through the Ages.\n9 Eno, \u201cThe Lunyu as an Accretion Text,\u201d 61.\n10 Archaeologists recently recovered over 4,500 wooden and bamboo strips with writing from the Former\nHan in a tomb in Jingzhou, Hubei, including calendrical charts, annals, laws, day-books, medical\ntreatises, and so on.

Yet many\nfactors complicate this trope. Shang controlled only a small area. Zhou was larger, but its feoffs\nbecame independent states. The first empire expanded west of the Ordos and south of the\nYangzi, but focused on river valleys suitable for farming. From the end of Han until the fall of\nQing in 1911, what had been Han territory was politically united for only about 525 years; it was\ndivided about two-thirds of the time. Political unity may have been the ideal \u2013 or an ideal \u2013 but it\nwas not the norm. Between the fall of Han and the rise of Sui, the mainland saw many dynasties\nand would-be dynasties \u2013 those that failed before the second generation \u2013 come and go. Many\nruled only a small area. The convention of naming periods after dynasties that governed \u201cChina\u201d\nduring a set of years, therefore, does not work well.1\nHistorian Chen Sanping writes that although the written record takes for granted the\nexistence of a core \u201cChina\u201d even after Han control splintered, such a core lies in nothing\nconcrete.2 North and South diverged, while communities in the peninsula and archipelago\nselectively adopted riziculture, metallurgy, governing techniques and ideology, and Chinese\nwritten language and literate culture: the whole Sinitic tradition. As Japan, Korea, and Vietnam\nadopted that tradition, they contributed to it as well. It cannot be considered purely Chinese.\nAs mainland regimes split, regimes on the archipelago and peninsula + Manchuria\nconsolidated. Individuals, clans, communities, and polities across East Asia interacted with one\nanother: angling for precious, exotic prestige goods and useful iron, jostling for advantage in\ntrade and war, immigrating to escape trouble, intermarrying, and sharing skills. Twentieth-\ncentury scholars, to whom nations looked natural, saw interactions in terms of national\ndomination. But as historian Wang Zhenping writes, \u201cAdmiration, importation, and\nconsumption of Chinese values and institutions, however, did not necessarily translate into\npolitical subservience\u2026 Cultural and political borrowing were merely a means to facilitate\nsystem building at home.\u201d3 More substantial than ethnicity or nation were inherited rank and\nviolent elite domination of workers.\nKogury\u014f\u2019s East Asia\nCao-Wei and Kogury\u014f\nOn the mainland, the military commanders who defeated the Yellow Turbans did not\ndisperse their armies, but rather became warlords. In 191, one looted and burned the imperial\ncapital at Luoyang, including its imperial and private libraries. Five years later, thirteen warlords\nhad carved up the Han empire. One of them, Cao Cao, acting for the Han heir, won control of\nthe north \u2013 about half of the Han empire\u2019s people. Cao Cao\u2019s son deposed the Han monarch and\ndeclared his own dynasty, the Cao-Wei (220-265). Two other regimes formed: the Shu-Han\n(221-263) in Sichuan, and the Wu (222-280) centered on Nanjing on the Yangzi River.4 These\nare the (Chinese) Three Kingdoms.\n\"An Outline History of East Asia to 1200, third edition\" by Sarah Schneewind is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.

Now, as\nthe Han empire broke up, so too the Xiongnu confederation shattered into clans and tribes.\nQiang Tibetans moved into Han territory, and settlers in the West abandoned by the Han regime\nallied with them. A new nomadic power, the Xianbei, arose in northeastern Manchuria. Changes\nin the steppe sent mounted warriors out from bases in Central Asia and the northern steppe into\nthe Yellow River area and down towards the Yangzi. The horsemen clashed and cooperated\nwith the sedentary agricultural aristocracy developing out of the Han clans. Their shared empire\nwe can refer to as the Sino-Steppe empire, with changes in ruling house mattering less than\noverall trends.\nRather than any Sino-Steppe dynasty, the longest lasting state in the period was the first\nand largest of the (Korean) Three Kingdoms, Kogury\u014f (c. 37 BC - AD 668).\nKogury\u014f chiefs in Manchuria had clashed with the Han empire and subjugated the people\nalong the eastern coast of the peninsula. In AD 200, Kogury\u014f built a capital in the upper Yalu\nRiver valley (now Jilin province in China), and by expanding along the Yalu, threatened the\nSino-Steppe dynasty called Cao-Wei in two ways. First, Cao-Wei had occupied the Lelang and\nChapter 6, p. 2 109\nDaifang commanderies in 236-38 to benefit from trade with the southern peninsula, but Kogury\u014f\nnow controlled trade routes. Second, Kogury\u014f established diplomatic relations with Cao-Wei\u2019s\nsouthern-mainland rivals, Wu and Shu. As we will see below, Cao-Wei welcomed an alliance\nwith Queen Himiko of Wa in the archipelago, and in 245, its soldiers destroyed the Kogury\u014f\ncapital. The fifty years it took for the regime to recover gave its rival confederacies in the\npeninsula, the Samhan, a breathing space.\nThe Mainland Jin Dynasties and the Samhan of the Peninsula\nTwenty years after the Cao-Wei victory over Kogury\u014f, in 265, a general usurped the Cao-\nWei throne, founded the Western Jin, and defeated Wu and Shu. Western Jin unified much of\nthe former Han territory (but not the far west); and took over Lelang and Daifang on the northern\nKorean peninsula, but shifted its entrepot for East Asian trade westward to the Liaodong\npeninsula. With the trading center further away, the Samhan turned to diplomacy: Chinhan and\nMahan sent a dozen missions to Jin between 276 and 291, for instance, each representing\nbetween three and twenty-nine of the confederated towns.\nPerhaps precisely to gain leverage in trade, the town chiefs acquiesced in increasing\ncentralization, so that the Samhan confederations became more-organized kingdoms. By 372,\nKing K\u016dnch\u2019ogo was offering tribute to Eastern Jin as the monarch of Paekche, not the\nconfederation head of Mahan. Ten years later Maripkan Naemul (356 to 402) offered tribute to\nEastern Jin as the monarch of Silla, not just the head of the Chinhan confederacy. (If he existed\nat all. He may be a myth constructed out of a scrap of a text preserved in Tang sources.)5\nDid I say offering tribute to Eastern Jin? Yes \u2013 for the general who had founded Western\nJin failed to create a stable regime. Rather than reestablishing a Qin-Han style meritocratic\nsystem of recruiting officials, he appointed 50 members of his own clan to government.\nNaturally, upon his demise, they began viciously fighting one another. All sides hired\nprofessional cavalry \u2013 men who had grown up with horses, within and along the Han northern\nborder. So it is hardly surprising that in 304, a Xiongnu general declared an independent state in\nnorth China. Over the next 12 years he captured both the old Han capitals of Luoyang and\nChang\u2019an, and the Western Jin leadership fled south to what is now Nanjing, then called\nJiankang. (Since the general\u2019s mother, he claimed, descended from Liu Bang in one of the many\nHan-Xiongnu diplomatic marriage alliances, he initially called his new state \u201cHan.\u201d)\nEastern Jin held only the area south of the Huai River. Meanwhile, the Gongsun family,\nensconced in the Liaodong peninsula, took over the Lelang commandery and divided it to form\nthe Daifang commandery in about 189. From then on, warfare was endemic, and court politics\nbecame more murderous than ever. From about 300 to 589, 37 mainland dynasties named in the\nhistories came and went, 22 of them from the steppe and Manchuria, \u2013 not to speak of many\nindependent clans and rulers who were not even reported. No dynasty held power for long.\nKogury\u014f Re-emerges\nIn this dangerous situation, the northern regimes worried about Kogury\u014f, and the\nsouthern regimes welcomed diplomats from afar as signs of their legitimacy. Kogury\u014f had re-\nemerged under King Mich\u2019\u014fn (r. 300-330). He annexed Lelang and Daifang, the remaining\nformer Han-imperial commanderies, in 313. From then until 668, it was Kogury\u014f military\npressure that gave urgency to East Asian alliances and state formation in the peninsula and\nChapter 6, p. 3 110\narchipelago. Archaeologists have found over 300 Korgury\u014f sites in Liaoning, including on the\nLiaodong peninsula: 70 mountain fortresses, over 200 tombs, and even a stone quarry.6 Like the\nZhou warring states, the various polities alternately allied and fought with one another at the\nsame time as their chiefs fought for supremacy among one another and for control of land, labor,\nand prestige goods.\nFig 6.1 King Kwanggaet\u2019o\u2019s stele in Manchuria, 414. Photo courtesy of Mark E. Byington.\nChapter 6, p. 4 111\nKogury\u014f King Kwanggaet\u2019o (r. 391\u2014 413) expanded the realm considerably. Imitating\nmainland rulers, he took a reign name (Y\u014fngnak \u6c38\u6a02 \u201cPerpetual Happiness\u201d).* We know about\nhis achievements because his son, Changsu \u201cThe Long-Lived\u201d (r. 413-499) inscribed them on\nstone in 414. Kwanggaet\u2019o fought a regime further north in Manchuria; then to support Silla\nfought Wa troops (probably allied with Kaya) and Paekche; and then fought the northern regime\nof Puy\u014f, where legend claims his ancestors had originated.\nKwanggaet\u2019o\u2019s aggression stimulated alliances and promoted state formation among his\nenemies. Paekche developed in the Mahan area. After building quite a large walled city (recently\nexcavated), it first appears in a written record when King K\u016dnch\u2019ogo contacted the Jin state in\n372. In 396, when Kogury\u014f took 58 Paekche forts and was besieging the capital, Paekche King\nAsin sent his son directly to Wa, a regime in the archipelago, to request assistance.\nIn about 400, Kogury\u014f demolished one Kaya regime, and conquered northern Paekche,\nenabling King Changsu to move the Kogury\u014f capital southwards, from the Yalu River valley to\nPyongyang on the peninsula. There, riziculture fed a larger army, which pushed Paekche yet\nfurther south. Paekche and Silla allied against Kogury\u014f in 433, and from about 400 to 500, Silla\nand Wa also joined forces. Once Silla had gained enough strength to push Kogury\u014f back up the\ncoast, it dropped Wa, which allied with Paekche instead. Each regime also sought diplomatic\nsupport from the various mainland dynasties. Kaya, for instance, sent a mission to Southern Qi\non the mainland in 479. The shifting alliances alone make one\u2019s head spin.\nBut it is still more complex. Until about 1600, Korean historians assumed that the\nSamhan confederations (Mahan, Chinhan, and Py\u014fnhan) had become the Three Kingdoms\n(Kogury\u014f, Paekche, and Silla): a nice, simple, storyline, but wrong: it was the Kaya states that\ndeveloped in the Py\u014fnhan area. The confusion was natural, because borders changed frequently,\nas kings fought one another and struggled to command local chiefs and groups. In what historian\nPark Cheun Soo calls the \u201cmutual interaction model,\u201d many small chiefs traded and fought and\nallied, across the water and up and down the peninsula. Pressure from Kogury\u014f\u2019s powerful\narmies led independent chiefs to seek alliances.\nKnowing Early Korean and Japanese History\nTexts cannot trace the process of state formation accurately, because most were written\nfar away or long afterwards, and some tell outright lies. King Kwanggaet\u2019o\u2019s stele (414) for a\nlong time was the earliest extant text directly associated with Korean history. It is a good\nprimary source for him, because it was written immediately after his death. (That does not mean\nwe have to believe everything it says.) But for Kogury\u014f\u2019s earlier history \u2013 four centuries of it \u2013\nand for a broader picture, historians must rely on archaeology and mainland written sources.\nThe evidence is even weaker for Silla. No archaeological or mainland evidence supports\nthe claim that Silla was founded in 57 BC. The earliest extant stone inscription from Silla was\ncarved five centuries later, in 501; the first steles to mention the existence of a Silla founding\nancestor date to 568; and that ancestor only gets a name another century later.7 The first\nsubstantial narratives of Korean history were written (in classical Chinese) in 1145 (\u201cHistory of\nthe Three Kingdoms\u201d Samguk sagi\u4e09\u570b\u53f2\u8a18, with \u201csagi\u201d being the Korean pronunciation of\n*Kwanggaet\u2019o\u2019s full title was \u570b\u5ca1\u4e0a\u5ee3\u958b\u571f\u5883\u5e73\u5b89\u597d\u592a\u738b.\nChapter 6, p. 5 112\nSima Qian\u2019s Shiji), and 1279 (\u201cMemorabilia of the Three Kingdoms\u201d Samguk yusa\u4e09\u570b\u907a\u4e8b).\nUsing such late sources requires great care. For instance, historian Jonathan Best has shown that\nthe early portions of the \u201cAnnals of Silla\u201d in the Samguk sagi were fabricated by taking\nsequences of events for which there really were records (after 545), changing people\u2019s names\nand postdating by multiples of 60 years, so that they could retain the dates in the sexagenary\ncycle that dates back to Shang. Using those ready-made narratives, compilers filled in 500 years\nof \u201chistory\u201d in a way that looked realistic. This fake news became the official history of Silla.8\nJapan\u2019s process of state-building started later, but written records survive from earlier.\nThe \u201cRecord of Ancient Affairs\u201d (Kojiki \u53e4\u4e8b\u8a18) of 712 and the \u201cChronicle of Japan\u201d (Nihon\nShoki \u65e5\u672c\u66f8\u7d00) of 720 draw on some earlier texts (now lost), but used in isolation they are not\nreliable. For instance, the Nihon Shoki records that one \u201cEmpress Jing\u016b\u201d conquered Kaya in the\n300s AD, creating a colony called Mimana (\u201cImna\u201d in Korean). An immense amount of ink has\nbeen spilt on this idea that \u201cJapan\u201d conquered part of \u201cKorea.\u201d Hideyoshi\u2019s invasion of Chos\u014fn\nin 1592, and the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910, make the debate emotionally and\npolitically charged. Some Japanese and Korean scholars now agree: \u201cthe Japanese commandery\nof Mimana\u201d was an administrative office for Wa envoys visiting one of the Kaya statelets.9\nIn fact there was no one \u201cJapan,\u201d and no one \u201cKorea,\u201d nor one \u201cChina\u201d after Han fell.\nNor were there clear Chinese, Japanese, or Korean ethnicities or cultures. Rather, as armed and\nmounted elites dominated workers, and pushed and shoved at each other, cultures changed in\ncomplicated ways. Archaeological data are hard to interpret but cannot lie: they show that the\nchiefs and states of East Asia interacted in numerous ways for a long time.\nCultural Variation in the Mainland\nMainland culture varied. I will give two examples. First, look at \u201cThe Sixteen\nDynasties:\u201d 23 short-lived regimes in parts of the north and Sichuan between 304 and 439,\nfounded by nine different ethnic groups. The Ba state in Sichuan (304-349) was founded by\npeople who worshipped a tiger spirit, specialized in hunting and boating, and followed Celestial\nMaster Daoism. Back in the Warring States period, they had had their own script (Figure 6.1)\nFig 6.2 Ba writing (?). It has not been deciphered and may not be a writing system at all! What elements\nin these examples make it look like it is or is not? Source: Terry Kleeman, Great Perfection, 38. Fair Use.\nChapter 6, p. 6 113\nBut they adopted Chinese characters, spoke a variety of Chinese, fought for Liu Bang in\nfounding the Han dynasty, worked for the Han state as soldiers and officials; and then rebelled\nfrequently in the Latter Han period, before founding their own state. Ba families took on varying\ndegrees of Han practices and beliefs.10 The Ba are only one of many groups on the mainland\nwho moved in and out of independence, changing and intermarrying all the while.\nFig. 6.2 Excavated \u201cCheng-Han yong\u201d \u6210\u6f22\u4fd1statues that may represent Ba people.

Each is unique, but all have five mouths \u2013 a custom of Han times (see Figure 6.3).\nFigure 6.3 Latter (Eastern) Han hunping\u201d a \u201cfive-linked jar.\u201d Held by Ningbo Municipal Museum.\nSource: Keith Knapp, \u201cThe Meaning of Birds.\u201d Used by permission of the author & photographer.\nChapter 6, p. 7 114\nFigure 6.4 Western Jin hunping, excavated in Ningbo, Zhejiang, and held at the Ningbo Municipal\nMuseum. What and whom does it depict? Can you see its relation to the five-linked jar? Source: Keith\nKnapp, \u201cThe Meaning of Birds.\u201d Used by permission of the author and photographer.\nSupernatural animals on later jars include dragons, the single-hearted double bird, the qilin, and\nothers. Natural animals include dogs, sheep, turtles, monkeys, chickens, slugs, crabs, lions \u2013 and\nlots of birds. In Western Jin times, birds replaced most of the other animals (see Figure 6.4),\nleaving only what scholars have called bears. Scholars searching the Sinitic written tradition say\nthat the birds represent the human soul flying up to heaven, but then why so many? And why do\nbirds also appear on objects not made for burial? And what about the bears?\nRecently, historian Keith Knapp has interpreted the funerary jars in terms of local culture.\nJiangnan legends tell that early humans were starving: the gods ate rice, but they would not share\nit. Sparrows pitied people, stole rice from heaven, and brought it down to earth, and rats helped\ndistribute it. Birds therefore symbolized grain, and fertility: childless couples would pray to the\n\u201cGod who Delivers Grain\u201d and the husband would eat a male sparrow. The jars also include\nminiature imitation stone steles, saying things like: \u201cWealth and Happiness, may there be dukes\nand lords, many sons and grandsons, long life, and may there be no misfortune for a thousand\nhundred-thousand ten-thousand years.\u201d The jars brought good luck for the living, who could tend\nthe dead. Birds on funerary jars brought blessings in Jiangnan culture. But the practice died out\nafter migrants from the north swamped the area.11\nThe spread of the Sinitic tradition of literature, ritual, and governance changed cultures\nboth within the mainland and across East Asia. When cultures changed to align with texts, we\nChapter 6, p. 8 115\ncan see it, or we think we can, in new texts within the tradition, such as the histories of the\npeople of the Korean and Japanese regimes. But throughout history, ordinary people lived with\nthe elite as servants and nannies and wetnurses and they taught them their local stories, songs,\nlanguages, and foodways. Customs in cooking, clothing, song and dance, rituals of birth,\nmarriage, and coming of age and the like have left little trace in writing; so the impact of\nordinary people on the elite is harder to see.\nThe Mainland: Aristocracy Returns\nThe Sino-Steppe Empire of the Northern Mainland\nAs the elite of the Korean Three Kingdoms (Paekche, Silla and Kogury\u014f) and Wa on the\narchipelago were learning how to control more people and territory, so too on the mainland each\ndynasty tried out new ways to control land and labor. Both wealth-based class and violence-\nbased domination increasingly cloaked themselves in hereditary rank. In contrast to Qin and Han\ntimes, people were increasingly born into a status in life they could not escape. Aristocracy had\nreturned.\nThe Cao-Wei monarchy (220-265) was no more able than Han to end great-clan power\nand return to a Legalist-style meritocratic, bureaucratic state. So it invented new institutions that\ncould provide the state with soldiers, grain and cloth, and personnel, while reinforcing clan\nlandownership and power. First, on the military side, the Cao-Wei assured a supply of soldiers\nby making that occupation hereditary: a brother or son would replace each soldier or commander\nwho died or could no longer fight. Military families were granted farmland, and permitted to\nmarry only into other military families. Essentially, soldiers became a separate caste. This\nseparation occurred even before the formation of warrior dynasties that sprang from the steppe.\nSecond, with respect to labor, the Cao-Wei state took over direct ownership of land that\nhad been laid waste by war, or whose owners had fled or died. Landless people and war captives\nworked that land as tenants, paying rent directly to the government. Most Northern regimes both\norganized vast state plantations to tightly control the common people\u2019s labor, and parceled out\nland and labor to officials. Beginning with the disarray of late Han, the great clans had been\ngathering refugees as their personal troops and dependents, sheltering them in fortified villages\nin exchange for half of the harvest. The central state of Cao-Wei, inheriting from Han, no longer\nhad a direct relationship with these people; it could not count, let alone command them.\nThird, with respect to taxation, although Han had collected some taxes in money,\nrepeated debasements and counterfeiting had undermined faith in copper coinage. So Cao-Wei\ntaxed families stopped producing coins, and collected taxes on family wealth in fine silk cloth.\nFor centuries, silk would be used as money.\nFourth, to staff the government, the Cao-Wei continued to recruit men of good reputation\nand learning. But whereas in Han individual men recommended from localities were graded and\nposted by the center, now local inspectors graded men into nine ranks of quality. The power of\nsome clans meant that rank, and even particular offices, began again to become inherited. A\nman\u2019s family determined his rank; the upper ranks held the highest offices. Furthermore, noble\nfamilies (shi \u58eb, the old word for Zhou knights) were exempt from some taxes, as well as from\nlabor for the state, and were legally superior to commoners (shu \u5eb6). The Qin and Han equality\nunder law was gone.\nChapter 6, p. 9 116\nAs hereditary rank distinctions strengthened, steppe people and former subjects of Han\nintermingled. A century or so after Cao-Wei fell to Jin, a Xianbei clan established themselves as\nthe Tuoba Wei or Northern Wei dynasty (386-534). They reunified the northern mainland as far\nas the Gansu corridor. Like Kogury\u014f, Tuoba Wei moved its capital several times, and combined\nagriculture with hunting and herding; state herds had millions of head of sheep, horses, cattle and\ncamels. Tuoba Wei herded people, too, relocating to their new capital near Datong in Shanxi a\nmillion people from Manchuria, the northern mainland, and the northern peninsula, including\n100,000 skilled artisans. These war captives were granted to generals, officials, and aristocrats,\nand they and their children served in hereditary occupations as clerks, weavers and artisans,\nmusicians and actors. The regime also succeeded in turning steppe clans into a loyal military\ncaste. And it employed as officials the highly-educated members of the great clans formerly of\nthe Han regime, experienced in governing. And in farming: owning and managing land\nthemselves, the elite promoted knowledge about farming, for instance in an encyclopedia called\nKnowledge Needed by Ordinary People (Qimin yaoshu).12 The Sino-Steppe empire under Tuoba\nWei combined the Sinitic heritage of literature and governing techniques with nomadic legacies\nand new ways to control and manage land and labor.\nLike all dynasties in this period across East Asia, the Tuoba Wei rulers faced challenges\nfrom their own ruling class elites. The clans\u2019 power and wealth continued to grow, and the\nTuoba Wei regime struggled to control land and labor. It designated as many people as possible\nfree commoners (labelled \u201crespectable people\u201d \u826f\u6c11), restricting the category of \u201cmean\u201d or\n\u201cbase\u201d people (\u8ce4\u6c11) to slaves, convicts, and their families. They gave respectable commoners\nland grants in exchange for tax payments in grain and cloth under the \u201cequal fields\u201d system.\n(Grain land returned to the state when the household head died, but land used for hemp or\nmulberry did not: an asymmetry related to gendered production.) Still the big clans dominated\nnominally free people and their land allocations, and even claimed larger allocations themselves\non the basis of their labor power in the form of slaves and oxen. As free people moved to the\nwasteland the central state could really hand out, the big clans turned even more to slave labor.\nInherited wealth and rank further undermined the independence of free commoners, and their\nnumbers shrank. Rulers across East Asia struggled to maintain a tax base of smallholders, for\ntheir own aristocrats had enough power to refuse to pay.\nOver the course of the period, the distinction between noble families and commoners, and\nincreasingly fine distinctions among aristocratic ranks, became ever firmer in state practice and\nin elite thinking. (We don\u2019t know what the non-elite thought.) Even when Dowager Empress\nFeng (r. 466-90), for instance, encouraged intermarriage among Xianbei nobility and nobility of\nthe big clans dating back to Han times, she also required that people marry only into families of\nthe same rank.13 Rank was real; ethnicity was changeable. The warrior and former-Han elite\nlearned one another\u2019s ways and languages, wrote poetry, studied the Classics, and practiced\nfamily ritual as well as warrior arts. The cultural convergence went too far for some soldiers\u2019\ntaste, and a mutiny brought down the Wei, but it was replaced by other warrior regimes that also\ncooperated with the settled aristocracy. The connections of later northern dynasties reached even\nfurther: Empress Ashina of the Northern Zhou in the 560s may have been related to a wife of one\nof the Sassanid emperors of Persia about the same time, and to the later Empress Theodora, wife\nof the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II a century later.14 Aristocrats married outside their ethnic\ngroup to form alliances; marrying far outside one\u2019s hereditary rank did not strengthen family\nalliances.\nChapter 6, p. 10 117\nThe Jiankang Empire of the Southern Mainland\n\u201cSouth of the River\u201d or Jiangnan, which later referred to the area around the Yangzi\ndelta, for Sima Qian in the Shiji and in subsequent centuries meant \u201cSouth of the Huai River,\u201d\n150 miles further north. The area below the Huai had been lightly touched by Qin-Han\ngovernance. The Qin roads that went in five directions from the capital had reached as far south\nas today\u2019s Guangzhou (Canton), but as a lonely finger of influence, with most of the area below\nthe Yangzi untouched. The first empire had concentrated its efforts on flat, arable land for easy\ngrain production. Controlling people in flatlands is easier than in hills, too.\nWhere fertile wetlands abounded, rice farming had long combined with fishing, hunting,\nand foraging for wild foods. Agriculture intensified as some migrants fled south in late Han, as\nthe Wu dynasty tried to increase taxes to fight Wei and Shu in the Three Kingdoms period (222-\n280), and especially when Xianbei and Xiongnu generals captured the old capitals of Chang\u2019an\nin 306 and Luoyang five years later, pillaging and murdering. The Western Jin aristocratic clans\n\u2013perhaps 60% of the elite \u2013 and their many dependents, tenants, slaves, and servants moved bag\nand baggage to found a new, southern capital called Jiankang, today\u2019s Nanjing. The arrival of a\nnew, demanding elite who, initially, wanted to raise troops to retake their homeland, meant that\nofficials energetically registered farmers and pushed intensified labor to increase surplus rice.\nAs in pre-imperial Qin and Yamato Japan, therefore, warfare promoted rice agriculture.\nCulturally, Southerners differed from Northerners, and also varied widely in their family\npatterns, languages, religions, and degree of organization.15 Heartily disdaining southern food,\nculture, language, and people, the immigrant elite planned to stay for only a while to keep alive\nthe flame of true civilization: the written, ritual, and governing traditions of Zhou and Han.\nBut they stayed for centuries. And they changed: they learned southern ways, and locals\nlearned to read and govern in the Sinitic tradition. Together, immigrants and southerners created\nan empire centered on Jiankang, today\u2019s Nanjing on the Yangzi River: by the year 500, that\ncapital alone housed 800,000 people, almost as many as the later Tang capital of Chang\u2019an.\nHistorian Andrew Chittick has labelled the south between the fall of Han and Sui unification\ncourts \u201cthe Jiankang Empire.\u201d16 The dynasties changed, but the structure of the empire persisted\nuntil Jiankang city was brutally conquered and burned by the Sui founders in 589.\nThe Jiankang empire had a number of characteristics that distinguished it from the Sino-\nSteppe empire. First, a system of garrisons along the Huai and Yellow Rivers protected it from\nnorthern cavalry. Men serving in the garrisons developed a distinct culture, with particular gods,\nrituals, and military values. They admired not just sheer bravery in battle, but the ability to\nmanage logistics, planning for sieges and protecting supply lines. So they developed close\nrelations with the merchants who plied the myriad waterways of the fertile south.\nSecond, as those military-merchant relations suggest, in the fertile south with its\nincreasing productivity in rice, commerce throve. Aristocrats made beautiful things themselves,\nand patronized artists and craftspeople. Around Hangzhou bay, paper was made, and hundreds\nof kilns produced beautiful ceramics. Artisans who made bronze mirrors were so prized that\nsome were recruited to migrate, even to the archipelago. The Southern dynasties collected\ncommercial taxes as traders from Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East carried goods\nChapter 6, p. 11 118\nback and forth from as far away as the Mediterranean. The largest port may have been near\nHanoi. Aristocrats benefitted from commerce as they consolidated the social value of rank.\nThird, money generated by commerce flowed from bottom to top through patron-client\nnetworks that coexisted with and shaped the state. These were networks of power in which court\npatrons \u2013 often younger princes who were not in line to inherit the throne and were sent out to\nserve in garrisons \u2013 developed personal relationships with officials and with military men.\nWithin the nominally bureaucratic system, officials gathered taxes as they could and passed\nmoney up to patrons at court. Court patrons and military men were linked by shared experiences\nand military values, but also by money that passed from merchants to soldiers and up to princes.\nFourth, the five changes of dynasty and more frequent unseatings of the ruler, which\nsuggest instability, actually grew systematically out of these wide-reaching patron-client ties.\nBecause the heir-apparent of the current dynasty remained in Jiankang in accordance with Sinitic\ntradition, he could not form personal patron-client relations with military men. That meant that\nin almost every generation from 420 to 589, the eldest son was displaced by a younger brother or\ncousin whose time in the garrisons had allowed him to build up a coterie of military clients.\nApparent instability masked a fundamental continuity of government.\nFifth, the struggle for power at court engaged rulers, would-be rulers, and other members\nof the elite in three distinct modes of legitimation. One: The northern immigrants brought with\nthem, retained, promulgated, and added to the whole Sinitic literary and governing tradition.\nProtected by the garrisons and in some ways politically marginalized, northerners and their\ndescendants, as well as southerners who learned the Sinitic tradition, created a rich cultural\nblooming of poetry, calligraphy, painting, dance, music, elegant styles of debate, and other arts.\nThey did Confucian family ritual and deployed the Han ritual tradition to legitimate the ruler of\nthe day and the regime as a whole. Two: local gods and their myths \u2013 including a local general\ndeified after his death \u2013 persisted and grew, and became part of legitimation strategies. And\nthree: as all across East Asia at the time, southern rulers increasingly presented themselves as\npatrons of Buddhism, in modes drawn from southeast Asia.\nThe north, of course, drew its Buddhist traditions more from Central Asia. In this and\nother aspects, the Jiankang empire went its own way. Chittick believes, although not all\nhistorians agree, that its aristocracy had little interest in restoring Qin/Han-style empire, but\nregarded the north as a foreign land. They vigorously defended the area south of the Huai, but\ndid not try to conquer the north. The north, likewise, had little hope or perhaps even little dream\nof conquering the south. As historian Hugh R. Clark writes, \u201cNorth and south, in short, had gone\nseparate ways. \u2018China\u2019 was not one.\u201d17\nA Witness to Suffering\nIn talking of ritual, faith, legitimation, and learning, we should not forget the brutality and\nviolence that attended the competition for power in the era of a divided mainland. One example\nis the Hou Jing Rebellion of 548, which sprang from one civil war in the north, and precipitated\nanother in the south.\nWhat happened was this: Northern Wei dynasty, ruling the Sino-Steppe empire, had\nbroken into two states, the Western Wei centered on Chang\u2019an and the Eastern Wei. General\nHou Jing of the Eastern Wei defected first to the Western Wei and then to Emperor Wu of the\nChapter 6, p. 12 119\nLiang dynasty, ruling the Jiankang empire. Then he rebelled against Liang, besieging and\nconquering Jiankang city, leaving it in ruins. When Emperor Wu of Liang died, Hou Jing\ncontrolled the heir, Prince Xiao Gang, as his puppet. Prince Xiao Yi came to his brother\u2019s aid\nonly after eliminating other brothers and cousins, but finally defeated Hou Jing in 552. Xiao Yi\nthen took the throne, but instead of returning to Jiankang, he settled in Jiangling, about 500 miles\neast. This was his own power base, where he had served as governor. His younger brother Xiao\nJi imitated him; as governor of Yizhou in Sichuan he, too, declared himself the new emperor of\nthe Liang dynasty. Xiao Yi responded by allying with the Western Wei against his brother,\nwhich allowed the Wei to take control of the Sichuan area that had been so central to imperial\npower going back to Qin times, because of its extraordinary productivity.18 Despite the fact that\nthe elite families of both the Sino-Steppe and Jiankang empires prided themselves on their\nConfucian and Buddhist learning, and legitimated their power through Confucian and Buddhist\nrituals, when it came to fighting for supreme power all those values amounted to naught as\nbrother fought brother to the detriment of the whole family and realm.\nFor, naturally, the Wei regime then turned on Xiao Yi himself, conquering Jiangling in\n554 and looting its imperial treasures. Wei marched over one hundred thousand able-bodied\nJiangling people back to Chang\u2019an after killing those who were weak or young. About a quarter\nof the captives died on the march; most of the others became slaves of Wei generals and soldiers.\nXiao Yi himself the Wei executed by suffocation. His last act before being captured had been to\nset fire to the 140,000 scrolls of books in the Liang imperial library. That destruction grieved a\nscholar who had been working in that library for two years, Yan Zhitui (531-590s). A Jiangling\nresident and member of a clan originally from Shandong, whose service to various dynasties\n(and clashes with their rulers over matters of principle) stretched back nine generations to about\n300, Yan had narrowly escaped murder by Hou Jing\u2019s soldiers and was among the captives taken\nby Wei. His Family Instructions and other writings record the terrible experiences of himself\nand others. He tells, for example, of a father and son, the only members of a family to survive\nthe Hou Jing Rebellion. The father carried his little boy on the march to Chang\u2019an until a Wei\nsoldier tore him away and threw him into the snow, whipping the father as he pleaded for his\nson\u2019s life. The father died soon after of his injuries and grief.19\nYan Zhitui himself was valuable to rulers because of his learning in the Sinitic tradition,\nwhich had passed down in the family for generations. The Western Wei regime placed him on\nthe staff of a general. When the Eastern Wei was placed by the Northern Qi dynasty, Yan heard\nthat Qi had decided to send home the Liang people it held, so he Yan escaped to Qi, taking his\nfamily by boat on the Yellow River and travelling over two hundred miles in one night. But\nonce he was at the Qi capital, he heard that a general named Chen had deposed the Liang\nemperor and established his own dynasty. Yan stayed and served Qi by assisting with several\nliterary compilations; he again narrowly escaped dying, this time when six colleagues were\nexecuted for remonstrating with the Qi emperor. When Zhou replaced the Western Wei and\nwiped out Qi, Yan was brought back to Chang\u2019an. There he found his brother, but mourned that\nhe had worked for three failed states and could never return home. He worked in the Censorate\n(the arm of government that oversaw all others) for the Zhou regime and then for Sui, which\nreunited north and south.20\nYan was a devout Buddhist. But he regarded learning in the Sinitic tradition as essential\nto maintaining what he held most dear: his \u201cdeeply rooted sense of elite family identity.\u201d 21 His\nChapter 6, p. 13 120\nadvice to his sons centered on how they could maintain their literate learning, correct\npronunciation (i.e., that of Luoyang before the Jin fled south), and elite manners and family\nrituals: how to properly refer to ancestors and address living relatives, how celebrate birthdays,\nhow to mourn when a relative died, how to weep when parting. What we think of as key\nConfucian values \u2013 filiality, ancestral sacrifice, loyalty to one ruler or one dynasty \u2013 were not his\nfocus. Yan, a gentleman of his time, cared most about literary culture and family pride.\nFig 6.5 Han bronze mirror with supernatural beings, animals, and inscription. Late second century.

To figure out interactions among people of different areas, ordinary\nobjects like clay storage jars and tiles, too heavy and cheap to be worth carrying, reveal more.\nArchaeologists note how pottery techniques and styles vary from place to place, and change over\ntime in one place. If a style of everyday pottery whose development can be traced in place A\nsuddenly shows up in place B, we conclude that someone travelled from A to B, bringing along a\nway of making pottery. If the style develops further in B, we conclude that she or he settled in\nand taught others, each generation changing it slightly. Shared architectural features \u2013 styles of\nChapter 6, p. 15 122\ntombs and houses \u2013 likewise indicate direct contact between people of different places. Tomb\nstyles are especially conservative, since the peaceful rest of the dead is at stake; dramatic,\npermanent changes suggest that people have moved. Archaeologists also assume that ritual\nobjects developed in place A suddenly appear in place B, the same rituals and the same meanings\nof the ritual have been carried by people from one place to another.22\nThe rulers of the Korean Three Kingdoms (Kogury\u014f, Paekche, and Silla), as well as the\nrulers of Kaya and Wa, increased their power first by displaying and distributing goods \u2013 like\nbronze mirrors, \u2013 whether made at home or imported, to increase their prestige and influence;\nthen by importing mainland technology and improving and multiplying bronze weapons, iron\nweapons, and iron tools; then by monopolizing the increased production that iron made possible\nby adopting governing techniques of counting and controlling people. Finally, they took on the\nwhole Sinitic literate and governing tradition, which then changed in their hands.\nWe can easily understand how controlling weapons was useful in fighting other chiefs, or\ncowing farmers and workers. But how did prestige goods like bronze mirrors create power?\nEast Asia did not have a commercial, money-based economy in which wealth translated\ndirectly into high social status (as we imagine our society today to be). Rather, prestige goods,\noften inherited or acquired as gifts or as booty, created a sense of awe. Everyone sees the value\nof the material and the great skill of the artisans. They index command of violence and resources\nfor those who had some idea how to make them, and for those who did not, they may have\nsignaled some extra-human power. The political order was unstable, which is a fancy way of\nsaying that chiefs gained and lost power. Even the rules of inheritance within one group were not\nfixed. To gain and maintain real and symbolic predominance, chiefs and kings relied on a\nconstant stream of prestige goods, much as Xiongnu chief Modun had held his confederation\ntogether with a steady supply of tribute from the Han empire.\nA canny leader (call him a king) would take control of a trade route, develop an alliance\nthat could supply goods as gifts, seize goods from a neighbor by force of arms, or capture\nartisans who knew how to make things. He passed goods to his elite followers, who could pass\nsome down to smaller chiefs below them. But each king could be replaced; loyalty was\ntemporary. The chiefs were not bureaucrats whom the king closely controlled; if he gave a chief\na gold-frilled crown to signify his authority that was all very well, but how could the king take it\nback if the chief turned against him? To authorize a new subordinate ally, the king would need a\nnew gold-frilled crown (or silver cap with comma-shaped jades, or whatever the current fashion\nin empowering headgear was).\nFurthermore, both prestige goods and practical things like iron and armor were always\nbeing buried with kings and chiefs. That is how we know about them, after all! The successor\nking or chief wanted to make a good show for the allies and subordinates whom archaeologists\nassume attended funerals. Power depended on displaying and sharing wealth, so no successor\nking could afford to bury his predecessor in a small, cheap tomb with a paltry assortment of\ngrave goods: that would signal weakness. No matter how many display items the dead king or\nchief had amassed, the next one still needed more. For instance, when the Han commanderies of\nLelang and Daifang on the peninsula collapsed under attacks by Kogury\u014f, Wa chiefs around\nsouthern Nara, who held the upper hand in the archipelago at that point, were cut off from their\nChapter 6, p. 16 123\nsupply of Chinese prestige objects, including specific types of mirrors. They lost power to the\nclans in the Kinai region, who had suppliers from the Kumgwan Kaya state.\nBronze Mirrors and Gold Crowns\nThe most common signs of authority were bronze mirrors \u2013 disks cast with one decorated\nside and one flat side polished to reflect. Mirrors had originally been created in the steppe, and\nhad spread to Shang. Thousands were cast in Han times, with patterns that incorporated wishes\nfor longevity and prosperity, cosmological ideas about the five phases and five directions, and\niconography of the cult of the Queen Mother of the West, as well as other themes. The Lelang\ncommandery funneled bronze mirrors from the mainland to the Samhan and over to Kyushu in\nthe archipelago. Eventually, craftsmen in the peninsula and archipelago produced them, too.\nHundreds of cast bronze mirrors have been excavated in the archipelago from Late\nYayoi-period (c. AD 100 \u2013 350) and Tomb Period (c. AD 300-580) graves, sometimes a dozen\nor more arranged around the coffin. Mirrors imported from the mainland typically bear\ninscriptions of three kinds. How would you describe these types?\n1. [May you have] sons and grandsons for a long time!\n[May you] live as long as metal and stone!\n[May you] win high office!\nAbove, [may you] accord with the serried constellations; below, avoid\nmisfortune.\n2. Establishing Stability era, 7th year [AD 202], 9th month, 26th day. I made this\nbright mirror, refining pure bronze a hundred times.\n3. The court manufactory made this mirror; it has its own principle.\nIt fends off misfortune, and is fit to sell at market.\n[Above] are the King Father of the East and Queen Mother of the West.\nIt lets You reflect yourself. May you have many descendants.\nMainland mirrors often used wrong characters that sounded the same, but when the mirrors were\ncopied on the archipelago, the texts got even more interesting.\nFor instance, can you figure out what two changes happened, and why, to create the\nfollowing inscription (translated into English), on two identical mirrors made in the archipelago?\nI edam thgirb rorrim yrev lausunu evreserp snos dna snosdnarg htlaew tuohtiw timil erar\u2020\nMirrors made in the archipelago also sometimes included meaningless, made-up characters,\ncalled \u201cpseudo-inscriptions.\u201d Lurie refers to all these kinds of inscriptions as \u201calegible,\u201d\nmeaning that legibility was not really their function. That is, most owners or viewers did not\n\u2020 Here\u2019s the answer. 1. The inscription that was copied described the mirror as \u201cunusual and\nrare,\u201d but the person making the mold first left out the \u201crare\u201d and then just stuck it in at the end.\n2.The mold to cast the mirror was made without taking into account the reversal from right to\nleft that would occur, so the characters are backward. See Lurie, Realms of Literacy, 60-61.\nChapter 6, p. 17 124\nread the words, nor want to.23 Rather, like the mirrors themselves, characters were strange and\ninteresting, and symbolized magical power or foreign connections.\nKings and chiefs also liked gold. Plenty of it washed down in the streams of the\npeninsula; more gold ornaments have been found in Silla tombs and sites than in those of any\nother culture in the world. Archaeologists trace Silla\u2019s alliances largely by finds of their amazing\ngold crowns in tombs in Paekche and the archipelago.\nFig. 6.6 Silla wooden-chamber Hwangnamdaechong tomb with stone mound, c. 400. Double tomb for\nking and queen. The queen has an extra chamber for grave goods. She was buried wearing a crown, a\nbelt, bracelets, rings, necklaces, and a chestlace, all made of gold.

Their decorations of\ntrees, deer, and birds suggest influences from Central Asia, while Silla earrings look like those of\nSouth Asian maritime cultures.24 Silla also used gold for horse-fittings like cheek-straps. During\nthe periods of Silla-Wa alliance, gold crowns, necklaces, earrings, hair ornaments and finger\nrings; gilt-bronze saddle-frames, quivers, helmets with visors, and other kinds of armor and horse\ngear; iron ingots; and glass cups all travelled from Silla to Wa chiefs around Osaka and Nara. In\nreturn, Wa sent comma-shaped jade beads and soldiers who helped Silla push Kogury\u014f away\nfrom the eastern coast.25 Silks, too, passed from ruler to rulers, in the form of banners declaring\ntheir titles, ribbons tied onto gold seals, or lengths of cloth to make into clothing.\nBronze, gold, and silk indexed power. If worked in exotic styles, they showed the\nsubordinates of a ruler that he had access to wealth through trade or conquest, and if in local\nstyles that he controlled the artisans who could make such things. When a king granted gold and\nChapter 6, p. 18 125\nbronze to lesser chiefs, they deployed it to impress those below them. Prestige objects created\npower through social processes; they did not merely symbolize it.\nFig. 6.7 Silla queen\u2019s solid gold crown from the Hwangnamdaechong tomb.

Bronze was practical, as well as symbolic. But\nin the peninsula, bronze made little impact until shortly before the arrival of iron, and the two\nmetals arrived at about the same time in the archipelago, around 400 BC. Iron in ingots was a\nprestige good, buried in Samhan and Wa tombs. (The precise shape, style, and composition of\niron ingots tells archaeologists where they were made.) As the northern dynasties used silk for\ncurrency, so iron ingots and tools served as money in the markets of the Samhan. But iron not\nonly indexed power to create it socially; it also armed soldiers and fed them.\nThe centrality of iron appears in a story that the Silla kings had an ancestor who had\nworked as an iron-smelter, and who after death was worshipped as a smelting deity. But it was\nKaya, in particular, that produced and traded enormous quantities of iron: enough to bury\nweapons and armor with rulers, and good enough to export even to the commanderies, which\nsurely had access to iron made in the mainland. The iron trade was so important to Kaya that\nChapter 6, p. 19 126\nplacement along trade routes \u2013 rather than, say, military strategic advantage or rich natural\nresources \u2013 determined which communities within the Kaya region rose to prominence.\nIron was not the only item that Samhan had to offer. Samhan towns close to the coast\nbecame wealthy by exporting large chestnuts, fine-tailed chickens, grain, a few bronze items, and\nbeautiful glass beads in blue and red, sometimes incorporating gold leaf. From the mainland\nthey imported tin, horse-fittings, bronze mirrors, and other luxury goods, and from about AD\n200-300, the boat-savvy inhabitants of Tsushima and other small islands took on the role of\nmiddlemen between Kyushu and the commanderies, and even the mainland proper. It is not\nclear what Wa had to offer in exchange for prestige goods and iron: probably local foods,\nlumber, and perhaps manpower. Paekche King Muryong, for instance, had a fine coffin of\nJapanese pinewood, and Wa warriors may have served various sides in peninsular battles.\nTo be clear: neither mainland, nor peninsula, nor archipelago kings dominated those of\nthe other regions. All sides gained wealth and prestige from exchanges.\nAs time went on, the goods exchanged between the mainland and peninsula became more\nelaborate and displayed greater cultural knowledge. Take Paekche as an example. Paekche sent\na mission to the Jiankang empire once every five to ten years from about AD 350 to 660.\nRoyalty or the descendants of mainlanders led the missions, accompanied by aristocrats. Twice,\nwhen the military situation was critical, crown princes went. Missions requested specific\nweapons; titles like \u201cKing of Paekche\u201d and \u201cGreat General Pacifying the East;\u201d garments\nshowing those ranks; a divination text and commentaries on Buddhist sutras; skilled artisans and\nritual masters; someone to teach the Book of Odes. In return, Paekche gave, among other things,\nmusicians to play at enthronement ceremonies. We know mainland rulers wanted the connection,\nbecause they granted titles to five Paekche kings even before missions arrived to request them.\nTo get a little ahead of the story, the mainland connection with Paekche continued into\nTang, still serving both sides. To the young Tang, King Mu of Paekche sent miniature horses\ncalled \u201cunder the fruit horses;\u201d special, highly burnished iron armor; highly-decorated (in\nchasing) battle-axes; and a golden suit of armor (iron with gold lacquer). Tang Taizong was so\npleased that, in return, he sent King Mu 3,000 pieces of silk and a special silk-brocade robe.\nWhen an embassy came to report King Mu\u2019s death in 641, Tang Taizong donned a white\nmourning robe, issued a eulogy in a public ceremony, and granted Mu a posthumous title.\nPaekche also sent gifts to the archipelago. The Seven-Branched Sword went to a Wa king\nin 369 (Fig. 6.8). A blade with no haft, about 2 feet long, it is held by a shrine in Nara, where it\nwas cleaned rather carelessly in 1874, losing some words from its gold-inlaid inscription:\nIn the fourth year of the Great Harmony era [AD 369], in the [\u2026] month, on the\n16th day, the 43rd of the cycle, at noon, was made this seven-branched sword of\nmultiply-refined iron. [May you] avoid injury in battle. It is suitable for a\nmarquis or a king. [\u2026] made it. From ages past there has never before been a\nsword like this one. The Crown Prince of Paekche, Sagely Kusu, had it made\nespecially for King Zhi of Wa. Pass it down and display it to later generations.26\nMore on inscribed swords later\u2026 But note here that the maker\u2019s name was recorded, although it\nis now illegible. Such work was skilled, and rulers and warriors recognized those skills.\nChapter 6, p. 20 127\nFigure 6.8 The Seven-Branched Sword, granted to a Wa ruler by Paekche in 369.

Boats in\nmodels and drawings on Japanese haniwa (clay tomb figures) show oars and maybe masts.\nFig 6.9 Boats incised on haniwa from a tomb mound (tumulus) in Japan. The scholarly chapter that\nincludes these drawings mentions only oars, but I see sails. Or are they just banners? What do you think?\nWhat is that bird for?

One could not travel too far out or too long; the oarsmen needed to rest\nChapter 6, p. 21 128\nand eat. Setting out from northern Kyushu and its islets, Wa ships could first set anchor in Kaya\nto rest, resupply, and do a little trading; then stop at other places along the western coast of the\npeninsula; and finally make their way up the K\u016dm River to the Paekche capital. Or Wa\nmerchants and diplomats might change to a boat owned by Kaya or Paekche rulers or merchants\nalong the way. At one Paekche harbor site dating to 400-600, archaeologists have found stone\nritual tools of a kind used in ancestral worship in coastal Kyushu. Ships carrying Wa sailors or\ntraders must have stopped there so they could offer prayers to their ancestors for a safe trip.\nWe know even less about such people than about their social superiors, buried in tombs\nthat recorded their lives, alliances, and values. But increasing power for kings and increasing\ninheritance of status surely meant decreasing autonomy for ordinary people.\nFrom Chiefs to Queen and Kings in the Archipelago\nQueen Himiko of Wa \u2013 the Tomb Period\nAcross central Japan, about 20,000 keyhole-shaped tombs called kofun still exist. The\nperiod in which they were built \u2013 about AD 250-500 \u2013 is called the Tomb Period. Such\nenormous tombs mean that social differentiation had made some chiefs powerful enough to\ncommand the labor to build them and the goods to furnish them. Some of the keyhole tombs\nhave been excavated, and it is noteworthy that they include thousands of clay haniwa figures of\nhumans, horses, and so on \u2013 not, as in the case of Shang and Zhou tombs, human sacrifices. Do\nyou have thoughts about why that might be?\nAs Kaya sent rice, iron, and other technology to the archipelago, the goods stimulated\nsocial differentiation and then fighting among chiefs. In about 190, various clans or statelets in\nthe Nara area joined together to diminish conflict by choosing someone to place above them all:\nQueen Himiko (r. 190 \u2013 248), the first Japanese individual named in written history.\nAccording to a mainland history, Queen Himiko\u2019s leadership sprang from her shamanic\naccess to spirits. She kept herself apart, isolated by taboos, so that she could settle disputes\nimpartially. In 239, Himiko\u2019s confederation sent envoys to Daifang commandery, and from\nthere on to the Cao-Wei court in Loyang. Wei, seeking her aid or at least neutrality against\nKogury\u014f in the battles of the next six years, gave her the title \u201cMonarch of Wa, Friendly to Wei.\u201d\nWei supplied Himiko\u2019s court with prestige goods, including bronze mirrors. Wa imitated those\nmirrors, casting many mirrors from the same mold and dispensing them to local chiefs as\nsymbols of authority.\nHimiko was a monarch (a single top ruler), but as yet Yamato had no monarchical\nsystem, because there was no rule of succession. After her death, the chiefs fell to fighting\nagain, so there is no direct line from her leadership to the Yamato court that would oversee the\nnext stage in the centralization process.\nThe area of Nara, Osaka, and Kyoto (the Kinai region), maintained some kind of cultural\nleadership, to judge from tomb styles. What we call the Yamato court gradually centralized\ncontrol in the Kinai under first one local clan and then another, as supply lines of prestige goods\nshifted. For instance, in 313, when the commanderies fell to Kogury\u014f, one group of\npowerholders in Nara lost their access to mainland prestige goods and gave way to a group with\nconnections with Kumgwan Kaya with its superb trading connections. Meanwhile, chiefs outside\nChapter 6, p. 22 129\nof the Kinai kept up their own relations with the peninsula, remaining independent of Yamato for\ntwo centuries after Himiko. They developed their own specialties based on the local ecology and\ntrade connections, so that even as the Yamato gathered strength from about 400, regional polities\njust as large existed, including Kibi, Tsukushi (northern Kyushu), Izumo (on the Sea of Japan\ncoast of western Honshu), Owari (on the pacific coast of central Japan), and Kenu (east of\nTokyo).27\nThe formation of a Japanese state was interrupted and slow, and happened in a variety of\nplaces, under the shifting leadership of different groups who appear clearly in the archaeological\nrecord, but are invisible or barely discernible in written history.\nKing Y\u016bryaku Begins Yamato Centralization\nYamato centralization of Wa began, as always, with warfare, negotiation, and exchanges.\nAn energetic Yamato leader called Wakatakir\u014d, but known in legends as Y\u016bryaku (458-479) and\nin mainland sources as King Wu of Wa, organized the chiefly clans into a rudimentary ranking\nsystem, using hereditary titles based on peninsular nomenclature to define positions in the\nhierarchy. His court was little more than a few thatched wooden buildings huddled together,\nconstantly burning down or rotting, since the support poles sat directly on the ground. (What is\nthe better way? Only after 500 did the Kinai region adopt the rudimentary comfort of the\ncookstove and its home-heating system, and begin to produce rooftiles.)\nFig 6.10 Haniwa earthenware horse\u2019s head, Japan, sixth century. About a foot long. Source: Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art. Public domain.\nChiefs visited Y\u016bryaku to offer greetings and receive in return mirrors from the mainland\nand jade bracelets made only in the Kinai area. Yamato officially \u201cgranted\u201d each chiefly clan the\nChapter 6, p. 23 130\nright to collect resources from the territory it already controlled in reality. (This is similar to the\nway the Southern mainland Liu-Song dynasty (429-479) granted Wa authority over Silla and\nKaya \u2013 neither Liu-Song nor Yamato Wa could enforce that authority; it really just an expressed\nthe wish of the embassy that visited the Liu-Song court.) But when the chiefs accepted gifts,\ntitles, and grants from Yamato, they gave it a nominal leadership role.\nAs well as sweet-talking chiefs into recognizing Yamato preeminence, Y\u016bryaku and his\nsuccessors actively promoted immigration from the peninsula and perhaps further afield. They\nsettled immigrants where their technical skills could be best deployed, under the command of the\nchiefs. First: horses. By around 400, Yamato had begun importing horses, and the experts who\nknew how to raise, breed and handle them, as an excavation near Osaka in about 2008 showed.\n(The full skeleton of a horse buried with honors in the fifth century also has been excavated in\nKyushu.)28 But Yamato wanted more horses than it could raise itself. The Nagano chiefs (to the\nnorthwest of Tokyo) had long been connected to horsemen of the peninsula, as evinced by an\niron sword with a spiral pommel of AD 150 and a horse-shaped bronze buckle of about AD 250.\nSo Nagano chiefs were able to invite peninsular experts in horsemanship to settle there over\ngenerations from about 450-700, judging from peninsular-style tombs containing archipelago-\nstyle clay figures (haniwa) \u2013 along with a sacrificed horse.29 Nagano chiefs could exchange their\nhorse knowledge for signs of authority from Yamato.\nFig. 6.11 Haniwa earthenware figure of a warrior. Japan, sixth c. Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nSecond: iron. Yamato took advantage of the specialization of the Kibi area, along the\nsouthern coast of Honshu west of Hiroshima, facing Shikoku across the Inland Sea. A pit-\ndwelling from the early 400s in Kibi had an earthen stove for cooking and heating, the earliest\nkind of sue pottery, iron arrowheads in Kaya style, iron ingots, even iron slag (the by-product of\niron purification), and whetstones for sharpening iron blades. That means that immigrants from\nChapter 6, p. 24 131\nKaya had settled there, bringing Kaya technology: making iron tools, sue ware, and salt, which\nthe dry climate was good for. A hundred similar pit houses cluster around a keyhole-style tomb\nand some smaller tombs; these would have been for a big chief and some lesser chiefs. The\nchiefs of Kibi had lost a fight against Y\u016bryaku in 463, and in 555, the Soga clan, acting for\nEmperor Kinmei, set up royal estates in their territory. He had the local chiefs supervise more\npeninsular immigrants whom Yamato sent there to begin the earliest iron-smelting in the\narchipelago. (A couple of dozen iron-smelting furnaces and charcoal-making kilns have been\nfound there.) Since immigrants had been making iron tools from imported ingots there for about\n150 years, the Yamato court was building on local knowledge.30\nWar required iron and horses, and now the archipelago had its own supply of both. The\ncleverness of Yamato lay in its positioning itself as the central coordinator. Other chiefs in the\ntime of Y\u016bryaku, even within an area as small as 125 miles in diameter, and even though each\nhad peninsular partners, in one historian\u2019s words \u201cdid not share cultural traits nor form a political\nunity.\u201d31 They left that cultural and political unification process up to Yamato.\nKinai clans struggled to influence the succession to the Yamato throne. Twenty-five\nyears after Y\u016bryaku died, his direct heirs were wiped out by fighting both amongst themselves\nand with other clans.\nSword Inscriptions\nIn the fifth century (401-500), scribes from the peninsula working for Yamato kings\nproduced the first long inscriptions written and preserved in the archipelago. The Eta-Funayama\nsword, about three feet long and decorated with inlaid horses, birds, and fish, was found in 1873\nin a tomb in western Kyushu that was full of gold and silver ornaments and weapons. It has a\n75-character inscription that reads:\nIn the age of the Great King Wa[\u2026]ru who ruled all-under-Heaven, the master of\nceremonies who served him, named Murite, during the eighth month, used a large\niron kettle to alloy a four-foot court sword. Eighty times refined and ninety times\nbeaten, it is a three-inch-wide excellent [sharp] sword. Whoever bears this sword\n[will/may he] live long, have a sea-full of sons and grandsons, obtain [\u2026 the\nking\u2019s?] favor, and not lose that which he governs. The name of the swordsmith\nthe writer is \u5f35\u5b89.\u2021\nis Itawa and\nLurie guesses that the \u201cwriter\u201d \u2013 whether s/he composed the inscription or just did the\ncalligraphy or actually inscribed and inlaid it is not clear \u2013 was probably an immigrant from the\npeninsula, perhaps one who claimed mainland ancestry. The characters giving the writer\u2019s name\nare larger than the others, but that could just be because the blade is broader toward the hilt,\nwhere they are written. Lurie refers to \u201cthe triangular relationship among king, scribe, and\nvassal seen in the fifth-century sword inscriptions\u201d (99).32 The swordsmith joined them.\nThe Sakitama-Inariyama sword blade (Fig. 6.12) was excavated in 1968 near Tokyo. It\nhas 57 characters on the front and 58 on the back. The king mentioned on both swords was\nprobably the \u201csemi-legendary\u201d (Lurie\u2019s term) Y\u016bryaku, who also sent a long document to the\n\u2021 Zhang An (Ch.)/ Chang An (K.)/ Ch\u014d An (J.)\nChapter 6, p. 25 132\nsouthern Liu Song dynasty (420-479)\u2019s court in 478. Because the two swords have the same\nruler\u2019s name, and both adopted the classical phrase \u201call-under-Heaven\u201d (\u5929\u4e0b), most scholars\nthink that they both came from the Yamato court, but one thinks that the Sakitama sword was\nproduced away from the court. (See if you can come up with arguments for both views.)\nFig 6.12 The Sakitama-Inariyama sword blade, about 2\u00bd feet long, showing both sides. Excavated in\n1968 near Tokyo. Source: David B. Lurie, Realms of Literacy, p. 95. Used by permission of the author.\nAs with mirror inscriptions, Lurie argues that these impressive, inscribed objects do not\nmean that society was literate, or even that the court was literate: written words could hold\nChapter 6, p. 26 133\nmeaning \u201calegibly,\u201d without being read. Reading and writing mattered little at the Yamato court\nright up to about 700. Tomb-period rulers had great resources, yet they did not find it\nworthwhile to master reading. Their relations with the peninsula, especially Paekche, meant that\nthey had scribes who knew Chinese when they did want something done with writing.33\nYamato after Y\u016bryaku\nIn the early sixth century, power at the Yamato court shifted to King Keitai, who allied\nwith Paekche King Muryong in 503. Muryong needed Yamato military support, because\nKogury\u014f had forced Paekche to move its capital from Seoul southwards, much closer to Kaya. A\nmirror with the two ruler\u2019s names and the date has been excavated. Tombs, too, signal this ruler-\nto-ruler alliance in three ways.\nFirst, the enormous \u201ckeyhole\u201d tombs that developed gradually in the archipelago for\nrulers from 250 to 600 appear and disappear suddenly in one small part of Paekche: thirteen of\nthem at just this time. Paekche kings had simply allied with local chiefs in the area by giving\nthem gilt-bronze crowns. But Muryong needed closer control now, and archaeologist Woo Jae-\nPyoung hypothesizes that Muryong granted local chiefs the honor of being buried in this kind of\ntomb. It was a special honor in Japan \u2013 reserved for the highest rulers. By granting (and\npresumably paying for) fancy tombs for local chiefs, Muryong could honor them and at the same\ntime remind them that he was allied with a powerful ruler in the archipelago.\nSecond, at the same time, Keitai and the Yamato court adopted Paekche-style tombs.\nThat advertised the alliance to rivals at home, and to Kogury\u014f, which had just wiped out\nK\u016dmgwan Kaya. Third, Muryong had also sent a mission to the Southern Qi dynasty on the\nmainland. Eager for maritime trade, Qi granted him the title \u201cGrand General,\u201d and he\nconstructed for himself a brick-chambered tomb in their style. His coffin was made of elegant\nJapanese umbrella pinewood, and his grave goods included both Yamato-style bronze mirrors\nand celadon pottery from southern China. To all who attended his funeral, or heard about the\ntomb, \u2013 to Kaya, Silla, Kogury\u014f and the local chiefs \u2013 those goods and the Qi-style tomb sent the\nmessage that he had powerful and prestigious allies both to the east and to the west. A century\nlater, when Paekche had achieved political stability, both foreign styles of tomb were dropped.34\nThe Three Kingdoms and Yamato began as confederations of warrior chiefs dominating\nunarmed commoners. Prestige goods, practical goods, horses, and funerary diplomacy all played\ntheir part in strengthening the kingdoms. Slowly, and with repeated interruption of the actual\ndescent line, one clan would gain enough predominance, initially through violence and control of\nprestige goods, to call itself royal. New monarchs worked to further distinguish themselves from\nthe chiefs, organized now into an aristocracy.\nBut objects could only go so far in supporting power \u2013 even if they came from impossibly\nfar away, like the Persian and Roman glass unearthed in fifth-century Japanese tombs.35 More\nvaluable in the long run were new skills. Monarchs and their courts learned from immigrants\nand envoys how to forge and smelt; to read and write; to count, measure, and tax; to calculate\ndescent and claim virtue; to patronize, build, and pray.\nBuddhism in Public Life\nAcross East Asia \u2013 not only in Japan where scholars talk about Shinto \u2013 many gods and\ndemons were quite local. A famous scholar, Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801), explained kami:\nChapter 6, p. 27 134\nSpeaking in general\u2026 kami signifies, in the first place, the deities of heaven and\nearth that appear in the ancient records and also the spirits of the shrines where\nthey are worshipped. It is hardly necessary to say that it includes human beings. It\nalso includes such objects as birds, beasts, trees, plants, seas, mountains, and so\nforth. In ancient usage, anything whatsoever that was outside the ordinary, that\npossessed superior power, or that was awe-inspiring was called kami. Eminence\nhere does not refer merely to the superiority of nobility, goodness, or meritorious\ndeeds. Evil and mysterious things, if they are extraordinary and dreadful, are\ncalled kami. It is needless to say that among the human beings who are called\nkami the successive generations of sacred emperors are all included\u2026 In lesser\ndegree we find, in the present as well as in ancient times, human beings who are\nkami. Although they may not be accepted throughout the whole country, yet in\neach province, each village, and each family there are human beings who are\nkami, each one according to his own proper position\u202636\nLocal spirits like this, including natural forces and former humans, received worship everywhere.\nDaoism incorporated many gods and demons, while elite families also practiced Confucianism.\nBut Buddhism offered centralizing kings new, universal, ways to patronize, build, and pray.\nThe Buddha, an Indian prince named Siddhartha, had lived in the northern subcontinent\nbetween 623 and 383 BC. His teachings (read Kenneth Chen, \u201cBackground\u201d in his Buddhism in\nChina) were written down in Sri Lanka after 100 BC, centuries later and a thousand miles away.\nThe Indian King Ashoka (r. 268-239 BC) was an early sponsor: he inherited an empire and\nfought to expand it, but then regretted the bloodshed, converted to Buddhism, and used his power\nto promulgate the faith, engraving its tenets on pillars of stone in all the languages of his empire.\nThe Kushan Empire (AD 50-250) in Northern India and Central Asia also sponsored Buddhism,\nadding to the Buddhist repertoire of art, architecture, doctrine, and practice.\nMerchants, missionaries, and diplomats brought the faith and its repertoire to East Asia\npiecemeal, by sea and by land, including precious objects, intriguing stories, body practices, and\narchitectural techniques. Buddhism offered powerful assistance in worldly and spiritual matters\nthrough Bodhisattvas: enlightened beings who had vowed not to dissipate in nirvana at death, but\nto remain in the world to help others. Buddhist statues were lifelike, awesome human figures\nbased on Greek sculpture that had been brought to the Kushan area of Gandhara by Alexander\nthe Great. All these factors contributed to the appeal of Buddhism for East Asia.\nThe early stages of the transmission are obscure. The first recorded believer, a Han royal\nprince who received imperial permission to worship the Buddha in AD 65, probably just thought\nof it as a kind of Daoism. Missionary monks formed a small community in the Han caiptial of\nLuoyang, translating and teaching, by about AD 150.37 In their wildest dreams, did they hope for\nthe success Buddhism eventually attained in East Asia? For as it absorbed and changed all kinds\nof spirits and human concerns, it became the most widely shared substrate of life across the\nregion and across social rank.\nAfter the fall of Han, East Asian rulers one after another modelled themselves on King\nAshoka, the \u010dakravartin king who \u201cturned the wheel of the Buddhist law\u201d with his patronage.\nWell-attuned to diplomacy and domination through prestige goods, they appreciated how Ashoka\nhad spread the Buddhist faith while assuring his own good reputation. For only a virtuous king\nChapter 6, p. 28 135\nwould wish, and only a great king could afford, to build vast temples; endow them with large\nestates to feed monks and nuns while they prayed, held masses, translated and copied scriptures,\nlectured to the public, and meditated; carve cave complexes filled with stone statues; and support\nartisans to create beautiful, gilded bronze and wooden images. Often pagodas and festivals\ncentered on precious relics such as the Buddha\u2019s tooth or fingerbone \u2013 a new kind of prestige\ngood for display. Such patronage illustrated royal control over land and labor, and elevated the\nking above the aristocracy in a way that included the entire populace.\nSuch patronage made sense to many East Asian rulers. For instance, Silla monarch\nsponsored and oversaw Buddhist clergy using methods learned from the Northern Wei, Zhou,\nand Qi dynasties. In 551 a refugee monk from Kogury\u014f, Hyeryang, was the first state supervisor\nof Silla\u2019s monks and nuns. Chajang, a Silla aristocrat who returned from Tang in 643 to serve\nunder Queen S\u014fnd\u014fk and her successors, also played this role. Silla also appointed provincial\noverseers of clergy, including some from former Kogury\u014f and Paekche, in around 685, as\ninscriptions on pillars and bells show, and from 785 there was also an office to advise the\nmonarch on managing Buddhist building projects, wealth, land, and personnel.38\nBuddhist international style included rock-cut temples as well as soaring wooden towers\nand huge wooden halls on a scale East Asians had not known how to build before. Northern\nmainland rulers built cave complexes and huge temples in which enormous Buddha figures\nsymbolized the ruler; one northern monk went so far as to say that the Wei ruler was the Buddha.\nDiplomatic missions to mainland courts were taken on tours of the impressive sites, thus\nshowing off to the public that visitors had come from afar to honor the ruler. Paekche\u2019s pagodas\n(Buddhist towers) were particularly admired, the most famous being the Nine-Story Stupa that\nAbiji, a Paekche architect, built for Queen S\u01d2nd\u01d2k of Silla (r. 632-647), to fulfill the advice of a\nmainland dharma dragon who told monk Chajang that it would protect his country. Rulers\nadopted Buddhist display to exalt themselves and other rulers above their subjects.\nIn southern mainland regimes, royal control over Buddhism was far less complete. Both\nrulers and aristocratic clans patronized Buddhism as part of their pursuit, creation, and display of\nbeauty, education, and high culture \u2013 they had beautiful images made for them, studied\ncomplicated Buddhist texts, and wrote out sutras in beautiful calligraphy. Aristocratic monks of\nthe southern dynasties included Huiyuan (334-416), who corresponded with Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, a great\ntranslator of sutras. Huiyuan acquired more scriptures from India, put together a translation\nteam, and built his own temple. He taught that faith in Amitabha Buddha alone, and chanting his\nname, could earn spiritual merit, which opened Buddhist practice to all ranks. Monks and nuns\nfrom aristocratic families north and south lectured to thousands of people: a new, non-official\nform of public influence. Huiyuan even argued that monks and nuns should not bow before\nkings; they followed different rules from ordinary people to signal their higher calling.\nBuddhism offered various models of power and piety, opening up wide new fields of public\ndiscourse.\nChapter 6, p. 29 136\nFig 6.14 Northern Wei stone Buddhist triad with\nflying apsaras, 62\u201d high, dated 534, with\nFig 6.13 Northern Qi or Sui figure of a monk, inscription on the back praising the majesty of\ngilt-bronze, piece-mold cast, sixth century. the Buddha and attendant bodhisattvas carved by\nSource: Metropolitan Museum.

But Bodhidharma, the founder of Chan or Zen Buddhism, told him that all the\nmoney he had spent would move him no closer to enlightenment; only meditation did that,\nChapter 6, p. 30 137\nwhether it worked gradually, as Northern Chan taught, or suddenly, as in Southern Chan, which\nused paradoxes called \u201ccases\u201d (in Japanese ko\u2019an) to stimulate the realization that the whole\nworld (including good deeds) was illusory. (This school became popular later with samurai,\nbecause if one kills while understanding that all is illusion, no sin has been committed and no\nkarma results.)39\nFig 6.15 Kogury\u014f gilt-bronze Budda with inscription on the back of the halo.

Korea Open\nGovernment License permits use, unchanged, regardless of commercial use without fee.\nAs well as sharing an architectural style, East Asian kings gave each other Buddhist texts,\nimages, relics, ritual objects, and monks. In 372, a mainland regime sent icons and texts, and\nmonk S\u014fndo, to Kogury\u014f as a diplomatic gesture (Kogury\u014f preferred Daoism). In 384 Eastern\nJin sent a Central Asian monk, Malanda, to Paekche; King Chimnyu welcomed him by building\na temple and assigning ten men to serve as monks. In 541, Paekche King S\u014fng flattered the\nChapter 6, p. 31 138\nsouthern Liang Emperor Wu by requesting the sutra he had commented on.40 Eleven years later,\nKing S\u014fng sent a mission to Yamato with gifts of Buddhist ritual banners and canopies of silk,\nand a gilt-bronze statue of the Buddha (probably a foot or so high). Impressive buildings\nwordlessly signaled the resources the patron controlled. Objects, including texts (which few\npeople could read initially), worked in the same way as other prestige objects to link monarchs.\nMonks were more even directly useful. Kings trying to increase their power vis-\u00e0-vis\nthat of other aristocrats needed advisors. Monks from abroad had no kin to distort their loyalty\nto the ruler. Highly-educated and widely-travelled, they understood politics and often spoke\nseveral languages and knew the Classics, histories, literature, and so on. They modelled the\nritualized polite behavior so central to court life, showing new kings and aristocrats how to\nbehave. Their practice of prayer, chant, and meditation brought them an apparent calm, and\nsince they were not supposed to crave riches, it was difficult to bribe them. And because of the\nhigh level of organization required for unrelated men or women to live together in large\nmonasteries and nunneries, Buddhism had a tradition of creating systems that ran by rules and\nregulations. Organization by rules is precisely what a centralizing regime needs.\nFor all these reasons, monks advised kings across East Asia even before most people\npracticed Buddhism. In Kogury\u014f and Paekche, monks from the Vinaya (Rules) school of\nBuddhism were playing this role by 500. Precisely because monks made good advisors, they\nwere a meaningful gift from one ruler to another: a way to help an ally to centralize his power,\nincreasing his ability to tax and field armies. The dates for official acceptance of Buddhism\n(Kogury\u014f in 372, Paekche in 384, Silla two centuries later in 535) signal those regimes\u2019\nopenness to learning from mainland traditions generally, rather than total conversion to the faith.\nBut royal faith was often genuine. Paekche King S\u014fng\u2019s son wanted to become a monk.\nCourtiers convinced him to take the throne as Widok. He spread the faith through diplomacy\nwith the Yamato court, sending missions between 555 and 577 that included two monks and a\nnun, a number of Buddhist texts, and two artisans who specialized in making Buddhist ritual\nitems. King Widok welcomed nuns from Yamato to study in Paekche, and he sent a mission to\nNorthern China, to the Northern Qi (550-577), most Buddhist of the northern regimes. Buddhism\nworked as a diplomatic language through both display and shared faith, strengthening kings.\nBuddhism changed daily life for every single person in East Asia. Along with the new\nfaith, which revolutionized conceptions of the cosmos, came Indian mathematics including the\nzero; new knowledge in astronomy, astrology, divination, and medicine; business practices such\nas loans on security, joint-stock associations to pool capital, auctions, and lotteries; chairs; tea,\nsugar, and the industrial processes required to make sugar (Tang Taizong sent a delegation to\nIndia specifically to learn how). The need to translate Buddhist scriptures into Classical Chinese\nfor East Asian audiences contributed to scholarship on linguistics. The most characteristic form\nof Tang poetry, with four or eight lines of five or seven syllables apiece, developed out of a\nSanskrit ode of praise. Buddhist tales chanted and sung by monks and laypeople developed into\nboth long fiction and drama, which had not existed in the great tradition before.\nBuddhism offered both men and women a way to live outside the family, as monks and\nnuns; the rules that were developed to manage large communities of unrelated people were later\nadopted by Confucian academies. Buddhist charity and proselytization gave even ordinary men\nand women a role in public life, as donors and lay leaders.41 At the same time, however, the idea\nChapter 6, p. 32 139\nthat past deeds earned present status legitimated the firmly aristocratic mentality of the next\nseveral centuries. Finally since creating wealth and making donations to monasteries earned\ndonors good karma, Buddhism forward commercialization and exploitation of nature.42\nEast Asians did change Buddhism in significant ways. The fear of eating a reincarnated\nancestor, for instance, led to the introduction of vegetarianism, which Buddha had not preached.\nBut over time, East Asian culture, knowledge, society, language, literature, economy, and daily\nlife were all revolutionized by this imported religion.\n1 Beginning in the tenth century, historians used the term \u201cWei-Jin and Northern and Southern Dynasties\u201d\nto mean the years 220 to 589. Within that, \u201cThe Three Kingdoms\u201d (Cao-Wei, Shu Han, and Wu) means\n220-280. \u201cJin\u201d means 265-420. \u201cSix Dynasties\u201d may refer to southern regimes, 222 to 589, or a different\nset of northern regimes (Wilkinson, Chinese History: A New Manual, 728-29). When extended to the\nfurther reaches of today\u2019s China, the dynastic convention is even more misleading. Jacob Whittaker\nproposed the following more accurate chronology for Yunnan before about 1400, as an example:\nDian Kingdom 279-109 BCE\nHan Empire (colony) 109 BCE-ca. 231 CE\nCuan Family (often as vassals to the successive states ruling the Sichuan basin) ca. 231-602 CE\nSui Empire (colony) 602-619\nTang Empire (colony) 619-737\nNanzhao Kingdom 737-902\nDachanghe Kingdom 902-928\nDatianxing Kingdom 928-937\nDali Kingdom 937-1254\nMongol colony /Yuan province 1254-1381(Facebook, Sinologists group, January 21, 2021).\n2 Chen, Multicultural China in the Early Middle Ages.\n3 Wang Zhenping, Tang China in Multi-polar Asia: A History of Diplomacy and War, p. 5.\n4 The warfare and maneuverings among these Three Kingdoms gave rise to a colorful novel very loosely\nbased in historical fact, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and to a major cult in late imperial popular\nreligion, that to Lord Guan.

Both fought Kogury\u014f (37-668), and Tang allied with Silla (c. 500 \u2013 935; united in\n668). Silla, both to solidify the alliance and to centralize control over resources it needed for war,\ntook on much of the apparatus of Tang civilization and government, both the Sinitic tradition and\nBuddhism. But its monarchs remained weaker, its aristocrats stronger, and its slaves more\nnumerous than in the second mainland empire. The menace of the Tang-Silla alliance also\npushed forward centralization in the archipelago, presided over by leaders designated \u201cYamato.\u201d\nThe result was that despite continuing social and cultural differences, regimes in East Asia\nlooked more similar than ever.\nWritten Chinese and Government\nEast Asians spoke not three, but many languages. The Sino-Tibetan language family,\nwhich may have spread with millet-growing from somewhere between Xinjiang and Sichuan\nfrom 8,000 BC included, in the period of division, Tibetan, ten Chinese languages (sometimes\ncalled dialects), Tangut and related languages, and hundreds of other languages we know little\nabout. Mandarin had not yet developed, and scholars are not sure whether the Middle Chinese\nspoken at the Sui-Tang court of Chang\u2019an (along with other languages) was Chang\u2019an dialect or\na conglomeration of various dialects like modern Shanghainese. A Sichuanese monk named\nZhixuan (809-881) had so much trouble communicating in the capital that he avoided\ndiscussions until one night, in his dreams, a divine monk switched tongues with him. The next\nday, he was able to speak correctly \u2013 that is in the capital dialect.1 In the steppe, people spoke\nmany Mongolian and Turkic languages; in the southern mainland people spoke languages in the\nThai, Hmong-Miao, Yao, and Austronesian language family. Some languages had fused Sino-\nTibetan with earlier local languages: Cantonese, for instance, is a Sino-Tibetan language with a\nThai tonal system and lots of Thai vocabulary. The peninsula and archipelago also had multiple\nlanguages. Present-day Korean is related to the Tungus languages of Manchuria and Siberia.2\nJapanese may have evolved from a language of Kaya, with a lot of influence from the Ainu and\nMalayo-Polynesian languages already being spoken in the islands.3 (See Map N.)\nLinguistic borrowings were common. Korean and Japanese borrowed Chinese words;\nand Chinese borrowed Turkic words. The area around Canton and along the southern Fujian\ncoast may have contributed to Chinese words from Australia and Polynesia, including the name\nfor the Yangzi River (jiang \u6c5f). Some travelers learned many languages. The children of inter-\ncultural marriages, or elite children whose nannies spoke local languages, were bilingual.\nRulers valued language skills. Yamato Emperor Bidatsu was very pleased in 583 when Kibi no\nAma no Atai Hashima negotiated with the king of Paekche in his own language, and brought a\nPaekche man back to the Yamato court. Language could be a focus of fights within regimes.\nUnder Empress Dowager Feng (442 - 490), for instance, the Tuoba Wei dynasty adopted Chinese\nsurnames and required that Chinese be spoken at court. A few decades later, in reaction, Xianbei\nnames were required; some whose surnames had originally been Chinese now took Xianbei ones,\nand learned to speak Xianbei to serve at court.\nChapter 7, p. 1\n\"An Outline History of East Asia to 1200, third edition\" by Sarah Schneewind is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.\nRetrieved from https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9d699767 142\nMap N: About language. Places mentioned in the text.\nIn this multi-lingual world, the tiny but powerful stratum of educated people across East\nAsia adopted the whole Chinese-language written tradition \u2013 the Classics, the philosophers, the\nhistories, literature, the texts of Confucianism and Daoism, and Buddhist texts translated into\nwhat we call Classical Chinese, which has a grammar different from today\u2019s spoken versions of\nChinese. Reading the Book of Documents and the Shiji, Koreans came to see themselves as the\nheirs of Prince Ji (Kija) (remember him, back in Chapter Two?). Silla aristocrats scolded their\nkings in the language of Mencius. Paekche immigrants brought Chinese poetry to the\nChapter 7, p. 2 143\narchipelago, and Yamato noblemen wrote reams of poetry in Classical Chinese, alongside poems\nin Japanese that initially used Chinese characters to represent sounds.\nClassical Chinese was the written language of government, too. King Kwanggaet\u2019o\u2019s\nstele is in Classical Chinese, and so are the excavated records and registers on wooden tablets\nand bamboo slips that attest to the spread of bureaucratic government. Prince Sh\u014dtoku\u2019s \u201c17-\nArticle Constitution\u201d and the laws of Nara, as well as all the East Asian histories, use Classical\nChinese. Educated people across East Asia were bilingual, at least.\nThe Second Empire in the Mainland\nIn 581, a general of a Xianbei dynasty, Yang Jian (in Xianbei \u201cPuliuru Jian\u201d) launched a\ncoup d\u2019etat. He conquered the Jiankang empire and reunited much of the former Han territory.\nNaming his new empire Sui, he decided to signal its permanence by demolishing the sad old\nremains of Han Chang\u2019an and building an entirely new capital. There were practical\nconsiderations \u2013 moving to newer ground made newer sources of water available. But in\naddition, the old Han capital had suffered four centuries of warfare, disease, massacre, murders,\nand executions, so one advisor warned Yang Jian that old Chang\u2019an was filled with the ghosts of\nmurdered men. It would be best to start over. Newer, better-designed cities such as the Wei\ncapital of Luoyang, which Queen Himiko\u2019s envoys had visited, provided models. The main\narchitect of the new Chang\u2019an was a Turko-Mongol, a member of the Yuwen family whom Yang\nJian had spared in his coup. Yuwen was a brilliant architect and engineer, and his team included\nnortherners and Central Asians of various language and religious groups. One had a Zoroastrian\nname. The Sui was a multi-ethnic enterprise from the start.\nNot only multi-ethnic, Sui tried to draw in people of all ranks \u2013 but without returning to\nthe egalitarian aims of Legalism, nor to the equal treatment under the law of Qin-Han times. In\nchoosing a good site for the new capital, Yang Jian made a tortoise-shell divination, and\nconsulted astronomers and astrologers. But he also appealed to the public, writing, \u201cThe new\ncapital is the administrative seat of the ten thousand officials and the place to which all those\nwithin the four seas will turn. It is not the sole possession of Us the Emperor.\u201d He asked the\npeople to take on the burden of the work, saying,\nPlanning the new and getting rid of the old is like the farmer looking forward to\nautumn. Although for the time the work may be hard, he knows that at the end he\nwill be peacefully at ease.\nImagine the work involved in building an entirely new city, surrounded by a pounded earth wall\nthat was almost 6 miles east to west and over 5 miles north to south, and maybe 35 feet high.\nThe labor force was made up of farmers who owed the state thirty days of labor. There were also\nspecialized artisans who made rooftiles and other items. The basic layout of the city was\ncompleted in nine months; then people had to move in and build their houses. The new emperor\nencouraged them also to build temples and pagodas. In Tang times, this grand vision of a city\nwas realized, and Chang\u2019an became the greatest city in the world at the time. Its Buddhist\nfestivals indeed included all ranks of people, including the commoners who built it.\nSui soon added a second capital at Luoyang. Following the Qin-Han first empire\u2019s\nplaybook, Sui also built infrastructure to overcome the natural ecological divisions of the empire.\nAlong with more roads, Sui linked Yangzi and Yellow Rivers with the Grand Canal system,\nChapter 7, p. 3 144\nwhich combined canals and rivers. The main canal was more than 130 feet wide; an imperial ran\nroad alongside it, punctuated by relay stations. The Canal system\u2019s first task was to carry\ngovernment communication, but as the Yangzi valley area produced more and more rice, it also\ncarried tax grain to the capital to feed the imperial family, government officials and staff, and\nhungry urbanites of Sui and Tang. A second canal ran from Luoyang up to present day-Beijing.\nSui\u2019s outreach out to that area far from the capital, in the old state of Yan, was a strategic choice\nthat signaled \u2013 ominously for the Sui, as it turned out \u2013 broader territorial ambitions.4\nTo assure that the state served the public, not merely the elite, and to create a long-lived\nregime, Sui revised recruitment and reinstated elements of legalist bureaucracy. First, in terms of\nrecruitment: The elite of the Sino-Steppe empire out of which Sui and Tang grew had become\naccustomed to simply inheriting government office, or at most being selected on the basis of\ntheir grand family histories with their military accomplishments. After the fall of Han,\nbureaucrats had neither been controlled by the center as in the original Legalist vision, nor\nselected for individual learning and virtue as the Confucian compromise with legalism advocated.\nFor instance, two men were competing for a government office in a northern regime in\nthe 500s. One said: \u201cFor successive generations my family have been the governors of this\nprefecture. Your family for generations have been the old servants of my house.\u201d\nThe other retorted, \u201cFrom the time your ancestor Bi Gui was executed (300 years earlier)\nyour family has been inactive and has produced no notable persons. Recently the governorship\nof this prefecture has been awarded on the basis of military feats. Then and now, what do you\nhave to boast about? How can you match our Han dynasty Metropolitan Prefect, our Jin dynasty\nGrand Preceptor of the Heir Apparent, our scholarly and moral achievements spreading\nexcellence for a hundred generations?\u201d\nThe two agreed that office should be granted on the basis of family accomplishments, and\nthat bureaucratic service essentially ought to serve those families\u2019 interests, rather than the other\nway around. Now, to recruit new talent and promote ideals of public service, the Sui wiped out\nthe old rank systems and returned to a Han-like system of recommendation by local officials,\nfollowed by an examination at the capital.\nSecond, in terms of government structure: the legacy of the aristocracy that had grown up\nin both north and south meant that the emperor was not impossibly far above all others as in the\npure Legalist model. Rather, he was \u201cfirst among equals.\u201d That meant that in making decisions\nhe consulted with ministers, who were drawn from among his relatives, his in-laws, and\nmembers of other elite families. The group sat down together and talked until they came to a\nconsensus (with, of course, all kinds of lobbying and machinating going on behind the scenes).\nBut the Han emperors, except for perhaps Wudi, had not been as powerful as in the Legalist\nmodel, either, and in Sui and Tang the central government did recover its power, compared with\nmost of the regimes since late Han.\nSpecifically, the center again registered and taxed most commoners, and selected all\nthose bureaucrats who administered the prefectures of the empire. Those officials (prefects)\nserved for short terms, and not in their native places, as under Qin and Han. Every prefecture\nhad to send one official to the capital at the New Year, to see the glory of the emperor and\nparticipate in rituals there, increasing the sense that all belonged to one empire. The central\nChapter 7, p. 4 145\ngovernment included many different bureaux of government, including the functional six\nministries (Rites, Personnel, Revenue, Justice, War, and Public Works) that continued until 1911.\nFollowing through on the very old (Hundred Schools) ideal that loyal officials kept government\nhealthy by pointing out errors and corruption, the Ministry of Investigation or Censorate was so\nactive in remonstrating with the emperor and impeaching officials who were not following\nregulations that Yang Jian had to ask them to chill out during the banquet part of the New Years\u2019\ncelebrations, and let officials relax for a few hours. The system was designed to make the state a\npublic structure again, to assure a long-lasting peace.\nThe Sui-Tang second empire\u2019s model of renewed, revised bureaucracy became the basic\nmodel for all subsequent mainland governments, and was also exported to the peninsula and the\narchipelago. The governing elites of elsewhere and later made changes, and even subverted\nagain the public-minded intent of the model; but they continued to build on it as the latest\naddition to the Sinitic tradition of governing, just as they incorporated and added to the rich\nliterature of Tang as a continuation of the Sinitic literary tradition.\nReunification through Pluralism: Sui and Tang\nBuddhism\nMerely reinstituting a centralized government, however, could not overcome the deep\ncultural and identity divisions of the post-Han mainland. To knit the empire back together, Sui\nand Tang did cultural work starting at the family level. The Sui imperial couple married their\nchildren into southern aristocratic families, and encouraged other northern aristocrats to adopt\nChinese-language surnames and marry across regional and linguistic lines. But that was only the\nfirst step. Both Sui and Tang \u2013 which replaced Sui with another coup d\u2019etat in 618 \u2013 solidified\nmilitary conquest by incorporating as many existing cultural elements as possible into a new,\npluralist empire.\nThe founding Sui imperial couple were both devout Buddhists. They personally copied\nout sutras, and they kept a strict Buddhist lifestyle in the palace, filling it with prayer and incense.\nSince so many of their new subjects, north and south, shared their faith, they used it as one strand\nto weave their new, expanding realm together. In 589, when he defeated the Chen emperor in\nJiankang, Sui Wendi also took boddhisattva vows with Zhiyi (538-597), the founder of a school\nof Buddhism called Tiantai. Tiantai itself drew together northern piety and meditation with\nsouthern sutra study and meditation, presenting a sutra popular in the North as the Buddha\u2019s first\nsermon and one popular in the South as his last.5 Consciously imitating King Ashoka, Sui\nWendi paid to build temples and support monks and nuns across the country. He ordered\nBuddhist clergy to chant Buddhist prayers for the nation three months out of the year. Monks\nalso served at the sacred mountains.\nThe Sui capital alone housed 120 Buddhist temples. The largest supervised the national\nnetwork, set standards of education and behavior for the clergy, and translated Buddhist texts. In\n601, when the Sui founder turned 60, he ordered stupas built in every prefecture, and send monks\nand nuns to bring Buddhist relics to each and celebrate the opening of the stupas. He closed\ngovernment offices for a week\u2019s holiday.\nTang rulers initially lacked such political enthusiasm for Buddhism. The great travelling\nmonk Xuanzang had to sneak out of Tang territory to begin his seventeen-year journey to India\nChapter 7, p. 5 146\nin search of sutras. But when he returned, Tang Taizong welcomed him back, sponsoring the\ntranslation of the 1,300 scrolls he had acquired. After that, imperial support for Buddhism\nfaltered only for about a year, when the government, alarmed at the wealth of monasteries,\nsuppressed Buddhism in 845-46, melting down bells and statues to mint copper coins. Most\nTang rulers lavished resources on temples and monasteries, and in return, monks served the state.\nThey chanted sutras summoning spirit armies to protect the state, drew subjects into one\ncohesive body by presiding over vegetarian feasts for tens of thousands of people, held funerals\nto settle the spirits of soldiers killed in Tang\u2019s massive military campaigns, and watched on\nMount Wutai for auspicious signs of the presence of the bodhisattva Manjusri, which signaled\ngood luck for the dynasty.6 Just as Confucians had allied themselves with the first empire, so\nBuddhists allied with the second.\nConfucianism\nSui and Tang also patronized northern- and southern-style learning to pull the empire\ntogether. The Sui regime hired classicist northerners to claim the Mandate of Heaven. The\npropaganda, modeled on Cao-Wei proclamations, said that the Sui founder had faithfully served\nthe Northern Zhou\u2019s last child emperor until the emperor abdicated in his favor, giving him nine\nritual gifts identical to Cao Cao\u2019s, and pointing to cosmic signs that the dynasty ought to\nchange.7 The Confucian propagandists designed rituals such as informing Heaven of the change,\nissuing a general amnesty, and having the emperor plow a furrow in a special field. The Sui\nissued a detailed code of proper rituals for relations between the emperor and his ministers,\nrelations with foreigners, seasonal sacrifices, and marriage and funeral ceremonies for emperor\nand high officials.\nAs well as public relations for the imperial family as a whole, there were individual\nefforts. Tang Taizong associated himself with culture heroes sage-king Yu, King Wen of Zhou,\nhis brother the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius. He patronized shrines to these figures and wrote\npoems expressing his feelings about them as exemplars. We\u2019ll meet another great self-promoter\nat the end of this chapter.\nIn the period of division, aristocratic families north and south had practiced Confucian\nfamily rituals and intensified attention to the patriline, building on Latter Han ideas and practices\nthat had launched the big clans into the status of a new aristocracy. Here\u2019s an example of\nintensified patrilinealism: In Han times, even royal lines that produced no sons simply died out\n(that was what ended most of the early Han feudal kingdoms), not to speak of other families.\nBut the Western Jin emperor carefully adopted sons as ritual heirs for his brothers who died\nchildless. The Liu-Song dynasty of the South (420 to 479) also built the first state temple\nhonoring Confucius, and Tuoba Empress Dowager Feng had followed suit, as well as having the\nClassic of Filial Piety translated into Xianbei.\nSui and Tang reinforced this shared elite patrilinealism to meld the empire together. Sui\nand Tang set up schools in the capital for elite sons that combined northern classicism with the\nsouthern poetic heritage. And to signal the court\u2019s central cultural role, Sui Wendi collected,\nedited, and copied texts, offering a roll of silk for each scroll of text people brought in. He also\nproscribed \u201csubversive\u201d books, and tried to establish a simple and straightforward literary style.\nTang emperors even decreed that every household own and study the Classic of Filial Piety \u2013 an\norder surely not followed, and perhaps modelled on the promulgation of Buddhist scriptures.\nChapter 7, p. 6 147\nDaoism\nDaoism, too, aided unification. It bridged the gap between commoners and high-ranking\nfamilies better than Confucianism. On the one hand, southern aristocrats had adopted Daoism as\nlegitimating a life of leisure and poetry, as exemplified by Tao Qian and the Seven Sages of the\nBamboo Grove. The southern Liang dynasty had supported a school of Daoism centered on Mt.\nMao near Nanjing, and two of the Northern regimes had adopted Daoism as the state religion.\nOn the other hand, lower-ranking people adhered to the organized Daoism church that grew out\nof the late Han sects.\nSo the Sui regime employed Daoists to make calendars, and drew on their interpretations\nof omens and portents. Sui Wendi repaired Laozi\u2019s shrine and praised himself in an inscription\nthere. He collected over 8,000 scrolls of Daoist texts. Tang sponsored Daoism even more\nenthusiastically: a mission to Kogury\u014f promoted Daoism as an international religion, visiting\nTurkish envoys toured a Daoist temple, and the Dao de jing was translated into Sanskrit, the\nlanguage of Indian Buddhist scriptures.\nThe Tang royal family claimed descent from Laozi (according to Chen Sanping, as part\nof Taizong\u2019s suppression of discussion of their Turkic roots). Empress Wu and her husband\nGaozong both engaged with Daoism. Their grandson, Emperor Xuanzong (r.713-756), invited\nDaoist as well as Buddhist clergy to court, wrote a commentary on the Dao De Jing, and\ninstituted an examination on Daoist scripture, with a school to teach it.\nAnd Other Faiths\nSome people identified with one of the three main teachings \u2013 Buddhism, Daoism, or\nConfucianism \u2013 and clearly perceived and insisted on the differences among them. But for most\npeople, the three coexisted in their lives. They turned to them for different spiritual and social\nneeds. At the same time, what we might as well call mainland Shinto \u2013 cults of the numerous\nlocal gods and demons of each place to whom people turned for help with weather and illness \u2013\nalso continued.\nTang official Di Renjie, an advisor to Empress Wu, won later fame for suppressing (or\ntrying to suppress) a large number of local cults, but he was unusual; generally, the state\ntolerated local deity cults. Buddhist and Daoist clergy, too, tried to stamp out or absorb such\nlocal deities, converting blood sacrifice to vegetarian sacrifice, and enrolling local spirits as\nmembers of the Daoist pantheon, officials in hell, or fierce protectors of temples. But even as\nsome old cults died out, others arose.\nThe state also permitted the many foreigners living in Tang \u2013 perhaps one-third of the\npopulation of the capital alone \u2013 to practice their own faiths, including Judaism, Islam,\nZoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and Christianity. A Syrian branch of Christianity (Nestorians)\neven performed masses in the Tang palace. Overall, the faiths, languages, and peoples unified\nunder one state formed a collage of variety: not uniform across space. As one historian writes,\n\u201cthe Tang empire was not a single homogenous community but rather a hodge-podge of\ncommunities and networks that stretched horizontally and vertically.\u201d8\nChapter 7, p. 7 148\nFig. 7.1.

The P-shaped scabbard mount (in the middle)\nwas probably modelled on Persian longswords, and in turn was the prototype for the Japanese tachi.\nSource: Metropolitan Museum of Art. Public Domain.\nThe War Against Kogury\u014f\nSui\u2019s reconquest of Han territory did not include its far western holdings. The Sui\nfounder worried about the Turks to the West, and about the possibility of Kogury\u014f allying with\nthe Turks \u2013 just as Han Wudi had worried about Chos\u014fn and the Xiongnu. Kogury\u014f did attack\nSui, and Sui\u2019s counterattacks were foiled three times by Kogury\u014f official \u01d3lchi Mundok. The\nwar decimated the Sui army, bankrupted the Sui regime, and destroyed its popular support in its\nnorthern base. When the second Sui emperor was assassinated, Sui general Li Yuan eliminated\nhis rivals through war, to found the Tang dynasty in 618. (His generals included his daughter, the\nPingyang princess, leading an army she herself had raised.) In effect, Kogury\u014f had ended the\nSui dynasty.\nTang quickly incorporated the far west of former Han territory. But to the east things\nwere more complicated. In the middle of the sixth century, the Korean Three Kingdoms were\nstruggling with one another. Silla, with military aid from Yamato in the archipelago, had taken\nconsiderable territory from Kogury\u014f and Paekche. Paekche in its turn allied with Yamato to\nstrike back at Silla. Now, in the seventh century, Silla appealed for aid to Kogury\u014f and Yamato\nin vain, and finally turned to Tang. To signify eagerness for Tang aid, Silla Queen S\u014fndok (r.\n632-647) adopted Tang-style court dress, official titles, and reign-names for its calendars.\nBeginning in 640, she sent members of the Silla royal family to join the thousands of students\nfrom Paekche, Kogury\u014f, Tibet, Turfan, and elsewhere who had flocked to the Tang academy set\nup in 631. The Tang welcomed such prestige-giving moves, for it was not yet secure. The\ndiplomacy also included passing a Silla monk, Chajang (590\u2013658), back and forth with\nscriptures, relics, and images.\nWith Silla and Tang allied, Kogury\u014f aristocrats saw trouble coming. They allowed one\nof their number to seize and centralize power, to prepare a defense.\nConfidently, Tang Taizong (r. 626-649) proclaimed his right and duty to rule the whole\nworld. He personally led troops against Kogury\u014f in 645, behaving with great brutality: he buried\nalive three thousand Malgal (Mohe) warriors fighting for Kogury\u014f. Taizong expected to march\nthe royal family of Kogury\u014f triumphantly across the northeast and through the streets of\nChang\u2019an. Instead, he lost badly; even forts initially he captured were retaken by Kogury\u014f. The\nChapter 7, p. 8 149\ndefeat was so humiliating that historian Andrew Eisenberg calls him \u201can emperor on the run\u201d as\nhe tried to reclaim his reputation and hold onto power. Some courtiers accused him of having a\n\u201cHan Wudi complex\u201d \u2013 as in, \u201cMy empire has to be bigger than his!\u201d\nMap P: Tang and its neighbors.\n\u201cHemorrhaging prestige and political capital,\u201d in Eisenberg\u2019s words, Taizong retreated\nfor a month to Bingzhou, the old home of the Li family. While there he wrote a stone inscription\nfor a famous old shrine to spirits including a very ancient female water deity and a Zhou king.\nThe inscription recounts the history of the dynasty so far (as Changsu\u2019s stele for his father\nChapter 7, p. 9 150\nKwanggaet\u2019o had done in 414), emphasizing that \u2013 unlike Sui \u2013 Tang did not covet wealth and\npower and territory for its own sake, but wanted to rule for the sake of the people. In other\nwords, \u201cOh well, I didn\u2019t really want Kogury\u014f\u2019s territory anyway.\u201d9 \u2013 Fortunately for Taizong,\nTang armies won some great victories to the West, and he was able to retrieve his military\nreputation at gathering of many western tribal leaders who acknowledged his overlordship as\n\u201cHeavenly Khaghan.\u201d 10 Taizong left famous instructions to his sons, saying that military\noffensives should be balanced with the good of the people: this is a position that Kogury\u014f forced\nhim into.\nFigs. 7.2 and 7.3.

Public Domain.\nFifteen years later, in 660, Tang had a bit more success to the east. Tang Gaozong and\nhis Empress Wu allied with Silla King Taejong Muy\u014fl and his successor. Together the two\narmies demolished the kingdom of Paekche; the first mainland military victory in Korea since\nChapter 7, p. 10 151\nHan times. Silla incorporated Paekche\u2019s territory in 660. The Silla-Tang alliance finally\nmanaged to take advantage of internal fighting in Kogury\u014f to defeat it in 668.\nThat done, Tang renounced its ally. It turned on Silla, trying to conquer the whole\npeninsula and Manchuria. But by 676, Silla armies that included the soldiers of its former rival\nkingdoms Paekche and Kogury\u014f had expelled Tang from the whole peninsula, for good. Tang\nand Silla two resumed diplomatic relations. Silla sent frequent embassies to Chang\u2019an, students\nand monks studied there, and a lively trade brought Tang luxury goods to the Silla court. But\nTang and later mainland regimes never got even a toehold on the peninsula again.\nKogury\u014f King Kwanggaet\u2019o, back in the late fourth century, had not fulfilled all of his\nmilitary ambitions. But his kingdom shaped East Asian politics right up until it fell in 668, and\nplayed a definitive role in keeping the very powerful second empire out of the peninsula. Ulchi\nMondok brought down the Sui; defeats by Kogury\u014f destabilized the early Tang; and Kogury\u014f\nsoldiers under Silla chased Tang out of the peninsula. Tang did hold the Manchurian part of\nKogury\u014f\u2019s territory, but only for three decades. Then old Kogury\u014f aristocrats and members of\nthe Malgal (Mohe) tribe rebelled against Tang. They founded the state of Parhae, which lasted in\nManchuria and the Liaodong peninsula until 926. In a way, Kwanggaet\u2019o\u2019s dynasty lived on.\nYamato Centralization\nTaming the Clans\nAnother legacy of the Kogury\u014f wars was the unification of the much of the archipelago\nunder a centralized government. In Chapter Six we saw how Y\u016bryaku and his Yamato court had\nbegun with symbolic visits, titles, and gifts to win recognition as the top, or center, of a network\nof chiefs of clans and regions. Centralization might have gone no further. As archaeologist\nHabuta Yoshiyuki writes, \u201cBecause a political system armed with a well-defined territorial\nboundary and centralized authority is a rare thing in human history, we scholars must be\nconscientious about avoiding assumptions based on the influence of present-day political\nsystems.\u201d11 That the islands would become one nation was not foreordained, nor was that\nsomething that the chiefs and clans even envisioned.\nBy about 600, the Yamato court almost monopolized the prestige goods coming in from\nSilla and Paekche. The court, recall, coordinated the production of horses and iron in regions\nwell-suited to those ventures. Each statelet or clan sent tribute and family members to serve the\nYamato court in specialized ways. The Mononobe had military responsibilities, the\nNakatomi/Fujiwara specialized in Shinto ritual. The Kibi no Ama no Atai family may have been\nput in charge of diplomatic relations with the peninsular kingdoms, because of their long-term\nconnections there. Yamato had figured out how to draw each specialized clan into its service.\nBut each chief still ruled his own statelet. Even after accepting titles and court roles from\nYamato, each chiefly clan maintained its own kami (totem, deity, or spirit) and traditions. Each\nclan had an oral tradition about whichever kami was its ancestor or sponsor \u2013 for not all claimed\nto be descended from their kami. Each clan head kept up sacrifices to that deity, out of faith and\nas a claim to nobility and political authority. Some clans adopted the new gods of Buddhism.\nThe Hata immigrant family of Kibi, for instance, built a Buddhist temple there in about 625\nusing Paekche-style rooftiles. As a method of centralizing power and authority held by these\nindependent clans, prestige goods and violence could do only so much.\nChapter 7, p. 11 152\nFig. 7.4.

Public Domain.\nTo increase its own power and authority, Yamato imported ideas and organization from\nthe mainland, including Buddhism, Confucianism, and ways to govern. Silla and especially\nPaekche provided them. The major players at the Yamato court in the late sixth and early\nseventh centuries were the Soga clan, possibly immigrants from the peninsula (scholars do not\nagree). The Soga dominated the Yamato line matrilineally: marrying and thus giving birth to\nYamato kings. They relied on Buddhism, and their sponsorship of the new religion played a role\nin their competition with the other clans. The most important Soga figures are empress Suiko (r.\n592-628) and her nephew Prince Sh\u014dtoku (574-622). The document known as \u201cPrince\nSh\u014dtoku\u2019s 17-Article Constitution\u201d introduced Buddhist and Confucian ideas in order to\ndifferentiate the Yamato line from all other clans, elevating the king.\nWhy would the clans accept that? The basic reason was fear.\nIn 598, as Sui sent troops against Kogury\u014f, Wa (probably the Yamato court) sent envoys\nto Sui, hoping to avoid attack. More missions went to Tang, with the same aim. But the matter\ngained urgency again only in 645, when Tang Taizong and his ally, Silla\u2019s Queen S\u014fnd\u014fk, hurled\ntheir forces against Kogury\u014f. At that point, Yamato Prince Naka no \u014ce and a clan chief\nNakatomi no Kamatari (615-669, later granted the surname Fujiwara) ousted the Soga clan.\nNakatomi, who had supposedly befriended the prince by coming to his aid during a soccer game,\ndominated the court as head of the anti-Buddhist Shinto ritual experts. He could see trouble\ncoming from Tang, and despite disliking Buddhism \u2013 some thought that the old gods were angry\nChapter 7, p. 12 153\nabout the Buddhist images and were causing widespread illness \u2013 he relied on Paekche\nimmigrants to import bureaucratic methods of government. Along with the changes Prince\nSh\u014dtoku\u2019s \u201cconstitution\u201d had envisaged, the Taika reforms of 646 also laid out a Legalist\nstructure modelled on Tang: a bureaucratic division of court administration; the division of\nterritory into \u201cprovinces\u201d (kuni \u56fd) and \u201cdistricts\u201d (\u90e1); and the registration of all residents as\ntaxpayers. The point was to increase the prestige of the Yamato clan and the control of the\ngovernment over land and labor. The other clans signed on out of fear of the Tang-Silla alliance.\nBut Tang Taizong lost. Pressure let up. The Taika reforms did not really go into effect\nuntil two decades later, when in 663, as allies of Paekche, Wa forces experienced a huge defeat\nby Tang and Silla. They lost four hundred boats and ten thousand men \u2013 probably just meaning\n\u201can awful lot.\u201d The military defeat finally convinced the recalcitrant clans to accept a centralized\nadministration under Yamato that could arm and feed enough soldiers to fend off attack. The\narrival of large numbers of literate refugees from the peninsula, as well as Tang prisoners, not\nonly made the danger quite clear, but also made available the personnel, familiar with Sinitic\ntradition, to design and implement various administrative measures.\nFig. 7.5.

Public domain.\nChapter 7, p. 13 154\nNakatomi/Fujiwara\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Naka no \u014ce, now ruling as Tenji (r. 661-672), oversaw the\nfirst systematic registration of households for tax collection and military duty, a survey of\nfarmland and division into standard-sized fields, a legal code regulating family property and\nother matters, \u2013 and the earliest firmly dateable poems in the Manyoshu, written in Old Japanese\nusing Chinese characters. Tens of thousands of excavated wooden tablets show that bureaucratic\ncontrol \u2013 counting, taxing, measuring, moving people, moving goods \u2013 extended to Shikoku, to\nKyushu, and halfway up Honshu. As provinces and commanderies were set up across more and\nof the islands, the Yamato court\u2019s power increased.\nThe chiefs agreed to give up their autonomy and instead become members of an\norganized aristocracy, ruled by and serving as officials in a central, Legalist state, because they\nwere afraid that Tang and Silla armies might invade the islands. To block entry at the easiest,\noldest point of access, in 663 the court set up an office in Kyushu, right where immigration from\nthe peninsula had started the process of civilizational transfer many centuries earlier.12\nDescent from the Sun-Goddess\nThe final important steps in Yamato centralization were taken by Tenji\u2019s brother Temmu\n(r. 672-686) and his wife Jit\u014d (d.702). Temmu was the first Japanese ruler, and when he died Jit\u014d\nwas the second, to use the title \u201ctenn\u014d\u201d \u5929\u7687 \u201cheavenly shining,\u201d which, like the Qin term\nhuangdi \u7687\u5e1d, we translate as \u201cemperor\u201d or \u201cempress.\u201d (Empress Wu of Tang borrowed the title).\nTemmu and Jit\u014d centralized power with both organization and ideology. In terms of\norganization, they decreed that only their direct descendants could hold the throne. They\nrewarded their supporters with Tang-style court ranks and with positions in a Tang-style\ngovernment structure centered on the court. They convinced aristocrats, the former chiefs, to\ntheir acquiescence in central control through bureaucracy in exchange for these honors and\nofficial posts. Like the Qin emperor, Temmu and Jit\u014d moved the aristocrats to their new capital\ncity, away from their original territories. They busied the former chiefs with an extensive\ncalendar of Buddhist and Shinto rituals. They set them to learning Chinese, and studying the\nclassics, poetry, painting and calligraphy, music and dance. Legalist government and mainland\nculture, funneled largely through the peninsula, tamed the clans.\nAcross East Asia, rulers had claimed to be descended from illustrious figures. For\ninstance, the Tang imperial family had claimed descent from Laozi, mythical author of the Dao\nDe Jing, who had become a god. Kogury\u014f and Paekche both claimed descent from the royal\nhouse of the northern state of Puy\u014f.13 Such claims made sense in an aristocratic age, when\npeople\u2019s quality depended on the status of their birth families. So now, to legitimate the\nprinciple that only their direct descendants could hold the throne, co-rulers Temmu and Jit\u014d\nstressed that each clan\u2019s status had originally come from their descent from a god of some kind.\nAnd, the co-rulers stressed, the Yamato line \u2013 their ancestors \u2013 descended from the sun-\ngoddess Amaterasu. She had installed her grandson Hononinigi as the first ruler of Japan; his\ndescendant was the emperor Jimmu, who conquered the whole archipelago in 660 BC; and from\nhim the throne had descended within the Yamato family in an unbroken succession down to\nTemmu, himself a deity. To institutionalize this idea of imperial descent from Great Goddess\nAmaterasu, she was made top god in a Shinto pantheon that included all the clan deities. In the\nbureaucracy, the Council of Kami Affairs was placed beside the Council of State, right under the\nChapter 7, p. 14 155\nemperor, and given the responsibility for organizing, developing, and administering Great\nGoddess shrines, rituals, offerings, priests, and patronage. The Ise Grand Shrine to the Goddess\nhosted the most spectacular rituals conducted by the highest-ranking Shinto priests. A huge\namount of ritual regulation about worship of Amaterasu was written into the Engishiki.14 The\ncourt rejected the designation Wa, and named their country \u201cOrigin of the Sun\u201d (Nippon \u65e5\u672c),\nor \u201cJapan.\u201d\nFig. 7.6.

Public Domain.\nTo impose this false narrative \u2013 for as you know there was not even an unbroken Yamato\ndescent line going back to Y\u016bryaku, let alone further back than that \u2013 Temmu and Jit\u014d began\nsponsoring historiography. Their daughter-in-law (and Jit\u014d\u2019s half-sister) Genmei (r. 707-715)\nChapter 7, p. 15 156\ncontinued the project. The results, both written in classical Chinese, were the Records of Ancient\nMatters (Kojiki, 712), and Chronicles (Nihon Shoki, 720, a mainland-style official history).\nAlong with other older myths of gods and heroes, and more accurate historical accounts, they\nembedded stories promoting the unbroken Yamato connection to the goddess. As people died\nand texts lived, over the centuries those stories came to be ardently believed, like the stories of\nYao, Shun, and Yu, dynastic founders across East Asia, and other myths.\nMap R: The Japanese archipelago, showing the location of Hei\u2019an (today\u2019s Kyoto); Ise where Amaterasu\nhad her most important shrine; Kamakura; and the farthest northern forts established by the Nara/Hei\u2019an\nregime. Hokkaido, the large island north of Honshu, was completely independent of the Yamato court\nuntil at least 1400, but people there, later dubbed Ainu, traded with Honshu for iron.\nThe Nara Period (710-784)\nAs well as overseeing the histories, Genmei built a new capital city between 708 and 712,\nNara. The Yamato court had gradually moved beyond thatched wooden halls, abandoned at the\nChapter 7, p. 16 157\ndeath of each ruler to avoid pollution. Jit\u014d had built a first Tang-style capital in 694. Genmei\u2019s\ncapital Nara, slightly to the north, replaced it. The new capital housed a centralized\nadministration that, when it took final form with the Taih\u014d Code (701), included household\nregistration, taxation including military service for all commoner men, the minting of coins, and\nthe Tang equal fields system of redistributing fields after a census taken every six years. Coastal\nand mountain resources, though far more important to the economy than they were on the\nmainland, were not included, because the Tang model excluded them.\nNara housed an imperial academy where four hundred young aristocrats studied the\nClassics, calligraphy, mathematics, law, and how to pronounce Chinese characters in Chinese.\n(They could be read in Japanese pronunciation, too, and simplified versions of characters were\nused to represent Japanese language \u2013 a system called hiragana.) Theoretically there were\nschools in each province, too. But the provincial schools could not find enough teachers, and\nthe academy\u2019s promise of meritocratic advancement proved hollow: not only were government\npositions dominated by the top clans, but even teaching posts at the academy became hereditary.\nProbably only 20,000 people out of the population of five or six million could read at all.\nAs more literate people learned about Confucianism, Empress K\u014dken in 757 required\nevery household to own the Classic of Filial Piety. But as in Tang, it is quite unlikely that that\nhappened, and impossible that everyone could read it. More likely, the Classic of Filial Piety\nwas distributed as a kind of magical object. For in 770, Empress Sh\u014dtoku also had a million\nprinted copies of a charm written in Sanskrit, each in a miniature pagoda, distributed. Nara-\nperiod emperors promoted Buddhism by creating a national network of temples, carrying out\nBuddhist rituals, promulgating scriptures, and so on.\nFig. 7.7. One of the \u201cOne Million Pagodas\u201d with printed charms distributed by order of Empress Sh\u014dtoku\nto thank Buddhist deities for helping suppress a rebellion in 764. Scholars do not agree about whether the\ncharms were printed using woodblocks or bronze plates. Either way, they are among the oldest printed\ntexts in the world. Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nThe T\u014ddaiji (Great Eastern Temple) built by Emperor Sh\u014dmu in Nara is today the world\u2019s\nlargest wooden structure. When we consider that until the reign of Empress Suiko, in 592, the\nChapter 7, p. 17 158\ncourt itself had been living in wooden huts, the enormous temple shows how quickly\narchitectural knowledge had grown. Because of the international Buddhist tradition of grand\nscale, Buddhism was perhaps even more useful than Shinto for expressing the centrality of the\nmonarch, as the northern mainland regimes had done in the period of division. It could subsume\nShinto gods and send political messages that way. For example, the T\u014ddaiji\u2019s sixty-four-foot\nhigh gilded bronze Buddha was accompanied by a small shrine to an important Shinto deity of\nKyushu, where a rebel group of Fujiwara was defeated: once they submitted to the Yamato court,\nthey were re-incorporated in a supporting role, as the small statue symbolized. The blazing gold\nBuddha, surrounded by smaller figures, sent a clear message that the ruler who created it was\ndivine, powerful, and rich.\nAs was true later for the USA, that power resided partly in the control of natural\nresources that had scarcely been tapped. Historian Conrad Totman argues that the temples built\nin Japan between 600 and 850 required almost four million cubic yards of wood. Building the\nT\u014ddaiji temple complex \u2013 initially two nine-story pagodas and a meeting hall measuring about 50\nby 86 yards \u2013 would have taken the timber grown on about 3.4 square miles.\nAfter T\u014ddaiji burned down in 1180, there was little local wood, because so many other\ntemples and mansions had been built. The court had to build 118 dams to create water flows to\ncarry suitable timber from all over Japan. Firing bricks and clay tiles, and making the mortar to\nhold bricks together, required so much that by the Hei\u2019an period, the kilns had been moved 50\nmiles from the capital where wood was still available. Quarrying clay and stone meant further\nenvironmental costs.15\nBuddhism took a huge toll on the landscape everywhere in Asia, not just in Japan.Tang\nEmpress Wu built a wooden tower almost 1,000 feet tall, which housed a statue of Maitreya over\n900 feet tall. As well as demonstrating imperial piety, and channeling supernatural support for\ndynasties, these immense structures vividly communicated the vast power of the donors \u2013 the\nrulers \u2013 over land and labor. Lumberjacks, and carpenters, and the specialized craftspeople who\nmade the gold, silver, silk, items for those elaborate temples and their ceremonies, and the monks\nand nuns themselves, and the musicians \u2013 all those people who had to be fed by someone else, so\nthe royal donors had to control vast quantities of grain. Agriculture intensified in this period,\nfurther affecting the landscape.\nNot only did they have to work harder to pay taxes, but farming families suffered further\nbecause, of course, it was ordinary people who built the huge temples and palaces. Totman has\nargued that workers were gathered and settled in labor camps to build the temples, and suffered\nfrom all the ills that living in temporary shelters brings: cold, hunger, sorrow, and sickness.16\nThe crafts were dangerous, too. Wooden statues could be gilded by pressing gold leaf\nonto a sticky lacquer layer. Craftsmen under Empress Wu Zhao of Tang shaped a huge Buddha\n(so large its pinky finger could hold many people) of clay, wrapped it in cloth, painted it with\nlayers of lacquer, and then shattered and removed the clay core.17 But the T\u014ddaiji\u2019s large\nBuddha figure, and many others across East Asia, were of bronze. Gilding bronze involves an\narduous ten-step process that includes painting the figure with a mixture of mercury and gold,\nand slowly burning off the mercury as gas. Not only did gilding the T\u014ddaiji Buddha take five\nyears (752-757), and use yet more wood, but the craftspeople, even if they were protected by\nChapter 7, p. 18 159\nmasks, inhaled the mercury gas, suffering nerve and organ damage.18 Central control over\npeople and natural resources hurt both.\nSilla State Structure\nSilla had been the last of the Korean Three Kingdoms to begin consolidation. With its\nlate and scant written records, its history is hard to trace. Silla arose from the Chinhan tribal\nconfederation in the southeastern peninsula. It centered on six villages or clans \u2013 the most\nimportant being Hwe and Sahwe \u2013 but the chiefs had come, armed and mounted, from\nManchuria and the northern peninsula, and they never fully integrated with the locals they\ndominated. The Silla ruling husband and wife Naemul (r. 356-402) and Poban (r. approx. same)\nsent envoys along with a diplomatic mission from Kogury\u014f to one of the mainland regimes, early\nin the development of a Silla kingship; shortly thereafter Silla rulers took on a new title. In about\n500, Silla formed as a duarchy, with a primary ruler from the Hwe and a backup from the Sahwe\nclan. Silla adopted Sinitic knowledge and mainland technology primarily from Kogury\u014f,\nsecondarily from Paekche, and only indirectly from the mainland before the mid-seventh century.\nAs a measure of openness to imports, Silla declared Buddhism an official religion only in 535, a\ncentury and half after Paekche and Kogury\u014f, and about the same time as Yamato.\nDespite its late development, Silla was the kingdom that unified most of the peninsula.\nBut that unification, scholars agree, was only a surface phenomenon, when compared with its\ncontemporaries, Sui and Tang, on the one hand, and the later Kory\u014f on the other. More on this\nin the next chapter.\nSilla monarchs remained weak, barely elevated above the aristocracy descended from\nearlier clan chiefs. Like Yamato, Silla did adopt the junxian system of Legalist rule, dividing the\nwhole conquered part of the peninsula (Parhae held the northernmost part of the peninsula) into\nnine commanderies (called \u201cprovinces\u201d) with counties below them. Recent discoveries of\nvillage records suggest that a central fiscal ministry counted and controlled households and the\nland they worked. Silla set up a postal system to carry imperial commands, and bureaux for\nclassical and Confucian learning and astronomy. It carried out ambitious irrigation projects to\npromote agricultural productivity.\nOne point on which preserved sources and the Samguk yusa agree is the details of\nBuddhist ceremonies to protect the state, which continued to be very important right through the\nSilla period.19 The court built both wooden Buddhist temples in mainland style and temples cut\nout of rock (most famous is the S\u014fkkuram Grotto), and deployed its artisans\u2019 old skills with gold\nto create graceful, elegant gold images of bodhisattvas. While other East Asian monarchs had\ndeployed similar moves to centralize power, few Silla monarchs could stand up to the aristocrats\nat court. Silla aristocrats blocked almost all attempts to admit to high office newcomers, or even\nmen of slightly lower aristocratic rank.\nNot the monarch alone, but a council of high-ranking aristocrats made policy. Stone\nsteles from the early sixth century refer to a decision by the highest-ranking seven men of Silla\nsettling a property dispute, and record a public announcement by the council. More than two\ncenturies later there is a record of the council deciding policy by unanimous vote (surely\npreceded by long discussion). When the monarch left no heir, it was the council that decided on\nthe next monarch, and such lapses of course provided the greatest opportunities for aristocratic\nChapter 7, p. 19 160\nfactions to maneuver at court. The fact that King Muy\u014fl left a competent first son to become\nKing Munmu (\u6587\u6b66r. 661-681), and that he in turn left a competent eldest son, made it easier for\nthese monarchs to centralize, for they were not beholden to the council for their thrones.20\nMunmu completed the defeat of Paekche, Kogury\u014f, and Tang. To rein in both Buddhist\nwealth and aristocratic display, he prohibited donations to Buddhist temples without government\napproval. He set up an \u201cOffice of the Great Religion\u201d through which secular officials managed\nmonks, as had been done in Northern Qi and in Japan.21 He vowed to become a dragon,\nprotecting Silla\u2019s eastern coast, so after death he was cremated, scattered at sea, and\ncommemorated with an undersea turtle-shaped marker on a rocky crag along the coast. His\nsuccessor, King Sinmum (681-692), managed to purge the most powerful aristocrats from\ngovernment, appoint lesser nobles to important positions, and choose his own cabinet of\nministers: an increase of royal power that lasted about a hundred years. King Ky\u014fngd\u014fk (r. 742-\n765) tried to strengthen Confucian learning and recruit officials meritocratically, but with little\nsuccess. Compared with Tang, Silla monarchs remained relatively weak vis-\u00e0-vis the aristocracy.\nBut like Yamato and Nara monarchs, they included queens as well as kings.\nEmpress Wu Zhao in East Asian Context\nSong-era historians looked back in amazement at the career of the Tang\u2019s only woman\nemperor, Wu Zhao (Wu Zetian) (624/5-705). In amazement \u2013 and distaste. Song gender roles\nwere more clearly differentiated and more thoroughly moralized. To explain how the brilliant\nmale poets and scholar-officials of Tang could have worked under a mere woman, Song\nintellectual invented tales about her ruthlessness \u2013 just as the patrilinealists of Latter Han had\nsmeared Empress L\u00fc. Given the patterns of East Asian rulership described in this chapter,\nhowever, Empress Wu was not so very odd in her own time.\nWu Zhao\u2019s merchant father had provided money and advice to the Tang founder when he\nseized power. Her mother was a high-ranking woman from the Sui royal family. Wu Zhao\nentered palace life as a teenager in 637, officially married to Tang Taizong as a very low-ranking\nconsort. He paid little attention to her, but when he died, she entered a nunnery with the rest of\nthe palace women. Taizong\u2019s ninth son and successor, Gaozong, married her in 650 as a\nsecondary consort. Despite opposition from many aristocrats, he elevated her to Empress in 655\nafter she had borne three children. The pair ruled jointly from 660 to about 673, as Temmu and\nJit\u014d were doing at the same time in Japan, and as Naemul and Poban had done earlier in Silla.\nWhen Gaozong became ill, she ruled for him until he died in 683, and then continued to\nhold power as several sons tried and failed to push her aside. In 684, some Tang princes (not her\nsons) rebelled, but the army supported Wu Zhao. In 690, Wu Zhao crowned herself emperor of a\nnew dynasty. She called it \u201cZhou\u201d to underline her claim to be descended from Zhou royalty\ngoing all the way back to King Wu, King Wen, and ultimately to Jiang Yuan, who became\npregnant with Lord Millet, ancestor of the Zhou dynasty and inventor of agriculture, after\nstepping in a god\u2019s footprint.\nLike other medieval rulers, Wu and Gaozong drew on many different ideas to strengthen\ntheir rule. First, Confucianism. The pair presented themselves as serving the popular welfare so\nas to hold onto the Mandate of Heaven, and were called \u201cthe Two Sages.\u201d Wu Zhao created a\nChapter 7, p. 20 161\npublic role for herself that accorded with gendered roles, by instructing women and worshiping\nthe silkworm deity, for instance. In ruling for Gaozong when he was ill, she displayed wifely\nloyalty, and won the support of officials in governing (and managing the alliance with Silla).\nAfter Gaozong\u2019s death, officials supported her continued rule in the role of wise mother when\nthe heir-apparent, Li Xian, proved feckless: he had been stockpiling armor for a coup d\u2019etat and\nsupposedly offered the throne to his father-in-law. Wu Zhao built up further legitimacy in the\nsix years after Gaozong\u2019s death by linking herself with classical magic architecture and omens,\nall within a Confucian framework. And she promoted use of the civil service examinations,\nhoping to recruit men from lower-ranked aristocratic families through a meritocratic process.\nSecond, Gaozong and Wu Zhao continued Tang sponsorship of Daoism. Both wrote\nprefaces to accompany a vast collection of Daoist scriptures. They awarded the deified Laozi\n(supposedly Gaozong\u2019s ancestor) new titles. Their youngest daughter, the Taiping princess, was\nordained as a Daoist priestess. They made a pilgrimage to a Daoist mountain together. And they\ndecreed that the civil service examinations had to include questions on the Dao De Jing.22\nFig. 7.8 Two portions of the Diamond Sutra printed in Tang in 868. A son had many copies printed for\nwide distribution, to earn spiritual merit for his parents. The picture is appropriate to this filial action: it\nshows the Buddha preaching to an aged follower. The sutra was sealed up in the Buddhist caves in\nDunhuang around 1000 and re-discovered in 1900. The source (www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-diamond-\nsutra) has more information and close-up images. Public Domain.\nChapter 7, p. 21 162\nThird, Wu Zhao was firmly embedded in the international culture of her time: A team\nthat included Korean and Persian architects cooperated to build one of her monuments.23 So of\ncourse, like monarchs all across Asia, Wu Zhao believed in and drew on Buddhism. Throughout\nher public life, from 651-704, she associated herself with Buddhist virtue and deities, stressing\nmercy and compassion. She publicized a Buddhist sutra that prophesied the incarnation of\nMaitreya, Buddha of the future, in the form of a woman, as a legitimation of her own dynasty. In\n693, she proclaimed herself a \u010dakravartin, wheel-turning king, like Ashoka. One scholar has\nargued that her vow to promulgate hundreds of thousands of Buddhist texts led to the invention\nof printing, based on ancient pattern-stamp technology.24 (Wu Zhao also invented special\nChinese characters used only in her reign.) The earliest extant precisely-dated printed book in\nthe world is a copy of the Diamond Sutra made on May 11, 868.\nWu Zhao was indeed ruthless \u2013 like male rulers. Her nominal first husband, Tang\nTaizong, after all, had killed his brothers and nephews when he forced his father to cede the\nthrone in 626. She did remove sons whom she found stupid or disobedient, but the later stories\nabout killing her own children do not appear even as vague rumors in sources close to her time.\nShe did implement a reign of terror between 683 and 697, arresting and even killing real and\npotential political enemies among the aristocratic families. But she never expanded terror to the\nwhole population (unlike twentieth-century regimes), nor did she abandon the broader goals of\ngood government. While more successful than most male rulers, she was not more brutal.\nAt the age of about 80, Wu Zhao retired. One of her sons took the throne, and rejected the\nZhou dynastic name, reestablishing Tang.25 Song historians regarded her as unique, and\nportrayed her as demonically clever and ruthless. But in her own time, she was not the only\nfemale ruler in East Asia, and her activities fit well into East Asian ruling patterns.\n1 This anecdote courtesy of Tom Manazec.

But along with what was\nshared, government varied, as we saw in Chapter Seven, and so did culture. For in each place the\nshared Sinitic and Buddhist heritage combined with the local Shinto gods and demons, customs,\nlanguages, stories, music, art, and lifeways. In each place, the rulers and members of the\naristocratic elite shaped inherited tradition in power struggles. One aspect of the Sinitic tradition\nthat lived on only in texts and rhetoric was the idea that meritocratic recruitment could include\ncommoners. For this was an aristocratic age across East Asia: family determined destiny.\nThe Tang period (618-906) has been called \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d and \u201ca golden age.\u201d It drew\nvisitors from across Asia, and from the Middle East, and incorporated not only Buddhism but\ninfluences from greater Persia into its art, architecture, and literature. The greatest poets of the\nChinese language were Tang scholars and officials, and great short stories were written as mere\nexercises to show off a man\u2019s talent to the official overseeing his civil service exam. Tang\nmodels were appealing enough to win adoption by Silla (668-935) and, as the next chapter will\ndiscuss, by the Yamato court in the Nara (710-794) and Hei\u2019an (794-1180) periods.\nEthnicity\nSui founding emperor Yang Jian (541-604), who ruled as Wendi, and his empress both\nillustrate the difficulty of categorizing anyone in the mainland as \u201cChinese\u201d or \u201cnon-Chinese\u201d in\nthe medieval period. Yang Jian was born in the heartland between the old capitals of Chang\u2019an\nand Loyang, but his ancestors for six generations back had worked on the northwestern frontier\nand intermarried with Turko-Mongol (Xianbei) families there. His father worked for the\nNorthern Wei until it split in half, and then for a Xianbei ruler. His education was as mixed as\nhis lineage. Until he was ten years old, Yang Jian was raised by a Buddhist nun; he then learned\nhunting and riding, and attended a Confucian school in the capital. At age thirteen he was\nappointed to office and rose quickly, perhaps because of his powerful father. At age sixteen he\nmarried a thirteen-year-old girl descended from a very high-ranking northern Chinese family on\none side and from several Turko-Mongol families that served the Northern Wei on the other side.\nShe was highly educated in the Sinitic tradition, good at practical management, and a devout\nBuddhist. The young couple vowed to marry no-one else, and eventually had at least ten\nchildren together.1 Their mixed cultural heritage was typical of the ruling class.\nSucceeding Sui, the Tang royal family, surnamed Li, also came from Turkic and Central\nAsian groups. The Tang founder, Gaozu, had made his eldest son heir apparent, but the second\nson, claiming that there was a plot against his own life, killed his elder brother and forced his\nfather to abdicate in 626. Sanping Chen argues that this was not merely the usual brutal behavior\nof royalty, but an instance of Turkic practice of \u201ctanistry.\u201d In contrast to the Zhou model of\ntrunk and branch lineages with the eldest son of the primary wife inheriting \u2013 a pattern reinforced\nby Han patrilinealists \u2013 tanistry meant that the most qualified son, or the one who could gather\nthe most support among the ruling group, inherited leadership.

Foreign merchants including Jews, Arabs,\nPersians, and South Asians established communities in the capital and the Tang ports of\nGuangzhou (Canton), Quanzhou, and Yangzhou, buying silk, porcelain, and copper- and iron-\nware to sell back home. The Yamato court and Silla sent members of the elite to study in Tang;\nin 837 alone, a state record counted 216 Silla men studying in Tang.2 The special Tang\nexamination for foreigners, which 58 Silla men passed, was a route into office back in Silla for\nChapter 8, p. 2 166\nhead-rank six men; but others migrated to Tang and stayed there. A tomb inscription of about\n693 tells us that the wife\u2019s surname was Xue (= S\u014fl, \u859b); her head-rank six family had served the\nSilla dynasty for generations, until her father became a Tang military general. The inscription\nalso claimed that Xue was descended from a very early Korean king.3\nMadam Xue\u2019s tomb inscription is not the only example of Tang incorporating\ninternational military talent. After the defeat of Kogury\u014f, up to 5% of its population was moved\nto the mainland, and the descendants of both Kogury\u014f and Paekche immigrants entered Tang\nmilitary service.4 The son of a former Kogury\u014f general (Gao Xianzhi) carried out Tang foreign\npolicy in Central Asia.\nFigs. 8.2 and 8.3 Tang Tomb figurines.

An was adopted by the imperial consort Yang\nGuifei, and Emperor Xuanzong trusted him so deeply that he wished to make him Prime Minister,\nalthough he was apparently illiterate. In 755, General An, in charge of a hundred thousand\ntroops fighting the Khitans in Manchuria, rebelled against Tang. Emperor Xuanzong and his\nconsort Yang Guifei fled Loyang (his troops murdered her along the way, causing him \u2013 stories\nsay \u2013 \u201ceverlasting sorrow\u201d), but An Lushan was eventually defeated \u2013 by Uighur troops allied\nwith Tang. If An Lushan had succeeded in replacing Tang, it would have been the third\nsuccessive dynastic change via coup d\u2019etat by a mixed-ethnicity general overthrowing the mixed-\nethnicity emperor for whom he worked.\nEven below the elite level, medieval Chinese people, from the fall of Han through the\nTang, spoke many languages, cooked many cuisines, wore many styles of clothing, and carried\nout different family rituals. And people of different cultures intermarried and raised children\ntogether. Ethnic categories were flexible, while examination degrees, Sinitic education, and high\nsocial rank were meaningful across international boundaries.\nFig. 8.4 Octagonal hammered silver cup with ring handle and chased design.

Public Domain.\nChapter 8, p. 4 168\nTang Taizong learned court style from a Sassanid shah in Persia (Iran). The imperial\nfamily ate off gold and silver vessels in Persian styles. Horses from Persia were Taizong\u2019s pride,\nin war and in peace; Tang ceramic sculptures of polo-players, male and female, survive from\nmany tombs. In Xuanzong\u2019s reign, courtiers loved Persian music and dance. The famous poet\nLi Bai immortalized one dancer as \u201cthe whirling girl,\u201d but rebel general An Lushan and\nXuanzong\u2019s true love, Yang Guifei, both also excelled in the dance.5\nThe court purchased or demanded as tribute most of the luxury goods imported to Tang:\nsandalwood, ivory, frankincense, spices, jewels, and pearls that came in from countries well-\nrepresented in Tang geographical works \u2013 Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,\nIndia, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq \u2013 as well as less well-known countries like Bahrain, Oman, Yemen,\nand even Tanzania. Tang merchants sailed to Japan, Korea, and southeast Asia, and reached\nIndia and even the Persian gulf by about 850.6 Within the empire, amazing skirts, raincoats,\ncloaks, and other garments made of colorful feathers were created for Tang royalty, aristocrats,\nand soldiers in such numbers as to drive some birds almost into extinction, according to the\nofficial New Tang History written in Song times.7 The Tang court displayed its power through\nthese goods as did other kings across East Asia.\nWith these prestige goods, music, games, and elaborate rituals, as well as the foreign\nmerchants, monks, and others who visited and settled there, Tang created a court and capital so\nrich and appealing that members of the aristocratic elite flocked there from north and south. They\nleft their family estates to be managed by others, eager to serve in the central government, and\nreluctant to leave the exciting capital. Of course, they had to serve as officials all over the\nempire, but official postings south of the Yangzi River, not to speak of the far south around\nGuangzhou, were used as punishments. Such exile might easily kill a northerner not used to the\nheat and to malaria. Compensating for the danger were the fabulous fortunes to be made by\nmilking the lucrative overseas trade of the southern ports. Since aristocratic social status came\nfrom their illustrious lineage first, and only secondarily from office rank, and since they had\nfamily estates and did not necessarily need the salary that came with office, they could\nsometimes refuse such posts.\nTang Social Structure\nThe Super-Elite: Four Aristocracies Conjoined\nA writer of Song times, when the Tang aristocracy had vanished, Shen Gua, likened Tang\nsociety to the caste system in India with its rigid inherited distinctions. At the top of Tang\nsociety stood the super-elite. They belonged to four separate aristocracies, each made up of\nmany clans documented in various lists and genealogies; some such lists have been found\npreserved among the cave archives at Dunhuang.\nFirst, the clans of the northeast (Hebei) claimed to represent the purest Chinese tradition\nof the Classics and Confucianism, with family lines reaching back to Han times. They married\nonly among themselves \u2013 unless a prospective mate was very wealthy indeed. They considered\nthe Tang royal family of Li to be mere social upstarts. Taizong challenged that view in 632, only\nto learn to his dismay that genealogical research supported it.\nSecond, the clans of the northwest. They included the Sui and Tang ruling houses and\nothers who had served under the northern dynasties, had Turkic roots, and maintained central\nChapter 8, p. 5 169\nAsian customs and contacts. Northwesterners thought themselves superior because of their\nmilitary and governing abilities, but they had also adopted Sinitic tradition and Confucian family\npractices. Third: the great clans of northern Shanxi, who also had central Asian contacts. Fourth\ncame the wealthy Yangzi valley clans of the Southern Dynasties, originally Han-era clans. They\ntook pride in their elegant culture, but northerners scorned them as southern barbarians. The four\nregional aristocracies formed the super-elite of Tang society until the end of the period.\nFig. 8.5 Covered inkstone in the shape of a turtle, with the eight trigrams of the Book of Changes\ninscribed on its back. Review Chapter One and think about why it made sense to present the trigrams on a\nturtle shell, and use that for writing. Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nChapter 8, p. 6 170\nThe super-elite clans had each developed in a certain place going back to Han or Wei-Jin\ntimes. Each had not only with a surname, such as Cui, that would be shared by many others, but\nalso with the name of their home base, such as Boling. They had a strong sense of family\ntradition and history, documented in genealogies that listed clan members with successful\npolitical careers. (A branch of a clan that failed to produce officials for a couple of generations\nwould be dropped from the clan\u2019s records.) Kinfolk, matrilineal as well as patrilineal, were\nimportant in sponsoring the next generation for high-ranking posts, so they married only with\ntheir social equals. Kin networks constituted the most important resource of the super-elite.\nHigh office provided not only prestige, but a considerable salary that reinforced kin\nnetworks. Men holding the fifth-highest levels of government office earned salaries in coin that\ncould buy over 21,000 pounds of rice a year, as well as allowances for servants and\nmiscellaneous expenses. If people ate 2,000 calories a day, that means an official at rank five\ncould feed 38 people. The amounts rose steeply for the top four levels. A top official was\nexpected to support not only an entourage of servants, but a large number of family members.8\nThe state was organized to enable the elite to protect their most important resource: kin.\nMembers of the elite commanded deference from those below them, and each knew how\nto defer to his own superiors in age, rank, or status. By law their punishments were lighter. They\nhad sumptuary privileges \u2013 the right to wear certain clothes, drive certain carriages, and so on.\nAfter moving to the capital region, they initially kept up the connection with the home place \u2013\neven clan members who lived and died in the capital were buried back home until late in Tang\ntimes. That meant that everyone would meet at the tombs on certain festivals. As time went on,\nhowever, the clans spent less and less time back home, eventually abandoning their real estate\nthere; they preferred to be in the capital. Historians used to think that disconnection from those\nhome bases ultimately brought them down, but that was true only indirectly, as we shall see.\nWhat did the great clans of Tang times not have, compared with other elites? First, their\nhome estates were not like Zhou feudal domains. They had to pay taxes, and in the north they\ndid not even own the land \u2013 the Tang central state did. In the south, estates were divided among\nsons, so they did not last long or expand. Clan members and their tenants were all subject to the\nTang Code and bureaucratic government. Second, they did not have the kind of lineage\norganizations that formed in Song and especially Ming times, in which clans had shared,\ncorporately-held land, and written rules that gave them institutional continuity. Third, unlike the\naristocratic clans of Japan, they did not each have a totem deity. They did not even have\nancestral temples for the whole clan, but merely gathered periodically at the tombs.9\nNevertheless, by hitching their wagon to the Tang state, the super-elite families held on to\nprestige and power right up until about 900; we will see below how they fell.\nScholars, Commoners, and Slaves\nBelow the super-elite, a hundred or so prominent clans in each locality, called shi zu or\n\u201cscholar clans,\u201d constituted the middle range of the aristocracy. They recognized one another as\ngood families, and cultivated family solidarity through rituals centered on ancestral temples and\ngraves, through formality of relations between the generations and the sexes, through an ethic of\ndiscipline and responsibility to the family, and through traditions of learning. They held office\nand served the Tang state in many capacities.\nChapter 8, p. 7 171\nA third set of families constituted the lower elite, powerful in their local areas, but with\nlittle chance of holding high office in the state.\nBelow all these aristocrats was the vast group of commoners, called \u201cgood people\u201d (\u826f\n\u6c11). Unlike in the first empire, commoners held no rank, but they were respectable. Below\nthem were private retainers, who belonged to other households, but could legally marry\ncommoners. Below them were base people (\u8ce4\u6c11), a category that included groups who\nhereditarily performed polluting tasks like music and acting, prostitution, and tending to the dead.\nSlaves were also base people.\nSome slaves were purchased along the silk roads. For instance, after Tang conquered the\nkingdom of Gaochang in 640, Tang issued market contracts that validated the sale of slaves there.\nOne excavated travel permit lists seven slaves with names like \u201cModel Trustworthiness\u201d and\n\u201cSubmit to Orders.\u201d Among four travel parties of Tang officials, two-thirds of the laborers listed\nwere slaves belonging to the officials.10 As in Han times commoners could slide down the social\nscale to become slaves, if a kinsman committed a serious crime, or to pay a debt; but unlike in\nHan times, there was no rising out of slavery again. In dramatic contrast to the Legalist principle\nthat the state came first, a slave who informed on his master for any crime less than treason was\nliable to be judicially strangled. And unlike in Han times when a freed slave carried no taint,\neven manumission did not dissolve the obligation of a slave to be loyal to his former master.\nSlaves were supposed to marry only other slaves, because the distinction of rank was so\nimportant.\nFig. 8.6 Earthenware, with traces of pigment. Tomb figurines. Seated musicians, late seventh century.\nHow does each instrument work? Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nTang Government Structure\nThe inherited prestige and power of elite families, which had been growing since mid-\nHan, meant that Tang imperial bureaucratic government differed significantly from the Legalist\nmodel of the first empire. The central government still registered and taxed everyone, and\nChapter 8, p. 8 172\nestablished law and administrative regulations for the whole country. It paid officials salaries\nrather than granting them land. But in other ways, the second empire\u2019s government was quite\ndifferent from the first empire, Qin and Han.\nFig. 8.7.

The Tang state recruited officials in three ways. First, one\ncould be a member of a clan with a close relationship to the imperial house, the Li clan. Second,\na close relative already in office could designate a son or nephew for office, which was called the\n\u201cshadow privilege,\u201d but it would not be the same office that he himself held, so that bureaucratic\nrotation was possible. About 90% of offices were supplied through the shadow privilege. Third,\nthe route for a minority of Tang officials was to pass the civil service examinations. Tang rulers,\nand the Empress Wu especially, did use the examination system to recruit newer talent into\ngovernment, but the exams did not challenge aristocratic power. The \u201cnew men\u201d were\nthemselves lower aristocrats, not commoners. Moreover, the highest offices were held by men\nof about thirty families, and a really top post required a personal connection to the imperial Li\nChapter 8, p. 9 173\nclan or another very powerful person. This meant that the super-elite \u2013 like the Latter Han big\nclans from whom some of them sprang \u2013 could block policy changes that threatened their power.\nA new set of laws, the Tang Code, provided the basic law of the land and was adopted by\ncentralizing regimes in the peninsula and archipelago. It was based on a legal code designed for\nEmperor Wu of Liang, gentler than that of Han (in accordance with his Buddhist beliefs), and it\nincluded both northern and southern legal elements. The Tang Code applied to the whole\npopulation, but treated people differently according to their family of birth. Following Tuoba\nWei precedent, the Code divided people into three broad categories: the privileged, respectable\ncommoners, and inferior or base people.\nA person\u2019s category of birth and social roles had very real effects. By law, the same\ncrime earned lighter sentences for the privileged \u2013 imperial relatives and high officials \u2013 and\nheavier sentences for the base. Punishments for commoners varied by age, sex, mental and\nphysical health, and relationship to the victim. The very young, very old, and women, for\ninstance, generally got lighter sentences. Some provisions legalized Confucian patrilineal norms:\nsomeone who murdered his father earned a heavier penalty that someone who murdered a\nstranger, for instance, and sons and wives were punished for hitting fathers and husbands, but\nfathers and husbands were not punished for hitting sons and wives. And contrary to Qin and Han\nlaw, family juniors were supposed to report seniors\u2019 crimes only if they directly threatened the\nstate. Crime and punishment varied by social rank and relationships, but the law was uniform\nthroughout the empire. The exception was foreigners: if a conflict arose between two people\nfrom different countries, Tang law applied, and if the two were from the same foreign country,\nthat country\u2019s law applied.\nIn managing land and labor, Tang bureaucratic government remedied the weaknesses of\nnorthern and southern regimes, while adopting their useful innovations. Tang taxed its subjects\nin two separate ways, based on their different eco-systems. First, in the drier north, the state\nclaimed most of the land and adopted the Tuoba Wei \u201cequal-field\u201d system to parcel it out to\nfarming men for their lifetimes; evidence from land registers preserved in dry Dunhuang shows\nthat the state actually had the information and power to enforce the system. In the equal-field\nsystem, each man between the ages of 21 and 59 received the same amount of land, and owed the\nstate about three bushels of grain, seven meters of silk cloth or eight of hemp or ramie cloth, and\ntwenty days of labor. The labor and grain could be commuted to cloth payments. Only\nhusbands were liable for the tax, but wives made the cloth, which constituted most of the\npayment; so it was the women who supported the state most directly. (Moreover, since there was\na shortage of coin and counterfeiting was rampant, cloth was the most common, stable, and\ntransportable form of currency in Tang; so weaving wives were literally making money.) Unlike\nin Qin, military conscription was not universal, but was a special service that won a man\nexemption from labor conscription. Despite the changes in details, Tang systems still relied on\nthe Qin information revolution to micro-manage taxation.\nSecond, in the commercialized south, where the Jiankang empire had collected tax in\nmoney, the Tang government did not implement the equal-field system, but collected tax grain\naccording to the amount of land a family owned. Tang also taxed families in money based on\ntheir other property \u2013 not much, an average of 240 coins per household, providing only about\none-twentieth of the value of the grain-cloth-labor taxes in the equal field system.11\nChapter 8, p. 10 174\nFollowing through on the idea that government should serve the public, the Tang state\nalso engaged in what we might call \u201ctax theatre.\u201d Jiankang imperial officials had earned\nreputations for astonishing levels of corruption, including rip-offs like forcing foreign merchants\nto sell goods to them at half price, then reselling at the regular price. To avoid association with\nthat bad reputation, the Tang central government disavowed interest in profiting from the luxury\ntrade, or even taxing maritime trade directly. Instead, it demanded foreign luxury goods as\ntribute from domestic prefectures; but since those prefectures did not produce the items, they had\nto buy them from Canton merchants. \u201cBy doing so,\u201d historian Wang Zhenping explains, \u201cthe\nT\u2019ang court wanted to create for itself an image of a moral and benevolent government.\u201d12 This\nset a precedent for the unrealistic way in which the Japanese state focused its regulations on rice,\nand simply ignored the lucrative maritime trade as a possible source of tax income.13\nPeople did like money, of course; but wealth ran second to rank and family in Tang times.\nFig. 8.8 Han Gan, \u201cNight-shining White,\u201d painted c. 750.

Public Domain.\nChapter 8, p. 11 175\nThe Tang Civil Service Examinations\nFamily and social connections constituted the real strength of the aristocracy: patrilineal\nkin, matrilineal kin, marital connections, and native-place connections all helped assure careers\nand get the work of government done. Good connections enabled the super-elite to send sons to\nstate colleges that funneled men into the bureaucracy. As mentioned above, 90% of offices\nwere filled through the shadow privilege: an official recommending for office a son or nephew.\nBut increasingly, perhaps because of the mainland heritage of meritocracy, Tang men disdained\nto hold office purely by right or through inherited connections. Written examinations became\nthe most prestigious route to office, and the one that lead to the fastest advancement.\nThe examinations tested poetry-writing and calligraphy and secondarily required essays\non philosophical and political issues. In later eras, the civil service examinations did enable\nsome real social mobility. But in Tang times, less than 10% of offices were filled by men\nselected through examinations. That route did become more prestigious over time, so those who\nhad passed the \u201cPresented Scholar\u201d (jinshi) exam rose in the bureaucracy more quickly. But the\ngreat clans maintained their power through the examinations, in Penelope Herbert\u2019s phrase \u201cby\nfair means or foul.\u201d\n\u201cFoul\u201d means of dominating the examinations included bribing corrupt and incompetent\nexam officials, or corrupt local headmen who had to certify who was eligible for exams. \u201cFair\u201d\nmeans involved what we could call \u201csystemic rankism.\u201d Owning books, or having access to the\nlibraries of other noble families was a privilege of the few. Most pupils got their basic schooling\nat home from their fathers, or more often (since they were often away in office or at court) their\nmothers. For this reason, aristocrats could not marry their sons to beautiful or wealthy low-\nranking women, for such people lacked the family tradition of learning. Men without access to\ncould study at Buddhist monasteries, whose libraries held not just scriptures but the Classics and\nliterature as well. But even monasteries did not admit grubby nobodies to their libraries, and one\nstill needed the leisure to learn without having to earn a living.\nAnother aspect of systemic rankism was that taking the examinations required a\nrecommendation, and furthermore, unlike in later eras, the examinations were not taken\nanonymously. Examiners knew the candidates, and were supposed to judge them in part on\ntheir personal (and hence also familial) characteristics. To do well, one had to submit writing\nsamples ahead of time to the chief examiner. (Many Tang tales, like the story of Li Wa the loyal\ncourtesan, were written by scholars for pre-exam presentation.) Candidates visited examiners\nand other influential people ahead of time, to demonstrate their poetic and musical talents, and\ntheir elegant sociability, appearance, and knowledge of etiquette. Feeling fully at home with the\nrules about how to behave really required having grown up in an elite family.\nIn these circumstances, commoners and even members of the scholar clans could not do\ncompete easily against those who had grown up in the highest social circles. If a lower-ranking\nman did indeed demonstrate significant literary talent to succeed in the examination process, he\noften had a dream in which a spirit cut out his heart and guts and replaced them. This miraculous\nbodily transformation explained his extraordinary success. It meant that he really had left\nanother identity, even another kind of physical being, behind. High-ranking aristocrats, by\ncontrast, dreamt of ghosts when they were going to fail.14\nChapter 8, p. 12 176\nBut to the super-elite, systemic rankism was not wrong. Meritocracy meant selecting the\nwisest and most virtuous to govern; and in their thinking, virtue lay in family and in learning.\nTang Confucianism\nTang Confucianism reflected that thinking. It had grown up over the centuries out of Han\nbig-clan patrilinealism and amongst some of the same families. Tang Taizong advised his heir:\n\u201cThe Way (dao \u9053) is spread through culture (wen \u6587); fame is gained through learning.\u201d This\nwas an aristocratic credo, for \u201cculture\u201d included all the practices of the great clans. \u201cThis culture\nof ours\u201d they called it, thinking of Analects 9.5.\nAn eightfold chain of narrative linked cosmic patterns (the Way) to elite culture.\n1.Humans in nature. Humans began as part of Heaven and Earth and the myriad\nliving beings of the world.\n2.Sage-kings create civilization. Then the sage-kings brought humanity out of the\nrealm of nature by creating civilization. They included Yao, Shun, and Yu; Tang the\nfounder of Shang; King Wen, the Zhou progenitor; and the Duke of Zhou. Observing the\npatterns of nature (seasons, star movement, life cycles), they translated them into stable\nguides for humanity: calendars, hierarchies, boundaries. Since all elements of the cosmos\nresonated with one another, ordering human life properly could bring order to the cosmos.\n3.Civilization in Zhou. The writing, rituals, calendars, institutions, implements,\nand arts created by the sages continued to be elaborated, creating the Six Arts of the Zhou.\n4.The Five Classics. The Six Arts, and the world of the sage-kings and their\nministers, were recorded in the Five Classics. Tang people believed that through the\nClassics we can still know what happened in Xia, Shang, and Zhou. They did not worry\nabout the histories of compilations, or whether some had been forged. They accepted the\nClassics at face value.\n5. Confucius. Confucius played a key role, for like their Han ancestors they\nthought he had written or edited the Classics. As the first teacher and a sage himself, he\nhad put the Classics in order, to record and clarify and preserve the model world of the\nsage rulers as his world declined. He preserved antiquity\n6.Decline. In the Late Zhou, people had turned away from the institutions and\npractices of the golden age of antiquity.\n7.The Break. The Qin purposely broke with antiquity by destroying feudalism.\n8.Restoring antiquity. But the Han and the Tang had \u201crestored antiquity.\u201d They\nhad restored its spirit and its outlines. Tang thinkers knew their institutions differed from\nthose of the sage-kings, because they recognized historical changes in governing. But\ntheir institutions were based on the Classics, and hence ultimately on cosmic patterns.15\nThe Tang elite thus saw their government, writing, ritual, arts, and personal behavior;\ntheir friendships rooted in mutual appreciation of virtue; and even their leisure pastimes as\nfollowing in an unbroken line of transmission from ancient times, based on the patterns of the\nChapter 8, p. 13 177\ncosmos. Elite culture and the Tang state aligned humanity with the cosmos; culture was the Way.\nCulture gave a person merit; and what meritorious persons \u2013 those with illustrious traditions of\nfamily education and achievement \u2013 did, was culture.16 Systemic rankism \u2013 the elite believed \u2013\nwas meritocracy.\nUnified Silla (668-935)\nVillagers and their Farms\nIn unifying the peninsula, Silla, too, implemented a system to tax and control farmers.\nWe have few written records of ordinary people\u2019s lives. Recent excavations have turned up a\nfew records of village people and property from Silla. These two fragments, on paper, date to\n695, according to Yoon Seon Tao, but other scholars date them to 755 or 815. Part of Yoon\u2019s\nargument for his date is that the term \u201cfirst month\u201d \u4e00\u6708 is used instead of \u201cstarting month\u201d \u521d\u6708,\na change made by Wu Zetian for her Zhou dynasty, which lasted only from 690-705.17\nThe village documents were found when conservators were repairing a thread-bound\nbook stored in Japan, in the Sh\u014ds\u014din or great storehouse of the Japanese imperial household, built\naround 756 in Nara. The Silla village documents had been re-used to cover the other book,\nwhich was a Buddhist text. 18 How do you think the Silla documents might have come to the\nJapanese court?\nFigure 8.9 Photograph of Silla village register from about 695. Even if you cannot read the characters,\ncan you figure out the different parts of the text? Heading, item, number?

Fair Use.\nThe records cover four villages and report on their holdings in a way that is unique to\nSilla, according to Yoon Seon Tae: the old official documents of mainland and Japan do not have\nthis village-centered format, although many of the items are the same as the Japanese household\nregisters and supplements (households, horses and cattle, taxable agricultural land, productive\ntrees). As you read the report, see if the math works out. What is the reporting cycle? What do\nyou think each category means (\u201chelping son,\u201d \u201cadditional daughter,\u201d etc.): what do you guess is\nthe basis for categorization and why? Does the report capture all productive resources?\nChapter 8, p. 14 178\nHere is the text describing Village B:\nThe village Sarhiji of the same district has an area of tree-covered hills that is 12,830\npaces in circumference. This includes an original area of 8,770 paces and a newly-\ncultivated area of 4,060 paces around, in Hamokchang valley. It has a total of 15\nhouseholds (\u201chearths\u201d) equaling 4\u2153 tax-quota households. These include 1 middle-\nlower household with an able-bodied man, 2 upper-lower households with an able-\nbodied man, 5 lower-middle households with an able-bodied man, and 6 lower\nhouseholds, 5 with an able-bodied man and one with 1 (later changed to 2) p\u014fpsa.\nThere is one new household that moved in during the past 3 years.\nThe total population is 125. The number of people originally here plus the number\nof new births over the past three years is 118 (117). The males are as follows: 31 (30)\nable-bodied adults, including 4 slaves; 5 helping sons; 2 additional sons, 2 small sons\nplus 3 other small sons born during the past three years; and 1 elder. The females\nare as follows: 45 able-bodied adults, including 3 slaves; 4 helping daughters; 13\nadditional daughters; 6 small daughters; 3 small daughters born in the past three\nyears; 1 exempt mother; and 1 elderly mother. There are 7 persons who moved in\nduring the past three years; they include 3 who have not formed a household (1 able-\nbodied male adult, 1 additional daughter, and 1 small daughter) and 4 who belong to\nthe sujwanae hearth (1 helping son, 1 elder, and 2 able-bodied female adults).\nThere are 18 horses, including 16 from three years ago and 2 added since then.\nThere are 12 cattle, including 11 from three years ago and 1 added since then.\nPaddies [i.e. wet rice fields] total 63 ky\u014fl, 5 pu, and 9 sok. This includes 3 ky\u014fl, and 66\npu of kwanmo paddy and 59 ky\u014fl and 98 pu of y\u014fnsuyu paddies. There are 119 ky\u014fl, 5 pu,\nand 8 sok of dry fields, all owned by village households. Hemp fields total 1 ky\u014fl.\nThere are 1,280 mulberry trees, including an original 1,091 and 189 newly planted in\nthe past three years. There are 69 pine-nut trees, including an original 59 and 10\nplanted in the past 3 years. There are 71 walnut trees, with no new walnut trees\nplanted in the past three years.\nIn the year \u016dlmi, as reported to Your Excellencies, there was one upper hearth\nhousehold that fled, made up of three persons: 1 able-bodied male adult and 2 able-\nbodied female adults. 19\nVillage A\u2019s similar description ends:\nThe total number of people who died is 9 (10): 1 able-bodied male and 3 small sons,\nincluding 1 male slave; 1 able-bodied female, 1 small daughter (1 exempt mother),\nand 3 elderly mothers. It is also reported that one kwan\u2019gap [slave?] was sold. There\nwas a decrease of 2 horses and 4 cattle, all reported as having died.\nIn this echo of the Qin information revolution, village people were categorized for taxation, and\nlabelled with terms borrowed from the Tuoba Wei via Tang: respectable commoners and base\npeople. They raised animals, grew rice and crops for cloth (mulberry and hemp), and kept nut-\ntrees to supplement their protein intake. With those trees around the houses, the village sounds\nrather lovely! But we know little about these people.\nChapter 8, p. 15 179\nAristocratic Clans\nMost written sources focus on aristocrats. However narrow the Tang superelite, Silla\u2019s\nwas yet more restricted. Silla had conquered much of the peninsula. But it never truly\nincorporated, with equal opportunities, the old aristocrats of Paekche or Kogury\u014f, or any chiefly\nfamilies from outside the core capital area with its six division.20 Real unification, according to\nsome scholars, awaited Kory\u014f times.21\nInherited ranks were called different kinds of \u201cbone\u201d and \u201chead\u201d because descent, and\nhuman quality, were understood as physical. Highest were the holy-bone (s\u014fnggol \u8056\u9aa8)\nfamilies, then true-bone, then head-ranks six, five, four, three, two and one. Aristocratic clans\ntook surnames on the mainland model: first Kim and Pak for the holy-bone clans, then surnames\ninvented or adopted for the descent groups of the six parts of the capital area.*\nMuch as US law used to forbid inter-racial marriage, Silla law strictly forbade\nintermarriage across ranks. Lovers broke the law: General Kim Yusin, who defeated Tang, had a\nholy-bone mother descended from Kaya royalty and a true-bone father; they had fallen in love at\nfirst sight and eloped. Two and a half centuries later, another former-Kaya Kim, named Kangsu,\nof head-rank six, went so far as to fall in love and elope with the daughter of a blacksmith.\nBuddhist monk W\u014fnhyo (617-686, surnamed S\u014fl) was only from head-rank six, but he married a\nwidowed princess descended from the first true-bone king, Muy\u014fl. Their son was S\u014fl Chong (c.\n660-730), the first great Korean Confucian thinker.22\nWhen couples did marry across ranks contrary to the law, or when a man took as a\nsecondary wife a woman of lower status, the children inherited the lower rank, whatever it was.\nIn Tang, the father\u2019s family determined rank, so a woman of beauty, education, or wealth could\nmarry up the social ladder, and her children would have their father\u2019s higher rank. But a lower-\nranking Silla mother would pull her children down with her. Silla was well aware of the\nmainland practice, and mendaciously identified many Kim wives and mothers of Silla kings in\nthe ninth century as Paks to avoid offending the Tang court.23 For to an even greater degree than\nin Tang and Japan at the time, rank was understood as something physical and real.\nThe holy bone families supposedly all descended from King Chij\u016dng (r. 500-514), and\nsupposedly only people descended on both sides from holy bone families could be monarchs.\nBut the holy-bone line died out with Queen Chind\u014fk (r. 647-654) just before the Tang-Silla\nalliance conquered Paekche \u2013 hardly surprising with all those close relatives marrying. As the\nNew History of Tang explained to its surprised readers, the Silla king could only marry a wife\nwho was also from \u201chis family\u201d so that \u201cdaughters of brothers, paternal and maternal aunts, and\nfemale cousins are all married as wives and spouses.\u201d 24 This Silla practice ran completely\ncounter to mainland Confucian norms, which permitted marriage with matrilineal cousins, but\nforbade marriage among people with the same surname (patrilineal cousins). Tang layered\naristocratic thinking over its Han legacy of meritocracy and patrilinealism; Silla felt more deeply\nthe pollution of mixed rank.\nThe irony is that that very valorization of blood purity in theory undermined it in practice.\nThe holy-bone died out just as the bone-rank system was being finalized. Recall that the Zhou\nformalized the ranks of duke, marquis, and earl just when the fiefs were becoming warring states.\n* Ch\u2019oe, S\u014fl, Pae, Yi, Ch\u014fng, and Son.\nChapter 8, p. 16 180\nPerhaps something similar happened here: while the holy-bone could provide an unquestioned\ntop leader the other distinctions mattered less. But with Queen Chind\u014fk\u2019s childless death, the\nrest of the Kims and other aristocrats had to establish rules for a stable succession. Some\nmanaged to snag a designation as true-bone, others were relegated to head-rank six or below.\nHead-rank six became a very mixed elite group. When Silla conquered Paekche and\nKogury\u014f, it incorporated their former royalty and aristocrats as head-rank six. Head-rank six also\nincluded the Ch\u2019oe \u5d14clan, whose members won office by studying in Tang; some Ch\u2019oe monks\nclaimed descent from the famous mainland Boling Cui clan to luster to their lowly ancestry. As\nJeon explains, \u201cThose with no surname and those outside of the bone-rank system often picked\ndesirable Chinese surnames to link their ancestry to China.\u201d25 Head-rank six, therefore, mingled\nchiefly clans from outside the capital area, the offspring of Kim and Paks who had married\nlower-ranking spouses, immigrants from the mainland, people pretending to have immigrated\nfrom the mainland, and former aristocrats of Kogury\u014f and Paekche. So much for pure blood.\nFig. 8.10. Chos\u014fn period (1392-1910) wood-block for printing map of the Silla royal tombs and a royal\npalace. How do you think the block was made and how was it used?

Used by permission.\nThis invented and mixed system required long (fabricated) pedigrees that traced different\nlineages back to royalty who supposedly wielded great power in a time when, as the\narchaeological record shows, only small chiefs existed. Fabricated stories achieved acceptance\nas a set of myths that upheld status distinctions. That minimized elite in-group violence. The\nsystem and its myths justified \u2013 at least to the elite \u2013 their domination of everyone else.\nChapter 8, p. 17 181\nFrom among the aristocracy, Silla recruited officials through different routes over time.\nIn the sixth century, elite boys were groomed for power in a group called the \u201cFlower Youths\u201d\n(Hwarang \u82b1\u90de \ud654\ub791). From 682, a National University on the Tang model educated elite boys\nin the Classics. Officials could also recommend men for office. From the 660s until almost 800,\ngood archers were selected. (True-bone aristocrats also played kickball and other sports like\nthose at the Tang court, inherited from the steppe.) From about 800, lower-elite men won\nappointment by studying in Tang. A three-level course of study formed another route into office\nfor descendants of officials; after studying for up to 9 years, they could be appointed to lower\noffices like county magistrate. Members of a few Tang clans that had immigrated to Silla won\noffice for their skill in composition and calligraphy, and were known as patrons of Buddhism.26\nBut despite the variety of recruitment channels, Kims dominated government. True-\nbone Kims held the throne and most high offices, and they recommended and hired their half-\nbrothers and cousins by head-rank six mothers for lower posts. Of 594 Silla officials named in\nChinese, Japanese, and Korean sources, almost 400 were true-bone Kims. Of the 178 Silla\nenvoys to Tang or Yamato, 79% were Kims.27 The surname was coveted even overseas; fifty-\nthree Silla immigrants to Japan in 733 requested the Japanese court to grant them the surname\nKim.28 This was a very narrow aristocratic government, drawn largely from just a few surnames.\nPoetry in Aristocratic Society\nTang and Hei\u2019an (Chapter 9) aristocrats all learned to write poetry proper to any social\noccasion: birthdays, journeys, funerals, imperial rituals (\u201coccasional poetry\u201d). Silla aristocrats\nmay have done the same, but only a few wooden tablets with poems survive. Figure 8.11 shows\nthe two sides of one: it is about six inches long, and based on dates on other tablets excavated\nfrom the same pond, it must have been written around 750-800.29 SeungJae Lee points out that\nthe tablets show no way to connect them to others. What would you conclude from that?\nFig. 8.11 Photographs and images of the front (1 & 3) and back (2 & 4) of a wooden tablet with poem\nwritten on it in ink, excavated with others from a pond in what was once Silla.

They honored the host or person being celebrated, and enabled\neveryone to show off their literary talent and make catty comments about others. It was a central\nform of entertainment and social bonding.\nLee points out that the four lines fit with no known verse-form in terms of the line length\nand rhyme. But there were many forms of verse, and the 5-7-5-7-7 syllable count of Japanese\nwaka may have developed in Silla. Lee speculates that the literary narrator of the poem (whether\nor not s/he was the actual author) was a Silla general sent to suppress a revolt: Samguk sagi\nrecords six revolts between 768 and 780. The tablet was found in an artificial pond that was\nbuilt inside the palace in the Silla capital, where banquets were often held, so Lee speculates that\nthe occasion of the poem was a banquet held to celebrate this general\u2019s victory. 30\nLee writes that lines 1 and 2 lay out the time and place, while lines 3 and 4 show how the\nspeaker is feeling (140). Lee also explains, in terms of grammar, that lines 1 and 2 are in\nClassical Chinese word order Subject-Verb-Object, while lines 3 and 4 are in Korean-language\nword order SOV.\u2020 With that in mind, try again to make the lines into a sensible English poem.\nCould the different grammars used relate to content? 31\n\u2020 This is a fundamental way linguists classify languages. English and Chinese are SVO, Japanese is SOV.\nChapter 8, p. 19 183\nLee also translated an even earlier wooden tablet, called \u201cSuksega,\u201d from a cemetery of\nPaekche royalty buried between 538 and 660. Written down around 575-600, it too has mixed\nword order. Can you turn this into a meaningful poem or piece of prose in English?\nFigure 8.13 Identification and translation of the words on a wooden tablet from a Paekche royal cemetery\ncalled the \u201cPuy\u014f Neungsan-ri Ancient Tombs.\u201d It is about a two-hour drive south of Seoul.

They have survived\nonly by the merest chance, slipping out of someone\u2019s hand and into a pond, to be covered over\nwith mud for centuries.\nBy contrast, reams and reams of Tang poetry have survived. An indispensable part of\nelite life, it was used to make social connections and celebrate public and private events, as well\nas recording emotions and observations, and serving as a medium of creativity. Elite men also\nshared poetry and music with courtesans: educated entertainers at the high end of a large\nprostitution industry centered in Chang\u2019an and Loyang. Out of a culture in which poems were an\neveryday event, a few great poets emerged: Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, Li Shangyin, and others.\nMany of the great poets also served in office \u2013 Du Fu did so during and after the An Lushan\nrebellion of 755, for instance, so he left many poems about being separated from his family,\nseeing the country torn apart, and the sufferings of others in a time of civil war. (Song men\nsometimes dreamed of Du Fu giving them the first two lines of a poem.)32\nBuddhism in Aristocratic Society\nShen Gua was right to liken Tang society to Indian society. In the Hindu system, a\nperson was born into the caste he deserved based on whether or not he had done his duty in the\nprevious life. The good or bad karma earned was carried on the soul and determined the next\nbirth. Buddha taught, in contrast, that just as everything else in the universe was temporary,\nillusory, so there was no soul either. No individual soul carried karma to the next life: rather,\nacting with intention created karma that brought into existence other, new beings, born to suffer.\nSince the same soul is not reborn, social hierarchy with its inequities \u2013 power and glory for some,\ndisgrace and hard work for others \u2013 does not embody cosmic justice for individuals. Individuals\nChapter 8, p. 20 184\nmay do as they choose; there is nothing divinely-appointed about their social roles. This teaching\nwas revolutionary in India, responding to the need of an increasingly wealthy merchant class for an\nideology that allowed them to earn respectability.\nEast Asian intellectuals made their own contributions to understanding karma. Tiantai\nBuddhism \u2013 the sort followed by the Sui founder \u2013 taught that phenomena lack an essential\nnature, but they do exist temporarily, so truth encompasses and transcends both existence and\nnon-existence, and is immanent in everything: so everything can be saved \u2013 even dust, according\nto one teacher. Huayan Buddhism taught that all phenomena arise simultaneously from\nreciprocal causation \u2013 time itself is not real. It used the parable of a Buddha image surrounded\nby ten mirrors all reflecting one another. Which causes the others to reflect first?33 These and\nother doctrinal schools appealed East Asian intellectuals, the same sorts of people who had been\nstudying the classics in depth, writing elaborate poetry, and debating the ins and outs of Daoist\nphilosophy.\nBut the teaching of no-soul is hard to accept. Furthermore, as Buddhists recognized, few\nmen and women could devote their lives to pursuing enlightenment that would bring release\nfrom rebirth forever (nirvana) by becoming monks and nuns. Since those few, the clergy,\nbenefitted all by creating no new karma, Buddhists taught that most people could improve their\nstatus upon rebirth by assisting others, especially monks and nuns. Monks and nuns formed the\n\u201cfield of merit\u201d in which laypeople could plant \u201cseeds\u201d of good karma. Some early donors were\nfrustrated to learn that their gives of money to feed and house clergy were simply piling up in\nwarehouses. They were not earning good karma when their gifts were not used, they worried.\nBuddhist monasteries began making loans, sometimes to the poor who could not pay interest, but\noften to those who could pay interest. Such loans benefitted the monasteries by bringing income;\nthe borrowers by financing their economic ventures; and the donors, whose \u201cseeds\u201d kept growing\ninto more and more merit.34 These practices travelled along with other Buddhist ideas into in\nEast Asia, where Buddhist monasteries became major financial and industrial enterprises.\nIn India, karmic law (that action must have results) operated automatically. But from at\nleast Han times, religion had already included the idea that judgement after death was carried out\nby an underworld bureaucracy that tracked good and bad deeds, and doled out punishments.35\nKarma as the idea of punishment after death re-emerged. But whereas in Hinduism it was\nstrictly individual, and in high Buddhist theory it affected beings born in the future and\nelsewhere, in East Asia karmic destiny, and especially the punishment for sin, was shared by\nliving and dead members of the whole family, in both directions: the living inherited the burden\nof sin, but their wickedness could also make ancestors suffer. The need to mitigate the damage\ndone to oneself and one\u2019s family by one\u2019s sins, even if one could not become a monk or nun and\ndevote one\u2019s whole life to spiritual pursuits, gave rise to a whole set of practices that offered\ncomfort and strengthened Buddhism in a positive feedback loop.\nEveryone could contribute to Buddhism, and Buddhism had something for everyone.\nOnce karma was re-attached to individual and familial souls, everyone could earn spiritual merit\nto aid ancestors and descendants, increase blessings in this life, and bring a better rebirth,\nperhaps in the Pure Land paradise. Laymen could earn spiritual merit not only by donating oil,\nsilk, money, grain, money, land, labor, and other things to monasteries and temples, but also by\nmaking pilgrimages to sacred sites; copying and promulgating scriptures; paying to create,\nChapter 8, p. 21 185\nclothe, or re-gild statues of buddhas and boddhisattvas; undertaking charity for people other than\nmonks and nuns, such as feeding or clothing the poor, attending to burials of abandoned corpses,\ntaking care of orphans, providing people with medicine, etc.; making contributions to the\ncommunity as a whole by building roads and bridges; road building, bridge-building; burning\nincense and offering non-meat sacrifices and prayers to Buddhist figures; releasing captive\nanimals, birds, or fish; undertaking bodily disciplines like abstaining from meat, wine, onions,\nand sex, either on particular days or in old age; meditating on the Buddhist truth, on the Lotus\nsutra, or on the name of Guanyin; chanting scriptures or chanting the name of Guanyin, or of\nAmitabha. Everyone could do these practices. Male laymen and monks, as well as women,\nembroidered images of Guanyin in Tang and Song times.36\nFig. 8.14 Reliquary in the shape of a coffin. Gilt bronze.

Public Domain.\nOn the one hand, by about 700 nearly all East Asians, from rulers to slaves participated in\nBuddhism. By 534, the Northern Wei capital of Luoyang had over 1300 Buddhist temples of\nvarious sizes: 50 built by the dynasty, 800 by aristocratic families and officials, and smaller ones\nby wealthy commoners. The wealth did not go to monks and nuns individually (about 1% of the\npopulation): they were supposed to own only a robe, begging bowl, and staff. Rather, all\ndonations and products belonged to the clergy corporately, exempt from taxation and law on\ninheritance. Corporate ownership of land and slaves \u2013 unknown in East Asia before Buddhism \u2013\nenabled the monasteries to dole out charity, build roads and bridges, make loans, and run shops,\nflour mills, and oil presses. Wealth raised their social profile and attracted yet more followers.\nChapter 8, p. 22 186\nOn the other hand, since individuals and families had the ability to earn merit that would\nimprove their lives and rebirths, those who were born into the aristocracy must deserve it. They\nreally were better than those born as commoners or mean people. \u2013 So reasoned the aristocrats of\nTang, Silla, and Hei\u2019an.\nThe Queen Mother of the West\nThe Queen Mother rode an imperial carriage of purple clouds, harnessed with\nnine-colored dappled qilin (unicorns).

On her clothing, fashioned of multicolored damask with a yellow\nbackground, the patterns and variegated colors were bright and fresh. The\nradiance of metal made a shimmering gleam. At her waist was a double-bladed\nsword for dividing phosphors, and knotted flying clouds made a great cord. On\ntop of her head was a great floriate chignon. She wore the crown of the Grand\nRealized Ones with hanging beaded strings of daybreak. She stepped forth on\nsquared-off, phoenix-patterned shoes, soled with rose-gem. Her age might have\nbeen around twenty. Her celestial appearance eclipsed and put in the shade all\nothers. Her numinous complexion was unique in the world. Truly, she was a\nRealized Numinous Being.37\nDo you remember the Queen Mother of the West from Chapter Five? She was still\npresent in Tang times, as a Daoist deity and a poetic muse. She embodied ultimate yin, the\nfemale force of the universe, and worked with other high deities to create and maintain the\ncosmos. Her devotees turned to her for aid them in transcending human limitations such as death\nand ignorance, helping them become perfected and immortal beings. There were many methods\nto reach Daoist spiritual purity, including giving up eating normal food (grain). Special\nmedicines made of mica, pine resin, and many herbs could both diminish hunger and thirst in\nfasting, and contribute to the development of special powers.38 As well as uniting in holy\nmarriage with a deity of the opposite sex, a person aiming for Daoist perfection and immortality\ncould also be tutored by a deity of the opposite sex in how to meditate and what elixirs or special\npotions to drink.\nThe Queen Mother of the West brought followers to spiritual attainments through the\nexperience of divine passion. Divine passion was the desire of deities and humans for mutual\nunion and communication, spiritual union aiming at spiritual development, but described in\nsensual terms. The Queen Mother had liaisons with sage kings, historical emperors, poets and\nmale Daoists. Tang poets wrote frequently about those meetings, but even more about her visits\nto their contemporaries and themselves, and their journeys to her beautiful, joyful paradise. The\npoems reflect their desire to find a divine teacher to show them the meaning of life, let them\nexperience perfect fulfillment, and free them from ignorance, suffering, and death.\nTang poets used the same kind of language in describing their love affairs with Daoist\npriestesses and nuns, or when courting them. They used the same language of beauty and power\nand imagination and transcendence in writing to, for, and with courtesan entertainers, whom they\ncompared to the Queen Mother\u2019s attendants. This was an imaginative space for divine love and\nlove-poetry. As one poet praised an entertainer:\nChapter 8, p. 23 187\nSounds of tubes and strings congeal; the singing she produces is so lofty.\nHow many people, in the region of the heart, conceal a wounding knife?\nI think and measure again: what would bear comparison?\nJust a single tree, newly opened, of the Queen Mother\u2019s peaches. 39\nThe Fall of Tang\nThe fall of the Tang dynasty has recently become better understood. Historians used to\nthink that aristocratic power was already on the wane as the examinations drew in new talent,\nand the clans lost touch with their estates back home. Then the An Lushan rebellion of 755\nseriously weakened Tang, allowing its generals to become warlords who brought chaos to\nsociety so that the dynasty could barely hang on. That was the narrative until recently.\nIn fact, however, the Tang dynasty survived the rebellion quite well. Yes, it lost some\ncontrol over the economy as the equal field system lapsed. Yes, the provincial courts of the\ngenerals did grow wealthy from commerce and recruit men of the lower aristocracy to work for\nthem. But rather the generals did not declare their independence of the Tang court. And their\nofficials, perhaps comparable to the head-rank six men of Silla, created a shared literati culture\nthat reinforced their connection to the imperial family.\nThrough story-telling, as literary scholar Manling Luo has argued, the lower-elite\nprovincial officials imagined themselves as loyal officials closely linked to the emperor, whom\nthey envisaged as heeding them. They began to develop less purely aristocratic values; they\nfocused on merit as demonstrated through examinations and individual virtue, rather than\nthrough lineage, taste, and deportment. They emphasized gender difference, always less salient\nwhere inherited rank thinking is strong. They used stories to both express and work out the\nstrains of their competition for office, and to imagine a cosmos that might reward them in the\nafterlife if not in this one. They created a shared belief in their collective power as scholar-\nofficials before they really held it, and valorized examination success at a time when very few\nofficials held office because of it. Luo has argued that the shared story-telling culture of these\nlower-aristocratic late-Tang provincial officials laid the groundwork for the examination culture\nof Song times.40 Social stories can cause as well as reflect change.\nSo, things worked differently after the An Lushan rebellion, but the Li family presided\nover the Tang state for another century and a half.\nTang aristocratic power, likewise, survived the rebellion. As explained above, a few\nclans provided most of the Tang high officials; because they made personnel decisions they\ncould reproduce their power, like the Kims of Silla. The super-elite clans had long held onto\npower through dense networks of intermarriage and friendship. The networks were strengthened\nby the fact that clan members all lived in the capital region, in and between Luoyang and\nChang\u2019an (a 10-day journey apart), except when posted elsewhere as officials. Within the capital\ncities, their homes clustered together. As high ministers, they married their daughters to the\nsmart young men of the capital elite, and hired their sons-in-law.\nNow, An Lushan was a member of the Tang government himself, the adopted son of the\nemperor\u2019s favorite consort. When he rebelled, An left administration intact, and did not\nmassacre aristocrats. They fled the capitals, but then they returned. Even late in the Tang period\nmore than half of the chief ministers and many lower officials still came from a small number of\nChapter 8, p. 24 188\nclans. In other words, as new evidence shows \u2013 including digital analysis of excavated epitaphs\n\u2013the super-elite were doing fine long after the An Lushan rebellion.\nIn fact, the very reason we know so much about the disruption the rebellion caused,\nhistorian Nicolas Tackett argues, is that aristocrats survived to write complaints about it. Here is\na poem by Du Fu, serving far from the capital:\nSpringtime \u2013 Gazing into the Distance \u6625 \u671b\nMy country\u2019s broken, though the hills and rivers remain. \u570b \u7834 \u5c71 \u6cb3 \u5728\nAbout the springtime city the grasses and trees grow thick.\n\u57ce \u6625 \u8349 \u6728 \u6df1\nFeeling the times, flowers, too, drop tears.\n\u611f \u6642 \u82b1 \u6ffa \u6dda\nHating to part, birds, too, have jumpy hearts.\n\u6068 \u522b \u9ce5 \u9a5a \u5fc3\nBeacon fires light, one after another, these three months. \u70fd \u706b\u9023 \u4e09 \u6708\nA letter from home! \u2013 worth a thousand gold. \u5bb6 \u66f8 \u62b5 \u842c \u91d1\nI\u2019ve scratched my white hairs even shorter \u2013 \u767d \u982d \u6414 \u66f4 \u77ed\nThe topknot soon won\u2019t hold my hairpin. \u6e3e \u6b32 \u4e0d \u52dd \u7c2a\nHaving survived this turmoil to complain about it, the Tang aristocracy dissolved very\nquickly more than a century after the An Lushan rebellion, between the 870s and 907, because of\nthe rebellion of Huang Chao (d. 884). Unlike An Lushan, Huang Chao, although educated, had\nno court ties. When his anger at the Tang regime for not recognizing him exploded into\nrebellion, Huang moved so quickly that the elite had no time to escape the capital area. Huang\nexecuted many officials, and then lost control of his troops, who sacked the two capitals and\nslaughtered officials and their families.\nTwo decades of massacres across the empire followed. Moments of peace in each place\ngave rise to impossible situations in which people had to take sides, and no-one knew where or\nwhen to escape. So many aristocrats were killed or scattered that their whole power-base \u2013 the\nnetwork of families and connections \u2013 collapsed. For the very same reason, the written record of\nthe destruction is sparse.41 Tang and its aristocracy fell together, murdered and scattered with no\ntime to write and preserve poems.\nThe Five Dynasties period (906-960) that followed Tang is often considered a time of\nviolence and tumult. But people experienced it as a welcome reestablishment of order, even\nthough there was not one central government. Commercialization accelerated, creating an\nentirely new social formation, as we will see in Chapter Ten. But first we will turn to a culture\nthat shared much with Tang, but produced its own wonderful objects and texts: Hei\u2019an Japan.\n1 Wright, The Sui Dynasty, 55-7, 80-1, 91\n2 Jeon, \u201cThe Constitution of the Ruling Elite in Middle and Late Silla,\u201d 29.\n3 Jeon, \u201cThe Constitution of the Ruling Elite in Middle and Late Silla,\u201d 42.\n4 Holcombe, A History of East Asia, 111.\n5 Adshead, T\u2019ang China, 43-4.\nChapter 8, p. 25 189\n6 Wang Zhenping, \u201cT\u2019ang Maritime Trade Administration.\u201d\n7 Olivia Milburn, \u201cFeatherwork in Early and Medieval China,\u201d564.\n8 Anthony deBlasi, personal communication, January 1 and January 20, 2022\n9 Ebrey, The aristocratic families of early Imperial China.\n10Skaff, \u201cA Slave Road?

As the mainland tradition, itself the\nproduct of long centuries of interactions among different cultures, travelled to the peninsula and\nthe archipelago, people changed it in creative ways. In the archipelago, the Hei\u2019an regime chose\nto cut itself off from the rest of East Asia as Tang power faltered, and developed a fascinating\nliterature that reveals the culture of its elite.\nHei\u2019an Government 794-1185\nFrom supporting the imperial throne, Nara\u2019s Buddhist establishment became powerful on\nits own account. A Nara monk even co-ruled with an empress who had retired, become a nun,\nbut then returned to power. Perhaps to reassert imperial independence, the court moved again,\nsettling in its final location, Hei\u2019an, today\u2019s Kyoto, in 794. From then on, emperors were men.\nLike other East Asian rulers, the emperor spent much of his time in elaborate ceremonies that\naffirmed his centrality. Unlike mainland emperors, however, Japanese emperors often abdicated\nat about age thirty. From about 750 to 850 there was energetic direct rule by emperors, including\nSh\u014dmu, the builder of T\u014ddaiji. They built Hei\u2019an, barely managing to complete the government\ncenter and northern section of the planned Tang-style grid by reusing timbers and tiles. They\npromoted temple construction and study of Buddhist works within and outside Heian to compete\nwith power of Nara temples. They fostered contacts with Silla and Tang, simplified\nadministrative procedures, and made military organization more effective, using a conscript\narmy until 792, and then hiring professional generals with their own troops. The army pushed\nthe remaining hunter/gatherer cultures further north and east, but the regime still did not hold all\nof Honshu.\nAfter 850, like most Han and Silla monarchs, the emperor often had little real power over\nthe aristocracy around him. For about two centuries, Fujiwara fathers-in-law made personnel and\npolicy decisions, governing as regents, as Han empresses had done. They made sure that they\nalways had a young son or grandson on the throne by forcing emperors to abdicate as soon as a\nson was born. Regency became so normal that eventually even adult emperors did not really rule,\nbut had Fujiwara regents. The Fujiwara did face resistance from emperors canny enough to ally\nwith nobles of other clans; the most famous such ally was Sugawara no Michizane (845 -903),\nwho was defeated and exiled. He bewailed his fate in poetry, and his angry spirit caused\ncalamities, so a shrine was established to settle him, and over time he became the patron god of\nliterature. The Fujiwara gradually lost power to abbots, warriors, and other aristocrats, but in\nparticular, from about 1050 to 1180, retired emperors dominated young emperors indirectly in\n\"An Outline History of East Asia to 1200, third edition\" by Sarah Schneewind is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.

Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d was able to reclaim imperial authority for a while by favoring\nother clans and pitting Fujiwaras against one another.\nEven as the aristocratic clans served in a bureaucracy based on Tang models, as ministers\nat the center, provincial governors in the localities, and even as local officials below them; and\neven as they became proficient in all the polite arts, and lived a life of luxury, they did not cease\ncompeting with one another. But they gave up their horses, iron weapons and armor until many\ncould not ride at all. Their competition moved to the realm of culture. Compared with other East\nAsian regimes, that court infighting shed little blood. No clan was wiped out (unlike, say, the\nrelatives of Han Empress L\u00fc), and the Yamato line was not threatened with replacement as in the\nmany coups of the mainland. Why?\nIt was not merely that there were no external military threats, because the relatively safe\nsouthern mainland dynasties had still displaced one another quickly in the period of division.\nWhat we might call a balance of weakness kept the whole aristocracy \u2013 perhaps .01% of Japan\u2019s\npopulation \u2013 in place for four or five centuries. Only from about 1185, or some say 1250, was\naristocratic power overthrown, as a new group \u2013 the samurai \u2013 rose to power and created an\nentirely different culture.2 Even then the old nobles were not slaughtered as Huang Chao\nslaughtered Tang aristocrats. They simply lost some power.\nThe Balance of Weakness in the Economy and the Fisc\nLow Productivity\nThis balance of weakness appears in the economy. Hei\u2019an experienced economic and\ndemographic stability. If we believe the historical record, right up until the eighteenth century,\nthe Japanese economy was based almost entirely on agricultural land. Certainly that was true of\nthe fisc, the state\u2019s financing. The government's most important job was to manage the\ndistribution of the products of the land to the aristocracy and their clients. Complex struggles\naround landholding appear in many documents, including the allocation of land rights, taxes and\ntax exemptions, the punishment of criminals who foraged another's crops, and military\nobligations that went with a particular plot of land. Control of land and labor was the foundation\nof wealth and of aristocratic power, and the two were related. Disease, low nutrition, and low\nproductivity kept the population from growing much. The relative shortage of labor made it\ndifficult to bring new lands under cultivation. Economic growth was limited.\nFarming technology did not improve much, either. Farmers had to turn over almost the\nentire harvest beyond what they needed for subsistence, so they had little incentive to increase\nproductivity. The educated people in society \u2013 aristocrats \u2013 lived in the capital, and were\ndescended from warriors with no experience of farming, so they did not contribute new\ntechnology, either. Nor was it imported from the mainland: the disarray of late Tang made travel\ndownright dangerous. So productivity did not rise through increased labor or land, nor through\nbetter tools, methods, or seeds.\nStagnant production levels meant that as long as the existing elite could keep hold of the\nresources they already controlled, there was no additional surplus that locally honored families,\ntravelling preachers, small-time fighters or merchants could commandeer and transmute into\nChapter 9, p. 2 192\nlocal political or military or social or cultural power. In fact, money, though coined in Nara\ntimes, fell out of use entirely in Hei\u2019an times.\nNo More Money? No Merchants?\nTo understand why, let\u2019s look first at manufactured goods, and then turn to grain. The\narchitects of the centralized, Tang-Legalist-style bureaucratic order had planned that goods like\nsalt, fish, oil, wine, wood, iron cooking pots, textiles, mats, etc. would come up to the capital in\nthe form of taxes, be stored in government warehouses, and then be both distributed as part of\nsalary to aristocrats holding office, and traded and sold in the two marketplaces of the capital.\nOther goods would be produced in the capital by artisans overseen by officials, and distributed in\nthe same way. Money would have played a small role in this system, as it did in Tang.\nBut over time, the aristocracy gained more and more control over land \u2013 as I will explain\nbelow \u2013 and the economy shifted back to a more manorial system. Each of the aristocratic clans,\nthough residing in the capital, requisitioned the goods they needed directly from their estates.\nEach clan patronized its own artisans to make what they needed (aristocrats themselves also\ndesigned and made textiles, as part of their cultural repertoire), and owned suburban manors on\nthe outskirts of town where their staff processed and stored goods for their use. Temples, too,\nheld huge estates, and managed their own production and distribution through feudal demands\nrather than through the market. Manorial control of production and distribution cut out buying\nand selling. No entrepreneurs arose to profit from trade, build up wealth, and change the\ndynamics of political power \u2013 as, for instance, Tang Gaozu\u2019s rise had been bankrolled by a\nwealthy timber merchant, the father of Empress Wu.\nBut historian Amino Yoshihiko has suggested that our whole picture of the premodern\nJapanese economy is skewed. He discovered that for the later Tokugawa period (1600-1867)\nhuge numbers of people, as one might expect in rocky, forested, islands with long coastlines \u2013\nearned their livelihoods not by growing rice but from fish, seaweed, salt, lumber, and commerce.\nBecause of the Tang model, the central laws did not include such activities. The contracts and\nother documents that did record them were not needed in the long term, and while Tokugawa\nwas recent enough that many Tokugawa contracts survived accidentally (and Amino tells the\nthrilling story of their discovery), Hei\u2019an is too far back for much accidental preservation. The\nidea that Japan was fundamentally agrarian and isolated became so deeply embedded in\nhistorical thinking that the term hyakush\u014d (\u767e\u59d3), which originally meant \u201ccommoners\u201d as\nopposed to aristocrats and then to samurai, is understood by modern Japanese speakers as\nmeaning \u201cfarmer\u201d or even \u201cpeasant.\u201d When they look back at historical documents that refer to\nhyakush\u014d, therefore, they do not even consider that it might include fisherfolk, manufacturers,\nlumbermen, and very wealthy merchants.3\nAll transmitted and nearly all preserved written sources on Hei\u2019an were created by a tiny\nelite. Perhaps they simply did not care to recognize in writing a social ferment below them.\nPerhaps coins went out of use, not because there was no international or domestic trade, but\nbecause (as occurred in the period of division and Tang) people did not trust coins. Perhaps the\nproducts of forest and sea were avidly made and traded, but escaped control by the state, which\nwas blinded by its adherence to a Tang model of taxing agriculture and not commerce. The state\nChapter 9, p. 3 193\ndid treat rice as the fundamental resource. Rice had fueled the Qin conquest, and imperial armies\nsince then. But in Hei\u2019an it came to be managed in such a way that it contributed to the balance\nof weakness.\nRights to Rice\nIn theory, the central government controlled rice through the equal field system, in which\nthe center claimed ownership of all land and its produce, to distribute and redistribute at a\ntaxpayer\u2019s death, as needed. Excavated land registers and aerial photographs of land boundaries\nshow that the equal field system was carried out, at least in less-developed western Japan (as in\nless-developed western China). But within 40 years, the state had to allow families to own land\nin perpetuity, because land without labor was of no use, and a smallpox epidemic had devasted\nthe population in the 730s. To induce people to settle down and grow grain, the state gave up the\nright to redistribute land. Still, smallholders paid taxes to the center, through the provincial\nbureaucracy. That rice was paid out as salary to officials, supported the imperial household, and\npaid for defense, rituals, and other central government functions.\nSo, initially, tax rice went into central granaries. But land and labor, over time, passed\nout of bureaucratic control. Instead, it entered a second kind of tribute arrangement, called the\nestate (sh\u014den) system. Originally, tax exemptions had rewarded farmers who planted (reclaimed)\nfields that had been wild or abandoned. But the imperial family, aristocrats above the eighth\nrank serving in office, a few other aristocratic families, and Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines\nwere also able to get their fields designated tax-exempt. The farmers on these estates paid their\nharvest as rent to the estate proprietors, rather than taxes. From the late 800s onward, farming\nfamilies began to \u201ccommend\u201d their lands to aristocrats. The proprietors entrusted management\nof their estates to stewards, called jit\u014d, who collected the rents and sent them on to the noble\nhousehold or temple in Hei\u2019an, keeping some for themselves.\nAs time went on, more and more land was held in estates, and less and less provided tax\ngrain to fund the imperial government. This looks like the situation of Eastern Han, when the\nclans stopped paying taxes and the dynasty faltered and fell, doesn\u2019t it? But it was different.\nFirst, Hei\u2019an aristocrats could not use their estates to build up local power as the Han\nclans had done, because they did not hold one big parcel of land, but many small plots of land in\ndifferent places. And second, a single owner rarely held undivided rights to the land. Instead,\nwhen farmers or low-ranking landholders, who could never hope to obtain tax exemptions on\ntheir own, commended their land to high-ranking aristocratic proprietors at court, they would cut\na deal. Each party claimed the right to a portion of income (rice or other products) from the land.\nThe rights to certain proportions of produce were known as shiki. The farmers held shiki\nentitling them to some grain, the estate stewards were also paid according to their shiki, and most\nof the harvest was assigned as a shiki to the estate\u2019s proprietor, the powerful court noble or\ntemple who held the tax exemptions. Further complicating matters, shiki, the right to a part of\nthe product of a given plot of land, were heritable; they were divisible; and they were alienable\nby sale, inheritance, or donation. So shiki, or a fraction of a shiki, could be traded or lost or won\njust like a pair of gold earrings. Many different people had rights to them produce of each small\nplot of land.\nChapter 9, p. 4 194\nThis certainly was not a clear, centrally managed bureaucratic system. Rather, it was a\nvery complex system that supported the Hei\u2019an court and aristocrats for centuries. I argue that it\nworked precisely by giving so many people at different levels a stake in it, fracturing control\nover land and labor in a balance of weakness.\nThe balance of weakness enabled farmers to maneuver better than in Eastern Han. In\nHan localities, a few big clans owned the land, hired the thugs, socialized with the county\nmagistrate, and kept juniors in line with patrilineal ideology and organization. Their power over\ntheir poor neighbors was undivided. In Hei\u2019an, because of the two systems of land-holding \u2013\ntaxes paid to the bureaucracy and rents paid to shiki holders, and because of the relative shortage\nof labor, each kind of superior, whether a sh\u014den proprietor or a provincial administrator, had to\nrestrain his demands somewhat. A truly unhappy farmer might cut a deal with another proprietor,\nand land could be shifted from one category to the other. Documents show farmers complaining\nto governors about their underlings, or working with the lower officials behind the governor\u2019s\nback. They could complain to one shiki holder about another, since all these people had to\nsomehow enforce their claims \u2013 easier to do with the cooperation of the farmers. A farmer who\nis half subject of the imperial state and half client of a court noble or a Buddhist temple in the\ncapital has a bit more leeway to maneuver.4\nFig. 9.1 Piece of silk woven cloth, Hei\u2019an, tenth century. Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nChapter 9, p. 5 195\nBut how much of that rice was actually rice? How much rice were Japanese people\neating? Wet rice agriculture had come to the archipelago from the peninsula by about 900 BC.\nIn the twentieth century, the Japanese public, influenced by folklorists, came to see paddy rice as\ncentral to Japanese identity reaching back into ancient times. But recently, historians have\nshown that Nara and Hei\u2019an farmers also carried out swidden agriculture (burning a section of\nforest or scrub and planting it with a variety of crops, relying on the ash for fertilizer), growing\nbarley, buckwheat, millet, and vegetables. Given the long coastline and mountainous forests,\nalso people collected and ate fish and seaweed, as well as fruits, nuts, tubers, and other plants\ngrowing in the forests. Despite the mythology of rice as a central crop, both in Nara and Hei\u2019an\ntexts (such as the tale of Amaterasu and Susano-o and court harvest rituals) and in later,\nespecially twentieth-century nationalist discourse, the diet of the archipelago was varied, and it is\nnot yet clear how much of the \u201ctax rice\u201d was rice, either.5\nAn Isolated Aristocracy\nJapanese nobles were few, and closely related, as in Silla \u2013 perhaps even more so. Out of\na population of about 5-6 million (estimates vary, and population may have dropped around 950),\ncourt aristocrats comprised only about 1/10th of 1%, that is about 5,000 people in all at any one\ntime. That small group dominated rank, wealth, government office, and the written record, and\nthey married only with one another. Everyone was related to everyone else, especially given the\npractice of polygyny, a strong matrilineal tradition, and plentiful love affairs. Factions shifted\nfrequently, but violence was rare. Disputes were settled by giving or taking away rank, so that\nthe bureaucratic system as a set of ranks and offices was not challenged but valued and supported.\nAbout the worst thing that could happen to a high-ranking aristocrat was that he or she would be\nexiled, which only increased the sense that ultimately, conflicts had to be settled within the court.\nAs among the true-bone elite of Silla, these 5,000 people considered themselves better\nthan everyone else by virtue of their birth. But the true-bone Kims shared a surname with\nimmigrants and lower-ranking kinfolk. The Japanese aristocracy, though it included many who\nhad originally come from the peninsula, did not care to remember that. Their sense of\nsuperiority was justified by their Shinto godly ancestry; by the Buddhist notion of karma, which\nthey took to mean that since they were living the good life they must have deserved it; and by the\nHan philosophical idea that the imperial bureaucratic order expressed and supported the order of\nthe cosmos, of heaven and earth. What was, was right; and any doubts could be funneled into a\ntoothless general view drawn from Buddhism that everything was transient.\nThe Hei\u2019an elite seem narrow, even in descriptions by scholars who love their culture.6\nMissions to the mainland bringing back books, paintings, statues, poems, music, dance, and ways\nto garden and build and govern and lay out cities slowed with the An Lushan rebellion of 755\nand ceased entirely after 894. No more Japanese monks went to study in China, as Ennin had\ndone just at the end of the Tang period; a few merchants still came to the Japanese court in\nHei\u2019an, selling books, ceramics, and textiles for gold, but no-one wanted to talk to them. Hei\u2019an\naristocrats kept reciting the poetry of Tang poet Bai Juyi, but they learned no new mainland\npoetry. They wrote their own poetry, kept diaries, and wrote novels about themselves. (The\nChapter 9, p. 6 196\nmost famous is Murasaki Shikibu\u2019s Tale of Genji, about Prince Genji and his many loves.) They\ncut themselves off from the world outside the archipelago.\nThe Good People of Hei\u2019an City\nIn fact, they tried to live entirely within Hei\u2019an city (Kyoto). Hei\u2019an was laid out in a\ngrid like the Tang capital, but whereas Chang\u2019an stimulated the economy, bringing in trade from\nas far away as Persia, Hei\u2019an ate up the wood and other resources of the country without\nstimulating prosperity in return. Roads were neglected. There were horses, and the Members of\nthe Imperial Guard could ride on horseback, even though they performed no real military\nfunction. But many other members of the aristocracy did not even know how to mount a horse.\nInstead, they travelled, both within the capital and outside, in very high ox-carts, designed more\nfor show than for comfort. A village ten miles out of the capital, in the Tale of Genji, is\nconsidered absurdly far away, practically unreachable. To go from Kyoto to the area of today\u2019s\nTokyo took several months and was very dangerous and uncomfortable. Why would one leave?\nUnder the bureaucratic system, governors and their staffs went out to administer Kyushu,\nShikoku, and the southern half of Honshu. But these were hardship posts assigned to losers in the\nfactional fighting at court. Exile from the capital the worst punishment: not only because of the\ndanger of travel, but primarily because there could be no cultured existence in such \u201cundesirable\nsurroundings,\u201d no life worth living away from the \u201cgood people.\u201d One daughter explained her\nfather\u2019s posting as governor as a result of his bad karma from a previous existence. A governor\nwould often send a member of his household as a deputy, so he could stay in the capital. The\nworst thing you could say about someone was that he or she was \u201ccountrified;\u201d one governor\u2019s\ndaughter raised near today\u2019s Tokyo wrote resignedly that the people of the capital, because \u201cI\nwas brought up in a remote part of the world\u2026 would regard me as hopelessly outlandish.\u201d Not\nonly did the nobility cut themselves off from knowledge of the rest of Asia, but they knew\nalmost nothing of Japan.\nIf the capital nobility looked down on ranked nobles posted outside the capital, you can\nimagine how they felt about farmers and workers. Because the popular Tang poet Bai Juyi had\nwritten about poor people, they were an acceptable literary subject, but still the literature of the\nHei\u2019an barely refers to such people, except in passing as incomprehensible figures who are\nhardly human \u2013 part of the mechanics of life, like carts and oxen. Working people were\ndismissed in one work as \u201cuninteresting, useless, and unintelligible.\u201d Diarist Sei Shonagon once\ndescribed some workmen she had watched eating:\nThe way that carpenters eat is really odd. When the roof of the eastern wing was\nbeing built, there were several carpenters squatting in a row and having their meal;\nI went out to have a look. The moment the food was brought, they fell on the\nsoup bowls and gulped down the contents. Then they pushed the bowls aside and\npolished off all the vegetables. I was wondering whether they were going to leave\ntheir rice; a second later there wasn\u2019t a grain left in their bowls. They all behaved\nin exactly the same way and I suppose this must be the nature of carpenters. I\nshould not call it a very charming one.\nChapter 9, p. 7 197\nThe nobility seem to have been so shut into themselves that they could not imagine that a\nworking man might be hungry at noon. Certainly the idea that such people might love their\nfamilies or suffer when someone died would not occur to the nobles. Their world was socially\nclosed in, as well as cut off from the outside, limited to \u201cgood people\u201d of the upper ranks.\nSocial Rank and Political Rank\nMoreover, the aristocracy hedged themselves about with rules, rituals, and regulations of\nmany kinds. To begin with the rules about personal and family rank: one\u2019s rank determined\nmany facets of one\u2019s life. First there was the royal family itself, calculated patrilineally. Then\nRanks 1, 2, and 3 were the \u201cHigh Court Nobles\u201d and were mainly junior branches of the royal\nfamily and descendants of those who had held clan titles before the Taika policy changes of 646,\ncarried out in the 660s. 1, 2, and 3 were subdivided into Junior and Senior. Ranks 4 & 5 (each\nsubdivided into 4) were the second layer, who still received their individual appointments from\nthe emperor personally, and who were mainly the descendants of lesser clans from the area\naround the capital in the old days, along with some who had immigrated to Japan a couple of\ncenturies earlier. Below them were Ranks 6-10 and their subdivisions, for a total of 30 ranks,\nmostly minor clans from the provinces. All these nobles shared some privileges: they were not\nrequired to do labor for the state or serve in the army. They could not be beaten if they\ncommitted a crime, and served lesser sentences than commoners. But within the nobility, these\nranks, and family tradition, and the support of matrilineal relatives and other connections,\ndetermined which official posts in the bureaucracy a man was eligible for and, since government\ngrants were the source of wealth, also determined his wealth. The top five ranks were granted\nrice land to live from \u2013 about 200 acres for Senior First Rank, who would have the job of Prime\nMinister, down to about 20 acres for Junior Fifth.\nAs across East Asia in this age of aristocracy, inherited rank and office rank set many\ndetails of life: what one could wear, in color, fabric, and style, including styles of hats and fans;\nwhat kind of carriage one could have, with how many outriders; the style and materials of one\u2019s\nhouse, down to the height of the gate post. These details were what concerned the elite, and they\nobsessively followed who held what rank and whether they were overstepping their privileges.\nThe children of the top five ranks automatically gained a place in the rank system when they\ncame of age; in the top three ranks grandchildren also automatically got rank. The other noble\nchildren must have attached themselves to the noble houses as personal servants, ladies\u2019 maids,\nand so on, for such people, too, had to be well-educated and refined.\nThe emperor could move a person up or down in rank, and you could be shifted from one\nposition to another, but all such changes were the stuff of factional struggle and extensive\nmaneuvering. Promotion depended on family connections, especially with the Fujiwara family\nwho were the mothers and fathers-in-laws of nearly all the emperors. Without high-ranking and\nactive family members, one had no chance of moving from the sixth rank into a higher rank. We\ndo read of men who took the Confucian message to heart and worked hard for the government.\nBut even more than in Tang, the interest of most of these nobility focused on the promotion of\ntheir kin and the demotion of their rivals, on marriage alliances and on the competitions in the\narts that helped to make a person\u2019s reputation and perhaps open up the way to a promotion.\nChapter 9, p. 8 198\nFig. 9.2 Figure, gilt-bronze with inscribed decoration.

Public Domain.\nElite Culture\nThe regulations of rank were only one set of rules the aristocracy had to follow. They\nwere bound by a calendar of Shinto ceremonies, and Buddhist ceremonies, each with its\nrequirements, traditions, and pleasures. Much of the energy of government went into managing\nthese rituals and ceremonies, and so it was the nobility who ran them and served as the audience\nas well. There were rules about how each had to be done and who had to do what. Moreover,\nthe nobility were bound by a number of what we would consider superstitions. There were ideas\nabout yin-yang, the alternation of opposing forces in the universe, and about fengshui or\ngeomancy, and astrology, omens, and divination which all affected how people carried out their\ndaily lives.\nChapter 9, p. 9 199\nFor the Hei\u2019an nobility, these layered beliefs evolved into an elaborate set of taboos to\navoid disaster. There were deities who moved around the points of the compass according to a\ncomplicated schedule, and when a deity was in a certain direction, you were not to travel through\nit. You might be able to take a long way around, or you might have to stay and wait until the\ntime had passed. A deity called Doku spent spring in each house\u2019s oven, summers at each gate,\nautumns in each well, and winters in each courtyard. So it would be disastrous to do repairs to\nwhatever part of the house he was in \u2013 even if the well was not working in autumn, you had to\nwait to repair it. Or you could move temporarily to another house and do a set of rituals to\n\u201cconvert\u201d the unlucky part or direction of the house into something else. Any planned\nconstruction or any celebration had to take careful account of where the various deities were and\nwhat directions were forbidden to whom when.\nBased on divinations involving the Chinese calendar, whole days were designated as\ntaboo days when one should just stay indoors and do nothing. There was a whole miscellany of\nrules to avoid trouble: fingernails could only be cut on Ox-days, toenails only on Tiger-day.\nBathing could take place only every five days and only if the fifth day was reckoned to be\nauspicious. There were other complicated rules involving avoiding \u201cpollution\u201d \u2013 contact with\ndeath or birth or other kinds of impurities.\nIn addition to these taboos, and the rules of rank, Hei\u2019an noble life was structured by the\nrules of taste. Every aspect of life was understood as an expression of beauty and good taste.\nMen and women mixed their own perfumes, dyed their own clothes, designed their own gardens,\nand wrote or performed their own music and dances, so that every aspect of life expressed your\nown sense of style and taste. Not even the content of one\u2019s poetry but one\u2019s handwriting was\nseen as expressing the essence of one\u2019s being, and everyone was always judging everyone else\non that basis. Within the elaborate and shifting codes of tradition and fashion, choosing a paper\nsprinkled with silver instead of gold for an excuse or a love-letter could be a disastrous error\ndepending on the precise circumstances. Fastening a note to a pine-branch instead of a cherry\nbranch, or writing in a style wrong for the occasion might wreck a love affair or destroy one\u2019s\nreputation for tastefulness and elegance. A slip would be discussed with disdain by everyone.\nHei\u2019an houses were open to all weather. The garden was the center of interest of a house,\nand sometimes contained expensive simulacra of places they would never travel to: one\nnobleman in the Sixth Ward had a small lake in his garden with an artificial sand-bar planted\nwith wind-warped pine trees such as one finds along the shore. The seasons were experienced\nthrough the changes in the garden, and the changing of leaves and blossoms was obsessively\nfollowed, with the pride of ownership as well as the sensitivity of the romantic.\nThe mansions were mainly one-story buildings, often in a U-shape with the garden as the\ncenter. The middle of the U was the main hall, where the master lived, and the flanking halls\nhoused his children, relatives, secondary consorts, high-ranking retainers, etc. The principal wife\nmight live with her own family, in a mansion they provided for her, or in a building facing her\nhusband\u2019s across the garden. Long verandas ran along the sides of the houses. Rooms were\nChapter 9, p. 10 200\nFig 9.3 Scene from the illustrated handscroll of Tale of Genji, c. 1130. What are the ladies doing?

Inside, each hall was one large\nspace, divided as needed into smaller rooms by screens. The rooms were practically bare, with\nthe very minimum of furniture: straw mats and cushions moved around as needed on bare\nwooden floors, a chest or shelf for storage, a charcoal brazier to provide a little warmth, and\nmovable screens. Music, chess (go), reading and writing all took place in that room, sitting on\nthe floor on the very spot, perhaps, in which one would sleep that night. A space serving long-\nterm as a bedroom there hold a raised black platform, 2 feet high and nine feet square, covered\nwith straw mats and cushions and surrounded by curtains. There were no solid walls.\nChapter 9, p. 11 201\nFig 9.4 Scenes from the illustrated handscroll of Tale of Genji, c. 1130.

Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genji_Monogatari_Emaki#/. Public Domain.\nThere was no dining room or other space where the whole family gathered. Family\nmembers lived largely isolated from one another. Brothers and sisters might grow up in the\nsame household and literally never see one another. Women in particular were not supposed to\nbe seen and talked with guests only from behind a frame with heavy curtains, called the \u201cscreen\nof state.\u201d And so the main impression nobles gained of the people of their own class outside their\nimmediate circle came from gossip, not from face-to-face communication. A noble person was\nnever unattended: ladies or gentleman in waiting were never farther away than on the other side\nChapter 9, p. 12 202\nof a screen. The lack of privacy only adds to the feeling of claustrophobia. Every action was\nobserved, every word heard, every letter read, by the people of the household.\nIn The World of the Shining Prince, Ivan Morris writes that an informed Westerner who\nwas asked to list the outstanding aspects of traditional Japan might include Noh and kabuki\ndrama, haiku poems, ukiyo-e color prints, samisen music, the tea ceremony, flower arranging,\nminiature landscapes; samurai with two swords and a \u201cBushido\u201d ethic of loyalty and sacrifice;\ngeisha courtesans; Zen Buddhism; suicide commonly permitted and even admired in the name of\nhonor or love; houses with straw matting and alcoves to display seasonal paintings; large\ncommunal baths; and a diet that included raw fish and soy sauce. Not one of these existed in the\nHei\u2019an world. All came about in the great change from the classical or antique to the medieval\nperiod, as those terms are used in Japanese history.\nWhence Came the Samurai?\nFigure 9.5 Handscroll, paint on paper, 1300-1325, fragment showing the Battle at Rokuhara (the sixth\ndistrict of Hei\u2019an/Kyoto) of 1159, from the Heiji Monogatari, \u201cTale of the Heiji.\u201d Source: Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art. Public Domain.\nIn the classical Hei\u2019an world, warriors had no place among the elite. Where did the\nsamurai come from? There is still a lot of scholarly debate about that. Court aristocrats and\nChapter 9, p. 13 203\nbureaucrats had employed professional fighters successfully throughout the Hei\u2019an period, once\nthe conscript army set up by the Taika Reforms as part of bureaucratic government had failed.\nCommanders had employed experienced fighting men on the northeastern frontier, and rulers\nhad used career soldiers for routine patrol, criminal investigations, pursuit and arrest of criminals,\nand suppression of banditry. In and around the capital, a special police agency oversaw such\norganized state violence. Aristocrats had hired experienced military men to guard sh\u014den\nproperty, punish enemies, and keep the peace. The abbots of Buddhist temples, too, developed\ntheir own guards of armed monks to protect their lands and rights.\nFor many generations, the court elite kept these warrior forces under control with a\nmixture of bribery, divided control, and ideology. Most obviously, it was not in warriors\u2019\ninterests to undermine the system that employed them. Any individual soldier who seemed\ndangerous could lose his pay, his promotions, and his rewards. No-one could build up a resource\nbase large enough to challenge the whole system, because of the balance of weakness.\nBut more importantly, the senior commanders of these soldiers identified with the royal\nhouse and the aristocracy. They accepted the values of the court aristocracy, because many of\nthem were related to it: they were junior branches of the royal household. When a line was six\ngenerations removed from the imperial main line, its members were re-classified as autonomous\nfamilies of modest court rank. They took the surnames Minamoto and Taira, and were given\nposts both at court and away in the provinces. They still thought of themselves as aristocrats,\ntheir identity relied on the system continuing as it did. They did not make trouble for the senior\nbranches of their families, still less for the emperor. They accepted the court nobility\u2019s claims\nof superiority, and thought of themselves as inferior because they were fighting men. They\nworked for the imperial bureaucratic order, not against it, even as their actual power within the\nsystem grew and grew.\nWarriors emerge clearly into the historical record when for the first time, in the early\ntwelfth century, the retired monarch hired Minamoto men as a personal bodyguard. As with all\nHei\u2019an honors, this one became a target of struggle \u2013 everyone wanted it \u2013 and when tired of the\nMinamoto quarrelling, the retired emperor selected Taira no Kiyomori instead, a man who had\nproven his valor in fighting pirates. Now armed men were in the capital, and by 1156, they were\ndrawn into factional struggles over the throne.\nFrom 1180-1185, Taira and Minamoto fought one another (not necessarily along family\nlines) in the Genpei War, until Minamoto no Yoshitsune defeated \u2013 and wiped out -- the Taira.\nMinamoto no Yoritomo, meanwhile, had built up a base at Kamakura, east of Kyoto. In return\nfor his competent service and a guarantee of income, the emperor recognized his right to govern\nall military personnel on his behalf \u2013 a kind of regency and division of power that was new, but\nnot really strange since Hei\u2019an authority had been divided in so many ways for so long. The\nKamakura \u201ctent office\u201d (bakufu) continued the Hei\u2019an warrior mission of protecting the emperor\nand the aristocracy. They did not do much fighting at all.\nChapter 9, p. 14 204\nMap R. The bakufu headquarters was in Kamakura (2) on the Kant\u014d plain, while the imperial court\nremained in Hei\u2019an/Kyoto (1) in the area called Kinai.\nWarriors or Lawyers?\nRather, the main activity of this Kamakura \u201cwarrior government\u201d \u2013 which we might liken\nto the hegemon of the Spring and Autumn period \u2013 was to create and manage a vigorous legal\nsystem. As historian Jeffrey Mass explains,\nThroughout the Kamakura period the central concern of the Bakufu was to\nbalance the interests of the traditional aristocracy in Kyoto with the interests of\nthe rising class of warriors in the provinces. The judicial system that resulted\nbecame the foundation upon which the Bakufu established its ascendency.\nChapter 9, p. 15 205\nWhen the Genpei War ended, Yoritomo needed to do three things: stop the fighting throughout\nthe islands, reward his followers even as he reigned them in, and figure out a working\nrelationship with the bureaucracy in the capital. He came up with two lasting solutions.\nFirst, Yoritomo created a dyarchy, or \u201cbipolar administration.\u201d The court continued to\nmanage the lands and taxpayers that fell under the centralized Legalist-bureaucratic system; and\nthe court and its members also continued to manage the lands and people of the estate system,\nthat is, the rice rights owed to courtiers and temples. But in order to guarantee those rights,\nKamakura put military men in charge of estates as stewards (jit\u014d). Its main business became\nmanaging those stewards, its vassals, and resolving disputes that involved them. So, the second\nmajor innovation was a \u201cvigorous judicial system.\u201d7\nInitially, while Kamakura controlled most of the Kant\u014d plain, the imperial court still\ncontrolled the Kinai and other parts of Japan. But in 1221, the emperor Go-Toba tried to\noverturn the power of Kamakura. He was soundly beaten, and the shogunate (bakufu) was\nstrengthened, so that the Kamakura vassals who had supported the bakufu were posted as\nstewards all over. They were selected as a reward for supporting the shogunate. Their job was\nto keep the peace, collect taxes, and serve in the army as needed. They checked military rivals\nand assured sufficient peace that temples, shrines, and aristocrats who cooperated could continue\nto collect income from their estates. The Kamakura stewards carried out police and judicial\nfunctions on the estates, collected the rents, and forwarded them to the owners of the various\nshiki rights. In return, they were granted shiki themselves as payment.\nA further complication is that after Yoritomo died, the shoguns themselves became\npuppets managed by the H\u014dj\u014d regents. These were Yoritomo\u2019s widow Masako and her family,\nwho held key posts in Kamakura. Since the emperor was still theoretically the top authority, this\nmeans that power was doubly removed from authority. And, there is yet a further complication.\nWhen we read the Kamakura lawsuits, they deal only with the rights to various kinds of product.\nThe Hei\u2019an-based administration dealt with a few murder and rape cases according to the central\nlaw code, but basically, regulations were set and justice was carried out at a very local level.\nHolding the right/obligation to manage disputes was in fact another kind of shiki right, and those\nrights could be divided for any given plot of land. Cultivators, a steward, and patrons at the\ncapital could all hold rights in the same sh\u014den estate (though not always) and cultivators also\nhold their own cultivation-shiki. In this network of various rights and obligations pertaining to\none estate, the laws are issued by the holder of the highest (in terms of social status) shiki, often\nreligious institutions or sometimes the imperial figures. So, a temple or imperial patron or even\nthe village itself might issue regulations or send out agents to catch a thief. If there was also a\nsteward, adjudication occurred at the bakufu level.8 Kamakura never created uniform laws.\nRather, it tried to uphold the customary practices, rights, and relationships of each area.\nKamakura presents the paradox of a warrior government that mainly operated through a\nlegal system. Not only that, but Yoritomo, his heirs and the H\u014dj\u014d regents, never tried to expand\ntheir jurisdiction or their power. Quite the contrary: in the early years a few disputes involving\nonly sh\u014den were brought to Kamakura, but the bakufu court would not hear them \u2013 it heard only\ncases that involved its own vassals serving as stewards, or their police force. Its reputation as a\nChapter 9, p. 16 206\nfair court was so good that estate proprietors who should have appealed to Kyoto sometimes\nforced their suits on the bakufu courts. Not only did Kamakura not try to extend its power into\nthe areas traditionally managed by the court, but it also minimized its interference in relations\namong its own vassals, encouraging them to work disputes out for themselves. Jeffrey Mass\npuzzles over the great inconveniences caused by the fact that the Kamakura government, when it\nappointed a steward, gave him the document proving his rights over the land, but did not keep a\ncopy. Why would a government that works by examining pieces of paper and issuing paper\ndecisions not keep copies of its own documents? But since Mass shows very clearly the\nreluctance of Kamakura to increase its jurisdiction, I think that refusing to keep the kind of paper\nrecord characteristic of a centralized, bureaucratic government makes perfect sense. Qin had\nundermined its popular support by trying to make reality match the paperwork. Kamakura\njudged cases only based on what the disputants brought forward.\nKamakura would not take complaints directed against it by its own vassals; nor would it\ntake action against anyone of its own accord; it would only adjudicate disputes between stewards\nand other vassals, or between landholders of other kinds and stewards, or complaints brought by\ncommoners against stewards. Further, if litigants called to Kamakura for a lawsuit did not come,\nthe only response of the warrior government was to call them again, and again. The military\ngovernor who served the subpoena was responsible for bringing the defendant to court, but often\nthis simply did not happen, and the worst punishment a steward faced for avoiding court was\nlosing his job. In one case, this step \u2013 a judgement against a person who was not present \u2013 was\ntaken only after seven repeated subpoenas. They never sent armed men to bring people in. This\nwarrior government was very reluctant to use force.\nProud of their military accomplishments, the Kamakura samurai saw themselves as\npreserving peace and stability in balance with the larger, very old, and divine rulership of the\nroyal family and courtiers. Mass points out the contrast with feudal Europe. There, although\nlords and vassals indeed took disputes to one court or another, the oaths and words of witnesses\noutweighed documentation, and only a royal edict had the final word. \u201cResort to the battlefield\nwas never far from the minds of litigants.\u201d By contrast, Mass writes, the Kamakura bakufu \u201chad\nall but outlawed war.\u201d If legal settlement was violated a second time, the two parties in the\ndispute return to the Kamakura court. They did not fight it out with their swords and bows.\nFor 150 years after the Taira uprising, many factors \u2013 revulsion against the violence it\nhad brought; a sense of the benefits of the complex, divided property arrangements of Hei\u2019an;\nrespect for the court with its emperor descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu; transfer of\nthis deference to the Kamakura lords; and a preference for peaceful arrangements for sharing the\nfruits of land and labor \u2013 all meant that a warrior government ruled mainly through careful legal\nprocesses based on documentary evidence.\nChapter 9, p. 17 207\nFig. 9.6 Calligraphy by Fujiwara no Yukinari.

Politically, the Song\nperiod divides into two at the year 1127, when the Jurchen Jin conquered its territory down to the\nYangzi River. Yet both Northern Song (960-1127) and Southern Song (1127-1276) oversaw a\nsouthernization of the economy and the fisc: changes in productivity and overall production that\npermanently changed politics and daily life. As Chapter Nine suggested, commerce seems to\nhave affected Japan less. So great were the changes from Tang to Song (960-1279) in the\nmainland that one historian has written, \u201cIn some ways, modern Japan is a more direct heir of the\nSui-Tang reformation than [is] modern China.\u201d1\nFrom Silla to Kory\u014f\nNew Powers in Silla\nIn the last 150 years of Silla history (about 785-935), true-bone aristocratic factions put\n20 kings on the throne as puppets. Certain noble families, to increase their leverage in the\nfactional fighting, used wealth derived from land and maritime trade to gather huge private\narmies of slaves. That armed might increasingly determined who sat on the throne: the king\nbecame the plaything of aristocrats with military power.\nIn the ninth century, the true-bone Kim and Pak clans increasingly fought one another\nand weakened the monarchy. Officialdom did become more diverse in terms of rank, as those\nwho had studied in Tang or in the National University won office. But most men of head-rank\nsix still had no chance at high office. Some simply abandoned their political careers. But others,\nalong with men with only provincial rank, even more thoroughly excluded from power, defected\nfrom Silla. They joined one of the new regional regimes that were beginning, by about 830, to\nchallenge Silla, just when regional warlords in Tang China were challenging the Tang center.\nThree kinds of regional leaders ushered in the \u201cLater Three Kingdoms period.\u201d First were\nSilla generals from high-ranking families. The first major rebellion against Silla was headed by\na true-bone Kim general angry because his father had not been selected as king. Instead of\ncontinuing the fight at court, Commander-in-Chief of Ungch\u2019\u014fn Prefecture Kim H\u014fnchong in\n822 proclaimed his own new kingdom called \u201cEverlasting Peace\u201d (Chang\u2019an, the name of the\nTang capital) and his own reign-name. Word leaked out before he was ready to fight the court,\nbecause he had contacted other provincial generals, seeking allies. But the leak did not matter.\nSome provincial generals joined him; none fought against him; some who wished to oppose him\ndeserted their posts because their subordinates would not fight him; and the central army had\nalready fallen apart from disuse and a weakening tax base. Kim also found allies among lower-\nranking officials, even those of true-bone families. The court had to request some true-bone\nfamilies to deploy their private armies to put down the rebellion, showing weakness that\nemboldened rivals. And Kim\u2019s rebellion showed that there was opposition not only to the king,\nbut to the dominance of the narrow, true-bone, capital elite.\n\"An Outline History of East Asia to 1200, third edition\" by Sarah Schneewind is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.

Faced with pirates who were\nkidnapping Silla people to sell as slaves in Tang, the Silla government authorized local leaders to\nprotect the borders and ports, only to see them build independent power bases in the garrisons\nand enrich themselves through the maritime trade they protected. One such man was Chang Pojo\n(787-846, also known as Kungbok). Chang, a lowly Silla man, had become a minor military\nofficer in Tang, and then made a fortune in international trade. The central Silla government\nauthorized him to found a garrison on Wando Island to defeat the pirates; really the court was\njust recognizing and reinforcing power he already had as a \u201cmerchant prince\u201d along the\nsouthwestern coast. Chang was the ideal man to control pirates, for they were cutting into his\nown interests in ways that he thoroughly understood. Once that was done, Chang deployed his\npower and wealth to give sanctuary to some court nobles in trouble, and then to back a candidate\nChapter 10, p. 2 210\nfor king, successfully. He won some nice titles and the great honor of wearing court dress\nappropriate only for true-bone men. But aristocratic tolerance of such a person could only go so\nfar. When Chang proposed making his daughter a secondary consort of King Muns\u014fng, the son\nof the man he had enthroned, the true-bone nobility furiously objected: \u201cHow could a daughter\nfrom an island ever be fit to marry into the royal family?\u201d Chang in his turn became angry, and\nrose in rebellion. He was assassinated in about 846.2\nThe third sort of regional leaders were the \u201ccastle lords.\u201d They came from families that,\nexcluded from court power because they had only provincial rank, built bases in their local areas.\nThey made connections with garrisons, fortified their own estates, created large armies of slaves\nand peasants, and seized grain and cloth produced by the villages. Like the rebel generals, they\nweakened and attacked Silla\u2019s power from within. The castle lords demanded food and grain\nfrom the villages around them, but the central government still wanted to collect its taxes as well.\nFarmers had to pay both the central government and from the castle lords, so many of them had\nno choice but to abandon their taxable fields, and either turn bandit or become slaves in the\nprivate armies of the castle lords and the maritime generals. Their plight was made worse by bad\nharvests in the ninth century, perhaps the result of low rainfall.3\nFamine in Silla\nLee Kidong and other historians believe that in ordinary times, the farmers of Silla were\nquite prosperous. In addition to rice land, the one excavated tax register lists farmers of different\nstrata. The wealthiest owned cattle, horses, a variety of nut-trees, and mulberry trees, as well as\none or two domestic slaves per household. But in the ninth century, the nobility and Buddhist\ntemples were expanding their estates. Just as in late Han times, smallholders lost their\nindependence to become mere tenants of big landowners. Productivity may have declined\noverall.\nMoreover, the weather had taken a bad turn, causing hunger and famine for farmers in\nTang, Silla, and perhaps Japan. That imperial storehouses and farmers\u2019 bellies were empty did\nnot stop Silla aristocrats from living the high life \u2013 at least 39 of them literally gilded their\nhouses, covering them entirely with gold. The Silla Queen Chins\u014fng made matters worse by\ndemanding rice and cloth from farmers. When, without enough to eat themselves, they refused\nher demands, the queen turned to overseas raids. One Silla sailor who was captured by Japanese\ntroops in a raid on Tsushima in 894 told the Japanese authorities that \u201cThe grain did not ripen in\nour country, the warehouses are empty, and the royal capital is feeling insecure, so the queen\nordered us to conduct raids to get grain and cloth.\u201d4\nFaced with such royal demands, farmers all over the country joined rebellions. The\nrebellions were started by the provincial elites whom true-bone families and monarchs had\npolitically exploited and marginalized for centuries, and later led also by big landowners and\nstrongmen. The dire situation had also created gangs of bandits. They started by raiding for food\nand goods, but gained in political ambition as they found no state force powerful enough to stop\nthem.\nWe have a vivid report written by Choe Chiwon, a head-rank six man who had studied\nand worked in Tang, witnessed the violent and destructive Huang Chao rebellion (874-884), and\nChapter 10, p. 3 211\nreturned to Silla. While in office in a Silla province, he reported to the Tang emperor that under\nthe \u201cfoolish\u201d rule of Queen Chins\u014fng:\nThis kingdom is experiencing a great famine. Sneak thieves have arisen\nthroughout the land. At first they behaved like greedy wolves, but now they are\nboasting of their great ambitions. In the beginning they hid like mice, coming out\nto pilfer rice chests and rifle [through] pockets, but taking advantage of the\nsituation they then swarmed like bees, seizing fortresses and raiding villages, so\nthat before long their smoke and dust filled the country, ruining the weather and\nspoiling the harvest. The thieves at Tongnung flourish even more, so that the\nfields cannot be plowed\u2026. The brigands kill people like cutting up cloth, and the\nskeletons they throw aside are piled up like a forest. What was once a gentle land\nhas become an afflicted land\u2026. All of the prefectures have become the lairs of\nbrigands, and the rivers and mountains have become battlefields. How is it that\nHeaven has visited all its disasters on Korea?5\nChoe\u2019s answer to his last question was that the bad luck of Tang had spread, as its learning and\ncivilization had spread earlier, infecting Silla.\nThe bad luck did spread, somehow. Let\u2019s look across East Asia. Parhae in Manchuria fell\nin 926. In 894, Japan stopped sending embassies to Tang. Sugawara no Michizane stopped what\nwould have been a mission in that year; he argued that it was too dangerous, with pirates taking\nor sinking so many ships, and that it was also pointless, with the Tang so greatly weakened.\n(Sugawara of course did not know Tang would collapse in 907.)6 Tang could offer Silla no more\nsupport. Silla Queen Chins\u014fng tried repeatedly to send envoys to Tang, but bandits stopped\nevery embassy on its way.\nRebels: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\nIn this increasingly violent situation, eighty years after the true-bone courtiers had had\nChang Pojo assassinated, two major rebellions against Silla took shape, and a third leader\nreunited the country. One historian has called the three leaders the good, the bad, and the ugly.7\n\u201cThe bad\u201d was a poor farmer turned soldier, Kyonhwan (867-936), who raised an army\nsufficient to sack the Silla capital in 927, kill the king and capture many high officials, and loot\nan incredible quantity of treasure. In 900, Kyonhwan founded a regime he called \u2013 to lean on the\nprestige of an earlier rival to Silla \u2013 \u201cLatter Paekche.\u201d He explicitly modelled himself on the\nHuang Chao rebellion against Tang, brutally attacking the nobility. The regime lasted until 936.\n\u201cThe ugly\u201d came from the opposite end of the social scale. He was a Silla prince. Cut out\nof the succession by factional maneuvering, Prince Kungye (d. 918) had become first a monk\nand then a commander of a Silla army garrison. At the garrison, he gathered followers,\noverthrew his superior officer, and declared an independent regime: \u201cLatter Korgury\u014f.\u201d Latter\nKogury\u014f followed more meritocratic practices than Silla, recruiting some men not of true-bone\nrank to hold high office. But Prince Kungye proved to be an utter despot who relied on terror to\nrule. Still the arrogant aristocrat, he showed little respect for the men who supported him. They\nthrew him out, and as he fled, his own subjects killed him.\nChapter 10, p. 4 212\nHis generals then chose one of their own number to succeed him: \u201cthe good.\u201d This was\nWang K\u014fn (877-943) posthumously known as T\u2019aejo. Latter Kogury\u014f was renamed Kory\u014f, and\nthis new dynasty lasted right through the Mongol domination of Eurasia, until 1392.\nWang K\u014fn was a castle lord. He was from the Kaesong region, just north of today\u2019s\nborder between north and south Korea, on the western coast. Using the profits from trade that\npassed through an island just off the coast, and with support from a nearby Silla garrison, he had\nbuilt up his family\u2019s private army. He joined Prince Kungye\u2019s Latter Korgury\u014f, won many\nbattles, and became Kungye\u2019s chief minister. With the backing of the other generals to become\nking of Kory\u014f, he proceeded to gather support for it from as many sources as possible, while\ncontinuing to conquer territory through fighting, defeating Latter Paekche. He successfully\nallied with various powerful groups, and forged a new legitimacy for himself out of the ideas of\nthe time. Then, he sponsored a new history that made Korea into a nation.8\nKory\u014f Pluralism\nHow did Wang K\u014fn create a successful new regime, twenty-five years before Song\nreunified part of the mainland? Like Sui and Tang, he drew in existing powers and organizations,\nand drew on existing ideas and beliefs, developing both the ideas and the organization further.\nFirst, Wang K\u014fn set up his capital in his home town, rather than in the old Silla capital.\nThat emphasized his status as a local magnate or castle lord, so he could gain the support of other\nsuch families. Those castle lords were proud and powerful, unwilling to give up their autonomy,\nbut Wang courted them successfully. He established marriage connections with at least twenty\nsuch families, and gave others his surname to establish fictive kin connections.\nSecond, he originally maintained friendly relations with the remnant Silla regime as he\nfought against the peasant regime of Latter Paekche. In 930 and 934 he won decisive battles\nagainst Latter Paekche, aided by an internal father-son fight. The peasant founder Kyonhwon,\nhaving earned the enmity of one of his sons and lost control to him, came over to Wang K\u014fn\u2019s\nside and helped him to defeat the movement he himself had founded. Wang K\u014fn now had the\nsupport of one of his former chief rivals, from the low end of the social scale.\nThird, he exercised restraint when in 935 Silla\u2019s last king surrendered to Wang K\u014fn. He\nincorporated the elite of Silla, rather than alienating them with bloody retribution as Kyonhwon\nhad done. Wang K\u014fn married a Silla princess, and unlike in Chang Pojo\u2019s time, the former royal\nfamily had to accept him. He treated the nobility well, making many of them officials in his new\ngovernment. He himself married and hired so many Paks that their prominence may account for\nthe appearance in the first histories of Silla (written down in Kory\u014f times), of the oldest mythical\nancestor yet, Pak Hy\u014fkk\u014fse, the founder of Silla who hatched from an egg and gave off light,\nand of many very early Silla queens (dating to before Silla people even used surnames) who said\nto have been Paks.9 So he had support from the upper end of the social scale, too.\nFourth, Wang K\u014fn was lucky in that the Parhae regime in the north, the old rival to Silla,\nwas defeated by the Khitan Liao as they expanded their power on the mainland. He took\nadvantage of his luck by welcoming the many members of Parhae\u2019s ruling class who fled\nsouthward, even giving them land to live by. The new Kory\u014f regime thus incorporated the\nindependent castle lords, the rival latter Paekche leader, the old Silla nobility, and the Parhae\nnobility. Wang welcomed elite refugees instead of making enemies of them.\nChapter 10, p. 5 213\nAnd fifth, Kory\u014f reversed Silla\u2019s style of recruitment into officialdom. Silla had\npreferred hired mainly Kims and Paks, closely related to royalty; the Kory\u014f founder worked to\navoid hiring members of his own, now royal, Wang clan, to overcome Silla\u2019s rigid hereditary\nsystem. In 958 Kory\u014f introduced a state examination system modelled on that of Tang, shifting\nin the direction of meritocracy. That meant that men of lower elite ranks would not be alienated\nas in Silla times. Compared with Silla, Kory\u014f was truly a unifying regime.\nFurthermore, like Sui and Tang in their unification efforts, Wang Kon drew on different\nways of thought. The Mandate of Heaven ideology appeared throughout the Chinese Classics\nand other imported books. In the Three Kingdoms and Silla, some ministers had used it to\ncriticize kings, according to stories recorded later, but the kings had not been interested. Their\nlegitimacy sprang instead from their illustrious ancestry, their display of honors and goods from\noverseas, their military might, and their patronage of Buddhism. Wang Kon \u2013 like the Zhou\noverthrowing social superiors of five centuries \u2013 may have been the first Korean ruler to employ\nMandate theory. He chose the reign-title \u201cHeaven-bestowed.\u201d A stele erected shortly after his\nreign contains the oldest known Korean reference to the term Heavenly Mandate. Wang also\nreferred to the Chinese classics in his edicts, and promoted their study.\nStill, Wang K\u014fn thought of himself much more as a Buddhist ruler.10 It was Buddhism to\nwhich he really felt indebted, and it became an integral part of life in Kory\u014f. Buddhist festivals\nshaped the year, temples were built everywhere, and the state sponsored Buddhist institutions,\nwhich promised in turn to protect it.\nWang K\u014fn believed in a third force: the spirits of his native land. This Korean Shinto\nincluded imported ideas about fengshui (\u201cwind and water\u201d), a spiritual technology related to\ndivination techniques that had been first applied to the siting of graves in the mainland about AD\n300. A monk, Toson, brought fengshui to Silla, combining it with other elements: the Buddhist\nidea of earning merit to improve one\u2019s lot in this life or the next; the Han theory of Five Phases\nof cosmic forces underlying political change; yin-yang theory teaching that each force would\ngive way to its opposite. The natural shapes of mountains and rivers affected the characters and\nlives of the individuals who lived there. A propitious site for a building or a tomb could channel\nthe energy of the earth and bring good fortune. Building in a bad place brought trouble; but a\nBuddhist temple or deity shrine could heal an unlucky landscape, preventing calamity.\nToson travelled over Korea divining for important locals like Wang K\u014fn\u2019s father, and\nhelping them plan construction. Each family viewed its own home territory as good, and even\nclaimed political legitimacy on these grounds. Late Silla true-bone aristocrats had competed\nwith one another by building pagodas at key spots, and Wang K\u014fn believed that Kaesong area\u2019s\ntopography had enabled him to unite the peninsula. But this localist ideology cut both ways. In\n1135, some courtiers wanted to move the capital closer to their own family power bases near\nPyongyang. Working with the conspirators, monk Myoch\u2019ong used geomantic arguments to try\nto convince the king to move the capital. When the Kaesong people won the argument,\nMyoch\u2019ong\u2019s faction turned to military rebellion, which failed. Fengshui was a powerful force in\npeople\u2019s thinking, alongside Buddhism, and the learning of the Classics and Confucianism.\nChapter 10, p. 6 214\nKory\u014f State and Social Structure\nThe new Kory\u014f regime had incorporated the independent castle lords, the rival Latter\nPaekche leader, the old Silla nobility, and the Parhae nobility. It drew on various strands of\nthought and belief for its legitimation. Nonetheless, the coalition required further work.\nFirst, Silla aristocrats absorbed into the Kory\u014f ruling class did not necessarily share the\nsame outlook as the former rebels. That difference may have led to a succession crisis in 945,\nwhen the regime was still young.11 Second, like Liu Bang, Wang K\u014fn had to recognize and\nreward those who had supported him. He left it to the third Kory\u014f ruler, King Kwangjong (r.\n949-975), to suppress the castle lords in a brutal purge; to try to free slaves to pay taxes to the\ncentral government; and to institute a civil service examination system to recruit low-ranking\nmen to staff the bureaucracy. Kwangjong tried; but no sooner was he dead than another portion\nof the old Silla aristocracy asserted itself and took control of government.\nFig. 10.2 Kory\u014f celadon vase with cranes, 1150-1200. Source: Metropolitan Museum. Public Domain.\nChapter 10, p. 7 215\nThis was the sixth head-rank educated Confucians who had chafed at true-bone\nsnobbishness. King S\u014fngjong (981-997) sponsored them, and promoted Confucianism, hoping\nto increase his own authority. S\u014fngjong set up a bureaucracy on the Sinitic model, with\nministries in the capital, and officials sent out to govern twelve provinces and about 300 counties.\nOfficials could not govern their home areas and each posting was brief, in Legalist bureaucratic\nstyle. To further prevent officials building up power bases, they sometimes had to leave a son at\nthe capital as a hostage, a method later used in Tokugawa Japan.\nKing S\u014fngjong had offered an opening to head-rank six and even provincial men, but\nthey quickly closed ranks to keep others out. To counteract that and admit lower ranks, King\nS\u014fngjong set up a Confucian academy and local schools, \u2013 but only the locally powerful could\nattend. He held civil service examinations, \u2013 but even more than in Tang, the new Kory\u014f elite\npassed or bypassed them. As in Hei\u2019an Japan, they could demand grants of tax-exempt land,\nweakening the central government\u2019s control of revenue, and they came to control the throne.\nThis meant that, once more, an aristocratic mentality prevailed: people were sorted out\ninto boxes from birth. Kory\u014f classified clans into hereditary \u201corders\u201d who specialized in serving\nas civil officials, as military officials, as clerks, and as soldiers.12 The common people included\nhereditary artisan families. Peasants were stuck in farming, often leading lives of poverty, as\nlandlords or the state took most of their grain and cloth, and demanded labor too. The children\nof slaves became slaves, who could be bought and sold. Certain hereditary professions \u2013\nbutchers, actors, and singers \u2013 were outcastes: necessary, but despised. There were occasional\nexamples of social mobility \u2013 occasional slaves who were talented, tough, and lucky enough to\nrise into the ranks of the military officers; but it was very rare.\nAll this was true of Tang and Hei\u2019an as well. But in Kory\u014f about thirty percent of the\npopulation was enslaved \u2013 much higher than the rest of East Asia at any time, and high enough\nfor some scholars to consider Korea a \u201cslave society.\u201d13 Commercialization had given Kory\u014f its\nstart, and the doors of opportunity opened wider a crack; but in Korea, the power of aristocracy\nand aristocratic thinking was not broken until the twentieth century.\nManaging the Economy: an early text from the Peninsula + Manchuria\nRecently, archaeologists in the peninsula+ have excavated 430 wooden tablets with\nwriting on them, dating from about 550 up to 1300.

Such notations may have been the origin of Japanese\nkatakana, a way of writing foreign words in Japanese that appears only after 800 or so. Lee\nconcludes that Japanese writing developed under the influence first of Paekche and then from\n660 onwards of Silla, and not just directly from Chinese texts.14\nHybrid States in Northern China and the Steppe15\nIn the tenth century, the second empire fell and various regimes divided the mainland\namong themselves until 1276, when Khubilai Khan created the third empire. Tang collapsed in\n907, and only its eastern half was reunited, after five decades, by the Song dynasty (960-12790,\nwhich drew on the long heritage of the bureaucratic state, taxing farmers as part of its fiscal base.\nBut along the northern border, several new states arose, which historian F. W. Mote calls \u201chybrid\nstates.\u201d Even more dramatically than the second empire, they combined mainland traditions of\nrule with nomadic traditions of rule, and made competing claims to the Mandate of Heaven.\nChapter 10, p. 9 217\nThree hybrid states coexisted and fought with Song: the Liao state founded by the Khitan\ntribes (907-1125), the Xi Xia state founded by the Tanguts (1038-1237), and the Jin state\nfounded by the Jurchens (1115-1234), which conquered North China in 1127. The Song court\nfled from Kaifeng to Hangzhou and regrouped as what is known as the Southern Song (1127-\n1279). In the end, a fourth hybrid state, the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1234-1367) defeated Xi Xia,\nJin, and Song and reached into Kory\u014f.\nMap V. Song and its neighbors, about 1050. The dashed line shows the rough northern and western\nborders of Song; the coast forms the eastern border. Taiwan was not settled.\nChapter 10, p. 10 218\nAll these states used a wide variety of gunpowder weapons, and their military\ncompetition over generations created an arms race, like that of Europe, in which innovations by\none were quickly adopted and surpassed by another. The first true guns \u2013 in which a bullet or\ncannonball fit the barrel so perfectly that gunpowder could eject it to accurately hit a target \u2013\nwere probably developed by the Xi Xia.\nLiao\nLiao emerged even before the collapse of Tang. Its founder, Abaoji, became khan in 901,\nbut when Tang fell six years later, he faced the challenge of holding together a nomad\nconfederation when there was no centralized government to his south to extract goods from.\nRecall that although Modun, in Han times, had overseen some farmers, he had not been able to\nstop the Xiongnu chiefs below him from raiding across the border, nor transform the\nconfederation into a more centralized form of government. Abaoji did. Treating settled farmers\nas a conquered tribe, he managed them with a bureaucratic administration called the Southern\nChancellery, while continuing to manage nomads as a tribal confederation under the Northern\nChancellery. This innovation \u2013 a hybrid administration for settled and nomadic subjects \u2013\nenabled Abaoji to overcome rebellions and to establish a somewhat more stable line of\nsuccession than was usual in steppe empires. Of course, this double administration was pricy:\nthe chiefs wanted a steady supply of goods, and officials needed salaries.\nHow could Abaoji keep the tribesmen from raiding? He did so by choosing a particular\narea of settled territory in northern China, just on the other side of a line of fortified passes \u2013\nabout where the later Great Wall would be. As dozens of warlords cycled through the thrones of\nformer northern Tang territory, Abaoji\u2019s son and successor incorporated the target territory into\nthe Southern Chancellery. This area, called \u201cthe Sixteen Prefectures,\u201d was recognized by\nNorthern Song (960-1127) as being part of Liao, in the Treaty of Chanyuan in 1005. The first\nclear border in East Asian history, the Song/Liao border ran to the south of the Sixteen\nPrefectures. It was marked most dramatically with man-made lakes and ponds (dubbed by one\nhistorian \u201cthe Great Ditch\u201d) and a new forest of fast-growing elm and willow trees (the \u201cGreen\nGreat Wall\u201d): a barrier to defend the Song capital of Kaifeng.16 Liao and Song both respected\nthe border. Peace held for decades, with diplomatic missions going back and forth, sharing\ntravel, banquets and poetic toasts.\nIn the end, however, tempted by the weakening of Liao, Song hawks finally pressed their\nclaim that without this area, the Song Mandate of Heaven was incomplete.17 In 1122, Song broke\nthe Chanyuan peace. To attack Liao, Song troops cut down the forest. A few years later, Jin\ncavalry easily crossed the once more \u201cbarren, tree-less moonscape\u201d southward to conquer\nKaifeng and end the Northern Song.18\nXi Xia\nThe Xi Xia state of the Tanguts adapted Abaoji\u2019s dual structure. The Tanguts lived\nwhere steppe met sown in the far northwest. They had been subjects of the Tibetan empire at its\nheight and were then caught between Song and Liao. In self-defense, they created a nomadic-\nstyle military force, even though many of them had long been farmers. They did so by adding to\ntheir expertise and investment ranching and state-sponsored horse-breeding to support cavalry,\nand incorporating smaller tribes along the steppe margin. As they built up their forces, they paid\ntribute to both Song and Liao.\nChapter 10, p. 11 219\nAll these efforts came to fruition in 1032 when a man named Yuanhao became ruler of\nthe Tanguts. Yuanhao had distinguished himself in the new nomadic lifestyle by leading\ncampaigns out along the oases of the Silk Road, an area that could provide rich pasture for\nraising horses. Yuanhao moved closer to a tribal model, training all young men to fight, and\ndrawing elite sons into his kesig honor guard. But at the same time he sponsored a new script to\nkeep records in Tangut. The script was loosely based on Chinese characters. In 1038, Yuanhao\nfinally declared the Xi Xia a new dynasty, and himself the emperor, with his own Mandate.\nThe hybrid Xi Xia state was strong enough to play off both Liao and Song. On the one\nhand, Liao protected Xi Xia as a counter-balance to Song; on the other, Song decided that its vast\nwealth was better deployed by paying the other two off than by trying in vain to defeat their\nimpressive cavalries. And as the Rong and the Di had done in Zhou times, the Xi Xia and Liao\nbuffered Song from more powerful military forces \u2013 for a while.\nJin\nThe Jurchens, who founded Jin, created a third variation on the hybrid state. They began\nas dispersed forest tribes in Manchuria. Some, called in the records \u201ctame\u201d Jurchens, were\nincorporated into the Liao tribal confederation; the so-called \u201cwild\u201d Jurchens were hunter-\ngatherers living in scattered villages and doing a little farming and pig-raising. They first learned\nto work iron only about 1074. At about the same time, the Liao designated one of their chiefs\n\u201cmilitary governor\u201d of all the wild tribes, providing a basis for organization. Over the next two\ngenerations, the emerging Jurchen confederation learned equestrian skills and became great\ncavalrymen.\nResenting Liao oppression, the Jurchen leadership quickly developed a centralized, army\nbased on a decimal units \u2013 easier for them since the tribes were small and weak to begin with. In\n1114-15 a leader named Aguda attacked the Liao border, took a key strategic spot, declared the\nestablishment of the Jin state, and with the support of other rebel tribes and mutinous Khitan\nforces completely took over the Liao\u2019s Northern Chancellory in 1122, recreating a tribal\nconfederation. In the Southern Chancellery, the Jin quickly gained the services of both Khitan\nand Song defectors with experience. These recent \u201cwild tribes\u201d quickly came to control a hybrid\nagricultural-nomadic state.\nAccording to a secret alliance made between Jin and Song in 1115, Song was supposed to\ncapture the Liao southern capital within the Sixteen Prefectures, while the Jin conquered the\nNorthern Chancellory, but the Song campaign had failed utterly. Liao took the area, looted it,\nand then turned it over to Song. Negotiations resumed, but when Aguda died, his brother let his\ngenerals do as they liked, and they quickly retook the Sixteen Prefectures, and then went further\nsouth. The result was that in 1127 the Song emperor surrendered the capital, Kaifeng, to Jin, and\nthe imperial family were marched off to the northwards, in humiliation and misery, through what\nwas now all Jin territory. Eager to consolidate a sole claim to the Mandate of Heaven, Jin forced\nXi Xia to acknowledge their superiority in exchange for continued independence, and pursued\nthe one Song prince who escaped Kaifeng far into central China. He escaped only by boarding a\nship and sailing down the coast, and eventually established a new capital at Hangzhou, founding\nthe Southern Song.\nChapter 10, p. 12 220\nThe Jin regime quickly decided that Song constituted no real threat. The real threat lay in\nthe newly-rising Mongol confederation. More useful than a claim to the mandate was tribute that\ncould be passed along to hold together the tribal side of the hybrid state. And the immense\nriches of the Song state were the obvious source of such tribute.\nFig. 10.3 Handscroll, ink and color on silk.

Public Domain.\nSong Economy, State, and Society (960-1276)\nDebates over the Role of the State in Northern Song\nThe Northern Song government desperately needed ever more money, both to pay\nrequired tribute to the northern hybrid regimes and to defend against them. The capital, Kaifeng,\nemployed thousands of people at a complex producing weapons, including gunpowder weapons,\nin what one historian has called \u201clarge-scale factory-style assembly line production.\u201d Sending\nbatches of 100,000 or 250,000 gunpowder-enhanced incendiary arrows to garrisons facing Liao,\nwhich \u2013 to judge by bans on private subjects trading sulfur and saltpeter \u2013 was also producing\ngunpowder weapons, cost plenty.19 The state needed money badly enough that porcelain\nreplaced bronze \u2013 which is copper money in another form \u2013 for imperial ritual vessels, in a\npermanent break with a tradition that reached back to Shang times.\nTo raise money, some officials proposed involving the state in the economy much more\ndeeply. A great debate arose, about state ideology and organization. All took for granted the\nbasic Legalist bureaucratic state. But within that, Song officials framed a moral and pragmatic\nChapter 10, p. 13 221\nchoice between an ideal of a small, lightly-funded government, and an ideal of a government\nactively wielding power to construct a better society, caring for the people and defending the\nrealm. Representatives of the two sides are historian Sima Guang, who believed in small\ngovernment and on choosing intrinsically virtuous men to serve in office, and classicist Wang\nAnshi, who attempted major institutional reforms so that government could tackle big problems\nwith expertise.\nSima Guang (1019-1086) and others argued that government should be small and cheap.\nLow taxes would free people to grow and make, buy and sell profitably. That meant giving up\non the huge army needed to retake the Sixteen Prefectures. But Sima was satisfied with a balance\nof power between Song and Liao. More generally, Sima admitted that existing institutions had\nflaws, but thought that the process of radical change would in itself destabilize society and\nendanger everyone. This is a classic conservative position.\nAs a historian, Sima Guang regarded the state not as a natural or cosmic product, but as a\n(metaphorical) building constructed by the founder of each successive dynasty. Having earned\nthe Mandate of Heaven by outsmarting and outlasting his rivals, the new emperor built a state\nwith the people as its foundation; rules and rituals its supporting columns; the high ministers its\nroof beams; the rest of officialdom its roof; the generals its walls; and the soldiers its gate. His\nsuccessors should maintain the building \u2013 they were caretakers, not owners \u2013 by training\nsoldiers, storing grain, selecting honest officials, and keeping administration going. Just like a\nbuilding, the state could stand if only every part carried out its function faithfully, while the\ncaretaker watched for rotten beams or loose bricks. With proper management, a dynasty might\nlast, he thought, a thousand years.\nWang Anshi (1021-1086), by contrast, relied less on history than on the Classics. Like\nWang Mang of Han times, he drew on the Classics to envision fundamental changes to the\nlaissez-faire approach to the economy that was increasing the wealth gap and impoverishing\nmany farmers. He saw the metaphorical building of the Song state as already rotting. Big parts\nof it should be torn down and built anew, even if that meant sleeping outside while the\nreconstruction was going on. In the destruction and rebuilding, different parts of the state just\nmight not work for a while, and the architect \u2013 Wang himself, of course \u2013 had to be able to call\nthe shots. The self-interested elite who staffed the bureaucracy would object, but Wang knew he\nwas right: the classics, he said, backed him up. The short-sighted common people might balk,\nbut they would eventually see that the changes benefitted them.\nLike other revolutionaries, Wang believed that one integrated system should incorporate\neveryone and link everything to the state. He disliked variation and dissent in thought. When in\npower, Wang did not hesitate to demote and exile those who disagreed with him, and promote\nyoungsters who did support him. He imposed his interpretation of the classics on the\nexamination curriculum for all. Sima, on the other hand, thought that the state should stay out of\nprivate commerce, and likewise, that as long as a man in office worked as honestly and\nthoroughly as he could, it was none of the state\u2019s business what he thought: there was a private\nsphere of autonomy. \u2013 People still argue today about just such issues.\nWhen Emperor Shenzong (r. 1068-86) took the throne, he was only 20: a fiery young\nnationalist determined to re-take the Sixteen Prefectures from Liao. He appointed Wang Anshi\nPrime Minister, and supported a series of reforms called the New Policies, from 1069-1076.\nChapter 10, p. 14 222\nShenzong chose Wang because he offered ways to enrich the state and strengthen defense, such\nas organizing special horse-raising zones along the northern frontier, new weapons manufacture,\nand ways to train militia members. But Wang was no hawk; he worried about state control and\ndomestic inequalities in wealth. Alongside old Legalist approaches like remeasuring land to\nmake taxes fair, and organizing households into groups for mutual surveillance, the New Policies\nincluded pro-trade moves, like legalizing the international trade through Quanzhou (see below).20\nOne New Policy, the \u201cGreen Sprouts\u201d program, tried to assure the long-term fiscal\nstrength of the state by helping farmers.21 Farmers had been borrowing seed grain for planting in\nspring, at exorbitant rates of interest, from wealthy landlords, merchants, or Buddhist temples.\nThat led to a spiraling cycle of debt, so that small farmers lost land to their wealthier neighbors,\nwho were better able to evade taxes because of their wealth, connections, and influence. The\nfiscal base of the state eroded as fewer taxes were paid. (Sound familiar?) Instead, the state lent\nfarmers the seed they needed, allowing them to pay it back to state granaries when the harvest\ncame. The state charged a below-market interest rate: only 20% plus fees over six months.\nThis was not intrinsically a bad idea. Even Sima Guang wrote after Wang\u2019s death that\n\u201cthe great idea of this measure was in the interests of the people.\u201d22 And poet and scholar-\nofficial Su Shi, although at first he strongly opposed the project, after thirteen years of seeing it\nin action wrote that Wang Anshi\u2019s idea \u201ccould not be improved upon, even by a sage.\u201d23 The\ntrouble was that officials in the counties and prefectures abused the policy: to fulfill required\nquotas of loans, or to fill their pockets, they forced unnecessary loans on farmers and even\nurbanites. This aroused great resentment, of course. Sima Guang and the anti-Wang party\nthought that empowering government would always lead to such corruption; even the best idea,\nif imposed by the center, would have bad results. They preferred to let the market work\naccording to laws of supply and demand.\nThe New Policies also took the blame for a terrible drought in North China in 1074 that\nforced many poor farmers to abandon their land. The situation appeared to have been worsened\nby their Green Sprouts loans. Someone wrote a very moving memorial describing the suffering\nof these families, and the Empress Dowager and some eunuchs who opposed Wang Anshi took\nadvantage of the famine to criticize him. Wang felt he had lost face, and retired, with honors, to\nNanjing.24 Thereafter, the two sides cycled in and out of power like Democrats and Republicans,\nuntil 1127, when Kaifeng fell and Song abandoned the north.\nA Less-Active Central State in Southern Song\nThe dynasty and government regrouped in Hangzhou, which grew to house between one\nmillion and two-and-a-half million people: a city that awed Italian traveler Marco Polo and\nMoroccan traveler Ibn Battuta. Under the Southern Song, the government retreated somewhat.\nFar from implementing a coordinated nationwide institutional program like the New Policies, it\naccepted that government \u2013 even legal precedents in settling lawsuits \u2013 would vary across the\ncountry. The Southern Song government echoed some Northern Song ventures, but in ways that\ndeliberately shifted control downwards, tried but failed to control things, or just stopped doing\nthings and let the private sector fill in if it would.\nFor instance, Northern Song had operated a direct monopoly in salt and tea. Southern\nSong sold licenses to merchants to buy and sell those goods instead. Instead of giving monks\nChapter 10, p. 15 223\nand nuns examinations to limit their numbers, the Southern Song state issued a limited number of\nordination certificates in exchange for cash; since they permitted a tax-exemption these\ncertificates came to be used as a form of highly-desirable paper money. Instead of magistrates\nand prefects preparing maps of local property boundaries for tax purposes, the state asked large\nlandowners to do it themselves. Newspapers came to be issued by private printers, as well as the\nstate. People facing prosecution at law could hire private legal advocates. There were private\nmilitias for local defense, and local communities determined where jurisdictional boundaries fell.\nExtensive state printing ventures were abandoned, but private printers picked up their model of\nissuing cheap editions. State schools for courtesans to entertain at official banquets were closed;\nentertainers were hired instead. Other ways Northern Song set a model for private and local\naction in the Southern Song appear below.\nMore Rice, More People\nThe Song state presided over a large population. Shang and Zhou had arisen in the north,\nand the taxing of southern people had progressed slowly over time. South of the Yangzi, the first\nempire, Qin-Han, had tried to control only the river valleys. The post-Han Jiankang empire\npresided over less than a quarter of the population of former Han territory. The southeastern\ncoastal province of Fujian, where Quanzhou is, fell under taxing regimes last, because of the\nmountains that surround it. The Tang writer Han Yu described it this way:\nTyphoons for winds, crocodiles for fish \u2013\nAfflictions and misfortunes not to be understood!\nSouth of the country, as you approach its boundary,\nThere are swollen seas linked to the sky.\nPoisonous fogs and malarial miasmas\nDay and evening flare and foam.25\nTraders skipped Fujian, and went south to Guangzhou or further north to Yangzhou instead. But\na post-Tang autonomous regime developed Quanzhou as a port, and under Song control, it\ncontinued to grow. By about 1000, it housed communities of Muslims (Quanzhou\u2019s first mosque\nwas built in 1009) and Hindus. Hindus put up a Shiva lingam, and inscribed stones in Tamil.\nHindu gods including Shiva and Vishnu appear in a Buddhist temple there, as does the Monkey\nKing Sun Wukung (hero of Journey to the West): looking just like the monkey-god Hanuman.\nThe foreigners who settled in Quanzhou, bringing their languages and religions, also\nbrought new strains of rice \u2013 drought-tolerant and disease-resistant \u2013 which spread the habit of\neating rice.26 The south was rice country, and sixty percent of Song taxpayers lived there.\nPopulation not only shifted south, but also grew. In the year 2, the population of China\nwas about 60 million people, dropping to 49 million in the Latter Han. The census in the year\n755 counted about 52 million people, so real population was probably still around 60 million \u2013\nabout the same as eight centuries earlier. By 980, however, Northern Song presided over 100\nmillion people, even without the far west. The number of registered households tripled from 980\nto 1110, while registered fields only doubled.27\nHow could two times the land support three times the population? The answer is that wet\nrice agriculture, especially with intensive labor inputs such as transplanting seedlings and\nChapter 10, p. 16 224\nfrequent weeding, feeds more people than wheat or millet. Jiankang people had built dikes and\ntransformed the swamps of the south into fields that could be flooded and drained at the\nappropriate times for plowing, planting, transplanting, weeding, and harvesting. This work\ncontinued, and by Song times rice production had soared.\nMap W: Rough borders of the Southern Song (dashed) and Jin (dotted) territories, after 1127; some of\ntheir neighbors; and cities mentioned in the text. Q = Quanzhou. G= Guangzhou (Canton).\nChapter 10, p. 17 225\nRice produces more food per acre than any other grain: even today wheat yields only half\nas much per acre as rice, and the gap between medieval European wheat crops and Song rice\ncrops was much greater.28 Unlike other plants, rice can breathe under water, and the water\nregulates temperature, controls weeds, dissolves nitrogen and inorganic salts so that they are\neasier for the rice to absorb. So, fields do not need to lie fallow for a season to rebuild nutrients;\nin fact, the longer rice is grown in one place the more nutritious the soil gets, because the water\nand roots pull minerals up from far below.29 The southern mainland has more water than the\nnorth. The growing season is longer.\nSoutheast Asian farmers had developed new strains of rice with a shorter time to harvest,\nso two crops per year could be grown, and Song farmers continued their work, developing new\nvarieties that were more resistant to disease, or had other strengths. New kinds of seed passed\nfrom farmer to farmer, and were distributed by the government. Scholar-official Zhu Xi (1130-\n1200), a key figure in Confucian thought, wrote in a letter about Xinchang county in Zhejiang:\nThis county, too, has had a severe drought. The early rice harvest was entirely lost.\nThe fields of intermediate and late rice had already become cracked and parched\nwhen, in the middle of the 7th month, it rained for several days in a row. As a\nresult, it has been possible to have water in all the fields; and there is hope that\nthere will be a harvest of the intermediate and late rice.30\nThere were fewer years of dearth, and more people ate rice than ever before.\nCommercialization\nSince rice requires a lot of tending to reach its highest potential, and the growing season\nis longer in the warm South, people worked more. As a big landlord in the Yangzi delta wrote:\nBefore the new year, wheat is sown.\nWhen the wheat has risen, we plant the sprouts of rice.\nWhen the latest-ripening rice is done,\nThe winter vegetables are already green.\nAfter the harvest, there are no idle hands,\nNo empty acres in the diked fields.\nMy family\u2019s hundred tenants have learned\nWhat it is to reap in every season.31\nBut even with the year-round work, the rice economy freed up labor; fewer people had to be\nengaged in producing basic necessities.\nAt the end of the Tang period, most cultivators were still largely self-sufficient in food\nand clothing, buying only government salt and iron tools. The Green Sprouts program may have\npushed commercialization forward in that it monetized farmers\u2019 debts, or the process may have\nbeen a more \u201cnatural\u201d response to surplus production. By mid-Song, although some farming\nhouseholds were still self-sufficient, and others had fallen into tenancy on large estates, many\nhad become specialists. They grew one main crop to sell on the free market \u2013 tea, sugar, indigo,\nmulberry \u2013 and using the money to buy grain and cloth and pay their taxes. That meant that\nChapter 10, p. 18 226\nchanges in prices far away affected farmers. They learned to calculate possible profit based on\ncomplex factors, and big losses were as possible as big gains.\nAlong with the high productivity of rice, the many waterways of the south contributed to\nthe commercial revolution. Boats of every size and description plied the rivers, streams, lakes,\ncanals, and coastline, carrying goods to be sold as far away as the Middle East or as close as the\nnext town. Whole families lived on boats and lived by transporting people and goods. Water\ntransport costs less than cartage by road, so merchants could make profits by selling cheap bulk\ngoods like grain, vegetable oil, and ordinary cloth. Farmers produced for the market and became\nconsumers, purchasing the \u201cseven indispensable items:\u201d tea, rice, salt, soy sauce, cooking oil,\nvinegar, and charcoal or firewood. One observer saw farmers carrying rice into Southern Song\nHangzhou, and going home with the seven goods and with incense, candles, noodles, spirit-\nmoney, flour, pepper, ginger, and medicine.32\nTrade revolutionized life in the south: Fujian, for instance, transformed from a\nsubsistence hemp and rice economy to one that specialized in fruits like oranges and lichees;\nsugarcane; manufactured goods including pottery and metalware; and cotton, introduced through\nSoutheast Asia from the Middle East.33 Counties and prefectures specialized in different\nconsumer goods: Suzhou was known for lacquer as well as rice; Yuezhou for porcelain; Ningbo\nfor copperware; Quanzhou for combs, and cotton.34 Tang long-distance trade had focused on\nluxury items; now it was the mass market in staples and moderately-priced consumer goods that\ndrove long-distance waterborne commerce. Not only Quanzhou, mentioned above, but also the\nSouthern Song capital Hangzhou, Guangzhou (Canton), and Hainan Island all hosted\ncommunities of foreign merchants. Alongside Chinese merchants, they traded peacefully with\nports in today\u2019s Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and India.\nA whole human infrastructure of trade arose: from peddlers who carried a couple of\nbaskets of shoes on a ten-day circuit of villages, up to merchants whose capital amounted to\nseveral large seagoing boats, and who invited investors to partner in one voyage or many. From\nvillage shopkeepers selling a few needles and pots from the front of a house, up to town shop-\nowners specializing in gold-speckled folding fans from Japan. From brokers who hired ships\nand crews on behalf of rice merchants and the state, to salt merchants who held state licenses and\nlived in unimaginable wealth. Innkeepers, porters, muleteers, boatmen of all kinds \u2013 thieves and\nrascals \u2013 goldsmiths, pawnbrokers, moneychangers, moneylenders \u2013 smugglers and officials on\nthe take: every kind of living that could be made from commerce appeared in Song times.\nTravellers worried settled families, as this anecdote, told as true, suggests:\nThe Li household of Anqing prefecture had a servant named Hu Baiwu, who had\ndied several years ago. One day, setting off for the capital, Li saw someone in the\nstreet resembling him, at which he exclaimed and questioned the seller. He said:\n\u201cYour humble is servant is actually a ghost; not originally fated to die yet, my\nethereal soul could not submit to authority, and has no option but to drift through\nthe mortal world.\u201d Questioned about the things he sold, he said: \u201cThese are items\nfrom this (mortal) world; every day I bring the travelling peddler\u2019s stall, and the\nmoney I use is also of this world.\u201d Questioned as to his accommodation, he said:\n\u201cAt night I rest at the roadside, on a butcher\u2019s board, where the guards on patrol\ndon\u2019t see me; those trading like this are very many, and are of course ghosts.\u201d It\nChapter 10, p. 19 227\ncan therefore be seen that mixed among the floating population are ghostly people;\neven grasping their fingers and pointing, none would see this truly.35\nYet trade and travel also spelled romance. Portraying the arrival in port of a long-distance\nboat arriving with goods, poet Lu Yu contrasted \u201cThe Merchant\u2019s Joy\u201d with the dull life of a\nscholarly failure.\nThe wide wide Yangtze, dragons in deep pools;\nwave blossoms, purest white, leap to the sky.\nThe great ship, tall -towered, far off no bigger than a bean;\nmy wondering eyes have not come to rest when it\u2019s here before me.\nMat sails: clouds that hang beyond the embankment;\nlines and hawsers: their thunder echoes from high town walls.\nRumble rumble of oxcarts to haul the priceless cargo;\nheaps, hordes to dazzle the market \u2013 men race with the news.\nIn singing-girl towers to play at dice, a million on one throw;\nin flag-flown pavilions calling for wine, ten thousand a cask.\nThe mayor? The governor? We don\u2019t even know their names:\nWhat\u2019s it to us who wields power in the palace?\nConfucian scholar, hard up, dreaming of one square meal;\na limp, a stumble, prayers for pity at His Excellency\u2019s gate;\nteeth rot, hair falls out, no-one looks your way;\nbelly crammed with classical texts, body lean with care \u2013\nSee what Heaven gives me \u2013 luck as thin as paper!\nNow I know that merchants are the happiest of men.36\nTo recap: Rice produced a surplus, which released labor from subsistence work into the\nproduction of goods for sale. Commerce increased, especially in the south where cheap water\ntransport was readily available.\nTrade then promoted urbanization. Tang towns had been administrative centers; only the\ncapitals had a richer social life recorded in the sources. As the population grew and more shops\nand markets were needed to handle trade, the once-every-ten-days market serving nearby\nvillages became towns, and towns became cities with markets open every day, as well as\npermanent shops. By late Song, about 12% of the population may have lived in cities. They did\nnot grow food, but lived by providing services and consumer goods. In thirteenth-century\nHangzhou, artisans and merchants organized themselves into 414 different guilds (hang \u884c).37\nThe whole city of Jingdezhen focused on its pottery kilns; for true porcelain, with its lustrous\nsheen and unmatched smoothness and hardness, was invented in Song times, and outpaced silk\nas an export product. Sugar mills employed a dozen workers and ran on ox-power, selling the\njugs of cane juice to candy-makers. 38 City work had no off-season; people worked all year, all\nday, and into the night. So production and productivity rose again.\nIron production soared. In 1078, the Song national output of iron was about 125,000 tons\nper year, six times what was produced in 806. That\u2019s about 3 pounds of iron per person: a rate of\nChapter 10, p. 20 228\nproduction Europe achieved only in 1700. Much of the iron went to the Northern Song capital,\nKaifeng, with a population of nearly one million. Thousands of iron workers turned it into\nweapons, tools, nails, locks, and musical instruments. Huge smelters used up the available wood\nby 1100, so the industry turned to burning coke (made by anaerobically heating coal). The iron\nindustry hired farmers in the agricultural slack season, and poets pitied families in areas where\nsuch employment was not available.39\nTrees fell to feed commerce and industry, and human lifeways changed. Gunpowder\nweapons set the world on a new course that could not have been imagined. And the state\nchanged as well.\nRecruitment for Office\nThe Song founder patiently conquered the warlords of the post-Tang period, giving them\nplenty of time to surrender, and set up a state structure that subordinated military power to civil\npower. Han and Tang consort families had frequently intervened in government, and in later\nperiods eunuchs and imperial favorites sometimes dominated the court. But Song bureaucrats\nand emperors really did wield power. Their reform programs were not like the futile cries of the\nHan Confucians. They defined themselves by their talent, virtue (our old friend de), and service\nto the dynasty and the people. And they took full account of the commercial economy.\nSong officials were self-consciously Confucian, even though they sometimes disagreed\nabout what that meant. However they came to office, they came to high office because they\nwere unusually articulate, thoughtful, or savvy. These men had multiple talents. Most of them\nled troops in battle against foes or rebels, as well as taking on all the practical matters of\ngovernment: building infrastructure, settling lawsuits, dealing with poor harvests and disasters,\ncollecting taxes, and solving murder cases \u2013 from 1247 with the aid of the world\u2019s first manual\nof forensic medicine, The Washing Away of Wrongs. They wrote policy memorials to the\nemperor, reams of poetry, epitaphs for friends, and ruminations on the places they travelled\nthrough. They sponsored Buddhist and Daoist institutions and studied those traditions. They\npainted and did calligraphy and played music, and managed large estates and affairs in their own\ncommunities. (When they were away, their wives cared for their parents, managed the estates,\nand educated the children.) They improved technology, investigated natural phenomena, and\nstudied history from primary and secondary sources. Multi-taskers extraordinaire, these men.\nSong officials came from a larger number of families than in Tang. As a cohesive social\nnetwork, Tang aristocrats were gone for good in the mainland, slaughtered and scattered by\nHuang Chao. Moreover, a key technological advance made it possible to educate and recruit\nfrom a wider swath of the male population. That was printing. Woodblock printing on paper\nhad been invented under Empress Wu, but it was used only for Buddhist scriptures and prayers,\nand images of gods, and after Empress Wu\u2019s reign printing was replaced again by large\nworkshops where people copied texts out by hand (\u201cmanuscripts\u201d). The Northern Song state,\nhowever, printed daily gazettes of court news, the imperial calendar, and huge numbers of books:\nthe imperial calendar, Classics, histories, encyclopedias, books on math & astronomy, Daoist and\noccult texts, and especially medical texts as they tried to supplant shamans. The state printed\neditions replaced manuscripts and became the standard editions for the civil service examinations.\nIt quickly became evident that demand for such books was vast, so in the eleventh century\n(1000s), commercial printers arose. They issued pirated state newspapers and cheaper versions\nChapter 10, p. 21 229\nof the standard texts, along with rhyming dictionaries, tiny versions of the texts to facilitate\ncheating, model exam essays, and so on. Families, temples, and for-profit printers offered\nBuddhist and Daoist scriptures and miracle tales, posters, political pamphlets, collected works by\nliterati men, and tales of the strange. One write, Hong Mai, collected anecdotes of strange tales\n(told as true, though we might not believe them) and printed one collection; so many readers\nwrote him with their own contributions that he issued sequels.\nIn short, woodblock technology quickly surpassed manuscript production, printing\nescaped state control, and texts were so widely available that many more people could learn to\nread and could study, for the examinations or for business or religious purposes.40\nState schools recruited students from among the common people, and unlike in Tang\ntimes the examinations were graded anonymously. There were three levels of exam, held on a\nthree-year cycle that was observed, with some breaks, until 1905. Exam candidates chose to\nspecialize in Confucian classics, or historical texts, or ritual texts or the law. Entering office\nthrough examination was the most prestigious route into office, but there were others. Each high\nofficial could recommend one son (the \u201cshadow\u201d privilege); government clerks could be\npromoted; provincial officials could recommend candidates; graduates of the National University\nwere eligible to hold office; military men could transfer to the civil side; lower-level degrees\ncould be purchased; and there were special \u201cfacilitated\u201d exams for men who had repeatedly\nfailed.\nThe civil service exams of Northern Song created a new elite that defined itself by exam\nculture, and created an interest group of students, even those who would never pass, which made\nit hard to change the examinations again. Once that new elite held power, of course, its members\ntook steps to assure their own continued status: even as more and more men took examinations,\nthe percentage of officials who held regular examination degrees dropped, from 89% in 1046 to\n54% in 1213.41 Many of those who passed examinations had maternal or paternal relations who\nhad also passed, so the opportunities for \u201cnew men\u201d narrowed over time. But unlike in Tang\ntimes, families had to keep taking examinations, if not serving in office, to retain their social\nstatus: it was not hereditary. Studying for and taking exams became the defining characteristic\nof the new elite, the gentry.\nA New Elite: The Gentry Class\nParticipation in the civil service examinations defined the gentry class. It was truly a\nclass, for its power rested on wealth, not inherited rank or bloodline. But wealth had to be\nfunneled into education sufficient for a son to pass an examination every generation or two, or\nthe family would lose the legal privileges associated with holding a degree or holding office, and\nbecome commoners again. The gentry class, though composed of different families over time,\ndominated mainland society until the dynastic system fell in 1911. Tang society had an many-\nstepped grading of rank and social status, from the \u201cpurest blood\u201d super-elite families with their\nfamily traditions down to lower aristocrats, to commoners and mean people and slaves. From\nSong through Qing, setting aside the imperial family, society basically divided into gentry\n(sometimes called literati) and everyone else. Gentry families might be relatively poor, as Mei\nYaochen\u2019s \u201cSad Remembrance\u201d of his wife, from a richer gentry family, suggests:\nFrom the time you came into my house\nChapter 10, p. 22 230\nyou never seemed to mind being poor,\nevery evening sewing till midnight,\nlunch ready a little past noon.\nOut of ten days, nine we ate pickles;\none day \u2013 a wonder \u2013 we dined on dried meat.\nEast and west for eighteen years,\nthe two of us sharing bitter and sweet,\ncounting all along on a hundred-years\u2019 love \u2013\nwho\u2019d have thought you\u2019d be gone in one night?\nI still remember when the end came,\nhow you held my hand, not able to speak \u2013\nthis body, though it lives on,\nat the last will join you in dust.42\nIndividual gentrymen held different ranks and amounts of wealth and they might never serve in\noffice, or might do so briefly. But a gentry family was defined by a constellation of activities,\nrather than inherited rank.\nGentry families had enough land and money to support high-status activities. They\nstudied. They owned, borrowed, read, and wrote books, performed Confucian family rituals, took\nthe examinations and aspired to hold office, married other gentry families, and visited high\nofficials and other powerful people. They sponsored Buddhist and Daoist clergy and temples,\nbut they identified with the Confucian tradition of scholarship and public service. A family that\nbecame rich in the commercial economy could acquire gentry attributes could be acquired over a\ncouple of generations, as Tang aristocratic rank could not, by study and by marrying into gentry\nfamilies. So in the Song, and even more in the Ming and Qing, gentry families were involved in\ntrade and money-lending and even production, as well as agriculture, and mercantile families or\nwell-to-to farmers could buy books, hire teachers, educate their sons to pass the exams and take\noffice, and slowly acquire the cultural polish necessary to be \u201cgentry.\u201d It is because gentry status\nrequired some wealth, not a long pedigree, that they are a \u201cclass.\u201d\nSong was not an egalitarian society. Office-holding was still the most prestigious and\nwell-paid occupation. Educated men even remade the ideal of filial piety: they argued that\nearning state honors and privileges was the most filial of acts, more important than the daily,\npersonal service to parents they could not do while travelling and serving far from home.43\nOfficials could earn personal as well as office rank, and gentry imagined themselves physically\ncomposed of finer qi than others.\nGentrymen who did not pass exams entered various occupations. Yuan Cai advised that\nthe smartest gentry sons study for the exams, the next smartest become teachers, and others work\nas clerks, doctors, Buddhist monks, Daoist priests, diviners, astrologers, and physiognomists, or\nmanage farming, gardening, and trade. \u201cAll provide income for your family without bringing\nshame to your ancestors,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAll are acceptable.\u201d44 Tang aristocrats would not have\nagreed.\nChapter 10, p. 23 231\nFig. 10.4 Jin Chushi, detail from \u201cTen Kings of Hell,\u201d before 1195.

The military-penal complex, as historian Elad Alyagon has dubbed it,\nincluded at its height 1.4 million men, as well as their families. The wives and daughters of poor\nsoldiers collected and sold firewood, wove sandals, collected night soil (human excrement used\nChapter 10, p. 24 232\nas fertilizer), brewed moonshine, or turned to prostitution. Officials illegally exploited the labor\nof both soldiers and army-camp courtesans.45 The dynasty displayed more compassion for\nsoldiers once they had died in battle than while they lived, paying monks to hold Buddhist\nmasses for their souls, lest they become vengeful ghosts.46\nFig 10.4 Li Gonglin, illustration for the Classic of Filial Piety (c. 1085).

A family could, by hard work and good luck and study, move up into the\ngentry elite. Conversely, a gentry family whose sons refused to study or work, but preferred to\ngamble and whore around, selling off the family library to buy wine and hire actors, could sink\nback into the working class in generation or two. As Song gentryman Yuan Cai warned:\nChapter 10, p. 25 233\n\u201cGentlemen and officials should try to count the number of their hometown\u2019s official families of\nthirty years ago who still survive today. They will find only a handful.\u201d47 Both the opportunity\nand the danger were ever-present in people\u2019s thinking.\nFig. 10.5 Song copper coin dating to 1102-1106. Why is this a good, practical shape for a coin? Source:\nMetropolitan Museum. Public domain.\nMoney and the Money Mentality\nOpportunity and danger rested on participation in the commercial economy. The Tang\ngovernment had controlled markets and prices, and relied on taxing self-sufficient households,\ndisdaining taxes on commerce. After Tang fell, in the \u201cFive Dynasties\u201d period (907- 960), the\nNorth was divided among dozens of local warlords. Seven relatively stable regimes held the\nformer Jiankang empire of the south, each eagerly promoting local products like salt, lumber,\npaper, cloth, and ceramics. These states taxed the private merchants who traded along the coast\nand to Liao, Kory\u014f, Japan, and Southeast Asia in necessities like iron and luxury goods like\nincense and gold jewelry. The direct trade with Japan, re-established in the 900s, was particularly\nvaluable, since the Hei\u2019an elite paid for books, ceramics, and textiles mainly with gold.48\nFollowing this Jiankang model, the Song state earned about 20-25% of its cash income\nfrom commercial taxes. The state also engaged in commerce directly, brewing ale and licensing\nothers to do so, for instance; making cash loans to sericultural families who repaid them in\nfinished cloth; and maintaining monopolies on tea (for a while) and salt production.49 Money \u2013\niron coins, then bronze coins and paper money \u2013 became ever more central to the economy, and\nsilk was no longer used as currency.\nThe money mentality entered every part of life in Song. In popular religion, people came\nto believe that they were born with a deposit of credit in a spiritual account, which they had to\npay back either by doing good or by burning \u201cspirit money\u201d \u2013 paper in the shape of silver ingots\nor imitating bank notes. Song poets, painters, monks, doctors, and all occupations saw\nthemselves as competing in a marketplace, catering to consumers who had plenty of choice.\nAwareness of money crept into every kind of writing and every area of life.

As\nnewly-wealthy families bought fancy, colorful paintings like those the court favored, literati\nasserted their cultural superiority through \u201camateur\u201d painting in black ink, less realistic and\ncolorful. To express the idea that officials served and created a prosperous nation, those\npaintings frequently incorporated ordinary people going about their business, and carrying things\nfor the elite men they accompanied.\nChapter 10, p. 28 236\nGender roles also intensified and changed in reaction to the market and the money\nmentality. Wealthy women gained some autonomy from the family because of increasing\neducation, expanding commercial opportunities, and high dowries (which legally belonged to the\nwife, not the husband or family). Poor women could also earn a living independent of the family,\nbut were increasingly in danger of being bought and sold on the market. Elite men responded by\nportraying women as dangerous, weak, and vulnerable, regardless of their individual status or\naccomplishments.51 Elite women responded, in turn, by adopting high-prestige behavior like not\nremarrying, avoiding contact with unrelated men, and practicing ostentatious frugality. Gender\nbecame a more apparently natural differentiation among people than rank.\nThe Money Mentality and Song Neo-Confucianism\nLikewise, the uncomfortable facts that gentry status relied on cash and an anonymous\nexamination competition may have given impetus to the revival of a strand of Confucianism that\nemphasized that a person\u2019s worth lay in his or her personal, individual moral understanding and\neffort, even without public recognition. For it was in Song times that Zhang Zai, the Cheng\nbrothers, and Zhu Xi developed \u201cNeo-Confucianism,\u201d which they called \u201cthe Learning of the\nWay\u201d (Daoxue \u9053\u5b78). In Song times, this new Confucianism was a minority movement; its\ninterpretation of the Classics was accepted as state orthodoxy only in 1313, under the Mongol\nYuan dynasty (1234-1367).\nIn Tang thinking, learned culture and literature \u2013 the family inheritance of aristocrats \u2013\nhad been in itself the Way. Some late-Tang men from lesser clans challenged this. The foremost\nwas Han Yu (768-824), who asked how writing could itself improve the world. He answered by\nadvocating a return to what he saw as the original, pre-Buddhist, Confucian ethical message for\nindividuals. He thought that writing should straightforwardly explain the way; literature could\nnot be the Way. Han Yu emphasized personal moral responsibility and saw Confucius as\nprimarily teaching about right and wrong.\nThis made sense to Song gentry, for their families did not reach all the way back to Han,\nor even to Tang. For the growing number of first-generation students, literacy was hard-won,\nwith a purpose and a message.52\nSong Neo-Confucians thought that after Mencius, the understanding of the Way\ntransmitted from the sage-kings and Confucius had been broken off. The Way was lost; and the\nconfusions of Buddhism and Daoism made things worse. The truth, the Way, was no-one\u2019s\nbirthright; it could be learned from the Classics, the only thing that did reach back to the sage-\nkings Yao and Shun. Neo-Confucianism opened a path to ethical social mobility that competed\nwith Buddhism and that broadened over the remainder of the late imperial period, just as\ncommercialization had opened a path to wealth and status.\nAs more men took exams, they could not all win official jobs. Their route to ethical\nachievement was to take over the Northern Song welfare programs, which the Southern Song\nstate dropped, and implement them in their local home areas. They replaced the Green Sprouts\nprogram with locally-managed community or charity granaries that could lend out grain to locals\nif they needed it, and collect moderate interest. They substituted local Confucian academies for\nWang\u2019s centralized educational system. For the centrally-organized mutual responsibility groups\n(which stretched back to Lord Shang\u2019s reforms in the state of Qin), they substituted \u201ccommunity\nChapter 10, p. 29 237\ncompacts\u201d that encouraged ethical behavior and family ritual among local residents. And as\ngentrymen who could not win office shifted their moral effort to local activism and their careers\nto business, teaching, medicine, and the like, gentry families began to marry close to home,\nbuilding dense local marriage networks instead of focusing on the capital area as Tang and\nNorthern Song elite families had done.53 This localization of the gentry elite \u2013 not feudalism,\nbecause they were subjects of and officials in a central bureaucracy that served an emperor they\ncould not challenge \u2013 became the long story of the later imperial period up to 1911.\nCommercialization had changed everything about the Song world. But people understood\nand managed that world not by rejecting, but by remaking and continuing the great tradition.\nFig. 10.8 Attributed to Liu Songnian, \u201cStreams and Mountains Under Fresh Snow,\u201d late 12th century.\nDetail, a gentleman being served wine or tea.

Shang kings used them in rituals of\ncommunication with his all-powerful ancestors, and were buried with them. Zhou kings and\nfeudal lords used bronze vessels to worship their shared ancestors, and rewarded their generals\nthe copper to make vessels telling their own ancestors about the king\u2019s recognition of their merit.\nLater, feudal lords distancing themselves from their lower-ranked relatives used bronze vessels\nin more public rituals to assert their superiority. Finally, bronze miniatures and imitations of\nbronze were used in graves, to save the real thing for living rituals.\nLike bronze mirrors and weapons in the peninsula+ and archipelago, bronze vessels\ndisplayed inherited power and rank. And the artisans and resources for the bronze were more or\nless directly controlled by the elite who used and displayed the vessels.\nFig. 11.1 Spouted wine vessel covered with fantastic birds, dragons, cats, and fish. 13th century BC, from\nAnyang or nearby.

Li Qingzhao (1084-1155)\u2019s autobiographical\n\u201cAfterword to Catalogue of a Collection of Bronze and Stone Inscriptions,\u201d describes how she\nand her husband shared a mania for collecting books and art objects, among them antique\nEpilogue, p. 1\n\"An Outline History of East Asia to 1200, third edition\" by Sarah Schneewind is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.\nRetrieved fr om https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9d699767 240\nbronzes. When Li and her husband saw a bronze vessel they could not buy, they made a rubbing\nof the inscription. They catalogued over 2,000 volumes of such inscriptions from bronze and\nstone. Knowing that the dire conditions of war and disorder would force Li to sell or abandon\nthe collection, her husband ordered her to keep the bronzes until the very last. Their collection\nwas not unique in Song, nor was the pair\u2019s habit of cataloguing and studying their objects.\nIn a catalogue of art objects in private collections, gentryman Zhou Mi listed, along with\n800 paintings, books, and other objects, nineteen bronze vessels. Some of the bronzes were\ngenuinely old, having been discovered when farmers accidentally dug up Shang and Zhou\ngraves. Others had been made recently for the art and antiques trade. The mania for antique\nbronzes led, in the Southern Song, to an industry that created \u201cold\u201d bronze goblets, horse\ntrappings, vases, candlesticks, statues, cymbals and bells and gongs. Copper was also used for\nweapons, cooking pots, Buddhist and Daoist statues and incense burners, mirrors, and\nornaments. By about 1050, copper mines were depleted, since Song did not control Yunnan\nwhere more mines opened in Yuan and Ming.2 Artisans melted down copper cash for the raw\nmaterial to make \u201cancient bronzes.\u201d3 Certain places, such as Jurong county outside Nanjing,\nwere particularly well-known for their production of ancient-style bronzes \u2013 places that had not\neven been part of the Shang culture area.\nZhou Mi\u2019s catalogue was the work of a lifetime. When he was fourteen, he was traveling\nwith his office-holding father (the family had produced officials for six generations) from the\nfamily estate north of Hangzhou (near Huzhou) to Quzhou in southern Zhejiang. There the father\nand son had met a circle of men who loved poetry and painting, but also studied ancient\ninscriptions on stone and bronze. As he hovered on the edges of the men\u2019s conversations in their\nfamily gardens, Zhou conceived a passion for studying, collecting, and authenticating bronze\nvessels. He eventually obtained rubbings of the inscriptions of such vessels, and perhaps even the\nbronzes themselves, from one of these men, who became his father-in-law. Zhou Mi and his\nfather arduously built up their own art collection while they served in office. They also carefully\nrecorded the events of their time: another sort of collection.\nLi Qingzhao lost her books, bronzes, and paintings when the Northern Song fell in 1127.\nLikewise, when the Mongol army took the Southern Song capital in 1276, Zhou Mi\u2019s whole\nancestral estate, with its library, residences, studios, and gardens, was destroyed; the entire\ncollection was looted, and all the written records kept by Zhou and his father were lost. Zhou Mi\nbecame deeply depressed, and slowly emerged only by obsessively writing poetry. He would not\nserve the new dynasty, but he socialized with many who did, including former Song subjects as\nwell as men from Mongolia and Central Asia. Zhou turned his knowledge, talent, and social\nconnections to writing history, and to evaluating and recording collections. In his catalogue,\nZhou Mi recorded the history of ownership of the finest bronze vessel he had seen, one now lost.\nThis fine vessel had belonged to Prime Minister Jia Sidao (1213-1275).\nJia Sidao was a typical gentryman of his time. The son of a middle-ranking military\nadministrator, he had come into office not by taking the prestigious jinshi examination, but\nthrough the less-esteemed shadow privilege: he won his first job because of his grandfather\u2019s\nofficial posts. His sister had been an imperial concubine, but Jia rose through the ranks not\nbecause of any special favor from the court, but because personnel officials recognized his\ncompetence. Like most gentrymen, he enjoyed all the entertainments of the capital, and loved to\ndrink and pass time with the talented and beautiful courtesans of Hangzhou. As well as\nEpilogue, p. 2 241\nproducing art himself, he was a great collector. He became Prime Minister from 1259. He had\nthe responsibility of running the government during the period when the Mongols\u2019 intention and\nability to conquer the Southern Song became very clear. Jia had some success in redistributing\nland to fund the army on the Legalist model.\nWhen an expedition against the Mongols failed in 1275, another high official\nmemorialized the Empress Dowager Xie, who was ruling for her husband\u2019s son, that Jia should\nbe executed as the person to blame for the defeat. The Empress Dowager objected that Jia had\nserved honestly and untiringly through the reigns of three emperors, but his fellow officials\ninsisted that he be banished. On the road to exile he was assassinated. In 1276, Mongol forces\ncaptured Hangzhou, and historians, at first gentrymen whose land-holdings Jia had threatened,\nreviled Jia as the man who lost the dynasty.\nJia Sidao\u2019s very best piece was the antique bronze vessel. The Empress Dowager had\ntried to protect Jia, but this bronze vessel entered her own art collection somehow. She too was a\ngreat collector of antiquities and art objects. Imagine the opportunities she had as empress for\nhalf-a-century, the power behind the throne for ten years, -- and the one who actually had to\norder the surrender of the Song capital to the Yuan armies. Jia had given her at least one other\nbronze vessel, inlaid with gold filigree.4 It is suspected that when he was exiled and the state\nconfiscated his collection, she appropriated much of the collection.\nThe antique bronze must have been surprised to find itself moving up from a minister to\nan empress. But what happened next was perhaps even more surprising. After the fall of the\nSong, the imperial collections were dispersed in various ways. Some pieces were stolen in the\nchaos that followed the occupation of the capital; others the Yuan invaders carefully stored away\nin several large ware-houses, and slowly sold off to raise cash. Zhou Mi saw many former\nimperial treasures in private hands: objects with imperial seals and inscriptions, decrees written\nin emperors\u2019 own handwriting. A similar thing had happened, of course, in the earlier fall of the\nNorthern Song capital of Kaifeng to the Jin dynasty in 1126. That time, 150 years earlier, an art\nand antique dealer named Bi Liangshi, having fled south with the court, managed to return north\non an official mission to the Jin. In the markets of Kaifeng he purchased many treasures from the\nformer imperial collection. When he returned to the Southern Song capital of Hangzhou, he\npresented the items to the emperor and was rewarded with an official position.\nSomehow, in the transition from Song to Yuan, the Empress lost Jia Sidao\u2019s fine bronze\nvessel. As the moment of surrender approached, she gave part of her collection to her relatives\nfor safe-keeping, but she took many objects with her when she was marched in captivity to the\nYuan capital. One official, Hu Yong, captured with the court, so ingratiated himself with the\nEmpress Dowager Xie that she sold him several imperial jade vessels.5 Hu Yong was generous\nand hospitable, and a responsible official, but he was also an avid collector, and as an ambitious\ncareer man he pursued official advancement partly by making handsome gifts of paintings to\nmen in high places.6 Whether or not it passed through Hu Yong\u2019s hands, Jia Sidao\u2019s bronze\nvessel went from the Empress Dowager to a wealthy merchant, a dealer in pearls known only as\nMr. Chen; and he in turn sold it to a monk called Youdeyuan. Nothing further is known of\neither.7 The gold-inlaid vessel that Jia Sidao had given to Empress Xie, was held first by a scion\nof the Song royal family, the very famous painter Zhao Mengfu; and later fell into the hands of a\nKorean merchant who sold it for forty liang (ounces) of silver to Hu Yong.8\nEpilogue, p. 3 242\nThe fact that a vessel made for Shang royal use, another made for some Zhou feudal\nlords, and imperial jade vessels made for the Song imperial family, could pass from hand to hand\nfor sale, up the social scale from minister to empress and back down to officials, merchants and\nmonks, is eloquent testimony to the great changes in the Song period. It was a time when the\nthings that had set the Tang aristocracy at the top of society and in the dominant position in the\nstate \u2013 land, books, scholarship and poetry, dignified mien and proper etiquette, old and beautiful\nobjects, family ritual, an illustrious genealogy, and extensive networks of connections \u2013 could\nall, if a family enjoyed several generations of prosperity and imitated upper-class modes of\nbehavior, be bought.\nPostface: Acknowledgements\nFor funding the composition of this textbook with a release from one course in 2019-\n2020, I thank Pamela Radcliff and Edward Watts, successive Chairs of the Department of\nHistory; Dean of Arts and Humanities Della Coletta; and Dean of Undergraduate Education John\nMoore.
