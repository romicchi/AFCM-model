Because the enter-\nprise of mentally applying yourself to a\nparticular topic is itself fulfilling. Like\nmany journeys, study can be boring and\ntiresome and often you wonder if you are\ngetting anywhere at all. But eventually\nyou will reach a place where you not only\ncan see how far you have gone, but a place\nwhere you can see things that you couldn\u2019t\nsee before, or maybe you reach a place\nwhere things that you\u2019 ve seen before now\nlook different and perhaps more under-\nstandable.\nFundamentally, this is a biology book.\nWhy study biology? Living things are fas-\ncinating for a wealth of reasons\u2014their\ndiversity, their complexity combined with\nKnowing something about the organisms\na fundamental simplicity, their function-\none sees while walking in the woods or any\ning that begs for explanation, the multiple\n\u2018natural area\u2019 vastly enhances the enjoyment\nways that living things exhibit organiza- of the experience.\ntion, the multiple interrelationships\nbetween different living things. Also, there is clearly a fascination of biology that stems\nfrom the fact that people are indeed biological in nature.\nWhy study \u2018inanimate\u2019 (non-animal) life? This book studies a group of living things that\nare distinctive because they aren\u2019t human, or mammalian or even animal in nature (hence\nthe title). In particular, why study plants, the primary subject of the book? There are at\nleast three basic factors that make a study of plants particularly rewarding. First, plants 2 | INTRODUCTION\nare familiar organisms, things that are readily and commonly encountered, so much so\nthat their fundamental biological nature is often ignored and they are simply consid-\nered inanimate components of the environment. Secondly, plants are extremely useful\nto human activities, not just as food but also by providing useful materials and chem-\nicals. Because of this, the study of plants has a connection to a host of human endeav-\nors. Thirdly, plants are the most conspicuous members of what is considered \u2018the natural\nworld\u2019 or \u2018the outside\u2019. Consequently, some understanding of plants can enhance the\nenjoyment of nature. An academic factor that makes plant study rewarding, and the rea-\nson for studying many inanimate (non-animal) organisms other than plants (e.g. fungi,\nbacteria), is that it enhances the understanding of other areas of biology by providing\ncontrasting structures, development patterns, and physiologies when compared to famil-\niar organisms.\nThere are many other reasons why the study of plants is rewarding, I\u2019m confident that you\nwill come up with additional reasons based on your own experience with the subject!\nAA bbrriieeff hhiissttoorryy ooff tthhee ddiisscciipplliinnee ooff \u2018\u2018bboottaannyy\u2019\u2019..\nThis book is a \u2018botany book\u2019 and the book has been used in courses that are considered\n\u2018botany\u2019 courses. Most people associate \u2018botany\u2019 with plants, but this is a book studies a\nnumber of things that are not considered plants, why include them? The reason has to do\nwith history and with classification.\nBotany texts, like most of academia, have a great deal of inertia and, in terms of groups\ncovered, this book perpetuates this. One hundred years ago, the field of biology was sep-\narated into botany and zoology, reflecting the binary taxonomy of the time that placed\norganisms into either the plant kingdom or the animal kingdom. Botanists studied organ-\nisms (plants, algae, some bacteria) that were green (contained chlorophyll) and also other\nforms of life (e.g. fungi) that weren\u2019t green but had some \u2018plant-like\u2019 features (cell wall,\napparent lack of mobility, pattern of growth). As in any classification (more on this\nlater!) there were organisms, most of whom were generally unicellular and small in size\nthat had both \u2018animal-like\u2019 and \u2018plant-like\u2019 characteristics. These were often covered in\nboth botany and zoology courses. Both textbooks and courses were \u2018survey\u2019 courses, going\ngroup by group through the members of the plant or animal kingdom. INTRODUCTION | 3\nAs the 20th century progressed, more and more biological knowledge accumulated that\nrevealed the commonality of all living things, topics like genetics, cell biology and bio-\nchemistry. Botany textbooks expanded adding elements common to all living things in\naddition surveying different groups. At the same time, botany and zoology departments\nmerged into biology departments and introductory courses and textbooks reflected this\nmerger.\nThroughout the 20th century it became increasingly clear that the dichotomous classifica-\ntion (plants and animals) was undesirable for multiple reasons. In 1969, Robert Whittaker\nproposed a five-kingdom system, with three familiar groups (\u2018Kingdoms\u2019 in a taxonomic\nsense)\u2014plants, animals, and fungi, and two novel Kingdoms, protists and monerans.\nMonerans were prokayotes, primarily unicellular organisms with cells that lacked nuclei\nand other organelles. This was in contrast to the four other Kingdoms that had eukary-\notic cells, ones that possessed a nucleus and membrane bound organelles. The novel Pro-\ntist Kingdom contained photosynthetic groups (algae) and non-photosynthetic groups,\nincluding many \u2018problematic\u2019 groups that weren\u2019t obviously plants, animals or fungi. In\nspite of the taxonomic changes, most botany textbooks did not alter their coverage, only\nslightly changing how topics were organized. A few botany textbooks focused only on\norganisms considered to be in the plant kingdom, omitting photosynthetic protists (algae)\nand fungi.\nWith the start of the 21st century Whittaker\u2019s classification scheme fell out of favor, pri-\nmarily because neither the protist group nor the monera group was a sound phylogenetic\n(evolutionarily-based, more details on this later) entity. \u2018Surveying\u2019 life in an accurate phy-\nlogenetic sense became more difficult, especially for the groups formerly considered pro-\ntists, whose members do not group nicely. Where you used to have one group (protists)\nyou might now have a dozen groups, all fairly obscure. And while five kingdoms could be\nmanaged, twenty kingdoms is more challenging. In spite of this, most botany textbooks\nin use today still approach to the subject as they have in the past: discuss the biology com-\nmon to all organisms then survey the groups, with the precise groups surveyed varying\nbetween books.\nAs a consequence of the expansion of cell and molecular information, the amount of cov-\nerage of plants and of \u2018inanimate life\u2019 (everything other than animals) is drastically less\nthan it was fifty years ago. The same can be said for other taxonomic groups: birds, fish,\ninsects; but the problem is particularly significant for \u2018inanimate life\u2019 because it is funda-\nmentally more obscure to most biology students and instructors. Additionally, the cover- 4 | INTRODUCTION\nage given to what you might think of as organismal biology in general, what an organism\nis and how it functions, is very much reduced because the discussions of various groups\nare often dominated by taxonomic/phylogenetic/evolutionary aspects, with primary con-\ncern placed upon where a particular group might be put with respect to other groups.\nThis book is both traditional and non-traditional. Although the kinds of organisms this\ntext studies is similar to most botany texts of the last hundred years, the approach to study\nis very different. This book is focused organismal biology, not phylogeny/taxonomy. It\nconsiders most of the groups that were covered in traditional botany texts, that is, \u2018EBA =\neverything but animals\u2019: plants, fungi, bacteria/archaebacteria, and most of the organisms\nthat used to be placed in the protist category. But the approach to these groups is \u2018organ-\nismal\u2019 and comparative. It attempts to define the organism level of life (Chapter 1) and\nthe classification of organisms (Chapter 2). The book then comparatively examines four\nfeatures that define organisms: their structure (Chapters 3-10) their means of reproduc-\ntion (Chapters 11-17), their acquisition of matter and energy (Chapters 18-25), and their\ninteractions with conditions and with other organisms (Chapters 26-31). The approach\nis much more ecological (at the organism level) and much less phylogenetic/evolutionary\nthan in botany texts or in introductory biology texts. A comparative approach, consid-\nering both the unifying features and the distinctive features of organisms, provides an\nenhanced perspective from which to consider the biology of plants.\nThis book is focused at the intersection of two biological phenomena: organisms and\nplants. In spite of this focus, it considers a wide area of biology \u2014 from cells to commu-\nnities and from bacteria to fungi. It also considers a wide variety of organisms that are\nnot now considered plants. Although this is intended as a botany textbook, it should be\nof interest to anyone interested in the scope of biology, even if they are not particularly\ninterested in plants (something that it is hard for the author to imagine!!).\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Tree of life \u00a9 Maulucioni y Dorid\u00ed is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license INTRODUCTION | 5\nA \u2018tree of life\u2019 diagram depicting groups (basically the 5-kingdoms of Whittaker but with\nMonerans (aka prokaryotes) separated into Bacteria and Archaea) and evolutionary\nrelationships.

CHAPTER 1: ORGANISMS\nThis course is about organisms, biological things that most of us consider to be very famil-\niar. The idea that life comes in packages called organisms is something that we all accept.\nAnd, for most students, the study of biology, at least initially, is focused on organisms,\nmost often humans or things that are much like humans (mammals). Like a number of\nbiological concepts, \u2018organism\u2019 is sometimes hard to pin down and there are certain situ-\nations where the concept of organism doesn\u2019t apply very well, especially for some of the\nforms of life covered in this course. An understanding of organisms is enhanced by view-\ning them comparatively and by viewing them from different perspectives. This course\nviews organisms from four different perspectives, considering descriptions and compar-\nisons of their (1) structure, (2) reproduction, (3) acquisition of matter and energy and (4)\ntheir interactions with each other and the conditions present in their environment.\nOur first task is to try to define what an organism is. Let us start by looking at things that\nmight be considered organisms:\nFFiigg.. 11 HHooww mmaannyy ddiiffffeerreenntt oorrggaanniissmmss aanndd kkiinnddss ooff oorrggaanniissmmss ddoo\nyyoouu sseeee?? 8 | CHAPTER 1: ORGANISMS\nThe most obvious organisms are the moose.

Can we pin the word down?\n\u201cWhen I use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, \u201cit means just what\nI choose it to mean\u2014neither more or less.\u201d\nWords are essential to biology because they provide a means of communication and with-\nout some conformity on definitions communication can be difficult. At the same time,\nsome words need to remain somewhat ambiguous because to pin them down too far\nrenders them useless. Additionally, a word can shape thoughts and keep us from seeing\nphenomena. \u2018Organism\u2019 is perhaps such a word!! Here are some attempts to define an\norganism, each followed by some limitations of the definition:\n\u2022 An organism is a fundamental unit of life: \u2018Fundamental\u2019 is a pretty vague term\n(which indeed might make this definition more useful!) but many would consider\nthat a cell is the fundamental unit. It is important to realize that sometimes cells\nare organisms but sometimes they are just components of organisms. Most colleges CHAPTER 1: ORGANISMS | 11\nteach a course on cell biology but (surprisingly!) courses on organisms are less com-\nmon.\n\u2022 An organism is a unit of life that can reproduce: One of the characteristics of\norganisms is that they can replicate themselves, but they are hardly unique biologi-\ncal entities in this respect\u2014cells, DNA, organelles and sometimes even communi-\nties can replicate themselves. And one might be able (depending on definitions) to\ncome up with organisms that lack this ability (see the discussion of caterpillars\nbelow).\n\u2022 An organism is a cell or group of cells that is genetically distinct and genetically\nuniform. For familiar organisms (i.e., humans) this seems to work. Generally, a\nhuman organism is genetically distinct from its parents and from its offspring, and\nits cells are genetically uniform (except for sex cells). However, most unicellular\norganisms and many multicellular organisms produce \u2018clones\u2019 of themselves that are\ngenetically identical but most would consider the offspring to be new organisms.\nIndeed, humans occasionally have identical twins, with two individuals that are\nidentical genetically, and few (especially the twins!) would consider them one\norganism. Armadillos take this a step further and always give birth to genetically\nidentical quadruplets.\n\u2022 An organisms is a cell or group of cells that is spatially separated from other cells, a\nspatially discrete unit of life. Thus, individual cells are organisms (unicellular\norganisms) when they are not attached to other cells but if they are in a cluster (i.e.,\nattached to each other) then the cluster is considered an organism. This works\npretty well but there are problems:\n\u25e6 Sometimes connections are hard to see and what we consider to be separate\norganisms (e.g., aspen trees) are actually connected below ground by their root\nsystems. Is the tree an organism or the cluster of trees an organism?\n\u25e6 Pieces of organisms break off and become spatially discrete (e.g., leaves fall off\na tree)\u2014are falling leaves organisms since they are now spatially discrete?\nWhat about egg and sperm, they are spatially discrete bits of life, should they\nbe considered organisms?\n\u25e6 It is common to have spatially discrete structures (e.g., lichens, corals, mycor-\nrhizae) that are composed of cells that have very different genetic constitu-\ntions (lichens consist of a fungus and an alga, corals [often] consist of an\nanimal and an alga; mycorrhizae contain a plant and a fungus). Generally, we\nconsider associations of organisms to be a community, but maybe communi-\nties can be organisms? 12 | CHAPTER 1: ORGANISMS\n\u25e6 What constitutes attachment? Mosses and lichens are attached to trees but\nmost would not consider the combined entity to be an organism. Barnacles\nattach to whales but the combination is not considered a single organism.\n\u2022 An organism is a unit of life that is \u2018self-sufficient\u2019, that can \u2018make it on its own\u2019:\nMosses and lichens don\u2019t need the tree, they simply need to attach to whatever is\navailable. In contrast, a liver needs the rest of your body in order to survive. Red\nblood cells circulat ing in blood are not considered organisms whereas Paramecium\nor an amoeba circulating in a pond would be because they can survive on their own.\nHowever, there really are very few organisms that are truly \u2018on their own\u2019 and self-\nreliant: cows need grass, cows need a particular group of organisms in their diges-\ntive system, pine trees need fungi associated with their roots, and, as we will study,\nall plants need bacteria and fungi. Almost all organisms depend on other organisms\nfor their livelihood and it is very hard to use \u2018self-sufficiency\u2019 to define an organism.\n\u2022 An organism is a unit of life that is distinct in time; it has a starting point and an\nending point. For familiar (sexual, multicellular) organisms the start might be fer-\ntilization of an egg by a sperm and the end might be considered death. But organ-\nisms might start and end different ways. Consider a butterfly (the entity that can\nfly) : one might argue that it starts when it emerges from a chrysalis and ends with\nthe death of the butterfly. Similarly, one could argue that a caterpillar is an organ-\nism that starts as a fertilized egg and ends as a chrysalis. This certainly isn\u2019t death\nbut it is the end of the caterpillar. Thus, we might say that the thing we generally\ncall a butterfly exists in two different forms, both of them organisms: a caterpillar\nand a butterfly. Or consider a particular interesting form of life called a cellular\nslime mold. It sometimes exists as amoeba-like single cells. The cells engulf other\nbits of material, both living and dead, grow and divide to form more amoeba-like\ncells. When conditions are right the cells aggregate, forming a multicellular slug a\nfew millimeters long that moves briefly in a manner reminiscent of a slug and then\nstops moving and undergoes a transformation into a stationary entity with a base\nconnected to a thin stalk standing up to 10 mm in height with a ball at the top of\nthe stalk. In time, the ball breaks open, releasing single cells that are dispersed and\ncan grow into more amoeba-like cells. Like butterflies (and, as we will see, like some\nplants), cellular slime molds have multiple forms, in this case three: one form that\nspecializes in eating (the amoeboid cells), one specialized for moving (the slug) and\nanother that specializes in reproduction (the fruiting body). Thus, some \u2018living\nthings\u2019 exist multiple forms, and each of them might be considered \u2018an organism\u2019.\nAnd each form has a starting point and an ending point but they may not be the CHAPTER 1: ORGANISMS | 13\nfamiliar ones of fertilization (union of an egg and sperm) and death.\n\u2022 Organisms change through time, that is, they develop, changing in structure and in\nfunction. The simplest life-cycle pattern is a single cell that \u2018begins\u2019 when it is pro-\nduced by the cell division of an existing cell and \u2018ends\u2019 when that cell divides to pro-\nduce two daughter cells. Aside from growth, the basic structure (form) of the cell\nremains the same but internally (physiologically) there are a host of transforma-\ntions (i.e., development) that allow for the acquisition of the materials necessary to\nform a new cell as well as changes that allow for division to take place. Multicellular\norganisms generally start with a single cell that proliferates to many cells, and the\ncells stay together after divid ing to produce a multicellular form that generally\nchanges structure substantially, especially at the early stages of development. In\nmany familiar organisms the cells that are \u2018passed on\u2019 (i.e., that can initiate the next\ngeneration) are of two types (e.g., egg and sperm) and they need to find each other\nand unite in order to form a cell that is capable of dividing to produce a new multi-\ncellular form. But this is often not the case, as we will see when we study repro-\nduction, for many organisms a single cell released from a parent organism may\nundergo the developmental process that form a multicellular organism.\n\u2022 The development of familiar (animal) organisms is usually quite regimented and\nresults in a fairly consistent \u2018final\u2019 form. But we will see that the development of\nsome \u2018inanimate\u2019 (i.e., non-animal) organisms is not as rigid and, in fact, many of\nthe organisms that we will consider don\u2019t produce a \u2018final\u2019 form (an endpoint), they\nkeep growing and growing. How do organisms end? The end of an organism doesn\u2019t\nhave to be death by \u2018old age\u2019 (\u2018wearing out\u2019) or by being ravaged by environmental\nconditions (e.g., cold weather) or biotic interactions (a disease or a predator). The\nend of some organisms is an aspect of development, e.g., the end of a caterpillar is\nthe formation into a chrysalis, the end of the \u2018slug\u2019 stage of a cellular slime mold is\nits transformation into a stalked structure. This brings us back to the question of\nreproduction. As was mentioned above, one could argue that some organisms don\u2019t\nreproduce themselves: caterpillars don\u2019t make more caterpillars, they make butter-\nflies; and butterflies don\u2019t make more butterflies, they make caterpillars. We will\nstudy a number of \u2018biological things\u2019 that exhibit life cycles that include multiple\nforms, each of which could be considered an organism and each of which \u2018passes on\u2019\n(produces) a cell or a group of cells that develops to form the next stage (organism),\neventually repeating the cycle. Thus organismal life is perpetuated through time but\nis manifested in different forms, each an organism. If we consider the individual\nstages to be organisms then what might we call the entity that includes all stages? 14 | CHAPTER 1: ORGANISMS\nUsually it is also considered \u2018an organism\u2019 \u2014monarch butterflies are both the cater-\npillar and the butterfly. This perhaps unfortunate because it obscures some inter-\nesting biology; and it certainly makes defining \u2018organism\u2019 more challenging. In an\norganismal sense monarch butterflies are clearly not the same as caterpillars, their\nstructure and function are very different although they are connected to each other,\nnot only through developmental patterns but also in a genetic, evolutionary and\ntaxonomic sense.\n\u2022 Organisms might be defined by their ability to grow. This requires the acquisition\nof material and the use of that material to make the organism bigger. Although gen-\nerally this is the case, there certainly are some things that one might consider an\norganism that are not capable of growth: consider mayflies (the ones with wings,\nnot the aquatic form). These organisms aren\u2019t capable of growing because they\naren\u2019t capable of eating, their mouths are permanently closed! The same thing is\ntrue of the \u2018slug\u2019 form and the \u2018stalked\u2019 form of the cellular slime mold and, as we\nshall see, many plants transform from a form that is capable of growth to one that\nis not. Caterpillars grow but don\u2019t reproduce, butterflies don\u2019t grow but they do\nreproduce. The ability to grow is essential somewhere in the life cycle but does not\nhave to be present in all organisms.\n\u2022 One final aspect of organisms is that they are considered to be the unit of selection\nin Darwinian evolution, although occasionally arguments are made for selection at\nother levels of biological organization (genes, populations).\nOne of the purposes of this course is to give students a new perspective to understand life.\nUnderstandably, we all think that living things (i.e. organisms) are like humans. While all\nlife is fundamentally the same in its chemical composition and in how it functions, there\nare substantial differences in the way they go about the business of living. We will exam-\nine a variety of organisms, some very familiar like pine trees and dandelions, some very\nunfamiliar like cellular slime molds, and our emphasis will be on comparing and contrast-\ning a variety of features. This study should give students a new vantage point from which\nto study life\u2019s organization and behavior.\nSo, what are organisms? They are biological entities that can be defined in space (i.e. they\nhave a boundary and a form\u2013a structure) and can be defined in time (i.e. they have a\nbeginning and an ending and a pattern of development between these times). They func-\ntion in a way that ultimately results in their reproduction, i.e., making more of them-\nselves. Reproduction necessarily requires the acquisition of materials so that growth can CHAPTER 1: ORGANISMS | 15\noccur. Occasionally organisms have multiple forms and each of these forms can be con-\nsidered an organism (e.g., caterpillar and butterfly; amoebae, slug and fruiting stages of a\nslime mold). In situations like these, an individual stage might not both grow and repro-\nduce, but collectively, as result of the action of all the stages, both growth and repro-\nduction are accomplished. As a result of their structure and their activities, organisms\ninteract with their environment and with other organisms.\nFFiigg.. 55 TThhee ffrruuiittiinngg bbooddyy ooff aa ssttiinnkkhhoorrnn ffuunngguuss,, aa ssttrruuccttuurree\ntthhaatt ffaacciilliittaatteess rreepprroodduuccttiioonn..

For example, in\nSequoia National park stands \u2018General Sherman\u2019,\nconsidered to be the largest organism living on\nearth. Because organisms are discrete packages\n(i.e., with boundaries in space and time) it cer-\ntainly possible to name them. But there are an\nawful lot of them and it is simply impractical to\nname them all. However, if one observes organ-\nisms, it is quickly apparent that they occur in\ngroups, i.e. there are groups of them that look\nsimilar and thus the group can be considered an\nentity itself. Moreover, additional study will usu-\nally reveal that identified (i.e., defined) groups of\norganisms can often be: (1) subdivided into\nsmaller groups and (2) lumped together into big-\nger groups; that is, that the diversity of organ-\nisms is organized into clusters of similarity and\nthere are clusters of the clusters. These biological\npatterns seek an explanation: why do organisms\ncome in groups and why are there groups of\ngroups?\nEven if organisms did not \u2018naturally\u2019 occur in\ngroups it would be important for biologist to\ndefine groups; there is simply so much biological\nFFiigg.. 11 GGeenneerraall SShheerrmmaann,, aann oorrggaanniissmm\ndiversity that some sort of \u2018filing system\u2019 is\nwwiitthh aa nnaammee\nrequired to organize it all. Thus, there are two\naspects to organizing organisms into groups: (1) a practical aspect, producing a way to 18 | CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY\nmanage all the variety of organismal life, to arrange its vast diversity, (2) a mechanistic\n(process) aspect, producing a system that will allow biologists to understand mechanisms\nthat result in the patterns of diversity, e.g., why there are groups. To a large extent these\ntwo aspects can be satisfied simultaneously, i.e., there are systems that categorize life eas-\nily and also allow users to study the processes (evolutionary mechanisms) that lead to the\ncategories. However, the biological landscape is vast; clusters range from groups (species,\nor perhaps subspecies) that might have less than 1000 organisms that all \u2018look\u2019 very similar\nto groups (families, orders) that are comprised of millions of individuals, with members\nthat do not \u2018look\u2019 very similar yet do possess some \u2018fundamental similarities.\u2019 With such\na span in scale one should appreciate that there may be situations where a system that\nis useful to consider the evolutionary relationships (i.e., the phylogeny) between groups\nof organisms may not very handy as a filing system. Or, looking at it from a different\nperspective, classification schemes that easily organize life\u2019s diversity may not do so in a\nway that reflects the phylogeny of different groups. An example familiar to most biology\nstudents would be \u2018reptiles\u2019, a handy group in terms of classification (reptiles are verte-\nbrates that aren\u2019t amphibians, birds or mammals), but a group that does not represent\nphylogeny. This book is primarily about organisms. And while in general it will use a\nphylogenetically based classification scheme, occasionally it will consider groups that are\n\u2018artificial\u2019 and do not reflect a phylogenetic entity, examples would be \u2018green algae\u2019 and\n\u2018gymnosperms\u2019.\nWe will be dealing with scientific names, and the groups that they describe, throughout\nthe book and it is important to appreciate the basis and the limitations of the naming.\nShakespeare asks \u201cwhat\u2019s in a name?\u201d and answers with the implication that names are\nbasically trivial. But names are profoundly significant in ways that often are not appre-\nciated. Like water to a fish and air to humans, we are so immersed in names that we\nrarely stop to consider them. But names say much about humans, about how we think and\nwhat we think. Indeed, it is probably the case that names not only reflect how we think,\nthey may actually dictate how we think. Names reflect the organization by which we view\nthings and the way we process the information that we receive. While classification is use-\nful whenever one is faced with a large number of variable entities, we need to consider to\nwhat extent our classification is a reflection of our thought (i.e., we are imposing order on\nsomething that isn\u2019t really ordered) , or a reflection of reality (i.e., there is an order that\nwe are describing), or something in between. Stated another way, names reflect an orga-\nnization and it is important to consider whether the organization is inherent to what is\nbeing named or inherent to our minds. CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY | 19\nKeep in mind that naming is a grouping process, i.e., it is a mechanism to put \u2018things\u2019 (in\nour case biological things) together. Faced with diversity, humans lump things together\ninto categories, putting similar things together into groups; this makes the diversity more\nmanageable and this is what classification (naming) is all about. At the same time, one\nshould appreciate that any classification, in fact, the very process of \u2018naming\u2019, results in\na loss of information to the extent that any organism varies from the norm that charac-\nterizes the group. The name \u2018tree\u2019 sets up a classification of living things, one that is both\nuseful and arbitrary; not all trees are the same and describing something as a tree strips an\norganism its individuality. The same could be said for the terms \u2018sequoia\u2019, \u2018Sequoiadendron\u2019,\nand \u2018Sequoiadendron giganteum\u2019. For any named biological group, it is important to con-\nsider how \u2018real\u2019 the group is: do the entities naturally fall together or are we just putting\nthem together as a means to simplify the system. If the groups are \u2018real\u2019 (valid) a biolo-\ngist might consider what processes might relate to their validity; what process forms the\ngroup?\nThus the fundamental question to address when naming groups of things is what criteria\nwill be used to group them. For instance, if you are classifying motor vehicles one might\ngroup them based on color, on manufacturer, or on type of vehicle. When considering\norganisms, deciding what criteria to group them on is a tough question: organisms are\nexceedingly diverse and they differ in myriad ways. Because living things have many, many\ncharacteristics, there are many different ways that they can be grouped. Moreover, until\nsome goal has been attached to the classification, there is not \u2018right\u2019 way for it to be done;\nit is simply an arbitrary way to simplify a diverse system. Classifying cars based on color\nis certainly easy and, in some cases, might be useful, but it is not very useful if one\u2019s goal\nis to explain the overall patterns in car variation.\nTwo features make a classification easier to develop and make the entities thereby defined\nmore \u2018real\u2019, i.e., an accurate representation of the reality. One feature relates to the pattern\nof variation. Consider a group of organisms that has only one characteristic, or perhaps\nonly one characteristic that might distinguish one organism from another, for example, a\ngroup of organisms that are all the same except for length. Figure 2 (a) and (b) show two\nsuch groups of organisms, one where a classification (naming) is an accurate reflection of\nreality and one where it is not. Both plots are \u2018frequency histograms\u2019, showing the distrib-\nution of individuals of different sizes. The difference between the two is in the pattern of\nvariation. The group of organisms in 2(a) is easy to classify into three groups because the\nthere are \u2018gaps\u2019 in the distribution. A statistical way of describing what is shown in 2(a) is 20 | CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY\nthat one can define groups (\u2018small\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019, \u2018large\u2019) so that the variation within a group\nis small compared to the variation between groups. The group of organisms in figure 2(b)\nis less easily classified because there are no gaps in the distribution of organisms of differ-\nent sizes; there are no obvious groups, and whatever group you might define has as much\nvariation within it as there is between that group and the remainder of organisms. Note\nthat it certainly is possible to classify the organisms shown in 2(b); we could divide them\ninto that are \u2018small\u2019 (less than 6 units in length), \u2018medium\u2019 (greater than 6 but less than 16\nunits in length) and \u2018large\u2019 (16 units or more in length). Although such a classification is\narbitrary and not an accurate reflection of reality, this does not mean that it might not be\nuseful.\nFFiigg.. 22aa ((lleefftt)) aanndd 22bb ((rriigghhtt)) TTwwoo eexxaammpplleess ooff vvaarriiaattiioonn wwiitthhiinn aa ggrroouupp ooff oorrggaann--\niissmmss..

If all the small organisms of figure 2(a) were round, the medium sized one\u2019s\nsquare, and the large ones cylindric, there would be a correlation between size and shape.\nThis would make the categories (small, medium and large) more justifiable; it would make\nthem more \u2018real\u2019. Alternatively, if all the size groupings had all three shapes it would make\nthe categories based on size (or based on shape) less real.\nIn general, organisms show variation that is discontinuous and they exhibit correlation in\nvariation of different characters, and both these features make classification easier. These\npattens of nature not only make classification of organisms simpler, by reducing the num-\nber of characters that one needs to consider, it also hints that there are better, or perhaps CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY | 21\neven a \u2018best\u2019, way to classify living things. This might be described as a \u2018natural\u2019 classifica-\ntion\u2019, one that is based on \u2019fundamental similarities\u2019. This idea was apparent to early nat-\nuralists. Carl Linnaeus, who developed one of the first classification schemes, recognized\nthat his technique of classification, although useful, was flawed because it was not \u2018nat-\nural\u2019, i.e., it put things together based on features that did not correspond to many other\nfeatures. His categories were useful because they put organisms into bins and made their\ndiversity much more manageable, but Linn ae us appreciated that there was an organiza-\ntion to the diversity of living things and that this organization was not always reflected in\nhis categories.\nIf there was an organization to the diversity of living things, there should be a reason\nfor this. Three hundred years after Linnaeus, Charles Darwin, who was an excellent stu-\ndent of classification (of organisms as varied as beetles, orchids and barnacles) , came up\nwith an explanation for the correlated variation and for the observation that living things\nappeared to fall into \u2018natural\u2019 groupings: it was consequence of the process of evolution,\nthe changes in the characteristics of groups of organisms through time. The fundamental\nsimilarity of groups of organisms was due to the fact that together they shared a com-\nmon evolutionary ancestry. Indeed, Darwin\u2019s taxonomic acumen was highly significant to\nhis elucidation of the process of evolution. He made two key observations that were con-\nnected to his understanding of taxonomy:\n1. in widely separated parts of the world where conditions are similar, for example,\ndeserts in South America and in Africa, organisms often look similar even though\nthey are not \u2018fundamentally similar\u2019;\n2. in one region of the world where conditions varied considerably within a relatively\nsmall geographic area, e.g., going from plains to mountains in southern South\nAmerica, organisms that on first examination seem very different, upon closer\nstudy are \u2018fundamentally similar\u2019.\nThe process of organic evolution explained both of these patterns; in the first instance,\nconvergent evolution could cause organisms that are fundamentally different (i.e., not\nclosely related) to look superficially similar; in the second case divergent evolution (adap-\ntive radiation) could cause fundamentally similar (i.e., closely related) organisms to diver-\nsify and look different. It can be seen that although evolution explains different reasons\nwhy things might look alike, it does NOT, at least initially, explain how one might group\nthings: should it be on the basis of \u2018basic, i.e. fundamental, similarity\u2019 and thus combine 22 | CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY\nthings that may not look that similar until \u2018closely examined\u2019 (see figure 3 which shows\ntwo different members of the cactus family, a leafy cactus and a more \u2018normal\u2019 look-\ning cactus); or should things be grouped on the basis of \u2018superficial similarity\u2019, i.e. group\nthings if, on the surface, they look similar (see figure 4 which shows two plants that look\nsuperficially similar yet are \u2018fundamentally\u2019 different).\nThe distinction may seem petty (i.e. what is the difference between superficial similarity\nand fundamental similarity), but it has real consequences because perceptions vary. For\nexample, people commonly group flowers on the basis of flower color, which is one of the\nmost easily perceived characteristics of plants, but it turns out to also be one of the most\nsuperficial.\nFFiigg.. 33 TThheessee ttwwoo ppllaannttss aarree cclloosseellyy rreellaatteedd aanndd bbootthh iinn tthhee ccaaccttuuss ffaammiillyy,, yyeett\ntthheeyy \u2018\u2018llooookk\u2019\u2019 vveerryy ddiiffffeerreenntt,, wwiitthh tthhee PPeerreekkssiiaa ((oonn tthhee lleefftt)) hhaavviinngg aa mmoorree ttyyppiiccaall\nppllaanntt ffoorrmm wwiitthh ttyyppiiccaall lleeaavveess aanndd bbrraanncchheess,, wwhhiillee tthhee ssaagguuaarroo ccaaccttuuss oonn tthhee\nrriigghhtt hhaass eevvoollvveedd aa vveerryy ddiiffffeerreenntt ffoorrmm wwiitthh nnoo oobbvviioouuss lleeaavveess,, aann uunnuussuuaall\nbbrraanncchhiinngg ppaatttteerrnn aanndd aann aabbuunnddaannccee ooff ssppiinneess..

For\nthose who are studying organic diversity it would desirable to group things based on \u2018fun-\ndamental similarities\u2019 (= evolutionary ancestry) because, among other things, it allows us\nto view the consequences of evolution. But we are still left with the question of how to\nrecognize phylogenetic groups. From pre-Linnaean times through Darwin and up until\nthe middle of the last century, sci entists searched for features that they thought reflected\n\u2018fundamental similarities\u2019. After Darwin\u2019s ideas were accepted, scientists realized that\nwhat they were looking for were features that reflected the evolutionary past of organ-\nisms. But these characteristics are elusive entities and no one really knew if they had found\none because most evolutionary history is impossible to trace\u2014the fossil record is grossly\ninadequate except for large-scale overviews. 24 | CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY\nOver the last fifty years molecular biology brought new approaches to taxonomy. It allows\norganisms to be compared on the basis of similarities in the sequences of amino acids in\nproteins or sequences of nucleotide bases in nucleic acids (DNA, RNA). These are more\nthan just new features to be compared; they are features that one can argue do reflect\nevolutionary lineage. Through time, changes accumulate so that the longer the time since\ntwo lines diverge the more differences that accumulate in the sequence of amino acids in\nproteins or nucleotide bases in nucleic acids. One might argue that this is how classifi-\ncation has always been done, that the assumption has always been that groups \u2018accumu-\nlate\u2019 more and more differences through evolutionary time, forming separate groups with\ndivergent characteristics. Although this is true in a very general sense, classification has\nalways involved \u2018character weighting\u2019, i.e., observers have always felt that some character-\nistics, ones that are less easily modified by natural selection should have more \u2018weight\u2019 in\na classification than others, characteristics, e.g., flower color, that are readily shaped by\nevolution and thus might occur independently in two lines that are not phylogenetically\nrelated. The formation of groups is based not just on the accumulation of differences but\nrather the acquisition of key differences, the differences that reflect phylogeny. Molecular\nbiology not only provides a tremendous increase in characteristics that can be compared.\nIt additionally provides characteristics that are unlikely to be selected for by natural selec-\ntion. This is significant because if two organisms share a feature this can be explained\ntwo ways: (1) it may reflect a common ancestry (\u2018fundamental\u2019 similarity) , or (2) it may\nreflect a common selective force (\u2018superficial\u2019 similarity). However, if two organisms share\na feature that is unlikely to be selected for then the only explanation involves a common\nancestry. Assuming that one wants a classification based on ancestry, then using molecu-\nlar data provides multiple ways to trace ancestry.\nOne feature of biological classification from the time of Linnaeus to now, and a feature of\nmost (but not all) classifications, is that they are hierarchical, with species grouped into\ngenera, genera into families, families into orders, orders into classes, classes into phyla and\nphyla into kingdoms (and, some would add, kingdoms into domains). However, with the\nexception of species (whose definition we will consider later in the course), none of these\nlevels is defined\u2014a genus is a group of related species, but how closely related is never\nspecified. Thus, although it is often the case that there is agreement that a group of liv-\ning things represents a taxonomic entity, exactly what level that group should be placed\nat, and how this group relates to other groups, may be quite controversial. Moreover, the\nseemingly logical idea that groups should be organized on the basis of evolutionary ances-\ntry doesn\u2019t mesh very well with a classification that has levels\u2014evolution doesn\u2019t neces- CHAPTER 2: TAXONOMY AND PHYLOGENY | 25\nsarily operate in a way to produce levels; and there is no reason to assume that the levels\nproduced on one branch might coincide with levels on another branch. One can certainly\ndevise classification schemes that more closely match the way that we believe evolution\noperates; but these schemes will not be as useful in pigeon-holing (categorizing) living\nthings. As is the case with many concepts (and in fact with words themselves!) one must\nbalance between utility and accuracy; useful concepts often distort reality but making\nthem more real often renders them less useful.\nMost biologists approach classification from a \u2018cladistic\u2019 viewpoint that is centered on the\nidea that evolution produces \u2018clades\u2019 (groups) as a result of the splitting of a previously\nexisting clade. Seen through time one would see a branching diagram. In general, this\nprobably reflects the pattern of evolution and the development of diversity. But we have\ngood evidence that groups not only split but sometimes merge (e.g., the endosymbiont\ntheory for the appearance of eukaryotes; secondary endosymbiosis and the origin of mul-\ntiple algal groups) and neither cladistic approaches or a hierarchical system deals well\nwith this possibility.\nFor most of this book we will speak of groups that are generally considered \u2018real\u2019, that is,\na group of organisms that are set off, in terms of phylogeny and in terms of characteris-\ntics, from other living things. A non-phylogenetic classification of the groups covered in\nthis book is here (Table 1). Because our focus is on organisms and their diversity, we will\nbe less concerned with the exact placement of the group in a taxonomic scheme or the\nexact phylogenetic relationship between one group and others. Some of this information\nis covered in the phylogeny sections of the \u2018fact sheets\u2019 for specific groups found in the\nOrganisms section of the book. But note that the text as a whole is NOT organized along\nphylogeny/taxonomy lines. In fact, I will refer to a number of \u2018artificial\u2019 (i.e., non-phylo-\ngenetic) groups. These are listed below and serve as examples of groupings that are known\nto be artificial yet are useful for reasons of history, ecology or convenience.\n\u2022 \u2018inanimate life \u2019\u2014 living things that are not animals (i.e., in the Animal Kingdom).\nUsing a five-kingdom classification this would include Monera (i.e., prokaryotes),\nFungi, Plants and Protists.

For\nmulticellular organisms, the boundary is the collective of all the (generally specialized)\ncells on the organism\u2019s perimeter, its dermal tissues. For most of the organisms studied\nhere the dermal cells have a cell wall and also a specialized coating on the outside. This\nchapter examines the physical and chemical nature of organism boundaries and also con-\nsiders the significant functions of the boundary, starting with its influence on something\ncalled flux, the movement of materials in and out of the organism.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Boundaries and flux\n\u2022 Structural, chemical and physical nature of boundaries\n\u25e6 Membrane CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 29\nFFiigg.. 22 AA ccooccccoolliitthhoopphhoorree,, wwhhoossee\neexxtteerrnnaall bboouunnddaarryy ccoonnssiissttss ooff\nmmuullttiippllee ppllaatteess ooff ccaallcciiuumm ccaarrbboonnaattee..\n\u25e6 Walls\n\u25aa Polysaccharide cell walls\n\u25aa plants, fungi, bacteria, archaebacteria\n\u25aa Inorganic cell walls\n\u25aa Internal cell walls\n\u25e6 Dermal tissue\n\u25e6 Coatings\n\u2022 Boundaries and structure\n\u2022 Boundaries and movement\n\u2022 Boundaries and communication\nBBoouunnddaarriieess aanndd flfluuxx\nOne reason the boundary is significant because it represents a barrier to movement into\nand out of the organism. This movement can be described as a \u2018flux\u2019 and flux can be mod-\neled as being a function of three parameters present in the following formula (which is\nactually a model of what causes materials to move): 30 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nFlux = (driving force surface area) / resistance\n*\nWhile in many ways this equation is a simplification, it does point out the three funda-\nmental properties that determine the flow of materials into and out of the cell:\n\u2022 Driving force\u2014this is generally approximated by the difference in the concentra-\ntion of something on the inside vs. the outside, but in the case of heat flow the dri-\nving force is the difference in temperature; considering the movement of fluids\n(e.g., air, water) the driving force can be pressure differences. In all these situations,\nthe bigger the driving force, the more flux there is.\n\u2022 Resistance\u2014the resistance can be described as the difficulty with which materials\ncan move from the outside to the inside, or vice versa. Some materials readily allow\nthe movement of molecules (or heat) through them, i.e., they have a low resistance.\nOther materials only reluctantly allow materials (or heat) to move through them,\ni.e., they have a high resistance. It is important to appreciate that resistance\ndepends on the substance/ molecule one is keeping track off; a boundary may have\na very high resistance to some molecules and a very low resistance to others.\n(related terms are conductance and permeability, which, for our purposes, are the\nreciprocal of resistance)\n\u2022 Surface area \u2014 the more surface area through which materials can flow, the more\nflux.\nAs will be discussed in the next chapter, the surface area is determined by the shape and\nsize of the organism. The driving force is determined by where the organism is and what is\ngoing on inside and outside of the organism. Organisms can manipulate fluxes by manip-\nulating the driving force. Most of the discussion of these mechanisms is beyond the scope\nof this book but we will mention some in Chapter 22. In the case of the flow of materi-\nals or heat into and out of cells, the resistance to flux is determined by the chemical and\nphysical characteristics of the boundary between the organism and its environment.\nBesides being important in influencing the flux of materials into and out of organisms,\nboundaries serve other important functions that will be discussed after describing differ-\nent types of boundaries. CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 31\nSSttrruuccttuurraall,, cchheemmiiccaall aanndd pphhyyssiiccaall nnaattuurree ooff\nbboouunnddaarriieess\nCell membrane\nThe chemical nature of the cell membrane should be familiar to biology students: a phos-\npholipid bilayer with proteins imbedded in and through it. The two sides of this mem-\nbrane are \u2018w et\u2019 (i.e., hydrophilic) due to the attraction of polar water molecules to the\ncharged phosphate groups of the membrane. The interior of the membrane is dry (i.e.,\nhydrophobic) because lipid molecules carry no charges and have no regions that are even\npartially charged and to which a polar (= partially charged) water molecule might be\nattracted. However, there are tubular proteins passing through cell membranes. These\ntubular proteins may have a \u2018wet\u2019 in interior, providing for water filled channels running\nfrom the outside to the inside. Some of these channels allow selective passage of ions and\nmany of these can be manipulated (opened or closed). Although the chemical nature of\nthe hydrophobic layer is different in the Archaea, the basic structure of membranes is fun-\ndamentally the same for all organisms. Significant to organism function is that the mem-\nbrane is quite permeable (low resistance) to small, uncharged molecules (significantly O ,\n2\nCO and H O) but not very permeable (high resistance) to charged molecules (ions) and\n2 2\nto larger molecules, especially if they are not soluble in lipids. The cell membrane gener-\nally has little strength and readily yields to internal and external forces, that can cause the\ncell to change shape. Organisms lacking a cell wall in terrestrial environments cannot be\nvery tall because the force of gravity flattens them. This can be overcome with an internal\nskeleton (vertebrates) or an external one (exoskeleton), which is a rigid boundary.\nCell walls\nIn contrast to the consistent presence and composition of the cell membrane in the cells\nof organisms, cell walls show much greater variability. Many organisms (e.g., almost all\nanimals) have no cell wall. For the organisms that possess walls, its composition is quite\nvariable (Table 1), although some of its structural features are more consistent. 32 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nFFiigg.. 33 AA rreepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff aa mmeemmbbrraannee sseerrvviinngg aass aa bboouunnddaarryy ttoo cceellllss aanndd oorrggaanneelllleess..\nPPoollyyssaacccchhaarriiddee cceellll wwaallllss\nThe cell walls of plants, fungi, water molds, brown algae, red algae and (most) green\nalgae have a similar structure and chemistry. These cell walls are composite structures,\nand can be considered to be gels. They consist of fibers made of elongate carbohydrate\npolymers that resist being stretched. These are imbedded in a matrix of different carbo-\nhydrate polymers that are highly hygroscopic (water absorbing) (Fig. 4).\nTwo common fiber materials are cellulose (found in plants, water molds and green algae)\nand chitin (found in fungi). Cellulose is a polymer made up of glucose monomers, as is\nthe more familiar polysaccharide, starch, but the two have very different roles, one struc-\ntural and one energy storage. Chitin is also a polysaccharide polymer but the subunits\n(N-acetylglucosamine) are hexoses with a nitrogen attached (Fig. 5).\nThe fibers of cellulose and chitin are consist of multiple (20-100) individual polymer mol-\necules that interact with neighboring molecules to form a crystalline structure of the\nfiber. These fibers are significant in multiple ways: (1) because there are multiple mole-\ncules and they are bound to each other, the fibers, and the wall they are present in, are\nconsiderably \u2018stronger\u2019 (see below) than would be the case if the individual molecules did\nnot interact to form fibers; (2) the fiber is difficult to digest because the component poly-\nmer molecules are not very accessible to enzymes and the fiber itself is not soluble in\nwater, in spite of the fact that the monomers units, e.g. glucose, are very soluble in water.

This is because the polymer \u2018chain\u2019 con-\nsists of several subunits, not just one, and also because the linkages between subunits are\nmore variable, not always the same one, and not always \u2018end to end\u2019 but with branching\n(one subunit connected to three other subunits, not just to the ones \u2018in front and behind\u2019\nit). While these polymers are given names (hemicellulose, pectin, agaropectin), the names\nrefer to groups of chemicals and not to a specific chemical structure and composition.\nSome of these chemicals bind to cellulose or chitin fibers, connecting them to each other\nand providing more structure to the cell wall and also allowing the cell walls of adjacent\ncells to be bound to each other.\nAlthough they are made primarily of polysaccharides, these cell walls contain some pro-\ntein molecules. The function(s) of the proteins are not known with certainty. They are\nprobably not particularly significant structurally in the way that the chitin and cellulose\nare and the way that the intracellular proteins tubulin and actin are. The protein compo-\nnent of the cell wall is probably significant in being able to change, through enzymatic\naction, the structure of the rest of the wall, e.g., during cellular growth when the wall 34 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nFFiigg.. 55 AA rreepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff tthhee pprriimmaarryy cceellll wwaallll ooff ppllaannttss,, ccoonnssiissttiinngg ooff fifibbeerrss ooff cceelllluulloossee\niimmbbeeddddeedd iinn aa mmaattrriixx ooff wwaatteerr aabbssoorrbbiinngg ppeeccttiinnss aanndd hheemmiicceelllluulloossee..

The absorption of water comes from the adhesion of water molecules to the car-\nbohydrate components of the cell wall, in particular the \u2018matrix\u2019 polymers (e.g., pectins,\nhemicellulose) plus the cohesion of water to itself. The hydrophilic nature of the cell\nwall makes it highly permeable (low resistance) to the movement of water (as a result of\neither diffusion or as a result of pressure differences, i.e., mass flow (m ore discussion on\nthis when discussing material movement, Chapter 24). Small water-soluble molecules also\nmove readily through the wall both as a result of their individual diffusion and as a result\nof being dissolved in water that may be moving via mass flow. However, dissolved ions\nmay be slowed by becoming bound to charged components of the polysaccharides.\nUnder some circumstances, the cell wall of plants can shift from being hydrophilic to\nbeing hydrophobic as the result of the deposition in the cell wall of \u2018water-proofing\u2019 mate- CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 35\nrials called cutin and suberin. These materials are found in cell walls of certain plant tis-\nsues and their ability to retard the movement of water is significant. Both suberin and\ncutin are mixtures of multiple compounds including polymers with hydrophobic subunits\nand wax molecules. Like the lipid portion the cell membrane, these chemicals are \u2018dry\u2019\n(hydrophobic) and water movement through walls with these materials is much retarded.\nWhile there are some chemical differences between the two, the primary distinction\nbetween cutin and suberin is location. Cutin is deposited in a coating called cuticle, pre-\nsent on the external walls of cells located on the outside of the aerial portions of plants.\nSuberin is deposited in the walls of certain cells as they are produced. Suberin is found in\nthe above-ground portion of the plant in places where growth or mechanical damage has\neliminated the cuticle. Suberin is also found in the below-ground portion of most vascular\nplants in a cylindrical tissue called the endodermis, whose significance will be discussed\nlater.\nA final component found in some polysaccharide cell walls is lignin, a material absent in\nnon-vascular plants (e.g., mosses) but found in the cell walls of most vascular plants, and\na material that is highly significant to their evolutionary success, i.e., their prevalence in\ntoday\u2019s flora. Structurally, lignin is similar to pectins and hemicellulose, i.e., a matrix that\nsurrounds cellulose fibrils. Lignin is produced in what is described as the secondary cell\nwall, a component of the cell wall present only in certain cells. The secondary cell wall is\nlaid down after cells have stopped growing, necessarily so because lignin is a rigid material\nthat will not yield readily, therefore preventing the cellular expansion needed for growth.\nLignin is the material that makes wood tissues woody. It is stiff and rigid and allows plants\nto be tall by resisting the compressive force of gravity. Like hemicellulose and pectin,\nlignin is a complex polymer with subunits that are not all the same and are not always\nconnected the same way. Moreover, the subunits of lignin are not sugars, they are phe-\nnolic molecules chemically quite different from sugars. Lignin polymers extend in three\ndimensions, forming a solid material. Lignin is hard to digest and its breakdown products\nare phenols, chemicals that are poisonous to many organisms. Hence, lignin is resistant\nto degradation. The secondary cell wall is deposited inside of the primary cell wall and\nit necessarily shrinks the space available to the membrane bounded cytosol, sometimes\neliminating it almost completely. Most cells with secondary cell walls are short-lived and\nare structural, providing function to the plant when they are dead. 36 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nBacterial cell walls\nNot all bacteria possess cell walls but the ones that do possess a wall material unique to\nbacteria called peptidoglycan. As the name implies, peptidoglycan has components that\nare peptides (sequences of amino acids) and components that are sugars (carbohydrates).\nUnlike the polysaccharide wall materials described above that are chains of monomers,\npeptidoglycan polymers form a mesh, a three-dimensional molecule (like lignin) with\nunits linked not just end-to-end but also above-and-below and side-to-side. Also signifi-\ncant is the fact that many bacteria, including \u2018gram-negative\u2019 bacteria and cyanobacteria,\nhave an \u2018outer membrane\u2019, a second phospholipid membrane that occurs outside of a thin\npeptidoglycan cell wall. Some bacteria possess one additional layer, an \u2018S-layer\u2019, a protein\nlayer on the very outside of the cell, outside the outer membrane of gram-negative bacte-\nria and the peptidoglycan cell wall layer of gram-positive bacteria.\nArchaea cell walls\nRecall that Archaea and Bacteria are prokaryotes and used to be considered a single\ngroup. One of the several features that distinguish Archaea is a distinct cell wall structure\none that lacks peptidoglycan. The chemical composition of Archaeal cell walls is diverse\nand some have a cell wall composed of a carbohydrate/peptide material similar to pepti-\ndoglycan. Like some Bacteria, most Archaea are bounded on the outside by an S-layer, a\nself-assembling structure composed of globular proteins or glycoproteins.\n\u2018Inorganic\u2019 cell walls\u2019\nAll of the cell wall materials discussed so far would be considered \u2018organic\u2019, a flexible\nterm whose exact meaning wanders considerably. In this context it refers to \u2018biological\nmaterials\u2019, molecules found in living things, as opposed to inorganic molecules, those gen-\nerally found in non-living things, e.g. rocks/minerals. Two important cell wall materi-\nals, calcium carbonate and silica dioxide, are most commonly found as minerals in rocks.\nHowever, these minerals are in some sense \u2018organic\u2019 because they can be produced by bio-\nlogical processes, cells produce conditions whereby calcium carbonate or silicon dioxide\nis precipitated out of solutions. In fact, their presence in some rocks is completely due to\ntheir manufacture by marine organisms whose remains became deposits at the bottoms\nof oceans and eventually in rocks. The \u2018White Cliffs of Dover\u2019 (Fig. 6) are formed from CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 37\na massive deposit of coccolithophores, a type of marine algae that produces distinctive\nlooking calcium carbonate plates as its outside boundary (Fig. 2). Although not as com-\nmon or extensive as calcium carbonate cliffs, there are similar deposits of \u2018diatomite\u2019, a\nsedimentary rock formed from deposits of diatoms, another unicellular photosynthetic\norganism that produces an external skeleton, i.e., a cell wall, made of silica dioxide (Fig.\n1). Exactly how the material is precipitated in such a precise, and often ornate, manner is\nnot known with certainty.\nFFiigg.. 66 TThhee wwhhiittee cclliiffffss ooff DDoovveerr aarree aa ccaallcciiuumm\nccaarrbboonnaattee ((cchhaallkk)) ddeeppoossiitt ffoorrmmeedd bbyy bbiilllliioonnss ooff\niinnddiivviidduuaall ccooccccoolliitthhoopphhoorree \u2018\u2018sskkeelleettoonnss\u2019\u2019 ffrroomm\noorrggaanniissmmss tthhaatt lliivveedd iinn aa CCrreettaacceeoouuss sseeaa..

One example is gram negative bacteria where\nthere is a wall inside a membrane, but these bacteria also have a second membrane in its\nnormal location, inside the cell wall. In contrast, dinoflagellates have plates of cellulose\nenclosed in membranes that occur inside of the plasma membrane. Cryptomonads have\nwall-like glycoprotein plates both inside and outside of the plasma membrane, forming a\nstructure called the periplast that is unique to this group of organisms. 38 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nDermal tissues of multicellular organisms\nMost multicellular organisms have groups of cells, called dermal tissues, that form a \u2018skin\u2019\nto an organism. These cells / tissues will be considered anatomically in a later chapter but\nthey generally are cells tightly bound to each other (no spaces between them) so that they\ncollectively form a boundary to the organism. Often these cells have different components\nin their cell wall (e.g., cutin, suberin, lignin) and/or produce a secretion on the outside\n(cuticle, see below) that is important to their functioning. Additionally, many multicellu-\nlar organisms produce structures, organs, that have specialized boundaries that are signif-\nicant to their role. In inanimate life the most common of these are organs associated with\nreproduction, e.g., spore cases (sporangia), fruits and seeds. The \u2018skin\u2019 of these structures\nmay be important in protecting the structures inside, e.g., the sporangium of mosses, the\noutside of an acorn (a fruit wall), the seed coat of apple seeds (in the latter two cases it\nis lignin depositions in the cell walls of dermal cells that are particularly important). The\n\u2018skin\u2019 of reproductive structures must eventually open up and allow the dispersal/release\nof its contents and sometimes features of the \u2018skin\u2019 actively participate in dispersing its\ncontents (see discussion below on \u2018explosive\u2019 movements). In other situations, the per-\nmeability of the coating, in particular how much water/oxygen enters, can significantly\ninfluence the behavior of the enclosed structures.\nSpecialized coatings\nSome organisms /colonies of organisms cover themselves or part of themselves with some\nsort of coating. A number of algae and bacteria coat themselves in a polysaccharide gel\noutside of the cell wall. A striking example of this is with some species of Nostoc, a colo-\nnial, filamentous cyanobacterium that sometimes forms gelatinous sheets or spheres that\nmay be several centimeters across (Fig. 7). The bulk of the sphere is a polysaccharide secre-\ntion deposited outside the cell walls of individual cells. Coatings may be significant to the\norganism for a variety of reasons including: retention of water, protection, adhesion to\nsubstrates, keeping a colony of cells together, buoyancy. Similar coatings are sometimes\nimportant in producing biofilms, communities of one to several organisms including bac-\nteria, archaea, fungi and others, that coat surfaces (e.g., dental plaque) and are sometimes\nimportant ecologically and to human disease).

The cuticle is a com-\nplex mix of chemicals including cutin (mentioned above as a component of some cell\nwalls) and other similar (hydrophobic) constituents. The cuticle is much more imperme-\nable to water (it has a high resistance to water movement) than the membrane because it\nis substantially thicker and also because proteins do not span across it. The cuticle\u2019s high\nresistance to water movement is significant because it lessens water loss from plants to\nthe atmosphere. However, the cuticle is also impermeable to gases, in particular carbon\ndioxide, and this feature has important consequences for photosynthesizing plants. The\ncuticle is produced by the cells on the outside of the plant, and the outer part of the cell\nwalls of these cells have extensive deposits of cutin. In addition, hydrophobic materials are\ndeposited completely outs ide of the cell wall (outside the area where cellulose microfib-\nrils are present). The mechanism whereby materials can be deposited outside of the cell\nwalls is not completely understood.\nIn addition to reducing water loss, the cuticle is a physical barrier to the entrance of\norganisms into plants, and it also serves to absorb and reflect UV radiation, thereby pro- 40 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nFFiigg.. 88 HHoossttaa lleeaavveess sshhoowwiinngg tthhee hhyyddrroopphhoobbiicc nnaattuurree ooff tthhee ccuuttiiccllee wwhhiicchh ccaauusseess wwaatteerr ttoo\nmmoouunndd uupp iinnttoo sspphheerreess..\ntecting tissues within. Also, the dryness of the cuticle, along with other specific chemi-\ncal features, makes it a very inhospitable place for the growth of other organisms, adding\nto its protective function. The cuticle of many plants may be ruptured by growth from\nwithin (discussed later). In these cases, the protection of the cuticle is replaced by a new\nlayer or layers of cells that are produced with suberin in their cell walls, forming the out-\nside portion of what we know as bark.\nSpropollenin\nPollen grains (of seed plants) and the spores of a variety of organisms are coated with\nsporopollenin, a chemical that is particularly resistant to degradation and is thought to\nbe significant in protecting against desiccation, oxidation and enzymatic degradation. It\nis the resistance of sporopollenin to breakdown that allows pollen buried several hundred\nmillion years ago in sediments to be preserved and recognized. Its exact chemical nature CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 41\nhas not been determined (partly because it is so hard to breakdown!) but it has some sim-\nilarities to cutin in having hydrocarbon components as well as phenolic components.\nBBoouunnddaarryy ddiivveerrssiittyy\nThe following table summarizes boundary materials for organisms that we cover (plus a\nfew others) grouped grouped by whether they are unicellular or multicellular and whether\nor not they possess a cell wall.\nCCeellll wwaallllss,, cceellll mmeemmbbrraanneess aanndd ssttrruuccttuurraall iinntteeggrriittyy\nOne reason that an organism\u2019s boundary is significant is because the boundary resists\nphysical forces that are acting on the organism. These forces can come from the outside\n(e.g., wind, gravity) or from the inside (internal pressure). For unicellular organisms it\nis the strength of the boundary that prevents (or allows) deformation that would come\nabout as a result of these forces. For multicellular organisms it is the boundaries of indi-\nvidual cells and also their linkages to each other that determine how the organism will\nrespond to external forces.\nOsmotic forces\nA common factor that might cause a cell to change shape is \u2018osmotic disruption\u2019, brought\nabout by osmosis, the diffusion of water. All other things being equal (more in Chapter 22)\nwater moves by diffusion from areas where it is purer (i.e. has less solutes) to areas where it\nis less pure (has more solutes). Since living things acquire and manufacture solutes and the\nimpermeability of the cell membrane allows these solutes to be concentrated inside cells,\ncells are often are in situations where water is going to spontaneously move into them.\nThe cell membrane offers little resistance to expansion and is not able to be stretched.\nConsequently cells/organisms with only a membrane will burst if exposed to pure water,\nor any water that is purer than that inside the organism, unless they have mechanisms to\neliminate the water. The presence of a cell wall outside the membrane solves this problem\nbecause it resists expansion. This allows the cell to pressurize, and this pressure prevents\nthe entry of more water (note that diffusion is NOT just dependent upon differences in\npurity, as it is often described. It is also dependent upon pressure, more in Chapter 24). 42 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nTable 1\nBoundary\nand\nOrganisms Features\norganism\ntype\nUnicellular\norganisms Some bacterial\nMostly parasites\nwith no groups\nwalls\nCellular slime\nFor parts of their life cycle they do have walls\nmolds\nPlasmodial slime\nLike a giant amoeba\nmolds\nNo wall, but the membrane is reinforced with protein\nEuglenoids filaments forming a structure called a pellicle, often\nexhibiting parallel striations on the outside\nWall-like materials (glycoproteins) both inside and\nCryptomonads outside of the plasma membrane, forming a structure\ncalled a periplast.\nOften possess multiple \u2018plates\u2019 of cellulose that lie\nDinoflagellates\ninterior to the cell membrane\nMulticellular\norganisms\nwith cells Animals Many do have coatings (\u2018skin\u2019) that are groups of cells\nwith no\nwalls\nUnicellular\nWall contains a peptidoglycan polymer with\norganisms Bacteria (most),\npolysaccharide and amino acid components.

Many plant cells develop an inner\nplants) secondary cell wall containing cellulose and lignin, a\ncomplex, phenolic polymer. 44 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nIt is important to note that the strength required to resist expansion is \u2018tensile\u2019 strength.\nThe cell \u2018resists\u2019 water absorption because components of the wall (e.g., cellulose or chitin\nmicrofibrils) are resistant to being stretched.\nIf the cell with a cell wall were in an environment causing it to lose water, e.g., an aquatic\nhabitat high in solutes or in a terrestrial habitat where organisms are losing water to a\ndrying atmosphere, water would diffuse outward and the presence of a wall would not\nprevent the cytosol from collapsing unless the membrane were somehow glued to the cell\nwall to prevent it. This is not thought to be the case. Moreover, for plant cells with only\nprimary cell walls (no lignin reinforcement) or fungal cells, the wall is not strongly resis-\ntant to compression and if water leaves the cell the cell will shrink in size (collapse). Note\nthat although cellulose fibers have a high tensile strength, they are not very resistant to\ncompression, i.e., have little compressive strength. Consider a string (which often times\nis actually a collection of cellulose microfibrils): you can pull on the string and it resists\nstretching but it is very easy to collapse the string, it has very little compressive strength.\nWalls and \u2018structural integrity\u2019\nCells and organisms do need compressive strength to: (1) provide protection from certain\npredators who would like to crack them open to get to the goodies inside, and (2) allow\nthe organism/cell to resist various forces in the environment, e.g., gravity. Resisting forces\nbecomes more significant if organisms are bigger, especially for organisms in terrestrial\nenvironments where the surrounding medium (air) provides little support. In terrestrial\nenvironments, organisms will be collapsed by gravity if they are more than a few cen-\ntimeters in height unless they have structural strength to resist it. Three-dimensional wall\nmaterials (e.g., peptidoglycan, calcium carbonate, silica dioxide), can resist compression\nbut these wall materials are only present in very small organisms. Plants are \u2018big\u2019 and\nterrestrial, how do they resist gravity? Walls with lignin, another 3-dimensional mater-\nial, will resist compression, but not all plant cells have lignin. Plant cells lacking lignin\nhave structural integrity against gravity because of the combination of water, a membrane\nthat \u2018holds\u2019 solutes but allows water movement, and a cell wall that has tensile strength.\nWater is very difficult to compress as long as it is contained in something that doesn\u2019t\nallow water to escape. It might seem that water should be able to be \u2018squeezed out\u2019 of cells\nby the force of gravity but this doesn\u2019t happen because water movement out, as a cell is\nsqueezed and pressurized by gravity, is balanced by water movement in due to purity (the\nlow water purity inside is because of solutes, Chapter 24). To summarize: plant cells with- CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 45\nout lignin resist the force of gravity because is incompressible (high compressive strength)\nand is located within a selectively permeable membrane surrounded by a cell wall with\ntensile strength.\nThis structural feature is demonstrated in wilting plants. Deprived of a supply of water,\nmany plants are unable to resist the force of gravity and to maintain their structure. The\ncells, mostly with only primary cell walls (no lignin) in and of themselves cannot resist\ncompression, they need water, and if re-watered a wilted plant will once again stand up\nagainst gravity Fig. 9). Woody plants, at least the woody parts of woody plants as well as\nsome herbaceous plants do not wilt because they have cells with secondary walls contain-\ning lignin that provides the compressive strength to resist the forces of gravity.\nFFiigg.. 99 WWiilltteedd ppllaannttss..

The yielding of cell wall\nis both elastic (the wall yields, but returns to its original form when the force, internal\npressure, is eliminated) and also plastic (the wall yields but does not return to its original\nshape if the internal pressure is reduced). Because cell walls are present even in newly cre-\nated cells, plastic deformation is essential for cellular growth.\nConsidering a tree trunk being pushed by the wind, the windward side needs tensile\nstrength, the lee side needs compressive strength. Woody stems are almost entirely com-\nposed of lignified cells that have both tensile strength from the cellulose and compressive\nstrength from the lignin. Such a composite material is comparable to \u2018reinforced\u2019 concrete\n(concrete poured around wire/steel rods) or fiberglass (resin poured around glass fibers),\nwhere the matrix of concrete/resin provides compressive strength and the fibers of wire/\nglass provides the tensile strength. Moreover, the lignin in plant cells was deposited while\nthe cellulose was under tension, because the cell was pressurized when the lignin was\ndeposited in the secondary cell wall. This produces a composite material like pre-stressed\nconcrete, a concrete made by pouring concrete around steel cables that are under ten-\nsion. Pre-stressed concrete has superior strength when compared to regular reinforced\nconcrete. Finally, a tree trunk blown by the wind not only has to have structurally strong\ncells, the cells need also to stick to each other because separations between cells will cause\nstructural failure, and indeed when stems break or lumber fails it is both because of sepa-\nrations between individual cells and also failures within individual cells.\nBBoouunnddaarriieess aanndd oorrggaanniissmm mmoovveemmeenntt\nOrganisms move by manipulating their boundaries relative to the environment. For\nfamiliar organisms (lions and tigers and bears) this is done with appendages (legs, fins,\ntentacles) whose positions are manipulated internally. This is comparable to the move-\nment brought about by flagellae and cilia, which are extensions of the boundary of cells\nthat often provide motility to unicellular organisms, including most of the groups covered\nhere: most archaea (e.g. Halobacterium), most bacteria (e.g. Agrobacterium, Rhizobium), eug-\nlenoids (e.g. Euglena), dinoflagellates (e.g. Gonyaulax), cryptomonads, some of the green\nalgae (e.g. Chlamydomonas). Flagellae and flagellar motility is commonly found in the\nreproductive cells (e.g. sperm, zoospores) of most multicellular organisms, and, as consid-\nered in Chapter 2, these cells might be considered organisms. Thus flagellated mobility\nis near ubiquitous, lacking only in a few groups, all of them \u2018inanimate\u2019, being absent in CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 47\nall red algae, all flowering plants (and almost all seed plants), almost all fungi (except in\nsome Chytrids), and almost all diatoms.\nBut there are other means of movement and the diversity of organisms that we cover\nillustrate a diversity of movement mechanisms, all of which, like flagellar movement, are\nrelated to manipulation of boundaries. Some examples are given below:\nFlagellar motility\nCytoplasmic streaming\nLike amoebae, the amoeboid cells of cellular slime molds move by pushing and pulling on\ntheir boundary by means of microtubules, keeping the volume of the beast constant while\nchanging its form. This allows them to move through their environment or to flow around\na particular food item. Plasmodial slime molds, though much bigger and multi nucleate,\nare able to move in a similar manner. Their cytosol is seen to stream back and forth but\nmore so in one direction, propelling the organism in the direction of greater flow.\nEuglena motion\nOrganisms in the Euglena group can move by both flagellar movement and by a move-\nment that involves reshaping their form, comparable to an amoeba or slime mold.\nGrowth\nFungi and plants move by growing, which requires the extension of boundaries into new\nterritory. This process will be covered later but it requires the extension of individual\ncells, accomplished by the pressure inside these cells exceeding the tensile strength of the\ncell wall and also exceeding the resistance to movement provided by the medium that they\nare moving through (e.g., soil).\nStomatal movement\nVascular plants and a few non-vascular plants have the ability to change the shape of pairs\nof cells (guard cells) in the skin tissue of (generally) leaves, thereby opening pores (stom- 48 | CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES\nata) in the leaf surface. This is accomplished by means of changing hydration levels of\ncells, thereby changing their pressure and shape and in turn opening a hole in between\nthem. Stomatal movement ties into two topics of this chapter: (1) the change in shape\nin guard cells is a consequence of asymmetric deposition cellulose microfibrils in the cell\nwalls, (2) the opening of stomates dramatically changes the dermal permeability to carbon\ndioxide and water, allowing water to escape the leaf and carbon dioxide to enter.\nLeaflet/organ movement\nIn addition to moving by growing, a number of plants are able to move appendages, usu-\nally leaves. This is accomplished in a manner similar to the operation of stomates: by\nchanging hydration levels of specific cells and groups of cells, thereby changing their pres-\nsure and volume and in turn changing their shape. In flowering plants, the changes in\ncellular shape happen in special cells at pivot points that allow leaves to move. In mosses,\nchanges in cellular shape happen in all the cells of the \u2018leaves\u2019 (microphylls) , sometimes\ncausing them to twist and curl up next to the main axis of the moss. Most mosses also pos-\nsess appendages called peristome teeth at the end of the spore-producing capsule. Changes\nin the hydration of the cells in these teeth change their shape, which allows the capsule\nto close in times of high humidity, when spores are less likely to be dispersed, and open\nin times of low humidity, when spores are more likely to be dispersed. Although not a\nboundary movement, a similar mechanism and motion happens with groups of cells called\nelaters that are present in the sporangia (containers where spores are produced) of horse-\ntails and liverworts and whose movement aids in the dispersal of spores.\n\u2018Explosive\u2019 movements\nMentioned earlier was the fact that as cells absorb water and expand, the change in size\nmay be elastic, in which case energy is being stored in the wall; this energy can be uti-\nlized to cause movement. Such an energy storage and a resultant movement is signifi-\ncant in spore and seed dispersal. A container, which may be a cell (e.g. the basidium of\nclub fungi (Basidiomycota) or may be a container with a wall of dermal cells (the fruit of\ndwarf mistletoe or squirting cucumber, both flowering plants) becomes pressurized and\nstores energy in the wall(s). Then a part of the wall(s) breaks open and the pressure is\nrapidly released, expelling the contents (spores or seeds). A similar phenomenon occurs\nin Pilobolus, a bread mold (Zygomycota) except that what is expelled is the whole spore CHAPTER 3: BOUNDARIES | 49\ncontainer (sporangium), occasionally with other organisms hitching a ride. Dehydration\ncan also result in movement. Cells in the fruit wall of some fruits (e.g., witch-hazel) and\nalso in the spore containers (sporangia) of many ferns dehydrate as the fruits/sporangia\nmature. Dehydration results in shrinkage that is resisted by the cohesive strength of water\nbound to cell wall materials. More and more force builds up as more and more water is\nlost. Eventually the force exceeds the cohesive strength of the water in the walls of the\ncells, again causing the structure to rupture. This is often accompanied with an extremely\nrapid change in the form of the fruit/ spore capsule that can result in the forceful release\nof seeds/ spores, like a catapult.\nBBoouunnddaarriieess aanndd ccoommmmuunniiccaattiioonn//sseennssaattiioonn\nA final point about boundaries is that they play a role in the sensation of the environment\nand communication between organisms. Organisms need to sense their environment,\nwhich means that either signals need to get through the boundary or alternatively that\nthere exists a sensor molecule that extends through the boundary and allows a molecular\ninteraction outside to cause a response inside. Both of these things happen. It is also the\ncase that important signals are actively transported out of organisms and that some sig-\nnals are components of the boundaries (e.g. cell wall compounds, or derivatives of enzy-\nmatic action on cell wall compounds). A great example of this is the communication\nbetween Rhizobium, a nitrogen fixing bacteria and the plants they associate with.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cSquirting Cucumber: The Plant That Explodes\u201d by Animalogic.

Without going outside this planet one can come up with a much more\ndiverse set of organisms, as I hope this chapter demonstrates. Organisms vary from each\nother in multiple ways but in this chapter, I will focus on three aspects, two of which,\nsize and form, are very straightforward, but the third aspect, composition, is less famil-\niar. These characteristics have been shaped by evolution, and evidence of convergence\n(unrelated groups converging on a common form) and divergence (related groups show-\ning a variety of forms) abound. Consequently, although form, size and composition are\nextremely important to an organism\u2019s biology, they are remarkably poor indicators of\nphylogeny. This makes attempting to characterize the form of larger taxonomic entities\n(class, order, phylum) challenging, if not impossible. Composition, size, and shape are\ninterrelated and significant to other aspects of an organism\u2019s biology. Moreover, they are\nalso often dynamic, changing during the existence of an organism.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Composition\n\u25e6 Unicellular\n\u25e6 Multicellular\n\u25e6 Colonial\n\u25e6 Coenocytic\n\u2022 Size\n\u2022 Size and shape considerations\n\u2022 Organism shape: spheres, flatten ed, cylinders 52 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nFig. 1 Add to the Star Wars bar scene???

A later chapter\nwill consider composition in chemical and molecular terms. In this chapter \u2019composition\u2019\nrefers to an organism\u2019s cellular nature. Most would agree that all organisms are made of\ncells, but is it one cell or many? And are the cells all the same or do they differ? And are\nthe cells \u2018typical\u2019 in their organization? Here are four composition types, two of which are\nvery familiar, and two of which are less so:\n\u2022 unicellular organisms \u2014 the organism is a single uninucleate cell\n\u2022 multicellular organisms (\u2018complex multicellularity\u2019) \u2014 the organism is made of\nmultiple (usually many) cells but the cells are different shapes and have a specific\norganized arrangement that involves tissues and organs\n\u2022 colonial composition (\u2018simple multicellularity\u2019)\u2014 the organism is made of multiple\ncells but the cells are generally similar in size and shape with no obvious tissues and\norgans\n\u2022 coenocytic composition \u2014 the organism is made of \u2018atypical\u2019 cells, atypical in that CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 53\nthey have multiple nuclei, sometimes thousands of them. The entire organism is\nsometimes just a single cell that has many nuclei, or it may be composed of multiple\nunits, that might be called cells, except that they are generally larger than normal\nand have multiple nuclei.\nUnicellular Organisms\nIn spite of the fact that plants and animals, the two groups\nof organisms that most people are familiar with, are multi-\ncellular, unicellular composition is by far the most common\ntype of organism. Clearly it is a successful way for an organ-\nism to be constructed and most of the \u2018living\u2019 that happens\non earth is a consequence of unicellular life. As will be\ndemonstrated by the examples of unicells that are covered\nhere, there is a tremendous diversity in unicellular organ-\nisms.\nUnicellular organisms are NOT always simple in form and\nfunction. They may be very elaborate in form e.g.,\ndiatoms and dinoflagellates (Fig. 2). While any cell is a com-\nplex entity, there are many unicellular organisms with com-\nponents functionally analogous to the (multicellular) organs\nof more familiar organisms. For instance, Euglena cells pos-\nsess a remarkable amount of internal organization, including FFiigg.. 22 DDiinnooflflaaggeellllaattee\norganelles (eye spot, contractile vacuole) that perform func-\ntions covered by whole organs (eye, kidney) in multicellular organisms. Also, Euglena (Fig.\n3) (along with many bacteria and unicellular algae) can move as a result of coordinated\nre-positioning of extensions that are not multicellular legs, wings or fins but rather an\nextension of the cell, called a flagellum; additionally, Euglena and other unicellular organ-\nisms can also move by altering the form of the cellular body, comparable to what earth-\nworms do, but, unlike earthworms, it happens without the aid of muscles and other\ntissues.\nMost organisms go through a stage or stages that is/are unicellular (e.g., spore, gamete,\nzygote) and these unicells, many of which can be considered organisms because they are\noften distinct spatially and temporally, are often very elaborate in structure and func- 54 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nFFiigg.. 33 EEuugglleennaa\ntion. Examples that will be discussed later are the sperm of multiple groups of plants (e.g.,\nferns, mosses), often referred to as a spermatozoids (Fig. 4). CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 55\nAlthough being unicellular is rightfully\nconsidered a primitive condition, yeasts\nare unicellular fungi and demonstrate that\nthe unicellular condition can sometimes\n\u2018reappear\u2019 in a lineage that previously had\nsome other type of composition, i.e., that\nunicellularity is sometimes a \u2018derived\u2019 con-\ndition. The vast majority of fungi are colo-\nnial/multicellular but yeasts have\nappeared independently multiple times in\nseveral different fungal groups and they\ndo NOT represent the primitive condi-\ntion. In many yeasts the unicellular\ngrowth habit is tied to environmental\nconditions and the organism can be\ninduced to grow in a colonial matter by\nadjusting conditions.\nFFiigg.. 44 TThhee ssppeerrmmaattoozzooiidd ooff aa lliivveerrwwoorrtt..\nColonial Organisms\nColonies of cells (colonial organisms) can\nform two ways. The less common way is\nfor individual cells to come together to\nform a colony. This behavior has evolved\nmultiple times, several times in the bacte-\nria (in groups described as \u2018social bacte-\nria\u2019) and also in the cellular slime molds\nlike Dictyostelium. (Fig. 5) Colonies pro-\nFFiigg.. 55 SSlluugg aanndd ssppoorrooccaarrpp ffoorrmmss ooff tthhee duced this way will contain cells that are\ncceelllluullaarr sslliimmee mmoolldd DDiiccttyyoosstteelliiuumm..\nnot necessarily all the same genetically.\nThe second and far more common way to\nform a colony is a result of repeated cell divisions where the daughter cells adhere to their\nparent. For a cell with a cell wall, the adhesion between daughter cells is accomplished 56 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nwith an adhesive layer deposited between the new cell walls that are produced during cell\ndivision (cytokinesis).\nIn colonial organisms, repeated cell divisions\nproduce an organism with many cells attached\nto each other but the cells are all (or almost all)\nidentical. This type of composition is some-\ntimes described as \u2018simple multicellularity\u2019 or\n\u2018plurocellularity\u2019 that is distinguished from\n\u2018true multicellularity\u2019 or \u2018complex multicellu-\nrity\u2019, or sometimes just \u2018multicellularity\u2019 by a\nvariable set of criteria that usually include cel-\nlular differentiation and the production of tis-\nsues (more on this in the next chapter). A wide\nvariety of colonial forms are possible and result\nfrom the patterns in the planes of cell division.\nFor example filaments (Fig. 6) are formed if the\nplane of cell division is always the same, pro-\nducing a chain of cells connected top to bot-\ntom.\nFFiigg.. 66 BBrraanncchheedd,, fifillaammeennttoouuss ggrroowwtthh iinn\ntthhee bbrroowwnn aallggaaee EEccttooccaarrppuuss\nFilaments can grow from the basal end (if\nthe original cell continues to divide but\nthe daughter cells do NOT divide) or it\ncan grow from the tip (if the original cell\ndoes NOT divide and the daughter cells\nrepeatedly do divide) or it can grow\nthroughout the filament.

It also is present\nin some of the non-vascular plants: all of the hornworts and some of the liverworts (Fig.\n11) , where it is present in the haploid (gamete-forming) form but not the diploid, (spore\nproducing) form (see Chapter 13). Spherical colonies are occasionally found, particularly\nin the green algae.\nThe advantages of colonial growth, i.e., of having cells aggregate or having daughter cells\nremain attached to parental cells, may be different in different situations. One advan-\ntage is size; it allows for much larger organisms than a single cell, and larger size is some-\ntimes, but not always, advantageous. As discussed below, size affects interactions between CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 59\nFFiigg.. 1100 TThhee fifillaammeennttoouuss ggrroowwtthh ooff ffuunnggii ccoonnssiissttss ooff uunniicceelllluullaarr fifillaammeennttss\n((hhyypphhaaee))..\norganisms and their environment. Colonial growth may be successful because it allows\nfor exploration of the habitat: an organism in a marginal habitat may be sustained as it\nexplores for greener pastures. The larger size of colonies makes possible the exploitation\nof different habitats/regions. For example, algae are able to exploit both a substrate (for\nattachment) and the water column (for light and nutrients). Most workers feel that colo-\nnial growth (simple multicellularity) is a step on the way to complex multicellularity, but\nthe abundance of highly successful (i.e., diverse and plentiful) colonial forms indicate that\ncolonial growth is itself an advantageous composition type.\nCoenocytic Organisms\nProbably the least familiar composition type is coenocytic, where the organism\u2019s cells, or\nsometimes its single cell, is multinucleate. This results from repeated nuclear cell divisions\nthat are unaccompanied by splitting of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). Part of the signifi-\ncance of the coenocytic condition has to do with size.

Coenocytic cells are usually large and some-\ntimes extraordinarily so. An extreme case is found in the plasmodial slime molds (e.g.,\nPhysarum), an amoeba-like organism that consists of a single wall-less cell that may be as\nmuch as a meter in length with hundreds of thousands of nuclei (Fig. 12). The form of\nslime molds is dynamic, owing to the ability of the cytoplasm to flow in channels inside\nthe single cell, thereby allowing the organism to explore its environment, engulf food, and\neven climb up over obstacles. Unlike wall-less plasmodial slime molds, coenocytic organ-\nisms with walls can produce specific, permanent forms, but not the way that form is typ-\nically created in multicellular organisms (adding cells to create a form), but instead as a\nresult of the creation of shape in individual large cell(s). The bread molds (Rhizopus). pro-\nduce rhizoids, stolons and stalked reproductive structures, all formed out of a single cell\nwith multiple nuclei (Fig. 13).\nSimilarly, the notorious invasive green algae Caulerpa, can appear very plant-like, i.e., with\n\u2018stem and leaves \u2019, but it\u2019s remarkable size and complexity occurs without recourse to cells\nand tissues.

The \u2018fungal\u2019 structure of hyphae and\nmycelium that is cellular (i.e., colonial) in the sac fungi (Ascomycota) and club fungi\n(Basidiomycota) is coenocytic in the bread molds (Zygomycota) and the mycorrhizal\nforming Glomeromycota. And this same fungal-like coenocytic form is found in a non-\nfungus group, the water molds, e.g., the plant pathogen Phytophthora. The structure of\nwater molds explains why the group used to be placed in fungal phylum and also why\ngrouping things by \u2018looks\u2019, i.e., form, is dangerous! Water molds are now placed in a group\nthat includes brown algae and coccolithophores, two groups that are not at all fungal like\nnor coenocytic.\nMany would not consider these coenocytic organisms to be unicellular, even though tech-\nnically many are. They are closer to a colonial organism. If one defines organ as a compo-\nnent of an organism that provides a particular function (e.g., anchorage, elevation) then\nit is apparent that organs can be formed in both colonial and coenocytic organisms (Fig.\n14), in both cases without the presence of specialized cells and tissues. 62 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nFFiigg.. 1133 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff tthhee ssttrruuccttuurree ooff tthhee bbrreeaadd mmoolldd RRhhiizzooppuuss,, sshhoowwiinngg rrhhiizzooiiddss,,\nssttoolloonnss aanndd ssppoorraannggiioopphhoorreess..

These tiny organisms are FFiigg.. 1155 EEsscchheerriicchhiiaa ccoollii bbaacctteerriiaall cceellllss\nusually shaped as spheres, rods or spirals.\nAlthough most prokaryotic cells range from 0.5 to 10 um, there are a few giant prokary-\notes whose cells might be up to 500 um in length, meaning that they can be seen with the\nnaked eye, albeit as a speck. 64 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nUnicellular eukaryotes possess cells with nuclei and other cellular organelles. They are\ngenerally bigger (10-100 um) than prokaryotes although there are a number of unicellular\neukaryotes with small cells, in particular the yeasts (unicellular fungi, generally with cells\nless than 10 um). The fact that unicellular organisms are almost always small in size is gen-\nerally thought to be a consequence of the need for nuclear control of cellular activity:\nlarger size is difficult because in large cells messages (mRNA, proteins) moving by diffu-\nsion take too long to get from the \u2018control center\u2019 (the nucleus, the ribosome) to all parts\nof the cell. This idea is supported by the following observations:\n\u2022 coenocytic cells, which have multiple nuclei, are often much larger than cells with a\nsingle nucleus\n\u2022 larger unicells often exhibit cytoplasmic streaming which provides for more rapid\nmovement of signals throughout the cell\n\u2022 larger unicells (found in plants, fungi and algae) possess a large central vacuole that\ntakes up much of the cell\u2019s volume and that is in some ways a metabolic \u2018dead space\u2019\nthat is relatively inactive (or at least not as dynamic as the cytosol); consequently,\nthe amount of cytosol that the nucleus must \u2018control\u2019 is actually much smaller than\nappears based on cell size\nThere are a few extremely large unicellular organisms, Acetabularia, (Fig. 16) standing up\nto 5 cm tall, being one of them. Acetabularia is unique not just for its size but also because\nit demonstrates that \u2018organs\u2019 (\u2018rhizoids\u2019, \u2018stems\u2019, \u2018leaves\u2019) are possible even in organisms\nthat are unicellular. Acetabularia cells are over 1000 times larger than typical eukaryotic\ncells, with maximum dimensions of over 50,000 um (= 50 mm = 5 cm).\n[Other large unicells e.g., bread mold (Rhizopus), Physarum (plasmodial slime mold) are\ncoenocytic and the case could be made that they really should not be considered unicellu-\nlar.]\nMost organisms over 100 um in size are colonial, coenocytic or multicellular. While the\ncells of coenocytic organism vary greatly in size, the cells of colonial and multicellular\norganisms are commonly 10 \u2013 100 um in their maximum dimension and the organism\u2019s\noverall size is determined by how many cells are produced/accumulate. Some of the par-\nticularly large organisms that we will consider are: redwoods, up to 85 m in height and\nweighing an estimated 2100 metric tons (= 2100 * 103 kg = 4620 * 103 pounds = 2310 tons);\ngiant kelp (brown algae) up to 50 m in length; \u2018Pando\u2019, a clone of trembling aspen that CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 65\nFFiigg.. 1166 AAcceettaabbuullaarriiaa aarree aammoonngg tthhee llaarrggeesstt uunniicceelllluullaarr//\nuunniinnuucclleeaattee oorrggaanniissmmss,, ssttaannddiinngg uupp ttoo 55 ccmm ttaallll aanndd wwiitthh aa\nwweellll--ddeefifinneedd ssttrruuccttuurree\nweighs over 6 million kg, extends over 43 hectares and may have an age of 80,000 years\n(more in the discussion of Populus); and a honey mushroom (Armillaria) that extends over\n4 square miles (1000 hectares), weighs an estimated 55,000 kg and is considered to be 2400\nyears old.\nSize and shape\u2014influence on surface area & interactions\nwith the environment\nSize and shape are particularly significant because they dictate the degree of interaction\nbetween the organism and the outside environment. Appreciate that the conditions inside\norganisms are different from those on the outside; this is part of what defines life. The 66 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nFFiigg.. 1177 AA cclloonnee ooff aassppeenn,, aallll ccoonnnneecctteedd bbeellooww ggrroouunndd,, eexxtteennddiinngg sseevveerraall hheeccttaarreess..\nsecond law of thermodynamics (which we will consider in Chapter 24) dictates that dif-\nferences between the inside and the outside diminish with time: if some chemical is con-\ncentrated inside an organism it will tend to leak out; if something is excluded from an\norganism it will tend to leak in; if an organism is warmer than its environment it will\ncool; if an organism is cooler than its environment it will warm. Whatever conditions an\norganism develops to promote its life functions will tend to disappear because the sec-\nond law dictates that systems change to develop uniformity, i.e., there is a tendency for\nthe inside to become more like the outside. Given this, one might think that having little\ninteraction with the external environment is \u2018best\u2019. However, interaction with the envi-\nronment is essential: (1) to obtain materials \u2014 food, oxygen, minerals\u2014that are needed\nto maintain life, and (2) to rid the organism of \u2018materials\u2019 that it produces, e.g. heat and\ncarbon dioxide, that will bring it harm if allowed to accumulate. The size and form of an\norganism control how it interacts with the environment that it is in. Significantly, size\nand form affect two important parameters that are related but not exactly the same thing,\nthe surface area of contact with the environment and the volume of the environment in CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 67\nproximity with the organism. Both of these parameters are important in controlling the\ninteraction between the organism and its environment.\nThe significance of surface area is familiar idea. M ore surface area allows for more inter-\naction with the environment, which may or may not be beneficial. For any shape, smaller\nobjects always have a greater surface area per unit volume than large objects (Table 1).\nTable 1. Influence of size on surface area: volume ratios for spheres, cubes and cylinders\nwith heights ten times longer than the radius.\nsurface surface area:\nvolume\nshape dimension (in arbitrary units) r = area volume\nradius,s = side (units3)\n(units2) (units-1)\nsphere r = 0.1 units 0.004 0.126 31.5\nsphere r = 1.0 units 4.19 12.6 3.01\nsphere r = 10 units 4190 1257 0.3\ncube s = 0.1 units 0.001 0.06 60\ncube s =1.0 units 1 6 6\ncube s = 10 units 1000 600 0.6\ncylinder r = 0.1, height = 10 x r 0.314 0.691 22\ncylinder r= 1.0, height = 10 x r 3.14 69.1 2.20\ncylinder r= 10, height = 10 x r 31.4 6911 0.22\nformulae sphere: volume = 4/3 (pi) (r)3; surface area = 4 (pi) (r)2\ncube: volume = (s)3; surface area = 6 (s)2 68 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\ncylinder: volume = height (pi) (r)2; surface area = 2 (pi) (r) (height) + 2 (pi) (r)2\nKeeping volume constant, a sphere has the minimum surface area of any shape, and depar-\ntures from an isodiametric shape increases the surface area and thus the surface area: vol-\nume ratio (Table 2). If one compares the surface area of two common shapes, \u2018filaments\u2019\n(elongated in one dimension) and \u2018sheets\u2019 (elongated in two dimensions) while keeping\nthe volume constant, the degree of elongation increases the surface area, and elongation\nin two dimensions has a greater effect than elongation in one dimension (Table 3).\nTable 2.

Because smaller objects have relatively\nmore surface area than larger ones, smaller organisms heat up more quickly than larger\nones. In fact, because of effective heat exchange between them and their environment,\nsmall organisms are always very close to the same temperature as their environment. Only\nlarge organisms, with a small surface area to volume ratio, can develop temperatures sub-\nstantially different from their environment. Considering shape, spher ical bodies, with\nthe least surface area per unit volume, heat more slowly than any other shape when put\nin an environment that is hotter than it; the more deviation from a spher ical shape the\nfaster it will gain heat.

Assuming equal volumes for ice cubes, the best ice cubes, if you want them\nto last (not melt), are spherical ones, the best ice cubes if you want them to cool the drink\nthat they are in, are shapes that deviate the most from spheres\nA second influence of form: the extent of environment that\nis explored\nAn often-overlooked fact is that organ-\nisms change their environment around\nthem. In the example just given, the trans-\nfer of heat to the cell results in a cooling\nof the environment adjacent to cell. The\ncooling of the environment next to the\ncell will reduce the gain of heat by the\norganism and diminish the significance of\nFFiigg.. 1188 TTwwoo sspphheerriiccaall oorrggaanniissmmss wwiitthh tthhee\nssaammee vvoolluummee aanndd ssuurrffaaccee aarreeaass bbuutt tthhee surface area to heat transfer. Because of\nddiiffffeerreenntt ffoorrmm ccaauusseess tthheeiirr iinntteerraaccttiioonnss wwiitthh this, a second characteristic related to\ntthhee eennvviirroonnmmeenntt ttoo ddiiffffeerr..\nform becomes important: the volume of\nthe environment that is within some dis-\ntance (the distance depends characteristics of transfer) of the organism. To see why, con-\nsider two spherical organisms with a cylindrical \u2018distortions\u2019 of their otherwise spherical\nboundary: one has an \u2018outie\u2019 (a projection that extends outward), the other has an \u2018innie\u2019\n(an invagination that penetrates into the organism) (Fig. 18).\nAs long as the dimensions of the projection / invagination are the same, both the cells will\nhave the same surface area, yet the heat exchange between the \u2018outie\u2019 cell will be faster\nthan that from an \u2018innie\u2019cell. This is because the conditions of the environment inside the\n\u2018innie\u2019 projection will become more similar to those of the organism than to the condi-\ntions of the bulk environment outside of the cell. The volume of \u2018the environment\u2019 that\nis in the \u2018innie\u2019 is small and the surface area between the innie and the cell is relatively\nlarge, consequently as the \u2018innie\u2019 part of the environment loses its heat to the cell it would\nbecome less and less significant a source of heat. Thus, the additional surface area result-\ning from the \u2018innie\u2019 would become of little consequence in terms of interacting with the\nenvironment. In contrast, the additional surface area of the \u2018outie\u2019 can remain more effec-\ntive in facilitating heat transfer because this area is surrounded by the environment, not CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 71\nthe cell. Hence surface area by itself is not always the best measure of how much interac-\ntion an organism (or object) might have with its environment.\nA consequence of this is that form is important in influenc ing the transfer of materials\nbetween the organism and the environment in two ways: (1) by determining surface area\nof a given volume of organism, and (2) by influencing the volume of the environment that\nis in close contact with the cell. Although an \u2018innie\u2019 does increase surface area, this does\nlittle to influence the volume of environment close to a cell; an \u2018outie\u2019 does much more.\nThe significance of how much of an environmental volume is explored depends on several\nfactors including the rate at which heat or material is conducted through the environ-\nment and the rate at which heat or material can be transferred from the environment to\nthe organism. If the environment transfers heat or material readily, or if the rate of trans-\nfer into the cell is slow, the importance of how much environment is explored is of less\nimportance.\nConsider another example of two cells with\nthe same number of multiple outies, exten-\nsions outward, and the same surface areas.\nOne has the outies close together, the other\nhas them spaced out (Fig. 19). The cell with\nspaced out extensions explores more of the\nenvironment than the other and will be able\nFFiigg.. 1199 TTwwoo oorrggaanniissmmss\nto acquire more heat or material from its environment (or lose wwiitthh tthhee ssaammee vvoolluummee\naanndd ssuurrffaaccee aarreeaa bbuutt\nmore heat or material to its environment), especially if the rate\nwwhhiicchh ddiiffffeerr iinn tthheeiirr\nat which heat or materials move through the environment is rel-\niinntteerraaccttiioonnss wwiitthh tthheeiirr\natively slow, or the rate at which they are absorbed/lost is rela- eennvviirroonnmmeenntt..\ntively fast. A parameter can be calculated that is the volume of\nenvironment within some distance of the cell surface; outies that are close to each other\nare less effective in increasing the amount of environment being \u2018accessible\u2019 than are more\nseparated outies.\nSome (perhaps) familiar situations demonstrate the importance of form and some of\nthe complications related to it. The microvillae, small projections of small intestine that\nextend out into the gut track, are often cited as being important in the absorption of\nmaterials from the gut because they provide increased surface area. This is certainly the\ncase but it should also be pointed out that the movement of material through the gut\ntrack, a result of peristalsis, is what allows the additional surface area to be significant. 72 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nWithout peristalsis continually bringing \u2018fresh\u2019 material to the dense stand of microvillae,\nthe increased surface area would be of little utility. Peristalsis changes the environment\nnext to the microvillae. Root hairs, cylindrical extensions from the cells on the outside of\nroots, are another situation where increased surface area is cited as being significant to\nthe water absorption function of roots. This may not always be the case, especially when\nthe root hairs are extremely dense and if water is abundant, which allows it to move more\nreadily through the soil. However, roots and root hairs don\u2019t just absorb water, they also\nacquire nutrients and the impact of root hairs may be different for different nutrients\ncompared to the impact for water. Moreover, the conductivity of the soil to water and\nminerals is very strongly affected by how much water is present, a very dynamic property\nfor most soils. Root hairs probably do multiple things that are significant for absorption\nof water and minerals: (1) increase surface area, (2) increase the volume of soil in close\nproximity to the root, (3) improve contact between the root and the soil by preventing\ngaps (air spaces) which would drastically reduce absorption of water and nutrients, (4)\nperform metabolic functions that facilitate nutrient absorption, e.g., active transport.\nSShhaappeess ooff OOrrggaanniissmmss\nWhile there are a wide variety of shapes of organisms, three common forms are cylinders,\nsheets and spheres. Many organisms are composites of different shapes, i.e., they have\nsome pieces that are one shape and other pieces that are another shape, e.g., many animals\nhave cylindrical appendages attached to a spherical core. Most above-ground plants are\ncomposed of flattened sheets (leaves) attached to cylindrical stems. Both the above-\nground and below-ground form of plants typically are filaments that branch repeatedly, a\nform that is also found in fungi. Common forms for the organisms covered in this text are\noutlined in the Table 4.\nSpheres\nAs mentioned above, spheres have a minimum surface area per unit volume. Assuming\nthat there is a specialized boundary on the outside of the object, be it unicellular or mul-\nticellular, a sphere would require the minimum amount of boundary, which often is com-\nposed of relatively expensive materials. Spherical shapes are also more mobile in many\nsituations owing to their reduced drag, which in general increases with surface area. While\nthere are a number of roughly spherical animals, spherical multicellular organisms from CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 73\nTable 4.\nshape examples notes\nlow surface area to volume ratio\nmany unicellular organisms, some and small amount of environmental\nspheres\ncolonial and multicellular ones volume explored per unit of\norganism\nmany colonial and multicellular algae\nhigh surface area to volume ratio,\nincluding sea lettuce (Ulva) and kelp\nflattened often significant for photosynthetic\n(Laminaria) ; the haploid form of all\norganisms to absorb more light\nhornworts and many liverworts\nboth a high surface area to volume\ncylinders most fungi, many green and red algae,\nratio and potentially a large\n(branched or some bacteria, the roots of vascular\namount of environmental volume\nunbranched) plants\nexplored per unit of organism\nsome macroalgae (red, brown and the appendages typically are\ncylinder with\ngreen); most plants\u2013including most flattened and photosynthetic and\n(non-cylindric)\nmosses, many liverworts and almost all their shape increases the amount of\nappendages\nvascular plants surface area exposed to light\nother groups, in particular the groups we are covering, are uncommon. However, the form\nis commonly found organisms that are unicellular: many bacteria, many unicellular green\nalgae, dinoflagellates, cryptophytes and coccolithophores are roughly spherical in shape\nand the shape occasionally occurs in colonial organisms (some green algae). Spheres are\nalso common in dispersal units: pollen, seeds, spores, all of which are entities that might\nbe considered organisms. And spherical shapes are also a common shape for the structures\n(organs) that contain elements to be dispersed: sporangia (spore containers), fruits (seed\ncontainers), anthers (pollen containers). The advantage(s) of spherical shapes no doubt\nvaries on circumstances and may also reflect other constraints on development. In rare\noccasions, round shaped seeds, fruits and even whole plants may aid in the dispersal of\npropagules by wind and gravity. A whole-plant example of the this is the tumbleweed,\nwhose spherical shape promotes the dispersal by the wind of the seeds which are released\nfrom the rolling plant. Spherical forms are typical of the (usually underground) storage\norgans of flowering plants: corms, bulbs and tubers and this is probably a consequence of\nsurface area to volume considerations. 74 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nFlattened structures\nFlattened structures are especially common in photosynthetic organisms, undoubtably\nbecause of the importance of intercepting light. While it is often stated that flattened\nshapes \u2018intercept more sunlight\u2019 than other shapes (e.g., maple leaves vs. pine needles), this\nis misleading; similar amounts of light can be acquired given any particular shape. What\nis significant is how much volume is required to produce a given area of light absorbing\nsurface, and also how much total surface area is required. Table 5 compares morphologi-\ncal characteristics for three different leaf shapes: cubes, sheets and filaments. In each sit-\nuation the assumption is made that one \u2018face\u2019 of the shape is facing the light source and\nthat light absorption only occurs on this surface. As can be seen the same amount of light\ncould be intercepted by ten cuboidal leaves, each 10 x 10 x 10 cm in size, or ten filamentous\nleaves, each 100 x 1 x 1 cm or by ten planar leaves 10 x 10 x 1 cm. While both filaments and\nplanar leaves can produce the same amount of absorbing surface per unit volume of leaf,\ncuboidal leaves \u2018cost\u2019 much more (illuminated area: total volume) (Table 5). The difference\nbetween filamentous leaves and planar leaves is that planar leaves reduce the total surface\narea required to produce a given amount of absorptive surface. It is probably these two\nfactors that are significant in ensuring that light absorbing surfaces are generally planar:\nthick leaves require volume that cannot be used effectively for photosynthesis; filamen-\ntous leaves produce excess total surface area which may be costly in terms of other factors,\ne.g., water loss for terrestrial organisms.\nThe flattened structure may be the entire organism (some green, red and brown algae,\nsome liverworts (including Marchantia, hornworts) or, most commonly, the flattened\nstructures occur as leaves / leaf-like structures off of a cylindrical stem.\nTable 5.\nnumber total total sur- illuminated area illuminated\nshape dimensions\nof leaves volume face area / total area area / volume\ncuboidal 10 10 x 10 x 10 10000 6000 1 / 6 1: 100\nfilamentous 10 100 x 1 x 1 1000 4020 1 / 4.02 1: 1\nplanar 10 10 x 10 x 1 1000 2400 1: 2.4 1: 1 CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE | 75\nThe above treatment is superficial and some complicating factors should be noted: light\nis usually not only absorbed by one surface of any structure as the sun\u2019s position changes\nduring the day and season; light penetrates through a surface to layers below; although\nmost leaves move only minor amounts during the day or season, some leaves change posi-\ntion to \u2018track\u2019 the sun; and some leaves change position to reduce solar exposure. And, in\nspite of the trend of generally planar light absorbing surfaces, there are multiple exam-\nples of filamentous \u2018leaves\u2019(e.g. conifer needles, asparagus branches) and also examples of\nspherical \u2018leaves.\u2019\nA planar shape is also sometimes found in propagules, the dispersal stages of organisms,\nwhere the flattened \u2018wing\u2019 aids in dispersal in the air. Interestingly, wings are primarily\nfound in relatively large propagules, the seeds and fruits of seed plants, with dimensions\ngreater than a few millimeters. \u2018Wings\u2019 are uncommon in aquatic organisms and in small\npropagules: e.g., spores and pollen. Although most conifer pollen has two \u2018wings\u2019, they are\nnot particularly flattened and, in spite of the fact that conifers are wind pollinated, the\nrole of the wings may not be to aid in dispersal but rather to orient the pollen grain after\nit has been dispersed.\nCylindrical structures\nCylindrical structures are extremely common, both as parts of organism and as the whole\norganism. Cylindrical unicellular organisms are found in rod-shaped bacteria and archaea;\nfilamentous colonial forms are represented by some bacteria, many cyanobacteria, colo-\nnial diatoms, many green algae and some red and brown algae. For most of these colonial\norganisms, the filaments are all one cell thick, but, especially in the red and brown algae,\nthe filaments may be thicker, often several cells thick. There are many coenocytic green\nalgae that are filamentous. 76 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nFFiigg.. 2200 CCyylliinnddrriiccaall ffoorrmm iinn fifillaammeennttoouuss\nggrreeeenn aallggaaee..

Root hairs are also extensions of individual cells. The rhizoids of mosses,\nliverworts and hornworts are usually a filament made up of a string of individual cells.\nHoldfasts of macroalgae are made up of thousands of cells and the roots of vascular\nplants are multicellular and made up of multiple tissues with multiple cell types.\nCylinders with non-cylindrical appendages\nCylinders also function to position organs in favorable locations, e.g., the stem of plants\nor the stipe of the larger algae, distributing flattened leaves/leaf-like structures in order\nto obtain more light. The vast majority of plants, ranging from mosses, most liverworts\nand all vascular plants , have an above-ground structure that can be described as a \u2018stem\nwith leaves\u2019. Typically, the cylindrical stem branches and is erect but sometimes it is\nunbranched and sometimes it is prostrate, running along the ground surface. 78 | CHAPTER 4: ORGANISM FORM: COMPOSITION, SIZE, AND SHAPE\nPhytopthora, a water mold, is a parasite that grows inside plant leaves and produces\nbranched structures that emerge from the leaf through stomates, regulated pores in the\nleaf surface, and form cylindric, branched structures that produce and release reproduc-\ntive structures.\nCylinders (stalks) also repeatedly serve to elevate structures that are producing propagules\n(mobile reproductive structures) and thereby facilitate dispersal of propagules. The ubiq-\nuity of the structure reflects the structure\u2019s significance in multiple situations over quite\na range of size s: from stalks as short as 1 micron in myxobacteria, to 1 millimeter in\nslime molds, to 1 centimeter in mosses, to meters in height in vascular plants. The cylin-\ndrical stalks can be parts of a cell (bread molds, some slime molds), made of a single\nfilament of cells (fungi), a collection of intertwining filaments (fungi) or truly multicel-\nlular (some fungi, mosses, vascular plants). Generally, such structures are found in terres-\ntrial organisms with stalks that carry propagule-producing-structures upward into the air.\nEven a very short upward extension can enhance dispersal by allowing the propagules to\nbe released above the most sedentary part of the boundary layer, the layer of still air that\nblankets all objects, and in particular the ground. Apparently, such structures are not as\nadvantageous in aquatic situations because they are much less common. In some situa-\ntions, a stalk is significant not by moving the propagule-producing-structure up (relative\nto gravity) but because it moves the structure outside of the organism\u2019s own body or out-\nside the body that it is growing inside of (e.g., fungi, some parasites).\nAs the last example demonstrates, cylinders are significant to a number of organisms as a\nmeans of mobility, to arrive at new places. Although most of the organisms that we study\nare considered immobile, they are capable of movement that is due to growth, and a cylin-\nder is an effective structure to cover territory. Examples include: horizontally running\nabove ground stems (stolons) and below ground stems (rhizomes) of plants, the \u2018stolons\u2019\nof bread molds, rhizomorphs of fungi, horizontal \u2018runners\u2019 in Caulerpa, a green alga.\nFFuurrtthheerr RReeaaddiinngg aanndd VViieewwiinngg\nThe first six deal with the question of multicellularity; the last with fungal structure.\n\u2022 \u201cFungi took a unique evolutionary route to multicellularity: Seven key\nchallenges for fungal multicellular life\u201d by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G.

But people had observed cells before (fish eggs, frogs\u2019 eggs, birds\u2019 eggs). What\nwas significant about Hooke\u2019s observation was that he noted that organisms, at least some\nof them, were composed of smaller entities that he called cells. He was able to see them\nin part because he was using the recently developed microscope. But what also made the\ncells visible were that they were plant cells, cells that not only are larger than most ani-\nmals cells but also have cell walls that outline each cell, are rigid and do not collapse when\nthe material is cut into thin sections. The material he was looking at was cork, the outer\nbark of a tree, and what he was obser ving was the remnants of cells that were no longer\nalive; their existence was preserved because of their thick and persistent cell walls (Fig. 1).\nWhile Hooke\u2019s observations illustrated\nthat at least some parts of some organisms\nwere composed of smaller units, the gen-\neralizat ion that all organisms were com-\nposed of one to many \u2018fundamental units\u2019,\ncells, was not to be fully realized for\nanother 200 years when \u2018cell theory\u2019 was\nproposed and championed. Although peo-\nple were very aware of fish eggs and frog\neggs, they had not appreciated that when\nthe eggs turned into tadpoles the material\nwas first divided up into many, many\nFFiigg.. 11 RRoobbeerrtt HHooookkee\u2019\u2019ss ddrraawwiinngg ooff tthhee cceellllss ooff small units, each with the same basic con-\nccoorrkk ppuubblliisshheedd iinn tthhee bbooookk MMiiccrrooggrraapphhiiaa,,\nstruction.

These are arranged in a particular way to produce a complex\nwhole, a frog embryo. Think of making castles out of legos. A similar transformation\noccurs as the fertilized egg of plants transforms into a plant embryo, although the egg cell CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE | 83\nof plants (about 20 um) is 100 times smaller than those of frogs and about five times\nsmaller than those of humans.\nOne of the great themes of biology is the unity and diversity of life: how organisms can\nsimultaneously be so similar and so different. The same concept also applies to cells and is\nfundamental to \u2018cell theory\u2019: living things are made up of cells, whose basic organization,\nchemical composition and organization is similar; but these cells are also diverse in terms\nof shape and function and the diversity is seen both between different organisms (plant\ncells are different from animal cells) but also within (multicellular) organisms.\nDiversity of cells within an organism is one, and for some people the only, criterion for\na multicellular organism, not simply that they are made of multiple cells but that at least\nsome of the cells differ from one another. Before describing the diversity of cell types\nfound in some of the organisms that we cover, we will consider additional criteria that\nmight be used to define multicellularity.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Multicellularity\n\u2022 Cell Structure of Fungi\n\u25e6 Chytrids\n\u25e6 Coenocytic, filamentous fungi \u2014 bread molds and Glomeromycota\n\u25e6 Septate fungi \u2014 Club and sac fungi\n\u2022 Cell Structure in water molds\n\u2022 Cell structure in algae\n\u25e6 Brown algae\n\u25e6 Red Algae\n\u25e6 Green algae 84 | CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE\nMMuullttiicceelllluullaarriittyy\nCan a unicellular organism be multicellu-\nlar? One might think that this is absurd, yet\nit can be true, depending on definitions. An\nillustrative case is the Apicomplexa, a group\nthat includes is the causal organism for\nmalaria, Plasmodium. Members of this group\nare always unicellular but have multiple cell\ntypes (Fig. 2), cells that look different,\nbehave differently and live in different\nplaces. Most biologists would not consider\nthe Apicomplexa to be multicellular and\nwould rather consider it as a biological\nentity with multiple forms, but in a devel-\nopmental sense it raises the same question\nthat multicellularity poses: if one cell is FFiigg.. 22 DDiiffffeerreenntt cceellll ttyyppeess ffoorrmm bbyy\nPPllaassmmooddiiuumm..\nidentical genetically to another cell, how\ncan they end up looking and behaving dif-\nferently?\nIf you study the life cycle of Plasmodium carefully you will note that some of the cellular\ndiversity is associated with reproduction and the sexual process, a topic that will be dealt\nwith in more detail later but for now simply note that most organisms produce differ-\nent cells that are associated with reproduction and/or sex. Chlamydomonas, a unicellular\ngreen algae (Fig. 3) , produces bi-flagellate cells that all look and behave alike except for:\n(1) some cells look different because they lose their flagellae and divide twice to produce\nfour cells while still within the parental cell. Eventually the parental cell wall is digested\nand the four typical-looking cells are released, (2) some cells look normal but are \u2018special\u2019,\nfunctionally different, because they are able to fuse with other \u2018special cells\u2019. Cells become\n\u2018special\u2019 because of changing conditions, e.g., nutrients become less available. (3) the cell\nformed by the fusion of two special cells develops into a very different looking cell, one\nwith no flagellae and a thick cell wall. It also functions differently, because it is metabol-\nically inactive. Eventually it becomes active and divides to produce four typical looking\n(bi-flagellate) daughter cells that are released after the cell wall is digested and weakened.\nThese three atypical cell types are associated with sex and the process of meiosis (Fig 3, CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE | 85\nright-hand side of the diagram) will discussed in more detail later, along with a consider-\nation of reproduction (left-hand side of Fig 3).\nFFiigg.. 33 SSeexxuuaall ((oonn tthhee rriigghhtt)) aanndd aasseexxuuaall ((oonn tthhee lleefftt)) rreepprroodduuccttiioonn iinn tthhee uunniicceelllluullaarr ggrreeeenn\naallggaaee CChhllaammyyddoommoonnaass..\nObviously very few would consider unicellular organisms like Plasmodium or Chlamy-\ndomonas to be multicellular in spite of the fact that they may exhibit multiple cell types.\nThe point is that the possession of different-looking or different-behaving cells (e.g., egg,\nsperm, zygote, spore) that are associated with the reproductive or sexual process are not\nsufficient to label an organism as multicellular. This is trivially true for unicellular organ-\nisms but is also true for colonial organisms that are made up of multiple cells that are\nalmost all the same and is the reason for the distinction between \u2018simple multicellularity\u2019\nand \u2018complex multicellularity\u2019. 86 | CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE\nConsider the filamentous green algae\nUlothrix, (Fig. 4) which exists as strings of\ncells, most of which all look alike (see the\ncenter part of the drawing labelled \u2018a\u2019), but\nsometimes some of the cells transform\n(i.e., develop) to produce mobile cells that\nhave four flagellae (\u2018c\u2019 in the diagram) and\nare released from the filament. These cells\nFFiigg.. 44 CCeellll ttyyppeess iinn UUllootthhrriixx,, aa fifillaammeennttoouuss can establish new filaments by attaching\nggrreeeenn aallggaaee..\nto a substrate and dividing to produce\nnew filament (\u2018d\u2019). Other cells transform\nand produce and later release cells with only two flagella (\u2018f\u2019). These cells must find\nanother bi-flagellated cell, fuse with it (\u2018g\u2019), then undergo meiosis to form four quadrifla-\ngellate cells (\u2018h\u2019) that can attach to a substrate and form new filaments.\nAnother example of simple multicellularity with diverse cell types associated with repro-\nduction and sex is found in Oedogonium, (Fig. 5) another filamentous green alga. Most cells\nare cylindric with lengths about five times longer than their width. But there are also egg\ncells that are shorter and bulge in the middle, and there are much shorter sperm produc-\ning cells, with lengths the same or shorter than their width. Both these cell types develop\nholes in their walls that allows the short cells to release mobile sperm and allows the\nsperm to enter into the egg cells, resulting in the production of cell with genetic infor-\nmation from two parents. This develops into a dormant spore (zygospore) that is eventu-\nally released from the filament. An additional cell type can develop from the normal cells\nas they develop flagellae and eventually are released from the filament as cells capable of\nforming new individuals.\nFFiigg.. 55 CCeellll ttyyppeess iinn OOeeddooggoonniiuumm.. CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE | 87\nThese examples demonstrate common cell types associated sex and reproduction and\nfound in organisms with colonial growth (showing \u2018simple multicellularity\u2019): (1) cells that\nare capable of fusing with each other, called gametes that are sometimes differentiated\ninto egg and sperm, (2) zygote, a cell formed by the fusion of gametes, (3) zoospores, fla-\ngellated cells specialized for mobility (dispersal in space) (e.g. the cell labelled \u2018c\u2019 in the\nUlothrix diagram), (4) inactive, dormant cells that allow for dispersal in time. In general,\nthese are called spores (but note that zoospores are NOT inactive). These inactive cells\nare called endospores in bacteria and akinetes in cyanobacteria. In a number of organisms\n(e.g., Chlamydomonas, Oedogonium, bread mold) spores develop from zygotes and are called\nzygospores. We will see a number of different types of spores in the fungi.\nTo repeat, none of the examples consid-\nered so far would be considered multicel-\nlular even though they produce multiple\ncells, some of which are very different\nstructurally and functionally from others.\nWhat additional features contribute to\nthe case for \u2018true multicellularity\u2019? One\nfeature is mutual dependency. Most of the\ncells of Anabena, a cyanobacteria, have\nchlorophyll and photosynthesize to feed\nthemselves. Anabena also produces cells\ncalled heterocysts that lack chlorophyll\nand are unable to photosynthesize. They\nare \u2018fed\u2019 by adjacent, \u2018regular\u2019 cells. Hete-\nrocysts are significant because they can\ntake dinitrogen gas, a form of nitrogen\nthat \u2018regular\u2019 cells cannot utilize, and con-\nvert it into a form that the regular cells\ncan utilize (more details in Chapter 22).\nHence, the heterocysts and the regular\ncells depend on each other. At least some\nFFiigg.. 66 AAnnaabbeennaa,, ((aa ccyyaannoobbaacctteerriiuumm)) workers would consider the dependency\nfifillaammeennttss,, tthhee cclleeaarr cceellllss aarree hheetteerrooccyyssttss tthhaatt of one cell type on another to be a crite-\n\u2018\u2018fifixx\u2019\u2019 nniittrrooggeenn aanndd mmaakkee iitt aavvaaiillaabbllee ttoo ootthheerr\nrion that makes Anabena multicellular.\ncceellllss\nAnother feature that Anabena demon- 88 | CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE\nstrates and that is significant to the concept of multicellularity is material movement\n(food, nitrogen compounds) between the cells of the organism. This really is a form of\nintercellular communication, and many workers consider intercellular communication\nto be a key requirement defining multicellularity. Features that enhance communication\ninclude trans-cellular connections, plasmodesmata in the case of plants.\nAnother criterion that has been applied to define \u2018true multicellularity\u2019 is a three-dimen-\nsional cellular organization, i.e., not just cells added continuously (without and endpoint,\ni.e. indeterminate development) in one dimension (a filament) or added in two dimen-\nsions (a sheet), or added in three dimensions. True multicellularity to some workers\nrequires a developmental program that produces a distinct three-dimensional form that\nrequires that the size, shape and activities of cells be influenced by a combination of loca-\ntion (where they are in the organism) and where they came from (cellular heritage). Such\na structure requires extensive communication and coordination between cells. Note, how-\never, it does not necessarily require tissues made up of different cell types.\nWorkers who study the evolution of life believe that simple multicellularity (colonies) has\nappeared at least twenty-five times. Complex multicellularity (or what some would call\n\u2018true\u2019 multicellularity), but defined without the requirement of multiple cell types and\ntissues, has evolved at least ten times: once in the group that led to animals, once in the\ngreen algal group that led to plants, once in another green algal group that did not lead\nto plants, twice in the red algae, twice in the brown algae, three times in the fungi, and\nseveral times in the prokaryotes. If the definition of multicellularity requires tissues with\nmultiple cell types (not associated with sex and reproduction) then the number of multi-\ncellular groups is much reduced: just animals, plants and a very few fungi.\nThe cellular structure of select groups of inanimate organisms, organisms that might be\nconsidered multicellular, is described below. Excluded are the vascular plants; these are\nconsidered in the next chapter.\nCCeelllluullaarr SSttrruuccttuurree iinn FFuunnggii\nWhile many biologists characterize the fungal group as being \u2018multicellular\u2019, many clearly\nare not. Three fungal groups are coenocytic and none of these are easily characterized as\nbeing multicellular. And unicellular fungi, which exist in several fungal groups, would cer-\ntainly not be considered multicellular. The fungi that might be considered as possessing CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE | 89\ncomplex multicellularity do so for only a small portion of their existence and only in a\nsmall portion of their structure. Almost all fungi produce a filamentous structure, a hypha\n(plural hyphae), that is not multicellular and most fungi are better described as being\ncolonial, a filamentous organism with no specialization of cells whatsoever. In three of the\nfungal groups the hyphae lack cross walls and are coenocytic but the two largest groups\nof fungi do produce cross-walls (Fig 7) and exhibit simple multicellularity. Hyphae grow\nfrom the tip and can bifurcate to branch in two. Branching can also occasionally occur\naway from the tip. Hyphae may also fuse with one another, thereby producing an anas-\ntomosing structure. The network of hyphae thus formed is termed a mycelium. The typ-\nical mycelium is a feeding structure with a dynamic (growing and dying simultaneously),\ndiffuse, form that is well suited to obtain nutrients: it possesses both a great deal of sur-\nface area for absorption and it also penetrates a large environmental volume, allowing it\nto \u2018mine\u2019 a substrate for nutrients. The feeding mycelium is the digestive system of fungi\nand simultaneously serves as: (1) a structure to digest food, (2) a \u2018small intestine\u2019 to absorb\nnutrients (3) a circulatory system to move nutrients to other parts of the fungus and ulti-\nmately to reproductive structures. Note that none of these functions are associated with\nspecific cell types, tissues or organs.\nFFiigg.. 77 IIlllluussttrraattiioonn ooff sseeppttaattee ffuunnggaall hhyypphhaaee..

These\nare called septa (singular septum) and they only partially seal off cells because they are\nperforated by pores that are large enough to allow many materials (ribosomes, mitochon-\ndria and sometimes nuclei) to move from one cell to another. Thus, the composition of\nthese fungi is in between coenocytic and cellular. The cellular structure of specific groups\nof fungi are described below.\nChytrids\nThe fungal group considered most primitive (probably better described as the group that\ndiverged at the earliest time from the rest of fungi) are the Chytridiomycota (chytrids).\nChytrids are small aquatic organisms, both marine and freshwater, with some existing\nin the film of water surrounding soil particles. Most are microscopic, usually the size\nof a typical unicellular organism (less than 100 um). They may be truly unicellular (one\nnucleus) or coenocytic (multiple nuclei). Many produce forms that are roughly spherical.\nSeveral chytrids form what are called rhizoids, root-like extensions off of the main body\nthat attach them to a source of nutrition, often pollen, the spores of other organisms, or a\nsingle cell of a living or dead multicellular organism. Besides attachment, the rhizoids also\nserve to increase surface area and allow for more effective digestion and absorption. A few\nchytrids form filaments (hyphae) that occasionally branch to form a very small mycelium.\nThe group is distinguished from all other fungi by having flagellated, mobile, spores.\nCoenocytic, filamentous fungi\nTwo additional fungal groups, the bread molds (Zygomycota) and the Glomeromycota,\nare substantially bigger than chytrids and produce a coenocytic hyphae and form mycelia.\nWhile both these groups lack specific cell types, some do form specific structures which\none might term organs, except that they are parts of cells, not composed of cells. For\nmany bread molds these structures, stolons, rhizoids and sporangiophores, are relatively\nlarge and can be seen with the naked eye. In the Glomeromycota the \u2018organs\u2019 are much\nsmaller structures, but again are parts of cells, not cells. The Glomeromycota are the\nfungi that, together with plants, form endomycorrhizae, associations between plant roots\nand fungi. In endomycorrhizae, the fungus penetrates individual root cells (\u2018endo\u2019 means\ninside) and inside these cells the fungus form two structures, tree-like arbuscules and\nspherical vesicles (endomycorrhizal fungi are sometimes called vesicular-arbuscular myc- CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE | 91\norrhizae or simply VA mycorrhizae). These structures are extensions off of the coenocytic\nhyphae. Arbuscules are structures with some similarities to the the rhizoids of chytrids.\nThey serve no anchorage role but are significant in increasing the area of contact between\nthe fungus and the plant, thereby allowing for greater material movement between them.\nVesicles are spherical bodies that are thought to store materials for the fungus and which\nmay develop into spores.\nSeptate fungi\u2014Club and Sac Fungi\nThe two largest groups of fungi, club fungi (Basidiomycota) and sac fungi (Ascomycota)\nare not coenocytic. They produce hyphae that are septate, with cross walls to delineate\nindividual cells. As the growing tip of a hypha extends, nuclear divisions (mitosis) are\ncoordinated with the cellular divisions (cytokinesis) that produce new cross walls with\na substantial pore. These cross walls are oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the\nhypha. As a result, new cells, each with a nucleus, are sequentially produced at the tip as it\ngrows. The tip cell is also capable of occasionally dividing in a manner to cause the tip to\nbifurcate, to split in two, forming a branch. Branching sometimes also occurs away from\nthe tip, the result of an outgrowth from a previously formed cell.\nUnder certain conditions the hyphae of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota may also form\nmuch more compact mycelia, usually associated with reproduction, and some of which\napproach in form structures that are more typical of multicellular organisms. These struc-\ntures may range in organization from an amorphous mass of compact hyphae (aka a dense\nmycelium), termed a stroma, in which \u2018fruiting bodies\u2019 (spore producing structures) are\nformed (see tar-spot disease), to much more defined and determinate structure such as a\ntypical mushroom with a stalk and cap. The stalk generally serves to enhance the dispersal\nof spores that are produced in the cap. Most of the organisms that produce mushrooms\nare club fungi (Basidiomycota) but a few are cup fungi (Ascomycota), and both groups\nproduce fruiting structures that are not at all mushroom-like (e.g. bracket fungi). Both\ngroups produce a wide variety of fruiting body forms, all developing as a result of pat-\ntern of growth of multiple hyphae. Although these structures are clearly organized and\nproduce a consistent (determinate) three-dimensional final form, they generally show lit-\ntle evidence of tissues or specialized cell types, except those directly associated to sexual\nreproduction. 92 | CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE\nAnother dense, compact hyphal structure produced by septate fungi is called a fungal\ncord or a rhizomorph. It consists of a multiple hyphae running parallel and glued to each\nother, forming a thread that may be several millimeters in diameter (cf. to a fungal hypha\nwhich typically is ten-times smaller in diameter than a human hair). Rhizomorphs are the\nresult of repeated hyphal branching at very low angles to the orientation of the parent\nhyphae, consequently allowing the branch to stay closely associated and fused with the\nhypha that produced it. The result is a structure with little capacity to feed (or lose water)\nwhen compared to a diffuse mycelium, because of its reduced surface area and reduced\npenetration of its environment. But the rhizomorph is specialized for mobility and allows\nthe fungus to traverse low-nutrient space or environmentally hostile (e.g., dry) space and\npotentially arrive in a more favorable location. When and if the rhizomorph arrives in\na nutrient rich zone the growth form reverts to a diffuse mycelium suited for nutrient\nabsorption. The extension of rhizomorphs requires transport of nutrients in order to feed\nthe tips of hyphae (where growth is occurring) using nutrients that are being acquired at\nsome distance from the tip. This transport function is served by specialized, large diam-\neter hyphae, analogous to tubes found in brown algae and vascular plants. Another spe-\ncialized cell type found in rhizomorphs, and located toward the outside of them, are thick\nwalled \u2018sheathing hyphae\u2019 that have a structure again similar to some cells (fibers) found\nin vascular plants. These give the rhizomorph structural integrity and make it is less likely\nto be severed, something that is of much more consequence to a rhizomorph than to an\nindividual hypha.\nA few fungi produce structures called sclerotia, again a dense mass of hyphae, but sclerotia\noften develop into distinct forms and sometimes show specialization between a hard\nouter \u2018rind\u2019 and inner cells. The cells on the interior often have substantial food reserves\nand sclerotia are typically overwintering structures, structures that can become dormant.\nThe stored food allows the sclerotium, which is sometimes dispersed, to survive the win-\nter and resume growth when favorable conditions return.\nCCeelllluullaarr SSttrruuccttuurree ooff WWaatteerr MMoollddss\nThe water molds, or Oomycota are similar in form to the bread molds (Zygomycota) with\nboth groups being composed of coenocytic filaments, hyphae, that collectively form a\nmycelium but show no cellular specialization other than cells associated with reproduc-\ntion. The group includes some important plant pathogens, including late blight of potato,\nsudden oak death syndrome and \u2018damping off\u2019 diseases. In spite of the name, they aren\u2019t CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE | 93\nmolds (fungi) and many are terrestrial not aquatic (although the representative of the\ngroup that is most commonly seen, at least if you have an aquarium, is a white fuzz occur-\nring on dead fish). Water molds were once grouped with the fungi because of morphology\nbut they are now considered to be in the heterokont grouping that also includes brown\nalgae and diatoms.\nCCeelllluullaarr SSttrruuccttuurree ooff CCeelllluullaarr SSlliimmee MMoollddss\nDuring the unicellular part of cellular slime mold\u2019s existence there obviously is no cellular\ndifferentiation, but when aggregation occurs the cells acquire different fates and one\nmight consider this to be reflective of complex multicellularity. In particular, and of\nevolutionary significance, only some cells of the aggregate ultimately end up producing\nreproductive cells. Other cells, e.g., the cells in the stalk of the spore producing structure,\ncontribute to reproductive success by elevating the spore producing structure but gain no\nevolutionary advantage for \u2018doing a good job\u2019 since they are not necessarily represented in\nthe next generation. This is in contrast to the more normal situation in multicellularity\nwhere all the cells of a multicellular organism are derivatives (and hence share a genetic\ncomposition) with the original \u2018starter cell\u2019, typically a zygote or a spore. Because of their\nunusual path to multicellularity, the determinators of cell fate in cellular slime molds is\nan area of active study. There are no obvious visual/structural differences between the\ncells of the slug or the fruiting structure but their positions are different, some are on the\noutside, some inside; some are near the front, some are behind. And position appears to\nbe important in determining cell fate, including the position at the time of aggregation.\nMoreover, there is strong evidence that cell fate and \u2018knowledge\u2019 of position is a result\nof communication via chemical signals, one of the criteria that workers consider to be a\ndefining aspect of complex multicellularity.\nCCeelllluullaarr SSttrruuccttuurree ooff AAllggaaee\nAlgae are an artificial grouping of aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms whose\nclassification remains in some flux. Many algae are unicellular or are colonial (\u2018simple mul-\nticellularity\u2019) and do not show any cellular specialization except for cells associated with\nsex and reproduction. Most of these organisms are small: microscopic, or barely visible to\nthe naked eye. But there are three groups of algae, colorfully named the red algae, brown\nalgae and green algae, that include forms that are described as \u2018macroalgae\u2019. They are large 94 | CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE\n(i.e., not microscopic, generally at least 0.1 m in extent) and with an organized structure,\noften consisting of organs: cylindric stems and branches, flattened blades, air sacs, root-\nlike holdfasts and other features. Almost all of the brown algae and most of the red algae\ncould be described this way. This \u2018macro\u2019 form is proportionately less common in the\ngreen algae where many members are smaller and where a considerable number of forms\nare unicellular or colonial (filaments). Using the more lenient definitions of multicellu-\nlarity, most macroalgae would be considered multicellular. Using more restrictive defin-\nitions, in particular requiring intercellular connections and communication that allows\nfor cooperation between cells, substantially reduces the number of macroalgae that are\nconsidered \u2018truly multicellular\u2019. Nonetheless, it appears that rigidly defined complex mul-\nticellularity has evolved independently at least two times in each of the three macroalgae\ngroups (along with three times in the fungi, one time in animals and twice in bacteria).\nBrown algae\nThis group used to be considered a phylum but now is considered as an entity further\ndown the taxonomic scale (a class, or a family, or a level in between). While almost all\nbrown algae are macroalgae, many lack cellular differentiation and an obvious tissue orga-\nnization. The structure is basically filamentous, with the filaments branching and inter-\nacting with each other to form a distinct structure, similar to the way that certain fungi\nproduce mushrooms out of hyphae. It appears that \u2018true\u2019 multicellularity, with the pres-\nence of cellular differentiation and tissues, has evolved twice in this group, once in a line\nthat includes rockweed (Fucus) and once in a line that includes giant kelp (Laminaria).\nIn both these groups there are distinct organs (holdfast, stipe, blade, air bladders) along\nwith some cellular and tissue differentiation; in particular, there are cells specialized to\nallow for the long-distance movement of carbohydrates throughout the organism. These\ncells are analogous (not homologous!) with transport cells of vascular plants and have sim-\nilar features: they are elongate cells with large diameters and with multiple trans-cellular\ncytoplasmic connections between adjacent cells. Another distinct cell type, also analogous\nwith what is found in vascular plants, are cells with thickened cell walls that provide for\nstructural integrity, allowing a large organism to hold together in spite of being pushed\nand pulled by ocean currents and/or waves. CHAPTER 5: CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN INANIMATE LIFE | 95\nRed Algae\nThe red algae group has roughly four times the number of species as the brown algae\nand is more diverse in terms of morphology. A substantial number are macroalgae with\na definite organized structure. As was the case in fungi and some brown algae, their\nthree-dimensional complexity is a consequence of the growth and interactions of multiple\nfilaments. Tissues can be described in some forms, with the cylindrical portions (\u2018stems\u2019)\nhaving distinct outer and inner layers and possessing cells distinguished by their size and\npigmentation. Some red algae are crust forming (\u2018crustose\u2019) and exist as a coating on the\nsurface of various substrates. In many crustose forms there is a layered organization, with\nthe filaments next to the substrate having different cells from those above. Some of the\ncrustose red algae develop a layer of dividing cells near the top surface whose action allows\nthe crust to thicken and also allows for the development of reproductive structures.\nGreen Algae\nOf the three algal groups that include macroalgae, the green algae group is by far the\nlargest (15,000 species), with many unicellular, simple filamentous and other colonial\nforms. Consequently, the macroalgae are a much smaller portion of the total species.\nSome of the macroalgae are siphonaceous, often composed of multinucleate filaments that\ninteract to form a three-dimensional form. Most modern (cladistic) phylogenies divide\nthe green algae into two groups, one of which, in addition to including (some) green algae,\ncontains all of the organisms considered plants. Both groups exhibit a variety of forms,\nincluding some macroalgae with \u2018complex\u2019 multicellularity, showing three-dimensional\ngrowth, cellular connections and distinct cell types. Some of the green macroalgae (e.g.\nCaulerpa) are siphonaceous, producing a large complex form out of many large, multinu-\ncleate cells.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cAre mushrooms the new plastic?\u201d by Eden Bayer.

All plants are considered \u2018truly\nmulticellular\u2019 although there are some\nmembers with very little cellular special-\nization and only very rudimentary tissue\nand organ structure (Fig. 1). The majority\nof plants, and the ones that most people\nobserve, are \u2018vascular plants\u2019, a mono-\nphyletic group whose name refers to par-\nticular cell types and tissues that they\npossess. The remaining plants, non-vascu-\nlar plants (mosses, liverworts and horn- FFiigg.. 11 AA hhoorrnnwwoorrtt,, aa ppllaanntt wwhhoossee ssiimmppllee\nssttrruuccttuurree iiss ddeessccrriibbeedd aass aa tthhaalllluuss aanndd sshhoowwss\nworts), are often put together in a group.\nvveerryy lliittttllee oorrggaanniizzeedd ssttrruuccttuurree..\nHowever, grouping organisms on the\nbasis of what they lack is generally not useful in a phylogenetic sense and it certainly is\nnot in this case: non-vascular plants do not form a \u2018natural grouping\u2019. Moreover, none of\nthe three groups appears to be more closely affiliated with vascular plants than the oth-\ners. Thus, the plant group is best separated into four units (generally put at the phylum\nlevel): mosses, liverworts, hornworts and vascular plants. Mosses, liverworts and horn-\nworts are all small, often less than a centimeter in height, but they can extend over a\nconsiderable area. They do vary in form and exhibit three basic body plans that do not\nfollow the phylogenetic groupings. These are delineated below.\nNon-vascular plants, and all plants, alternate between two stages: a haploid, gamete pro-\nducing form (gametophyte) and a diploid, spore producing form (sporophyte) (Chapter\n11). In all of the non-vascular plants the gametophytes are much more likely to be 98 | CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS\nencountered because of their greater size and longevity. When present, sporophytes often\nappear to be an appendage of the gametophyte which, in a structural sense, they are. For\nvascular plants it is the sporophyte plant that is dominant (much larger on longer lived)\nand the gametophyte stage will only be considered briefly here but will be described\nmore fully when considering sex and reproduction (Chapters 13 and 14).\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Non-vascular plant gametophyte structure\n\u25e6 Simple thalloid forms\n\u25e6 Complex thalloid forms\n\u25e6 \u2018 Stem and leaf\u2019 forms\n\u2022 Non-vascular plant sporophytes\n\u2022 Vascular plant sporophyte structure\n\u25e6 Organs, tissues and cell types\n\u25e6 specialized organs\n\u25e6 special cell types\nGGaammeettoopphhyytteess ooff nnoonn--vvaassccuullaarr ppllaannttss\nSimple thalloid forms\nA thallus refers to a body form that lacks organs and tissues and is relatively amorphous,\noften occurring as a flattened sheet. In all of the hornworts (Fig. 1) and some of the liver-\nworts the form of the gametophyte is a simple sheet of cells, a few cells thick, often thin\nenough so that the thallus is translucent. There is no cellular specialization within the\nthallus, although the lower surface produces unicellular rhizoids that attach the thallus\nto the substrate. These cells lack chlorophyll and therefore must acquire nutrition from\nthe photosynthetic cells above.

Like the previous form there are no\nobvious organs except those associated with sexual or asexual reproduction (see Marchan-\ntia. The thallus consists of flattened sheets that spread over the substrate (soil, rocks or\ntree trunks and branches, leaves) and commonly bifurcates, splitting in two. The thallus\nis often over 20 cells thick and has discernible layers. There is an upper \u2018skin\u2019 (epidermis)\nthat is coated with a cuticle and often is regularly perforated by pores. The pores are\nformed by barrel shaped clusters of cells that span the epidermis and, at least in some\nforms, are capable of closing the pore under dry conditions. Below the epidermis is a\nporous layer of cells, i.e., cells are not tightly packed and have air spaces in between\nthem. Cells of this layer have abundant chloroplasts. Generally, the largest air spaces are\nbelow the por es. The porous nature of the upper thallus is a feature that is also be pre-\nsent in most vascular plant leaves and is significant in allowing carbon dioxide to diffuse\nto photosynthesizing cells. Lower layers of the thallus are less porous and have cells that\nlack chlorophyll. The lower epidermis often produces rhizoids, i.e., some of the cells have 100 | CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS\nthread-like extensions that anchor the organism to the substrate. Structures associated\nwith asexual reproduction (gemmae cups), and structures associated with sexual repro-\nduction (antheridiophores and archegoniophores) are sometimes observed extending\nfrom the upper surface (see Marchantia), their structure and function will be discussed\nlater in the chapter.\nStem and leaf form\nThis is the form found in most mosses and many liverworts. The organism has a cylindri-\ncal \u2018stem\u2019 to which are attached small planar appendages, \u2018leaves\u2019, that are typically two\nmm or less in length and increase the light absorbing area.\nFFiigg.. 33 TThhee \u2018\u2018sstteemm aanndd lleeaaff\u2019\u2019 ffoorrmm ooff\nnneeaarrllyy aallll mmoosssseess aanndd mmaannyy\nlliivveerrwwoorrttss ccoonnssiissttss ooff aa sstteemm uuppoonn\nwwhhiicchh aarree bboorrnn mmuullttiippllee ssmmaallll\n\u2018\u2018lleeaavveess\u2019\u2019..\nThe \u2018leaves\u2019 generally do not have a cuticle and are only one-cell thick, although moss\nleaves commonly are thickened with more cells along their center-line, forming a nerve\n(costa). The stem is often less than 2 mm in diameter and generally shows little cellular\nspecialization. Rarely, in a few moss species there are cells (hydroids) that are specialized\nfor water transport by being elongate and hollow (i.e., the cell has died and the cytosol CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS | 101\nis absent), with openings in their slanted end-walls that allow water movement between\ncells. Similarly, a few mosses possess cells (leptoids) that have features that facilitate car-\nbohydrate transport. Although hydroids and leptoids function in ways similar to cell\ntypes in vascular plants, they lack lignin and are not considered vascular tissue. They rep-\nresent convergent evolution, not a close relationship between vascular plants and the few\nmosses that possess them.\nSimilar to vascular plants (see Chapter 10), the orientation of the stems greatly influences\nthe \u2018look\u2019 of the plant. Most \u2018stem and leaf\u2019 liverworts and many mosses are prostrate,\nrunning basically parallel with the substrate that they are growing on. But many mosses\nhave vertically oriented stems that give them a very different appearance. Also analogous\nto the form of vascular plants, mosses and liverworts vary in branching frequency, with\nsome species showing little or no branching (occurring as single erect stems) and others\nshowing extensive branching.\nFFiigg.. 44 AA mmoossss wwiitthh aa pprroossttrraattee\nggrroowwtthh hhaabbiitt,, wwiitthh sstteemmss rruunnnniinngg\nhhoorriizzoonnttaallllyy aanndd iinnffrreeqquueenntt\nbbrraanncchhiinngg.. 102 | CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS\nFFiigg.. 55 AAnnootthheerr mmoossss llaacckkiinngg vveerrttiiccaall sstteemmss aanndd\nsshhoowwiinngg eexxtteennssiivvee aanndd rreegguullaarr bbrraanncchhiinngg ooff\nccrreeaattiinngg aa ffeerrnn--lliikkee ffoorrmm..\nFFiigg.. 66 \u2018\u2018LLeeaaff aanndd sstteemm\u2019\u2019 ffoorrmm ooff ttwwoo mmoosssseess:: TThhee bbrriigghhtt ggrreeeenn mmoossss iiss\neerreecctt,, uunnbbrraanncchheedd aanndd ssttaannddiinngg 33--44 ccmm iinn hheeiigghh wwiitthh lleeaavveess aallmmoosstt 11 ccmm\nlloonngg..

Although they are sometimes\ngreen and photosynthetic, they have no flattened parts to increase photosynthetic light\nabsorption and must depend on the gametophyte for carbohydrates during some or all of\ntheir existence. In hornworts, the sporophyte is a thin cylinder that splits open longitu-\ndinally, from the tip, to release spores. In liverworts and mosses, the most common\nsporophyte form is a \u2018ball on a stick\u2019, with a roughly spherical spore producing structure\n(sporangium) at the end of a stalk that in most cases serves to elevate the sporangium to\na higher position, presumably to aid in spore dispersal. However, in some liverworts\n(e.g., Marchantia) and mosses (e.g., Sphagnum) it is a structure on the gametophyte that\nactually provides the elevation. The sporangium opens to release spores by splitting\napart (liverworts) or through an opening (mosses) whose size is regulated by teeth that\nmove in response to humidity, closing the opening under humid conditions. In some liv- CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS | 105\nerworts the sporophyte is extremely small and although it is not elevated, its stalk is pro-\nduced in an umbrella shaped organ (the archegoniophore) that is elevated.\nOOrrggaannss,, ttiissssuueess aanndd cceellllss ooff vvaassccuullaarr ppllaannttss\nAlthough non-vascular plants are clearly successful, existing and thriving in most terres-\ntrial habitats, their size and activity is impacted by their limited ability to grow\nupwards. This inability was overcome with the appearance in vascular plants with the\nappearance lignified cell walls that can resist the force of gravity and the appearance of\nvascular tissues possessing cell types that make possible long-distance transport of water\nand carbohydrates. Vascular tissue allowed terrestrial autotrophs to exist as two con-\nnected entities, both essential to the other: a water and nutrient absorbing structure and\na photosynthetic structure. The three organs of vascular plants, roots, stems and leaves,\nreflect the basic biology of terrestrial autotrophs: leaves acquire sunlight and carry out\nphotosynthesis to \u2018feed\u2019 the organism, roots explore the soil and acquire the water and\nnutrients that is required for photosynthesis and growth, and stems connect the photo-\nsynthetic part with the water-and-nutrient acquiring part and also serve to distribute\nleaves effectively in their aerial enviro nment. Each of these three organs possess three\nfundamental tissues: a \u2018skin\u2019 (dermal tissue), transport tissue (vascular tissue), and\nground tissue (everything else, the tissue that fills the spaces between dermal tissue and\nvascular tissue).\nCells of vascular plants show substantially more specialization than is found in non-vas-\ncular plants and multiple cell types have been defined, primarily on the basis of the fol-\nlowing features, summarized in Table 1.\n1. Whether the cell is alive or dead at maturity. A number of plant cell types are sig-\nnificant to organism function only after they have died. In particular, cells impor-\ntant for water transport, for structural integrity (keeping the plant from falling\nover when the wind blows), and for mechanical protection are often dead when\nthey are performing these function s. Obviously, the cell is functioning before it\ndies, but its most significant contributions to the organism as a whole are when it is\ndead. These cells \u2018die young\u2019 as a result of a programmed cell death, i.e., a genetic\nprogram is triggered in these cells that causes it to die \u2018on its own\u2019.

Cell wall characteristics. All plant cells have what is called a primary cell wall\ndescribed in Chapter 3. It is composed of cellulose microfibrils imbedded in a\nmatrix of hemicellulose and pectins, molecules that bind cellulose microfibrils to\neach other and also absorb water, forming a gel. The primary cell wall is present as\nthe cell is growing and when the cell expands the wall is yield ing to the pressures\nthat are present inside the cell. The cell stops growing when the cell wall stiffens\nand no longer yields to the pressures generated inside it. At this point some cells\ndeposit a distinct type of cell wall material, called a secondary cell wall, inside the\nprimary cell wall. Since the cell is not growing, the more secondary cell wall that is\ndeposited, the smaller the space inside the cell wall becomes. When the cell dies,\nthis space, where the cytosol (usually with a large vacuole) used to be, is termed the\nlumen. Like the primary cell wall, the secondary cell wall contains cellulose\nmicrofibrils, but they are imbedded in a matrix of lignin, not hemicellulose and\npectin. Lignin is a complex polymer composed of phenolic subunits. Unlike the pri-\nmary cell wall, the secondary cell wall has substantial compressive strength and\ndoes not need a cell membrane and the pressurization of water inside the cell in CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS | 107\norder for the cell to resist compression (details on this process are discussed in\nChapter 22). Killing plant cells with only primary cell walls drastically affects their\nstructural integrity (cooking spinach dramatically demonstrates the effects of\nkilling plant cells on plant form). A cell with a secondary cell wall is rigid even after\nthe cell has died and the membrane is gone. Corn stems stand erect even after the\nplant is dead because of cells with secondary cell walls. Lignin is the material that\nmakes some plants woody, tough and rigid, but non-woody plants (e.g., corn) may\npossess lignified cells that are important structurally. Plants or plant parts (e.g.,\nspinach and many other leaves) with cells possessing only a primary cell wall are\ncalled herbaceous and are much less resistant to forces produced by gravity or the\nwind. Such plants/plant parts lose all structural integrity if the cell membrane is\ndestroyed or if lost water is not replaced (see Fig 9 in Chapter 3).\n3. Cell shape. Plant cells come in a variety of shapes. Many cells are round or nearly\nso, or rectangular with their long dimension being two to ten times that of the\nshort dimensions. Other cells are very elongate with their long dimension being up\nto 1000 times that of their diameter. Generally, the long axis of cells runs the same\ndirection as the long axis of the plant, i.e., up and down the stem /root.\nThese features are summarized below. Specific cell types will be considered in more\ndetail when considering the functioning of these tissues.\nSpecialized organs of vascular plants\nThe three basic organs of vascular plants are roots, stems and leaves but commonly these\norgans have become specialized for specific functions and do not look \u2018typical\u2019. The most\nreadily observed of these are stems devoted to reproductive structures: the flowers of\nangiosperms and the cones of conifers, clubhouses. Generally these specialized stems have\nspecialized leaves that may or may not be recognized as such. These structures are consid-\nered in more detail in chapter 14 and 15 dealing with reproduction. Stems and also roots\nare often modified to store carbohydrates, with the modification usually involving a sim-\nple enlargement of the structure, e.g. the root of a carrot, the stem of kohlrabi, the leaves\nthat form onion bulbs. Often the specialized structure is produced in a specialized way,\ne.g. potatoes are modified stems but they are produced below ground, onions and cab-\nbage are both round structures formed by densely produced leaves either above ground 108 | CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS\nTable 1.

The changes in shape cause an opening to appear or disappear in the space between\nthe pair of guard cells (discussed in Chapter 22)\nSpores, sperm and egg\nAs introduced in the previous chapter, these cells are associated with sex and reproduc-\ntion. Sometimes they have special structural features, but most significant are their abili-\nties and potentials. They are found in most of the groups considered here and are\nconsidered further in Chapter 11 and other chapters dealing with reproduction and also\nin the organism fact sheets. 112 | CHAPTER 6: ORGAN, TISSUE, AND CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF PLANTS\nFurther Reading and Viewing\nImages of non-vascular plants (\u201cbryophytes\u201d):\n\u2022 Excellent site with many images of bryophytes:\n\u25e6 https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/bryophyte-ecology/\n\u2022 Australian site on bryophytes:\n\u25e6 https://www.anbg.gov.au/bryophyte/index.html\n\u2022 Good discussion and images of liverworts:\n\u25e6 https://www.anbg.gov.au/bryophyte/what-is-liverwort.html\n\u2022 Images of Ohio mosses and lichens:\n\u25e6 https://ohiomosslichen.org/MossID4.html\n\u2022 Images of the mosses and liverworts of Illinois:\n\u25e6 https://www.illinoiswildflowers.info/mosses/\nmoss_index.html#snk_liverwort\n\u2022 Remarkable story of an ancient fossil, prototaxites, that may be a liverwort\nsilurian fossil:\n\u25e6 http://coo.fieldofscience.com/2010/02/prototaxites-giant-that-never-\nwas.html\nWebsites with excellent pictures of seed plant cells and tissues:\n\u2022 University of Texas Austin Mauseth Lab Table of Contents\n\u2022 University of Wisconsin Botany Resources\n\u2022 \u201cSee the Plant Kingdom\u2019s Hidden Microscopic Wonders\u201d by Michael\nGreshko.

Sometimes these changes in the \u2018adult\u2019 organism are dra-\nmatic and end its existence. That is, some organisms \u2018self-destruct\u2019 as part of its develop-\nmental process, just as some cells do. Salmon die after spawning, as do wheat plants. In\nboth cases the endpoint of the developmental process is death. A corollary to this is that\ndevelopment does not just include growth and increases in complexity, it may also\ninclude, and in fact it often ends with, decreases in size and complexity and ultimately\nthe end of the organism (Fig. 6). 118 | CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT\nThe field of development has exploded in\nrecent years and is being examined from\nmolecular and evolutionary perspectives\nin great detail. We are focused at a very\ndifferent level, considering the very basic\ndevelopmental features that bring about\nthe form and structure of the biological\nentities we describe as organisms. We have\ndescribed several different forms of\norganisms: unicellular, simple multicellu- FFiigg.. 66 HHaarrvveessttiinngg wwhheeaatt iinn WWaasshhiinnggttoonn ssttaattee..\nlar (filamentous, sheets), coenocytic, com- TThhee wwhheeaatt hhaass ddiieedd \u2018\u2018ooff iittss oowwnn aaccccoorrdd\u2019\u2019 aass\nppaarrtt ooff iittss oorrggaanniissmmaall ddeevveellooppmmeenntt pprroocceessss..\nplex multicellular. We will briefly\nconsider how each of these forms devel-\nops. An important aspect of development for many organisms is the process of sex, involv-\ning the combining the genetic information of two organisms and subsequently halving it.\nSex and reproduction are considered in Chapter 11.\nDDeevveellooppmmeenntt iinn oorrggaanniissmmss tthhaatt aarree uunniicceelllluullaarr\nA number of organisms under considera-\ntion here (e.g., many bacteria, archaea,\ndiatoms, dinoflagellates, and many green\nalgae) are unicellular and, while their\ndevel opment is quite different than for\nmulticellular organisms, they do change\nover time and show definite patterns of\ndevelopment. Universally, development in\nunicellular organisms has two visible\nmanifestations (there are many more\ndevelopmental events that are not visible):\ncell division (Fig. 7) and cell growth.\nThese processes are components of the\n\u2018cell cycle\u2019, a repeating series where cells\nFFiigg.. 77 DDeevveellooppmmeenntt iinn yyeeaasstt,, aa uunniicceelllluullaarr\noorrggaanniissmm,, iinnvvoollvveess cchhaannggeess tthhaatt bbrriinngg aabboouutt acquire materials, synthesize molecules\nrreepprroodduuccttiioonn ((cceellll ddiivviissiioonn)) bbyy bbuuddddiinngg.. from them, and partition these materials CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT | 119\ninto two daughter cells in the process of mitosis. While the most obvious molecule that\nneeds to be made is DNA, there are a host of others: molecules for membranes, ribosomes\nand (for eukaryotic cells) for mitochondria and plastids. The construction of these mate-\nrials requires that the cell obtain the elements that they are made of: carbon, nitrogen,\nphosphorus, etc. (Chapter 22), and part of the cell cycle involves the acquisition of these\nmaterials and the construction of the requisite molecules.\nThe relationship between cell division and cell growth is not the same in all organisms.\nCells may divide repeatedly without any growth (e.g., in the early development of many\nanimals). In this situation the original cell has plenty of \u2018materials\u2019 and the cell ular\ndivisions simply partition these materials into daughter cells resulting in a multicellular\norganism that is basically the same size as the original fertilized egg. But this cannot go\non forever, eventually there has to be material acquisition, reflected in an increase in mass\nand size (i.e., growth), to allow for continued cell division.\nThe main component of all cells is water and its acquisition is generally what drives cellu-\nlar growth (i.e., expansion in size). For organisms with cell walls, water entry into the cell\nis effected one of two ways: by weakening the cell wall strength or by increasing the con-\ncentration of solutes, leading to an increase in internal pressure. This is discussed more\nin Chapter 24, but for now one should appreciate that both these processes can be con-\ntrolled by cellular activity. Consequently water absorption and cellular growth may occur\nas a distinct phase that occurs before or after other materials are obtained, or it can occur\ngradually. That is, the cell can: (1) grow steadily as both water and other materials are\nobtained; (2) divide, acquire materials other than water while remaining about the same\nsize, and once enough materials other than water have been obtained then rapidly acquire\nwater and grow or (3) divide, grow quickly by absorbing water and show little growth as\nit acquires materials other than water, and then divide again. In the first case there are a\nrange of cell sizes will be observed and the age of a cell is correlated with its size. In the\nsecond case, cells that are about to divide are recognizable because of their large size. In\nthe third, case a population of cells would all be the same size except for some small cells\nthat have just been produced by cell division.\nThe pattern shown by certain unicellular diatoms illustrates additional diverse possibili-\nties. All diatoms are enclosed in a silica shell with two halves; some are structured like a\npetri dish with a circular top half having a diameter slightly larger than that of the bot-\ntom half, allowing it to serve as a cover the bottom. When the cytosol divides (cytokine-\nsis) the top half produces one daughter cell by grow ing a new bottom half and this newly 120 | CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT\nproduced cell is \u2018fully grown\u2019 at its inception, i.e., it shows no growth. This cell, like all\ncells, goes through the G1 and G2 stages and during these stages\u2019 materials are acquired\nand put together into biomolecules that can subsequently be partitioned between two\ndaughter cells, but these phases, although often described as \u2018growth 1\u2019 and \u2018growth 2\u2019 do\nnot involve an increase in cell size. Now consider the second daughter cell, the one that is\nassociated with the old \u2018bottom dish\u2019, the smaller dish. This bottom dish becomes a \u2018top\ndish\u2019 as the cell generates a new bottom half. Like its sister cell it does not grow and it\nends up slightly smaller than the parent cell because the bottom half of the original cell\nhas become the top half of the daughter cell; consequently, this cell is slightly smaller than\nits parent (remember the bottom shell has to fit inside the top shell and hence must be\nsmaller). Thus, after cell division, two cells are produced; one is the same size as the orig-\ninal cell and one is slightly smaller. Growth of individual cells is not occurring. Through\ntime, the mean cell size of the diatom population becomes smaller and smaller until some\ncritical minimum size is reached when sexual reproduction is triggered and results, among\nother things, in cells that are the same size as the original.\nExactly what triggers a cell to divide is a tightly controlled process that has been exten-\nsively studied because of its connection to cancer. But the phenomenon is important in\nother situations as well. F or example, in \u2018algal blooms\u2019, whe re a population of algae starts\nreproducing rapidly, producing very large populations whose existence often has very sig-\nnificant consequences. In both cancer and algal blooms, the importance of control mech-\nanisms, other than nutrients, is indicated by the fact that nutrients alone may not trigger\npopulation/cancer growth: nutrients are necessary but not sufficient for growth and the\ncontrol of the process is not simply that cells divide when they acquire enough materials\nto form a second cell.\nDDeevveellooppmmeenntt ooff cceellll sshhaappee\nPart of the development process, for both unicellular organisms and the cells of multicel-\nlular organisms, involves the acquisition of a characteristic shape. For some cells, growth\nproceeds equally in all dimensions and small cells have a very similar shape to large ones,\nbut for many cells, growth is decidedly different in different directions and this pro-\nduces \u2018adult\u2019 cells with characteristic shapes, distinct from the typically spherical/cuboidal\nshape of the newly produced cells. The attainment of this shape is an important feature\nof their development. For organisms with cell walls the shape of cells is determined by the\nrelative strength of the cell wall in different directions. The cells grow by having an inter- CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT | 121\nnal pressure that exceeds the cohesive strength of the cell wall. The wall yields and cellular\ngrowth occurs. If the strength of the cell wall is uniform then the cell expands uniformly\n(think of a typical balloon). But if the wall has less strength in a particular direction, then\nthe expansion will occur in that direction, think of the specialty balloons that become\nlong and skinny, this is a result of the balloon being much more resistant (higher cohesive\nstrength) to radial expansion than to extension. The strength of cell walls is determined\nby the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils (Chapter 3) and this orientation is deter-\nmined as they are deposited.\nDDeevveellooppmmeenntt iinn oorrggaanniissmmss tthhaatt aarree ccoolloonniiaall\nAn essential aspect to unicellular development is that the daughter cells separate, a result\nof the fact that the junction between the \u2018new\u2019 cell and the \u2018old\u2019 one is weak and can\nbe broken by forces in the environment or by forces that accompany the expansion of\none or both of the daughter cells. If this does not happen cell division brings about an\naccumulation of cells that can drastically affect the functioning of each by changing the\nenvironment that they are exposed to and by changing organism form. Clusters of cells\nare considered colonies exhibiting \u2018simple multicellularity\u2019. They are biological structures\nthat do not nicely fit into the organism category, being somewhere between an organ-\nism and a population. Often colonies have characteristic shapes that develop as a conse-\nquence of patterns of cell division. Three basic patterns, filaments, sheets and spherical\ncolonies, were described in Chapter 4 and result from the control of the plane of cell\ndivision. Each of these patterns has consequences for individual cells and their interaction\nwith the environment. Spherical colonies result in some cells (those in the interior) that\nhave very little contact with their environment, sheets and filaments represent situations\nwhere the colony of cells has more interaction with their environment although never as\nmuch as would be the case if the cells had separated from their parent. While most colo-\nnial organisms are described as indeterminate, producing no specific final endpoint but\ninstead growing to sizes that are dictated by biotic and abiotic conditions, there are some\ncolonies that are determinate, producing a colony with a set number of cells and usually\nwith a specific form. 122 | CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT\nDDeevveellooppmmeenntt iinn oorrggaanniissmmss tthhaatt aarree\nccooeennooccyyttiicc//ssiipphhoonnaacceeoouuss\nThe vast majority of organisms that are\nlarge (a mm or more in length) are made\nof cells that are organized in a particular,\nrepeatable way to produce form, i.e., they\nare multicellular and their development\nfrom a single cell involves the creation of\ncells in particular places to create a form.\nBut there are a few of \u2018large\u2019 organisms\nwhose form is not a consequence of an\naccumulation of cells but rather they are a\nsingle large cell that has developed to con-\nsiderable size. A remarkable example of\nthis type of growth is Acetabularia, a green\nalgae that ranges up to several cm in size\nand is shaped like a parasol. Acetabularia,\nand most organisms that are coenocytic/\nsiphonaceous, possess a cell wall and have\ninternal pressures that develop as a result\nFFiigg.. 88 CCoommpplleexx ffoorrmm iinn ccooeennooccyyttiicc\nof osmotic forces.

Bread mold produces parts (stolons, rhizoids,\nsporangiophores) that are all outgrowths of a single cell and there are developmental con-\ntrols that direct where and when outgrowths are produced and what structure is to be\nformed. Similarly, some siphonaceous green algae (e.g. Caulerpa) are capable of producing\ncomplex and large forms by controlling the form and direction of extensions off of a sin-\ngle cell (Fig. 8). Some siphonaceous colonial forms are partly cellular in their construction:\nin Hydrodictyon individual cells are large (up to a centimeter) and multinucleate but are\njoined together into rings, commonly five or six-membered, to form a polygonal network.

Multicellu-\nlarity requires that an organism produce more than one type of cell. Except in the unusual\ncase of cellular slime molds (Dictyostelium), all the cells of multicellular organisms have the\nsame genetic makeup. This means that there must be control processes that dictate that\nsome cells follow one set of instructions while other cells follow different instructions.\nUnicellular and colonial organisms may have the ability to do this to a limited extent. A\nlthough the majority of cells of these organisms are all the same, they may produce spe-\ncialized cells to effect the sexual process, to carry specialized metabolic functions (e.g., the\nakinetes of cyanobacteria), or to accomplish dispersal. Complex multicellularity requires\nan additional significant feature besides the ability to produce different types of cells:\nthe ability to organize multiple cell types in a three-dimensional pattern to form tissues,\nwith tissues organized to form organs, and with the organs organized to form organisms.\nThis organization requires a developmental process that dictates what types of cells are\nproduced, where they are produced, and to what extent and in what direction each cell\nexpands.\nA significant developmental distinction between animals and most of the organisms cov-\nered here results from the presence of the cell wall. Animal development includes the\npossibility of cell migration, with the movement of cells allowing for particular arrange-\nments and forms to be produced. Outside of the animal kingdom, cell migration occa-\nsionally occurs but only in organisms that lack cell walls. Cells of cellular slime molds\nmust migrate in order to aggregate and subsequently move relative to each other, and cel-\nlular slime mold development involves a physical rearrangement of cells. However, when\na \u2018final\u2019 form of a cellular slime mold is produced the individual cells are no longer capa-\nble of moving because they have developed cell walls and are stuck to neighboring cells.\nAlmost all of the multicellular organisms dealt with in this book possess cell walls and\na newly produced cell is \u2018stuck\u2019 to the cell that produced it. Moreover, for all plants, cell\ndivision occurs in a region called a meristem, a region that produces new cells with a\nthree-dimensional organization. The new cells that are produced are not only attached to\ntheir parental cell, but are also attached to multiple cells that are being simultaneously\nproduced around them. In contrast, as discussed previously, fungi and some red, green\nand brown algae produce three-dimensional multicellular structures in ways that do not\ninvolve a meristem, generally by having individual filaments (one-dimensional structures)\nglued together in ways to create a three-dimensional form. CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT | 125\nDDeevveellooppmmeenntt iinn ppllaannttss\nPlants (mosses, liverworts, hornworts and vascular plants) have several developmental fea-\ntures that are not found in familiar animals:\n1. Plant growth is generally indeterminate, i.e., without a defined endpoint\n2. Plants possess meristems, embryonic regions, throughout their life.\n3. Plants exhibit modular growth, a pattern also found in some less-familiar animals\n(e.g., hydroids, corals, sponges), but not in familiar animals.\n4. Plants show alternation of generations, meaning that there are two forms of the\norganism, one haploid and one diploid. Alternation of generations (Chapter 11) is\nalso present in some green algae, brown algae, red algae and a few chytrids (fungi).\nThe first three points are considered below with the final point considered in a later sec-\ntion of the book.\nDDeetteerrmmiinnaattee aanndd iinnddeetteerrmmiinnaattee ggrroowwtthh aanndd tthhee\nggrroowwtthh ooff ppllaannttss\nBy far the most familiar pattern of organismal development is that shown by mammals\nwho grow for a short period of time (relative to the entire life of the organism) and then\nspend most of their life as an adult form. This type of development can be termed \u2018deter-\nminate\u2019 because the final form is \u2018determined\u2019, there is an endpoint (an adult) to the devel-\nopment process. While some of the organisms covered in this course, in particular many\nof the unicellular forms, show this type of development, most \u2018non-animals\u2019, and in partic-\nular plants and fungi, show a very different patterns of development, one that is described\nas indeterminate, where there is no endpoint and the organism is, in essence, everlasting.\nThe key to its everlasting nature comes from the fact that that plants retain portions of\ntheir body that are permanently embryonic. In the familiar mammalian pattern of devel-\nopment an organism is an embryo for a portion of its life and then transforms into a juve-\nnile and eventually an adult. An embryo is often defined as a \u2018young organism\u2019 but what\nmakes it special is not its age but the fact that it cells are capable of cell division, cell dif-\nferentiation and cellular growth. In animals these cellular abilities are for the most part\nonly found for a short period of time. The whole animal is basically the same age and\nthrough time it transforms from an embryo into an adult. In order to observe develop- 126 | CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT\nment in animals one observes an embryo through time. While the adult does replace cells,\nin terms of development it is not changing in form. In contrast, plants always have regions\nthat are embryonic and capable of dividing, differentiating and growing; and at any one\npoint in time one can see the developmental process by moving from the embryonic parts\nof the plant to the older parts of the plant, i.e., the entire plant is NOT all the same age.\nIf you planted an acorn ten years ago you might consider the structure that you now see\nis \u2018ten-years old\u2019, but most of it is considerably younger and one can even find parts in the\nembryonic regions that were \u2018born yesterday\u2019. At any point in time one can observe the\nentire developmental process, from embryo to \u2018adult\u2019, by moving distally, from the embry-\nonic regions, located at the tips of roots and shoots, to progressively older tissues further\nfrom the tips.\nThe embryonic regions of plants are called meristems. There are two basic features that\ndistinguish embryonic regions: (1) cells are dividing and thereby producing more cells, (2)\ncells are small, undifferentiated and not yet committed to a final cell type. The activity\nof meristems may vary seasonally, it often has periods of quiescence or dormancy, but its\nability to produce more cells that develop into a variety of cells is intrinsic to the meris-\ntem region. Very early in the life of the plant the entire plant is embryonic but soon some\nof the cells become developmentally programmed to mature into particular types of cells\nand, along with this, lose their ability to divide. In seed plants this transformation takes\nplace within the seed and a mature seed has within it a small plant with two embryonic\nregions on opposite ends of a very short root/shoot axis. Throughout the life of the plant\nthis axis will extend because of the expansion of the cells produced at the two ends. The\nmeristems produce more and more cells and the expansion of these cells pushes the two\nmeristems further away from each other and elongates the root and shoot. The se embry-\nonic regions are called primary meristems (they are the first ones formed) and also apical\nmeristems (they are located at the tips, apices, of roots and shoots). Root apical meris-\ntems divide to produce cells that extend the root axis. Shoot apical meristems serve a sim-\nilar function for shoots but while producing new shoot material they are also producing\nleaves. Growth from apical meristems is called primary growth. In general, the oldest part\nof the plant is at the soil surface and one encounters younger and younger tissues as one\nmoves towards the tips of shoots or tips of roots. The actual region of growth is generally\nrestricted to a small portion, typically a centimeter or less, just behind the meristematic\nregions. CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT | 127\nPPllaanntt ggrroowwtthh iiss mmoodduullaarr\nIn addition to being indeterminate, plant growth is modular, producing structures that\nare fundamentally self-similar and recursive. There are two basic modules to a vascular\nplant: roots and shoots, and both can produce new modules, branch roots and branch\nshoots, that are replicas of the original shoot axis and root axis. With time, a seemingly\ncomplex entity is produced, yet the rules governing its construction are very simple: the\nshoot can generate branches and these can generate more branches and these can gener-\nate even more branches. The same thing is true for roots. The growth of all the modules\nresults from the activities of apical meristems and all such growth is considered primary\ngrowth.\nFFiigg.. 1111 MMoodduullaarr ppllaanntt ggrroowwtthh:: PPllaannttss ggrrooww iinn aa mmoodduullaarr ffaasshh--\niioonn wwiitthh ttwwoo bbaassiicc mmoodduulleess:: sshhoooottss ((wwhhiicchh bbeeaarr lleeaavveess)) aanndd\nrroooottss..

The shoot apical meristem produces mounds of embryonic tissue,\ncalled leaf primordia, that divide for a period of time, grow for a period of time and then\nexist in a static form until the process of senescence is triggered that culminates with the\nleaf becoming detached from the rest of the plant.\nOOrriiggiinn ooff nneeww mmoodduulleess\nTo create a new module, one needs to create a new apical meristem. These originate dif-\nferently in roots and shoots. In roots, new apical meristems form as the result of the\nactivity of certain cells in the outermost layer of the central core of root vascular tissue\n(more details in the next chapter). Some of these cells are stimulated to start dividing\nand become organized to form a root apical meristem. Growth of cells produced by this\nmeristem pushes the branch root apical meristem out of the original root and into the\nsoil, where it continues to grow in a fashion similar to the original root.\nBranch shoots are created in a differently and originate from a shoot apical meristem. In\naddition to extending the shoot and producing embryonic leaves, the shoot apical meris-\ntem also produces a new shoot apical meristems in the \u2018axil\u2019 of each leaf. These are new\nshoot apical meristems and are called bud primordia. They are produced in a dormant\nstate and need to be stimulated to start dividing and produce new cells that will allow\nthe branch to elongate. Most bud primordia are never stimulated to grow; if they all were\nstimulated a very \u2018branchy\u2019 structure would result, with a branch being produced at every\nposition where there was or is a leaf. Often, but certainly not always, branch shoots are\nonly stimulated to grow after the leaf they are adjacent to has fallen off the plant.\nPlants are also capable of producing new modules in non-standard ways. Roots and shoots\nthus produced are termed \u2018adventitious\u2019. Sometimes roots are produced from stem tis-\nsues and these would be described as adventitious roots because all \u2018standard\u2019 roots are\nformed off existing roots. Similarly, sometimes root tissues can develop shoots; obviously\nthese are not originating in the axil of a leaf, thus these would be termed adventitious\nshoots. The ability of some plants to produce adventitious roots or shoots allows for the CHAPTER 7: PRODUCING FORM: DEVELOPMENT | 129\nvegetative propagation of plants: if detached stems can be stimulated to produce roots\nthen one can propagate plants from \u2018cuttings\u2019; similarly, roots can be used to propagate\nplants. And for some plants leaf tissue can be stimulated to produce adventitious roots\nand shoots; thus, propagation is sometimes possible from leaves. In all of these situations,\ncertain cells, called parenchyma cells, are stimulated to start dividing and organize to\nform an apical meristem. Once one module (a root or a shoot) is started, new modules can\nbe formed from it. A unique feature of parenchyma cells is their ability to \u2018de-differenti-\nate\u2019 and resume an embryonic condition, capable of dividing and producing a variety of\ncell types, even after they have differentiated to become parenchyma cells.\nCell types of vascular plants were introduced in the previous chapter but will be consid-\nered further in the next chapter, considering the anatomy of roots, stems and leaves.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\nSome interesting sites related to plant development.\n\u2022 \u201cPlant embryogenesis\u201d by Sacco C.de Vries et al.\n\u25e6 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/\nS0960982217305626\n\u2022 \u201cXylem cell death: emerging understanding of regulation and function\u201d by\nBenjamin Bollh\u00f6ner et al\n\u25e6 https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/63/3/1081/475758\n\u2022 \u201cProgrammed cell death: A way of life for plants\u201d by Jean T.

The three organs differ in\nthe distribution of vascular tissue: in roots it occurs as a single central strand; in stems,\nthe vascular tissue occurs as multiple bundles imbedded in ground tissue; and in leaves the\nvascular tissue often occurs as a reticulate network of veins or as parallel strands of vas-\ncular tissue. In both cases there is ground tissue filling the space between vascular strands\nand dermal tissue. This basic anatomy is easily seen in asparagus if one trims the base and\nlooks at the cut end. The dermal tissue is the tougher outside, the vascular bundles are\nseen as small circles scattered in the outer portion of the stem, and ground tissue makes\nup the rest.\nRoots and shoots show two polarities, a radial polarity, meaning that tissues and cells dif-\nfer as one moves outward from the center (along a radius), and a proximate/distal polar-\nity, meaning that cells at the tips of organs, where they are produced, differ from cells\naway from the tip, cells which are older. Leaves have a tip to base polarity and often have\na top/bottom polarity.\nIn this chapter, we describe in more detail the plant anatomy of flowering plants resulting\nfrom primary growth (growth derived from root or shoot apical meristems), and consider\nthe developmental changes and consequently the patterns shown with age (distance from\nthe apex).\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Root development\n\u2022 Mature root anatomy\n\u2022 Shoot development 132 | CHAPTER 8: VASCULAR PLANT ANATOMY: PRIMARY GROWTH\nFFiigg.. 11 GGeerrmmiinnaattiinngg ssuunnflfloowweerr sseeeeddss..

Near the tip is the meristem, recognized by the small size of\ncells and by mitotic activity, often evidenced by the appearance of chromosomes. Moving\nback from the tip (proximally, towards the plant body) one encounters older and more\nmature cells, recognizable because they are larger, no longer dividing, and possess features\nthat distinguish different cell types, e.g., secondary cell walls of tracheids and vessel tube CHAPTER 8: VASCULAR PLANT ANATOMY: PRIMARY GROWTH | 133\nmembers. Because there is no more cell division or expansion after one moves a short dis-\ntance from the root apex, the diameter of a root showing only primary growth is gener-\nally constant along its length, except for the terminal few millimeters. (Roots exhibiting\nsecondary growth do increase in diameter and are discussed in the next chapter). Cells\nthat are produced by the root apical meristem expand the most in a distal/proximal direc-\ntion (up/down, assuming the root is vertical) and produce cells that are elongate in this\ndirection. There is much less expansion radially, hence roots primarily grow longer, not\nwider, and this growth occurs near the root tip. Even more significant than the expansion\nof individual cells is the fact that most cell divisions in the meristematic zone divide cells,\nso that most of the additional cells that are produced are in the longitudinal (distal/prox-\nimal) plane. This is similar to how a unicellular filament divides to extend itself, with cell\ndivisions that are perpendicular to the long axis of the filament. Cell divisions in the root\napical meristem adds cells in the distal direction and only to a limited extent do roots add\ncells radially. Most roots are roughly 20 to 100 cells wide (assuming only primary growth)\nbut roots are often millions or trillions of cells long.\nAssuming a cell division that adds to the number of cells in the distal/proximal plane, a\nsecond key consideration following cell division is whether the cell that remains meris-\ntematic (and does not grow) is distal (towards the tip) or proximal (towards the rest of\nthe plant). In the vast majority of cell divisions of root meristematic cells, the cell that\nremains meristematic is distal, and the expansion of the other cell pushes the meristem-\natic region into the soil. However, in a small portion of cells it is the proximal cell that\nremains meristematic and the distal cell matures and becomes part of the protective root\ncap, located at the extreme distal end of the root. The cells of this root cap are continually\nsloughed off as the root extends through the soil, and the root cap ensures that meristem-\natic cells themselves are not sloughed off.\nDevelopmental changes in primary root growth\nProceeding proximally from the root tip one encounters the following regions which\ntransition gradually and overlap:\n\u2022 zone of cell division, the embryonic region, often less than one millimeter\n\u2022 zone of cell expansion, generally only a few millimeters in extent, a region where\ncells are elongating, and to a much lesser extent, getting bigger in diameter; .\n\u2022 zone of cell maturation, a region where cells develop characteristic features. This 134 | CHAPTER 8: VASCULAR PLANT ANATOMY: PRIMARY GROWTH\nzone extends from less than a cm to several cm in length. In the youngest part of\nthis zone root hairs are produced but they soon senesce and are lost from the plant\nSignificant aspects of cell maturation zone include (in order from the tip as one moves\nproximally):\n\u2022 conducting elements of the phloem become functional\n\u2022 the waterproof compound suberin is deposited as a casparian strip\n\u2022 conducting elements of the xylem become functional\n\u2022 root hair appearance and disappearance. Root hairs are extensions off of dermal\ncells. They are produced after these cells have stopped elongating but are present\nfor only a short time before senescing. Hence, root hairs are only present in a rela-\ntively small section of the root.\nThe significance of the casparian strip\nThese hydrophobic deposits initially occur as a band that blocks water movement\nthrough the wall from the outside to the inside. Eventually the entire endodermal cell\nwall is coated. The casparian strip forces water and any minerals dissolved in water to\nenter the cytosol at some point in their journey between the soil and the xylem tissue.\nBefore the casparian strip is deposited, i.e., in the youngest part of the root, water can\nmove from the soil to the center of the root through the \u2018apoplast\u2019, a term that describes\nthe collective space of cell walls and any water filled spaces between cells, which typically\nincludes at least 10% of the tissue volume. Because the endodermal cells are tightly bound\nto each other, once the casparian strip is deposited water is forced to move through the\nsymplast in order to cross the endodermis and get to the interior of the root. The sym-\nplast is a term that describes the collective volume of the cytosols of all cells, collective\nbecause all cells are interconnected by plasmodesmata, membrane bordered cytoplasmic\nthreads that run between cells.\nThe casparian strip of the endodermis, once deposited:\n1. allows the plant to regulate, by virtue of the selective permeability of cell mem-\nbranes, what minerals do and do not enter the xylem tissue, the conduit to the top\nof the plant\n2. allows the plant to, under certain conditions, concentrate solutes in the root xylem CHAPTER 8: VASCULAR PLANT ANATOMY: PRIMARY GROWTH | 135\nbecause the apoplast solution inside the endodermis (and connected to the xylem\ntissue) is separated by a two membranes (one providing entry into the symplast,\none providing exit from the symplast) from the apoplast solution outside the endo-\ndermis.

The root hair is thin (~ 10\num) but may extend several mm into the soil. As discussed earlier, although root hairs\ngreatly increase the area available for water and nutrient absorption, their more signifi-\ncant effect might be in increasing the volume of soil within certain distance to the root.\nConsidering root hairs, water/nutrients may:\n\u2022 enter the cytosol of the root hair and then proceed inwards through the symplast\n\u2022 enter the cell wall of the root hair and move through the apoplast to the interior of\nthe root (note that once the casparian strip is deposited in the endodermal cell\nwalls, this root is blocked) 136 | CHAPTER 8: VASCULAR PLANT ANATOMY: PRIMARY GROWTH\n\u2022 by-pass the root hair and move through the soil to the root proper\nFor moist soils water may move most quickly through the soil rather than using the\nroutes through the root hairs and it is possible that root hairs may be most significant in\nnutrient absorption rather than water absorption\nMMaattuurree rroooott aannaattoommyy\nA typical root cross section shows dermal tissue on the outside, surrounding a region\nof ground tissue (the cortex) which surrounds the endodermis, recognizable because the\nsuberized layer of the cell wall picks up stain.

But\nshoot growth is more complicated than root growth in several ways, one is the fact that\nshoot apical meristem not only extends the stem but it also produces embryonic leaves\n(leaf primordia) and branch shoots (bud primordia) positioned just above the leaves. The\npresence of these structures divides the stem into nodes, the places where leaves connect\nwith the stem, and internodes, the spaces between nodes. Both of leaf and bud primordia\ndevelop vascular tissue that needs to be connected with the vascular tissue of the main\nstem. If one were to follow the vascular tissue in a leaf or a branch back to the main stem,\none would observe one or more bundles of vascular tissue extending from the leaf/branch\nto the stem. This accounts for the presence of \u2018vascular bundles\u2019 in the stems of flowering\nplants: fundamentally they represent the traces of vascular tissue running to the leaves and\nbranches. At the nodes one can see vascular traces diverging from the stem to enter leaf\nand branch primordia. Ferns, horsetails, clubmosses and a number of fossil plant groups\nhave different patterns of vascular tissue distribution within the stem (described as \u2018stelar\nstructure\u2019) and, because vascular tissue is often represented in fossils, its distribution has\nbeen useful in classifying fossilized vascular plants.\nLeaf primordia are produced in a characteristic pattern that depends upon the species of\nplants. The most easily described pattern is one where leaves are produced in pairs on\nopposite sides of the stem. Sequentially, leaves are produced in pairs occur ring with a 90o\nrotation from the previous pair of leaves, i.e., if you were viewing a stem from the top and\nthe first pair of leaves were north and south the next set of leaves would be east and west.\nThe next set of leaves produced would be back to the original north-south orientation.\nMost plants have a more complicated phyllotaxy, i.e., arrangement of leaves, that can be\ndescribed by counting the number of new leaves and the number of rotations around the\nstem before you end up with a leaf directly under another leaf.\nWhile the elongation of roots, brought about the expansion of newly produced cells, is\ngenerally consistent in time and space, occurring soon after cells are produced and very\nclose to the root apical meristem, elongation of stems is not as consistent. Elongation of\nshoots results from extension of the internodes. In some plants, internode growth occurs\nclose to the shoot tip, resulting in a stem with leaves that separate from each near the tip\nof the shoot and at a pace consistent with the production of new leaf primordia. In other 138 | CHAPTER 8: VASCULAR PLANT ANATOMY: PRIMARY GROWTH\nplants internodal growth is delayed or absent, producing very short stems with multiple\nleaves very close together (rosettes). Such a structure may be permanent or may be tempo-\nrary until a particular cue is received and the stem \u2018bolts\u2019, rapidly elongating by increasing\nthe space between leaves, e.g., in lettuce or spinach. Some monocots (see below), in par-\nticular grasses, have meristematic zones at the nodes of stems and at the base of the blade\nof the grass leaf. These meristems are activated if the stem or leaf above them is damaged\n(usually from grazing).\nIn contrast to roots, there is no maturation of cells on the distal side of the shoot apical\nmeristem, i.e., there is no \u2018shoot cap\u2019 (cf. the root cap) derived from the shoot apical\nmeristem. Generally, the this apical meristem is not being pushed through the soil so\nthe function that the root cap provides is not generally required. However, the shoot\napical meristem is covered by young leaves that grow very close to the tip of the shoot\nand are able to cover it. Some stems, called rhizomes, do grow through the soil and they\nare protected by modified leaves called cataphylls that protect the shoot apical meris-\ntem and form a pointed structure that can more easily be pushed by growth through the\nsoil. Similar modified leaves, called bud scales, cover the shoot apical meristem of woody\nplants during the extended periods when they are not growing. While most roots often\nare actively growing most of the year including during the growing season, shoot growth\nfor plants in seasonal habitats is often of much duration. Many plants, especially trees,\nexhibit growth (extension of stems) for only a short period, often less than 30 days in the\nspring. However shoot cell division occurs much earlier than cell growth, often as much\nas eight months earlier, that is some new cells expanding in the spring were produced in\nlate summer of the previous year.\nMMaattuurree sshhoooott aannaattoommyy\nTraditionally, flowering plants were separated into two groups, monocots and dicots,\nbased on a number of features, one of which was stem anatomy. While the monocot group\nis still considered to be a valid phylogenetic entity, most workers consider \u2018dicots\u2019 to be\nan artificial grouping, and have separated dicots into \u2018eudicots\u2019 and several other groups.\nThe vast majority of the former dicot group are eudicots and in the discussion below we\nwill use the term dicots. CHAPTER 8: VASCULAR PLANT ANATOMY: PRIMARY GROWTH | 139\nDicot stems have vascular bundles arranged in a ring close to the margin of the stem. The\ntissues running from the outside to the inside are: epidermis, cortex, vascular bundles (in\na ring), with variable amounts of ground tissue in between the bundles), pith.\nMonocot stems differ from dicot stems in having vascular bundles scattered throughout\nthe stem.\nFFiigg.. 44 CClloovveerr ((TTrriiffoolliiuumm)),, aa ddiiccoott,, sstteemm,, sshhoowwiinngg vvaassccuullaarr bbuunnddlleess aarrrraannggeedd iinn aa rriinngg wwiitthh aa\nllaarrggee cceennttrraall ppiitthh..

Moreover, the diversity in leaf form found in vascular plants, especially\nfor flowering plants, far exceeds that found in roots or stems. After cellular division and\ngrowth cease, the leaf remains in an \u2018adult\u2019 form for a (generally) defined period of time\nbefore it undergoes its final developmental process of senescence that ultimately results\nin the leaf\u2019s separation from the plant (abscission).

Recall\nthat the width of a root or shoot produced by primary growth is limited because most\ncells do not expand much in the radial direction. And for most plants cell division in the\napical meristem is almost exclusively in a direction that causes more cells in the long axis,\nwith very few divisions that would increase the number of cells across the diameter of the\nroot or shoot. Primary growth allows the plant to get longer and \u2018bushier\u2019 (because of the\nadded branches) but in general it does not allow the roots and shoots to get very wide.\nThis lack of radial growth limits the height of the plant\u2014without thicker stems to resist\nthe combined efforts of wind and gravity, it is hard for a plant to become tall. At the same\ntime, competition for light gives a clear advantage to taller plants. Another problem with 146 | CHAPTER 9: SECONDARY GROWTH\nonly having primary growth is that the source of water (the youngest parts of roots) keeps\ngetting further from the place that needs water, the shoot tips where the leaves are and\nwhere new growth occurs. While branch roots, or adventitious roots may be created to\nshorten the route, the fact still remains that primary growth separates water sources from\nparts that need water. Additionally, both the conducting cells of the xylem and those of\nthe phloem can fail for a variety of reasons. Because repair of existing cells is often not\npossible and because primary growth does not allow for the production of replacement\nconducting cells, the ability to make stems wider, and in particular make them wider with\nthe addition of transport cells and structural support cells, provides some clear advan-\ntages, including but not limited to longevity.\nFFiigg.. 22 LLaatteerraall mmeerriisstteemmss aappppeeaarr aass cciirrcclleess iinn ccrroossss\nsseeccttiioonn bbuutt aaccttuuaallllyy eexxiisstt aass ccyylliinnddeerrss wwiitthhiinn sstteemmss\naanndd rroooottss..

These meristems are capable of increasing the girth of roots and shoots beyond what CHAPTER 9: SECONDARY GROWTH | 147\nis produced by primary growth. Lateral meristems are cylinders of embryonic cells run-\nning the entire length of the root/shoot axis. Cell division in these embryonic regions,\nfollowed by expansion of the new cells, allows stems and roots to increase in girth in a\ntype of growth defined as secondary growth. Because any radial expansion will rupture\nthe tissues outside of where the growth occurs, the dermal tissue produced in primary\ngrowth is going to be split open and a new \u2018skin\u2019 needs to be produced. Consequently,\nradial growth in roots and stems requires two lateral meristems, one, the vascular cam-\nbium, responsible for most of the increase in girth, and one, the cork cambium, responsi-\nble for making a new skin. In contrast to the new cells produced by the apical meristems,\nthe cell divisions of the lateral meristems are generally parallel to the surface of the root\nor shoot and the new cells expand in a radial (inside/outside) direction, thereby increas-\ning the diameter of the stem or root but not changing its length.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Vascular cambium\n\u25e6 Secondary xylem and secondary phloem\n\u25e6 Rays\n\u2022 Cork cambium\n\u2022 Evolutionary origins of secondary growth\n\u2022 Wide and woody monocots\nVVaassccuullaarr ccaammbbiiuumm\nThe vascular cambium produces new vascular tissue and is responsible for most of the\nradial expansion of stems and roots. In a cross section of a stem or root the vascular cam-\nbium exists as a circle of cells, only a few cells in width. In three dimensions the vascular\ncambium is a cylinder. Developmentally the vascular cambium originates from undiffer-\nentiated cells produced by the apical meristem, located between the xylem and phloem.\nRecall that the primary growth of stems produces xylem and phloem in bundles that,\nfor all groups other than monocots (which do not exhibit secondary growth), occur in a\nring within the stem. To make the vascular cambium a continuous ring requires that cells\nbetween the vascular bundles be stimulated to become meristematic and start dividing. 148 | CHAPTER 9: SECONDARY GROWTH\nThe vascular cambium also develops in roots, again originating from cells located between\nthe xylem and phloem plus additional cells to form a continuous ring.\nSecondary xylem and secondary phloem\nCell divisions of the vascular cambium produce xylem and phloem that is called \u2018sec-\nondary\u2019 to distinguish it from the primary xylem and phloem produced by the apical\nmeristems. Whether any particular cell produced by the action of the vascular cambium\ndifferentiates into secondary phloem or secondary xylem depends on its position, a com-\nmon factor controlling cellular differentiation. In the simplest case, when a vascular\ncambium cell divides it produces one cell that remains embryonic (does not expand or dif-\nferentiate) and one cell that is destined to expand radially and differentiate. If the matur-\ning cell is to the outside of the cell that remains meristematic it is destined to become a\nphloem cell: a sieve tube member, a parenchyma cell, or a fiber. If the maturing cell is pro-\nduced to the inside of the cell that remains meristematic it is destined to become a xylem\ncell: a vessel tube element or a tracheid or a fiber or a parenchyma cell. Most of the new\ncells produced by the vascular cambium are on the inside thus more secondary xylem is\nproduced than secondary phloem.\nThe vast majority of the cells produced by the vascular cambium are elongate along the\nlong axis of the stem (in the phloem: fibers, sieve tube elements, and sieve cells; in the\nxylem: fibers, tracheids, vessel tube members). This elongate shape is not the result of the\ngrowth of these cells; any elongation of these cells in the up/down direction is impossi-\nble: a woody stem cannot elongate in the middle, only from the tip. The elongate shape\nof these cells is the result of shape of the cell that divided to produced them. The vascular\ncambium consists primarily of cells, called fusiform initials, that are elongate and which,\nafter dividing, produce daughter cells that are also elongate. These cells only expand in a\nradial direction, i.e., they get fatter, not longer, producing a stem that is wider, not taller.\nRays\nThere are, however, a few cells of the vascular cambium, called ray initials, that are not\nelongate but are roughly cubical and they produce parenchyma cells that are not elon-\ngate in up/down direction but are slightly elongate in a radial direction. The rectangular\nparenchyma cells produced by ray initials are found in clusters (i.e., a ray initial is likely\nto have a ray initial above and/or below it in the vascular cambium), and they form struc- CHAPTER 9: SECONDARY GROWTH | 149\nFFiigg.. 33 TThhee ddeevveellooppmmeenntt ooff vvaassccuullaarr ccaammbbiiuumm iinn sstteemmss:: uuppppeerr sseerriieess:: lleefftt,, eemmbbrryyoonniicc\nrreeggiioonnss ((rreedd)) aappppeeaarr bbeettwweeeenn pprriimmaarryy xxyylleemm aanndd pprriimmaarryy pphhllooeemm;; cceenntteerr,, aa ccoommpplleettee\nmmeerriisstteemmaattiicc rriinngg iiss ffoorrmmeedd;; rriigghhtt,, cceellll ddiivviissiioonnss ooff tthhee vvaassccuullaarr ccaammbbiiuumm pprroodduuccee\nsseeccoonnddaarryy pphhllooeemm oonn tthhee oouuttssiiddee aanndd sseeccoonnddaarryy xxyylleemm oonn tthhee iinnssiiddee..

Rays are pro-\nduced in both the secondary xylem and secondary phloem and are particularly significant\nfor carbohydrate storage. Carbohydrates transported by the phloem are stored in rays and\nthen can be mobilized when needed. In secondary xylem rays are also significant as being\nthe only living cells present because the other secondary xylem cells (fibers, trachieds and\nvessel tube elements) all die very shortly after being produced. While the ray cells do not\nlive forever they do live for multiple years, and in addition to carbohydrate storage can\nrespond to pathogens.

Within the period of cambial activity, often\nthe nature of the xylem cells produced varies in a characteristic way. For instance, it is\nquite common that the cells produced late in the growth season have smaller lumens and\nproportionately thicker cell walls than cells produced in the early spring. Another com-\nmon pattern results from vessel tube elements only being produced in the early spring, so\nthat each spring\u2019s growth is easily identified by the presence of large vessel tube elements.\nBecause of such changes, there is generally a substantial contrast between the last cells\nformed at the end of the growing season and the first cells formed the following spring.\nThis results in a pattern known as \u2018annual rings\u2019 when wood is viewed in cross section. In\na radial longitudinal section the growth \u2018rings\u2019 are present as parallel lines. 152 | CHAPTER 9: SECONDARY GROWTH\nFFiigg.. 66 WWoooodd,, sseeeenn iinn aa ccrroossss--sseeccttiioonn ((ttoopp ooff bblloocckk)) aanndd aa lloonnggiittuuddiinnaall rraaddiiaall\nsseeccttiioonn ((ssiiddee wwiitthh ttaappee))..

Newly produced secondary phloem cells, as long as\nthey are alive, can resist being crushed, as can highly lignified fiber cells which often are\npresent, but most other cells are crushed by the outward expansion caused by growth of\nthe cells produced by the vascular cambium.

Like the vascular\ncambium, the cork cambium produces different cells to the inside and outside; the cells\nproduced to the outside are short-lived and have cells walls that are impregnated with\nsuberin, a waxy waterproof compound. The cells that are produced to the inside are\nparenchyma cells and live for a longer time, usually several years. This is significant\nbecause the cells of the cork cambium, unlike those of the vascular cambium and apical\nmeristems, are not long-lived; they die within a few years. And a new cork cambium\nforms to the interior, originating in the parenchyma cells that were formed to the inside\nof the older cork cambium. In shoots, the initial cork cambium originates within the cor-\ntex and subsequent cork cambia originate from derivatives of earlier ones. In roots, the\ncork cambium originates from activity of the pericycle and again reforms inward from\nparenchyma cells produced by earlier cork cambia. Thus, through time the cork cambium 154 | CHAPTER 9: SECONDARY GROWTH\nFFiigg.. 88 TTuulliipp ppooppllaarr ((LLiirriiooddeennddrroonn)) aafftteerr 44 yyeeaarrss ooff ggrroowwtthh..

The cells that the cork cambium produces, as well as the secondary phloem\ncells, are continually being compressed by expansion from within; these tissues are also\nbeing split apart as the trunk\u2019s girth increases.\nIn general, the cells produced to the outside by the cork cambium are closely packed and\nhave no cracks or air spaces, as was the case for the original epidermis. But the cork cam-\nbium regularly produces areas called lenticels where there are cracks and fissures. It is\nthought that lenticels are significant in allowing oxygen penetration into the stem. At\nthe same time, lenticels provide a space to allow water to escape and pathogens to enter.\nThis again highlights the fact that while some aspects of life are favored by isolation from\nthe outside environment, other aspects of life require connection with the outside envi-\nronment.\nIn woody stems the material to the inside of the vascular cambium (all of it secondary\nxylem, ignoring the tiny bit of primary xylem and pith that may remain in the center of\nthe stem) is called wood.

In most primary growth there are rela-\ntively few woody cells, but in some monocots (e.g., bamboo, which is a grass) primary\ntissues can be quite woody. Also, because monocots lack secondary growth and because\nprimary growth is generally limited in a radial direction, monocots are generally narrow.\nHowever, some monocots (e.g., palms, joshua tree) show prolonged radial expansion in\nprimary growth and consequently can produce stems of substantial girth.\nFFiigg.. 1133 JJoosshhuuaa ttrreeee\u2014\u2014aa wwooooddyy mmoonnooccoott tthhaatt\nggrroowwss iinn ppaarrttss ooff SSoouutthheerrnn CCaalliiffoorrnniiaa ((vviissiitt\nJJoosshhuuaa TTrreeee NNaattiioonnaall MMoonnuummeenntt!!)),, AArriizzoonnaa,,\nNNeevvaaddaa aanndd UUttaahh..\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 The Structure of Tree Bark by NatureTech.

This is nicely demon-\nstrated with a visit to a greenhouse but can also be seen by looking at outdoor plants, both\nin native habitats and in gardens. At the same time, all seed plants are fundamentally the\nsame in form and follow a pattern depicted in the Fig. 1 and described as being \u2018modu-\nlar\u2019 and \u2018recursive\u2019. What accounts for the apparent diversity in plant form when they are\nbasically put together the same way? There are six key areas of variation that influence\nthe above-ground form of flowering plants and these are listed below and are main sec-\ntions of this chapter. While the bulk of the chapter deals with flowering plants the form\nof non-flowering seed plants and vascular plants without seeds is also discussed.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Flowering plants\n\u25e6 Factors affecting above ground form\n\u25aa Internode length\n\u25aa Branching frequency\n\u25aa Variation in the size, shape and orientation of leaves\n\u25aa Direction of growth of stems and branches\n\u25aa Presence or lack of secondary growth\n\u25aa Loss of parts (leaves and branches)\n\u25e6 Below-ground form\n\u2022 Form of non-flowering seed plants\n\u2022 Form of vascular plants without seeds CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM | 163\nFFiigg.. 11 TThhee mmoodduullaarr aanndd rreeccuurrssiivvee nnaattuurree ooff\nppllaanntt ffoorrmm 164 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\nFFaaccttoorrss aaffffeeccttiinngg flfloowweerriinngg ppllaanntt ffoorrmm II:: IInntteerrnnooddee\nlleennggtthh\nFig. 2a Dandelion rosette. All the leaves Fig. 2b Amaryllis has a similar growth\nare connected to a very short stem. pattern although its leaves are more erect\nDo dandelions have stems (Fig. 2a)? They must, because they have leaves and leaves are\nalways attached to stems, but dandelion stems certainly are not very evident because they\nare so very short. You could say that dandelions are \u2018vertically challenged\u2019 and as a result,\ntheir leaves are very closely clustered, forming what is known as a rosette. Rosettes are a\ncommon plant life form and result from the fact that the distance between individual\nleaves is extremely short, making it appear that there is no stem. While the leaves of dan-\ndelion typically run horizontally, parallel to the ground, some plants, like Amaryllis (Fig.\n2b) also have very short stems but with leaves that are oriented more vertically. Dande-\nlions live for a number of years and never produce a recognizable stem, although they do\nproduce branches that are flowering stalks. Other plants, including both agricultural\ncrops (e.g., carrots, beets, cabbage, turnip) and common weeds (e.g., mullen, burdock,\n\u2018wild\u2019 carrot, garlic mustard) are biennials. They form a rosette in their first growth sea-\nson (Fig. 3) and in their second year of growth they \u2018bolt\u2019 as the stem produces much\nlonger internodes to produces a more \u2018normal-looking\u2019, elongate stem, upon which are\nborn flowers (Fig. 4). A small number of plants, including the one used to make tequila,\nare a rosette for multiple years, maybe 7-10, before the stem \u2018bolts.\u2019 CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM | 165\nFFiigg.. 33 MMuulllleenn,, aa ccoommmmoonn wweeeedd,, sshhoowwiinngg iittss rroosseettttee ffoorrmm\naafftteerr oonnee yyeeaarr ooff ggrroowwtthh\nWhat determines internode length?\nRecall that leaves and stem material are produced in the embryonic region called the api-\ncal meristem at the very tip of stems. In this region new cells are produced by mitosis\nand the cells are organized as new stem material and as leaf primordia, outgrowths from\nthe stem that grow and produce the structures that we know of as leaves. In dandelions\nand other rosette plants, the distance between leaves is very short. As mentioned above,\ninternode length may vary with age, or more specifically vary with environmental factors\nthat coordinate with age, in which case plant form may drastically change with age (see\nimages of mullen, above). Internodes produced in the first season of growth are very short,\nthose in the second season of growth, after the plant has been exposed to a cold period,\nare a great deal longer. 166 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\nFFiigg.. 44 MMuulllleenn,, sshhoowwiinngg iittss ffoorrmm aafftteerr aa sseeccoonndd yyeeaarr ooff\nggrroowwtthh\u2014\u2014tthhee sstteemm hhaass bboolltteedd aann tthhee iinntteerrnnooddee lleennggtthh\n((tthhee ddiissttaannccee bbeettwweeeenn lleeaavveess)) iiff mmuucchh ggrreeaatteerr tthhaann iinn\ntthhee fifirrsstt yyeeaarr ooff ggrroowwtthh CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM | 167\nWhat are the consequences of producing\nrosettes as opposed to stems with leaves\nmore widely spaced (Fig. 4, 6)?

A second factor is self-shading of\nleaves, although this is influenced by sev-\neral other factors including the size of the\nleaves and their distribution on the stem.\nFFiigg.. 55 MMaannyy rroooott ccrrooppss,, iinncclluuddiinngg ttuurrnniipp,, aarree\nbbiieennnniiaallss hhaarrvveesstteedd aatt tthhee eenndd ooff tthhee ssuummmmeerr Also, plants with short stems and clus-\naafftteerr ppllaannttiinngg..

At the same\ntime, growing upward exposes the plant to a number of problems that are not present if\nit stays low to the ground. One is mechanical. Growing upward requires stems to be able\nto resist the combined effects of gravity and wind. Another problem is that an elevated\nshoot apical meristem becomes more apparent and vulnerable, at least to some herbivores.\nThe loss of the terminal apical meristem is particularly damaging because it eliminates\nthe source of growth, although growth may continue by the activation/stimulation of lat-\neral buds. The accessibility of the stem tip depends on the herbivore\u2014something big, and\nespecially something big with a big nose (think deer!) might have a hard time nipping the\ntip of a dandelion, but have no difficulty nipping the tip of a tomato plant. But for\nsmaller herbivores like insects, stem tips are available for both short and tall plants.\nFFaaccttoorrss aaffffeeccttiinngg flfloowweerriinngg ppllaanntt ffoorrmm IIII:: BBrraanncchhiinngg\nffrreeqquueennccyy\nNote the images of Diffenbachia and cabbage (Fig 6). Like dandelion, they have no\nbranches. \u2018Typical\u2019 plants with modular growth and a dendritic form have branches and\nthe branches have branches. This repetitive pattern is one of the familiar aspects of plant\nform that makes them so appealing as an artistic model. However, some plants, like dan-\ndelion, Diffenbachia and cabbage, have no branches, there is just one axis to the plant,\nand this gives them, and other plants, a distinct look. 168 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\nFFiigg.. 66 IImmppaacctt ooff iinntteerrnnooddee ddiissttaannccee..

A branch primordium is a replica of the shoot apex, an embryonic\nshoot capable of elongating and producing a shoot with leaves upon it. All that needs to\nhappen to produce a branch is that the branch primordium be stimulated to start grow-\ning. Branch upon branch upon branch can be produced as each shoot in turn produces\nleaves that have branch shoots appear from their base. This does not happen in dande-\nlion and in many other plants, both rosette and non-rosette. In such plants, growth occurs\nsolely from the original shoot, although many of them will form branches if the original\nshoot apical meristem is removed. In dandelion, although branch primordia are produced,\nthey are only activated to grow after being transformed into flower primodia (technically\ninflorescence primordia). Thus, when activated, they produce not a branch but a leaf-\nless dandelion \u2018flower\u2019 (technically it is an inflorescence, a cluster of flowers, not a single\nflower). This type of growth pattern is also seen in Aloe and a number of other rosette\nplants.\nFrequently one may see a cluster of dandelion plants together, which might appear like\na group of branches. However, these are usually formed when the root of a dandelion is\nbroken off (usually as the result of someone trying to pull it up). The root that remains is\nstimulated to form new (adventitious) shoots. Often what happens is that multiple shoots\nare produced by a single root, forming in a cluster of stems. Each of them originated sep-\narately from the root tissue, so what you see is not a cluster of branches but instead a\ncluster of adventitious shoots.\nOften branches don\u2019t look like branches\nIn grasses and many other plants, the branches often aren\u2019t recognized as such. Branches\noften appear at the base of the plant when branch (bud) primordia of the lowest leaves\nare stimulated to grow in one of three ways (Fig. 7 and 8): (1) extending vertically, produc-\ning a leafy stem called a tiller in grasses (on non-grasses this sometimes called a \u2018sucker\u2019\nor a \u2018pup\u2019) that is basically the same in structure and function as the original stem; (2)\nextending horizontally and above-ground, producing only rudimentary leaves with very\nreduced blades and elongate sheaths. These horizontal stems (branches) are called stolons;\n(3) extending horizontally but below ground, again producing only rudimentary leaves.\nThese horizontal underground stems (branches) are called rhizomes. Stolons and rhi-\nzomes are sometimes considered a means of reproduction; they can also be thought of\nas providing mobility. Eventually both produce vertical, photosynthetic stems that origi-\nnate from the bud primordia associated with the rudimentary leaves. A number of plants 170 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\n(e.g., goldenrods, asters) that appear to exist as vertical stems are actually a group of ver-\ntical branches all connected to a below-ground stem (rhizome).\nFig. 7 Rhizomes (horizontal below-ground\nstems) of goldenrod.\nFFaaccttoorrss aaffffeeccttiinngg flfloowweerriinngg ppllaanntt ffoorrmm IIIIII:: VVaarriiaattiioonn iinn\ntthhee ssiizzee,, sshhaappee aanndd oorriieennttaattiioonn ooff lleeaavveess\nIn contrast to dandelions, which look like they don\u2019t have a stem when they actually do,\ngrasses (and a number of other plants, including bananas) possess something that looks\nlike a stem but actually isn\u2019t. The \u2018trunk\u2019 of a banana plant is actually a cluster of leaf\nbases tightly wound (Fig. 9) around each other and called a \u2018pseudostem\u2019 because it has\nthe appearance of a stem. Bananas and grasses are monocots, a group that includes orchids\nand a number of other flowering plants. One feature commonly found in monocots, and\nspecifically in banana and grasses, is a leaf with two main parts (Fig. 10). One part is\ncalled the blade; this is typically flattened and extends outward from the plant and is\noften roughly horizontal to the ground. This is the part that most people recognize as a\nleaf. If you follow the blade back to the rest of the plant, it abruptly narrows (a great\ndeal in banana, less so in grasses) to a section of the leaf that is vertically oriented and\ncylindric. This part of the leaf is called the sheath. Early in the growth of both grasses and\nbananas the structure that looks like a stem is actually just multiple leaf sheaths extending\nupward from a very short stem, like a dandelion stem.\nWhile dandelion leaves are generally horizontally displayed, in grasses the bases of the\nleaves (i.e., the sheaths) are vertical. The more recently produced leaf sheaths are located\ninside of older ones and they collectively form a structure that seems like a stem.

If one were to measure the internode lengths of the first\n10 leaves of a grass they might be (in mm and starting with the first leaf produced): 1, 1,\n1, 1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200. After producing six leaves the stem is 6 mm in height, after\nproducing four more leaves it is 506 mm in height. The stem \u2018telescopes\u2019 upward inside\nof the sheaths, and often exposes the uppermost nodes, the actual point attachment of\nleaves to the stem. When the stem of a grass or a banana elongates, it signals the end of\nthe life of that stem and its associated leaves. An inflorescence is produced at the end of\nthe stem, with flowers that develop into fruits. Nutrients are mobilized from the leaves to 172 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\nFFiigg.. 99 BBaannaannaa ppllaanntt..

As noted above, many grasses and bananas branch from\nthe base and this may perpetuate the organism even if the original stem flowers, senesces\nand dies.\nDandelion, grass and banana leaves just scratch the surface of variation in leaf form. Palm\nleaves may be up to 25 m in length and duckweed leaves are about 3 mm (Fig. 11, 12). Most\nleaves are flat but some are thick (succulent) and may be round and bead like (Fig. 13).\nSome leaves are appressed to the stem (Fig. 14). Leaves can be lobed and toothed in a\nvariety of ways. Many leaves are dissected into parts sometimes in such ways that it isn\u2019t\nobvious whether one is looking at a leaf or a leaflet (Fig. 15).

As mentioned earlier, branches may be hidden below ground because\nthey do not grow vertically but instead extend horizontally below the ground. As a result,\nmultiple stems rising from the ground may not be separate plants but actually be branches\nthat extend vertically from a main stem that is running horizontally below ground. While\nmost familiar plants have stems that grow upwards, the exact angles vary and some run\nhorizontally, producing what is known a \u2018prostrate\u2019 growth form seen in partridge berry\nand strawberry below (Fig. 16-17)\nSome plants (pin oak) have branches that extend roughly 90 degrees from a vertically ori-\nented stem, i.e., they extend horizontally. Other plants have branches that run more ver-\ntically, perhaps at an angle of 45 degrees from the main stem.

In the\nexample of grasses or banana described above the original stem is vertical but 1st order\nbranches may run horizontally (if they are rhizomes or stolons) and third order branches\n(i.e., branches off of the stolon/rhizome) again run vertically. Thus plants vary in the way\nthat the original stem and its branches are oriented, both within a plant and between dif-\nferent species. 176 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\nFFiigg.. 1133 AAnn eexxaammppllee ooff lleeaaff vvaarriiaattiioonn:: ssttrriinngg ooff ppeeaarrll lleeaavveess aarree\naallmmoosstt sspphheerriiccaall..\nFFaaccttoorrss aaffffeeccttiinngg flfloowweerriinngg ppllaanntt ffoorrmm VV:: wwhheetthheerr oorr\nnnoott tthhee sstteemmss aanndd bbrraanncchheess eexxhhiibbiitt sseeccoonnddaarryy\n((ggeenneerraallllyy wwooooddyy)) ggrroowwtthh\nSecondary growth allows plants to become wider and taller. While most people associate\nwoodiness with trees, two other plant forms are woody: \u2018Shrubs\u2019 have no rigid definition\nbut are tree-like but show limited growth in height but abundant branching (Fig. 18).\nMost vines (lianas) are woody and have an interesting cellular nature that lacks scle- CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM | 177\nFFiigg.. 1144 TThhee lleeaavveess ooff ttaammaarriixx aarree ssmmaallll aanndd ssccaallee--lliikkee,, ffoorrmmiinngg wwhhaatt llooookkss ttoo bbee aa\npphhoottoossyynntthheettiicc sstteemm..

Most plants\ndiscard pieces as they grow. Generally, the discarded parts are leaves but branches may\nalso be shed (Fig. 19-20). The loss of parts may be synchronous, as it is with most decid-\nuous trees, but other plants may shed parts continuously. Plant structure is dynamic and 178 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\nFFiigg.. 1155 AA ssiinnggllee lleeaaff ooff aa bbooxx eellddeerr\nttrreeee wwiitthh fifivvee lleeaaflfleettss..

These changes\nare often not noticed, except by gardeners/landscapers, because the changes are relatively\nslow, the new growth looks just like the old growth and the pieces shed are matched by\npieces added. For most plants both the growth and the shedding are usually sporadic,\noccurring in spurts with inactivity between them.\nBelow-ground form\nRoot systems also have a variety of forms but, obviously, it is harder to see the form of\nroot systems. One distinction that is often cited is the distinction between a taproot sys-\ntem, where the embryonic root (the one formed in the seed) persists and becomes the\nmain trunk of the root system that connects with the stem. Note that a carrot is perhaps\nnot the best example of this, even though it is often used, because in carrot the root is per-\nforming a carbohydrate storage function, something that does not have to be the case for\nplants with taproots. In contrast to taproots, many plants have a root system that forms\nfrom adventitious roots that are produced off of stem/rhizome/stolon and do not have CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM | 179\nFFiigg.. 1166 PPaarrttrriiddggee bbeerrrryy\na dominant, primary root. Fibrous root systems may only have a few levels of branch-\ning whereas taproots typically have more, especially as they age. The primary function of\nroots is to acquire water and the pattern of water distribution is significant to root system\nform, specifically lateral spread vs. vertical spread. Alfalfa roots are known to penetrate\n15 meters down in order to obtain water. On the other hand, most cactus roots spread\nextensively but do not penetrate deep in the soil. Cactus also commonly produce roots\nquickly after a rain and then rapidly loose them (i.e., they senesce and die) as the soil dries.\nAll plants, not just cactus, shed root structure; similar to the situation aboveground, root\nstructure is dynamic, with pieces continually being added and shed.\nFFoorrmm ooff sseeeedd ppllaannttss wwiitthhoouutt flfloowweerrss\nThere are four groups of seed plants that lack flowers. Representatives of most of these\ngroups are present in the \u2018Organisms to Know\u2019 section and are highly in blue. 180 | CHAPTER 10: VASCULAR PLANT FORM\nFFiigg.. 1177 SSttrraawwbbeerrrryy ppllaannttss\nThe ginkgophyte group only has a single species, ginkgo, which in form is typical of\na deciduous (angiosperm) tree (Fig. 21), except that the leaves are unusual, being fan\nshaped with bifurcating parallel veins. Ginkgo also has \u2018spur shoots\u2019 (\u2018short shoots\u2019),\nbranches with a very short internode distance and consequently leaves clustered very close\ntogether. Spur shoots make identification of ginkgo easy during the winter months.

Most\nconifers have tree-like forms (Fig. 22) with\na fairly rigid branching pattern that pro-\nduces the characteristic \u2018Christmas tree\u2019\nshape.

It produces only two\nleaves which grow from the base and elongate to form long, strap-like leaves that often\nshred longitudinally so it appears that there are more than two leaves. The apical meris-\ntem dies after these two leaves are produced and hence there is no stem.

While some other \u2018living things\u2019 (e.g., cells, some\norganelles) can reproduce, many forms of life cannot (e.g., tissues, organs (usually) , many\ncommunities). We have defined organisms as biological entities that are discrete in time,\ni.e., they have a beginning and ending; organisms originate as the result of a reproduction\nevent carried out by some already existing organism(s). Although sex is often associated\nwith reproduction, it is a distinct phenomenon. And many organisms, especially non-ani-\nmal organisms, usually reproduce in ways that do not involve sex and some have no sexual\nprocess at all.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Reproduction \u2014 single celled organisms\n\u2022 Reproduction \u2014multi-cellular organisms\n\u2022 Reproduction and dispersal in space\n\u2022 Sex\n\u2022 Examples from the green, red and brown algae\n\u25e6 Chlamydomonas\n\u25e6 Oedogonium\n\u25e6 Fucus\n\u25e6 Saprolegnia\n\u25e6 Lamanaria\n\u25e6 Ulva\n\u25e6 Porphyra\n\u25e6 Polysiphonia CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX | 197\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\u2014\u2014ssiinnggllee cceelllleedd oorrggaanniissmmss\nFor single celled organisms, reproduction is a familiar and conceptually simple process\n(although the cellular details are far from simple!)\u2014cell division.

Consequently, before the cell divides it needs to replicate\nits DNA and give each daughter cell a copy. For eukaryotic organisms, the DNA is pack-\naged in units, chromosomes, that replicate before division, with one copy going to each\ndaughter cell, i.e. the process of mitosis. Also present in eukaryotic cells are organelles 198 | CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX\n(e.g. mitochondria) that need to replicate before cell division, with at least one ending\nup in each daughter cell. For photosynthetic organisms the same would be true for plas-\ntids that develop into chloroplasts. Remember that most biologists consider mitochon-\ndria and plastids to be remnants of unicellular organisms and their ability to divide is\nsupport for this idea.\nReproduction has to involve growth at some point but, as discussed in Chapter 7, growth\nmight come after cell division (a cell is cut in half and then each half grows to full size) or\nbefore (a cell grows to twice its normal size and divides); ultimately reproduction requires\nthat the organism acquire material, but this does not need to be a direct part of reproduc-\ntion.\nAlthough basically simple in outline, cell division, and the reproduction that it brings\nabout in unicellular organisms, involves a myriad of details, some of which are unique to\nparticular groups and are used to unite (classify) organisms.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\u2014\u2014mmuullttii--cceelllluullaarr oorrggaanniissmmss\nReproduction in multicellular organisms\ninvolves another level of complexity\nbecause it requires the coordinated pro-\nduction of multiple cell types positioned\nin time and space in ways that achieve a\nfunctional organism (i.e., a developmental\nprocess, see Chapter 7). The information\nto direct this development is present in\nthe DNA, and since most, or all, of the\ncells of an organism possess the same\nDNA, any of these potentially could\ndevelop into a new, multicellular organ-\nism.

The develop-\nmental potential that can transform a single cell into a multicellular organism generally CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX | 199\nonly finds expression under very limited circumstances. For most familiar organisms\n(mammals) this potential is only revealed in a single cell, the zygote (defined and dis-\ncussed below). In these organisms, in spite of the fact that all cells have the same genetic\ninformation, only the zygote uses it to develop into a new organism as it undergoes\nembryogenesis and transforms into an embryo. However, in many of the organisms stud-\nied in this course, this developmental potential is encountered more frequently, and cells\nthat aren\u2019t zygotes can develop into new multicellular organisms in a process described\nas somatic embryogenesis. This may occur spontaneously or may be induced to occur.\nBryophyllum, or mother plant (Fig. 2), nicely illustrates this. On the margins of its leaves\nnew plants develop. This is possible because certain leaf cells behave like a zygote, using\ntheir potential to develop into a new organism (at least they will be new organisms when\nthey detach from the parent plant). Another plant exhibiting the same ability is bulb-\nbearing fern (Fig. 3) which also produces structures on its leaves that detach and grow into\nnew plants.\nNew multicellular organisms do not nec-\nessarily have to originate from the prolif-\neration of a single cell. Reproduction can\nbe achieved by the cleaving of an existing\norganism into two or more parts, as long\nas the resultant pieces of an organism are\ncapable of regenerating the missing parts,\nor if the organism is so simple that it\ndoesn\u2019t have parts, e.g., a filamentous\nFFiigg.. 33 CCyyssttoopptteerriiss bbuullbbiiffeerraa,, bbuullbb bbeeaarriinngg\nalgae or a fungus.

Since a\nrreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nnew organism can be produced by break-\ning a piece off an existing organism, a\nmeans of enhancing reproduction would be to have pieces that easily break off. This hap-\npens in Bryophyllum and in bulb-bearing ferns and in many other organisms as well. Both\nmosses and liverworts commonly produce \u2018splash cups\u2019, cup shaped organs (Fig. 4) that\nhave at their bottom clusters of cells packaged into disk-shaped gemmae (singular gemma)\nthat are easily dislodged and can be thrown out of the cup by a water droplet whose force\nis focused by the shape of the cup. 200 | CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn aanndd ddiissppeerrssaall iinn ssppaaccee\nThe phenomenon of splash cups points\nout that reproduction isn\u2019t just about\nmaking new organisms, it is also about\nmoving organisms around, i.e., dispersal.\nFor many of the organisms dispersal may\nbe the most significant aspect of repro-\nduction, far more important than the\nmaking of a new individual. For familiar\n(determinate) organisms like mammals,\nreproduction is the only way to be perpet-\nuated through time. In contrast, organ-\nisms that are indeterminate can\npotentially live forever, so continuation\nthrough time may not be a significant\nconsequence of reproduction, but disper-\nFFiigg.. 44 SSppllaasshh ccuuppss iinn MMaarrcchhaannttiiaa,, aa ccoommpplleexx\nsal often is.

Particularly for the organisms covered in this book, most of\nwhom are immobile, it is often the case that reproduction is less about making new indi-\nviduals and more about getting to new areas. \u2018Pando\u2019, the clone of aspen growing in Utah\n(see Populus), apparently has perpetuated itself for 80,000 years just by growing.\nAlthough in the past 80,000 years it has spread to new areas, it is not moving around very\nquickly. And, significantly, it is growing in an area where seedling establishment is impos-\nsible (i.e., conditions are less hospitable now than they used to be).\nGetting to new areas involves the production of propagules, a unit that not only makes\nnew organisms (reproduction), it also can put them in a new place. A fungus that pro-\nduces a million spores may seem impressive but the consequences in its immediate area\nmay be trivial. Similarly, a pine tree that produces thousands of seeds may be doing noth-\ning to its functional population size at that site and at that time; the more significant\neffect of producing propagules is enhancing the possibility of establishing a population at\nsome distant site or this site at some time in the future. Common propagules are spores CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX | 201\nand seeds but certainly the \u2018bulbs\u2019 of bulb-bearing ferns and the gemmae of mosses and\nliverworts should be considered propagules as well.\nProbably the most significant feature that most propagules possess that enhances their\ndispersal ability is the fact that they are generally inactive, \u2018dormant\u2019. A general feature of\ncells and organisms is that the less active they are the less sensitive they are to a variety\nof \u2018insults\u2019, in particular desiccation and adverse temperatures. Cells and tissues that are\nin an inactive state, e.g., most spores, seeds, tree buds in the winter, can withstand con-\nditions that active tissues cannot. The changes that accompany inactivity include changes\nin membrane and protein structure. An indicator of inactivity is a low metabolic (respi-\nratory) rate associated with a general lack of any cellular activity such as protein synthesis\nor cytoplasmic streaming. Because of their inactivity, many spores can survive prolonged\nperiods without the basic requirements that most organism require: moisture, matter and\nenergy availability, temperatures within a particular range. This aids in dispersal simply\nbecause the propagule can travel longer distances while still being viable. Becoming dor-\nmant is a physiological process that may be triggered by specific environmental condi-\ntions or may simply be an aspect of a developmental pattern, e.g., a cell is programmed\nto become inactive soon after being created. What triggers the resumption of activity in a\npropagule varies from the return to \u2018favorable conditions\u2019, e.g., warmth and moisture, to\nmore specific environmental cues, e.g., photoperiod. Some of these are discussed in Chap-\nter 16.\nThe two common propagules found in the organisms covered here are spores and seeds.\nSeeds are only found in some plants and will be discussed in depth later. For now, simply\nappreciate that seeds function both in dispersal and reproduction. Spores are found in\nalmost all of the organisms covered here (Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, most protists, all\nplants (including those that have seeds). Their function varies considerably, from being a\nstructure primarily associated with perpetuation in time (endospores of bacteria, akinites\nof cyanobacteria, zygospores of bread molds) to functioning primarily for reproduction\nand dispersal (zoospores of water molds and Oedegonium) or primarily for sex (considered\nlater in this chapter and in Chapter 14).\nMany organisms produce multiple types of spores which may differ in their structure\nand function, e.g., degree of dormancy, specific requirements required for resumption\nof growth (see bread molds, Oedogonium). A common type of spore is called a zoospore,\na flagellated spore found in many of the green algae, most of the water molds, many\nbrown algae, and many of the chytrids (the only fungi that possess flagellated cells). 202 | CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX\nZoospores reflect the costs and benefits tied to mobility: their flagella provide them with\nthe mobility that unflagellated cells lack, but flagella require metabolic activity and conse-\nquently zoospores have limited lifespans and this limits their mobility and dispersal abil-\nity. Another trade-off relates to size. Spores are single cells and generally very small. This\nenhances mobility by allowing for dispersal by wind. However, any spore benefits by stor-\ning material that will be utilized in establishing the new growth following spore germina-\ntion. The more material saved the heavier the spore is and the more limited its dispersal.\nThese same considerations are significant to seeds, which are multicellular propagules\nconsidered in a Chapter 14.\nAlthough reproduction is obviously of significance to the organism(s) that are produced,\none final general point about reproduction concerns its impact on the \u2018parent\u2019 organism.\nBecause reproduction utilizes material and energy that might otherwise be used to per-\npetuate the life of the parent organism, reproduction generally diminishes the likelihood\nthat the parent will be perpetuated through time. The magnitude of this detrimental\neffect varies from highly significant, when reproduction insures the death of the parent\n(salmon, wheat plants) to extremely trivial, when reproduction has virtually no effect on\nthe survival of the parent. Because of this impact on the reproducing organisms, reproduc-\ntive effort is evolutionarily modified and often controlled by specific environmental cues\n(Chapter 16). Besides the impact at the individual level, reproduction also has potential\nconsequences at the population/species level, increasing the population size and perpet-\nuating the species through time. This effect is strongly dependent upon on other condi-\ntions.\nSSeexx\nMost students equate sex and reproduction, but they really are two separate processes that\nhappen to be combined in the organisms that we are most familiar with. Reproduction is\nabout making new organisms; sex is about mixing the genetic information of two organ-\nisms. Bacteria and Archaea exchange genetic information by several different processes\n(conjugation, transformation, transduction) but none of these are considered to be sex.\nSex is defined as a particular type of genetic exchange that can only happen in organisms\nwith chromosomes (eukaryotic organisms). Sex requires the fusion of two cells (syngamy),\nproducing a cell with twice the number of chromosomes as either of the parent cells. Gen-\nerally, both of the fusing cells have one copy of each chromosome and are described as\nbeing haploid, while the fused cell has two copies of each chromosome and is described as CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX | 203\nbeing diploid. Sex also requires a mechanism that can produce haploid cells from diploid\ncells. This process is meiosis, unfortunately often described as a \u2018type of cell division,\u2019 but\nis more aptly described as a process involving two cell divisions that produces haploid\ncells from diploid cells. Keep in mind that the haploid cells that are produced don\u2019t sim-\nply separate the chromosomes of a diploid cell into two groups, the two groups each have\none copy of each \u2018type of chromosome\u2019. Consider Arabidopsis (\u2018Mouse-ear cress\u2019), the most\nstudied plant in the world. If one looks at the chromosomes of a diploid cell, one sees ten\nchromosomes. But closer examination of the chromosomes reveals that there are actually\nfive distinct types of chromosomes present, and their are two chromosomes of each type.\n(A chromosome can be recognized by its size and shape. And genetic analysis reveals that\nthey are also distinct in the genes that they possess.) In Arabidopsis, meiosis produces cells\nwith five chromosomes not ten, moreover, it produces cells that have one of each type of\nchromosome, i.e., a complete set.\nSex is a process that allows genetic material (genes) from two different organisms to be\nmixed. It almost always involves producing new individuals (reproduction). However, the\nunicellular organism Paramecium demonstrates that sex can happen with no reproduction:\ntwo cells, each with a diploid nucleus join temporarily. The diploid nucleus of each cell\nundergoes meiosis to form four haploid nuclei, three of these disintegrate and the remain-\ning one divides mitotically to produce two haploid nuclei in each of the joined cells. Each\ncell sends one of these two nuclei to the other cell so that both cells have two nuclei, its\n\u2018original\u2019 one and one that came from its partner. Finally, in each cell, the two nuclei fuse\nto form a diploid nucleus, the original condition. Thus, the cells have undergone the sex-\nual cycle but have not reproduced: there were two cells at the beginning and there are two\ncells at the end. Although sex and reproduction are different processes, they often (espe-\ncially in familiar organisms) occur simultaneously.\nSpecifically, sex requires:\n\u2022 Fusion of two cells and the subsequent fusion of the two nuclei in a process called\nsyngamy, combining the genetic information of each. A ssuming that the original\ncells had one copy of each gene (i.e., the cells were haploid), the product of fusion\nwill have two copies of each gene, i.e., will be diploid. Only special cells have the\nability to fuse with one another and these cells are called gametes.\n\u2022 A process (meiosis) that starts with a diploid cell and produces haploid cells, each\nwith one copy of each chromosome. This process is feasible in eukaryotes because 204 | CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX\nthey have genes that are packaged into structures (chromosomes) that can be sorted\nand moved. Describing a cell as \u2018having two copies of each gene\u2019 is the same as say-\ning that the cell has \u2018two copies of each chromosome\u2019(in fact it is more accurate\nsince it is commonly the case that genes often get replicated, i.e. a haploid cell com-\nmonly has multiple copies of a gene, sometimes all copies are on one chromosom e,\nother times it has copies of a gene on several chromosomes.)\nMost students consider sex to be related to the fusion process, but it is important to\nappreciate that meiosis is also an essential part. The essential components of sex (syngamy\nand meiosis) are sometimes distantly separated in time and may be separated between\norganisms. We will study a number of situations where two types of organisms are pro-\nduced, both associated with the same species; one organism develops from a diploid cell\n(zygote) produced by syngamy and is diploid; the other develops from a haploid cell\n(spore) and is haploid. However, there are other organisms where the cell created by syn-\ngamy immediately undergoes meiosis, i.e., both steps of sex, syngamy and meiosis, occur\nin the same cell. As we will see there are lots of variations on the basic sexual cycle.\nSex is not universal. Many organisms, including some very successful groups (Archaea and\nBacteria, the endomycorhizal forming Glomeromycota, most dinoflagellates, many fungi)\nhave no sexual process. While sex is generally considered to be significant to the process\nof evolution because it promotes the variation that natural selection can act upon, it is\nimportant to realize that variation and evolution can occur without sex and that the suc-\ncess of a group of organisms at one point in time, and through time, is possible even if\nthat group has no sex.\nFor multicellular or colonial organisms, reproduction, unless occurring by fragmentation\nof an already existing colony/organism, requires a cell that will proliferate and form the\ncolony/organism. In the familiar case of humans, that cell is the zygote. But in many\norganisms it is a haploid cell produced by meiosis, generally called a spore, that has the\ndevelopmental potential to proliferate and form a multicellular organism. And for all\nplants and many of the macroalgae, multicellular/colony development can proceed both\nfrom a zygote and from a haploid spore produced by meiosis. Such organisms will have\nboth a haploid stage, derived from the spore, and a diploid stage, derived from the zygote.\nThe rest of this chapter will illustrate several examples of sex and reproduction, showing\na diversity of patterns from several different groups. It is important to realize that for\nmany of the larger groups (generally phyla) that we study, in particular for the macroal- CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX | 205\ngae (green, red and brown algae), sex and reproduction are NOT consistent across the\ngroup, i.e. there is no single, standard pattern of sex and reproduction. In separate chap-\nters we will consider groups that do show some consistency: with several of the fungal\nphyla (Chapter 12), with non-seed plants (Chapter 13), with seed plants (Chapters 14 and\n15).\nChlamydomonas\nChlamydomonas is a unicellular green alga that primarily reproduces asexually (left side of\ndiagram below), i.e,. most new cells are not the product of a sexual process. On the right\nside of the diagram is shown the sexual process which is trivial in terms of reproductive\neffort but significant for the variation that it creates and also because the thick-walled\n\u2018zygospore\u2019 (so named because it develops from a zygote) is able to withstand hostile con-\nditions (dispersal in time). The sexual process is \u2018triggered\u2019 by conditions that make nor-\nmally asexual cells behave like gametes, with the ability to fuse with other cells. The only\ndiploid cell is the zygospore.\nFFiigg.. 55 SSeexxuuaall ((oonn tthhee rriigghhtt)) aanndd aasseexxuuaall ((oonn tthhee lleefftt)) rreepprroodduuccttiioonn iinn CChhllaammyyddoommoonnaass.. 206 | CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX\nOedogonium\nOedogonium, a filamentous green algae, shows the same basic patter as Chlamydomonas\nexcept that: (1) it is colonial, not unicellular, (2) in the sexual cycle the gametes do not look\nalike but are structurally very different with one (called the egg) being large and immobile\nand the other (called sperm) being much smaller and mobile. Sperm are released from the\ncolonial filament to swim to and join with the egg (syngamy). Both the egg cell and cell\nproducing sperm need to develop a hole in the cell wall in order for the sperm to escape\nand enter the egg cell. The zygote develops into a zygospore that is released from the fil-\nament and eventually undergoes meiosis and releases flagellated zoospores that, like the\nasexual zoospores, are capable of attaching to a substrate and developing into a filament,\ni.e., the cell that initiates a colonial organism is not a diploid zygote, rather it is haploid\nzoospore.\nFFiigg.. 66 SSeexxuuaall ((oonn tthhee rriigghhtt)) aanndd aasseexxuuaall ((oonn tthhee lleefftt)) rreepprroodduuccttiioonn iinn tthhee\nfifillaammeennttoouuss ggrreeeenn aallggaaee OOeeddooggoonniiuumm..

The nuclei found in the hyphae are\ndiploid and the the diploid organism is capable of reproducing asexually by producing\nstructures that produce diploid, flagellated zoospores that are mobile and capable of ger-\nminating to produce more diploid organisms. This is the primary way that the organism\nreproduces. The zoospores may also develop into cysts, dormant cells, capable of surviv-\ning conditions that the zoospores and hyphae cannot. The diploid hyphae may also be\ninduced to form enlarged spherical structures at their tips that contain a single diploid\nnucleus that undergoes meiosis. After a few additional divisions the structure now con-\ntains several haploid eggs. Chemically attracted to the egg containing structures are\nhyphae that develop enlarged hyphal ends that attach to the egg producing structure and\nwhose diploid nuclei to undergo meiosis to produce sperm. The structure also produces\nfertilization tubes that penetrate the egg containing structure and allow the haploid\nnuclei (\u2018sperm\u2019) to enter and fertilize eggs. These zygotes develop substantial cell walls\nand are termed oospores. These remain dormant and are capable of dispersal and sur-\nvival under adverse conditions. When they germinate they produce diploid hyphae.\nLaminaria\nLaminaria is an extremely large multicellular brown algae with a life cycle that departs\nslightly from that of humans and Fucus in that the products of meiosis (called meiospores)\nare not gametes and are not capable of fusing with each other. Instead they are a type of\n\u2018spore\u2019, a cell that, like some zygotes, is capable of developing, in this case developing into\na microscopic filamentous colonies that do produce gametes. This is similar to what hap-\npens in Oedogonium. In Laminaria there are two types of meiospores that develop into two\ndifferent types of filamentous gamete-producing colonies. These are not distinguishable\nby form but one produces eggs and the other produces sperm. The sperm are released to\nthe environment and are attracted to and fertilize the eggs, which may or may not have\nbeen released (if it has not been released then the filament that produces it deteriorates\nsoon after fertilization). The zygote attaches to a substrate and grows into the large kelp\nthat is typical of the species.

The haploid form produces gametes and is\ncalled a gametophyte. The diploid organism produces spores and is called a sporophyte.\nNote that both spores and zygotes show \u2018developmental potential\u2019. Spores divide and\nproduce a haploid colonial filament (the gametophyte). Zygotes divide and produce a\ndiploid multicellular kelp that is initiated in the female gametophyte that has produced\nthe egg.

It is a sheet that may be one\nor two cells thick. The gametophyte form releases sperm that are unusual because they\nlack flagella (there are no flagellated cells in the red algae). The eggs are fertilized while\nstill present on the gametophyte.

In general, this life cycle\nis like that Laminaria, there is a heteromorphic alternation of generations, but the larger,\nconspicuous form is haploid and the smaller, inconspicuous form is diploid. One inter-\nesting aspect of the Porphyra life cycle is that both the gametophyte and sporophyte are\ncapable of reproducing asexually. Another interesting aspect is that until the studies of\nKathleen Drew Baker, published in 1949, the diploid organism was described as a separate\nred algal species. Her work was fundamental to the development of commercial Porphyra\ncultivation.

As in all the red algae, sperm do not swim but are carried by water currents after\nbeing released from the male gametophyte plant. If they are able to attach to a projection\nextending from the eggs, which are produced on the female gametophyte plants, then fer-\ntilization (syngamy) occurs. The zygote then develops on the female gametophyte plant,\nproducing a very diminutive \u2018extra\u2019 diploid generation called a \u2018carposporophyte\u2019, that is\nfound on the gametophyte plant. These produce diploid carpospores that are released\nand germinate to form what is called a tetrasporophyte plant. These look identical to the\ngametophytes but are diploid. The tetrasporophyte produces haploid spores as a result of\nmeiosis and these germinate and grow into haploid gametophytes.\nThe basic pattern is an isomorphic alternation of generations but with an additional gen-\neration between the gametophyte and sporophyte (Fig. 14). Hence there are three \u2018gener-\nations\u2019, not two. Two of them are diploid and one is haploid. Several commonalities with 214 | CHAPTER 11: REPRODUCTION AND SEX\nother groups can also be pointed out, keeping in mind that none of these reflect phyloge-\nnetic relationships:\n\u2022 the zygote is retained on the on the organism that produces the egg; an analogous\nsituation is found in the life cycle of all plants and some green algae\n\u2022 one generation, the carposporophyte, is very diminutive and completes its entire\nlife as part of the organism that produced it; something comparable occurs in seed\nplants and some non-seed plants\n\u2022 the egg produces a filamentous extension that facilitates receiving sperm; a similar\nstructure is found in some of the basidiomycete (club) fungi, specifically the rusts,\nand, although they don\u2019t have \u2018typical\u2019 sperm, in the ascomycete fungi. Similarly,\nalthough it does not directly involve egg and sperm, but rather the structures that\ncontain the egg and sperm, a comparable structure is found in the stigma of flower-\ning plants.\nFig. 15 The life cycle of Polysiphonia. The dotted line separates the diploid form on the\nleft, from the haploid forms on the right. Sores, released from the tetrasporophyte,\nundergo meiosis, making haploid spores that grow into the gametophytes.

The consistency of vegetative 218 | CHAPTER 12: FUNGAL SEX AND FUNGAL GROUPS\nform makes it difficult to classify fungi because they mostly look alike, although some vary\non the basis of whether or not the filaments on coenocytic or septate (with cross walls\nand therefore cellular). However, fungi do show variation, and can be grouped, based\nupon structures that are associated with sexual reproduction. The exceptions to this are\nthe two groups where sex is either completely absent (Glomeromycota \u2014 the endomy-\ncorhizal forming fungi) or rare (Chytridomycota \u2014 the chytrids). The remaining three\ngroups (bread molds = Zygomycota, cup fungi = Ascomycota, and club fungi = Basidiomy-\ncota usually exhibit specific features associated with sexual reproduction that are used\ndefine these groups (generally considered phyla). Fungi that show no sexual features used\nto be put into a group called the \u2018Fungi Imperfecti\u2019 (Deuteromycota), but molecular tech-\nniques now allow these fungi to be placed in one of the groups mentioned above.\nFungi have the following features associated with sex and reproduction that are different\nfrom most familiar sexual organisms:\n\u2022 Reproduction often involves both sexual aspects and asexual aspects. Cells called\nspores \u2014 defined as cells with both dispersal capabilities (i.e., mobile cells) and\nreproductive capabilities (i.e., cells that can grow into new fungal organisms) are\noften important in both asexual and sexual reproduction.\n\u2022 Gametes (cells that can fuse with other gametes) are quite different from what most\nwould consider \u2018typical\u2019; they are usually hyphal cells (part of the fungal filaments)\nthat have the ability to fuse with other hyphae. Depending upon the group, these\nspecial hyphae may or may not have structural features that would distinguish them\nfrom the normal hyphae.\n\u2022 Syngamy often involves two steps separated in time and often in space. This is a\nconsequence of the fact that the fusion of the hyphae serving as gametes is generally\nnot followed immediately by the fusion of nuclei. Cellular fusion is called plas-\nmogamy and nuclear fusion is called karyogamy. Plasmogamy followed by a delayed\nkaryogamy allows fungi to have a novel condition, the dikaryon state, where a cell\nhas two nuclei (\u2018dikaryon\u2019 means \u2018two nuclei\u2019), one from each parent. This condition\nis often perpetuated: the dikaryon cell divides while both nuclei divide, thereby\nforming a new cell that is also dikaryon. This process can continue, producing mul-\ntiple dikaryon cells and dikaryon hyphae. Note that although a dikaryon cell has\ntwo copies of each chromosome, it is not considered diploid because each nucleus is\nhaploid, with only one copy of each chromosome.\n\u2022 At some point, some of the dikaryon cells become diploid as a result of the fusion CHAPTER 12: FUNGAL SEX AND FUNGAL GROUPS | 219\nof the two nuclei (karyogamy). The diploid cells are NOT perpetuated; they\nundergo meiosis to form haploid nuclei which develop walls to become haploid\ncells. Thus, the diploid state is very brief in extent (i.e., size and number of cells)\nand often brief in time as well \u2014 the diploid cells never divide mitotically to form\nmore diploid cells, they only divide meiotically to form haploid cells. These haploid\ncells are, or soon become, spores that are dispersed from the parent fungus to a new\nlocation where they germinate and form haploid hyphae.\n\u2022 \u2018Mating strains\u2019 are a common mechanism that ensures that fungi do not mate with\nthemselves. Within a particular species there are two to many mating types. A par-\nticular mating type needs to find a different mating type in order to interact sexu-\nally (i.e., fuse hyphae). The simplest situation has two mating types: \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d and\nthey need to find each other to mate, but there may be more than just two types,\ne.g., types A, B, C, D, E. And mating type A could mate with any of the others but\nnot with another A. Generally, the interaction, or lack of it, involves chemical sig-\nnals (pheromones) that are emitted by one mating type and sensed only by fungi of\na different mating type. In response to the pheromone, hyphae grow and find each\nother, bringing about plasmogamy.\nTOPICS\n\u25e6 Zygomycetes (bread molds)\n\u25e6 Ascomycetes (cup fungi)\n\u25e6 Basidiomycetes (club fungi) 220 | CHAPTER 12: FUNGAL SEX AND FUNGAL GROUPS\nZZyyggoommyycceetteess,, tthhee bbrreeaadd mmoollddss\nFFiigg.. 22 ZZyyggoommyycceettee oorrggaanniissmmss aarree ccooeennooccyyttiicc,,\nwwiitthh mmuullttiinnuucclleeaattee cceellllss eexxcceepptt iinn tthhee\nssppoorraannggiiuumm wwhhiicchh hhaass uunniinnuucclleeaattee ssppoorree\ncceellllss..\nIn the zygomycetes (Fig. 2-3), most repro-\nduction is asexual and results from the\nproduction of a stalked structure (sporan-\ngiophore) terminated with spherical spo-\nrangium. Inside the sporangium is the\nonly cellular tissue produced by the group,\nmeaning it is a structure where walls are\npresent and individual nuclei are pack-\naged one to a cell. These cells mature into\nspores that are dispersed when the spo-\nrangium disintegrates. Much less frequent\nis reproduction associated with a sexual\nprocess when a specific structure, the\nzygospore, is formed and from which the FFiigg.. 33 BBrreeaadd mmoollddss ccaann bbee ssiiggnniifificcaanntt ppeessttss ooff\nggaarrddeenn pprroodduuccee,, bbuutt ppllaayy mmaannyy ootthheerr\ngroup gets its name.

This triggers hyphae grow towards each other with the production of spe-\ncialized hyphal branches that are capable of fusing to each other. Since bread molds are\ncoenocytic, the fusion of two hyphae (plasmogamy) allows multiple nuclei to come into\nproximity (Fig 4). Unusual for the group, two cross walls, one in each of the fusing hyphae,\nform near the point of fusion, creating a single coenocytic cell with nuclei derived from\neach of the two mating strains (Fig. 5-6). This is the only dikaryon cell produced by the\nbread molds and it develops into a structure called a zygospore (Fig. 7-8) by enlarging\nslightly and developing a thick wall. Inside the zygospore haploid nuclei of one type pair\nwith nuclei of the other type and fuse (karyogamy) to form diploid nuclei, transforming\nthe cell from being dikaryon to being diploid, but it is still multinucleate. The zygospore\nis generally dormant and generally has more specific germination requirements and a\nlonger lifespan than the asexual spores. When the zygospore germinates it produces a spo-\nrangiophore comparable to those produced asexually with a sporangium at its tip. As this\ndevelops the diploid nuclei undergo meiosis and the haploid nuclei are individually pack-\naged into spores as cell walls are produced. The spores are subsequently dispersed, and\nwhen they germinate they produce haploid, coenocytic hyphae. Note that the dikaryon\nstate is limited to a single cell and has a very brief existence.\nFig. 4 When hyphae of different mating\nstrains are in proximity, pheromones\ntrigger hyphal branches of each strain to\ngrow towards each other.\nFig. 5 When the two strains make contact,\nnew cell walls (in red) form, producing\ntwo multinucleate cells at the tip of each\nbranch other. 222 | CHAPTER 12: FUNGAL SEX AND FUNGAL GROUPS\nFig. 7 When the zygospores germinate\nthe diploid nuclei undergo meiosis and\nthe zygospore produces a stalk with a\nsporangium containing haploid cells;\nthese are dispersed.\nFig. 6 The cell walls where the two\nhyphae made contact are broken down,\nplasmogamy occurs, creating a\nmultinucleate cell that is dikaryon, with\nhaploid nuclei from the two parents\npresent.

At the\nsame time the cell develops into a\nzygospore with a thick cell wall. It\nmatures and becomes dormant.\nFFiigg.. 88 WWhheenn tthhee zzyyggoossppoorreess ggeerrmmiinnaattee tthhee ddiippllooiidd nnuucclleeii\nuunnddeerrggoo mmeeiioossiiss aanndd tthhee zzyyggoossppoorree pprroodduucceess aa ssttaallkk wwiitthh aa\nssppoorraannggiiuumm ccoonnttaaiinniinngg hhaappllooiidd cceellllss;; tthheessee aarree ddiissppeerrsseedd..

When and if sexual reproduction\noccurs, it is initiated when compatible mating strains are close to each other and commu-\nnicate by pheromones. Inflated hyphal branches are produced, one on each strain, pro-\nducing cells that are slightly different in form and are multinucleate. When they are close\nto each other one of the cells produces an extension that touches the expanded cell of the\nother mating type and fuses with it (plasmogamy occurs) and haploid nuclei move from\none of the structures, termed the antheridium and considered male, to the other one,\ncalled an ascogonium and considered female. As a result of the migration of nuclei, the\narchegonium cell becomes dikaryon, with two types of nuclei, one from each parent. The\nascogonium develops extensions and two nuclei (one from each mating type) associate\nand migrate into them. A cross wall is formed, producing the first cell of what is described\nas an ascogenous hypha. These hyphae grow from the tip and remain dikaryon, with two\nhaploid nuclei per cell, a result of a coordination of tip expansion, two nuclear divisions\n(one for each nucleus), nucleus migration, and septum formation. Growth of the ascog-\nneous hyphae plus growth of both (haploid) parental hyphae produce a fruiting body of\ndensely intertwined hyphae. The size of the fruiting body ranges tremendously in size,\nfrom roughly 100 um to 10 cm or more, with most at the smaller end. The size and shape\nvary and can be used to identify species. The common name for the group (\u2018cup fungi\u2019)\nrelates to a cup shaped fruiting body. Cup fungi are found both living independently and\nalso as the fungal partner of a number of lichens; many lichens produce ascocarps (Fig. 10) 224 | CHAPTER 12: FUNGAL SEX AND FUNGAL GROUPS\nthat are relatively large and visible to the naked eye. Other fruiting bodies are flask-\nshaped or completely closed and typically are less than a mm in extent.\nIn a specific part of this fruiting body the\nsexual cycle is completed. The tips of the\nascogenous hyphae form a hook, turning\nback on itself and the two nuclei fuse\n(karyogamy occurs) in the cell that has\nformed the hook (crozier), making it\n(briefly) a diploid cell. The only diploid\ncells found in the Ascomycota are these\nFFiigg.. 1100 AA lliicchheenn sshhoowwiinngg \u2018\u2018ffaaiirryy ccuuppss\u2019\u2019,, wwhhiicchh\nspecific cells, eventually called asci (singu-\naarree aaccttuuaallllyy tthhee ccuupp--sshhaappeedd aassccooccaarrppss ooff tthhee\nlar = ascus) situated at the ends of the ffuunnggaall ccoommppoonneenntt ooff tthhiiss ccoommppoossiittee\noorrggaanniissmm..\nascogenous hyphae. These hyphae produce\nno additional cells after forming the hook.\nThe diploid cell elongates and then undergoes meiosis to form an elongate cell with four\nhaploid nuclei. Each of these then go through mitosis to produce an elongate cell called\nan ascus with eight haploid nuclei in a row. Each nucleus acquires a cell wall and develop\ninto what is called an ascospore. Asci with eight ascospores are diagnostic for the Ascomy-\ncota.\nHydrostatic pressure within the ascus causes ascospores to be forcibly dispersed when the\ntip of the ascus ruptures. Dispersed ascospores germinate to form haploid hyphae, which\nform haploid mycelia which may reproduce asexually via conidia or other spores. If a hap-\nloid mycelium comes in contact with hyphae of a different mating type, sexual reproduc-\ntion may be triggered.

When the two nuclei divide the arch allows one of the two nuclei to move to the\nparental cell as septa form. This ensures that both the daughter cell and mother cell has\none of each type of nucleus.\nRecall that that there is only a single dikaryon cell in the bread molds (Zygomycota) and\nthe only dikaryon cells of the the cup fungi (Ascomycota) are found in the fruiting bod\nies. Thus, if one encounters a dikaryotic hyphae outside of a fruiting body then it must\nbe long to a club fungus (Basidiomycota). The dikaryotic hyphae of club fungi grow and\nfeed extensively until appropriate conditions are encountered to trigger \u2018fruiting\u2019.

Somewhere on or in the dense mass of hyphae special\ncells are produced, termed basidia, that are \u2018club-shaped\u2019 (Fig. 18). Inside these cells karyo-\ngamy occurs, transforming them into diploid cells. The diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis\nto produce four haploid nuclei, but no cytokinesis occurs, making the basidium \u2018quadra-\nnucleate\u2019. Four extensions grow out of the basidium and the four nuclei migrate into these.\nThis is followed by cell wall formation to produce a basidium with no nucleus but with\nfour loosely attached haploid cells, called basidiospores, extending off from them. The\nspores are ballistically released and are dispersed by the wind. When they germinate they\nform new haploid hyphae.\nUnlike the cup fungi, whose fruiting bodies are generally small and not typically noticed,\nthe fruiting bodies of many club fungi are often relatively large, 10-30 cm and have char-\nacteristic shapes that we describe as mushrooms (with a stalk and a cap) (Fig. 19-20) or\nbracket fungi (roughly hoof shaped and attached without a stalk to the trunks of woody\nplants). Two very common patterns of basidia distribution are (1) extending from thin\nfins of tissue termed \u2018gills\u2019, typical of the commercially available mushroom, or (2) basidia\nextending from tubes (cylinders) of tissue which, when viewed at the surface, appear as\nnumerous pores.\nFFiigg.. 1199 TThhee flflyy aaggaarriicc mmuusshhrroooomm,, wwiitthh pprroommiinneenntt ggiillllss..

Most commonly this happens\nas a consequence of the plant being severed into pieces and these pieces being able to\nregenerate the parts that were lost. Additionally, some species have developed pieces that\nare particularly prone to be broken off, e.g., the gemmae (singular of gemma) of some\nmosses and liverworts. It is relatively common for flowering plants to produce asexual\npropagules in the places where seeds normally develop, producing seed-like structures\nwithout the normal process of sex. Although reproduction without sex is common in\nplants and for some species it represents their sole means of reproduction, most plants\nrely on sexual reproduction, and two innovations, the seed and the flower, have been par-\nticularly significant to the evolution of plants.\nWith respect to sex, the plant kingdom illustrates wonderful patterns of unity and diver-\nsification. On the one hand, all plant life shows a fundamentally similar pattern of sex, on\nthe other hand, plants illustrate remarkable diversification of this common theme.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Alternation of generations\n\u2022 Mosses, liverworts and hornworts\n\u2022 Ferns\n\u2022 Horsetails\n\u2022 Clubmosses\nAll plants exhibit alternation of generation s, they produce two types of multicellular\norganisms: one diploid and derived from the development of a zygote, and one haploid\nand derived from the development of a haploid cell called a spore. \u2018Development\u2019 involves 236 | CHAPTER 13: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN NON-SEED PLANTS\nthe proliferation of cells, the differentiation of cells and the formation specific structures\nwith specific roles, i.e.. morphogenesis.\nAll plants exhibit alternation of generations and alternate between haploid and diploid\norganisms. To complete the sexual cycle the haploid organism must produce gametes that\nunite to form the zygote. That is, among all the haploid cells that are produced as a result\nof cell divisions of a haploid spore, some of the cells are endowed with special capabil-\nities that allow them to encounter and interact with another gamete to form a zygote.\nSimilarly, of all the diploid cells derived from the zygote, some, called a \u2018spore mother\ncells\u2019, are endowed with the ability to undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, spores,\nthat grow into haploid individuals. Note that meiosis does NOT produce gametes, rather\nit produces spores that are dispersed and develop into haploid plants. The diploid plant\nthat produces spore mother cells and spores is called a \u2018sporophyte\u2019. The gamete-produc-\ning organism, which is haploid, is called a gametophyte. Thus, there is an \u2018alternation of\ngenerations\u2019 with a haploid form alternating with a diploid form (Figure 1). Often one of\nthe two forms is challenging to appreciate, largely because they are often challenging to\nsee \u2014 they are often small, short-lived, and may not live a separate existence from the pre-\nvious generation. That is, the haploid and diploid forms may not spatially distinct from\neach other; they may be temporarily, or permanently, a part of their parent!\nLike those of familiar animals, the gametes of all plants are of two types, a larger, immo-\nbile egg and a smaller sperm that must in some way be mobile in order to encounter the\negg. The gametophytes of plants may be bisexual (hermaphrodites), producing both egg\nand sperm, or unisexual, i.e., there are separate male and female gametophytes. In some\nplant groups, including all of those discussed in this chapter, the sperm is mobile because\nthey possess flagella. Sperm swim away from the male gametophyte that produced it\nand are chemically attracted to the structure producing eggs. Because plants are terrestrial\norganisms, the water required for a flagellated sperm to swim to the egg but water is not\nalways present. We will see in the next chapter that some plants have circumvented this\nproblem by having male gametophytes become mobile, not the sperm they produce.\nAs in animals, the female gamete, the egg, does not move. It is retained in the organism\nthat produces it. In the case of plants this is a haploid gametophyte (not a diploid individ-\nual as in mammals). And in some of the plants discussed in this chapter the zygote formed\nby the fertilization of an egg grows out of the archegonium (the structure in which an egg\nis produced) and produces a sporophyte attached to the gametophyte. Alternatively, the\nentire (female) gametophyte of some plant groups is embedded in the diploid plant (the CHAPTER 13: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN NON-SEED PLANTS | 237\nFFiigg.. 11 AAlltteerrnnaattiioonn ooff ggeenneerraattiioonnss:: tthhee sseexxuuaall ccyyccllee eexxhhiibbiitteedd bbyy aallll ppllaannttss aass wweellll aass pprroottiissttss..\nsporophyte) that produced the spore that developed into the female gametophyte. That\nis, in some plant groups, the spores produced by sporophytes are not dispersed; instead\nthe spore germinates where it is produced and grows to produce a gametophyte plant on\nor inside a sporophyte plant. Mobile male gametophytes and sedentary female gameto-\nphytes are features of a very few of the non-seed plants discussed in this chapter but are\nubiquitous in seed plants, discussed in the next two chapters. In this chapter we consider\nthe more readily observable and understandable alternation of generations that is found\nin plants without seeds. 238 | CHAPTER 13: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN NON-SEED PLANTS\nMMoosssseess LLiivveerrwwoorrttss aanndd HHoorrnnwwoorrttss\nIn mosses, liverworts and hornworts (the\nthree groups of plants lacking vascular tis-\nsue) it is the gametophyte plant that lives\nthe longest and is the most visible. It pro-\nduces a form capable of gathering materi-\nals for growth, primarily through\nphotosynthesis (Fig. 2). The most common\nform, found in all mosses and many liver-\nworts, is an elongate axis bearing flaps of\ntissue that increase the photosynthetic\narea. At some point, often once a year, the\ngametophyte produces gamete producing\nstructures that are called archegonia (sin-\ngular = archegonium) if they produce eggs\nand antheridia (singular = antheridium) if\nthey produce sperm. These structures are\ntypically produced in the midst of modi-\nfied \u2018leaves\u2019 at ends of stems/branches in\nFFiigg.. 22 AA mmoossss ggaammeettoopphhyyttee,, sshhoowwiinngg aa ttyyppiiccaall\nmosses or, in some liverworts, they occur\n\u2018\u2018sstteemm wwiitthh lleeaavveess\u2019\u2019 ccoonnssttrruuccttiioonn..\non the underside of umbrella/mushroom-\nshaped structures that extend upwards from the main body of liverworts.. The antheridia\n(Fig. 3) are roughly spherical containers in which cells differentiate into flagellated sperm\nand are released when the antheridia break open. The archegonia are flask shaped struc-\ntures with a single egg near the base and an elongate neck that develops a canal through\nwhich sperm can swim in order to fertilize the egg. The resulting zygote develops inside\nthe archegonium, producing a sporophyte that eventually extends typically one to six cm\nbeyond the archegonium and exists as an appendage of the gametophyte, never liv ing an\nexistence independent from it. Although the sporophyte sometimes is green and capable\nof photosynthesis for part of its life, its structure, a simple stalk with no \u2018leaves\u2019 to increase\nsurface area, is not particularly suited for photosynthesis. Rather the structure is suited\nfor the dispersal of spores; the stalk usually elevates the capsule, which is the site where\nspore mother cells develop, undergo meiosis, and produce spores.

But, in light of the sexual cycle and pattern of alternation of generations, it is\nhelpful to consider them to be separate organisms. This is supported by fact that they\nhave a different number of chromosomes than the gametophyte that they grow out of.\nIn all other plants besides mosses, liverworts and hornworts it is the spore producing\nplant that lives the longest and is the most visible; it is the form that we see and recognize\nas a plant. The sporophyte still begins its development growing out of the archegonium\nwhere the egg was produced and was fertilized, but the sporophyte\u2019s growth is such that it\nbecomes completely independent of the gametophyte that it emerges from and eventually\nhas a completely autonomous existence. Thus, when we see ferns, horsetails, club-mosses,\nand seed plants, what we are observing is a diploid plant that produces spores. In all these\ngroups the gametophyte is small and elusive but the basic life cycle is the same as in all 240 | CHAPTER 13: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN NON-SEED PLANTS\nFFiigg.. 44 TThhee ttyyppee ooff aa mmoossss \u2018\u2018sstteemm\u2019\u2019 sshhoowwiinngg ttyyppiiccaall mmoossss aarrcchheeggoonniiaa,, oonnee wwiitthh aann eegggg..

It lacks a stem axis and is often \u2018heart-shaped\u2019 (Fig. 6-8 and\n11). It is generally attached to a substrate via rhizoids (filaments of non-photosynthetic\ncells).

It is important to note that gametes are not pro-\nduced by meiosis because all the cells of the gametophyte are haploid already.\nFern gametophytes are generally have flask shaped female structures (archegonia) located\nin the notch between the lobes and globular male structures (antheridia) located on the\non the lobes. While most fern gametophytes are hermaphroditic, some are unisexual and\nfor some their sexual expression depends on environmental conditions. All the cells of\nthe gametophyte are haploid but it produces a cell, the egg, with special developmental\nabilities. The antheridia release sperm that have flagella which allow them to swim to the\narchegonia, where the eggs are located, and swim down a narrow canal to fuse with the\negg cell at its base. The zygote develops into a sporophyte, producing stems and roots. The\nstems produce leaves which shade the gametophyte and it soon dies (Fig. 9)\nThe sporophyte continues to grow to produce the fern that we recognize. It has the same\nstructure as most plants: a root-shoot axis with leaves produced by the shoot.

When these germinate, they grow into haploid gametophytes\nand the process is repeated. Generally, the sporangia are produced in clusters called \u2018fruit\ndots\u2019 that are located on the underside of leaves (see wood fern). Other ferns have entire\nportions of their leaves that are obviously different and where spores are produced. A few\nferns in this area are dimorphic (see sensitive fern), producing two types of leaves, some\nthat are green and photosynthetic and which never produce spores and other leaves that\nare non-photosynthetic and produce abundant spores, while being nourished by the pho-\ntosynthetic part of plant.\nWhile this is the general pattern for ferns, there is some variation, one example of which is\nthe water fern Marsilea, an aquatic fern that has several interesting features (see the infor-\nmation sheet on Marsilea). As is the case in a number of ferns, spores are produced on a\nspecialized leaf that is very different looking from normal photosynthetic leaves.

It produces a sin-\ngle archegonium with a single egg that the sperm swims to and fertilizes, forming a zygote.\nWhile the new sporophyte plant seemingly sprouts from the female spore, it actually is\ncoming from a female gametophyte that is growing inside the spore case. 248 | CHAPTER 13: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN NON-SEED PLANTS\nFurther Reading\n\u201cMarsilea: Habitat, External Features and Reproduction\u201d on Biology Discus-\nsion.com\n\u2022 http://www.biologydiscussion.com/pteridophytes/marsilea-habitat-exter-\nnal-features-and-reproduction/53235\nAnother interesting fern is the Appalachian bristle fern, which is only known from the\ngametophyte form.

Germination of the spore produces a small (~ 1-3 cm) photosynthetic gametophyte\nthat looks like a pin cushion. Very short \u2018stems\u2019 are present with appendages that increase\nphotosynthetic area. Antheridia and archegonia are usually both produced from the same\ngametophyte, although it may be unisexual for a period of time. Sperm are multi \u2013 flagel-\nlated and need to swim to reach the egg. Fertilization results in a zygote that develops into\na diploid sporophyte that soon overgrows the gametophyte that it emerges from, produc-\ning roots and both horizontal stems (rhizomes) and vertical stems.\nCClluubbmmoosssseess,, SSppiikkeemmoosssseess aanndd QQuuiillllwwoorrttss\nThe se three groups are thought to be closely related and are grouped together as\n\u2018Lycopods\u2019 or \u2018Lycophytes\u2019, a group that also includes a number of fossil forms, including\ntree-like forms that were very important at the end of the Paleozoic era. The group has\n1200 species and is considerably more diverse than the horsetails but much less diverse\nthan the ferns (12,000 species). The sporophytes of extant clubmosses, spike mosses and\nquillworts are all herbaceous perennials. They generally spread extensively with above-\nground and below-ground stems (tropical members are usually epiphytes). Although\nancient members of the group exhibited woody growth, none of the species alive today\ndo.\nClubmosses (Fig. 13) are unique in having gametophytes that are subterranean and non-\nphotosynthetic, surviving as parasites by feeding off of fungi. These gametophytes live\nmuch longer than most gametophytes of vascular plants, some over 15 years. Spikemosses\nand quillworts are heterosporous and, like the aquatic fern Marsilea, the gametophytes\ndevelop endosporically; living off the material that was provisioned in the spore by the\nsporophyte plant. The male gametophyte is very short-lived and has little stored mater-\nial (the microspore is small), but the female gametophyte is considerably bigger and lives\nfor months on material present in the spore. Early growth of the sporophyte, out of the\nfemale gametophyte that is present in a megaspore, looks like a germinating seed (Fig.\n14) and we will see in the next chapter that these are analogies \u2014 it is not thought that\nseed plants developed from the lycopods. Another feature of some spikemosses is that the\n\u2018female\u2019 spores, the ones that develop into female gametophytes, sometimes develop ON\nthe sporophyte plant, a nother feature that is repeated in seed plants. 250 | CHAPTER 13: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN NON-SEED PLANTS\nFFiigg.. 1133 SSoommee cclluubbmmoosssseess llooookk lliikkee mmoosssseess bbuutt tthheeyy aarree bbiiggggeerr,,\noofftteenn uupp ttoo 2255 ccmm ttaallll..

This figure\nFig. 1 Familiar seeds of pea, corn and bean\ncompares a pea seed to a typical mustard\nhave been selected for thousands of years\nseed.\nfor large size.\nSuperficially, the production of seeds (Fig. 1-2)\nresembles the production of offspring in familiar animals: inside a diploid parent there\ndevelops a member of the \u2018next generation\u2019, which is nurtured inside its parent during the\ncritical early stages of development and then is deposited outside its parent to finish its\nlife. But appreciate that all plants exhibit an alternation of generations, so if a diploid\n(sporophyte) plant produces a new diploid (sporophyte) plant in a seed, one must account\nfor the haploid gametophyte generation that had to come in between the two sporophyte\ngenerations. And one must also appreciate that seeds are NOT a substitute for spores, in\nfact, spores are critical to the production of seeds. The appearance of seeds (both in the\nsense of evolution and in the sense of development) is a complex story, one that involves\nthe pattern of \u2018alternation of generations\u2019 shown in all plants. In light of this pattern,\nseeds represent a \u2018babushka\u2019 (Russian doll) with multiple generations found inside each\nother. An appreciation of this \u2018generation within a generation\u2019 is essential in understand-\ning \u2018how seeds came to be\u2019 both evolutionarily and developmentally. 254 | CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS\nWhile it was long assumed that a structure as complex as seeds evolved once, many now\nfeel that seeds evolved multiple times. Seeds therefore may represent an example of con-\nvergent evolution, where multiple lines have converged on a common feature. Whether or\nnot this is actually the case, we can cite several features that allowed seeds to evolve and\nsome of these features are exhibited in groups that do not produce seeds. Central to the\nappearance of seeds, in both a developmental and evolutionary sense, is the appearance\nof ovules, dynamic entities whose composition changes, ultimately ending up as a seed.\nIn this chapter, we consider the transformations in the life cycle of plants that allowed\nfor the development of seeds. In the next chapter, we consider the specific structures and\npatterns seen in conifers and flowering plants. Although we are focused on the seed, we\nwill also consider a companion entity that is essential for the development of seeds: the\npollen grain, which we will see is a miniaturized mobile, male gametophyte.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Seed Structure\n\u2022 Reduction\n\u2022 Retention\n\u2022 Arrested Development\n\u2022 Provisioning\n\u2022 Packaging\nSSeeeedd SSttrruuccttuurree\nA seed consists of three components: an embryonic sporophyte plant, a tissue that pro-\nvides nutrition to that embryo, and a \u2018seed coat\u2019, the container tissue in which the embryo\nand nutritive tissue develop. The embryonic plant is diploid and it develops from a zygote\nformed by the union of egg and sperm. The seed coat is also diploid and it also is derived\nfrom a sporophyte plant, but it is an earlier sporophyte generation than the embryo. In\nboth a temporal and also in a physical sense, a seed is a generation \u2018babushka, a Russ-\nian doll\u2019, with \u2018nested\u2019 generations. There are two sporophyte generations, the older one\n(seed coat) on the outside, and the new one (embryo) on the inside, with a gametophyte\ngeneration, or remnants of one, sandwiched between them. Seeds are the consequence\nof the megaspores not being dispersed but instead being retained in the sporophyte that CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS | 255\nFFiigg.. 33 SSeeeedd ssttrruuccttuurree ooff aa ddiiccoott,, sshhoowwiinngg ttwwoo\nccoottyylleeddoonnss aanndd aa rroooott//sshhoooott aaxxiiss\nproduces them. The spores germinate and egg-producing female gametophytes are conse-\nquently present on/in the sporophyte. Later, embryos, resulting from the fertilization of\neggs produced by the gametophytes, are also present on/in the sporophyte. The structure\nwhere the retained spore is located and where the seed ultimately develops is called an\novule. Ultimately ovules develop into seeds containing a new sporophyte \u2018packaged\u2019 in the\nseed coat, a tissue derived from the original sporophyte. Prior to this, an ovule contains a\nfemale gametophyte; prior to this, ovules contain a spore that produces a female gameto-\nphyte; earlier still, they contain a megaspore mother cell that produces that spore. Finding\ngametophytes, both male and female, and understanding their development is key to the\nunderstanding of both the evolution and development of seeds.\nSeed plants and their ancestors are heterosporous, producing two types of spores that\ndevelop into two types of gametophytes, one male and one female. Both the evolution\nof seeds and the development of any individual seed involve modifications of both the\nmale and the female gametophyte, modifications in the structures that produce them, and\nmodifications of the timing and location of important developmental processes.\nWe can describe the transformations that allowed for the evolution of seeds and also allow\nfor the development of seeds with the acronym RRAPP: Reduction, Retention, Arrested\ndevelopment, Provisioning, Packaging. 256 | CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS\nFFiigg.. 44 AA ccoommppaarriissoonn ooff lliiffee ccyycclleess iinn sseeeedd ppllaannttss aanndd nnoonn--sseeeedd ppllaannttss.. CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS | 257\nRReedduuccttiioonn\nBoth the male and female gametophyte of seed plants are greatly reduced in size when\ncompared to the gametophytes of other plants. The gametophytes of most plant groups\nare less apparent than the sporophytes, but in the seed plants they are so reduced that\nthe pattern of alternation of generations is hard to see, and the misconception that plants\nreproduce like familiar animals, i.e. that there is no alternation of generations, that the\nonly haploid cells are egg and sperm, is often assumed. The male gametophyte of seed\nplants is pollen, an organism of 3-6 cells that initiates its development from a spore\non one sporophyte plant and completes its development on another sporophyte plant,\nin a location near that of the female gametophyte. For some groups, pollen releases a\nmobile, flagellated, sperm, but for the familiar groups, flowering plants and conifers, the\nmale gametophyte is comparable to fungi in the sense that the gametophyte grows to (as\nopposed to swims to) the egg cell of the female gametophyte, fuses with it, and donates\na sperm nucleus that joins with the nucleus of the egg cell to form a diploid zygote.\nAlthough the size of the male gametophyte is much reduced, it may live up to a year in\nconifers, starting its life on one sporophyte and ending it on another sporophyte.\nThe female gametophyte of seed plants is also severely reduced: it is only seven cells in\nflowering plants but may exceed one thousand cells in conifers. In all seed plants, the\nfemale gametophyte exists solely inside tissues of the sporophyte that produced it, having\nno independent existence whatsoever. Besides the reduction in size of the female gameto-\nphyte, there is also a reduction in the number of female gametophytes that are produced\nby any specific megasporangium. Remember that female gametophytes grow from megas-\npores that are produced after a meiotic \u2018cell division\u2019 (it actually is a process involving\ntwo cell divisions) of a megaspore mother cell. In all seed plants, only a single megaspore\nmother cell is produced inside the megasporangium. And although, typically, a megas-\npore mother cell produces four spores after meiosis, in seed plants three of the haploid\nnuclei degenerate after meiosis, leaving a single megaspore inside the megasporangium.\nIts structure is not at all spore-like, having no special spore wall at all; it has no need for\nprotection because it is always buried inside of sporophyte tissue. Similarly, the megaspo-\nrangium, the container in which megaspores develop, is very different from the sporangia\nof non-seed pants because it is not a container exposed to the environment but instead is\na container embedded in sporophyte tissue. The development of the female gametophyte\nof seed plants occurs in an ovule, inside the megasporangium that develops in the ovule. 258 | CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS\nIn seed plants, the megasporangium is called a nucellus, and in some groups, the nucellus\nremains as a feature of the fully developed seed.\nRReetteennttiioonn\nThere are multiple retention steps involved in the production of seeds and only the final\nsteps are specific to just seed plants. First, there must be retention of the egg in the\norganism that produces it. In organisms that have gametes differentiated into a \u2018sperm\u2019\n(a mobile, usually flagellated, cell that is released from the organism that produces it)\nand \u2018egg\u2019 (defined as a gamete that is larger and immobile), retention of the egg is often\n(e.g., Oedogonium, water molds), but not always (e.g., Fucus), the case. Retention of the egg\nrequires that fertilization occurs in/on the egg-producing organism. This is the case for\nmammals. For organisms that show alternation of generations, this means that the egg is\nfertilized in the gametophyte. The next retention found is a characteristic of all plants\nand is why the group is sometimes referred to as \u2018embryophytes\u2019. It is the retention of the\nzygote, and the embryo that grows from it, in the female gametophyte plant. The reten-\ntion of the egg, zygote, and embryo in the gametophyte allows the early development of\nthe diploid generation to occur in a more controlled environment, with resources pro-\nvided by the gametophyte. Note that this retention results in a sporophyte growing from\na gametophyte, again something that is found in all plants.\nThe next retention step is the retention of the gametophyte on a spore-producing plant.\nGametophytes develop from spores produced in a spore case (sporangium) present in/\non a sporophyte plant. In seed-producing plants (and a very few non-seed producing\nplants, e.g., some spikemosses) gametophytes are retained on the sporophyte plant that\nproduces them because the spore is retained in, not dispersed from, the sporangium of\nthe spore-producing plant. For the female gametophytes of seed plants this retention is\npermanent, the female gametophyte is only found living on/in a sporophyte plant, in a\nmegasporangium, the structure where the megaspores (the large spores that develop into\nfemale gametophytes) were produced. The male gametophyte also exhibits retention, but\nonly temporarily; microspores (small spores that develop into male gametophytes) are\nretained in the microsporangium of the parent (sporophyte) plant and the initial develop-\nment of the male gametophyte occurs there to produce a pollen grain. It is then dispersed\nand completes its development on another sporophyte plant, in the structure where the\nfemale gametophyte is found (the female cone of conifers, the flower of angiosperms). CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS | 259\nAArrrreesstteedd ddeevveellooppmmeenntt\nAn essential aspect of reproduction is dispersal. Especially for plants, with their indeter-\nminate lifestyle, reproduction is of little significance unless there is a potential of dis-\npersing to a new location. Dispersal is a significant aspect of sex as well. Although the\nprocesses of syngamy and meiosis can generate variability even when self-fertilization\noccurs, it is far more effective in producing variation, the raw material of evolution, if\ngenetically distinct organisms participate. For sedentary plants, this requires movement\nof one individual to another, i.e., dispersal. For non-seed plants, dispersal is affected by\ntwo dispersal agents, the spore and the sperm. Spores have a tremendous dispersal ability\nbecause they are small and can be (generally) dispersed by the wind over large distances.\nThis is only possible because the living thing inside the spore, the single cell, is extremely\n\u2018life-less\u2019; that is, if one were to observe it, one would see very little biological activity.\nMetabolism is minimal, very few chemical reactions are occurring; it is a very stable struc-\nture and is in a state of \u2018suspended animation\u2019, the normal functions of life have been sus-\npended temporarily. These life functions resume if the spore reaches a habitat that can\ntrigger spore germination, which returns the spore to the animated state. In contrast, the\nother mobile agent of non-seed plants, sperm, are highly animated, they have a very sub-\nstantial metabolic rate, not just because of their mobility (metabolism is required in order\nfor the flagella to move) but their overall structure, in terms of organization of the mem-\nbranes and cytosol, is much more typical of living things than that of dormant spores.\nSperm are consuming stored energy supplies (\u2018food\u2019) in order to sustain their life func-\ntions. Since sperm have a very limited ability to acquire food, their lifespan is set by the\namount of the stored reserves that they are provisioned with when dispersed. The conse-\nquence is that sperm do not live very long and do not move very far.\nSeed plants also have two dispersal agents: the seed and pollen. Both of them are \u2018in sus-\npended animation\u2019 in the same way that spores are. This allows both of them to travel\nsubstantial distances. It is significant that both the seed and the pollen are not single cells,\nthey are partially developed organisms that have begun their development on a \u2018parent\u2019\nplant, yet have arrested their development and entered a \u2018resting stage\u2019 where they can\nsurvive adverse conditions and live without any additional resources. While the produc-\ntion of dormant cells (e.g., spores) are found in diverse groups of organisms, arresting\ndevelopment of a multicellular organism and having it enter a dormant stage is much less\ncommon, but it is essential to the development of seeds. Male gametophytes start their\ndevelopment inside the sporophyte plant when microspores are produced and develop 260 | CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS\ninto pollen. They are then dispersed in a dormant state, only to be revived if they reach\nthe site of a female gametophyte, located on/in a sporophyte plant. Here, their develop-\nment resumes, and they are able to produce a cell that can fertilize the egg.\nSimilarly, the new sporophyte generation found in a seed exhibits arrested development.\nAfter fertilization, the zygote that is produced generally quickly divides and develops into\nan embryo with a root/shoot axis, root and shoot apical meristems, and one or two leaves\nthat are \u2018seed leaves\u2019 = cotyledons. Then the development ceases, no cell division or differ-\nentiation occurs in spite of the fact that nutrients are available and environmental condi-\ntions are favorable, at least temporarily. The metabolic rate drops to very low levels and\nthe tolerance of the embryo to extremes in temperature, etc., substantially increases. In\nthis state, the seed is dispersed, and it only resumes growth and development if conditions\nfavorable to germination are met.\nPPrroovviissiioonniinngg\nSeeds contain nutrients, both nutrients that can \u2018supply energy\u2019, i.e. materials that can be\nused in cellular respiration, and nutrients that are building materials for the construction\nof more plant cells. These energy and material supplies are very significant to a young\nautotroph because \u2018it takes money to make money\u2019 : in order to feed itself a plant needs\nstructure but the structure isn\u2019t possible without energy and material supplies. Provision-\ning allows an organism to produce a structure that can obtain matter and energy on its\nown. Provisioning is accomplished in spores, but to a lesser extent; they do possess some\nmaterials, but the quantities are limited because the spore is generally only a single cell\nand generally small in size to promote dispersal.\nSeeds are provisioned with materials that are stored in several different tissues:\n1. Materials can be stored in the female gametophyte which sometimes is a compo-\nnent of the seed: in conifer seeds, the female gametophyte is a structure of roughly\n1000 cells, all of which can store materials,\n2. Material can be stored in the embryo itself, specifically in the cotyledon(s), the \u2018seed\nleaf / leaves\u2019 produced by the embryonic plant while growing inside the seed. In\nmany angiosperms, the cotyledon(s) enlarge during development and store a sub-\nstantial amount of materials. Many of our crop species possess large cotyledons that\ntake up most of the seed volume and possess most of the stored material. CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS | 261\n3. Material can be stored in the endosperm tissue, a unique tissue found in the seeds\nof angiosperms that are formed as a result of a second fertilization event, besides\nthe one that created the zygote. The next chapter will discuss how this tissue is\nformed and develops. Although all angiosperms have endosperm tissue at some\npoint in their development, some angiosperms lose their endosperm as the cotyle-\ndons expand and the seed is left with enlarged cotyledon(s) but little endosperm.\nWherever/however they are stored, the\nnutrients come from the parent sporo-\nphyte plant via phloem tissue. Careful\nexamination of developing seeds will\nreveal that each is attached to the parent\nplant via a vascular thread.\nPPaacckkaaggiinngg\nSeeds are eventually dispersed as a pack-\nage inside of which is an embryo and\nFFiigg.. 55 NNoottee tthhee vvaassccuullaarr ttrraacceess ((\u2018\u2018tthhrreeaaddss\u2019\u2019)) tthhaatt stored food.

Part of the transformation of an ovule into a seed is the transformation\nof the integuments (or part of the integuments) into a seed coat. The seed coat develops\nthrough a process of cell division and differentiation to form what is usually a rigid out-\nside coating of the seed. These cells usually have thick secondary cell walls.\nThus, a seed is an embryo and stored food enclosed in a seed coat. The development\nof a seed, also known as the ripening of an ovule, involves three distinct developmental\nprocesses:\n1. The development of a zygote into an embryo. The zygote is the new sporophyte\ngeneration. It divides to produce new cells and these grow and develop to produce\nan embryo with both a root and shoot apical meristem and one to several leaves, 262 | CHAPTER 14: THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS\ncalled cotyledons, or seed leaves.\n2. The transformation of the sporophyte tissues of the ovule into a seed coat. This\ntypically involves the production of new cells, allowing for the ovule to increase in\nsize, and the differentiation of these cells to produce a protective container.\n3. The development of nutritive tissue to supply materials to the seed after it has been\ndispersed. As mentioned above, the nutritive tissue develops from different sources\nin different seeds but it always involves a proliferation of cells and an expansion of\nthese cells as the material is supplied to them from the parental sporophyte.\nPlants with seeds have been successful for multiple reasons including: (1) the early devel-\nopment of the sporophyte occurs in a very protected location inside of the previous\nsporophyte generation, (2) two items are dispersed: pollen, whose dispersal is focused on\ngetting gametes together, and seeds, whose dispersal is focused on getting the next gener-\nation of sporophytes to new locations, (3) seeds are dispersed in a package that generally\ncontains substantial quantities of nutrients, increasing the likelihood that the next\nsporophyte generation will be able to become established.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cThe Seed Biology Place\u201d by Gerhard Leubner\n\u25e6 http://www.seedbiology.de/index.html\n\u2022 Ancient date palm seeds.\n\u25e6 http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/57817\n\u2022 \u201cThe Surprising Lives of Cycads\u201d by Jennifer Frazer.

CHAPTER 15: SEX AND\nREPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS\nSeeds are a remarkable innovation that have been highly important to the evolution of\nplant life. The vast majority of plants that we observe and utilize possess seeds and seed\nplants dominate most terrestrial habitats. The last chapter described in general terms\nwhat seeds are and what modifications in the general plant life cycle of alternation of gen-\nerations had to occur in order for seeds to appear. This chapter fills in some of the details\nfor the five groups of seed plants:\n\u2022 flowering plants, with 250,000 species, by far the most diverse and ubiquitous plant\ngroup\n\u2022 conifers, although with only 1000 species, they are very commonly encountered and\necologically and economically important\n\u2022 cycads, a small group of around 300 species with limited distribution and impor-\ntance\n\u2022 gnetophytes, a small group of only three genera and around 100 species\n\u2022 Ginkgo, a single species that survives only where cultivated\nIn addition to these five extant groups, there are several groups of seed plants well rep-\nresented in fossils but no longer present. These extinct species are sometimes lumped as\n\u2018seed ferns,\u2019 but both the lumping and the designation as a group are not thought to be\naccurate: they are not closely aligned with ferns and they probably represent an artifi-\ncial (polyphyletic) grouping. Most workers believe that seeds evolved more than once and\ntherefore that there should be no phylogenetic entity corresponding to either seed plants\nor to gymnosperms (i.e., seed plants lacking flowers) although these categories do per-\nsist. We will consider the details of the life cycle, in particular the form of the female\ngametophyte and the mechanisms associated with pollination and fertilization, for the\nfive groups of extant seed plants.

The\nplants that are recognized as pines are diploid,\nsporophyte plants. All conifers, including pines,\nare heterosporous and produce two kinds of\nspores, both on the same tree. The sites of spore\nproduction are the cones. The cones that most\npeople recognize as \u2018pine cones\u2019 are female pine\ncones. These are not only the site of megaspore\nproduction but also the site of: megaspore ger-\nmination that forms a gametophyte, egg pro-\nduction by that gametophyte, egg fertilization,\nand ultimately seed development. All these\nevents take place in a location described as an\novule. These processes generally take multiple\nFFiigg.. 11 YYoouunngg ffeemmaallee ppiinnee ccoonnee aatt tthhee\nyears and the structures one usually recognizes\nssttaaggee wwhheerree iitt wwoouulldd bbee ppoolllliinnaatteedd..\nFFeemmaallee ccoonneess aappppeeaarr iinn tthhee sspprriinngg aatt as pine cones have been living and developing\ntthhee ttiipp ooff nneewwllyy eelloonnggaatteedd bbrraanncchheess..\nover a time of two years or more, with many of\nBBeellooww tthhee ccoonnee aarree cclluusstteerrss ooff lleeaavveess\nthe significant events occurring when the cone\njjuusstt ssttaarrttiinngg ttoo eexxppaanndd..\nis much smaller and not as easily observed (Fig\n1). A female cone consists of an axis (stem) bearing scales subtended by bracts, with the 266 | CHAPTER 15: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS\nscales thought to be derivatives of modified branches. Upon the upper surface of the scale\nare the ovules, the structures that develop into seeds.\nMale spores are produced in less familiar,\nbut certainly easily observed, male pine\ncones, which grow more quickly than\nfemale cones but are present on the tree for\na much shorter time. Typically, they are\nproduced in the fall and are visible as a clus-\nter of structures at the base of bud. These\nexpand in the spring/early summer (Fig. 2)\nand dry up and wither a month later. In\ncontrast to the female cones, m ale cones\nare simple in structure: a branch with\ntightly packed spore bearing leaves (sporo-\nphylls) , each with a pair of relatively large\nsporangia on their lower surface.\nThe gamet ophyte generation develops\nfrom microspores and megaspores that are\nFFiigg.. 22 MMaallee ppiinnee ccoonneess aarree pprroodduucceedd iinn\nproduced and retained in the male and\ncclluusstteerrss aanndd aarree llooccaatteedd bbeellooww tthhee ccuurrrreenntt\nfemale cones.

At\nfirst, the spores are in clusters of four, reflecting their origin in the two divisions of meio-\nsis (one cell to two cells to four cells). The spores eventually separate and undergo a very\nlimited period of development, producing a haploid organism with four nuclei, usually in\nthree cells (i.e., one cell has two nuclei), and possessing two wing-like air sacks (Fig. 3).\nParticularly significant to the development of the pollen grain (aka male gametophyte), is\nthe fact that its development is arrested. This, and the fact that the microsporangium\nbreaks open, allows the pollen to be dispersed by the wind.

At the time of\npollen release, female cones are very small\nand are \u2018open\u2019 with spaces above each\nindividual cone scale that are open to the\noutside (Fig. 4). Each female cone scale\nbears on its upper surface two ovules, each\nwith a megasporangium imbedded in\nsporophyte tissue called integuments.\nEarly in ovule development there is an\nopening, the micropylar canal, between\nFFiigg.. 44 AA ppiinnee oovvuullee aatt tthhee ttiimmee ooff ppoolllliinnaattiioonn\nthe integuments that connects to a space\nccoonnttaaiinnss aa mmeeggaassppoorree mmootthheerr cceellll..\nbetween the cone scales. Pollen grains\n(male gametophytes) in the air can slide between the female cone scales and be deposited\nin the space next to the micropylar canal. The ovule secretes a liquid \u2018pollination drop\u2019\ninto this space and pollen grains end up in the liquid and rehydrate. In a mechanism not\ncompletely understood, the liquid with the pollen grains is withdrawn through the 268 | CHAPTER 15: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS\nmicropylar canal to a space on the inside of the integuments adjacent to the megaspo-\nrangium.\nSoon thereafter the integuments grow to\nblock the micropylar canal and the cone\nscales grow to seal the female cone off\nfrom the outside. At this time the megas-\nporangium has a single megaspore mother\ncell destined to undergo meiosis. After\nmeiosis, only one of the four daughter\ncells remains as a megaspore. The megas-\npore is not dispersed but develops within\nthe megasporangium into a female game-\nFFiigg.. 55 DDeeppiiccttiioonn ooff aa ppiinnee oovvuullee aafftteerr\ntophyte of several thousand cells that gen- ppoolllliinnaattiioonn,, ttyyppiiccaallllyy iinn tthhee ssuummmmeerr aafftteerr tthhee\nffeemmaallee ccoonneess aappppeeaarr..\nerally produces two or three archegonia,\neach of which produces a single egg. All of\nthis occurs inside the female cone that is attached and is part of the sporophyte plant. The\nfemale gametophytes of conifers are highly reduced \u2018organisms\u2019 found within the ovulate\ncones, imbedded inside sporophyte tissue of the plant.\nAt the time of pollination there usually is no female gametophyte, only a megaspore.\nInside the cone, the male gametophyte s continue their development, albeit very slowly in\npines, requiring 12 months between pollination and fertilization. CHAPTER 15: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS | 269\nAs the megaspore produces a spore that\nslowly develops into a female gameto-\nphyte, it goes through a \u2018free nuclear\u2019 stage\nwhere mitotic divisions are not accompa-\nnied by cell wall formation (the organism\nis coenocytic). Eventually cell walls form\nand the female gametophyte forms struc-\ntures described as archegonia, each with a\nsingle egg.\nAs the female gametophyte develops, the\npollen germinates and a single cell elon-\ngates from the grain, growing through the\nFFiigg.. 66 DDeeppiiccttiioonn ooff aa ppiinnee oovvuullee jjuusstt bbeeffoorree megasporangium (the nucellus) towards\nffeerrttiilliizzaattiioonn,, ttyyppiiccaallllyy aa yyeeaarr aafftteerr ppoolllliinnaattiioonn..\nthe female gametophyte (Fig. 6)..

During the time between pollination and fertilization, the\nfemale cones grow only a small amount and they remain closed to the outside. Note that\nno swimming sperm is produced, the male gametophyte grows to the egg by means of an\nelongate cell.\nFollowing fertilization, the zygote develops into an embryo, imbedded in, and nourished\nby, the female gametophyte. Tissues surrounding the female gametophyte develop into a\nseed coat, often producing a wing structure that allows the seed to be dispersed by the\nwind. As the seed develops, the cone surrounding it also develops, often growing substan-\ntially. Following fertilization, seeds may mature in as short a time as one year but for most\nspecies it is two years or longer. In most pines, the cones eventually re-open, allowing\nthe seeds to fall out and be dispersed by the wind. Sometimes the cones remained closed\nand only open following the intense heat of a fire. The female cones of junipers and yews\ndevelop fruit-like features that attract animals who facilitate seed dispersal by consuming\nthe \u2018fruits\u2019 and defecating the seed in a new location. 270 | CHAPTER 15: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS\nOOtthheerr ggyymmnnoossppeerrmmss\nThe three other groups of seed plants without flowers, Gnetophytes, Cycads and Ginkgo\nexhibit the same basic pattern of seed production: male spores develop into pollen grains\nwhich are dispersed from the sporophyte to finish their development in the structure that\nproduces female spores and hence the female gametophytes. Pollination in at least some\ncycads and in some gnetophytes involves insects; in ginkgo and most gnetophytes pollina-\ntion is by the wind. Gymnosperm literally means \u2018naked seed\u2019 and one feature that unifies\nthe non-flowering seed plants is that, at the time of pollination, the ovules are accessible,\nnot buried in tissues that the male gametophyte must grow through; instead, the ovules\nare available, at least for a brief period of time, because the cone scales have not fused\nwith each other and the micropylar canal is open. However, the male gametophyte gen-\nerally DOES have to grow through the megasporangium (the nucellus) to reach the egg.\nIn cycads, the male gametophyte actually develops a type of feeding structure (called an\nhaustorium), a branched filamentous structure permeating the nucellus and apparently\nobtaining nourishment from it. Eventually a flagellated, mobile sperm is released and\nswims through the fluid of an \u2018archegonial chamber\u2019, an area of fluid between the nucellus\nand the female gametophyte. Flagellated sperm are also found in ginkgo.\nFFlloowweerriinngg ppllaannttss\nThe basic process of seed development in flowering plants is the same as in conifers. The\nmajor differences include the following:\n\u2022 Male (pollen producing) and female (seed producing) organs are usually found\ntogether in the same structure, the flower, not separated on two distinct branches\nas they are in conifers.\n\u2022 The ovules are produced inside a structure called an ovary, that is not open to the\noutside, thereby requir ing the male gametophyte grow through a substantial dis-\ntance of sporophyte tissue in order to contact the female gametophyte\n\u2022 The transfer of pollen (pollination) often involves biological agents (insects, birds,\nrarely mammals) and a variety of floral features enhance pollination.\n\u2022 The female gametophyte , which is called an embryo sac (Fig. 7). CHAPTER 15: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS | 271\nbecause it eventually contains the\nembryo, is even more reduced than in\nother seed plants, drastically so, usually\nconsisting of only seven cells, six hap-\nloid cells, one of which is the egg, and\none larger central cell with two haploid\nnuclei.\n\u2022 Both of the sperm nuclei produced by\nthe male\ngametophyte participate in a fertiliza-\ntion (syngamy) event.

The initial stages of\nendosperm development involve a \u2018free-nuclear\u2019 stage where nuclei divide with no\ncell wall formation, creating a multinucleate, all triploid, (coenocytic) cell. This\nmaterial is called \u2018liquid endosperm\u2019 and is familiar as coconut milk, which is actu-\nally cytosol.\n\u2022 In contrast with other seed plants, e.g., the conifers, in angiosperms the female\ngametophyte, which is very limited both in size and lifespan, is not the nutritive\ntissue for the developing embryo. In angiosperms the nutritive tissue for the devel-\noping embryo is the endosperm, the tissue resulting from a second fertilization\nevent. 272 | CHAPTER 15: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS\nThe flower\nThe flower is a highly modified stem, typ-\nically with four whorls that are bunched\nclose together at the end of the branch.\nThe components of each of the four\nwhorls is thought to represent modified\nleaves, with the inner two whorls being\nhighly modified spore bearing leaves\n(sporophylls) (Fig. 8-9). The elements of\noutermost whorl (sepals) are the most\nleaf-like, although often quite small. The\nelements of the next whorl (petals) are\noften leaf-like in form but usually are\nlarge and colorful structures that lack\nchlorophyll.

Carpels are the\ninnermost whorl and often are fused together so the central structure of the flower is a\nsingle (\u2018compound\u2019) pistil. Carpel(s) generally consist of an enlarged base (the ovary), with\na stalked structure (the style) emerging from its top that terminates with a surface (the\nstigma) that receives pollen. Inside the ovary are produced one too many ovules that even-\ntually become seeds. Prior to this, the ovules are sites of megaspore production, female\ngametophyte (= embryo sac) development, fertilization and finally the process of seed\ndevelopment. Following pollination, the two-or-three celled male gametophyte (pollen)\ngerminates on the stigma and grows through the style and then gains access to an ovule\nby growing through the micropylar canal, an opening between the integuments that sur-\nround each ovule. Pollen tube growth involves the expansion of a single cell, called the CHAPTER 15: SEX AND REPRODUCTION IN SEED PLANTS | 273\npollen tube, that delivers two male gametes to the embryo sac with the egg cell. The tube\ncell fuses to the embryo sac and delivers two sperm to bring about double fertilization,\nallowing for the subsequent development of the zygote and endosperm.\nFFiigg.. 99 LLaabbeelllleedd iimmaaggee ooff RRaannuunnccuulluuss ggllaabbeerrrriimmuuss\nFloral modifications\nThe variations in the basic plan of flowers are one of the amazing stories of botany and\nof all biology.

The transformation of the ovary\ninto a fruit generally involves the production of new cells, the growth of these cells and\nthe development of features specific to plant being observed. The fruit generally has fea-\ntures that enhance the dispersal of seeds and often has features that protect the seed.\nAlthough it is generally easy to distinguish the seed from the fruit, occasionally there is\nno obvious demarkation between them or there may be a demarkation that is deceiving.\nFor example, almonds are derived from a fruit that is like a cherry (in fact cherries and\nalmonds are very closely related). We eat the fleshy part of cherries, which is part of the\nfruit.

Even for the simplest of unicellular organisms, repro-\nduction requires a shift in the \u2018normal\u2019 activities. The \u2018cell cycle\u2019 (Fig. 1) describes the pat-\ntern of activities that the cells go through in order to reproduce (i.e., undergo mitosis).\nAs the cell goes through this cycle its activities change. Changes in gene expression result\nin changes from \u2018growth and synthesis\u2019 activities (G1, S, G2 stages) to mitosis activities.\nThe transformations are even more substantial if a unicellular organism\u2019s reproduction\ninvolves sex. At some point in the sexual cycle meiosis has to be induced, requiring cells to\ndrastically reorganize themselves in a manner that will halve the number of chromosomes\nin a very specific way. Additionally, cells with unique abilities, the ability to fuse with one\nanother, need to be produced.\nFor multicellular organisms the required changes to bring about reproduction or to bring\nabout the sexual process usually involve profound changes: new structures may appear\nand the and the behavior of the multicellular organism often shift s, sometimes in drastic\nways, ways that may even end the life of that particular organism. This chapter considers\nsome of the common patterns seen as organisms shift their physiology and structure in\norder to reproduce. 280 | CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY\nFFiigg.. 11 TThhee cceellll ccyyccllee:: tthhee oouutteerr rriinngg ddiivviiddeess cceelllluullaarr aaccttiivviittiieess iinnttoo ttwwoo pphhaasseess,,\niinntteerrpphhaassee aanndd mmiittoossiiss..

For exam-\nple, normal fungal growth produces hyphae that are able to explore the medium it is\ngrowing in and obtain materials needed for growth. To reproduce asexually, e.g., with 282 | CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY\nconidia, a fungal filament grows in a different direction (usually upwards) and produces\na series of small, easily detached cells that can be dispersed. Thus, the fungus has shifted\nsome of its activities from its normal growth mode to reproduct ive mode. Another exam-\nple would be dimorphic fronds in ferns (Fig. 2, see also sensitive fern) and horsetails; the\nplant makes one kind of leaf for reproduction and another type of leaf for photosyn-\nthesis\u2013consequently its ability to photosynthesize is reduced as its ability to reproduce\nincreases.\nFor some plants, sexual reproduction involves a dramatic reorganization comparable to\nthe slime mold. Remember that a flower is a transformed branch and that branches are\n\u2018new modules\u2019, significant not only for their growth but also because of its potential to\nproduce even more modules. The transition of that branch to a flower changes all this \u2014\nit converts an indeterminate structure, capable of growing and producing more modules,\ninto a determinate structure that produces a flower or flowers and then a fruit and then\ndies, eliminating that module, and removing its potential to produce any other modules.\nIf all the shoots of a plant transition to flowering at the same time, then the plant as a\nwhole becomes determinate and will die after fruiting. This is what happens in wheat\n(Fig. 3).\nFFiigg.. 33 MMaattuurriinngg ((aanndd ddyyiinngg)) wwhheeaatt ppllaannttss CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY | 283\nWe can identify two \u2018extremes\u2019 in the pattern of allocation of resources to reproduction,\none involves partitioning the organism in space and the other involves partitioning it\nin time. Some organisms, like cinnamon ferns, most algae and many fungi, simultane-\nously produce parts for reproduction and parts that conduct \u2018normal\u2019 activities. While the\ndegree of partitioning may vary with time, the organism grows and reproduces more or\nless continuously. At the other extreme are organisms that spend part of their life growing\nand and then transform into a different type of organism in order to reproduce. Exam-\nples include butterflies, mayflies, carrot (Queen Anne\u2019s lace) , burdock, beet and mullein,\nall of which produce a very short stem with multiple leaves and no branches in the first\nyear of life. In the second year the stem elongates, branches form and flowers and fruits\nare produced. Most of the material stored from the first year of growth is directed to the\ndeveloping seeds. In addition, the leaves are dismantled to provide additional resources.\nConsequently, the ability of the plant to photosynthesize disappears and the plant dies in\nthe process of flowering and fruiting. In the first year the plant focuses on growth (acqui-\nsition of materials) , in the second, on reproducing.\nCCoonnttrrooll ooff rreepprroodduuccttiioonn aanndd sseexx\nIn most organisms the ability to reproduce is controlled by cues from the environment\nthat are sensed and bring about changes in structure and allocation of resources. Although\nit is often assumed that reproduction (and hence population growth) is dictated by\nresources, there certainly are situations where resources are available but organisms do\nnot utilize these resources to reproduce. Instead of being tied to resources, many organism\ns\u2019 reproduction is tied to specific cues in the environment\u2013they respond to these cues by\nreproducing. Stated another way, although adequate resources are necessary for reproduc-\ntion, they are often not sufficient to bring about reproduction. Among other things this\nmakes predicting population growth more difficult. This topic will be considered more\nwhen discussing the behavior of populations. Here we will discuss the particular cues that\norganisms utilize to trigger the reproductive process, sexual or asexual, and then consider\nthe (primarily sexual) reproductive patterns found in flowering plants and some specific\ncues that control many plants\u2019 reproductive patterns. 284 | CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY\nCCuueess ttoo iinniittiiaattee rreepprroodduuccttiioonn aanndd//oorr sseexx\nGrowth/development\nFor many unicellular organisms reproducing by mitosis, reproduction simply involves the\nachievement of a particular stage in cellular development. This is generally somehow tied\nto growth, i.e., the accumulation of enough materials that the cell can be partitioned in\ntwo. Growth is connected to time (\u2018cells have to reach a certain age to reproduce\u2019) but\nonly as mediated by material acquisition. Bacteria that divide every 20 minutes are not\ntiming the intervals, there are processes taking place, some of them fundamentally tied to\nthe acquisition of materials, that take 20 minutes to occur. If you change the temperature\nor change the availability of materials, bacteria will take a longer time to divide. Also, as\nnoted above, organisms have the ability to change their rate of material acquisition, i.e.,\nthey control how fast they grow, and because of this, they can control their rate of repro-\nduction.\nTime\nAlthough all eukaryotes appear to be able to keep time, very few have reproduction or sex\ncued specifically by time (i.e., have a stopwatch that is initiated and then reproduces at\nthe end of a specific time). However, it is common, especially for plants that have been\nselected for cultivation, that an integration of time and temperature determines flower-\ning. Plants need to grow to a certain stage in order to reproduce and this requires time\nand favorable temperatures. Many seed packets for home gardeners state something like\n\u2018flowers in 60 days\u2019\u2014 this is assuming a \u2018normal\u2019 temperature regime; if temperatures are\ncold, it might take 70 days. This idea of integrating time and temperature is discussed\nmore in Chapter 26.\nNutrients\nAs discussed above, nutrition (i.e., the acquisition of resources required for growth)\nclearly can be a factor influencing growth and development, but sometimes nutrition\nplays a more specific role. Chlamydomonas sex is triggered by low nitrogen levels; fungal\nreproduction often requires a specific media formulation different from the medium that\nbrings about growth; slime molds can be induced to sporulate (a phase of sexual repro- CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY | 285\nduction) by specific nutrient regimes. The ability of some perennial plants to respond to\nflowering cues has been associated with carbon/nitrogen ratios in the plant that can be\naffected by both photosynthetic activity and nutrient availability.\nAdverse/favorable conditions\nSurprisingly, both good and bad conditions may trigger sex or reproduction, depending\non the species. A number of organisms change their activities when conditions become\nunfavorable (e.g., high or low temperatures, drought, high or low pH, toxic levels of cer-\ntain chemicals) and often the change involves reproduction and/or sex. For example, slime\nmold plasmodia (the multinucleate giant cells) are induced to form sporangia when the\nconditions are poor. A number of tree species are known to flower particularly well when\nthey are about to die. These behaviors might be considered adaptive since it produces\nstructures (seeds, spores) that are resistant to harsh conditions at a time when conditions\nare deteriorating. Such structures may also be beneficial because they also provide for dis-\npersal and movement to new, and possibly more favorable, conditions. At the same time,\na cessation or reduction in the production of propagules during adverse conditions can be\njustified because the resources are needed to keep the organism alive and not used on the\n\u2018frills\u2019 of reproduction and sex.\nCues that are useful in predicting upcoming conditions\nMany species live in environments that vary seasonally and that have certain portions of\nthe year that are much more favorable to activities related to reproduction/sex than other\nperiods. The most obvious activity related to reproduction/sex is material acquisition but\nother factors might include: availability of dispersal agents (e.g., wind or perhaps specific\npollinators or fruit eaters), lack of predators for offspring, etc. The most common cue that\npredicts upcoming conditions is photoperiod (the amount of light and darkness within a\nday). Photoperiodic control of flowering will be considered after describing the patterns\nof reproductive effort found in flowering plants.\nPPaatttteerrnnss ooff rreepprroodduuccttiioonn aanndd sseexx iinn flfloowweerriinngg ppllaannttss\nAngiosperms can be divided into two groups based on their flowering behavior: mono-\ncarpic plants, that flower a single time and die, and polycarpic plants, that flower multi- 286 | CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY\nFFiigg.. 44 SSeenneesscciinngg ssooyybbeeaannss..

Monocarpic plants will die after flowering because all of their meristems have\nbeen converted from indeterminate vegetative shoots into determinate flo wering shoots.\nAfter flowering, the flowers develop into fruits and the plant dies both because there are\nno more vegetative shoots to produce more leaves and because the leaves that were already\npresent have been \u2018scavenged\u2019 as a source of materials for the developing seeds and conse-\nquently have been destroyed. This was discussed above and is found in a number of crop\nspecies including corn, wheat, soybean (Fig. 3 and 4).\nMany monocarpic plants are annuals, living for only a year. Whatever it takes to get the\nplant to flower occurs within a year of the germination of the seed. If a specific cue is\ninvolved, then within a year the plant develops a sensitivity to the cue and can respond.\nNote that some of the annual plants in northern (and southern) latitudes, especially those\ngrown in gardens, may be annuals only because of the elimination of favorable conditions\nin the fall\u2014they simply are killed by frost and cold and would live longer if the conditions\nwere more favorable. Most of these plants are not native to this area; most of the annu- CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY | 287\nals that are native to this area kill themselves off in the flowering process. In temperate\nNorth American habitats, most monocarpic annuals germinate in the spring and flower\nduring the summer, but some, called winter annuals, germinate in the fall, overwinter and\nflower in the spring. Most of the wheat grown in the northern U.S. would be considered a\nwinter annual, although in central and southern parts of the country the wheat grown is\na regular annual and planted in the spring.\nMonocarpic plants may also be biennials, sometimes defined as plants that live for two\nyears but more accurately described as plants that live for two growing seasons. These\nplants are generally found in habitats that are seasonal, i.e., have part of the year favor-\nable for growth and part unfavorable for growth, usually because of low temperatures, but\noccasionally because of lack of moisture. Biennials behave the way they do because during\nthe first growing season they are not responsive to the cues that induce flowering, while in\nthe second season they are. An example would be beet s, a species that needs a cold winter\nin order to be able to respond to the cues (photoperiod, see below) that trigger flowerin\ng. It does not flower the first growing season even though it receives the photoperiodic\ncue to flower but does flower the second year after being exposed to cold. Biennials are\nmonocarpic and generally exhibit a substantial dimorphism between the first and second\nyear, often having a very short stem and no branches the first year and elongating and\nbranching stem the second year. As mentioned earlier, one might think of the form the\nfirst year being associated with acquiring resources and the form the second year being\nassociated with reproduction.\nAlthough uncommon, a few monocarpic plants are perennial, living for multiple years\nand then flowering once (Fig. 5). Examples include century plant (Agave), bamboo, and\nsome gentian species. The case of bamboo is particularly significant to panda bears\nbecause they feed almost exclusively on the vegetative (i.e., non-flowering) bamboo plants\nwhich can grow for up to 70 or more years while forming an extensive clone. When the\nplant flowers, acres of bamboo, the product of 70+ years of growth, produces seeds (which\npandas do not eat) and in the process the bamboo dies, leaving the panda with no source\nof food. 288 | CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY\nPolycarpic plants are perennial. They\npotentially live forever because only some\nmodules are turned into flowering shoots\non any particular year. Since all of the\nplant is exposed to the same set of cues,\nthe different behaviors of different meris-\ntems, some producing flowers and some\nnot, is the result of differing sensitivity to\ncues. A common pattern is that only\nstems that are one-year-old respond to the\nflowering cue (see coltsfoot). Thus, a plant\nwill have two groups of shoots, shoots of\nthe current year that do not respond, and\nshoots of the previous year that do\nrespond, and therefore produce flowers\nand fruits and die. Hence, in the spring of\nthe year, these plants are composed solely\nof the shoots that will become flowers.\nBut before they flower, they produce\nbranch shoots that will not become flow-\nFFiigg.. 55 AAggaavvee,, aa ppeerreennnniiaall,, mmoonnooccaarrppiicc ppllaanntt..\ners until the next year.

The vertical stems, called\ncanes, are biennial, the first year growing vegetatively, the second year producing flowers\nand fruits and dying. A raspberry patch is perennial but the stems you see only live for\ntwo years, each cane behaving like a biennial.\nFlowering plant cues for reproduction\nWhile a few plants, especially plants selected for cultivation, require no specific envi-\nronmental cue to induce flowering, they simply flower after the plant has grown suffi-\nciently, the majority of plants require specific environmental cues to trigger flowering.\nHowever, for many plants, the cue alone is not sufficient to trigger flowering; the plant\nitself must be able to respond to the cue, i.e., the plant initially is not responsive and does CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY | 289\nnot respond to particular cues. With time, the plant develops a sensitivity to the cue and\ncan respond when the cue occurs. Thus, when we consider what makes a plant flower, we\nmust consider the possibility that two processes are involved: one triggering responsive-\nness and a second triggering the flowering itself. A good example of this is the flowering\nof beet: in order to flower it must first be exposed to cool temperatures for a period of\ntime; this develops its ability to respond to a specific cue that induces flowering, which is\nphotoperiod, a particular combination of light and dark in a 24-hour period. Beet will not\nrespond to photoperiod unless it has first been exposed to cool temperatures. Hence, it\ngrows the first year without flowering, and only during the second summer, after a period\nof cool temperatures during the winter, will it be induced to flower.\nPPhhoottooppeerriiooddiissmm\nA wide variety of organisms, including plants, animals, fungi and protists, respond to the\nphotoperiod, relative amount of light and dark in a 24-hour period. For many organisms,\nincluding many plants, it is one of key determinants influencing reproduction (Fig. 6).\nSpecifically for flowering plants, photoperiod often determines when a plant flowers, and\nphotoperiod has probably been most extensively studied in this context. But it is impor-\ntant to appreciate that in addition to reproduction, photoperiod may affect a wide vari-\nety of organism features: physiology, structure, and behavior. Additionally, photoperiod\u2019s\nmechanism of action is at the molecular level, i.e., by influencing which genes are being\nexpressed.\nPhotoperiod is a significant cue for organisms living north or south of the equator because\nthe photoperiod predicts upcoming conditions. The approaching winter can be sensed by\nthe shortening photoperiods; an upcoming spring can be sensed by lengthening photope-\nriods.\nPlants have turned out to be excellent organisms to study photoperiodism because, for\nsome of them, a single day of a particular photoperiod can result in a measurable response.\nIn contrast, for some organisms, and indeed for most plants, a response is only apparent\nafter prolonged exposure to particular photoperiods.\nEarly studies established the fact that it is the night period that is critical. An interruption\nof the dark period can change a response while an interruption of the light period does\nnot alter behavior. The ability to respond to photoperiod requires two abilities: the abil- 290 | CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY\nity to sense light vs. dark, i.e., a photosensor, and the ability to keep time. In all organisms\nstudied, the timing mechanism appears to be associated with an internal 24-hour rhyth-\nmicity, something described as the circadian clock because the rhythms in behavior have a\nperiodicity of around (circa = around) 24 hours. A circadian rhythm is probably found in\nall eukaryotic organisms, certainly it seems to be a feature of most eukaryotic organisms\nwhere it has been looked for.\nFFiigg.. 66 CChhrryyssaanntthheemmuumm flfloowweerrss iinn tthhee ffaallll iinn rreessppoonnssee ttoo sshhoorrtt ddaayyss..\nThe actual photoperiodic response is the result of a particular pattern of light and dark\nthat is imposed on an organism\u2019s internal 24-hour rhythm. As a result, the behavior\nobserved after giving an organism 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark depends upon\nwhat portion of its 24-hour cycle that the 12 hours of dark is applied. The timing mech-\nanism is not a stopwatch that times the dark period, what is critical is how periods of\nlight/dark interact with internal rhythms that have a 24-hour periodicity. Stated differ-\nently, there is a periodicity in plants response to darkness. CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY | 291\nThe most commonly encountered photoperiodic responses involve reproduction but\nmore generally photoperiod can be an organizing factor determining the patterns of\ngrowth and development that an organism exhibits. Some of these are listed below:\nIn flowering plants:\n\u2022 flower production\n\u2022 temperature tolerance\n\u2022 production of vegetative buds\n\u2022 activation of buds\n\u2022 activation of lateral buds\n\u2022 formation of tubers (Fig. 7)\n\u2022 seed gemination\nIn non-flowering seed plants:\n\u2022 production of cones\n\u2022 formation and activation of buds\nFFiigg.. 77 PPoottaattooeess ffoorrmm wwhheenn tthhee ttiippss ooff\nIn dinoflagellates:\nsshhoorrtt uunnddeerrggrroouunndd sstteemmss eennllaarrggee aanndd\nssttoorree ccaarrbboohhyyddrraatteess..

Long-day plants (red line) need night lengths shorter than some critical\nvalue in order to flower. The actual critical daylength (i.e., the vertical part of the line)\nmay shift to the right or left depending upon the particular species (or variety within\na species). Note that neither of the two plants illustrated here would be flowering with\nnight lengths between 15 and 12 hours. Similarly, if the red line were shifted enough to the\nright, or the black line enough to the left, one would have situations where both long-day\nand short-day plants would flower at the same photoperiod.\nAlthough the names refer to periods of light in a 24-hour period, it is actually the night\nperiod that is critical. Hence long-day plants might better be called short-night plants CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY | 293\nand short-day plants might better be called long-night plants (but they aren\u2019t!!). Another\nconfusing factor to appreciate is that although we might consider that any day with more\nthan 12 hours of light is a \u2018long-day\u2019 (and \u2018short-night\u2019), what is critical is the actual length\ncompared to the critical value. Hence, one can have both long-day and short-day plants\nflowering under the same photoperiod: a photoperiod of 10 hours light and 14 hours dark\nwould trigger flowering in a long-day plant with a critical value of 9 hours of light and\nalso a short-day plant with a critical value of 11 hours of light.\nWhile plant responses fall into these three general types, the actual responses are often\ncomplicated by two factors. One is that a plant response to a particular treatment may\nnot necessarily \u2018all or nothing\u2019 (described as a \u2018qualitative response\u2019), meaning that the\nplant will not flower unless it receives the appropriate stimulus. For many plants the\nresponse to an appropriate stimulus is \u2018quantitative\u2019 meaning that the plant flowers more\nquickly or with more flowers if receiving a particular stimulus (the transition lines on the\ngraph above may not be vertical but instead have a slope). A second complicating factor\nis that photoperiodic sensitivity may involve multiple sequential signals, including ones\nthat do not involve photoperiod. For example, some plants will only respond to long-days\nafter short-days or respond to long-days only after a period of time under cool tempera-\nture conditions.\nIn plants there appears to be two pigments, phytochrome and cryptochrome, that can\ninteract with circadian rhythmic phenomena and produce photoperiodic responses.\nWhile both of these pigments interface with several different physiological processes,\nthe flowering response appears to be the result of changes in gene expression resulting\nfrom signal transduction systems that influence protein/DNA interactions. Specifically,\nthe appropriate photoperiodic stimulus appears to result in production of specific mRNA\nmolecules that are important in transforming vegetative shoot apical meristems into flo-\nral meristems.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 The cell cycle \u00a9 Zephyris is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Cinnamon fern \u00a9 Robbin Moran is licensed under a All Rights Reserved license\n\u2022 Wheat plants \u00a9 Dietmar Rabich is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Agave \u00a9 Muffinn is licensed under a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Chrysanthemum flowers \u00a9 Jebulon is licensed under a Public Domain license\n\u2022 Potatoes \u00a9 BASFPlantScience is licensed under a CC BY (Attribution) license 294 | CHAPTER 16: REPRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cThe Molecular Basis of Diversity in the Photoperiodic Flowering\nResponses of Arabidopsis and Rice\u201d by Ryosuke Hayama and George Cou-\npland.

Evolution describes\nchanges through time. What is it that changes?\nIt is not an individual organism, whose changes\nare described as \u2018development\u2019. What evolves\nare groups of organisms, i.e., populations (Fig.\n1). Populations are usually described as a group\nof organisms of the same species. T he criterion\nthat puts individuals together into a group\ncalled a species is the ability to interbreed, i.e.,\nFiigg.. 11 AA ppooppuullaattiioonn ooff ccoottttoonnggrraassss iinn\nspecies are groups of organisms united by the\ntthhee PPyyrreenneeeess mmoouunnttaaiinnss..\nfact that they can potentially interbreed, and\nthe only way to interbreed is through sex. Sex is the process that connects individuals\ntogether in to something called a species, a group of interbreeding organisms. Species, i.e.\ninterbreeding groups, are thought to be the biological entity that evolves. Additionally,\nsex is significant to the process of Darwinian evolution because:\n\u2022 sex can be an important process that generates variation within a population and\nvariation is significant to the evolution ary process, providing the \u2018raw material\u2019\nupon which the process of natural selection can act. 296 | CHAPTER 17: SEX, EVOLUTION, AND THE BIOLOGICAL SPECIES CONCEPT\n\u2022 sex provides a mechanism to spread particular features within a population, allow-\ning favorable characteristics to spread.\nIt should be pointed out that sex is certainly not required for the process of evolution.\nThere are a number of groups (e.g., bacteria) that evolve readily and have no sexual\nprocess (although bacteria DO have processes that allow characteristics to spread within\na population, it is not sex).\nMoreover, groups that do not have sex\ncannot be categorized as having species\n(although oftentimes they are!) because\nsex is what delineates an \u2018interbreeding\ngroup\u2019, which is the criterion usually used\nto define species. Thus, although sex and\nspecies are significant to evolution, they\nare not essential to evolution. As noted\nearlier, several of the groups considered\nhere (e.g., dinoflagellates) do not have sex,\nbut the groups\u2019 diversity clearly point to\nthe fact that evolution has been, and pre-\nsumably still is, operating.\nEven within groups that are considered to\nFFiigg.. 22 BBaacctteerriiaa aanndd aarrcchhaaeeaa hhaavvee nnoo sseexx,, yyeett\nbe sexual, e.g., flowering plants, there are\ntthheeyy hhaavvee ootthheerr mmeetthhooddss ttoo eexxcchhaannggee ggeenneettiicc\ngroups that do not participate in sex. mmaatteerriiaall aanndd tthheeyy cceerrttaaiinnllyy ddoo eevvoollvvee..\nDandelions produce seeds but do so in a\nmanner that does not involve sex. Such groups might be considered evolutionary \u2018dead-\nends,\u2019 yet, as noted above, sex is not essential to the process of evolution.\nThe process of sex is significant to the grouping and naming practices discussed in Chap-\nter 2. To deal with diversity, biologists group organisms that are phylogenetically con-\nnected (reflected in the fact that organisms within the group \u2018look alike\u2019). There are\ndifferent levels of relatedness that correspond to different \u2018levels\u2019 in a biological classifica-\ntion: phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, variety. Except for the species level (and\nperhaps not even there!), all of these levels are not defined, e.g., there is no rule about\nwhat constitutes a family, about how similar organisms have to be to put them together\nin family grouping. As a consequence, there certainly can be some workers who will take CHAPTER 17: SEX, EVOLUTION, AND THE BIOLOGICAL SPECIES CONCEPT | 297\na group, e.g., the pea family, and say that it should be considered as three families, making\nthree groups, each of which is more uniform than is the group when considered as a single\nfamily. The species level is unique in having a criterion that defines who should be in any\nparticular group.\nHowever, in spite of the fact that there IS a concrete definition of species, i.e., an inter-\nbreeding group, this does not mean that it is easily applied or that when it is applied the\nappellation is based on the definition. It is not that easy to discern who is breeding with\nwhom and this is especially the case with plants and fungi. Studies to determine mating\nbehavior are time consuming and the overwhelming majority of species (even in the ani-\nmal groups) have not been checked to see if what is being called a species actually is an\ninterbreeding group. And many, many groups that are known to be asexual (all prokary-\notes, most dinoflagellates, many fungi, some flowering plants) are grouped into entities\ncalled \u2018species.\u2019 Thus, at every taxonomic level workers still rely on subjectivity to delin-\neate the extent of taxonomic groups; and one finds both \u2018lumpers\u2019 (people who tend to\nlump groups together and have fewer groups with more variation in each) and \u2018splitters\u2019\n(people who tend to split groups up and have more groups with less variation in each).\nConsider again the example of asexual\ndandelions (Fig. 3). The entity Taraxacum\nofficinale is asexual, and is generally con-\nsidered to be a species represented by its\nLatin binomial. But should it really be\nconsidered a species? Some workers con-\nsider the T. officinale to be an assemblage\nof several hundred \u2018microspecies\u2019, each of\nwhich is a clonal population.\nFor sexual populations, who breeds with\nwhom is controlled by a number of para-\nmeters specific to the species being con-\nsidered. Collectively, these factors FFiigg.. 33 AA \u2018\u2018flfloowweerr\u2019\u2019 ((aaccttuuaallllyy aa cclluusstteerr ooff mmaannyy\nflfloowweerrss)) ooff ddaannddeelliioonn,, aann aasseexxuuaall \u2018\u2018ssppeecciieess\u2019\u2019..\ndescribe a \u2018breeding system\u2019 and it turns\nout that flowering plants offer a rich\ndiversity of breeding systems.

Growth requires the acquisition of matter and both the acquisition of\nmatter and the incorporation of this material into a living form (i.e., into biomolecules)\ninvolves energy. Both matter and energy are needed but it is important to keep in mind\nthat they are two distinct entities that are NOT interconvertible. The energy transfor-\nmations that organisms carry out involve manipulations of matter but they DO NOT\ninvolve converting matter into energy. Energy is obtained by rearranging matter, mostly\nby converting carbohydrates and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water. What compli-\ncates understanding is that matter is needed in two ways (Fig. 1): (1) materially, providing\nthe materials that become part of the organism, mostly carbohydrates or carbohydrate\nderivatives, (2) energetically, because energy can be made available as matter is rearranged,\ne.g., converting carbohydrates and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water. Although mat-\nter is being rearranged, it is not being transformed into energy.\nMMaatttteerr,, EEnneerrggyy aanndd tthhee LLaawwss ooff TThheerrmmooddyynnaammiiccss\nMatter and energy are key players in the process of life at all levels: cell, organism, and\necosystem. Both matter and energy are familiar ideas, yet misconceptions are common,\nespecially about energy and the interplay between matter and energy in biological sys-\ntems. Matter is straightforward: it has mass, occupies space and can be categorized into\nelements (e.g., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen) that often are usually present in specific mix-\ntures termed molecules (e.g., carbon dioxide, glucose) that have a characteristic composi-\ntion of elements and are arranged in specific ways. Living things are made of matter and\nhave a characteristic material composition, being made of biomolecules such as proteins,\ncarbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Life may be partly defined by the ability of living things\n(organisms) to acquire matter and incorporate it into themselves, i.e., to grow. Life can\nalso be defined on the basis of its ability to manipulate matter in characteristic ways that\ninvolve energy transfers. 302 | CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS\nFFiigg.. 11 TThhiiss iiss aann aammooeebbaa tthhaatt hhaass jjuusstt eenngguullffeedd aa ddiiaattoomm..

Energy has the ability to affect matter by rearranging it or moving it from one\nplace to another.\n2. Energy is dynamic and the energy associated with a given bit of matter, e.g., a mol-\necule, depends on circumstances; it is a function of the situation matter finds itself\nin, the speed it is moving, the location that it is in, in particular its position relative\nto other matter or relative to electric, magnetic and gravitational fields (which are CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS | 303\ncontrolled by matter).\n3. Energy is a property of systems, i.e., an assemblage of matter in a particular place\nand with specific relationships with each other.\n4. Energy describes the ability of a given assemblage of matter (a \u2018system\u2019) to change\nthe organization of another bit of matter (another \u2018system\u2019 or perhaps \u2018the sur-\nroundings\u2019).\n5. Energy could cause atoms or molecules to move in relationship to each other, e.g. a\nchemical reaction, or cause an object to change position in a gravitational field (rise\nor fall), or cause a charged molecule or object to change position in an electrical\nfield.\n6. Just as energy can cause movement of matter, the movement of matter (i.e., matter\nchanging position) changes the energy content and allows energy to be \u2018transferred\u2019\nfrom one system to another or one molecule to another.\n7. Energy can also be transferred to material via electromagnetic radiation, waves of\nelectricity and magnetism that are given off by any bit of matter with a tempera-\nture above absolute zero (i.e., every bit of matter!!!).\n8. Electromagnetic radiation is a \u2018form\u2019 of energy that is important to all forms of life\nbut especially so for photosynthetic organisms. Electromagnetic radiation has a\ndual nature and can be described as (1) a rhythm of electric and magnetic fields, a\nseries of waves with a certain frequency and wavelength, moving at a constant\nspeed, the speed of light, or (2) packets of energy called photons. The energy in a\npacket (a photon) is related to the wavelength of the waves of electricity and mag-\nnetism. Note that these photons/waves of electricity and magnetism are able to\ninteract with matter and transform it, thereby transferring energy to the matter.\n9. Two other concepts related to energy are heat, which can affect matter by changing\nits kinetic energy, changing the average speed that molecules are moving, and work,\nwhich can change the position of objects in a gravitational field, or perhaps concen-\ntrate chemicals in a particular spot (chemical work). While both heat and work are\nconnected to energy and are sometimes considered \u2018forms\u2019 of energy, they might\nbetter be described as interactions between systems or between a system and its\nsurroundings.\nA common feature of both matter and energy is that both are conserved, something\ndescribed in what is known as the first law of thermodynamics. Although modern physics\nhas demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy and it is their collective entity\n(matter + energy) that is conserved, in biological systems matter and energy are NEVER 304 | CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS\nconverted from one to the other and consequently we can consider each to be conserved\n\u2014 there is always the same amount of matter and the same amount of energy. Neither\none is created, destroyed or \u2018used up.\u2019 The conservation of matter is easily understood,\nmatter can be moved from one place to another, e.g. accumulated in an organism, lost (or\ngained) by diffusion from (or to) an organism. Elements can be rearranged, e.g. carbon\ntransformed from carbohydrate to carbon dioxide in the process of cellular respiration,\nbut the amount of matter is constant \u2014the same number of carbons, hydrogens and oxy-\ngens. Similarly (and much less appreciated) , energy is conserved. It can be \u2018moved\u2019 from\nplace to place, or transformed from one form to another (as molecules are rearranged or\nmoved relative to each other and relative to gravitation al, electrical and magnetic fields),\nbut the amount of energy is constant, unchanging. Living systems, non-living systems and\ncombinations of living and non-living systems rearrange matter, and by rearranging mat-\nter they redistribute energy. But the first law of thermodynamics states that in all these\nrearrangements there is a constraint: after any rearrangement, the amount of matter and\nthe amount of energy must be the same as it was in the beginning.\nLiving things constantly reorganize matter: molecules combine, molecules separate into\npieces, molecules move from one place to another. In all of these transformations, matter\nmust be conserved. In addition, the energy must be conserved; consequently, organisms\nmay release energy during some transformations (because the final arrangement of mate-\nrial in the organism has less energy than the initial arrangement); or, if the final arrange-\nment has more energy than the initial one, the organisms must somehow have acquired\nenergy to bring about the transformation.\nSince matter and energy play in zero-sum games then one might think that their transfor-\nmations are rather tedious and potentially circular, with losses in one spot being exactly\nmatched by gains somewhere else, and the potential of ending up exactly where you\nstarted. This is not the case, there is a direction to the transformations and it is strictly\na one-way flow: you can never return to the starting point. This constraint is dictated by\nthe second law of thermodynamics which states that in spite of the fact that energy is con-\nserved, the amount of energy that can be used to do work is always decreasing. To most,\nthis statement is startling because they assume that all energy can be used to do work; but\nsome energy is not \u2018useful\u2019 and the second law states that the amount of \u2018useless\u2019 energy\nis always increasing. The second law of thermodynamics is extremely powerful and this is\nreflected in the fact that it can be defined in a variety of ways. Fundamentally, its utility\nrests in the fact that it puts an arrow on rearrangements of matter. Given two possible CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS | 305\narrangements, A to B, each with the same amount of matter and energy, the second law\ndictates that the direction of the rearrangement will always be to a situation that has less\nuseful energy. The second law points out what rearrangements of matter will be \u2018sponta-\nneous\u2019, i.e., occur \u2018on their own.\u2019 Rearrangements in the opposite direction (the non-spon-\ntaneous direction) will only occur if energy, useful energy, is supplied.\nThe second law adds a second constraint on transformations; not only must matter and\nenergy be conserved but the amount of useful energy must decrease. Consider a system\nA with a certain amount of matter and energy at a particular time, and the same system,\nnow called A\u2019, a time later; the second law dictates that, barring interaction with the sur-\nroundings, the only change in A that is possible as it transitions to A\u2019 is one where there\nis a decrease in energy available to do work; thus once you leave situation A, you can\u2019t\nreturn to it (i.e., get from A\u2019 back to A). A lthough the energy in both is the same, the\namount of energy available to do work is diminished as it transitions from A to A.\u2019 This\nreflects one of the common ways that the second law can be stated: there are no perpet-\nual motion machines. A device can\u2019t get back to where it started without energy from the\n\u2018outside\u2019.\nOOrrggaanniissmmss,, mmaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nHow is all of this significant to organisms?? Organisms are defined in part by their ability\nto grow and since growth requires the acquisition of matter, all organisms need to be able\nto acquire the specific materials that they construct themselves with. Moreover, growth\nrequires useful energy because work is done in the construction of most new molecules for\ngrowth. What complicates understanding is that matter (\u2018food\u2019) plays a dual role: (1) mate-\nrially, providing the materials that become part of the larger organism, (2) energetically,\nproviding energy that is made available as matter is rearranged. The transformations of\nmatter and the transfers of energy performed by organisms are intertwined in ways that\nallow misconceptions to easily be acquired but it is important to remember that matter\nand energy are two different entities.\nBut growth isn\u2019t the only reason that organisms need matter and it isn\u2019t the only reason\nwhy organisms need energy. 306 | CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS\nWhy organisms need energy\n1. In addition to needing energy for growth, organisms need energy because they \u2018do\nwork\u2019 in a physical/chemical sense. They create electrochemical potentials, they\ndevelop pressure, they generate forces that result in movement. Particularly signifi-\ncant is that they perform chemical work as they grow: many biomolecules consist of\narrangements of matter that contain more useful energy than the materials these\nmolecules are constructed from, and therefore energy is needed to synthesize them.\nThe process of growth requires organisms to rearrange material, reposition it, in\nways that cause the new material to possess more useful energy than what it was\nmade from. This is only possible if organisms have a \u2018supply of energy\u2019 and the work\nthat they do is possible because part of the energy in this supply is \u2018used\u2019 to allow\nfor the rearrangements of materials. Note that energy is conserved, but the amount\nof useful energy, the amount that can be used to do work, is diminished.\n2. But even in the hypothetical situation where an organism is not growing (making\nmore biomolecules) and not doing work (e.g., moving itself or materials within it\nself), it would still need energy simply to maintain itself. Organisms exist in an\norganized state that spontaneously degrades to a less organized state. The mainte-\nnance of the organized state requires energy. An easily understood example of this\ninvolves the charge difference found across the cell membrane, with the inside\nbeing negative relative to the outside. This organized situation spontaneously\n\u2018breaks down\u2019 to a less organized one because electrical forces push negative ions\nout across the membrane and positive ions in. Maintenance of the organized state\nrequires energy because the process of organizing (in this case moving ions across a\nmembrane so they are more concentrated in one place than another) requires\nenergy.\nHow organisms obtain energy\nOrganisms\u2019 energetic needs are largely satisfied by acquiring biomolecules (food), gener-\nally carbohydrates, and processing them in a group of reactions called cellular respiration.\nCellular respiration (Chapter 19) is a controlled \u2018burning\u2019 process whereby carbohydrates\nreact with oxygen (the carbohydrates are oxidized), producing carbon dioxide and water.\nIf one compares the energy content of equivalent amounts of carbohydrate plus oxygen to\nthat in carbon dioxide plus water, there is substantially less energy in carbon dioxide plus CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS | 307\nwater. If you burn carbohydrates in a fire the difference in energy is released as heat and\nlight, but in cellular respiration, less energy is released as heat, and none as light, because\nsome energy is \u2018captured\u2019 in chemicals, in particular one called ATP. Because the products\nof the reaction (carbon dioxide and water) are invisible gases many believe that cellular\nrespiration converts matter to energy. But this is impossible, the first law forbids it! The\noriginal carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are still present, just now in different places rela-\ntive to each other. Similarly, the original energy remains but is now present in the ATP\nthat is formed and the heat energy that is released.\nWhy organisms lose material because of their energetic\nneeds\nAs an organism carries out cellular respiration it produces two materials (water and car-\nbon dioxide) that are easily lost and sometimes \u2018purposely\u2019 eliminated (e.g., in humans,\nwhere breathing, i.e., ventilation, facilitates the loss of water and carbon dioxide). As a\nconsequence of cellular respiration, organisms are continually los ing matter as carbon\ndioxide and water and consequently are also los ing weight. Thus, in order to maintain its\nweight, a respiring organism must acquire more \u2018food\u2019.\nObtaining matter and energy\nIn order to satisfy their energetic needs, an organism requires a supply of carbohydrates\n(or other biomolecules) to utilize in cellular respiration. These carbohydrates may be\nobtained in two basic ways: (1) by consuming biomolecules that have been produced by\nother living things\u2014carbohydrates or molecules like proteins that can be metabolized\nto produce carbohydrates or (2) by consuming \u2018self-constructed\u2019 carbohydrates that are\nproduced in reactions (usually photosynthetic reactions) that synthesize carbohydrates\nfrom carbon dioxide and water. Such reactions utilize \u2018sources\u2019 of energy (e.g., sunlight)\nthat allow a chemical reaction to occur where the products have more energy than the\nreactants. The synthesized carbohydrates are then used to power cellular respiration, i.e.,\nthey are converted back to carbon dioxide and water. The group of organisms that con-\nsumes carbohydrates that other organisms have produced are termed heterotrophs (het-\nero-other, troph-eat; literally \u2018eat others\u2019), and the group of organisms that make their\nown carbohydrates to \u2018eat\u2019 are termed autotrophs (auto-self, troph-eat; literally \u2018self- 308 | CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS\neaters\u2019). It is important to realize cellular respiration occurs in both groups, they differ\nonly in how they acquire carbohydrates to be oxidized in cellular respiration.\nIt is critical to keep in mind that matter and energy are two different things but they are\nintertwined. Energy that is present in carbohydrates and oxygen can be \u2018released\u2019 when\nthe material is rearranged in to carbon dioxide and water. The \u2018released energy\u2019 might end\nup as heat, or as work, or in a new arrangement of molecules (e.g. ATP is a rearranged ver-\nsion of ADP plus inorganic phosphate). However, the second law requires that the total\namount of energy in the new arrangement (e.g., carbon dioxide, water and ATP) must\npossess less ability to do work than the earlier arrangement (in this example, carbohydrate\nplus oxygen plus ADP plus inorganic phosphate).\nAppreciate that the \u2018food\u2019 that organisms obtain, either by finding it (heterotrophs) or\nmaking it (autotrophs) serves a dual function, providing (1) energy (through cellular respi-\nration) and (2) material (through a variety of metabolic pathways where carbohydrates are\nreconfigured to produce other biomolecules (proteins, fats, nucleic acids). If food provides\nenergy through the process of cellular respiration it is transformed into carbon dioxide\nand water and these cannot be used materially to make biomolecules. Alternatively, food\ncan provide \u2018building materials\u2019 that are used to make more cell membranes, cell walls,\ncellular enzymes, but this food will NOT be \u2018providing energy\u2019. Food cannot provide both\nenergy and building materials at the same time! You cannot \u2018have\u2019 your cake (build with\nit) and \u2018eat\u2019 (use it for cellular respiration) it too.\nThe major topics to be covered in the next six chapters on the growth of organisms are\noutlined below. As described above, almost all energetic needs of almost all organisms\nare a consequence of cellular respiration (Chapter 19)\u2014the oxidation of carbohydrates\nby oxygen, producing carbon dioxide and water. Satisfying the material needs of het-\nerotrophic organisms is a relatively simple story; however it is more complicated for\nautotrophs, where it involves both photosynthesis (Chapter 20) and mineral nutrition\n(Chapter 22), the acquisition of mineral elements like nitrogen and phosphorus. Although\nmost prokaryotes satisfy their material and energetic needs in typical heterotroph or\nautotroph fashion, we will also consider some of the metabolic diversity (Chapter 21)\nfound in some prokaryotes that reveal very different patterns of satisfying energy and\nmaterial requirements. This diversity is an interesting contrast to the familiar, normal\nways of life and also plays a significant role in the nutrition of plants by influencing\nthe availability of certain plant nutrients. We will briefly consider how organisms move\nmaterials throughout their bodies (Chapter 24), a process that usually (but not always!) CHAPTER 18: MATTER, ENERGY AND ORGANISMS | 309\n\u2018requires energy\u2019. We will also consider the nature of soils (Chapter 23), which serve as\nreservoirs for the nutrients and water that plants require. A final aspect of growth that\nwe will consider is the rhythms of growth (Chapter 25) that organisms, especially plants,\nexhibit and how this growth might be modeled.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Amoeba \u00a9 djpmapfer is licensed under a CC BY-NC (Attribution NonCommercial) license CHAPTER 19: CELLULAR\nRESPIRATION\nAlthough most bakers don\u2019t realize it, they work\nwith explosive material. Flour is highly flamma-\nble and under appropriate conditions flour dust\ncan explode. On several occasions flour mills\nhave exploded, perhaps the most famous being\nnear Minneapolis in 1878 when a recently built\nmill, one that at the time was the largest in the\nworld, was totally destroyed and 18 workers\nkilled (Fig. 1). More recently, in 2008, a sugar\nmill in Georgia exploded, killing 14 and injuring\n40 more.

Cane sugar, what\n6 12 6\nexploded in the Georgia mill, is made up of two such \u2018hexose\u2019 (six-carbon) sugars, glucose\nand fructose, bound together. Starch, the main component of flour, is made up of long\nchains of glucose molecules bound together. Glucose, fructose and starch are all carbohy-\ndrates and like all molecules they \u2018contain\u2019 energy. If carbohydrates react with oxygen to\nform carbon dioxide and water, energy is released.\nThe energy of carbohydrates and its release when interacting with oxygen is central to\nthe biology of most organisms. And understanding how the energy is obtained and uti-\nlized is significant not only because the energy released is essential for the functioning of\norganisms but also because it represents a unifying feature of all living things, every liv-\ning organism carries out this process, or part of this process, or something similar to this\nprocess.

Exactly how ATP participates in metab-\nolism varies and its action is often not direct and obvious in the way that the energy of\nfalling water allows a mill to \u2018do work.\u2019 The action of ATP often involves \u2018coupling\u2019 differ-\nent chemical reactions (examples below) with the consequence being that the participa-\ntion of ATP makes unlikely events more likely to happen and/or events that occur slowly\nmore likely to proceed rapidly.

The chemical process of burning is an oxidation, or more properly a reduction/oxida-\ntion, a type of chemical reaction where an electron is transferred from one molecule to\nanother. The molecule that loses electrons is said to be \u2018oxidized\u2019; the one that receives\nelectrons is \u2018reduced\u2019. The process is generally \u2018driven\u2019 by the fact that some molecules/\natoms have a higher affinity for electrons than others. In a thermodynamic sense, this is\nsimilar to the fact that rocks move downhill in response to gravity; one might say that\n\u2018low spots\u2019 (in a gravitational field) have a higher affinity for rocks than \u2018high spots\u2019. It\ntakes energy to move rocks up in a gravitational field and (most of) the energy expended\nmoving a rock up \u2018ends up\u2019 in the rock now in its new, higher position. If the rock then\nrolls down it \u2018gives up\u2019 energy and, after descending, the rock ends up with less energy\nthan at the bottom than it had before. The first law of thermodynamics tells us that the\nenergy is somewhere, where is it? One can state that the energy has been \u2018released\u2019 as rocks\nmove downhill and also that this energy can be \u2018captured\u2019 in various ways, i.e., work can\nbe done in the process (can you think of a way to capture the energy of a falling rock?). In\na similar manner, electrons move \u2018downhill\u2019, from molecules that have less affinity for\nthem to molecules that have a greater affinity for them, and as they move \u2018downhill\u2019 work\ncan be done. Keeping track of electrons and the affinity of different compounds for elec- 314 | CHAPTER 19: CELLULAR RESPIRATION\ntrons is sometimes challenging and we won\u2019t pursue it in detail here, except to say that\nthe task is made easier when what is transferred is an electron plus a proton, i.e., a hydro-\ngen atom and in these cases the oxidation/reduction is easy to trace by seeing what loses\nhydrogens and what gains hydrogens.\nThe summary equations for cellular respiration, in words and formula, are:\n\u2022 carbohydrate plus oxygen forms carbon dioxide plus water\n\u2022 specifically, glucose plus oxygen forms carbon dioxide plus water\n\u2022 C H O + 6 O \u2014\u2014 > 6 CO + 6 H O\n6 12 6 2 2 2\nIn cellular respiration what is oxidized are the carbons in a carbohydrate molecule of the\ngeneral formula C H O and what is reduced is O . The carbons of the carbohydrate\nn 2n n 2\nhave lost hydrogens while forming carbon dioxide (CO ). The oxygen has gained hydro-\n2\ngens while forming water (H O). It is important to realize that the carbohydrate does\n2\nNOT react with oxygen (although it does if a log is burned in a fire) ; the equation merely\nsummarizes a group of reactions occurring simultaneously and have the net effect of con-\nverting carbohydrates and oxygen to carbon dioxide and water.\nWe can split these reactions into four basic parts:\n1. Glycolysis\nA process that converts a glucose (six carbon sugar with six carbons, 12 hydrogens\nand six oxygens) into two pyruvic acid molecules, each with three carbon molecules\nand with the formula C H O (Fig. 6). Note that the carbons of the carbohydrate\n3 4 3\nhave been oxidized (lost hydrogens) as pyruvic acid has been formed. What has been\nreduced is a metabolite called NAD+ which has been reduced to NADH. Because the\nNAD+ has a higher affinity for hydrogens than the carbon in a carbohydrate, this\ngroup of reactions is \u2018downhill\u2019. Also occurring in glycolysis is the synthesis of some\nATP from ADP and phosphate ion (iP). Thus, some energy present in the hexose is\nnow present in the forms of NADH and ATP (and some has been released heat and\nsome is present in the pyruvic acid molecules).

Pyruvic acid decarboxylation\nEach of the two pyruvic acid molecules is \u2018oxidatively decarboxylated\u2019, removing a\ncarbon as a carbon dioxide and producing a two carbon (\u2018acetyl\u2019) fragment attached\nto the metabolite coenzyme A. The lost carbon has been oxidized as NAD+ is\nreduced to NADH. Because NAD+ has a higher affinity for electrons than the carbon\nin the pyruvic acid this reaction is \u2018downhill\u2019. 316 | CHAPTER 19: CELLULAR RESPIRATION\n3. Krebs cycle\nThe remaining two carbons derived from each pyruvic acid are added to a four-\ncarbon compound making a six carbon compound that is then oxidatively decar-\nboxylated twice and then goes through a series of oxidative steps to regenerate the\noriginal four carbon compound that can receive another two-carbon unit. This is\nwhat is known as both the Kreb\u2019s cycle or the citric acid cycle.\nThe net effect of steps 1-3 is the total oxidation of the carbohydrate to carbon diox-\nide, accompanied by the reduction of a number of NAD+ molecules to NADH and\nalso the reduction of a similar molecule, FAD, to FADH . Some ATP has been syn-\n2\nthesized in both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, but the majority of the ATP gen-\nerated in cellular respiration comes from step 4 below where the \u2018reducing power\u2019\nof NADH and FADH is utilized to \u2018power\u2019 an elaborate mechanism that \u2018utilizes\u2019\n2\nenergy from the reduced molecules to accumulate protons and create a charge and\nconcentration gradient across a membrane. This gradient is then used to synthesize\nATP.\n4. Oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport chain)\nLike the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in a mitochondrion, an\norganelle with two membranes with two aqueous spaces: in between the two mem-\nbranes and inside the inner membrane (Fig. 7). Oxidative phosphorylation trans-\nfers electrons, donated by NADH and FADH , through a series of membrane bound\n2\ncarrier molecules located in the inner membrane, ultimately delivering them to\noxygen. Oxygen simultaneously picks up protons and form s a water molecule, H O.\n2\nOxygen is essential to the process because it is oxygen\u2019s affinity for electrons that\ndrives the electron movement. To again use a gravitational analogy, oxygen is a \u2018low\npoint\u2019 to which electrons move. If there isn\u2019t a low point there would be no move-\nment. The movement of electrons through a membrane operates an \u2018electrogenic\npump\u2019: it causes protons (H+) to accumulate in the space between the two mem-\nbranes, creating an electrochemical gradient, a charge and concentration difference,\nacross the membrane. In an energetic sense, the pumping is \u2018uphill\u2019 and it is made\npossible by a coupling to the \u2018downhill\u2019 movement of electrons to molecules with\nhigher affinity for them. The proton gradient thus created is a source of energy that\ncan be utilized to synthesize ATP from ADP and iP. In oxidative phosphorylation CHAPTER 19: CELLULAR RESPIRATION | 317\nthere are two things moving \u2018downhill\u2019 in an energetic sense: (1) electrons move from\nNADH \u2018downhill\u2019 to oxygen because it has a higher affinity for them, (2) protons\nthat have been \u2018pumped\u2019 uphill then move \u2018downhill\u2019 across a membrane, from a\nplace where they are in high concentration to a place where they are in low con-\ncentration. If one \u2018follows\u2019 the energy it goes from glucose to the reducing power\nof NADH/FADH , to a proton electrochemical gradient, to ATP. Besides producing\n2\nATP, another very important consequence of the process of oxidative phosphoryla-\ntion is the regeneration NAD+ and FAD, compounds that are needed in glycolysis\nand the citric acid cycle. These processes cannot proceed unless NAD+ and FAD are\navailable (this point will be discussed further in Chapter 21 on metabolic diversity).\nFFiigg.. 77 OOxxiiddaattiivvee pphhoosspphhoorryyllaattiioonn ooccccuurrss iinn tthhee mmiittoocchhoonnddrriiaa wwhhiicchh hhaavvee ttwwoo mmeemmbbrraanneess,,\naann oouutteerr aanndd aann iinnnneerr..

Examining these reactions is not only\nimportant to the energy relations of a cell, but they also provide examples of \u2018coupling\u2019.\nATP is formed when a phosphate group (PO \u2013) is added to ADP, an \u2018uphill\u2019 reaction with\n3\nATP having more energy than ADP plus phosphate and under most circumstances, this\nreaction is very unlikely. Most of the ATP formed by eukaryotic living things occurs in\norganelles called mitochondria where the electron transport chain discussed above results\nin a high concentration of protons on the outside of a membrane (remember that mem-\nbranes are generally impermeable to charged items like protons). Embedded in the mem-\nbrane, with openings to both sides, is a large enzyme, a polymer of amino acids, that has\na very specific and complicated three-dimensional structure, a structure that is a conse-\nquence of the sequence of amino acids in the polymer. This enzyme binds ADP and phos-\nphate and also has a path, a channel, through which protons can flow through the protein\n(and also through the membrane) from high concentration to low. The movement of pro-\ntons through the protein causes the enzyme with attached ADP and phosphate to be bent\nin a way that makes it much more likely that phosphate binds to ADP, thereby forming\nATP. Note that the charge and concentration difference of protons across the membrane\nrepresents a \u2018source of energy\u2019 that can be used to do things, in this case, bend the mol-\necule and synthesize ATP. The energy from the proton gradient makes an unlikely reac-\ntion, ATP synthesis, much more likely. Stated another way, ATP synthesis is coupled to\nprotons moving from high concentration to low.\nA second way to synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate is seen in glycolysis. Instead\nof directly transferring a phosphate group to ADP it is first added to GAP (Figure 1).\nThis reaction by itself is unlikely (uphill) but it can be made more likely if the GAP is\nsimultaneously oxidized while NAD+ is being reduced, a reaction that is favored (down-\nhill) because NAD+ has a higher affinity for electrons than GAP. The combined reaction\nresults in the conversion of GAP to 1,3 bPG, with the GAP being simultaneously oxidized\nand phosphorylated. And while the attachment of a phosphate group directly to ADP is\n\u2018uphill\u2019 (unlikely), the transfer of a phosphate group from the 1,3 bPG to ADP is \u2018downhill\u2019\n(likely), thus there is coupling between oxidation of GAP and ATP synthesis. A similar\nmechanism operates where ATP is formed in the citric acid cycle. Coupling is an impor- CHAPTER 19: CELLULAR RESPIRATION | 319\ntant aspect of both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis and represents ways that energetically\nunfavorable (uphill) reactions can be made more likely by coupling them somehow (and\nthere are multiple ways) to favorable (downhill) reactions.\nSSuummmmaarryy\nThus the net effect of cellular respiration is the complete oxidation of carbohydrates to\nform carbon dioxide and water. In the process, ATP is synthesized from ADP and phos-\nphate. Although the process as described above \u2018starts\u2019 with glucose, a number of other\nmolecules can provide six carbon sugars to be utilized in glycolysis, e.g., starch (a polymer\nof glucose), sucrose (a disaccharide containing glucose and fructose), galactose (a six car-\nbon sugar), lactose (a disaccharide made of glucose plus galactose), mannitol (a six-carbon\nsugar alcohol). In plants, sucrose and starch are the most important sources of substrates\nfor glycolysis. Besides hexose/hexose polymers, other materials can be \u2018burned\u2019 in cellular\nrespiration, including fats and the carbohydrate portion of the amino acids of proteins.\nThese \u2018food sources\u2019 enter the metabolic pathways of cellular respiration in several differ-\nent places.\nAlthough cellular respiration is generally thought of as being a degradative process (catab-\nolism), it can also be synthetic (anabolism\u2014the making of biomolecules). When this\nhappens the material entering the cellular respiration exits the process before being com-\npletely oxidized, thereby providing metabolites that are used to construct biomolecules.\nFor example, intermediates of cellular respiration can be used to synthesize fats and\namino acids. When this happens less (or no) ATP energy is obtained because less of the\nprocess of cellular respiration is occurring.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\nIon the spring, skunk cabbage flowers generate heat by decoupling proton flow\nfrom ATP synthesis (as do some animals when they emerge from hibernation).\nEnergy that might have been \u201cused\u201d to make ATP is released as heat.

While a small portion of their (dry weight)\nmass comes from the soil, approximately 98% comes from the atmosphere. A typical serv-\ning of potatoes is 6 oz = 170 grams. Since potatoes are roughly 80% water a serving of\npotatoes is about 34 grams of dry weight. This weight is nearly pure starch which has a\nchemical formula (C H O ). Carbon atoms represent 40% of the weight of starch (or\n6 12 6\nof any hexose or hexose polymer) so that 34 grams of potato has 13.6 grams of carbon =\n1.13 mols of carbon. This has been derived from the air which is roughly 400 ppm carbon\ndioxide. In order to acquire the carbon needed for a serving of potatoes the plant has to\nextract carbon from approximately 67 thousand liters of air. This photosynthetic ability\nis even more remarkable because it involves a transfer of the energy of light (electromag-\nnetic radiation) into chemical energy present in the carbohydrate that is produced. The\nsynthesized hexoses have considerably more energy than the raw materials (carbon diox-\nide and water) used to produce them.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Overview\n\u2022 The light dependent reactions\n\u2022 The carbon dioxide assimilation reactions\n\u2022 Photosynthetic constraints: the photosynthesis/transpiration compromise\n\u2022 C4 photosynthesis\n\u2022 CAM photosynthesis\nOOvveerrvviieeww\nPhotosynthesis produces carbohydrates. The name reveals what they were originally con-\nsidered: hydrated carbons (i.e., water added to carbon), but research has revealed that a 322 | CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nmore accurate description of carbohydrates is reduced carbon dioxide. This is illustrated\nin the overall equation for photosynthesis:\nCO + H O \u2014> (CH O) + O\n2 2 2 n 2\nHydrogen is added to the carbon dioxide, i.e., it is reduced, and hydrogen is being\nremoved from oxygen, i.e., it is being oxidized. Note that, as in the case for cellular res-\npiration, the overall equation is a summary of the net effect of multiple reactions taking\nplace simultaneously. Specifically in photosynthesis, carbon dioxide does NOT react with\nwater. Instead, both water and carbon dioxide are consumed in a group of reactions that\nultimately produces oxygen and carbohydrates.\nThe overall reaction as written is exceptional because oxygen is a highly electronegative\natom, one that attracts hydrogens strongly, much more strongly than the carbon atom\nthat the hydrogens are transferred to. For this reason, the reaction is \u2018uphill\u2019 and unlikely\nto occur, while the reaction in the opposite direction is much more likely to occur, with\ncarbohydrates being oxidized by oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water (see the\nprevious chapter). The last chapter illustrated that cellular respiration (carbohydrate oxi-\ndation) is \u2018driven\u2019 by the electronegativity of oxygen; this electronegativity \u2018pulls\u2019 electrons\nthrough the inner mitochondrial membrane, ultimately uniting them with oxygen. Thus\na significant question concerning photosynthesis is what pulls electrons away from the\noxygen of a water molecule\u2014what has a stronger \u2018pull\u2019 for hydrogens than oxygen (i.e.,\nwhat is a more powerful oxidant than oxygen)? Light interacting with the pigment chloro-\nphyll plays a critical role in generating the strong oxidant. Also critical is the structure of\nthe chloroplast which, like mitochondria, consists of a complex structure of membranes\nseparating aqueous compartments. The membranes contain chlorophyll (Fig. 1) as well as\nother pigments and proteins, organized in very specific ways.\nTThhee lliigghhtt--ddeeppeennddeenntt rreeaaccttiioonnss ooff pphhoottoossyynntthheessiiss\nLight\u2019s role in photosynthesis is in rearranging specific chlorophyll molecules, causing\nthem to lose electrons (oxidizing them) and thereby making them oxidants that remove\nelectrons from other molecules and ultimately from water. Light is a form of energy and\nconsequently is able to change the circumstances of the material that it interacts with.\nIn particular, light changes the electron configuration of chlorophyll, shifting an electron\nfrom its normal position to a situation where it is more likely to escape from the chloro- CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 323\nFFiigg.. 11 AA ssppaaccee fifilllliinngg mmooddeell ooff cchhlloorroopphhyyllll:: wwhhiittee == hhyyddrrooggeenn,, bbllaacckk == ccaarrbboonn,, rreedd ==\nooxxyyggeenn,, bblluuee== nniittrrooggeenn,, ggrreeeenn == mmaaggnneessiiuumm..

The\nelectron lost from chlorophyll ultimately (after many steps) ends up associated with the\ncarbon of a carbon dioxide molecule, forming carbohydrates. The oxidized chlorophyll\nmolecule (i.e., the one missing an electron) is not a strong enough oxidant to extract elec-\ntrons from water. But it can act on the \u2018oxygen evolving complex\u2019, an enzyme complex\nthat contains four manganese atoms. A chlorophyll lacking an electron is capable of oxi-\ndizing one of the four manganese atoms. After this process is repeated three more times\nand all four of the manganese atoms are oxidized, the molecule is now a strong enough\noxidant to act on two water molecules, removing four electrons, one each from the four\nhydrogens, and these replace the electrons that had been lost from each of the four man-\nganese ions. This process produces four protons (H+) and one molecule of O .\n2\nThe electron lost from chlorophyll follows a path through a membrane similar to the\nflow of electrons through the inner mitochondrial membrane in the process of \u2018electron 324 | CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS\ntransport\u2019 (= oxidative phosphorylation) of cellular respiration, sometimes utilizing simi-\nlar electron carriers.\nAnd, similar to some of the steps in oxidative phosphorylation, some of the electron\ntransfers have the effect of moving protons from one side of the membrane to the other.\nMoreover, the \u2018splitting\u2019 of water, performed by the manganese-containing protein, adds\nprotons to that same side of the membrane. The accumulation of protons on one side of\nthe membrane creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. And, because of\nthe electrochemical gradient, ATP can be synthesized as it is in the electron transport\nchain of cellular respiration. But in this case the electrons are not flowing to oxygen. They\nmove first to a different chlorophyll atom, but only after it, like the chlorophyll mole-\ncule described earlier, has been oxidized by the action of light. When this second chloro-\nphyll receives an electron from the electron transport chain it is converted back to its\nnormal state, and in this state the chlorophyll can once again absorb light, be excited,\nand lose an electron, thus continuing the process. Note that we have identified two dis-\ntinct chlorophyll molecules, both of which absorb light and lose electrons. One chloro-\nphyll molecule (called chlorophyll 680) obtains \u2018replacement\u2019 electrons from a manganese\ncontaining protein; the second chlorophyll (called chlorophyll 700) obtains replacement\nelectrons from the electron transport chain. The flow of electrons described so far is:\nwater \u2014 >\nmanganese enzyme complex \u2014 >\nchlorophyll 680 \u2014 >\nelectron transport chain \u2014 >\nchlorophyll 700. CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 325\nBut they haven\u2019t finished their journey yet! Ulti-\nmately these electrons will be reducing carbon\ndioxide, but before getting to the carbon of a car-\nbon dioxide they are transferred to another\nimportant intermediate, NADP+ (Fig. 2) , a com-\npound very similar to the NAD+ that operates in\nthe mitochondria during cellular respiration. Like\nNAD+, NADP+ can accept two electrons and a\nproton to form NADPH and can lose the same\nelements to reform NADP+, i.e., it is an electron\ncarrier that (as NADP+) can oxidize compounds\nand (as NADPH) can reduce compounds. NADP+\nreceives electrons from carrier molecules that\nreceive them from an \u2018excited\u2019 chlorophyll 700\nmolecule. NADPH is a relatively stable molecule\nand is water-soluble, unlike many of the electron\ncarriers involved in photosynthesis that are solu-\nble only in the lipids of the chloroplast membrane.\nFFiigg.. 22 TThhee eelleeccttrroonn ccaarrrriieerr\nIn total, what we have described so far is a light- NNAADDPP++//NNAADDPPHH\ndriven flow of electrons from water to NADP+,\nforming NADPH along with O (Fig 3). The flow occurs in the inner chloroplast mem-\n2\nbrane and involves two steps where the energy of light is significant in making electron\ntransfer (i.e., redox reactions) more likely. The flow of electrons through a membrane is\ncapable of creating a proton gradient, as it does in the inner mitochondrial membrane.\nAnd, as is the case in mitochondria, this gradient in protons can be used to synthesize\nATP.

Since the supplies of these\nmetabolites are limited, it is critical that they be recycled. The reactions of carbon fixa-\ntion can be summarized in three steps: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration. CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 327\nCarboxylation\nCarboxylation describes the incorporation of carbon dioxide into an organic molecule.\nInterestingly, this can be accomplished without involving any of the products of the light\nreaction. Carboxylation occurs when carbon dioxide is added to a metabolite called ribu-\nlose bisphosphate (RuBP), a five-carbon sugar with two phosphates, in a reaction cat-\nalyzed by an enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco). The resultant\n6-carbon compound rapidly breaks down to two molecules of a three-carbon compound\ncalled phosphoglycerate (PGA).\nReduction\nAlthough carbon dioxide has been assimilated, the PGA is not a very useful compound\nbecause it is too oxidized. To be useful the PGA needs to be reduced. It can then be used\nas a precursor molecule to make a variety of biomolecules such as sugars, amino acids,\nnucleic acids and many others. In addition, the reduced compound can be used to make\nmore RUBP and thus allow more carbon dioxide to be assimilated.\nThe reduction of PGA is accomplished using NADPH and ATP produced in the light\nreactions of photosynthesis and produces a three-carbon sugar called glyceralde-\nhyde-3-phosphate (G3P).\nPGA + NADPH + ATP \u2014 > G3P + NADP+ + ADP + iP\nRegeneration of RuBP\nIn order to sustain photosynthesis the plant needs to regenerate RUBP, the 5-carbon sugar\nthat is used to acquire CO . This occurs when RUBP is synthesized from G3P. Obviously,\n2\nyou can\u2019t make a five-carbon sugar out of a three carbon sugar. You might do it using two\nG3P molecules but there would be one \u2018fixed\u2019 carbon leftover. However, the synthesis can\nbe accomplished tidily if one starts with five G3P molecules (fifteen total carbons) and\nmakes three RUBP\u2019s (also 15 carbons). These reactions are called the Calvin-Benson cycle\nand they require one ATP made in the light reactions for each RUBP produced.\nAt the same time, G3P can be used to make six-carbon sugars, in particular glucose and\nfructose and from them, sucrose, starch, cellulose and a wide variety of polysaccharides. 328 | CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nPutting both these activities together, if six molecules of carbon dioxide are fixed by car-\nboxylating six RUBP\u2019s, then 12 G3P can be produced after reduction utilizing 12 NADPH\nand 12 ATP. Ten molecules of G3P can be used to regenerate the six RUBP\u2019s and this\nprocess requires six more ATP. The remaining two molecules of G3P can be used to form\na fructose or a glucose. This is how all plants carry out photosynthesis. Each carbon diox-\nide assimilated requires two NADPH and three ATP.\nNote that ALL of the above equations are summaries of multiple reactions occurring\nsimultaneously. There is a great deal of chemistry taking place in chloroplasts, although\nthe net effect can be expressed simply as\n6 CO + 6 H O \u2014> (C H 0 ) + 6 O\n2 2 6 12 6 2\nNote that the net equation does not include ATP, ADP, iP, NADP+, NADPH, RuBP, PGA\nor G3P. All of these reagents are produced at the same rate that they are consumed. The\nnet equation also hides the fact that that actually 12 H O are needed as reactants and that\n2\n6 H O are products (the net effect is simply the consumption of 6 H O). Part of the ele-\n2 2\ngance of photosynthesis is that in spite of the myriad of reactions taking place, the net\neffect is very simple. Another aspect of its elegance is that the product of the process,\ncarbohydrate (CH O) , can be used to make all of the diverse chemicals that the plant\n2 n\nproduces, not just the obvious ones (starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins) but the less\nobvious ones (amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids, lignin, etc, etc). Moreover, carbohydrates\nare also used as a source of energy to power these synthetic reactions: In cellular respi-\nration. carbohydrate is consumed to produce carbon dioxide and water while producing\nATP and NADH, chemicals that are needed in many of the synthetic reactions.\nCCaarrbboonn ddiiooxxiiddee aaccqquuiissiittiioonn,, pprroobblleemmss aanndd ssoolluuttiioonnss\nFor terrestrial auatotrophs, the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis comes from the\natmosphere and it is highly significant that very little carbon dioxide is present there;\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is only 400 ppm \u2014 for every million air mol-\necules of air only 400 are molecules CO . Carbon dioxide enters the leaf by diffusion.\n2\nRecall the flux equation introduced in Chapter 3 that the flux of CO into the leaf\n2\nis dependent upon the driving force, the difference in CO concentration between the\n2\ninside of the organism and the outside. The outside concentration is set at a low value,\n400 ppm, and the inside value for most photosynthetic organisms (for most autotrophs, CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 329\ni.e. plants, this is the intercellular air inside the leaf) is about 100 ppm. This is because\nrubisco, the enzyme that catalyzes the \u2018fixation\u2019 of carbon dioxide, loses the ability to\nfunction when CO concentrations are lower than 100 ppm. Because the driving force\n2\nfor carbon dioxide diffusion into the leaf is low, the inward movement of carbon dioxide\n(i.e., photosynthesis) is limited. Again examining the flux equation, it can be seen that\nflux can be enhanced if the resistance to CO entry is low. In the case of a leaf this would\n2\nmean making the leaf more porous, more open to the outside air. In moist environments,\nwhere water is readily available, there is no problem with have very porous leaves (i.e.,\nopen stomates), but when water is scarce the plant must balance carbon gain with water\nloss. Stomatal behavior reflects this compromise: they generally close at night, when pho-\ntosynthesis is impossible, and during times of drought, when acquiring water to replace\nthat which has been lost is difficult.\nThe additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the last 200 years probably accounts\nfor the observation that the earth is \u2018greener\u2019 (increased leaf cover) now than 50 years ago.\nMore carbon dioxide can act as a \u2018fertilizer\u2019 and/or allows plants to survive under condi-\ntions of low water supply.\nWhile there are a number of features that allow some plants to survive under dry condi-\ntions there is one that directly involves the photosynthetic reactions discussed above. This\nmodified photosynthetic pathway, called the C4 pathway, allows some plants to acquire\ncarbon dioxide while losing less water than a normal plant would. C4 plants concentrate\ncarbon dioxide in a relatively small portion of the leaf, called the bundle sheath cells.\nThe pathway utilizes two carboxylations. The first occurs in leaf mesophyll cells and uti-\nlizes an enzyme, PEP carboxylase, that adds a carbon to a three carbon compound, phos-\nphoenolpyruvate (PEP). PEP carboxylase can operate at carbon dioxide levels down to\naround 10 ppm, roughly 1/10th of the concentration needed for rubisco to operate. The\nfour carbon compound produced by PEP carboxylase is transported via plasmodesmata to\na sheath of enlarged cells (Fig. 4) that surrounds vascular strands of the leaf. Here the four-\ncarbon compound is decarboxylated, releasing carbon dioxide that is subsequently fixed\nin normal photosynthesis using rubisco. The remaining three carbon fragment is trans-\nported back to the mesophyll cells. Using this system of two carboxylations allows plants\nto produce an environment (the bundle sheath cells) where there is a higher concentration\nof carbon dioxide. It is only in this location where rubisco is present. Because of the CO\n2\nconcentrating mechanism, the [CO ] can be greater than 100 ppm in the bundle sheath\n2\ncells while the [CO ] of the air inside the leaf approaches 10 ppm. Because of the lower\n2 330 | CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nconcentration of CO inside the leaves of these plants there can be a greater driving force\n2\nfor diffusion into the leaf. This allows the resistance to be higher (stomates more closed)\nwhile still achieving the same amount of carbon dioxide flux (photosynthesis) as a plant\nthat didn\u2019t utilize this pathway. Thus the leaf can function photosynthetically while being\nmuch less porous to carbon dioxide, thereby losing less water in transpiration than a \u2018nor-\nmal\u2019 plant.\nFFiigg.. 44 CC44 lleeaaff ((ccoorrnn)) sshhoowwiinngg eennllaarrggeedd bbuunnddllee sshheeaatthh cceellllss ssuurrrroouunnddiinngg tthhee vvaassccuullaarr\nbbuunnddlleess..

The C4 path-\nway is outlined below:\n\u2022 in the mesophyll cells of the leaf a three carbon compound, PEP, is carboxylated by\nPEP carboxylase, to form a four carbon compound\n\u2022 the four carbon compound is transported to the bundle sheath cells that surround\nthe vascular bundles (the veins of the leaf)\n\u2022 the four carbon compound is de-carboxylated, releasing CO and pyruvate, a three\n2\ncarbon compound CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS | 331\n\u2022 the pyruvate is transported back to mesophyll cells where it is converted by into\nPEP in a process that requires energy in the form of NADPH and ATP\n\u2022 the CO that was released in the bundle sheath is fixed utilizing rubisco in the nor-\n2\nmal pathway\nNote that C4 requires all the machinery and reactions of C3 photosynthesis, it is just that\nthere is an additional set of steps prior to the C3 pattern. C4 photosynthesis is less effi-\ncient than C3 photosynthesis because it requires more ATP energy. However, it is more\nefficient in terms of water use and this is of greater significance in drier regions. Also, for\nreasons that we won\u2019t go into, C4 photosynthesis is favored at higher temperatures.\nThere is a second group of plants that uti-\nlize the dual carboxylation pathway but in\na modified way. They are called CAM\nplants. CAM refers to crassulacean acid\nmetabolism because the pattern of behav-\nior shown by this group was first discov-\nered in succulent plants in the\nCrassulaceae family. CAM plants have\nseveral peculiarities: they are usually suc-\nculent, i.e., have thick fleshy leaves (Fig. 5),\nor no leaves and a thick, fleshy stem (e.g.\ncactus). They typically show a marked\ndaily pattern of tissue acidity with the\nhighest acidity at dawn and decreasing\nacidity during the daylight hours and\nincreasing acidity during the nighttime.\nFFiigg.. 55 JJaaddee ppllaanntt,, aann eexxaammppllee ooff aa ssuuccccuulleenntt\nppllaanntt wwiitthh tthhiicckk,, flfleesshhyy lleeaavveess..

The initial carboxylation occurs at night 332 | CHAPTER 20: PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nwhen stomates are open. The four carbon compound is an acid and causes tissue acidity to\nincrease. During the day the stomates close, carbon dioxide is provided by the decarboxy-\nlation of the four carbon acid and tissue acidity declines. The released carbon dioxide is\nre-fixed via rubisco to form carbohydrates.\nDo these plants photosynthesize at night or during the day? It depends on how one might\nwant to define photosynthesis: carbon acquisition is at night but sugar synthesis is dur-\ning the day. CAM photosynthesis is associated, but not obligately, with succulence. CAM\nplants are generally found in habitats that are dry, either climatically, e.g., deserts, or\nbecause of microhabitat, e.g., epiphytes, plants that are not rooted in the ground but that\ngrow on other plants. E piphytes are often exposed to drought because of their lack of\nconnection to the soil. Cactus and other leafless succulents are commonly CAM plants.\nCAM photosynthetic rates are very low and CAM plant growth rates are also low. The\nassociation of succulence and CAM probably reflects the fact that plants in arid habitats\noften develop succulence to store water and that succulence is more conducive to CAM\nbecause succulent tissues can store more carbon as the four-carbon acid.\nPatterns of both CAM and C4 photosynthesis reveal that these pathways have evolved\nmultiple times, i.e., the pathways say little about phylogeny. C4, C3 and CAM are mixed\nwithin genera, families and orders. Apparently, it is relatively \u2018easy\u2018 for C4 and CAM to\nevolve.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cEarly Evolution of Photosynthesis\u201d by Robert E. Blankenship.

Acquiring metabolic energy\nNearly all organisms utilize the reactions discussed in the chapter on cellular respiration\nto supply their energetic needs: cellular respiration provides energy in the form of ATP\nas long as a supply of carbohydrates and oxygen is available. Oxygen is readily available in\nall terrestrial habitats due to the fact that the atmosphere is 20% oxygen and local deple-\ntions are rare because the atmosphere is continually mixed by winds. In contrast, in some\naquatic situations (including soils saturated with water), oxygen may be in short sup-\nply. Present in such situations are a number of organisms, both prokaryotic (bacteria or\narchaea) and eukaryotic, that can obtain ATP energy in the absence of oxygen, in a man-\nner that utilizes only the glycolysis part of cellular respiration. Alternatively, there also\nare organisms, solely prokaryotes, that have mechanisms to make ATP that don\u2019t rely at\nall on the pathways of cellular respiration.\n2. Making your own food: energy flow in photosynthetic\nautotrophs\nIf you consider it closely, the energetics of photosynthetic organisms seems unnecessarily\ninvolved: the light reactions produce ATP and NADPH in order to synthesize carbo-\nhydrates from carbon dioxide. Then the carbohydrates are broken down in cellular res-\npiration to produce NADH (for our purposes the same as NADPH) and ATP. Why\nbother making carbohydrates?; why not just use the light reactions to obtain \u2018energy cur-\nrency,\u2019 ATP and NADH? To a limited extent, photosynthetic organisms DO satisfy some\nof their energetic needs directly off of the light reactions, i.e., not all of the ATP and\nNADPH produced is used to make carbohydrates, some power other processes. But for\nthe most part, the flow of energy in photosynthetic organisms goes from light to ATP and\nNADPH, to carbohydrates, and then back to ATP and NADH; and the amount of energy\navailable is diminished along the way because the energy transfers are not 100% efficient.\nThere are several justifications to this behavior of photosynthetic organisms:\n\u2022 cellular respiration evolved first and photosynthesis appeared as a means to allow\norganisms to avoid having to \u2018beg and steal for food\u2019\n\u2022 the need for energetic compounds is continuous but nighttime prevents photosyn- 336 | CHAPTER 21: METABOLIC DIVERSITY\nthesis from happening., ATP and NADH cannot be readily be stored and, while\nthey are constantly recycled, the absolute amounts of ADP/ATP and NADP/\nNADPH are small. In contrast, carbohydrates can stored and can be present in\nmuch greater amounts.\n\u2022 for vascular plants, the below-ground parts need energetic compounds yet can\u2019t\nphotosynthesize. The labile nature of ATP and NADH means that they cannot be\ntransported, while carbohydrates can.\nHowever, we will see that there are some organisms who use light in a strictly energetic\nrole, not using it to make carbohydrates that are subsequently be used to obtain energy.\n3. Material needs, specifically carbon\nAs to material needs, for the most part (or you might say \u2018for most of their parts\u2019 !), organ-\nisms are composed of carbohydrates, or molecules that are made from carbohydrates,\ne.g., the amino acids of proteins, which basically consist of a carbohydrate with nitro-\ngen group(s) and occasionally also a sulfur group attached; or fats, which are made from\ncarbohydrates that have had most of their oxygens removed. Thus any organism must\nobtain carbohydrates to construct more of themselves, i.e., to grow. For photosynthetic\nautotrophs, carbohydrate needs are supplied by photosynthesis, but note that whatever\ncarbohydrates directed towards material needs are not available to be used for energetic\nneeds. For heterotrophs, carbohydrate needs are satisfied by appropriating part of what\nis consumed to whatever \u2018building projects\u2019 a heterotroph may require, but, as a result,\nreducing the amount of energy that can be obtained. Nearly all organisms are either het-\nerotrophs, whose consumption of organic material (coming from the bodies or parts of\nbodies of organisms) provides them with both energy and with carbon materials; or pho-\ntosynthetic autotrophs who use light to make their own carbohydrates out of carbon diox-\nide and water and then, like heterotrophs, use this \u2018food\u2019 for both material and energetic\nneeds. However, there are some organisms (all prokaryotic) who are non-photosynthetic\nautotrophs, i.e., they are able to make carbohydrates without sunlight, using chemicals\nas an energy supply. There also are organisms, again prokaryotes, whose dietary habits\ninclude or require some materials that are not obviously \u2018organic\u2019, i.e., made by organisms,\ne.g., formaldehyde or \u2018plastic\u2019 (polyethylene terephthalate). There also are some organisms\nthat \u2018eat\u2019 solely for carbon nutrition and have other mechanisms, that are not based on\ncarbohydrate food, to obtain energy. CHAPTER 21: METABOLIC DIVERSITY | 337\nBelow are some groups of eccentric organisms, organisms that differ from the more usual\npatterns discussed above.\nEEcccceennttrriicc oorrggaanniissmmss II:: aannaaeerroobbiicc oorrggaanniissmmss \u2014\u2014uussee ooff\naalltteerrnnaattee eelleeccttrroonn aacccceeppttoorrss\nRemember that oxygen\u2019s role in cellular respiration is to be an \u2018electron magnet\u2019, a low\npoint to which electrons flow. Electrons obtained from carbohydrates are transferred to\nNAD+, forming NADH, and from it electrons flow through a series of carriers of the\nelectron transport chain. Oxygen\u2019s role is essential both because it \u2018drives\u2019 the electron\nflow that in turn allows ATP to be synthesized, and also because the process regenerates\nNAD+ which is required in order for both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to continue.\nIn most of the earth\u2019s habitats, oxygen is plentiful and has been ever since photosynthesis\nbecame popular roughly 2 billion years ago. But there are situations where oxygen\nbecomes scarce, generally as the result of cellular respiration coupled with physical fac-\ntors, e.g., waterlogged soils, that make oxygen replenishment unlikely (Chapter 26). One\nsolution to an oxygen deficit is to find another atom or molecule that will serve in the\nsame role, i.e., be a \u2018downhill location\u2019 to which electrons can flow.\nThere are a number of bacteria that do this, utilizing a number of different molecules as\nsubstitutes for oxygen. A particularly important group to plant nutrition are the denitri-\nfying bacteria. They use nitrate (NO \u2013) as the electron acceptor that receives the elec-\n3\ntrons from the NADH produced in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. In the process,\nthey convert nitrate, a form of nitrogen that most plants can assimilate (i.e., utilize) into\ndinitrogen gas (N ), a form of nitrogen that plants can not assimilate (although some can\n2\nwith the aid of a symbiont). Moreover, N is volatile and can escape the soil; in contrast,\n2\nnitrate is an ion and consequently unable to leave the soil solution, although the soil\nsolution itself may leave the soil, taking ions with it (i.e., leaching (discussed in Chapter\n23). The process of converting nitrate to dinitrogen gas is called denitrification and in\nsome situations, it causes a substantial loss of nitrogen from soils. Another substitute for\noxygen is sulfate (SO 2-), which, after accepting electrons, is converted to hydrogen sul-\n4\nfide. As was the case with denitrification, these reactions adversely affect plant mineral\nnutrition by eliminating a form that the plant can assimilate (sulfate) and putting sulfur\ninto a form that plants are less able to acquire and also a form that is volatile and can be\nlost from the plant\u2019s habitat. 338 | CHAPTER 21: METABOLIC DIVERSITY\nEEcccceennttrriicc oorrggaanniissmmss IIII:: aannaaeerroobbiicc oorrggaanniissmmss\n\u2014\u2014ffeerrmmeennttaattiioonn\nOne solution to a scarcity of oxygen, and one that is the closest to the normal patterns, is\na process called fermentation (\u2018anaerobic respiration\u2019) which involves an addendum to\nglycolysis, the first stage of cellular respiration, and necessarily the elimination of the\nremaining parts of cellular respiration. The pyruvate produced by glycolysis does not go\nthrough the citric acid cycle but instead is used directly or indirectly to accept electrons\nfrom NADH, allowing NAD+ (Fig. 1) , which is essential to glycolysis, to be regenerated.\nSignificant to the fermenting organism is that this allows glycolysis to proceed, although\nmuch less ATP is obtained in the process than would be formed if the citric acid cycle\nand oxidative phosphorylation were able to occur. Also significant is that, while the end\nproducts of cellular respiration are water and carbon dioxide, benign substances that are\neasily dispersed, the end products of fermentation, commonly ethanol or lactic acid, are\nmore toxic and more difficult to eliminate. Fermentation is extremely important in\nhuman affairs, both in the production of alcoholic beverages (generally by fungi but\noccasionally by bacteria) and in the production of desirable food products, e.g., sour-\ndough (Fig. 2), sauerkraut, sour cream, yogurt, all of which are influenced by lactic acid\nproduction. Some fermenting organisms are facultative anaerobes (i.e., they can live with\nor without oxygen). Most of these switch to fermentation if oxygen is not present but\nsome carry out fermentation regardless of oxygen availability. Some are obligate anaer-\nobes, meaning that they cannot live in the presence of oxygen.\nEEcccceennttrriicc oorrggaanniissmmss IIIIII:: mmaakkiinngg ffoooodd wwiitthhoouutt\nssuunnlliigghhtt--cchheemmoossyynntthheettiicc oorrggaanniissmmss\nMost autotrophs (\u2018self-eaters\u2019) make food through photosynthesis and then eat them-\nselves. The energy of light is what makes an unfavorable reaction, the reduction of car-\nbon dioxide by water, more likely. A vague but common description of the process is\nthat some of the energy of light is captured by the plant and stored as carbohydrates. A\nmore specific description is that light is able, in the organized structure of a membrane,\nto move electrons in a way that NADPH is formed from NADP+ using electrons derived\nfrom water. In the process, ATP is formed as a result of the electron flow. In the Calvin\ncycle, these products, NADPH and ATP, can cause carbon to be reduced with electrons CHAPTER 21: METABOLIC DIVERSITY | 339\nFFiigg.. 11 FFeerrmmeennttaattiioonn:: CCoonnvveerrttiinngg gglluuccoossee iinnttoo ttwwoo ppyyrruuvvaattee mmoolleeccuulleess rreeqquuiirreess ttwwoo NNAADD++\nmmoolleeccuulleess..

Light is essential to photo-\nsynthesis because it provides a mechanism to obtain NADPH and ATP. But these\nmetabolites can be made in other ways and there are non-photosynthetic autotrophs\nthat do exactly that. They are described as chemosynthetic organisms and they make\ntheir own food in ways that do not require light. What is needed is a chemical that can\ndonate electrons to reduce NADP+ to NADPH and a membrane system that allows ATP\nto be synthesized as the electrons flow from the donor to NADP+. Chemosynthetic\norganisms are uncommon and are only found within the bacteria and archaea, but they\ncan be very significant in certain habitats and in carrying out processes that are impor-\ntant to global biogeochemical cycles. Fr om a plant perspective, the most important\ngroup of these organisms are the nitrifying bacteria, a group that oxidize s ammonia\n(NH ) to nitrite (NO \u2013), and a group that oxidizes nitrite to nitrate (NO \u2013).

The electrons removed from the nitrogen compound are used to reduce\nNADP+ to NADPH and provide for an electron flow (through a membrane) that allows\nATP to be synthesized. These reagents are then used to reduce carbon dioxide in the\nreactions of the Calvin cycle, \u2018fixing\u2019 it in to a carbohydrate form. The nitrifying bacte-\nria, like photosynthetic plants, make their own food and then use it for synthetic reac-\ntions (as a building material) or as a source of energy (as it is oxidized to carbon dioxide\nin cellular respiration). There are other chemosynthetic organisms besides the nitrifying\nbacteria, including: (1) bacteria in deep-sea vents, that utilize hydrogen sulfide as an\nenergy source to fix carbon, (2) methanogens, that use energy from dihydrogen gas (H )\n2\nto fix carbon (and at the same time producing methane) , and (3) methane \u2018eaters\u2019 that CHAPTER 21: METABOLIC DIVERSITY | 341\noxidize methane to dinitrogen (N ) while reducing carbon. Many, but not all, chemosyn-\n2\nthetic organisms are archaebacteria, although most nitrifying bacteria are not.\nEEcccceennttrriicc oorrggaanniissmmss IIVV:: sseeppaarraattiinngg mmaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nFor most organisms, \u2018food\u2019, i.e., what heterotrophs absorb or ingest, and for photosyn-\nthesizers, the carbohydrates that they make, plays a dual role: as an energy source (pro-\nducing ATP and NADH) and as a carbon source, providing \u2018reduced carbons\u2019 that are\nused in a variety of biosynthetic reactions that ultimately can make the organism bigger.\nThe pathways for the two processes are initially the same but if the carbon is to be uti-\nlized as building material much less energy is obtained and less carbon dioxide is pro-\nduced. If used for energy, \u2018food\u2019 i.e., carbohydrates, ends up as carbon dioxide and the\namount of energy obtained is maximal; if used for material, the carbons of the carbohy-\ndrate end up in any one of the thousands of biomolecules found in the organism, in fats,\nproteins, nucleic acids, etc., and the amount of energy obtained is reduced compared to\nwhat would happen if all the carbons were totally oxidized to CO . However, there are\n2\nsome organisms who have distinct pathways for obtaining energy, pathways that gener-\nally don\u2019t involve carbon at all and their \u2019eating\u2019 is solely to obtain carbon atoms for\nbiosynthesis. The easiest group to understand is photoheterotrophs. They include both\narchae a and bacteria that are capable of using sunlight in a process that allows them to\nsynthesize ATP but not in a manner that produces carbohydrates. Thus they must \u2018eat\nfood\u2019 (absorb carbohydrates/organic molecules) NOT necessarily for their energetic\nneeds (i.e., to supply ATP) but rather to satisfy their carbon needs. This lifestyle is found\nin a few Archaea, for example, Halobacterium which possesses a pigment, bacteri-\norhodopsin, related to the rhodopsin found in vertebrate eyes. Bacteriorhodopsin is a\nmembrane-spanning protein that can acquire protons in the cytosol, change conforma-\ntion due to the absorption of light, and release protons on the outside of the membrane\n(Fig. 3). Protons then flow into the cell, down their electrochemical gradien t and, as is\nthe case in the light reactions of photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation in cellu-\nlar respiration, the proton movement causes ATP to be synthesized from ADP and inor-\nganic phosphate. Most of the photoheterotrophs (= photoenergetic heterotrophs) are\nbacteria that use a form of chlorophyll to absorb light energy and again create a proton\ngradient that can be used to synthesize ATP but require a source of reduced carbon for\nmaterial needs. 342 | CHAPTER 21: METABOLIC DIVERSITY\nFig. 3 ATP synthesis in Halobacterium utilizes a\npigment to pump protons. These then flow back into\nthe cell allowing ATP to be produced. No reducing\npower (NADH) is produced and consequently,\ncarbohydrates are not synthesized.\nIn a similar manner there are chemoheterotrophs (=chemoenergetic heterotrophs), this\nincludes some nitrifying bacteria and some methanogens. These are organisms that \u2018eat\u2019\nfor their material (i.e., reduced carbon needs) but generate ATP by chemical means that\ndoes NOT involve the cellular respiration and oxidation of carbohydrates.\nTable 1 below summarizes the different modes of acquiring matter (carbon) and energy\n(reducing power and ATP).

These mate-\nrials are sometimes considered \u2018food\u2019 (Fig. 1-2) or may be described as nutrients and this\nchapter considers what nutrients are required by organisms and how they are acquired.\nWe have already considered three nutrients, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, that play a\nrole in the energetics of organisms, but they also are important materially. Organisms are\nbuilt of more than just these three and need the others in order to grow. The acquisition\nof required materials (i.e., organismal nutrition) is something that distinguishes most of\nthe organisms considered in this book from animals. Nutrition is highly significant, not\njust to the success (i.e., growth and reproduction) of organisms but also to ecology and to\ninteractions with other organisms and specifically agriculture. For reasons that should be\nobvious already and that are elaborated on further in this chapter, the nutrition of organ-\nisms is strongly affected by their lifestyle, in particular, whether they are an autotroph or\nheterotroph, and also by their evolutionary history.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Chemical (molecular) composition of organisms\n\u2022 Chemical (elemental) composition of organisms\n\u2022 How nutritional requirements are met by heterotrophs and autotrophs\n\u2022 Mechanisms of nutrient acquisition\n\u2022 Vitamins 346 | CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS\nFFiigg.. 11 AArree flfliieess \u2018\u2018ffoooodd\u2019\u2019 ffoorr tthhee VVeennuuss flflyy ttrraapp??\nAArree tthhee nnuuttrriittiioonnaall nneeeeddss ooff VVeennuuss flflyy ttrraappss\nddiiffffeerreenntt ffrroomm tthhaatt ooff ootthheerr ppllaannttss??\nCChheemmiiccaall ((MMoolleeccuullaarr))\nCCoommppoossiittiioonn ooff OOrrggaanniissmmss\nOne of the properties that define organisms is their\nchemical composition, both in terms of elements (e.g.\ncarbon) and in terms of compounds (combinations of\nelements, e.g. carbohydrates).

And since all life is made of the same materials, the\nconsumption of biomolecules by heterotrophs should allow heterotrophs to acquire the\nmaterial required to make more of themselves and consequently to grow. Recall that some\nheterotrophs are \u2018ingesters\u2019 (e.g., lions, caterpillars, humans) swallowing organisms or\nparts of organisms into a tube inside their body where digestion occurs that breaks down\nthe large biological molecules (e.g., proteins) into smaller ones (amino acids) that can be\nabsorbed by the organism. Other heterotrophs are \u2019absorbers\u2019 (e.g., fungi, many bacteria,\nwater molds) and do the digesting outside of their body. The basic process is the same\nin both groups: large molecules are broken down into smaller ones that can be absorbed.\nThree key factors influence the nutrition of heterotrophs: food choice (what they choose\nto eat), digestive abilities (what biomolecules they can break down into smaller units, and\nabsorptive abilities, what molecules they can transport into their cells. These factors vary\ntremendously, especially within the archaea, bacteria and fungal groups. Also note that\nfor absorbers, digestion may be partly or largely the result of other organisms living in\nthe same habitat. A similar situation exists within ingesters because they usually harbor\norganisms within their gut track that participate in digestion. Note that for heterotrophs\nthe acquisition of the nutrients shown in Table 4 may be problematic because the element\nmay not necessarily be in the ingested food, e.g., iodine is not required by plants so het-\nerotrophs may not necessarily acquire it from the food they eat. The same is potentially\ntrue for sodium, but in practice, most plants contain sodium even though they do not\nrequire it because sodium is common in the environment.\nThe nutrition of autotrophs is very different. They need the same elements that het-\nerotrophs do (Tables 2 and 3) but they do not acquire these in a \u2018prepackaged\u2019 form.\nMoreover, many autotrophs can\u2019t utilize nutrients in a prepackaged form. While some\nphotosynthetic protists (algae) and many photosynthetic prokaryotes do have the ability\nto absorb organic compounds, plants have no ability to ingest materials (i.e., no mouth\nand digestive tract), nor can they break down large organic molecules outside their body,\nor even to absorb breakdown products like amino acids, should they happen to be present.\nIn fact, the materials that plants absorb are not \u2018organic\u2019 (= biological), they are elements\nor simple compounds found in the environment, such as CO (carbon dioxide), NO \u2013\n2 3\n(nitrate), SO 2- (sulfate) , PO \u2013 (phosphate) or elemental ions (e.g., Ca2+, Cl\u2013). Autotrophs\n4 4\nhave the ability, which heterotrophs lack, of transforming these elements and simple com-\npounds into biological compounds. By far the most extensive process is the conversion\nof carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates, but many other reactions are essential: CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS | 353\nadding nitrogen groups to carbohydrate molecules to produ ce amino acids, synthesiz-\ning nucleotides, nucleic acids, assorted metabolites (e.g., NADP+, assorted vitamins), etc.\nThis process is made all the more challenging by the fact that the raw materials used by\nautotrophs are all dilute and scattered in the environment. This is in contrast to the mate-\nrials that heterotrophs consume, where all the needed materials are usually found together\nin \u2018food\u2019.\nIn order for autotrophs to acquire the minerals, they need these minerals must be in a\nform that dissolves in water and in a form that autotrophs can acquire (i.e., will pass\nthrough a membrane or through a channel/carrier protein imbedded in a membrane). For\naquatic autotrophs, all of the nutrients that they acquire come from the solution they\nare immersed in. For terrestrial autotrophs (plants), carbon is the sole element acquired\ndirectly from the air, as carbon dioxide. All other nutrients come from the \u2018soil solution\u2019,\nthe water held in the soil. Not only must nutrients be in soil solution, they also have\nto be in a form that the organism can assimilate. For example dinitrogen gas (N ), read-\n2\nily dissolves in water, and readily enters into organisms, but it can only be assimilated,\ni.e., incorporated into an organic form, by a relatively small group of organisms in both\nthe Bacteria and Archaea groups. Plants, other eukaryotic autotrophs, and most prokary-\notic autotrophs cannot assimilate N and need to acquire nitrogen as either ammonia or\n2\nnitrate.\nTThhee rroollee ooff hheetteerroottrroopphhss iinn aauuttoottrroopphh nnuuttrriittiioonn\nA common bumper sticker used to be \u2018Have you thanked a green plant today?\u2019\u2014 the\nmessage being that green plants are essential to all life on earth because they form the\nbase of the food chain. A comparable message is also significant\u2014\u2019 Have you thanked a\nheterotroph today?\u2019 As essential as green plants are, they in turn are dependent on het-\nerotrophs. Heterotrophs are essential to autotrophs (and thus to heterotrophs themselves,\ni.e., this is circular) because heterotrophs put nutrients into a form that autotrophs can\nuse. Without heterotrophs, green plants would be unable to acquire the carbon and other\nelements that they require. When viewed by autotrophs the general role of heterotrophs\nis decomposition, to break down organic material into simple \u2018inorganic\u2019 compounds that\nthey can utilize, a process described as \u2018mineralization\u2019.\nBecause nutrients are diluted in the environment and concentrated in organisms, absorp-\ntion of elements involves accumulation \u2014 the concentration of elements inside organisms. 354 | CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS\nFFiigg.. 44\nAnd this accumulation requires energy and is an \u2018active\u2019 process. Some nutrients are\nabsorbed in the charged (ionic) state. Since the inside of the cell is negatively charged rel-\native to the outside of the cell, nutrients that are cations (positively charged) may actually\nbe accumulated by moving down their electrochemical gradient. In such a situation the\naccumulation might be considered \u2018passive\u2019 (down an electrochemical gradient) but this is\nignoring the fact that energy is required to make the inside of the cell negatively charged.\nFor both autotrophs and heterotrophs, a variety of cellular mechanisms account for the\nabsorption of nutrients. They include the following:\n\u2022 diffusion across the membrane: since most nutrients are charged and since charged\nmolecules do not readily penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular mem-\nbrane, this is relatively rare; however, occasionally it can account for the absorption\nof uncharged molecules, e.g., ammonia (NH )\n3\n\u2022 passive diffusion through channels: Cations are sometimes acquired by diffusion\ndown an electrochemical gradient through protein-structured \u2018pores\u2019 in the phos-\npholipid bilayer. Generally, these pores are selective and only allow certain cations\nto pass through them.\n\u2022 pumps: some nutrients move across the membrane in a process that requires an\nenergy source, typically ATP. This movement involves proteins (enzymes) whose\nconformation changes in response to some process that is energetically driven. Gen-\nerally, pumps account for the accumulation of nutrients against an electrochemical\ngradient, but they could also could also account for enhanced movement of cations CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS | 355\ndown their electrochemical gradient.\n\u2022 coupled ion transport: Since cells are negatively charged, the movement of charged\nmolecules can be coupled to the passive movement of cations into the cell, or\nanions out of the cell. Most commonly, anion movement into the cell is coupled\nwith the inward movement of protons. Coupled ion transport also involves proteins\nand generally is quite specific with regard to nutrients, i.e., there are separate carri-\ners for different ions.\nAbsorption mechanics are significant because all of the elements required by autotrophs\nmay actually become toxic (with levels high enough to inhibit growth) if they become\noverly abundant in the environment (e.g., chlorine toxicity in saline soils). It is also sig-\nnificant that autotrophs often take up elements that they do not require and this may be\nbeneficial (e.g., sodium) or detrimental (e.g., arsenic) to the heterotrophs down the food\nchain.\nAAccqquuiissiittiioonn mmeecchhaanniissmmss ffoorr eesssseennttiiaall nnuuttrriieennttss\nCCaarrbboonn\nFor all autotrophic organisms carbon is acquired as carbon dioxide, either from the\natmosphere or dissolved in water. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and then can be\ntransformed into a variety of compounds by (mostly) abiotic chemical reactions. The\nmost significant reactions are the formation of carbonic acid from carbon dioxide and\nwater; the formation of bicarbonate ion as carbonic acid loses a proton; the formation\nof carbonate ion as bicarbonate ion loses a proton. Carbon is readily exchanged between\nthese pools and all of them can be considered \u2018biologically active\u2019 forms of carbon.\nH O+ CO \u2014 > H CO (carbonic acid)\n2 2 2 3\nH CO \u2014 > H+ + HCO \u2013 (bicarbonate ion)\n2 3 3\nHCO \u2013 \u2014> H+ + CO 2- (carbonate ion)\n3 3\nFor heterotrophic organisms, carbon is acquired in a variety of biomolecules: carbohy-\ndrates, proteins, lipids. The exact mix of compounds depends on the dietary preferences\nof the organism. Heterotrophs can only absorb relatively small molecules (simple sugars, 356 | CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS\namino acids, nucleotides) and therefore often have to break down polymers (e.g., starch,\nproteins) before absorption actually occurs. Once inside the cells of the organism, these\nsmall molecules (e.g., glucose, amino acids) may be oxidized in cellular respiration,\ndecomposing them to carbon dioxide, water, and (for amino acids) some nitrogenous\ncompounds like ammonia. A bsorbed nutrients may also be \u2018reassembled\u2019 into polymers\nor metabolites like NADH that are used for growth or to replace molecules that have been\nbroken down.\nHHyyddrrooggeenn\nFor autotrophs, hydrogen is is acquired in water molecules and occasionally in other com-\npounds. For heterotrophs, hydrogen is acquired in water, carbohydrates, proteins and\nlipids.\nOOxxyyggeenn\nOxygen plays two roles in organisms: a structural role, being a part of most biomolecules\n(carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids) and a dynamic role, being an essential reactant in\ncellular respiration that is subsequently lost as water. For autotrophs, oxygen for the struc-\ntural role is acquired as carbon dioxide that is incorporated into carbohydrates and subse-\nquently into other important biological molecules. For heterotrophs, structural oxygen is\nacquired in the food that they consume. For both autotrophs and heterotrophs, oxygen for\nrespiration is acquired as molecular oxygen (O ) which, for terrestrial organisms, can be\n2\nacquired directly from the atmosphere where it accounts for nearly 20% of the air\u2019s mol-\necules. In aquatic systems, oxygen is obtained from the water where it usually is present\nas a dissolved solute. Oxygen concentrations in water are variable, depending primarily\non exchange with the atmosphere, biological activity and how much the water is being\nmixed (circulated). Photosynthetic organisms produce oxygen but this effect is limited to\nthe region of the water column that receives light. Throughout the water column, oxygen\nis consumed by all aerobic organisms. How much the oxygen levels are lowered by this\naction depends on the amount of living things, their rate of oxygen consumption (this is\na strong function of temperature), and the rate of oxygen delivery to the system. CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS | 357\nNNiittrrooggeenn\nFor heterotrophs, nitrogen is obtained from the food that they eat, primarily from pro-\nteins, but also from nucleic acids and nucleotides. Some fungi, bacteria and archaea can\nacquire nitrogen as nitrate (NO \u2013) or ammonia (NH or ammonium ion (NH +). For\n3 3) 4\nplants, nitrogen is always acquired as nitrate or ammonia dissolved in water. Although\nnitrate and ammonia are considered to be \u2018inorganic\u2019 molecules they are almost always\nproduced from biological molecules as a consequence of the following biological\nprocesses:\nammonification is the production of ammonia and can be considered to be a\ntype of \u2018decomposition\u2019. It occurs as amino acids are used as a source of energy;\nthe carbohydrate component of amino acids is oxidized in cellular respiration\nand the amino group is either directly excreted as ammonia or as some other\nsmall nitrogen-containing molecule (urea, uric acid). All heterotrophs participate\nin ammonification, either by directly producing ammonia, or indirectly by pro-\nducing compounds like urea and uric acid that are readily converted (mostly\nby bacteria) to ammonia. How much a particular heterotroph participates in\nammonification depends upon their diet, specifically how much protein they con-\nsume.\nnitrification is the production of nitrate. Nitrate is produced by the action of a\nsmall group of chemosynthetic organisms (previous chapter) that use ammonia as\na source of energy; as ammonia is oxidized to nitrate, an electron flow is created\nthat can result in the synthesis of ATP. Additionally, some chemosynthetic organ-\nisms use the reducing power of ammonia to reduce carbon dioxide to carbohy-\ndrate. The process first involves the conversion of ammonia to nitrite (NO \u2013) by\n2\none group of bacteria followed by the conversion of nitrite to nitrate (NO \u2013) by a\n3\nsecond group of bacteria.\nAmmonia is uncommon in most soils because it is usually quickly converted to\nnitrate by nitrifying bacteria and also because it is volatile and can be lost from\nthe soil by vaporization, unless acidic soil conditions transform it to ammonium\nion, which is not volatile. 358 | CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS\nMost plants take up nitrate more readily than ammonia, but a few prefer ammo-\nnia. Ammonia is a toxic compound and is rapidly metabolized by plants (and\nother organisms) if it is absorbed.\nThe pools and processes of the nitrogen cycle are illustrated in the figure (Fig. 5)\nand table (Table 5).\nFFiigg.. 55 PPoooollss aanndd pprroocceesssseess ooff tthhee nniittrrooggeenn ccyyccllee..\nTable 5.\nProcess Who does it?

For autotrophs, phosphorus is\ngenerally acquired as the phosphate anion (PO \u2013) which is made available by the action\n4\nof heterotrophs who break down organic material and release phosphate. Phosphate is a\nkey nutrient in aquatic systems and often regulates the amount of autotroph biomass and\nprimary production. 360 | CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS\nCCaallcciiuumm,, mmaaggnneessiiuumm aanndd ppoottaassssiiuumm\nThese ions play multiple roles in organisms, generally being present as dissolved cations\nbut occasionally being permanent parts of molecules (e.g., magnesium is part of the\nchlorophyll molecule). For heterotrophs, these elements are obtained as cations dissolved\nin the cytosol of the cells that they digest. Plants absorb Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ as cations dis-\nsolved in the soil solution. These ions are generally derived from the breakdown of organic\nmaterial (decompositions) and as soil minerals are weathered (dissolved) and put in solu-\ntion. Fungi are unusual compared to most eukaryotes because they generally require much\nlower levels of calcium.\nSSuullffuurr\nFor heterotrophs, sulfur is obtained primarily from protein digestion releasing the two\nsulfur amino acids, cysteine and methionine and their subsequent absorption. While some\nheterotrophs can utilize either cysteine or methionine as a sulfur source, humans and\nsome other animals cannot synthesize methionine from cysteine and therefore methion-\nine must be obtained in their food. For autotrophs, sulfur is acquired as the sulfate anion\n(SO \u2013) and subsequently needs to be reduced to produce all biologically active forms.\n4\nIIrroonn\nFor heterotrophs, iron is obtained from organic material, where it is a universal cellular\nconstituent, albeit in low concentrations. Iron absorption into the heterotroph is some-\ntimes deficient and iron deficiencies may result from an inability to absorb rather than\nfrom a lack of iron in food. For plants, iron is acquired as both the ferrous (Fe+2) or ferric\n(Fe+3) ion. The ferrous ion is much more soluble in water but is much less common under\nnormal (high oxygen) conditions which cause iron to be in the more oxidized ferric state.\nIn this state, the availability of iron is strongly influenced by pH, with less available iron\nat higher pH\u2019s (over 6). Consequently, although iron is very common in soils it is often\nunavailable to plants because it is not in solution, especially at high pH\u2019s. However if\nthe soil becomes waterlogged and anaerobic, iron becomes readily available in the ferrous\nstate and may become toxic. CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS | 361\nSSooddiiuumm\nSodium is common in most water sources, even \u2018fresh water\u2019 sources. While sodium is\nknown to be essential for few plant species, in particular many CAM and C4 plants, it is\nnot essential for most plants. In spite of this, sodium does promote the growth of a num-\nber of plants. At the sometime, like most plant nutrients, sodium is can be toxic to plants\nwhen at high concentrations. Although typical soils do not have sodium concentrations\nhigh enough to cause problems, arid regions commonly do have \u2018saline soils\u2019, soils with\nhigh concentrations of sodium ion in the soil solution. Additionally, irrigation can cause\nan accumulation of sodium, and adversely affect plant growth because irrigation delivers\nsolutes, including sodium to farmland. Not surprisingly plants do not have active mech-\nanisms to acquire sodium, nonetheless, especially in saline soils, it does \u2018leak\u2019 in. Plants do\nhave mechanisms to excrete sodium and also to sequester it in vacuoles. As mentioned\npreviously sodium is generally present in plants amounts sufficient to supply the needs of\nmost heterotrophs.\nMMiiccrroonnuuttrriieennttss ((mmoollyybbddeennuumm,, cchhlloorriinnee,, bboorroonn,, ccooppppeerr,, zziinncc,,\nmmaannggaanneessee,, nniicckkeell))\nFor both heterotrophs and autotrophs these elements are absorbed either in elemental\nionic forms (Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Cl\u2013) or as simple molecules (MnO 2-), H BO. Because\n4 3\nmost of these ions/compounds are not only essential but can become toxic, control of\ntheir movement is important and most, perhaps all, have specific protein transporters\nthat control uptake, movement and sequestration.\nVViittaammiinnss\nA final nutritional category is \u2018vitamins\u2019. These are molecules, not elements, that play a\ncritical role in specific chemical reactions and, for a variety of reasons (inability to synthe-\nsize, inability to absorb, metabolic disorders), may be deficient in certain situations. Bac-\nteria and archaea, whether autotroph or heterotroph, do not have vitamin requirements,\ngenerally because they make these metabolites themselves from the \u2018raw materials\u2019 that\nthey require, or, less commonly, they have alternative biochemical pathways that avoid\nthe vitamin requiring step. (There are, however, multiple bacterial strains found and/or\ndeveloped that have specific vitamin or other nutritional requirements. These have been 362 | CHAPTER 22: NUTRITION AND NUTRIENTS\nvery useful tools for research). Among eukaryotes, plants, like prokaryotes, generally have\nno vitamin requirements, generally because they can synthesize vitamins along with the\nmany other molecules that they manufacture. In contrast, eukaryotic heterotrophs often\ndo have vitamin requirements, i.e., molecules that they cannot make and therefore that\nthey must acquire from the food that they eat. For example, humans, and a few other\nanimals, require vitamin C because they are unable to synthesize it. Plants and most ani-\nmals, including cows, make vitamin C. But although cows can make the vitamin, meat\nprovides very little to consumers, so a diet containing fruits and vegetables is important\nin preventing vitamin C deficiency in humans. Among other roles, vitamin B3 (niacin)\nis a precursor to the metabolites NAD and NADP discussed earlier. Although humans\nand other animals can make niacin from the amino acid tryptophan, they can develop\nniacin deficiencies if eating a diet low in niacin and tryptophan. Plants can make both\nniacin and tryptophan from mineral elements and the carbohydrates produced in photo-\nsynthesis. They therefore never have niacin deficiency and can provide these nutrients to\nheterotrophs that consume them. The vitamin requirements of heterotrophs apparently\nreflect a loss of metabolic abilities through evolutionary time, presumably the result of\nthe fact that the vitamins are generally present in the organic matter that they consume.\nPlants, who do no consuming, must manufacture any required metabolite. Surprisingly, a\nnumber of autotrophic algae groups do have vitamin requirements for several B vitamins.\nIt probably is significant that these organisms are aquatic and B vitamins are water-solu-\nble and hence commonly found in aquatic environments, the result of decomposition of\norganic matter. In some cases the requirement for B vitamins in some algae may reflect\ntheir heterotrophic ancestry.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cGenlisea: A carnivorous plant acting as a trap for Protozoa\u201d by Wilhelm\nBarthlott et al.

They are dynamic\nentities that develop through time in an\norderly and predictable way and are char-\nacterized by a number of processes that\ninvolve matter and energy transforma-\ntions. However, they do not have bound-\naries in space or time and, since they are\nnot discrete, they do not reproduce. In an\necological sense, they are communities\npossessing a variety of living components\nthat collectively, in conjunction with\nphysical processes, carry out a variety of\nfunctions.

The earth is a solid material, derived\nboth from inorganic sources, ultimately rock, and from organic sources, pieces of mater-\nial that are derived from living things. Water pervades the soil as its adhesive properties CHAPTER 23: SOILS | 365\nassure that it sticks to all the particles. Depending on the amount of water, air permeates\nthe soil to a greater or lesser extent. And finally, the fire of the soil is the living crea-\ntures, mostly small, highly dominated by fungi and bacteria, but also including a variety\nof invertebrates, protists, occasional vertebrates and a dynamic population of plant roots.\nAll four of the soils parts are critically important to plants: the solid material is the ulti-\nmate source of most nutrients and provides surfaces where significant events occur; water\nis needed by all plants and also is the medium from which they obtain nutrients; air pro-\nvides the oxygen that plants and many other living things in the soil require; the living\nthings in the soil carry out a variety of processes significant to plants, in particular, the\ndegradation of large molecules into units that can dissolve in the solution and be avail-\nable to plants. Each of these four components, earth, water, air and fire, interacts with\nthe others: living things change the gas composition, the gas composition affects living\nthings; water moves and organizes the solid phase; the solid phase controls the water con-\ntent; the solid components change water chemistry; changes in water chemistry can add\nor subtract to the solid phase. Soils are a web of interactions, and while components can\nbe listed, the whole is much more than the sum of the pieces and the functions of soil are\nhard to attribute to specific components.\nThe D\u2019s of Dirt\u2014Deeds, Dynamic, Diverse\nBiologists (and non-biologists!) should be aware of three key aspects of soils: what they\ndo\u2014their deeds; how they are dynamic, and how diverse they are.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Deeds of the soil \u2014 what soils can do\n\u2022 Dynamics of the soil \u2014 how and why soils change\n\u2022 Diversity of soils 366 | CHAPTER 23: SOILS\nDDeeeeddss\nWhat do soils do? A great deal more than we can enumerate here but some of the most\nimportant to organisms, populations and communities are: holding water, holding nutri-\nents, and changing the chemistry of the water in the soil.\nSoils hold water, usually very significant quantities of water, and this vastly enhances the\npossibilities for life outside oceans, lakes and rivers. While some terrestrial life exists in\nareas with no soil (i.e., on bare rock) , their activities are strongly modulated by the avail-\nability of water, and water is only available when it is raining and for a short period there-\nafter. Unless rain is frequent, the activity of living things is very limited because organisms\nrequire water and when it is not available they must shut down, becoming inactive and\nthereby able to tolerate the dry conditions. In contrast, a soil holds and stores water,\ngreatly prolonging the time that water is available to living things and making possible\na vast diversity of lifestyles and organisms that would not be present otherwise. Because\nthe soil can absorb and store water, soils moderate the pulses of water flowing overland\nwhen precipitation occurs, diminishing the erosion and flooding that would occur with-\nout a mantle of soil. This fact is very apparent if one is in a large paved parking lot when\nrain is falling, or on a parcel of land once the soil has been filled to capacity and can no\nlonger absorb water, or in a situation when rain is falling faster than the soils can absorb\nit.\nThe amount of water held by a soil is greatly influenced by the size of the particles that\nmake up the soil. A term that describes the sizes of particles in the soil is texture. Most\nsoils are composed of particles with a variety of sizes, but soils made up mostly of very\nsmall particles are called clay soils, and soils composed primarily of larger particles are\ncalled sandy soils. There are two main reasons why texture affects the amount of water\nheld by a soil. The first is obvious but often not that significant: texture affects pore space:\nthe total volume between the solid particles which is where water can reside. Obviously, a\nsoil with more pore space has more volume available for water. Surprisingly, the total pore\nspace of different textured soils is not all that different: sandy soils have about the same\ntotal pore space as clay soils. What is different between clay soils and sandy soils is the\nsize of the spaces, and this turns out to be particularly important. Clay soils have many\nsmall spaces where water can reside while sandy soils have fewer spaces for water but they\nare considerably larger. CHAPTER 23: SOILS | 367\nConsider two soils that occupy the same volume, both with \u2018no\u2018 water (although it turns\nout to be impossible to get rid of all the water). The soil can be filled with water so that\nall the pore space (spaces between the solid particles) are occupied with water. A soil at\nthis state is said to be saturated (Fig. 2) and one could determine the total pore space by\nkeeping track of how much water had to be added to the soil to saturate it. A soil can\nonly be saturated if it is in a closed container, one that gravity cannot pull water out of.\nIf holes are opened in the bottom of the container then the force of gravity can pull out\nwater. Significantly, gravity cannot pull out all of the water, but it can pull out some of it.\nIt turns out that gravity can remove much more water from the sandy soil than from the\nclay soil. This is because water is held in small pores much more tightly than water held\nin large pores, and the force of gravity is only strong enough to pull water from the largest\npores. A soil holding all the water that it can against the force of gravity is said to be at\nfield capacity (Fig. 3). To remove more water from the soil one needs to add plants. One\ncould also wait for evaporation to remove more water but this is generally much slower\nthan allowing plants to do it and allows one to see another critical point in soil moisture.\nPlants, like gravity, can only remove some, but not all, of the water remaining in the soil.\nThis is because eventually the soil becomes so dry that plants cannot survive. Soil at this\ndegree of dryness is said to be at a permanent wilting point (Fig.4). Plants do differ in\nhow much dryness that they can tolerate but most plants, in particular crop species, have\nquite similar tolerances. Both field capacity and permanent wilting point define degrees\nof dryness in the soil and actually can be defined in terms that relate to the force hold-\ning water in the soil and to a thermodynamic term defined as water potential. And the\namount of force present is related to the size of pores that still hold water: as soil dries\nthe water remaining in the soil is in smaller and smaller pores and is harder and harder\nto remove. Knowing how much water is in a soil is not particularly useful: a clay soil with\n15 grams of water per 100 grams of soil (percent moisture = 15%) is so dry that few plants\ncould live in it. A sandy soil with a water content of 15% may be saturated and gravity\ncould remove water from it. Consequently, the \u2018wetness\u2019 of a soil is monitored not by\nwater content (percent moisture) but in energetic (water potential) terms. 368 | CHAPTER 23: SOILS\nFig. 2 This figure represents a saturated Fig. 4 Plants growing in soil can remove\nsoil: all the spaces between the soil water from a soil at field capacity. They\nparticles are filled with water. can exert a pull strong enough to remove\nwater from \u2018medium-sized\u2019 pore spaces.\nBut eventually, the only water that\nremains is in small pores and most plants\ncannot pull hard enough (see Chapter\n24)to remove this water and they die (aka\n\u2018permanently wilt\u2019) at a certain level of\nsoil dryness.\nThe amount of water held by a soil between\nits field capacity and the permanent wilting\npoint is important because it represents the\nstorage capacity of the soil that is useful to\nplants. Water added to a soil that is a field\ncapacity will drain out of the soil due to grav-\nity (how quickly this happens depends on the\ntexture of the soil). Water held in the soil\nbelow the permanent wilting point is unavail-\nFig. 3 If the soil is able to drain gravity\nable to (most) plants.

But gravity cannot remove water\nRemember that all the nutrients that plants\nmolecules out of small pores because the\nacquire, with the exception of carbon, come\ncohesive forces of water exceed the force\nof gravity. from the soil solution. Thus the water held by\nthe soil represents not only a supply of water\nbut also a supply of nutrients. Exactly how much of each nutrient (and other solutes) are\npresent depends partly upon the amount of water but also on chemical interactions in the\nsoil. A simple view of soil chemistry is that nutrients can be in one of two situations:\nsolids (i.e., part of the soil particles) or solutes, dissolved in the water. There are a variety\nof mineral salts that can disassociate, putting ions in the soil solution, e.g., Na+ and Cl\u2013.\nThe reality is more complex. The soil is a three-phase system with chemicals not just in\nthe solid-state (precipitated state) and in solution as dissolved ions. A third phase, in\nbetween these two, is described as an \u2018ion exchange surface\u2019 that is the result of solid com-\nponents of the soil breaking down (weathering) and losing (generally) cations, producing\na negatively charged surface that can electrostatically bind cations, forming a \u2018cation\nexchange surface\u2019. The movement of ions from the soil solution onto this surface is less\nspecific and more dynamic than the precipitation of ions from the soil solution into spe-\ncific minerals. While precipitation to a specific minerals requires a match between cation\nand anion, any positively charged ion (cation) can associate with a cation exchange sur-\nface. Which cations are actually held depends on their abundance in the soil solution,\ntheir size, and the amount of charge. For plant nutrition, the key parameter is abundance\nin the soil solution. Consider a soil solution in equilibrium with a cation exchange surface\nand consequently having a certain ratio of Na+ to K+ in the soil solution. If plant roots\nremove K+ from the soil solution, the lowering of the K+ concentration in the soil solution\nincreases the Na+ /K+ ratio and causes Na+ ions to be exchanged for K+ ions on the cation\nexchange sites. This replenishes the supply of K+ in the soil solution. A common applica-\ntion of cation exchange surfaces is in water softeners, devices that remove the calcium and\nmagnesium from water and replace them with sodium, thereby making the water \u2018softer \u2019.\nThis results in a number of favorable consequences, e.g., more effective washing with\nsoaps. A water softener operates by moving water through an ion-exchange \u2018column\u2019 that\nhas been \u2018loaded\u2019 with Na+ (i.e., all the ion exchange sites are filled with Na+). As the water\nmoves through the column the Na+ replaces the Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the solution. Eventually\none needs to replace the ion exchange material because it has become \u2018filled\u2019 with calcium\nand magnesium ions. 370 | CHAPTER 23: SOILS\nHence there are three \u2018pools\u2019 of plant nutrients in the soil: specific solid m aterials, both\norganic and inorganic, the soil solution, and ion exchange sites. Ion exchange can help\nbuffer changes in nutrient supply and explains why soils with higher cation exchange\ncapacity often are generally better soils for agriculture (i.e., can grow better crops). Most\nion exchange surfaces are negatively charged and hence are cation exchange surfaces. The\namount of ion exchange surfaces present in a soil is strongly dependent on the age of the\nsoil. As soils age, specific minerals are produced by the weathering of the soil minerals and\nthe decomposition of soil organic material. Remember that the soil as a whole, and the\nsoil solution specifically, remains neutral: positive charges equal negative charges. This is\nalso true of the solution that enters (e.g., rainfall) and exits the soil as groundwater, but\nthe chemistry of the water flowing out of the soil may be quite different from that enter-\ning the soil.\nUltimately the supply of nutrients (e.g., K+, Ca2+, PO \u2013, SO 2-) in the soil depends upon\n4 4\nthe balance between additions and losses. Processes that add nutrients include: additions\nfrom rain, snowfall and dust; decomposition of organic material into components that are\nable to dissolve in the soil solution; weathering of soil minerals into components that are\nable to dissolve. Processes that remove nutrients from the soil include erosion, leaching\n(the loss of solutes in water as gravity pulls water out of the root zone), and the harvesting\n/ removal of plant or animal material.\nDDyynnaammiiccss ooff tthhee ssooiill\nSoils are continuously changing as a result of a variety of processes. Solid material is con-\ntinuously being added, primarily from the plants that shed leaves, stems, fruits and entire\nbodies to the soil surface and continually add roots directly within the soil. Material is\nalso added by animals and by mass processes e.g., wind and water deposition. Some of\nthe material is readily decomposed, disappearing into the atmosphere (carbon dioxide)\nand soil solution (ammonia, \u2018dissolved organic matter\u2019) within a few days. Other materials\n(e.g., tree trunks, large woody roots) remain for hundreds of years. Water is continually\nflowing through the soil, usually being deposited on the surface by rain/snow and moving\ndown with the pull of gravity. B ut occasionally water moves upwards because of evap-\noration from the surface of the soil. As water moves, it carries material with it, mostly\nin solution but sometimes in suspension (if there is a mass flow). Carried materials are\nnot necessarily transported out of the soil but may be deposited, generally in lower layers,\nwhere the physical conditions (amount of oxygen, pH, size and type of particles) may be CHAPTER 23: SOILS | 371\ndifferent. While the water balance of a soil is generally zero (i.e., inputs match outputs)\nover the course of a year, this is generally not the case for solid material and soils may be\neither accumulating or losing material. Even if the solid and liquid phases are in a steady-\nstate, with losses matching gains, activities in the soil can change its structure. While we\ngenerally think of material in the soil as breaking down because of the processes of weath-\nering and decomposition, sometimes larger molecules are made from smaller ones and\nexisting soil particles may fuse with each other.\nDDiivveerrssiittyy ooff ssooiillss\nBecause soils are dynamic, they are diverse\nand change through time in predictable\nways, i.e., they develop over time. Young\nsoils will have different features than old\nones. The age of the soil is one of the five\nkey factors that determine the nature of a\nsoil (Fig. 5). The other four are: parent\nmaterial (what it is made of), climate,\nbiota, and slope. Parent material can vary\nbetween solid rock (e.g., a lava flow), par-\nticulate mineral material (e.g., volcanic\nash), or organic matter (e.g., in a bog)\nwith a wide variety in between.

Climate, i.e., patterns of rainfall, temperature and the variation in these\nfactors, is important for reasons that should be apparent: temperature controls the rate of\ndecomposition and weathering; rainfall also influences decomposition and weathering\nand also controls the amount of water percolating through the soil. Biota, the forms of life\npresent, influences the types of organic material that are deposited and the rates of\ndecomposition. The remaining factor of importance, slope, is perhaps is surprising until\none appreciates that all of the following are influenced by it: the amount of water running\nthrough the soil, whether or not water may be stagnant on/in a soil, the amount of ero-\nsion/deposition on a site. 372 | CHAPTER 23: SOILS\nBecause of variation in the factors\ndescribed above, soils are diverse. More-\nover, their features are changing continu-\nously depending upon their age. One\nmanifestation of this diversity is the exis-\ntence of layers (horizons) in many soils.\nThe horizons develop because of processes\ntaking place in the soil.\nIn many parts of the world, including the\nnorth central and northeastern U.S. glaci-\ners played a very significant role by influ-\nencing three of these factors: In many\nareas, they eliminated whatever soil was\npresent, thus many soils are relatively\nyoung; the glaciers deposited a variety of\nsoil materials (ranging from sands to\nFFiigg.. 66..

Note that motor proteins are highly significant in multiple ways,\nnot just in muscles. They can divide cells, move chromosomes and produce cytoplasmic\nstreaming, a process that is significant to larger cells because diffusion is ineffective except\nover very short distances. The larger cells found in some of the algae, and especially in\nthe coenocytic/siphonaceous cells (see Chapter 4) are highly dependent on the ability of\nmotor proteins to transport material within the cell. Of particular importance to plants is\nthe ability of a large, multicellular organism to move materials throughout the organism,\na process that is accomplished by a combination of diffusion and pressure flow.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Diffusion\n\u25e6 A simple but insufficient model\n\u25e6 Osmosis \u2014 the diffusion of solvents, including water\n\u25e6 Effects of pressure on diffusion\n\u25e6 Combining the effects of purity and pressure\n\u2022 Plants and Fungi use manipulations of pressure and osmosis multiple ways\n\u25e6 Structurally\n\u25e6 Growth\n\u25e6 Guard cell movements\n\u25e6 Leaflet movements\n\u25e6 Long-distance transport\n\u25aa In the phloem\n\u25aa In the xylem CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES | 377\n\u25aa the patterns\n\u25aa the mechanisms\n\u25aa the problem of cavitation and trade-offs in xylem\nanatomy\n\u25aa rare cases of pressurized xylem\nDDiiffffuussiioonn\nA simple but insufficient model\nFFiigg.. 22 DDiiffffuussiioonn ooff aa ssoolluuttee aaccrroossss aa cceellll mmeemmbbrraannee\u2014\u2014rraannddoomm tthheerrmmaall\nmmoottiioonn rreessuullttss iinn aa nneett mmoovveemmeenntt\nDiffusion is a process familiar to most. While the diffusion of gases and solutes is easily\nunderstood by simplistic models, the understanding of the diffusion of liquids, in partic-\nular water, is much more challenging and is often muddled by the imprecise application\nof terminology. The diffusion of gases and solutes is described as a spontaneous move-\nment from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. The expla-\nnation for this spontaneous process is easily linked to kinetic theory\u2014molecules move in 378 | CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES\na random way because of thermal energy. As a consequence of this random movement,\nthere is a net flow of matter from places where there are more molecules (i.e., higher con-\ncentrations) to regions where there are fewer molecules (lower concentrations). If dealing\nwith mixtures (a gas with more than one component), each component will move inde-\npendently of the others.\nLiquid water diffusion (osmosis) is NOT always from \u2018high\nconcentration to low \u2019\nHowever, this model (explanation) is not readily applied to liquid water with solutes, or\nto solutions in general, largely because the idea of \u2018concentration\u2019 varies. Concentration\nis not as precise a term as one might think, it can be expressed in several different ways\n(mass concentration, number concentration, molarity, molality, mole fraction). In the\nsimplistic model of diffusion, the most appropriate measure would appear to be (number)\nconcentration (number of molecules per unit volume) since random movement would\nmove molecules from where they have more molecules per unit volume to where they\nhave fewer molecules per unit volume. However, when considering the solvent (not the\nsolute), the number concentration is not an accurate predictor of diffusion. For water and\nfor most solvents the number concentration of the solvent changes very little as solutes\nare added, yet adding solutes can have a substantial influence on the diffusion of solvent.\nAnd while water volume changes little as solutes are added, the extent that it does change\nvaries with different solutes. But the effect on the diffusion of water is not controlled by\nthe specific solute added but only by how much solute (number of particles) was added.\nConsider that while the addition of most solutes causes the water to slightly increase in\nvolume (the number concentration goes down \u2014 the same number of water molecules are\nnow in a larger volume), the addition of some solutes can cause water to contract (i.e.,\nthe number concentration goes up \u2014 the same number of water molecules are now in a\nsmaller volume). If the (number) concentration of water is what directs its movement one\nwould expect different solutes to have different effects on the diffusion of liquid, depend-\ning upon how much they caused the solution to change volume (and number concentra-\ntion). And you actually would expect that some solutions (the ones that cause water to\nshrink) would have water diffuse from the solution into pure water. This never happens!\nKeeping all other factors constant, water always diffuses from where it is pure into any\nsolution, regardless of the solute. And, at low concentrations, there is little to no effect\nof the particular solute \u2014 they all have the same effect on diffusion regardless of their CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES | 379\nimpact on water\u2019s number concentration. It is the concentration of the solute NOT the\nconcentration of water molecules that is directing diffusion: all other factors being held\nconstant, water always diffuses from where there is a lower solute concentration to where\nthere is a higher solute concentration. From this, one can conclude that it is the purity\nof water, not its concentration, that drives diffusion. This may seem like a subtle differ-\nence but it actually reflects some very profound features related to the laws of thermody-\nnamics. Purity relates to entropy, and entropy is known to \u2018drive\u2019 spontaneous processes.\nMoreover, our \u2018mental image\u2019, i.e., model, of what causes diffusion, doesn\u2019t work \u2014 sol-\nvent molecules do NOT go from where there are more of them to where there are less of\nthem, they tend to go from where they are purer to where they are less pure.\nThe effect of pressure on diffusion\nA second key reason that the description/model that describes diffusion as occurring\nfrom \u2018high concentration to low\u2019 is deficient is that it fails to consider the effects of pres-\nsure. Pressure is the most familiar reason that fluids move (wind, water flow in pipes,\nblood flow in animals) but these movements are not diffusion, they are something called\n\u2018mass flow\u2019, a movement that depends only on pressure differences, and a movement that\nwill occur whenever there are pressure differences and an open path for fluid flow. But\nwhen mass flow is impossible (because there is no \u2018open path\u2019) pressure can also influence\ndiffusional movement: water will diffuse from areas of high pressure to areas of low pres-\nsure. This is especially important for cells possessing both a cell membrane and a cell wall.\nWhile the membrane allows there to be different purities of the solvent (water) inside vs.\noutside the cell, the wall allows there to be different pressures inside vs. outside the cell,\nand both purity and pressure are important in dictating the diffusion of water.\nCombining the effects of purity and pressure\nAll other things being equal, water moves by diffusion from regions of higher pressure to\nregions of lower pressure and also from regions of high purity to regions of low purity.\nThese two factors can \u2018balance\u2019 each other and it is possible to have NO diffusion between\nan area of low purity and high pressure connected to an area of low pressure and high\npurity. As an example, if you have water of low purity confined in a rigid container (i.e., a\ncell with a cell wall) and it is put into pure water, water will move into the cell, increasing\nthe pressure in the cell. Eventually, a pressure will be reached where there is no more dif- 380 | CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES\nfusion into the cell. At this point, the pressure differences between the inside and outside\nare matching the purity differences between the inside and outside.\nUnfortunately, there is no easily conceptualized model for the diffusion of liquid water as\nthere is for the diffusion of gases and solutes. A rigorous model of the diffusion of liquid\nwater requires the application of concepts from a thermodynamic parameter called water\npotential. The basic idea is relatively simple: osmosis (the diffusion of liquid water) is a\nspontaneous process and any spontaneous process must result in a decrease in the amount\nof energy available to do work (the \u2018free energy\u2019). Generally, two key factors affect the free\nenergy of water (its water potential): the pressure (which increases its water potential)\nand the presence of solutes (which decreases its water potential). Liquid water diffuses\nfrom areas of high water potential to areas of low water potential just as heat flows from\nwarm areas to cold areas.\nFor all organisms the cell membrane and cellular activity allow solute concentration dif-\nferences to develop between the inside and the outside of the cell, resulting in differences\nin water purity between the inside of the cell and the outside. When purity differences\ndevelop, water will flow in or out by diffusion. As long as the purity differences are small\nthis movement can eliminate the purity differences by making the inside less pure (if\nwater flows out) or more pure (if water flows in). However, such water movement will\nalso cause the cell to change volume and if the cell swells or shrinks too much it can cause\nirreparable damage to the membrane, thereby destroying cell functioning. As a conse-\nquence, organisms without a cell wall must either live in areas where water purity is simi-\nlar to what is found inside their cells or they must have structures/mechanisms that lessen\ndiffusion and/or have the ability to either eliminate the water that diffuses in (e.g., the\ncontractile vacuole of Paramecium) or to acquire water to replace that being lost by dif-\nfusion (generally this is accomplished by acquiring the \u2018salty\u2019 water and eliminating the\nsalts).\nFor cells with a wall (e.g., plants and fungi), the wall allows a new \u2018fix\u2019 to living in areas\nwhere the cell is more concentrated in solutes than the external environment (this is the\nnormal situation for most non-marine habitats: fresh-water lakes and streams and terres-\ntrial habitats where organisms are immersed partially or totally in soil whose water is gen-\nerally quite pure, i.e., with few solutes). For these organisms, the rigid wall allows pressure\nto increase as water flows into the cells. This pressure acts to reduce the inward diffusion\nof water and eventually a dynamic equilibrium is reached where the high pressure and low CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES | 381\npurity inside the cell balance the lower pressure and higher purity outside the cell. Water\nmoves (diffuses, i.e., moves by osmosis) in and out at the same rate.\nPPllaannttss aanndd ffuunnggii uussee \u2018\u2018oossmmoottiicc ssyysstteemmss\u2019\u2019 iinn aa nnuummbbeerr ooff\nwwaayyss\nStructurally\nWater can be used as \u2018building blocks\u2019 when it is confined in a structure that will not\nexpand. Living cells, with the combination of a cell membrane and a cell wall, are struc-\nturally strong and plants and fungi use them to form rigid structures that can withstand\ngravitational and wind forces (also discussed in Chapter 3). Evidence for the structural\nimportance of water comes from the observation of wilting: if plants are deprived of a\nsource of water to replace that being lost by evaporation, they loose structural integrity\n(Fig. 3).\nSome plants and fungi produce some structures (e.g., trees, bracket fungi) that don\u2019t col-\nlapse when deprived of water, but for many plants access to water is essential to \u2018standing\nup\u2019 because it is the pressurization of cells that provides rigidity. Central to this ability is\na cell wall that has high tensile strength and resists expansion and consequently allows for\npressurization.\nGrowth\nFor organisms with cell walls cellular growth occurs when the internal pressures exceed\nthe strength of the cell wall, causing it to yield to the pressure inside it. Organs (fungal\nfilaments, roots and shoots) grow as a result of the expansion of individual cells and\nthe internal pressure not only has to push out the cell wall but may also have to push\naway (compress) soil in its path. Thus for plants (both roots and sometimes shoots) and\nfungi, growth may require the production of a significant amount of force. The force to\npower this growth comes from the diffusion of water (osmosis), and very significant forces\ncan be created as the result of the movement of water down its water potential gradi-\nent. Pressures of 2-4 bars (= 0.2-0.4 MPa [megapascals] = 2-4 atmospheres of pressure =\n30-60 pounds per square inch) are common and can be quite effective, as anyone who has\nobserved a dandelion coming up through a sidewalk may have realized. 382 | CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES\nFFiigg.. 33 WWiilltteedd ccuuccuummbbeerr ppllaannttss sshhooww lloossss ooff ssttrruuccttuurree wwhheenn ddeepprriivveedd ooff wwaatteerr..

Pressurization of the guard cells,\nas a result of solute accumulation and subsequent water diffusion into the guard cells,\ncauses the cells to swell and form an opening (a stomate) in between them. A decrease\nin solutes in the guard cells will cause a movement of water out of the cell, resulting in\na drop in pressure and consequently stomatal closure. The triggers that stimulate guard\ncells to accumulate or lose solutes have been extensively studied and include light and the\nconcentration of carbon dioxide. The exact controls may not be the same for all species.\nAt least some plants are able to regulate internal carbon dioxide levels at a \u2018set point\u2019 that\nallows photosynthesis to proceed with little inhibition due to a lack of carbon dioxide,\nwhile at the same time minimizing the amount of water lost due to transpiration.\nFFiigg.. 44 SSttoommaattaall ppoorreess aarree ffoorrmmeedd wwhheenn gguuaarrdd cceellllss ttaakkee oonn wwaatteerr aanndd aarree pprreessssuurriizzeedd..\nLeaflet movement\nSimilar to the action of guard cells, a number of plants have leaves or leaflets that move\nin response to environmental cues such as light, touch and drought, resulting in leaves\nor leaflets whose orientation varies depending upon circumstances. A common example 384 | CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES\nis \u2018sleep movements\u2019 where leaves are horizontal during the day and vertical at night.\nThese movements are the results of changes in the pressure of \u2018pulvinar\u2019 cells, located\nat pivot points. Relatively small changes in the size of these cells are leveraged as a\nresult of their location and can cause substantial changes position of organs involved.

The pressure\ndifferences are created as the result of the diffusion of water. In the phloem, pressures are\ncreated as a result of the addition of solutes (sugars) to the pipe cells, a process known as\nphloem loading, that occurs in regions of the plant called \u2018source\u2019 areas. As a consequence\nof the phloem loading, water flows into the sieve tube elements of the source area, and the\npressure increases, triggering a flow in the pipes. The pressure differences and the flow are\nmaintained because solutes are not just loaded at \u2018source\u2019 areas, they are also removed at\n\u2018sink\u2019 areas, the locations that solutes are being transported to; thus a continuous pressure\ngradient occurs in the phloem, from sources that provide sugars, to sinks that consume\nor store sugars. The exact locations that serve as sources or sinks can change depending\nupon whether a location is producing sugars (usually sucrose) or consuming them. Phloem\ntransport can be up the plant (e.g., from storage sites in the root to shoot apical meris-\ntems) or down the plant (e.g., from photosynthesizing leaves to storage sites in the root).\nLoading of sucrose requires metabolic energy as ATP is used to move sucrose from where CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES | 385\nit is less concentrated to where it is more concentrated. As was the case in guard cells,\nwater movement into the sieve tubes is passive once the solutes have been added. Because\nit is a mass flow, not just the sucrose but any solute that is in the sieve tube will be trans-\nported to the sink. The most common of these other solutes are amino acids, but other\nnitrogen-containing compounds are transported in the phloem along with some mineral\nelements (e.g., K+, Mg2+, Ca2+)\nXXyylleemm\nWater transport in the xylem is also the result of \u2018pressure\u2019 differences but these are actu-\nally differences in tension rather than differences in pressure. While pressure compresses\nfluids, the tension pulls liquids apart, just as pulling on a string exerts a force that acts\nto break the molecules of string. Surprisingly, in certain situations, water has substantial\ntensile strength and can indeed be pulled. The cell walls of all the cells in a leaf are infused\nand coated with water because of the adhesion of water to the cell walls and the cohesion\nof water to itself. When water leaves a leaf by evaporation the remaining water is put\nunder tension (sometimes described as \u2018stretched\u2019, but the water is not being stretched,\nrather it is the material that it is attached to), because the remaining smaller volume of\nwater is covering the same original volume of cells. This tension is transmitted to the\nwater in the conducting cells of the xylem and creates a \u2018pressure\u2019 difference (actually a\ntension difference) that can pull water up the (non-living) pipe cells. What is generally\ndriving the water movement up the pipes (tracheids and vessels) is a tension created as\nwater is lost due to transpiration. However, water flow up the xylem can also occur even\nif there is little transpiration as long as growth is occurring: the diffusion of water into\nexpanding cells can create a tension to pull water up plants in the spring at a time when\nplants lack leaves and transpiration rates are very low.\nWater loss from the leaf is simple diffusion: water vapor at high concentrations (high\nhumidity of the air inside the leaf) diffuses through open stomata to where the humidity is\nlower outside the leaf. The humidity of the air inside the leaf is maintained because liquid\nwater in the cell walls of mesophyll cells evaporates and replaces water that has been lost.\nThe tensions generated by water loss causes the tracheids and vessels to be slightly com-\npressed as the pressure outside them is \u2018normal\u2019 (one atmosphere) but the pressure inside\nis lower. Note that this is in contrast to the situation in living mesophyll cells which are\npressurized because they have a membrane that allows them to concentrate solutes. If the\ntension in the water column of becomes too great, a phenomenon called cavitation occurs: 386 | CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES\nFFiigg.. 55 XXyylleemm ttrraannssppoorrtt ooccccuurrss iinn rreessppoonnssee ttoo wwaatteerr lloossss ffrroomm tthhee lleeaavveess oorr aass aa\nrreessuulltt ooff wwaatteerr eennttrryy iinnttoo ggrroowwiinngg cceellllss..\nair bubbles form when the water column is broken or when water breaks away from the\nsides of the tracheid or vessel. In either case, the cell is \u2018cavitated\u2019 and is no longer useful\nfor water transport.\nIn both transpiration-driven and growth-driven situations, and in phloem transport,\nthere is a short-distance diffusional movement that creates a pressure difference that can CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES | 387\nresult in a long-distance movement. In both the xylem and phloem the movement within\nthe pipes is NOT diffusion, it is a much more familiar process called bulk flow. Bulk flow\nis a much more effective means to transport materials over long distances than diffusion,\nwhich is only effective over very small distances (tenths of a mm for liquids). Bulk flow\nis blocked by cell membranes and is impeded, but not prevented, by cell walls. The pits\nfound in the cell walls of tracheids and vessel tube elements provide a relatively low resis-\ntance pathway for water to move between adjacent cells. Water flows even more readily\nthrough the perforation plates of vessels because the openings are complete (no cell walls).\nIn the (living) conducting cells of the phloem, plasmodesmata connect the individ-\nual cells and bulk flow of phloem sap (which is essentially cytoplasm lacking organelles)\noccurs from cell to cell through the plasmodesmata. Bulk flow is also significant in the\nsoil where there are passageways for water to flow through and where both gravity and\nthe \u2018pull\u2019 by movement into plants can create pressure differences.\nThe pressures and tensions found in vascular tissue reflect these mechanisms. If a sieve\ntube is penetrated, phloem sap flows out because the pressure inside the cell is greater\nthan atmospheric, just as you will bleed if your skin is severed. Under most circumstances,\nif a tracheid or vessel is penetrated water does NOT flow out, rather air flows in, reflect-\ning the fact that the water inside the tracheid /vessel was under tension. In fact, if\none measures the volume of a tracheid /vessel as tensions develop, it slightly decreases\nbecause of compression from the outside. Because of this, tree trunks exhibit a measurable\ndecrease in circumference during the day as transpiration and tensions increase and\nrebound overnight as the tensions are relieved and the plant is rehydrated during times of\nlittle or no transpiration.\nOn rare occasions the water in the xylem is pressurized.\nThis condition is described as \u2018root pressure\u2019 and only occurs under relatively rare circum-\nstances. \u2018Root pressure\u2019 is demonstrated by the \u2018bleeding\u2019 (exudation) from a decapitated\nstem. Under these same special conditions, if one punctures an individual xylem vessel\nor tracheid it will also bleed, unlike the more normal situation described above. Root\npressure occurs if the soil is moist, roots are actively growing, and transpiration is low\n(at night or when no leaves are present). Under these conditions solutes (mineral ions)\naccumulate in the xylem of the root because of the actions of root cells, and because the\nendodermis collectively behaves like a membrane and is a barrier that prevents solutes\naccumulated in the root xylem from leaking back out of the xylem tissue. Hence, like a liv- 388 | CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES\ning individual plant cell which can pressurize because the cell membrane allows solutes to\nbe accumulated, the entire root xylem can accumulate ions and pressurize. This phenome-\nnon is rare, because solutes typically do not accumulate in the root xylem because mineral\nacquisition by roots is matched by xylem transport up due to transpiration. Addition-\nally, \u2018pull\u2019 from the top (created by transpiration or growth) prevents a pressure buildup\nfrom occurring.\nA final situation where the xylem is pressurized is the one that causes sap to flow (out) in\nmaple tree trunks in the late winter and early spring. \u2018Tapping\u2019, inserting a cylinder, into\nthe xylem, results in the bleeding of sap that can be collected, concentrated and used as\na source of sugar. Maple sap flow does NOT require root activity \u2014 it can be observed\nin stems removed from the root system. Maple sap flow DOES require freeze/thaw cycles\nbecause these somehow allow the xylem to become pressurized. The sugars found in the\nxylem sap are coming from xylem rays whose starch is converted into sucrose in late win-\nter. Why only maples and a few other species of trees exhibit this behavior is generally\nattributed to aspects of their wood anatomy. Most tree species do not pressurize when\nexposed to freeze/thaw cycles.\nAlthough phloem tissue is penetrated when maple is tapped and although phloem tissue\nis pressurized and transports sucrose, extremely little of the sap collected from maples is\nderived from the phloem. The living cells (sieve tube elements) of the phloem tissue are\ncapable of rapidly plugging holes to prevent \u2018bleeding\u2019 and consequent sugar loss. If one\ncould tap into the phloem tissue it would be found to have a much, much higher sugar\nconcentration (comparable to maple syrup) than maple sap, whose sweetness is barely\ndetected by humans until it is concentrated. Maple trees that are tapped will bleed from\nthe xylem tissue for several months, as long as they are exposed to proper freeze/thaw and\nas long as there isn\u2019t a \u2018pull\u2019 from the top of the plant caused by growth or evaporation\nfrom leaves. Maple sap flows when leaves aren\u2019t present and growth is not occurring.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cXylem Structure.\u201d Good discussion of xylem transport.\n\u25e6 https://ib.bioninja.com.au/higher-level/topic-9-plant-biology/unti-\ntled-6/xylem-structure.html\n\u2022 \u201cXylem feeding by spittlebug nymphs: some observations by optical and CHAPTER 24: MATERIAL MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S MULTIPLE ROLES | 389\ncryo-scanning electron microscopy\u201d by Laura J.

This is\nespecially the case for plants since, as\ndescribed earlier, plants grow \u2018 out of thin\nair.\u2019 And while plant growth is a very ordi-\nnary phenomenon, its explanation is very\nmuch \u2018extra-ordinary,\u2019 as they are able to\naccumulate scattered pieces of their envi-\nronment and assemble them into an organic\nentity. In contrast, animals need only to\nfind pre-assembled pieces of life, perhaps\nstill living, perhaps not, and reconfigure\nthem to their own use. And while the con-\ntrols on animal growth are straightforward,\nbeing tied to ingestion, what controls plant\ngrowth is less obvious.\nWhen plants grow, they generally get bigger\nboth in size and in weight and the process\nof growth can be linked to increases in\neither. However, for a variety of reasons, the\ngrowth of plants is defined as an irre- FFiigg.. 11 GGeerrmmiinnaattiinngg ssiittkkaa sspprruuccee sseeeeddlliinngg..\nAAllmmoosstt aallll ggrroowwtthh ttoo tthhiiss ppooiinntt hhaass bbeeeenn\nversible increase in size, not an increase in\nssuupppplliieedd bbyy nnuuttrriieennttss ssttoorreedd iinn tthhee sseeeedd..

For example, trees gain a considerable amount of water overnight to replenish\nthat lost during the day; most would not consider the overnight weight gain to be growth\nnor the loss during the day to be \u2018negative growth.\u2019 To avoid the dynamics of water, one\nmight monitor growth with increases in \u2018dry weight\u2019, a consequence of the accumulation\nof carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc., and the synthesis of organic molecules such as car-\nbohydrates and proteins. But defining growth by an increase in dry weight would lead to\nsome counterintuitive results. Most would consider that trees grow in the spring when\nthe shoots elongate and leaves appear. At this time the tree is actually decreasing in dry\nweight. During the summer in temperate areas, as trees photosynthesize and absorb nutri-\nents, their dry weight increases, yet many are not getting bigger in terms of longer shoots.\nSimilarly, a sprouting seed, which most would consider to be growing, is actually decreas-\ning in dry weight until its photosynthetic rate exceeds its respiration rate; this generally\ndoesn\u2019t happen until the seedling is a couple of weeks old and already of substantial size.\nConsequently, plant growth is typically defined as an irreversible increase in size.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Growth processes\n\u2022 Limitations on plant growth\n\u2022 Growth models\nGGrroowwtthh PPrroocceesssseess\nIncreases in the size of plants come about as individual cells, produced by cell divisions in\nthe meristems, expand. While this may seem at first a simple phenomenon, consider the\nfollowing aspects of the process:\n1. All plant cells, even small ones, are surrounded by a confining cell wall, whose most\nbasic function is to prevent expansion. This allows the cell to pressurize and this is\nimportant to plant cell water balance and functioning.\n2. As the cell expands the thickness of the cell membrane and the cell wall outside it\ndo not diminish. In contrast, consider an expanding balloon: as you blow air into it, 392 | CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS\nthe \u2018skin\u2019 of the balloon is stretched thinner and thinner as the static volume of bal-\nloon material is spread over a larger and larger volume. This does not happen as\nplant cells grow\u2013consequently, the expansion must be coordinated with the produc-\ntion of new material for the cell membrane and cell wall; this keeps the thickness of\nthe boundaries of the cell constant. The significance of this, especially with respect\nto the membrane, should be apparent; stretching the plasma membrane is not pos-\nsible, only the tearing of it, and this would destroy its ability to be a selective bar-\nrier, keeping some molecules in and others out of the cell.\n3. A lthough the expansion of the cell is a consequence of water absorption, this is not\na simple \u2018dilution\u2019 of the cell. Similar to what is happening in the membrane and\nwall, the cell is adding intracellular components at a rate that keeps pace with its\nexpansion.\n4. Although the cytosol does increase its volume as a cell grows, it is generally the\nexpansion of the vacuole that accounts for most of the increased volume of the cell.\nAssuming that a larger cell is beneficial to the organism (because it allows it to pen-\netrate more of its environment, important for both roots and shoots), the large cen-\ntral vacuole is a relatively \u2018cheap\u2019 way for a cell to get bigger because the contents of\nvacuole take less energy to obtain than the contents of the cytosol. The enlarged\ncell is not simply a diluted and stretched version of the original one, its walls and\nmembranes are the same thickness as before and the cytosol is the same composi-\ntion as before. The cytosol has increased somewhat in volume but the majority of\nthe increase in overall cell volume is the result of a larger vacuole, which must have\nthe same solute concentration as the cytosol, but the solutes are different and\n\u2018cheaper\u2019 ones are in the vacuole.\n5. The region of growth of a plant is separated, often by very substantial distances,\nfrom the source of materials for that growth. What materials are needed for\ngrowth? We can identify three basic needs: water, which represents the biggest\ncomponent of \u2018new plant\u2019 material; carbohydrates which are used both in cellular\nrespiration, to provide energy for synthetic reactions, and also as building materials\nto make cell walls, cell membranes, internal membranes, proteins, metabolites, vita-\nmins, etc; and mineral nutrients, e.g. phosphorus for membranes, nitrogen for\namino acids, etc. Water and nutrients are coming from the soil and are thus very\nclose to the growing cells of root meristems, but must be transported considerable\ndistances to get to the tips of shoots, up to 350 feet in the case of a redwood tree.\nCarbohydrates are supplied by photosynthesizing leaves, which may be relatively\nclose to growing shoots but may be 350 feet away from an expanding root meristem. CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS | 393\nCarbohydrates often do not directly flow from leaves to growth points but instead\nmay flow from leaves to storage sites and then from storage sites to growth regions.\nCellular expansion is resisted by the strength of the cell wall and expansion occurs when\nthe pressure inside the cell, created by the inward diffusion of water, exceeds the strength\nof the wall. Growing cells have \u2018softer\u2019 cell walls, i.e., walls that yield (expand) at lower\npressures than non-growing cells. And it is believed that plants control cellular growth\nby controlling the \u2018softening\u2019 of cell walls. To summarize, plant growth involves a coor-\ndinated process of the synthesis of membranes (both the cell membrane and the vacuolar\nmembrane), (2) cell wall, (3) cytoplasmic materials (proteins, membranes, metabolites)\n, and (4) some vacuolar materials, along with the absorption of water and minerals. The\nsize of a cell is determined by genetics and environmental conditions. Growth stops when\nthe wall \u2018hardens\u2019 and no longer yields to the pressure generated by water diffusion. In\nthose cells that have secondary cell walls additional cell wall material is deposited after\ncell expansion has ceased \u2014 note that while secondary wall materials are added the cell is\nnot growing in size but is growing in mass.\nMost of the growth of plants is a result of the expansion of the vacuole. This follows\ncell division, which produces new cells roughly the same as the original one, thus produc-\ning what is known as cytoplasmic growth and only a modest increase in the size of the\norgan. Cell division is essential to the growth process because it provides cells that have\nthe potential to exhibit vacuolar grow. Cell division occurs in plants in isolated spots\ncalled meristems and the majority of the growth of plants occurs in areas adjacent to these\nmeristems where the newly produced cells exhibit vacuolar growth. The expansion of\nnewly produced cells pushes the meristematic regions further away from the main body of\nthe plant, expanding the total size of the plant. Thus there is a spatial separation between\nthe region of cell division and the region of cell growth (Chapter 8). This pattern is most\napparent in apical growth but is also the case for secondary (lateral) growth (Chapter\n9) although in both the vascular cambium and the cork cambium cell growth occurs on\nboth sides of the meristem. Activity generally occurs simultaneously in the region of cell\ndivision and the region of cellular growth. Most growth of the organ occurs whenever\nthe new cells produced by the meristem are allowed to expand. For some plants, growth\nis more or less continuous and steady as long as environmental conditions (in particular\ntemperature, water and light) are steady. However, most plants exhibit episodic growth\nwith bursts of cell production and expansion followed by periods of inactivity, even when\nconditions are constant and favorable. For many perennial plants living in areas with sea- 394 | CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS\nsonal climates, growth is strictly seasonal, occurring for only a portion of the year. Often\nthe growth period is only a very small portion of the \u2018favorable\u2019 time period. For example,\nmany trees in north temperate areas grow only for two to four weeks in May.\nThe patterns described above represent the extensional growth exhibited by apical meris-\ntems in roots and shoots (primary growth) and the expansional growth produced by the\nlateral meristems (secondary growth). The growth of leaves and fruits is different; these\ndeterminate organs have a pattern similar to that of many animals where the entire organ\nhas a period of cell division followed by a period of cell expansion, i.e. cell division and\nexpansion are separated in time not in space. There may be a period of overlap where\nboth division and expansion are occurring but usually, well before growth ceases, cells\nstop dividing and no more embryonic cells are produced. Growth is sustained as the new\ncells expand. Eventually the growth of the organ stops and a structure of unchanging\nsize remains. However, these structures do continue to develop: showing senescence and\nabscission in the case of leaves and in the case of fruits showing ripening in ways that pro-\nmote seed dispersal (and this often also includes abscission).\nTwo examples of growth:\nTree buds Temperate tree buds are formed over the last half of the summer. The\nbud contains an apical meristem, a very short section of stem with several leaf pri-\nmordial attached and all packaged by special leaves (bud scales) that cover the\nentire structure. Buds increase in size from their initiation to a time when they\nbecome dormant in early fall but the size increase is modest, producing buds that\ncommonly range from 0.5 to 3 cm. In the spring, at \u2018bud break\u2019 the contents of the\nbud show a tremendous increase in size, producing a section of stem that may be 20\ncm in length with several leaves of comparable length. As was the case with fruits,\nmost of the cells that are present in this new section of stem had been formed ear-\nlier and most of the growth seen in the spring is the result of the expansion of these\ncells by vacuolar growth.\nFruits A typical apple fruit begins its development following fertilization, typically\nin late April. A month later the fruit has grown to but a small portion of its even-\ntual size, with a diameter of 1-2 cm and a volume of about about 5 cubic cm, yet\nall of the cells of the fruit (roughly 75 million(!) cells) are present. Over the course\nof the summer the apple grows to its mature size of perhaps 10 cm with a volume\nof 1300 cubic cm. During this time no new cells are added; there is only growth of CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS | 395\nFFiigg.. 22 TTwwiigg ggrroowwtthh\u2014\u2014tthhee ttwwiigg ggrroowwtthh iiss\niinnddeetteerrmmiinnaattee bbuutt ooccccuurrss iinn yyeeaarrllyy \u2018\u2018flfluusshheess..\u2019\u2019\nTThhee lleeaaff ggrroowwtthh iiss ddeetteerrmmiinnaattee..

In apple and many other fruits the eventual fruit size is\ndetermined by the number of cells produced and thus is dependent of conditions\nin late spring, not those during the summer.\nIn order to sustain growth, a supply of materials is needed, not just the water that powers\ncellular expansion, but the materials to make more cell walls, cell membranes and all the\ncytoplasmic constituents as the cell expands. Not only are materials needed to construct\nthe enlarging cells, material is also needed to supply the energy that is needed for these\nprocesses. Every peptide bond requires the hydrolysis of an ATP, as does every additional\nglucose unit in a growing cellulose polymer. In addition to direct \u2018construction costs\u2019\nenergy is needed for other cellular processes, e.g., the transport of molecules across mem-\nbranes. 396 | CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS\nLLiimmiittaattiioonnss oonn ggrroowwtthh\nMany people are interested in making plants grow more, producing more material in a\nshorter period of time. What is it that limits growth? Below are listed some significant\nfactors, several of which operate in multiple ways. Although increases in all of these fac-\ntors may increase growth, this response is not constant and often tapers off with further\nincreases in the factor, leading to the phenomenon of saturation, where further increases\nin the factor cause negligible changes in growth. Moreover, for all of these factors, there\ncan be \u2018too much of a good thing\u2019 and further increases actually diminish growth (toxic-\nity).\nFFiigg.. 33 GGrroowwtthh cchhaannggeess iinn rreessppoonnssee ttoo iinnccrreeaasseess iinn tthhee aammoouunntt ooff aa nnuuttrriieenntt..\nWWhheenn tthhee nnuuttrriieenntt iiss aatt llooww lleevveellss iitt aaffffeeccttss ggrroowwtthh iinn ccoonnssiisstteenntt,, oofftteenn\nlliinneeaarr,, wwaayy..

CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS | 397\nNutrients\nAll of the required mineral elements can potentially limit\ngrowth. The limitation can come about both because that\nelement is lacking from the soil or because, although the ele-\nment is present, it is unavailable because of soil conditions.\nFor instance, iron is frequently unavailable in basic soils even\nthough it may be present in abundance. The problem is that\nunder aerobic, basic conditions very little iron is present in a\nform that readily dissolves.\nSomewhere on earth, there are soils that are deficient in all\nFFiigg.. 44 TTyyppiiccaall ffeerrttiilliizzeerr\nof the 14 mineral elements required by plants and deficien-\nccoonnttaaiinnss nniittrrooggeenn,,\ncies can develop even for elements like molybdenum that are\nppoottaassssiiuumm aanndd\nneeded in very small amounts.

For example, although additions of nitrogen\noften increase plant growth, if there isn\u2019t enough molybdenum available such additions\nwill not result in any growth enhancements. One can think of growing crops to be like\nbaking a cake: if the cake recipe calls for five ingredients, making a cake can be limited by\nany of the five ingredients, and a lack of one is not made up for by excesses in others. This\nis a very straightforward idea that applies in many situations. But it runs counter to the\ncommon idea that response to factors will always be the constant: \u2018if a little bit is good\nthen a lot must be better\u2019 is generally not the case!\nWhile too little of the essential nutrients can limit growth, too many of the same elements\n(toxicities) can also retard growth. The most common toxicities are the result of saline\nsoils that have high levels of K, Ca, Cl, SO and Na but unique soil conditions (waterlog-\n4\nging) can also bring about toxicities in iron and manganese in non-saline soils. 398 | CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS\nWater\nWater is the most important factor limit-\ning terrestrial photosynthesis worldwide.\nWater plays multiple roles in plant\ngrowth: as a reagent in photosynthesis, as\nthe main constituent of any new cell that\nis produced, as the transport medium\nwhich moves materials throughout the\nplant and in particular to the growing\nregions. While all of the above might\npotentially play a role, the effect of water\nFFiigg.. 55 PPiivvoott iirrrriiggaattiioonn iinn aa ccoottttoonn fifieelldd.. TThhee\ncomes primarily because of the interplay\nssyysstteemm rroottaatteess aarroouunndd aa cceennttrraall wwaatteerr ssoouurrccee..\nbetween water loss and carbon dioxide\ngain. In dry habitats, plants keep their stomates closed to avoid water loss. This lowers the\ncarbon dioxide concentrations inside the leaf and lessens the amount of photosynthesis.\nAdditionally, plants may reduce water loss by having smaller leaves or fewer leaves, both\nof which may limit growth because the total amount of leaf area determines the amount\nof photosynthesis that can occur. While lack of water can reduce growth, too much water\nis also damaging to most plants, primarily because waterlogged soils become anaerobic\nand the roots grow poorly and/or die.\nLight\nWithout light, photosynthesis can\u2019t occur and without photosynthesis, growth cannot\noccur. Light can have a very significant effect on photosynthesis and growth, but only\nwhen other conditions are favorable to sustain growth and only when dealing with light\nlevels comparable to those typically experienced by the plant. Too much light can be\nextremely harmful for a number of reasons and plants adapted to the shade usually do\nvery poorly if exposed to high light levels. For the home gardener, the proper location\nof ornamental plants is strongly influenced by light considerations. The amount of light\na plant receives is controlled both by the intensity of light and by the duration of light\nexposure; the effects do not always compensate for each other, i.e., short periods of very\nbright light are not equivalent to longer periods of less bright light. Most crop species\nare adapted to high light conditions and will do very poorly if grown under shaded con-\nditions and it is probably the case crop growth can be reduced as a result of prolonged CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS | 399\nFFiigg.. 66 SSaatteelllliittee vviieeww ooff KKaannssaass ccrrooppllaanndd..

However, such conditions are often associated with frequent rains and\nthese might also be the cause of decreased growth if the soils become flooded.\nLeaf distribution and longevity are important plant parameters that are influenced by\nlight considerations because of problems associated with self-shading. In general, leaves\nare produced in ways that lessen self-shading and allow for more photosynthesis. Older\nleaves, that are experiencing shaded conditions, are often abandoned (i.e., they senesce 400 | CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS\nand abscise) because they no longer obtain enough light to be profitable in an energetic/\nmaterial sense. This is reflected in the following equation:\nNet photosynthesis = gross photosynthesis \u2013 respiration\nAssuming that the maintenance cost (i.e., that the amount of respiration needed for a leaf\nto maintain its living condition) of a leaf is constant, shading will decrease gross pho-\ntosynthesis to the point that net photosynthesis is negative, i.e., the leaf costs more to\nmaintain than it \u2018makes\u2019 in photosynthesis. At this point it the plant can cut its losses by\neliminating the leaf.\nTemperature\nPlants are poikilothermic, their temperature is not regulated internally but is determined\nby the environmental conditions. Moreover, plants have a range of temperatures within\nwhich they can survive (often this range of tolerance shifts seasonally). All biological\nprocesses, and in particular photosynthesis, respiration, and growth, are influenced by\ntemperature (Chapter 26) and, with a few important exceptions, the basic response is that\nthat plant activities, including growth, increase at higher temperatures in the range of 0\nto 20 C (32 to 68 F). However, all plants have an optimum temperature for growth, above\nwhich growth diminishes with increasing temperature. Part of the explanation of this is\nthat at higher temperatures respiration is more sensitive to temperature (i.e., increases\nmore with increases in temperature) than photosynthesis\u2013thus although gross photosyn-\nthesis might increase, respiration increases more and there is a decrease in net photosyn-\nthesis at higher temperature (see equation above).\nInteractions between water, light and temperature\nThese factors are often intertwined: more light increases temperature and higher temper-\natures increase transpiration and can lead to complications from a lack of water. How\ntightly these three factors are linked depends upon a variety of factors.\nLeaf area\nAs would be expected, plants with more leaf area generally grow faster than plants with\nless leaf area. This is discussed in the following section. CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS | 401\nMMooddeellss ooff PPllaanntt GGrroowwtthh\nWhat limits plant growth is a critical question, one that has a multitude of practical\nimplications. Clearly, plant growth can be limited by adverse environmental conditions,\ne.g., lack of rainfall. But if conditions are ideal for growth, what limits it? Like all organ-\nisms, plants grow by acquiring material and incorporating it into their own structure.\nOne might assume that the ability of a plant to acquire material is directly related to\nits size, with bigger organisms able to acquire more than little organisms. This would\nresult in a positive feedback process of growth: acquisition of resources\u2014>growth\u2014> big-\nger plant\u2014>greater acquisition of resources\u2014> more growth\u2014> even bigger plant, etc.,\netc. This idea can be modeled in a set of equations that are predicated on the idea that\nthe growth rate is a linear function of plant size: more plant, more growth; more growth\nmore plant.\nIn words, this idea can be expressed in two ways:\n(1) growth rate is determined by plant size\n(2) the growth rate, expressed per unit of plant, is a constant\nIn mathematical terms these two statements are:\n(1) growth rate = \u2206S/\u2206 t = k * S, where \u2206S/\u2206 t is the growth rate, the change in\nsize divided by the change in time, S is the total plant size and k is a constant\n(2) (\u2206S/\u2206t) * (1/S) = k,\nFor most biology students this should be familiar because: (1) it sounds like \u2018exponential\u2019\npopulation growth, or perhaps \u2018geometric\u2019 population growth, (2) it is starting to sound\nlike calculus, a course that is often required for biology majors (and perhaps you now see\nwhy!)\nCalculus can lead to the following, putting these in differential form:\n(1 a) dS/dt = k * S\n(2 a) (dS/dt) * (1/S) = k\n(3) size (S) at any time (t) is given by S(t) = S e (k*t)\no 402 | CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS\nNote that while the jump to equation (3) requires calculus, the ideas of equation 1 and 1a,\nand their rearrangement in 2 and 2a, should make sense without it. Equation (3) follows\nfrom either of the first two.\nThus, one might expect plant growth to be exponential, just as you might expect pop-\nulation growth to be exponential. Note that the meaning of the word \u2018exponential\u2019 has\na mathematical meaning that is not equivalent to the one in general use. Exponential\ngrowth is not necessarily \u2018fast\u2019, and indeed, fast is a subjective adjective. In a mathematical\nsense, exponential is described in equations 1-3, although only 3 has an exponent in it.\nOne could develop similar equations based on leaf area (i.e., that the growth rate per unit\nleaf area is a constant), with the argument that leaf area, by controlling photosynthesis,\ndictates growth rates. However, a similar argument could also be made about roots since\nwithout water and nutrients photosynthesis isn\u2019t possible. It is easiest to just assume that\nroots, leaves and everything else are all needed and let S simply be \u2018total plant size\u2019 and\nwork with the assumption that plants can acquire more materials at a rate that is a linear\nfunction of their size (i.e., equation 1).\nBut the growth of plants, like the growth of populations, usually is not exponential, at\nleast not for long. Why isn\u2019t plant growth exponential? A basic answer is that growth\nis not controlled by the rate of material acquisition. It is an internally regulated process\nand it is too simplistic to assume that the rate of growth is a simple function of the\nability of leaves and roots to acquire the materials necessary for growth. The internal con-\ntrols of the plant, including both hormonal controls and molecular controls (e.g., which\ngenes are activated) regulate the processes of cell division and cell expansion and thereby\nthe growth process. In a fundamental sense, this is no different than what was discussed\nearlier concerning the development of unicellular organisms (see Chapter 7 on organism\ndevelopment). A second factor involves meristems or more generally regions of growth. If\nan organism only has a limited region where growth originates and this region has a finite\ncapacity to produce growth, then growth will not be exponential. In the case of a filamen-\ntous algae that grows from a single apical cell, it is easy to see why growth might not be\nexponential. Similarly, an unbranched stem with a single apical meristem might not be\nexpected to show exponential growth although one with branches, and with branches that\ncan produce more branches, might be expected to. CHAPTER 25: PLANT GROWTH\u2014PATTERNS, LIMITATIONS AND MODELS | 403\nAn economic model of plant growth\nA useful analogy for plant growth is an economic, \u2018business\u2019 model. Gross income is first\nsplit between expenses (the costs of running the business) and net income (\u2018earnings\u2019,\nwhat is left behind after expenses have been paid). Earnings can be \u2018invested\u2019 in a variety\nof ways, investments that allow for more earnings, investments that protect existing\nstructures, or in investments that are \u2018frivolous\u2019, i.e., with no obvious benefit. For example,\na baker earns an income from the bread he sells. Some of his income he uses for \u2018mainte-\nnance\u2019 covering the expenses of his bakery\u2013to buy flour, to pay taxes, to pay for the power\nto run the ovens, to repair broken machinery, etc. The income left after maintenance costs\nhave been paid can be invested in a variety of ways: (1) investments in additional ovens\nand mixers or perhaps in a whole new bakery. These investments would increase his earn-\nings and would produce exponential growth. (2) in defenses, such as a sprinkler system to\nprotect his bakery from fire, or perhaps a security system that makes robbery less likely.\nThis might not increase his earnings at all but it does provide for protection against a\nvariety of potential problems. (3) the money could be spent on \u2018frivolous\u2019 items, items that\ndo not protect the bakery. Money might simply be stored under his mattress. Theoreti-\ncally, plants operate in the same way, material acquired (primarily carbohydrates but also\nmineral elements) is used for maintenance and what remains can be \u2018invested\u2019 in struc-\ntures (e.g., leaves) that will allow for the acquisition of more resources, or it might be\ninvested in structures, (e.g., anti-herbivore chemicals) , that protect existing structures, or\nperhaps the material acquired might not have been invested in anything \u2018worthwhile\u2019 at\nall. Note that as long as the baker (or a plant) invests a set portion of his earnings in ways\nthat increase his capacity to earn more income (even if it is only a very small portion) ,\nthe result will be exponential growth.\nThe exponential model of growth is overly simplistic and usually poorly reflects reality. It\ndoes, however, give a starting point from which to analyze growth and the basic idea that\nas organisms (especially plants) grow, their ability to grow (growth rate) increases simply\nbecause they are bigger.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cTree Growth Characteristics\u201d by Jennifer Franklin et al.

As\nindicated by the term, interaction implies\nthat both components affect each other:\nthe environment affects organisms and\norganisms affect the environment. The\n\u2018environment\u2019 includes components that\nare living, i.e., other organisms (the biotic\nenvironment), and components that are\nnon-living such as rocks, clouds, water,\nFiigg.. 11 SSuuggaarr mmaappllee lleeaavveess iinntteerraacctt wwiitthh tthhee\ndead organisms or parts of dead organ- pphhyyssiiccaall eennvviirroonnmmeenntt ((ccoonnddiittiioonnss)) mmuullttiippllee\nwwaayyss:: dduurriinngg tthhee ddaayy tthheeyy aabbssoorrbb lliigghhtt,,\nisms.

The condi-\ntions present on a site can dictate whether or not an organism can exist and, if it exists,\nhow it behaves. This is sometimes described as an interaction between organisms and the\nphysical, or abiotic, environment.\nBecause organisms can affect conditions, they can interact with other organisms as a\nresult. In addition to the interaction between organisms mediated through conditions, 406 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nthere are more direct interactions between organisms, such as one organism eating\nanother or an insect transporting pollen from one plant to another. Interactions are fun-\ndamental to the discipline of ecology. Indeed one definition of ecology is \u2018a study of the\ninteractions between living things and their environment\u2019.\nAnother common definition of ecology is\n\u2018a study of the distribution and abundance\nof organisms\u2019 (Fig. 2). The distribution\nand abundance of organisms are con-\ntrolled by interactions between organisms\nand their biotic and abiotic environment.\nFor example, the distribution of a plant\nmight be limited by the intensity of light.\nThe amount of light available is a conse-\nquence of both the physical environment\n(latitude, degree of cloudiness, whether\nthe site is facing south or north, etc.) and\nthe biotic environment (presence or\nFFiigg.. 22 SSuuggaarr mmaappllee ddiissttrriibbuuttiioonn:: TToo tthhee\nabsence of tree species to intercept the\nNNoorrtthh,, tthhee ppooppuullaattiioonn iiss lliimmiitteedd bbyy lloowweerr\nlight).

In either of the latter cases, one might consider the\nfactors that determine the distribution and abundance of the second species to be con-\ntrolling the distribution and abundance of species A.\nAnother definition of ecology is \u201ca study of biological organization above the level of indi-\nvidual.\u201d As we have seen, organisms have a structure (form, size, organization of compo-\nnent parts), and also organisms have functions, they do things such as develop, reproduce,\nand exchange matter and energy with their environment. Similarly, groups of organisms\n(e.g. populations) have structural and functional features that can be described and cat-\negorized, and explanations can be sought as to what determines their organization. An\nimportant point is that life is not simply organized at the level of the cell and the level\nof an organism; there also is an organization involving groups of organisms and this is the\nlevel of study for the discipline of ecology. CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 407\nTwo entities that ecologists study are pop-\nulations (groups of individuals of the same\nspecies) and communities (assemblages of\nspecies in a particular area). A population\ncould certainly be considered a \u2018living\nthing\u2019 and its distribution across the land-\nscape is a manifestation of biological orga-\nnization and is a structural feature of this\nentity. The abundance of a species (how\nmany individuals are present per unit of\nthe environment) is another structural\nfeature of a population.

Similar arguments can be made concerning the organization of communi-\nties.\nThe final chapters of this book examines of the role of interactions in the biology of\norganisms. This chapter considers the interactions between organisms and conditions,\nexamining the key conditions that affect terrestrial and aquatic habitats, why these con-\nditions affect an organism\u2019s function, and what factors cause these conditions to vary,\nincluding how organisms themselves may control conditions. In the next chapter, we will\nexamine more direct interactions between organisms, trying to see fundamental similar-\nities in the ways that organisms interact with each other. Finally, chapters 28-31 examine\nagriculture, an interaction that we all depend upon, and interactions that are critical to\nagriculture.\nOur approach will be centered primarily on organisms, although many of the topics over-\nlap with ecology and approach the topics from a broader scale. 408 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Temperature\n\u25e6 Temperature\u2019s influences\n\u25e6 Organism tolerances\n\u25e6 Organism growth\n\u25e6 Psychophiles and thermophiles\n\u25e6 Fruit ripening\n\u25e6 Temperature as a cue\n\u25e6 Temperature\u2019s influence on other conditions\n\u2022 Moisture\n\u25e6 Terrestrial habitats\n\u2022 Aquatic habitats\n\u25e6 Salinity\n\u25e6 Oxygen\n\u25e6 Light\n\u25e6 Currents\n\u25e6 Nutrients\nTTeemmppeerraattuurree\nTemperature is of critical importance to all organisms\u2014it affects whether they can survive\nand what they do. Even for organisms who regulate their temperature at a set point, (i.e.,\nhomeotherms), temperature has significant consequences. But temperature is even more\nsignificant for the vast majority of organisms who do not regulate their temperature. For\nsuch organisms, termed poikilotherms, the thermal conditions of their environment con-\ntrol their metabolic activity. Although the temperature is important in all habitats, it is\nof relatively less importance in most aquatic systems because the thermal properties of\nwater buffer temperature fluctuations. But organisms in terrestrial habitats are immersed\nin a fluid (air) that absorbs very little heat energy and has a low heat capacity (i.e., little\nbuffering ability). This makes the temperature of terrestrial systems much more dynamic\nin time and space than in most aquatic systems. One of the key reasons why temperature CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 409\nis important in terrestrial habitats is because it affects evaporation and moisture levels.\nWhile there are some terrestrial habitats where temperature is not a key determinant of\nactivities, from a global perspective temperature and moisture are the major factors con-\ntrolling what organisms are present and what they are doing.\nTTeemmppeerraattuurree\u2019\u2019ss IInnflfluueenncceess oonn OOrrggaanniissmmss\nAll organisms have a range of temperatures in which they can carry out the functions that\ndefine and sustain them. Temperatures above and below this range alter their structure\nand functioning in several ways. The most important alterations are listed below.\nMMeemmbbrraanneess aanndd tteemmppeerraattuurree\nFFiigg.. 44 AA mmooddeell ooff aa mmeemmbbrraannee,, ddiissccuusssseedd iinn mmoorree ddeettaaiill iinn CChhaapptteerr 33..\nMembranes are essential for life, they regulate molecular movement and perform a variety\nof other functions. The physical nature of membranes is between a solid and a liquid;\nthey can be described as \u201c liquid crystals\u201d because part of their nature is rigid and ordered\nwhile other parts are fluid-like (Fig. 4, discussed also in Chapter 3). This duality of struc-\nture is important to their function; they need to be partly rigid because much of their\nfunctioning depends upon the organization of its parts; if these parts are out of place,\nfunctioning is disrupted. At the same time, membranes need to be able to change shape\nand membrane components do need to be able to move laterally; this is only possible\nbecause of membrane fluidity. Temperature disrupts the balance between fluidity and 410 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nrigidity\u2014high temperatures make membranes more fluid and low temperatures make\nthem more rigid (crystalline). Shifts in either direction are damaging. Membrane char-\nacteristics of organisms found in habitats of different temperatures are different in pre-\ndictable ways that relate to the maintenance of a certain degree of \u2018fluidity\u2019. In organisms\nliving at higher temperatures, the lipids are more likely to contain longer chains of hydro-\ncarbon and these chains are more likely to be more saturated. Both of these features make\nthe membranes that they are found in more \u2018solid-like\u2019 at any particular temperature.\nAlong the same lines, it has been found that some organisms that experience yearly varia-\ntion in temperature adjust their membrane chemistry in a way that maintains a constant\ndegree of fluidity in spite of changing temperatures. Thus, the range of temperature tol-\nerance is partly determined by the chemical nature of an organism\u2019s membranes.\nCCoooorrddiinnaatteedd cchheemmiiccaall rreeaaccttiioonnss aanndd tteemmppeerraattuurree\nA second factor involved in both high and low-temperature disruptions of organism func-\ntion is the balancing of the myriad chemical reactions that are taking place inside cells.\nThe rate of nearly all chemical reactions is strongly influenced by temperature, with the\nrates going up as the temperature goes up. Most of these reactions are in some sort of a\nbalance so that, in general, there is no build-up or depletion of metabolites. This balance\ncan be upset at both high and low temperatures because the temperature sensitivity is\nnot the same for all reactions\u2014thus reactions that are \u2018in balance\u2019 at some temperatures\nmay not be at higher or lower temperatures. The biochemistry of cells is such that control\nprocess (e.g., feedback loops) can operate to achieve balance in metabolic pathways, but\nthere are limits to these control processes, and at least some of the problems with high and\nlow temperatures may be attributed to problems with reactions becoming \u2018unbalanced\u2019. CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 411\nEEnnzzyymmeess aanndd tteemmppeerraattuurree\nEnzyme functioning is dependent upon a\nthree-dimensional structure. This struc-\nture can be disrupted by high tempera-\ntures in a process called denaturing\nbecause the thermal motion becomes suf-\nficient to break the relatively weak bond-\ning that accounts for certain aspects of the\nenzyme structure.

The expansion\nassociated with freezing can burst cells, destroying membranes and walls in the process.\nFor plants and fungi, which have a substantial volume of their structure (the apoplast)\nthat is outside of the membranes, freezing (especially if it occurs slowly) generally occurs\nfirst outside the cytosol, i.e., in the apoplast, because of its substantially lower solute con-\ncentration. The freezing outside causes the diffusion of water from the inside to the out-\nside, resulting in desiccation damage on the inside. Because of these effects, a wide group\nof plants and fungi have their lower thermal limit at 0 C, or slightly below it.\nIn spite of this, plants and fungi do live in habitats where freezing occurs. For some, sur-\nvival is the result of an overwintering part that is below-ground where temperatures are\nmore moderate and never go below freezing. For others, e.g., trees and shrubs, the exis-\ntence of perennial above-ground parts reflects an ability to withstand prolonged periods\nof sub-freezing temperatures. Tissues/cells may avoid freezing through two mechanisms,\none involving freezing point depression and the other involving supercooling. Freezing\npoint depression is one of the four \u2018colligative properties of solutions\u2019 \u2014 changes in the\nproperties of a solution that occur with the addition of solutes, regardless of what solute\nis added. Although the presence of solutes in the cytosol does lower the freezing point,\nthe effect is relatively small (up to -2 C at the concentrations of solutes typically found 412 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nin the cytosol) , and protection against freezing by this mechanism is not significant for\nmost organisms. Supercooling can result in much more substantial drops in the tempera-\nture at which freezing occurs. Supercooling describes a situation where liquid water exists\nat temperatures where it is usually frozen. Although supercooling can occur in pure, or\nnearly pure, water, especially if there are no sites for ice nucleation (e.g., under certain\natmospheric conditions that cause supercooled raindrops), in living systems supercooling\nappears to be a consequence of specific antifreeze solutes, proteins or glycoproteins, that\nsomehow prevent crystal formation. Such compounds are found not only in plants but\nalso in fish and insects. The lower limit of supercooling is around -40 C (which is also -40\nF!!!!), but for many species the limit of supercooling is well above this, in the range of -10\nC.\nOther problems caused by freezing are particularly significant to vascular plants and\nrelate to water transport. Water cannot flow in the xylem if it is frozen, and, as men-\ntioned above, the lower solute concentration of the apoplast, and particularly the xylem\ntransport cells, means that water transport becomes impossible when the temperature\nfalls below zero. Since water loss to the atmosphere is almost always occurring because\nthe air is drier than the plant, desiccation will result. This probably accounts for a com-\nmon linkage between freezing tolerance and drought tolerance. An additional problem\nrelated to water transport is that when water freezes dissolved air is excluding from\nthe ice, creating bubbles of air in the ice. Upon thawing, these bubbles remain. This is\npotentially a problem for xylem transport because the tensions that develop during xylem\ntransport will cause expansion of the bubbles and cavitation (air locking) of vessels and\ntracheids, disrupting xylem water transport. This problem may be avoided by the produc-\ntion of new water-conducting cells in early spring, by a pressurization of the xylem (\u2018root\npressure\u2019) that occurs in at least some species as a result of solute absorption in the spring,\nor as a result of physical processes that can eliminate the bubbles.\nTToolleerraanncceess\nAll organisms have high and low thermal limits; if an organism reaches that temperature\nit dies. Chronic exposure to more moderate temperatures can also be lethal, in a manner\nconnected to the length of exposure. Some plants will be killed by a short-term exposure\nat 38 C, but 36 C is lethal if exposure is longer than 60 minutes. CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 413\nEExxttrreemmee ttoolleerraanncceess\nThe majority of organisms have high-tem-\nperature tolerances of around 40 C and\nlow-temperature tolerances of 0 C but\nthere are stages of many organisms that\nhave a much wider range of tolerance.\nThis tolerance is often associated with a\nstage in the organism\u2019s life cycle that is\ndevoted to dispersal, e.g., spores, seeds.\nThese structures serve to perpetuate the\norganism through a time of unfavorable\nconditions. Along with tolerance to tem-\nperature extremes, there typically comes a\ntolerance to desiccation and to a number\nof \u2018insults\u2019 that would normally kill cells\n(e.g., ultraviolet radiation, extreme pH,\nlack of oxygen). This tolerance is a conse-\nquence of an altered cellular structure\nthat simultaneously increases tolerance\nFFiigg.. 66 EEmmeerrggiinngg ffrroomm tthhee iinnflfloorreesscceennccee ooff\nand decreases metabolic activity.

Usually\nthis state of \u2018suspended animation\u2019 involves several or all of the following: accumulation\nof materials such as starch or oils that serve as reserves of energy and reduced carbon,\nchanges in membrane structure, changes in protein structure, changes in organelles (in\neukaryotes), reduction in cytoplasmic volume, desiccation, and, for certain cells, a thick-\nening of the cell wall (or sometimes the addition of a wall to a cell that previously lacked\none).\nGenerally, these tolerant structures are single cells but in some organisms tissues or the\nentire organisms undergo comparable changes in structure and function. In the plant\nkingdom, such tolerant tissues are usually present in seeds and sometimes present in api-\ncal meristems. Such tolerance can occasionally be found in other structures and can also\nbe found in entire plants, especially those found in freezing environments or deserts. The 414 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\ntable below lists prokaryote, protist, fungal and plant structures that are particularly tol-\nerant of extreme conditions. Although the table only tabulates low-temperature toler-\nances, it is important to realize that, in general, high-temperature tolerance, as well as\ndesiccation tolerance, correlates with low-temperature tolerance.

The combined effects of an\norganism\u2019s chemical activity are termed metabolism and metabolic rates commonly dou-\nble to triple with a 10 C (18 F) rise in temperature. While most students generally assume\nthat the opportunity to \u2018do more\u2019 as a consequence of a higher metabolic rate is a desir-\nable thing, this isn\u2019t always the case. Higher metabolic rates require more food because\nan organism\u2019s metabolism runs on cellular respiration. To a certain extent, poikilotherms\nsurvive periods of low temperatures because it costs very little to maintain them under\nthese conditions. Lower metabolic rates mean lower oxygen needs; consequently, many\nplants can survive low oxygen conditions (typically brought about by flooding) much\nmore readily if temperatures are low. 416 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nGrowth and growing degree days For any organism one of its most significant activit ies\nis growth, the acquisition of materials, and subsequent utilization of matter and energy to\nmake the organism larger and ultimately coupled with the production of new organisms.\nThe effect of temperature on growth is nicely seen in the concept of growing degree days,\na statistic that integrates time and temperature and is used to predict the progress of a\nwide variety of crops during the season. While the details vary between crops, and even\nbetween different varieties of a specific crop, the basic idea is that you can predict the\ngrowth stage of a crop species by keeping track of the number of days that the crop has\nspent at different temperatures. For example, if the daily temperatures had a high of 86 F\nand a low of 70 F, corn might take 100 days to reach maturity (i.e., the time to harvest);\nif the temperatures were cooler, with a daily high of 80 F and the low of 60 F, it might\ntake 140 days. Agronomists have developed models to predict how long the crop will take\nto reach maturity based on the accumulation of something called a \u2018growing degree day\u2019.\nBased on its temperature, each day is assigned a certain number of growing degree days\n(GDD\u2019 s), with warm days earning more than cold ones. A typical formula that calculates\ngrowing degree days is the following:\nGDD = [(Tmax + Tmin)/2 ] \u2013 50\nGiven the days listed above, the warmer day is worth (86+70)/2 \u2013 50 = 28 GDD, and the\ncooler day is worth (80+60) \u2013 50 = 20 days. If corn needs 2800 GDD days to reach maturity\nit will do so in 2800/28 = 100 days at the warmer temperatures and 2800/20 = 140 days at\nthe slightly cooler temperatures.\nThis is an example of an \u2018empirical model\u2019, one that attempts to predict things based on\nobservations but not necessarily based on an understanding of how a system operates.\nThe fundamental basis for the model is the observation that crops grow faster when it is\nwarmer. The model is successful in spite of the fact that it has a fairly crude approach to\nthe relationship between growth and temperature. There are a number of features of the\nmodel that are useful to appreciate:\n\u2022 a GDD represents a unit of growth and the basic idea is that plant development can\nbe represented as an accumulation of these units of growth.\n\u2022 a GDD also represents the product of time and temperature; although this is repre-\nsented in its units (\u2018degree-days\u2019), it isn\u2019t obvious in the equation above because the\ntime factor is always 1 day and is not included; the equation might be written:\n\u25e6 GDD = [(Tmax + Tmin)/2 -50] degrees * [1.0] day CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 417\n\u2022 the temperature term has two components, the first represents a type of average, a\nrepresentation of a dynamic (changing with time) variable, in this case, tempera-\nture. This particular average (sum the extreme values and divide by 2) is convenient\nand it is commonly used by meteorologists to reflect daily temperature. Although it\nis a crude type of average, based only on two values, it works well. The other tem-\nperature term (50 in the above equations) might be described as a \u2018base tempera-\nture\u2019, the minimum temperature at which no growth occurs. Although the equation\npotentially predicts an impossible \u2018negative growth,\u2019 if the average temperature is\nbelow the base temperature, this prediction is rarely the case because in most situa-\ntions crops aren\u2019t planted until after average temperature daily temperature exceeds\nthe base temperature.\n\u2022 the GDD concept has been used successfully for a wide variety of crops and also\nwith insects, generally with modifications of the \u2018base temperature\u2019 and/or changes\nin the average temperature term (e.g., letting the maximum temperature never\nexceed 86)\nIf one tried to devise a \u2018mechanistic model\u2019, one that operates based on the mechanisms\nof growth, it would be much more challenging. Growth is a complex process that is a\nconsequence of a variety of chemical reactions occurring simultaneously. Most of these\nare clearly affected by temperature but predicting the net effect of temperature on all of\nthem would be particularly challenging. Certainly, the processes associated with growth\nare controlled by temperature, but the interrelationships associated with growth would\nbe difficult to elucidate.\nVariation in the temperature ranges for growth While the vast majority of fungi, plants\nand protists have an optimum temperature for growth in the range of 25-35 C, there are\nsome exceptions. A number of plants have maximum rates of growth well below 35\nC. Not surprisingly, these plants grow in cooler habitats. While there are a number of\npossible reasons for this, including the possibility that these organisms have membranes\nthat function more appropriately at lower temperatures (see above), or the interaction\nbetween temperature and moisture (see below), another explanation involves the tem-\nperature sensitivity of photosynthesis and respiration. As mentioned above, respiration is\nclosely tied to temperature and for most plants reaches a maximum in the 30-35 C range.\nThe response of photosynthesis is different: it is generally less responsive to changes in\ntemperature and, for C3 plants, it generally reaches a maximum at temperatures below\n30 C, sometimes well below (Fig. 7). The reason that photosynthesis is less responsive 418 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nto temperature is partly due to the fact that some of the key chemistry is photochemi-\ncal and photochemical reactions are not strongly dependent upon temperature. An addi-\ntional factor is that carbon dioxide, a reagent in photosynthesis, must dissolve in water to\nmake it to the site of photosynthesis (the chloroplast) and the solubility of carbon dioxide\ndecreases as the temperature increases. Because of this, C4 plants, which have mechanisms\nto concentrate carbon dioxide, generally have higher temperatures for peak photosynthe-\nsis than C3 plants.\nWhen considering the effects of tempera-\nture on photosynthesis, respiration and\ngrowth, one can consider photosynthesis\nas \u2018making food\u2019 and respiration as \u2018eating\nfood\u2019. As temperature increases in the\n25-35\u00b0C range, plant appetite continues to\nincrease rapidly while the rate of food\nproduction levels off or declines. The net\neffect of this is that at higher tempera-\ntures there is increasingly less food to\nFFiigg.. 77 TThhee iinnflfluueennccee ooff tteemmppeerraattuurree oonn tthhee\npower new growth. Consequently, plant\npphhoottoossyynntthheettiicc aanndd rreessppiirraattiioonn rraatteess ooff aa\nttyyppiiccaall CC33 ppllaanntt.. growth often tails off at temperatures\nlower than one might expect.\nPPssyycchhoopphhiilleess,, CCrryyoopphhiilleess aanndd TThheerrmmoopphhiilleess\nA number of organisms, in particular certain bacteria but also some fungi and protists,\nare termed \u2018psychophiles\u2019 or \u2018cryophiles\u2019 because they do best at low temperatures, some-\ntimes at temperatures below freezing. While the basic pattern of increased activity with\nincreased temperature holds, the range of activity is shifted to much lower temperatures:\n0 to 10\u00b0C and sometimes -10 to 0\u00b0C. These organisms have modified membranes and, for\nthe ones that operate below freezing, antifreeze compounds that allow them to operate\nat such low temperatures. Since a very common mechanism of food preservation is\nlow/freezing temperatures, these organisms may pose problems for the food industry. A\ncryophilic fungus has turned out to be the culprit in the \u2018white-nose disease\u2019 of bats (Fig\n8) , a disease that has recently decimated populations of bats that overwinter in caves with\ntemperatures in the 5-15\u00b0C range. The bat\u2019s behavior of lowering body temperature dur- CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 419\ning the winter (in order to save energy) has provided these fungi with perfect conditions\nfor growth.\nFFiigg.. 88 AA ddeeaadd bbaatt wwiitthh tthhee cchhaarraacctteerriissttiicc \u2018\u2018wwhhiittee bbeeaarrdd aanndd mmuussttaacchhee\u2019\u2019 ccaauusseedd bbyy tthhee\nhhyypphhaaee ooff aa ppssyyccoopphhiilliicc ffuunngguuss..\nAt the other end of the tolerance range are thermophiles, who operate well above the\nnormal activity range of 0-35\u00b0C. As with psychophiles, the vast majority of thermophiles\nare prokaryotes, most often archaea, but there are some thermophilic eukaryotes, all of\nthem fungi. Several of these thermophilic fungi are important components of large-scale\ncomposting operations important to the production of commercial mushrooms where the\nmetabolic heat generation of the compost can elevate the temperature of the mulch to\n80\u00b0C.\nFFrruuiitt RRiippeenniinngg\nOne additional process affected by temperature will be mentioned because of its commer-\ncial significance: fruit ripening. In addition to the influence of temperature on the growth\nof fruits, the temperature continues to affect fruits after growth ceases, in the develop- 420 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nmental process we describe as ripening. This process brings about important changes in\ncharacteristics (aroma, color, taste, texture) that are of significance to both consumers\nand producers. This developmental process is often controlled in various ways by temper-\nature, and temperature can have a significant impact on the commercial value of a variety\nof fruit crops by influencing the appearance of both desirable and undesirable traits. In a\nmore general sense, the temperature can influence the ecologically significant character-\nistics of fruits that affect their role in seed dispersal by influencing their attractiveness to\nfrugivores.\nTTeemmppeerraattuurree aass aa CCuuee\nFor many plants, and some fungi and protists, temperature provides an important cue\nthat is used to coordinate growth and other activities with seasonal changes in conditions.\nJust as gravity organizes plant activity in space, the temperature can coordinate plant\nactivity in time. In this situation, the temperature is not just a condition that the organ-\nism responds to, it is a signal that conveys information about what conditions will be like\nin the future, similar to the way that daylength (photoperiod) can provide information\nabout the coming seasons. However, since the noise in the temperature signal is substan-\ntial, using it to predict future conditions is more complicated: a return to warm condi-\ntions after cold ones could be a January thaw or it could be a real (spring) thing. For\nmany plants, spring is sensed as a warm period after a measured period of cold. An exam-\nple of this is seen in the germination patterns of many seeds. The seeds of most plants\nare shed in a dormant condition. Although some seeds don\u2019t have specific germination\nrequirements, they simply need a few weeks and they are able to germinate (this has been\nselected for in many crop species), many seeds require specific conditions or a series of\nspecific conditions in order to germinate. Especially in temperate habitats, it is often a\ncold temperature treatment that will \u2018break\u2019 dormancy, i.e., allow the plant in the seed\nto resume growth (Fig. 9). This pattern is beneficial because it would prevent seeds from\ngerminating and thereby becoming susceptible to cold until after the harsh conditions\nof winter. Because the original horticultural practices developed to break seed dormancy\ninvolved layering seeds and keeping them moist and cool, such treatment is termed \u2018strat-\nification\u2019. The key part of the treatment is the temperature treatment, not the layering.\nContrary to the normal metabolic pattern, where activity is promoted by warmer temper-\natures (i.e., warmer temperatures produce more response than lower ones), in the strati-\nfication response, activity is promoted by lower temperatures, with colder temperatures\nhaving greater effects than higher ones. Typically temperatures need to be below 50\u00b0F CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 421\n(10\u00b0C) to be effective and become more effective as the temperature decreases down to\n0\u00b0C. Temperatures below 0\u00b0C, and temperature treatments when the seed is dried out, are\nnot effective, indicating that metabolic activity is essential for the response. The process\ncan be modeled in a manner similar to growing degree days, except in this case what is\naccumulated, termed \u2018chill units\u2019, requires temperatures below a certain threshold (typi-\ncally 10\u00b0C), and more chill units are accumulated as the temperature decreases down to\n0\u00b0C. When a seed accumulates enough chill units its dormancy is broken; at this point,\nthe embryo\u2019s behavior is typical of most organisms, and activity (growth) is promoted by\nwarmer temperatures.\nBesides breaking the dormancy of the embryos in seeds, cold treatments are also a very\nimportant cue in breaking the dormancy of shoot apical meristems (buds). Home garden-\ners often bring shoots of flowering trees and shrubs (e.g., apple) indoors to \u2018force\u2019 them to\nflower early (Fig. 10). This practice works as long as the shoot has been exposed to cooler\ntemperatures for a long enough length of time prior to warming it up. Shoots often will\nnot force in December but will in February. The exact amount of \u2018chill time\u2019 that a shoot\nneeds before it will respond to warmer temperatures varies. This phenomenon is a reason\nwhy certain trees may not be able to be grown in southern latitudes: they never receive\nenough cool temperatures to cause them to emerge from dormancy.\nAccumulation of chill units is also a cue for some plants to flower, a process termed \u2018ver-\nnalization.\u2019 In some situations the cold treatment itself is the trigger for flowering; in\nother situations, the cold treatment simply flips a switch and allows the plant to flower\nin response to a second signal (e.g., photoperiod) that previously would not elicit any\nresponse.\nTTeemmppeerraattuurree\u2019\u2019ss eeffffeecctt oonn ootthheerr ccoonnddiittiioonnss\nTemperature is also important because it interacts with a number of other conditions.\nIn terrestrial habitats the most significant interaction is between temperature and mois-\nture. Temperature affects evaporation, and occasionally condensation, rates. Evaporation\noccurs when an individual water molecule is moving fast enough to escape the cohesive\nforces of its neighbors. Since the velocity of molecules is a function of temperature, the\nwarmer it is the more likely evaporation is to occur. The tendency of a substance to evap-\norate is reflected in a property called vapor pressure, which measures the amount of the\nsubstance (in this case water) present in the vapor state when the liquid and air are in 422 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nFFiigg.. 99 GGeerrmmiinnaattiioonn ooff oossaaggee oorraannggee sseeeedd ffoolllloowwiinngg ccoolldd CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 423\ntteemmppeerraattuurree ttrreeaattmmeenntt\nFFiigg.. 1100 AA sstteemm ffrroomm aann aappppllee ttrreeee tthhaatt ttyyppiiccaallllyy bbeeccoommeess aaccttiivvee ((bbrreeaakkss bbuudd,, ssttaarrttss\nggrroowwiinngg,, aanndd pprroodduucciinngg flfloowweerrss)) iinn AApprriill ccaann bbee iinndduucceedd ttoo flfloowweerr iiff sstteemmss ccoolllleecctteedd iinn\nFFeebbrruuaarryy aarree ppuutt iinn aa wwaarrmm eennvviirroonnmmeenntt..

Figure 11 shows the very strong effect temperature has on vapor pressure,\nreflecting temperature\u2019s ability to influence evaporation.\nUnder certain circumstances, evaporation will be directly related to vapor pressure and\nconsequently would roughly double with each 10oC rise in temperature. In environments\nwhere lost water is difficult to replace, temperature can be of great significance to des-\niccation rates and the survival of organisms. For plants and fungi, the combined factors\nof temperature and water availability are of utmost importance in determining species\nabundance and activity. Note that although the temperature has a major influence on\nevaporation, other factors are also important including the humidity of the air, the sur- 424 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nFFiigg.. 1111 TThhee eeffffeecctt ooff tteemmppeerraattuurree oonn tthhee vvaappoorr pprreessssuurree ooff wwaatteerr,, iittss\ntteennddeennccyy ttoo eevvaappoorraattee..\nface area of contact between the air and the water, and the degree of mixing (convection)\nof the air above the hydrated surface. Finally, although temperature affects evaporation,\nevaporation, in turn, affects temperature. In the case of plant leaves, evaporation can cause\nleaves to be significantly (over 2o C) cooler than the air temperature.\nTemperature also affects the availability of certain compounds by affecting their solubil-\nity in water. While the solubility of many solids in water increases with higher tempera-\ntures, the opposite is true for gases, and in particular for carbon dioxide and oxygen. This\nis particularly significant for photosynthesis and, as described above, is part of the reason\nwhy the response of photosynthesis with increasing temperature is not comparable to that\nfor respiration even though both involve a host of enzyme-mediated chemical reactions\nthat generally are enhanced at higher temperatures.\nAnother situation where the decreased solubility of gases at high temperatures can be a\nproblem is flooded soils. The effect of flooding is more damaging at high temperatures\nthan at low ones. Several factors contribute to this: (1) decreased solubility of oxygen\nat higher temperatures, (2) increased rates of soil respiration (carried out by the sum CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 425\nof organisms present in the soil\u2014plant roots, fungi, bacteria, protozoans, etc.) at higher\ntemperatures. Increased respiration means decreased oxygen (3) increased oxygen require-\nments for plant roots because of the higher metabolic rates associated with higher tem-\nperatures.\nWWaatteerr aanndd TTeerrrreessttrriiaall HHaabbiittaattss\nAlong with temperature, moisture is a key environmental variable dictating the distribu-\ntion of organisms on terrestrial habitats. The reasons for this should be clear:\n\u2022 water is an essential component of living tissues and a reagent in many essential\nreactions, including photosynthesis and ATP hydrolysis\n\u2022 in terrestrial habitats, water is nearly always lost to the atmosphere in the process\nof evaporation\n\u2022 for terrestrial autotrophs, who obtain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, evapo-\nration is all the more likely to occur since these organisms must expose themselves\nto the atmosphere to acquire carbon\n\u2022 for plants and animals, water is the medium in which materials move when trans-\nported and, for animals, water is the basis for excretion\nTToolleerraannccee ttoo ddrryyiinngg\nThe vast majority of organisms maintain their moisture conditions at a particular level\nthrough the familiar process of homeostasis. Most plants (and most organisms in general)\nwould be considered homiohydric, i.e., they maintain their water levels at a \u2018set point\u2019.\nTo do this requires that an organism adjust either water gain or water loss. To a limited\nextent, plants adjust water gain: when they get drier, the driving force for water absorp-\ntion is increased and this can result in an increased flux (remember the flux equation!).\nHowever, plants have only a fairly limited ability to \u2018get drier,\u2019 and when they start to des-\niccate their most significant adjustments involve reducing water loss rather than increas-\ning water gain. When plants experience water deficits their response is to reduce water\nloss by: (1) reducing the permeability of the plant to water by closing stomates, and (2)\nreducing the surface area for loss, generally by shedding leaves. Again, remember the flux\nequation and how these changes relate to it. Leaf loss is especially obvious in seasonally\ndry habitats where woody species lose all their leaves and herbaceous species spend the 426 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\ndry season as bulbs or other underground parts, both groups producing and possessing\nleaves only when conditions are mesic.\nThese measures to reduce water loss come at the price of reducing a plant\u2019s ability to feed\nitself. The very significant effect that moisture has on plant distributions reflects the fact\nthat individual, population and species success involves balancing water loss and carbon\ngain. In some situations, a species may be successful by being able to acquire \u2018its own\u2019\nwater source. Alfalfa and mesquite roots often penetrate deep enough to tap groundwater\nsources unavailable to other plants. However, a majority of plants in an area share a com-\nmon water source, the soil, i.e., the roots of many species are occupying the same volume\nof soil as other species, making the supply of water uniform for most species living in an\narea. Consequently, conservation by one species or individual only leaves water that can\nbe taken by other species. Species are successful by manag ing their overall growth and\npatterns of growth. This represents an area of diversification between different species.\nHomeohydric organisms are intolerant of desiccation and die if their water status drops\nbelow a certain level; most plants cannot recover from a loss of 10-15% of their water.\nProbably the main reason for this in vascular plants is \u2018catastrophic xylem dysfunction\u2019\nwhich is a consequence of cavitation and positive feedback loops related to cavitation.\nRecall that individual vessels and tracheids may cavitate if the water in them is pulled too\nforcefully, the result of water loss at a time when there is a restriction of water acquisi-\ntion as the soil dries. Cavitation results in a loss of part of the xylem conducting system\nand this makes cavitation more likely in the remaining conducting elements (see the flux\nequation): increased resistance to flow as a result of cavitation means that there has to be a\ngreater pull (higher tensions) in order to acquire the same amount of water. Thus there is a\npositive feedback loop: cavitation makes more cavitation likely which will make more cav-\nitation likely. Catastrophic xylem dysfunction (no ability to transport water) may result\nquickly after the first cavitation event, leaving the plant with little to no ability to rehy-\ndrate itself.\nThere are a small number of organisms, including a very few animals (tardigrades), some\nprotists, and a few plants, that are poikilohydric: their water status is not strongly reg-\nulated but is allowed to assume the level dictated by the environment that they are in.\nObviously, these organisms can only be successful (assuming that they live in an envi-\nronment that dries out at least some of the time) if they are tolerant of desiccation, a\nphenomenon that is very rare in organisms, although they may produce parts like spores\nand seeds that are tolerant. Poikilohydric organisms can lose up to 90% of their water CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 427\nyet are still able to revive themselves when water again becomes available. The only plant\ngroups where desiccation tolerance is common are in the non-vascular plants, in many\nmosses and some liverworts (ironically groups that are often considered to be restricted\nto moist environments). Desiccation tolerance is also present in a few clubmosses (Fig 12,\n13) and ferns (Fig 14, 15) and in a very few seed plants.\nFFiigg.. 1122 AA ddeehhyyddrraatteedd \u2018\u2018rreessuurrrreeccttiioonn ppllaanntt\u2019\u2019,, aa ttyyppee ooff cclluubbmmoossss tthhee rroollllss uupp iinnttoo aa bbaallll wwhheenn\nttoolleerraattiinngg eexxttrreemmee ddrroouugghhtt..\nWhile there are some mosses that are restricted to moist habitats, most are desiccation-\ntolerant and many are particularly prominent in arid situations, both arid habitats\n(deserts) and arid portions of more mesic habitats, e.g., growing on rocks that have no\nability to store water. Some of these species do have features to lessen water loss, e.g., a\ndrying response that involves coiling of \u2018leaves\u2019 around the stem, lessening the surface area\nexposed to the atmosphere. Nonetheless, many mosses are capable of tolerating extreme\ndesiccation and the whole organism, not just a select part, can remain viable after under-\ngoing repeated cycles of desiccation.

However, water does play an important role in dictat-\ning the organisms present in any particular aquatic environment, primarily because of\nthe process of diffusion. Because water tends to diffuse from regions where it is purer to CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 429\nFFiigg.. 1144 AA ddeessiiccccaattiioonn ttoolleerraanntt ffeerrnn sshhoowwnn iinn ddrryy ccoonnddiittiioonnss\nregions where it is less pure, living things are strongly affected by the purity of the water\nthat they live in, and this is primarily determined by the water\u2019s salinity. All life has the\nability to both accumulate and to generate solutes, and therefore the water in organisms\nis decidedly impure. Consequently, if organisms are placed in pure water, water diffuses\ninto them. The influx of water has two potential results: one is chemical, the cell solutes\nbecome so dilute that normal functioning is impeded; the second is mechanical, the influx\nof water can cause the organism to swell and ultimately burst. However, if the organ-\nism is enclosed in a rigid container the influx of water pressurizes the organism and the\nflow of water ceases with only modest changes in volume. Another possibility that allows\norganisms to live in \u2018fresh\u2019 (i.e., pure) water is to have mechanisms that allow water to be\nexpelled from the organism at the same rate that it enters.\nThe problems associated with the diffusion of water into organisms are eliminated if the\npurity of water is the same outside as it is inside the organism, and there are a number\nof organisms (many marine animals, some protists) that only live in such an environment,\nwhere the purity of the cytosol is comparable to that of seawater. 430 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nFFiigg.. 1155 TThhee ssaammee llooccaattiioonn aass fifigguurree 1144 bbuutt nnooww uunnddeerr mmooiisstt ccoonnddiittiioonnss..\nThere also are habitats, termed saline (\u2018salty\u2019, although the salt need not be NaCl) habitats\nthat have a water purity even less than that of most organisms. Most forms of life are\nexcluded from such saline environments because diffusion causes them to lose water and\nthey cannot tolerate the decrease in the internal water content that results from water\nloss. Organisms that are able to tolerate such environments do so by having more than the\nnormal concentration of solutes in their cytosol, generally adding unique solutes that are\ntypically not found in living things.\nThe problems of life in saline environments are not restricted to reduced water content.\nAdditional problems stem from toxic concentrations of the solutes that make the habitat\nsaline. Generally, this would be sodium and chloride ions but there are habitats where\nother solutes (e.g., potassium, calcium) are damaging. With the exception of sodium,\nwhich most plants don\u2019t require, these elements are essential for living things, but at high CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 431\nconcentrations they can interfere with normal cellular or organismal functioning and\nbecome toxic.\nOOxxyyggeenn aanndd AAqquuaattiicc EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttss\nOxygen is of key importance in aquatic environments. Oxygen readily dissolves in water\nbut its solubility is such that oxygen is generally less available than in terrestrial habitats.\nMore significantly, its abundance varies much more in aquatic habitats than in terrestrial\nones. In terrestrial environments the oxygen levels of the air rarely change much because\nof convectional mixing (winds), due to the much lower density of air compared to water,\nand, to a lesser extent, due to the much more rapid rate of diffusion in gases. Processes\n(primarily biotic ones) may increase or decrease oxygen levels slightly but rapid mixing\nwith the huge reservoir of oxygen in the atmosphere as a whole maintains the concentra-\ntion of oxygen in the air at the normal values of slightly below 20%.\nIn contrast, liquid water is much denser, its movement is much more sluggish and conse-\nquently, the possibility of localized areas in aquatic habitats with varying oxygen concen-\ntrations is much more likely. Under certain situations aquatic habitats will be saturated\nwith oxygen, i.e., holding all the oxygen that can dissolve in water, an amount that is tem-\nperature-dependent and decreases with increasing temperature. As would be expected,\nwater is saturated with oxygen when the air and water are in close contact (i.e., the surface\nof bodies of water) or in situations where photosynthetic rates are high, thus increasing\noxygen levels (generally these areas are also close to the surface). However, there are lots\nof aquatic situations where the amount of dissolved oxygen is not at saturation. Gener-\nally, this is due to the depletion of oxygen by living things and the lack of mixing with\nwater that is in contact with the air, a situation found at the bottom of lakes, in slow-\nmoving streams, and waterlogged soils. Impediments to mixing will make oxygen deple-\ntion more likely. One of the most common impediments are water density gradients, the\nresult of temperature differences. Less dense water \u2018floats\u2019 on more dense water and this\nwill reduce oxygen transfer from surface waters to the denser water below. The density of\nwater decreases as the temperature increases from 4 C; hence, in this range, warmer water\nis less dense than cooler water and a consequence of this is that the water is layered (\u2018strat-\nified\u2019) during the times of the year that it is being heated from above, during the summer\nin northern latitudes, all year round in the tropics. The wind may cause turbulence in\nthe water column and mixing but the penetration of mixing is limited by the density dif-\nferences. The greater the temperature differences between the top and bottom, the more 432 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nresistant the lake is to mixing. Because of this stratification, the bottom layers of a lake\nmay become depleted of oxygen because they do not mix with the oxygenated water at the\nsurface. In tropical areas, low oxygen levels at the bottom of lakes occur year-round, but\nin temperate areas, mixing, and as a result aeration of the bottom layers, becomes increas-\ningly likely during the fall. This is because, unlike the heating of the summer, which rein-\nforces the stratification by making the top warmer, cooling breaks down the stratification\nby making the surface denser. As long as the lake is in a location that cools enough, the\nlake will eventually become \u2018isothermal\u2019, i.e., the same temperature throughout the water\ncolumn. Being isothermal also makes the lake the same density from top to bottom and,\nas long as the wind blows hard enough (how hard depends on the depth of the lake), the\nlake will \u2018mix\u2019, bringing aerated water from the bottom to the top. This is significant from\na nutritional standpoint because organic material settles to the bottom of the lake and\ndecomposes there. Minerals released by decomposition are only distributed throughout\nthe water column when the lake is mixed. Further cooling of the lake in late fall (northern\nhemisphere) once again results in stratification, as the density of water decreases (and the\ncolder water floats on top) when the temperature drops from 4 to 0 C. If the lake freezes,\nthe addition of an ice layer eliminates any wind-driven mixing whatsoever and oxygen\nlevels at the bottom of the lake once again drop if respiration exceeds photosynthesis. This\nis usually the case (although some photosynthesis does take place in ice-covered lakes, it\nis relatively low because of decreased light penetration). In the spring (in the northern\nhemisphere) heating of the surface first eliminates the ice and then eliminates the strati-\nfication, making the lake uniform in temperature and density at 4 C, and again allowing\nfor mixing by the wind. Further heating causes the lake to again become stratified. Thus\nlakes in temperate habitats have an annual cycle that includes two brief periods in the\nfall and spring where mixing is very likely, so long as the wind blows and the lake is not\ntoo deep. This situation, termed spring and fall \u2018turnover\u2019, is highly significant because it\nallows for mixing of the water column, bringing oxygenated water to the bottom of the\nlake (and also bringing minerals to the top of the lake (see below).\nAnother hindrance to water mixing is material that restricts water movement. Sphagnum\nbogs usually have oxygen -depleted water at very shallow depths of a few centimeters,\ndepths that usually receive ample oxygen from the close contact with the atmosphere\nbecause of mixing caused by even slight winds. However, a sphagnum mat hinders the\nmovement of the water column and although the oxygen-rich atmosphere is centimeters\naway, oxygen levels drop to nearly zero at very shallow depths. A similar thing can happen\nin ponds that are covered with a thick \u2018pond scum\u2019 of algae. The low oxygen conditions CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS | 433\nhinder decomposition and result in an accumulation of organic material (\u2018peat\u2019) and low\nlevels of nutrients.\nLLiigghhtt aanndd AAqquuaattiicc EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttss\nAs is the case in terrestrial environments, light plays an important role in dictating the\ndistribution of photosynthetic organisms. It is even more important in aquatic envi-\nronments because significant differences in oxygen concentrations can develop within\nthe water column, depending upon the balance between photosynthesis and respiration.\nLight intensity is influenced by the depth and transparency of the water, the latter often\nbeing strongly influenced by the number of living things living in the water. Since aquatic\nphotoautotrophs need light to survive, they need to be in the upper levels of the water, or,\nin the case of some flowering plants, float on the surface or even emerge from it. Phyto-\nplankton (small photosynthetic organisms that \u2018float\u2019 in the water column) need to have\nfeatures that prevent their settling. Features that are sometimes significant are large sur-\nface area to volume ratios (i.e., not spheres), oil or air bodies that decrease density, fla-\ngella and phototaxis (movement towards light, see cryptophytes). Some phytoplankton\nare known to migrate up and down diurnally, moving up to gain more light during the\ndaylight hours.\nCCuurrrreennttss aanndd AAqquuaattiicc EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttss\nCurrents are very significant in some aquatic environments and can have a strong influ-\nence on community structure. Currents are significant because they can mix portions of\nthe water column, in particular, they can bring oxygen from the upper layers to the lower\nlayers and nutrients from the lower layers to the upper layers. This is significant because\noxygen may be limiting in the lower layers and nutrients may be limiting in the upper\nlayers. Consequently, the current can substantially change the activities taking place.\nNNuuttrriieennttss aanndd AAqquuaattiicc EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttss\nNutrients are often limiting primary productivity and consequently total activity in\naquatic situations. This is a result of the fact that most aquatic environments have two\ndistinct parts: the upper layers where photosynthesis occurs and where inorganic nutri- 434 | CHAPTER 26: INTERACTIONS INVOLVING CONDITIONS\nents are incorporated into biomass, and the bottom region, where there is typically little\nphotosynthesis, but where biomass from the upper layers tends to settle, decomposition\noccurs, and nutrients are released. In such a system the activities of both the top and bot-\ntom can be limited by a lack of interaction between the two parts: the upper layers are\nlimited by a lack of nutrients, hence little accumulation of biomolecules occurs; the bot-\ntom layer becomes limited by a lack of material to eat.\nNutrients transported into aquatic systems can be very important. Nutrients can be car-\nried into aquatic systems by runoff from the surrounding land, especially agricultural land\nwhere nutrients are added through fertilization. Nitrogen and phosphorus often play key\nroles in determining the amount of primary production occurring and the total amount\nof biological activity taking place. However, as was the case in terrestrial systems, there\nare circumstances where other nutrients can play key roles.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cHow Does Deep Water Rice Solve Its Aeration Problem\u201d by Ilya Raskin\nand Hans Kende.

Most students are familiar with the classification scheme\nbelow which organizes interactions into types based on the consequences of the interac-\ntion on the two participants:\neffect on the \u2018larger\u2019 organism\n(-) negative (0) neutral (+) positive\n(-) predation,\ncompetition amensalism\nnegative herbivory\n(0)\neffect on the \u2018smaller\u2019 organ- amensalism \u2018neutralism\u2019 commensalism\nneutral\nism\n(+)\nparasitism commensalism mutualism\npositive\nThere are multiple problems with this scheme and the definitions that stem from it.\nLarger vs. smaller is sometimes an arbitrary distinction. It is not clear what level, organ-\nism or population, it is focused on or how effects might be measured. At the level of\nindividuals \u2018 positive\u2019 might be monitored by organism size, growth rate, longevity or\nreproductive success. But at the level of populations one might monitor population den-\nsity or population growth rate. Sometimes what is \u2018positive\u2019 and what is \u2018negative\u2019 may\nnot be obvious. A bird eating a poisonous butterfly is negative to both the individual but-\nterfly and the bird, but at the population level one could argue that it is good for both\nthe bird and butterfly populations. Some fungi living in plants (endophytes) substantially\nincrease the growth of plants that they infect (positive effect), yet at the same time reduce\nor eliminate the likelihood of producing offspring (negative effect). Nitrogen-fixing bac- CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 437\nteria infecting roots may benefit plants (faster growth, bigger plants) if soil nitrogen is\nlow, but harm plants (slower growth, smaller plants) if nitrogen levels are high.

Predators (Fig. 1) would generally be thought to have a negative on prey\npopulations, but in a number of situations, predators are thought to \u2018benefit\u2019 prey popula-\ntions by preventing overpopulation. Seed predation (e.g., Clark\u2019s nutcracker eating pine\nseeds, Fig. 2)) is clearly harmful to the individual pine organisms (i.e., the embryonic pine\nindividual present in a seed) but apparently benefits the pine populations by allowing for\ndispersal. In short, the terms defined in Table 1 are not always useful.\nAnother way to organize biotic interactions is not based upon arbitrary considerations\nof what \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018harms\u2019 the organisms/populations involved, instead, it is based upon\nthe medium through which the interaction occurs:\n\u2022 trophic interactions\u2014one organism eats another or part of another, obtaining\nmaterial (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) that can be used both for energy (i.e., 438 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nFFiigg.. 22 DDoo iinnddiivviidduuaall ppiinnee sseeeeddss bbeenneefifitt ffrroomm tthheeiirr iinntteerraaccttiioonn wwiitthh CCllaarrkk\u2019\u2019ss NNuuttccrraacckkeerr??\nOObbvviioouussllyy ssoommee ddoonn\u2019\u2019tt ((tthhee oonneess eeaatteenn)),, bbuutt aa ffeeww ddoo..\nburned in cellular respiration) or partially broken down and reformed into mole-\ncules of the consumer\n\u2022 resources/conditions interactions\u2014Resources are materials (e.g., oxygen) that an\norganism either produces, making them available for other organisms, or depletes/\nconsumes, making them less available for other organisms. Conditions are physical\nparameters, e.g., pH, temperature, humidity, light intensity. Conditions influence\norganism behavior, and organisms can change conditions and thereby affect other\norganisms. Resources and conditions are combined here because several can be\nconsidered both as a resource and a condition. Oxygen can be considered a resource\nbecause oxygen can be produced or consumed but it also is a condition that has\nphysical consequences, e.g., oxygen concentrations affect the solubility of ions in\nthe soil solution. Similarly, light is a resource that plants \u2018consume\u2019, reducing its\navailability to the shaded plants below, but it also is a physical condition that influ-\nences all organisms in a number of ways.\n\u2022 work interactions\u2014one organism does work for another organism (work in the CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 439\nsense of physics and chemistry, a process that requires the expenditure of energy,\ne.g., moving material from one place to another, or producing a particular chemical\nor a physical structure).\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Trophic interactions\n\u25e6 Predation\n\u25e6 Grazing\n\u25e6 Parasitoids\n\u25e6 Parasites\n\u25e6 Leftovers\n\u2022 Interactions involving resources and conditions\n\u2022 Work interactions\nTTrroopphhiicc IInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nAlthough all trophic interactions are \u2018organism A \u201ceats\u201d organism B\u2019, resulting in a trans-\nfer of material from A to B, the way the eating is done varies greatly\u2014most familiar organ-\nisms (i.e. animals) ingest into an internal tube where digestion occurs and the products\nof digestion are absorbed across membranes and into the eater. Most fungi digest out-\nside and then also absorb digestion products. For both familiar animals and some fungi\nthe process of killing of prey releases nutrients that can be absorbed with relatively little\ndigestion. And a few organisms, e.g. blood parasites, tapeworms and some fungi, manage\nto get to and live in a place where nutrients are available without digestion.\nAs will be seen in some of the examples below it may be the case that the most significant\nconsequences of the trophic interaction do not involve material gain and loss.\nBelow are four categories of trophic interactions. The categories are based on the manner\nof the interaction between the two \u2018players\u2019: the organisms doing the eating (\u2018eater\u2019) and\nthe organism being eaten (the \u2018eatee\u2019). In two categories, predation and parasitoids, the\neatee is killed because of the interaction, while in the another two categories, grazing and 440 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nparasitism, the eatee is not necessarily killed. And in a final category, (\u2018saprophagy\u2019) the\neatee was killed prior to the eating event. An assumption that holds most but not all of\nthe time is that the eater always benefits. However, sometimes the material ingested is\ntoxic or contains pathogens. As for the eatee, in predation and parasitoids it is clear that\nthe individual is harmed, but, as mentioned above, the consequences may be different at\nthe population level.\nPredation\nFFiigg.. 33 RReedd ccrroossssbbiillllss hhaavvee aa ssppeecciiaalliizzeedd bbiillll tthhaatt aalllloowwss tthheemm ttoo ooppeenn tthhee\nccoonneess ooff ccoonniiffeerrss aanndd pprreeddaattee oonn tthhee sseeeeddss iinnssiiddee..\nThis trophic interaction kills prey (the \u2018eatee\u2019, the organism being eaten) and the eater,\nthe predator, consumes multiple prey items during its life (Fig. 3). All forms of life (even\npredators) are subject to predation but for plants this most commonly occurs when the\neatee is small: when they are pollen (tiny haploid male plants), seeds (\u2018seed predation\u2019),\nor in the consumption of seedlings. The materials found in a pollen or seeds are partic-\nularly nutritious per unit weight because, compared to larger plants, they have relatively\nless structural material (i.e., cell walls) and relatively high concentrations of minerals\nand vitamins. Similarly, fungal spores as prey items are more nutrient rich than the\nhyphal strands. Predation is very important in aquatic systems where the base of the food CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 441\nchain are typically phytoplankton (unicellular photosynthetic autotrophs: cyanobacteria,\ndiatoms, cryptophytes and unicellular green algae) that are preyed upon by zooplankton.\nIn predation the eater benefits from the nutrients and energy obtained (assuming that\neatee does not contain toxins that the eater cannot handle) and the eatee is eliminated.\nFor as long as seed plants have existed this interaction has driven evolutionary changes\ninvolving chemical, physical and phenological (timing) changes in plants, and consequent\nchanges in predators. Particularly significant to plants is the fact that this interaction\nhas developed into a means of dispersal, e.g. the consumption of pollen led to the devel-\nopment of pollination, with the eater transferring pollen from one plant to another.\nAlthough not as ubiquitous, a similar situation has developed into a mechanism of seed\ndispersal, utilizing an eater\u2019s mobility and perhaps its caching behavior (see the reading\non pines and the Clark\u2019s Nutcracker). Both of these interactions are discussed below as\n\u2018work\u2019 interactions. Similarly, seed predation also was a driving force in the develop-\nment of fleshy fruits as a means of seed dispersal: plants developed features that would\nreward the eatee in a way that did not involve (permanently) consuming the seed and\nkilling its embryo. Seed predation also accounts for some fruit structures that protect\nthe seeds inside (e.g., nuts), although seed predators have responded by developing struc-\ntures (sharp teeth of saki monkeys or beaks of goldfinch, Fig. 4) and behaviors that allow\nthem to open seeds, or digestive systems that grind the seed coat or fruit coat away.\nAlthough one hears of \u2018carnivorous\u2019 or \u2018predatory\u2019 plants, the names are misleading.\nThese plants certainly do kill \u2018prey\u2019 but they do not obtain food from them, in the\nsense of materials that can be utilized in cellular respiration. Predatory plants are pho-\ntosynthetic autotrophs and their food (carbon and energy) requirements are satisfied by\nphotosynthesis. For these plants \u2018predation\u2019 is connected to mineral nutrition. This is\ndiscussed further below as involving changes in conditions.\nThere are some photosynthetic organisms that are also heterotrophic (i.e. they are\nmixotrophs). Both the euglena and dinoflagellate groups include predatory members,\nsome of which are also capable of photosynthesis. [Note that the adjective \u2018mixotrophic\u2019\ncan be applied both to these two groups and also to specific organisms within these\ntwo groups, i.e. both these groups have three types of organisms: solely photosynthetic,\nsolely heterotrophic, and members that can be both depending upon circumstances.] The\npredatory dinoflagellates and euglenoids capture prey via phagocytosis. In addition, some\ndinoflagellates kill prey with toxins and then digest and absorb them. And a few of each\ngroup could be considered both parasites and parasitoids, defined below. 442 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nConsidering the solely heterotrophic groups considered in this text, cellular and plas-\nmodial slime molds are sometimes predatory and a few fungi are predators in the classic\nsense (i.e., they capture prey and kill them, http://www.mykoweb.com/articles/Fungal-\nSnares.html). Although they don\u2019t capture prey in the classic sense, plant pathogens\nthat are described as \u2018nectrotrophic\u2019 (see Chapter 30) are predators that kill plants and\nthen consume them. Examples include: Pythium, a water mold (Oomycete) that causes\n\u2018damping off\u2019 of seedlings; the ascomycete fungus that causes dutch elm disease; and the\nascomycete fungi that cause wilt diseases in tomatoes. The pathogen may produce toxins\nthat kill cells, and eventually entire organisms, or, in the case of the wilt diseases and of\ndutch elm disease, produce chemicals that plug the xylem tissue and eventually kill the\nplant by preventing water transport. Other pathogens of plants might be considered par-\nasitoids or parasites, discussed below. But the majority of inanimate heterotrophs are\nsaprophytes, also described below.\nFFiigg.. 44 AAmmeerriiccaann GGoollddfifinncchh iiss ccoommmmoonnllyy ffeeeedd oonn tthhiissttllee oorr ssuunnflfloowweerr \u2018\u2018sseeeeddss\u2019\u2019 ((aaccttuuaallllyy\nffrruuiittss)) aatt ffeeeeddeerrss,, bbuutt ccaann eeaatt aa wwiiddee vvaarriieettyy ooff ssppeecciieess,, iinncclluuddiinngg mmaannyy ggrraasssseess..

Most familiar examples of herbivory (eating of plants) are\ngrazing: cows eating grass, deer eating shrubs, Japanese beetles (Fig. 5) eating ornamental\nplants. While most familiar grazing is on plants and on their leaves, organisms graze on\nother plant parts: stems, flowers, roots.

A few non-photosynthetic protists e.g., plasmodial slime molds, and\nmany fungi are also grazed. Grazing is most likely to occur on organisms that have inde-\nterminate growth.\nGrazing affects the eatee in two ways: by the loss of structure that is used to acquire mat-\nter and energy (e.g. leaf loss in photosynthetic plants), and also because of the loss of\nnutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) that are removed by grazers and are relatively\nhard to replace. Too much grazing can be fatal for the eatee but lesser amounts of grazing\nsometimes actually produce \u2018beneficial\u2019 (depending upon definitions and perspectives!)\nresults; for instance, grazing of apical meristems can induce branching and produce a 444 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nplant that actually produces more leaves, flowers and fruits. Artificial grazing, i.e. prun-\ning, is a very common horticultural technique to improve yield and quality.\nFFiigg.. 66 AA lleeaaff hhooppppeerr,, aa ggrraazzeerr tthhaatt oofftteenn sspprreeaaddss ddiisseeaassee ffrroomm oonnee ppllaanntt ttoo aannootthheerr..\nOne particularly significant aspect of grazing is that it is a means of disease transmission\nbetween individuals, such as a mosquito (a grazer) spreading malaria. Leafhoppers and\naphids are both insects that have piercing mouthparts to acquire nutrients from phloem\ntissue in leaves and stems. If they move from an infected plant to another plant they can\ntransmit pathogens (viruses, bacteria and others) in the process, and often this is the most\nsignificant aspect of their grazing (Fig. 6). CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 445\nParasitoids\nThe distinctive feature here is that the reproduction of\nthe eater is obligately and directly associated with the\ntrophic event and also that the eatee dies as a result of the\nassociation. While any heteterotroph must consume food\nin order to acquire the matter and energy needed to\nreproduce, in the case of parasitoids the connection is\ndirect because a propagule (usually a fertilized egg) is\ndeposited on the eatee.

In addition to being predators on nematodes there are some fungi that could\nbe considered parasitoids on nematodes, the distinction being that predators capture and\nkill prey and parasitoids \u2018enter\u2019 and then kill prey. There are also some chytrids that might\nbe considered parasitoids, with some attacking both pollen and unicellular algae (phyto-\nplankton). Interestingly, the zooplankton that normally feed on phytoplankton may\nswitch to eating chytrids, thus there appears an additional link in the food chain (phyto-\nplankton\u2013>chytrids\u2013>zooplankton). Another fungal group that could be described as\nparasitoids are some of the smut fungi. It should be noted, however, the range of lifestyles\npresent in fungi makes the predator/parasite/parasitoid distinctions challenging.\nA final parasitoid interaction to mention, because it is sometimes economically signifi-\ncant, involves insects eating seeds e.g., granary weevils (Fig. 7) and acorn weevils, where 446 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nadult insects deposit their eggs in seeds (see this short video by National Geographic on\nthe acorn weevil: https://vimeo.com/38056185).\nParasites\nFFiigg.. 88 TThhee oorraannggee ssttrriinnggss aarree ddooddddeerr,, aa ppaarraassiittiicc ppllaanntt tthhaatt ccoonnnneeccttss ttoo\ntthhee pphhllooeemm ttiissssuuee ooff iittss hhoosstt ttoo aaccqquuiirree nnuuttrriieennttss..\nIn parasitism, as in grazing, the eater generally does not kill the eatee, but in contrast to\ngrazing, the eater generally only feeds upon one host and thus is not typically a means of\nspreading disease from one eatee to another. Evolutionarily, one might argue that para-\nsites (and perhaps some grazers) adopt a strategy of keeping their host alive in order to\nassure a food supply for a longer time. Going one step further, it may be beneficial for the\neater to make the eatee more vigorous, which is the case with mycorrhizae where fungi\nfeed off their hosts but somehow allow them to grow more vigorously. Thus, although the\neater in parasitic relationships always benefits because of the material gained, the effect\non the individual eatee can range from increased longevity and vigor, through indiffer-\nence (with no apparent influence on the longevity of the host), to definite adverse effects\nresulting from lost material and sometimes ultimately resulting in death. Looking at the\nclassic scheme (Table 1) the bottom line depicts the multiple consequences of this type CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 447\nof trophic parasitism. The term parasite is also applied to situations that do not involve\nfeeding (see the work interactions discussed below). Parasitic interactions abound and\nnearly all of the inanimate groups covered in this text are at times both the eatee and the\neater. A few of the interesting cases are discussed below.\nRed algae parasitize other red algae, often the parasitizing a close relative, a situation\nthat is also common in insects. There are brown algae that parasitize other brown algae.\nThere are green algal parasites of insects and dinoflagellate parasites of crabs. It is also\ninteresting to note that the apicomplexa, a group that includes Plasmodium, the causal\norganism for malaria, along with other significant parasites of humans, are considered to\nbe derived from a group of pigmented ancestors that also gave rise to the red algae and\nthe dinoflagellates. Fungi are often parasites on a variety of hosts, notably plants and\nother fungi. And even some plants are parasites, both on other plants as well as on fungi,\nexamples below.\nThere are a number of fungi called biotrophic fungi (see Chapter 30), including the\nimportant plant pathogens powdery mildews and rusts, that feed off of living plant tissue\nand would be considered parasites. They produce structures called haustoria that pene-\ntrate the cell wall and interact with the plant cell plasma membrane, providing them with\naccess to materials (e.g., sugars, amino acids) present in the cytosol. Dodder (Fig. 9), a\nnon-photosynthetic flowering plant, also produces haustoria. These penetrate into the\nphloem tissue of their hosts and provide them with nutrition. T he fungal component\nof mycorrhizae would be considered parasites, as would be the nitrogen-fixing bacteria\nthat form galls in some plants. Indeed, most gall-forming organisms (insects, fungi, mites)\nwould be considered parasites. The gall is an abnormal growth induced by the presence of\nthe parasite. The parasite is fed by its host and ultimately exits the gall.\nAs an example see \u201cThe Amazing Tale of Sagebrush Galls\u201d by Susan Ballinger at\nwww.wenatcheenaturalist.com/sagebrush-galls/ or \u201cInside the Goldenrod Gal\u201d on the Fin-\nger Lakes Land Trust blog at www.fllt.org/inside-the-goldenrod-gall/. Most of these inter-\nactions are similar to parasitoids in that the reproduction of the eater is dependent on the\ninteraction; however, the host is not killed. In most instances, the eatee suffers because of\na loss of nutrients, and the eater benefits because it is provided with nutrition and often\nwith protection as a result of the structure of the gall. 448 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nFFiigg.. 99 GGaallllss oonn aa ssuuggaarr mmaappllee lleeaaff..

Heterotrophs that consume material (plant, animal, fungal and others) that is\nalready dead (i.e., they did not kill it) are termed saprophytes. Because plants are contin-\nually shedding leaves and roots (and in many cases stems), these discarded items are often\nabundant and provide food for a number of organisms. The nutrient quality of these dis-\ncarded items is generally substantially below that of living tissues because the plant, in the\nprocess of senescence, recycles materials, retrieving much of the material present in the\nsoon to be discarded item before it is actually shed. Leaf protein, nucleic acid and min-\neral concentrations all decline drastically before leaves are shed and the remaining mater-\nial is much less digestible both because most of the molecules that remain (e.g., cellulose,\nlignin) are more difficult to degrade and because of the lack of nitrogen makes it hard\nto build up substantial populations of saprophytes. Organisms (especially larger ones.\ne.g., earthworms, insect larvae) feeding on dead organic material often obtain nutrition,\nperhaps most of their nutrition, from the consumption of much smaller organisms (e.g.,\nbacteria, amoebae, fungi) that are present on the decaying material and not from the\norganic material itself, i.e., they are really getting their nutrition from being predators,\nnot saprophytes. Bacteria and fungi are the most significant saprophytes in the soil but\nother groups (cellular slime molds, plasmodial slime molds and heterotrophic forms of\neuglenoids) may also be saprophytic. In aquatic systems, a significant amount of organic CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 449\nmaterial can be broken down to the point that it dissolves and is present as dissolved\norganic material, which some organisms are able to assimilate.\nCCoonnddiittiioonnss//RReessoouurrcceess IInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nAll organisms change the resources and conditions around them. The extent to which this\naffects other organisms depends on: how big the organism is (big things have more of an\neffect than small ones), how plentiful they are (i.e., their population size) and precisely\nwhat changes they bring about. Any organism is a \u2018producer,\u2019 i.e., it grows and produces\na resource (i.e., biomass) that some other organisms can eat. Therefore all organisms must\nprovide resources. Plants (and more generally autotrophs) are particularly important in a\nresource sense because, being the base of food chains, their activity represents how many\ntrophic resources are available to entire communities. Also, except for autotrophs (who\nare \u2018self-feeders\u2019) all other organisms, i.e,. heterotrophs, eat something and can influence\nother species by depleting that resource. But there are many other ways that organisms\ninteract with each other besides affecting trophic resources. Here are some examples:\nThe trees of a forest substantially change the conditions below them. Temperatures are\nmoderated (cooler in the daytime, warmer at night). Wind is moderated. Rainfall/snow-\nfall patterns are changed. For deciduous forests the annual deposit of leaves covers the\nground surface and acts like insulation, keeping the soil warmer in the fall and cooler\nin the spring. In evergreen forests, leaves layer the ground but the fact that they do not\ncome all at once alters the dynamics. Leaf litter affects soil chemistry. Thus different\nspecies can have different effects. The tipping over of a tree root system that occurs when\ntrees are blown over changes the topography and exposes lower mineral layers. And some\nspecies (e.g., yellow birch) germinate best in mineral soil because the roots of seedlings\nare unable to penetrate a blanket of leaf litter.\nOxygen consumption by organisms in terrestrial habitats generally has little impact\nbecause the oxygen levels in the air are high (~20% of the air is oxygen) and because winds\nkeep the air well-mixed and localized depletions are unlikely. In contrast, oxygen deple-\ntion in the soil and in some aquatic situations can have very significant consequences. In\nwaterlogged soil, oxygen consumption by roots, fungi and a host of soil organisms, cou-\npled with reduced oxygen movement in because of the soil\u2019s water-filled pores, can make\nthe soil anaerobic. Similarly, unless there are processes promoting mixing of the water col- 450 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\numn, respiration by heterotrophs at the bottom of the lake, where organic matter settles,\nsignificantly lowers the oxygen levels, potentially affecting all organisms living there.\nFFiigg.. 1100 RReedd bboogg mmoossss ((SSpphhaaggnnuumm ccaappiilllliiffoolliiuumm)) iiss aa ccoommmmoonn ssppeecciieess iinn bbooggss.. NNoottee\ntthhee ddeennsseellyy ppaacckkeedd sstteemmss..\nA globally significant example of organisms changing oxygen availability and conse-\nquently affecting other organisms involves Sphagnum moss and areas known as bogs.\nSphagnum moss can develop high population densities and this, coupled with their pat-\ntern of growth, creates a dense mat of stems elongat ing at the top but with an exten-\nsive layer of dead stem and \u2018leaf\u2019 material below. The stems and leaves hold substantial\nquantities of water and water is also held in the spaces between plants, producing what\nis essentially a giant sponge. This creates a habitat of stagnant water, where there is lit-\ntle mixing of the surface layer of water with the water below. C onsequently, at a very\nshallow depth, the water becomes anaerobic because of oxygen consumption by sapro-\nphytes feeding on the dead plant material. In addition, the chemistry of sphagnum cell\nwalls causes the water to become acidic. The acidic conditions, combined with lack of CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 451\noxygen, greatly reduce the decomposition of plant material, thereby reduc ing the supply\nof nutrients (remember that nutrients become available to plants because of decomposi-\ntion), and cause peat (un-decomposed plant material) to accumulate. The soil conditions\nprevent a large number of species (e.g., trees) from existing in the area or causes them to\nhave stunted growth. Instead, bogs have a characteristic group of species, often members\nof the blueberry family, that are tolerant of the soil conditions.\nOne of the types of plants found in the nutrient-poor conditions of a bog are \u2018carnivorous\u2019\nplants including pitcher plants, which nicely demonstrate the nutritional distinction\nbetween autotrophs and heterotrophs. Heterotrophs obtain both \u2018food\u2019 (a carbohydrate\nsupply for cellular respiration) and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) from the material they con-\nsume. Carnivorous plants obtain energy through photosynthesis just as most plants do,\nmaking food in photosynthesis and then eating it. The significance of their \u2018predation\u2019 is\nthat it provides carnivorous plants with nutrients (not \u2018food\u2019) that are otherwise hard to\ncome by because of the habitats where they dwell. There are a wide variety of devices for\ncapturing prey (generally insects), including pitchers, snap traps, flypaper, bladders and\nlobster traps (see more carnivorous plants at https://earthsky.org/earth/lifeform-of-the-\nweek-carnivorous-plants-are-out-for-blood).\nPitcher plants have a highly modified leaf whose petiole serves as a container for rain-\nwater. The pitcher also possesses features that attract and capture insects who eventually\ndrown there. The water develops a decomposition community of bacteria, fungi, water\nmolds, amoebae, insect larvae and others. As a result of their activity, nutrients become\navailable in a forms that the plant can absorb. In contrast, nutrients do not become avail-\nable to the roots due to the lack of decomposition in the waterlogged peat that pitcher\nplants are rooted in.\nDense growth of algal (usually cyanobacteria but sometimes green algae) can \u2018seal\u2019 the\ntop of ponds, creating a situation comparable to sphagnum bogs because the wind is not\nable to induce mixing of the oxygen-rich top layers of the water with the lower layers.\nBecause no light can penetrate the dense algal layer on top, no photosynthesis is possible\nexcept at the surface. These factors, coupled with the magnitude of dead plant material\nthat is created by the algal growth and the decomposition of this material by heterotrophs\nbelow, cause the lower water levels to become anaerobic, eventually drastically altering\nthe species present and limiting the rate of decomposition. 452 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nFFiigg.. 1111 AAnn OOnnttaarriioo bboogg..

In particular, two species requiring the same resource can affect each other by\nmaking the resource less available for other organism/species. Plants interact with other\nplants by their consumption of light, nutrients and water. This is the classic explana-\ntion for an interaction described as \u2018competition\u2019 although there are other reasons besides\nresource depletion that might explain why the presence of one species might deter the\ngrowth of another species (or at the population level, where the presence of one popula-\ntion lessens the population density of a second population).\nGlobally, two of the most important biotic consequences involving resources are the\naddition of oxygen to the atmosphere by photosynthetic organisms and the addition of\nsimple mineral forms of nutrients into the soil or aquatic systems as a result of the decom-\nposition carried out by heterotrophs. CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 453\nPlants provide resources in other ways; their physical structure is important to many\nother other species: birds nest in trees; many spiders use plant structures as a base for\ntheir webs; parts of plants and pieces of lichens are often used as building materials for\nnests.\nFFiigg.. 1122 PPllaannttss ddoonn\u2019\u2019tt jjuusstt pprroovviiddee bbuuiillddiinngg mmaatteerriiaallss ((lluummbbeerr))\nffoorr hhuummaannss,, tthheeyy pprroovviiddee tthheemm ffoorr aa wwiiddee vvaarriieettyy ooff\noorrggaanniissmmss iinncclluuddiinngg oosspprreeyy ((aabboovvee)) aanndd hhuummmmiinnggbbiirrddss\n((bbeellooww))..

For plants, the most significant of these results from organisms that provide\nmobility, mobility for male gametophytes in pollination and mobility for seeds. A nimals\ntransport seeds both \u2018passively\u2019, when seeds or fruits stick to fur, and \u2018actively\u2019 when the\nplant attracts animals to a trophic reward (generally fruits, but sometimes seeds, Fig. 14)\nwith the mobile animal then transporting the seeds and depositing them (often by defe-\ncating) some distance away.

In\nthe case of pollinators, not only are some species capable of moving pollen but they can do\nit in a very directed way, transporting it to members of the same species of plant, thereby\nallowing cross-pollination and cross-fertilization to occur. This specificity (i.e., mobility\nto a specific, favorable location) occasionally is the case for seed transport, e.g., Clark\u2019s\nnutcrackers transport seeds to sites that are particularly favorable for the growth of the\npines whose seeds they are transporting; certain ant dispersed species bring about move-\nment of seeds to sites (ant nests) that are particularly favorable for seedling establishment\n(Fig. 14). CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 455\nWhile the common interaction is a \u2018quid pro quo\u2019\nwith food provided by the plant \u2018in exchange for\u2019\nwork by the visitor, occasionally the plant is provid-\ning a non-food reward. Some orchids provide specific\nchemicals that serve as pheromones for the insects\nthat acquire them. The Yucca plant provides not only\nfood but also a shelter for larval yucca moths that\ndevelop from the eggs that the yucca moth deposits as\nit is pollinating the plant. Ficus trees provide food\nand nesting sites for pollinators.\nTwo excellent sites that consider these interactions\nare:\n\u2022 Yucca moth: https://www2.palomar.edu/users/\nwarmstrong/ww0902a.htm FFiigg.. 1144 SSeeeeddss ooff bbllooooddrroooott hhaavvee\n\u2022 Ficus: https://www2.palomar.edu/users/warm- aappppeennddaaggeess ccaalllleedd eellaaiioossoommeess\ntthhaatt aarree aappppeeaalliinngg ttoo aannttss tthhaatt\nstrong/pljune99.htm\nccoolllleecctt tthhee sseeeeddss aanndd ttaakkee tthheemm ttoo\ntthheeiirr nneesstt..\n[Both these links come from an outstanding website\n(\u2018Wayne\u2019s Word\u2019) that is an excellent source of botanical information. Take some time to\nexplore it.]\nThere are a number of examples of \u2018cheating\u2019 by both the visitor and the plant. Some vis-\nitors can consume the food reward without picking up pollen and consequently without\nproviding the plant with a service. Plants may attract visitors with visual displays but give\nthem no rewards. And, in the case of pitcher plants, the attraction may lead to the demise\nof the visitor.\n\u2018Protection rackets\u2019 describe a relationship where the plant provides food and another\nspecies does work by protecting the plant from herbivores. This relationship is particu-\nlarly well developed in some Acacia trees and shrubs where the plant not only provides\nfood rewards but also provides nesting spots for colonies of ant defenders. Additionally,\nwhile the typical food reward (for pollination, seed dispersal and defense) is nectar, a com-\npound that is cheap to produce, some Acacia species provide more complex food rewards,\nBeltian bodies, packets that are much more rewarding nutritionally because they contain\nlipids and proteins. These are much more expensive for the plant to make. An extension 456 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\nof this interaction is the three species interaction of plants, aphids and ants. Aphids are\ninsect herbivores (grazers, sometimes parasites) that tap into the plant\u2019s phloem tissue\nusing their stylet. Since phloem sap has abundant sucrose but scant amino acids, the aphid\neats a lot of phloem sap to acquire the amino acids it needs and the excess sucrose is\nexcreted as \u2018honeydew\u2019, aka \u2018frass\u2019 (insect excrement). Ants have developed a relationship\nof defending the aphids from predators while acquiring the honeydew that the aphids\nproduce.\nFFiigg.. 1155 TThhee ssmmaallll iinnsseeccttss oonn tthhee ttoopp ppaarrtt ooff tthhee lleeaaff ppeettiioollee aarree aapphhiiddss wwhhoossee ssttyylleettss hhaavvee\nppeenneettrraatteedd iinnttoo pphhllooeemm ttiissssuuee aanndd aarree hhaavviinngg pphhllooeemm ssaapp ppuummppeedd iinnttoo tthheeiirr mmoouutthh bbyy tthhee\nppllaannttss..

In nodule forming plants the\nprotected habitat are galls on the roots. The aquatic fern Azolla forms small cavities on the\nsurfaces of leaves that the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena colonize. This rela-\ntionship is utilized by rice farmers who encourage the growth of Azolla, a small aquatic\nplant that lives on the surface of bodies of water. Nitrogen fixed by the cyanobacterium\nbecomes available to the rice when the Azolla dies and is decomposed.\nA more \u2018one-sided\u2019 work interaction in volves insects acquiring and utilizing chemicals\nthat the plant synthesizes. Monarch butterflies acquire a poison from the milkweed plants\nthat they eat. The plant is grazed by the Monarch caterpillars and gains nothing, but the\ninsect acquires a chemical that deters predation. A similar situation occurs with poison CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS | 457\ndart frogs. The frogs become poisonous because of the insects that they consume, with\nyet-to-be-determined plants eaten by the insects providing the specific chemicals. Plants\ncan also be on the receiving end of defensive chemicals as is the case with some fungal\nendophytes (parasites) who produce toxins that can affect herbivores.\nIn a number of interactions the \u2018work\u2019 is the production of a particular structure (note\nthat producing any biological structure requires material and energy). For example, vines\nutilize the structure of other plants and thereby avoid the costs associated with produc-\ning structural cells (sclerenchyma fibers) that are needed to produce a rigid stem that can\nwithstand the forces of gravity and wind. Another example involving plants are what are\ncalled \u2018hemiparasites\u2019. These are plants that attach to the roots of other plants, connect-\ning to the xylem, not the phloem. Hence it is not a trophic relationship, food is not trans-\nferred from host to \u2018parasite\u2019, rather the \u2018parasite\u2019 is utilizing the structure produced by\nits host, the root system, to acquire water and minerals. These move passively from the\nhost\u2019s roots into the stem of the hemiparasite.\nAt least some of the benefits of mycorrhizal associations may involve a similar type of\nrelationship, with the fungus providing structure to explore the soil to acquire water\nand nutrients. However, in mycorrhizae the plant fosters the relationship by providing\nfood for the fungus. In endomycorrhizae (vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae) that involve\nGlomeromycota fungi, the arbuscules can be considered a type of haustorium that facili-\ntates transfer of food from the host plant to the fungus. In ectomycorrhizae there are no\narbuscules and but the plant \u2018leaks\u2019 sufficient food to sustain the fungus. In both types of\nmycorrhizae the fungus does additional \u2018work\u2019 besides simply producing structure. The\nfungi are producing enzymes that mobilize mineral elements that can be them to their\nhost.\nFinally, some of the well-known \u2018symbiotic\u2019 relationships involve structural features. One\nmight consider the role of coral animals and lichen fungi to be providing services (struc-\nture) for the dinoflagellates and algae that live inside them.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cBotany Blog \u2013 Dispersal of Trillium seeds by ants.\u201d\n\u25e6 http://botany.thismia.com/2009/09/ 458 | CHAPTER 27: BIOTIC INTERACTIONS\n\u2022 \u201cAustralian Museum \u2013 Herbivory: eating plants.\u201d\n\u25e6 https://australian.museum/learn/animals/insects/herbivory-eating-\nplants/\n\u2022 \u201cMycoloop: chytrids in aquatic food webs\u201d by Maiko Kagami.

Although there is much less agricultural activity in aquatic/marine systems,\nthere is some, and secondary effects from terrestrial activities, e.g. fertilizer run-off, also\nhas an impact. Like all interactions, agriculture involves modifications of both partners.\nAnd while we will focus on the non-human component, generally flowering plants, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that agriculture has brought about tremendous changes in\nhumans, with probably the most significant ones coming about as agriculture originated\nand humans altered their patterns of activity, movement and social interactions. It is sig-\nnificant to note that relative to the existence of humans, agriculture is a recent innova-\ntion, starting roughly 10,000 years ago. For most of their 200,000 year existence, humans\nwere not involved with agriculture, although they certainly did influence specific plants\nby their activities. It is also significant that agriculture apparently developed separately\nin multiple regions. Authorities now list eleven sites of agricultural origin, including the\nMiddle East, Africa, the Far East, and North, South and Central America. In each of CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE | 461\nthese regions distinct species were utilized. The table below lists some of the earliest crops\nalong with their region of origin:\nTable 1.\ncrops site of domestication\nwheat, peas, lentils, flax, figs, chickpeas Middle East\npotato, tomato, pepper South America\ncorn, squash, beans Mesoamerica\nbanana, sugarcane, taro New Guinea\nrice, mung beans, soy beans China\nmillet, sorghum, Africa\neggplant, mungo bean, pigeon pea India\nThe majority of crops, and certainly the crops associated with the origin of agriculture,\nwere wild plants that humans had already discovered to have desirable features (most\ncommonly features related to eating but sometimes the features were mechanical, e.g. cot-\nton, or chemical, e.g. a waterproof latex from tree bark). The next step was the appreci-\nation that the plant could yield more product if it were somehow cared for, e.g. planted,\npruned, etc. For most crops, the practice of collecting and planting seeds was crucial\nto crop development. Through time, many plant species were genetically modified by\nhumans through selection and planting of seeds from plants with particularly desirable\ntraits, e.g. large seeds. Genetic modification of agricultural organisms (Darwin called\nthis \u2018artificial selection\u2019) was most rapid when dealing with annual plants that could be\nselected for yearly. This chapter examines the histories of several crops that reveal inter-\nesting biological features. 462 | CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE\nTOPICS\n\u2022 How do crops come to be?\n\u25e6 Wheat\n\u25e6 Strawberry\n\u25e6 Naval oranges\n\u25e6 Banana\n\u25e6 Corn\n\u25e6 Brassica\n\u2022 Generating variability\nWWhheeaatt\nFFiigg.. 22 BBrreeaadd wwhheeaatt,, tthhee ttiipp ooff tthhee sstteemm hhaadd mmuullttiippllee flfloowweerrss tthhaatt nnooww hhaavvee\nddeevveellooppeedd iinnttoo ffrruuiittss..\nThe plant known as \u2018 wheat\u2019 actually includes three distinct species in the Triticum genus:\neinkhorn wheat, emmer wheat, and bread wheat. Each of these species has wild relatives CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE | 463\nthat may be considered separate species or may be lumped with the domesticated form.\nThese species are related evolutionarily in what is known as a polyploid series. Einkhorn\nhas a diploid chromosome number of 14 and produces haploid gametes with seven chro-\nmosomes. Emmer wheat has 28 chromosomes, 14 of which came from Einkhorn wheat and\n14 of which came from a related, but separate genus (Aegilops, although some workers have\nlumped Aegilops and Triticum). Bread wheat has 42 chromosomes, 28 of which come from\nemmer wheat and 14 from another species of Aegilops.\nPolyploidy is common in plants and is an aspect in the history of multiple crops. It can\ncome about several ways, the most common being a hybridization event where gametes\nof two separate species are combined. Viable gametes cannot be produced in the hybrid\nbecause meiosis is thwarted by the fact that there are no homologous chromosomes to\npair, the chromosomes from one parent do not have \u2018matches\u2019 because the second parent\nwas a different species with different chromosomes. Consequently, the hybrid is sterile;\nthis is what causes the two parents to be considered separate species, they are reproduc-\ntively isolated.\nHowever, hybrid sterility can be overcome in several different ways. One is to produce\nfunctional gametes (i.e. cells that can fuse with other cells) without going through meiosis,\ni.e. to produce \u2018unreduced gametes\u2019. If these \u2018unreduced gametes\u2019 find each other and fuse\nthen a new species is created, one that has twice the chromosome number of its either\nof its parents. In the case of emmer wheat the new species has a diploid chromosome\nnumber of 28, 14 (seven pairs) coming from einkhorn wheat and 14 (seven pairs) coming\nfrom Aegilops. Another possibility is that the cells within the hybrid replicate their chro-\nmosomes (mitosis) but the cell does not divide, leaving a cell with double the number of\nchromosomes of its parents, and significantly, producing a cell that has a match for each\nchromosome. Such a cell (or derivatives of this cell) could go through meiosis because it\ndoes have pairs of chromosomes. In both of these situations a new \u2018polyploid\u2019 species like\nemmer wheat is produced. Polyploidy is also discussed in Chapter 31.\nBread wheat was produced by the same polyploid mechanism following hybridization,\nthis time between emmer wheat and another species of Aegilops. Hence, bread wheat pos-\nsesses three genomes (sets of chromosomes), one from einkhorn wheat and two from two\ndifferent species of Aegilops. Each set consists of seven chromosomes, thus dipoid cells\nof bread wheat have 42 chromosomes, two copies of each of the three sets of chromo-\nsomes. The origin of bread wheat is quite recent, less than 10,000 years ago, and after both\neinkhorn and emmer wheat had been domesticated. 464 | CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE\nFFiigg.. 33 EEvvoolluuttiioonn ooff wwhheeaatt ((TTrriittiiccuumm)) sshhoowwiinngg ttwwoo ddiippllooiidd wwhheeaattss ((ggeennoommee AAAA)),, tthhrreeee\ntteettrraappllooiiddss ((ggeennoommee AAAABBBB)) aanndd oonnee hheexxaappllooiidd ((AAAABBBBDDDD)) aalloonngg wwiitthh tthhee aapppprrooxxiimmaattee\nddaatteess ooff oorriiggiinn..

CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE | 465\nSSttrraawwbbeerrrryy\nThe strawberries found in grocery stores have\na very interesting heritage involving Chile,\neastern North America and France. Straw-\nberry is in the genus Fragaria and there are\nover 20 species occurring primarily in temper-\nate regions of North America, Europe and the\nFar East. Most of these species have seen very\nlimited agricultural utilization but are har-\nvested in the wild. Although it has very lim-\nited commercial production, one European\nspecies, F. vesca, especially some clones with\nparticularly large fruits, has been cultivated\nfor over 500 years, primarily in parts of\nTurkey. A South American species with white\nfruits, F. chiloensis, native to the west coast of\nNorth and South America was cultivated by\nnative tribes in what is now Chile. In the early\n1800\u2019s six specimens of F. chiloensis were trans-\nported to France and propagated in several\ngardens alongside specimens of F. virginiana, a\nFFiigg.. 44 TThhee ccoommmmeerrcciiaall ssttrraawwbbeerrrryy iiss aa\nNorth American species.

It is this\nhybrid that is now widely cultivated throughout the world, generally being propagated\nthrough cuttings.\nNNaavveell oorraannggeess\nAnother crop with a \u2018chance\u2019 origin is the navel orange. It occurred as a \u2018sport\u2019, a mutant\nbranch, on an orange tree growing in Brazil. Remember that branches originate from lat-\neral buds, meristematic tissue left behind by the elongating shoot apical meristem. Occa-\nsionally, some of the lateral bud meristems possess mutations that cause them to produce 466 | CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE\na branch that grows abnormally or one that produces leaves that are unusual (a common\nmanifestation is a branch that produces variegated leaves, leaves that are not uniformly\ngreen but are colored a variety of ways). In the case of the navel orange the branch was\nunusual because its flowers, which normally occur singly, occured as pairs, with a second\nflower produced very close to the \u2018normal\u2019 flower. The proximity of the two flowers is\nmanifested in an altered fruit development, producing not two distinct fruits but rather\na single fruit with another fruit inside it. This is what produces the navel for which the\nplant is named. If one peels and opens up a navel orange, the second fruit is very evi-\ndent at navel end. This fruit does not possess a skin and is much smaller than the normal\nfruit, typically less than an inch in diameter. But, like the normal fruit, it is composed of\nwedge-shaped sections. A second abnormality of navel oranges is that the pollen is sterile\nand consequently cannot fertilize flowers. Because of this, the fruits produced by navel\noranges are seedless.\nFFiigg.. 55 NNaavveell oorraannggeess sshhoowwiinngg tthhee cchhaarraacctteerriissttiicc \u2018\u2018nnaavveell\u2019\u2019 aatt tthhee eenndd ooppppoossiittee ooff tthhee\nsstteemm tthhaatt aattttaacchheedd iitt ttoo tthhee ppllaanntt..\nNavel oranges are perpetuated by cuttings, and all the navel oranges grown world-side are\nultimately derived from to the original branch produced on the tree in Brazil. A cutting\ncan be rooted to form a naval orange tree but are more commonly cuttings are grafted\non to an existing root stock. A variety of species, generally close relatives, can be used as CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE | 467\nrootstocks and rootstocks can be selected for, and developed for, favorable characteristics,\ne.g. temperature, drought and pathogen tolerance.\nBBaannaannaa\nUnlike naval oranges which are propagated by grafting branches (called scions) on to a\nvariety of rootstocks, bananas are propagated by the cloning of whole plants, i.e. taking\na cutting, usually a branch, and having it form roots. Cloning from cuttings is much\nless \u2018technological\u2019 than grafting and the utilization of cuttings as an agricultural tech-\nnique goes back to the time when agriculture was developing. There are a large number\nof banana varieties and it is thought most appeared in the wild and were selected because\nof favorable features, in particular large fruits that lack seeds. Obviously a lack of seeds\nmakes propagation by seed impossible, but cloning allows these favorable characteristics\nbe perpetuated. Modern studies indicate that the many banana varieties are derived\nfrom two species and polyploid deriva-\ntives of these species. Most bananas grown\ncommercially are triploid, with a genetic\nconstitution of AAB meaning that they\npossess two chromosome sets of one type\nand one chromosome set from another.\nSuch a triploid may be the result of a\ntetraploid (AAAA, that produces gametes\nthat are AA) hybridizing with a (normal)\ndiploid (BB, that produces gametes that\nare B). The offspring of this cross are ster-\nile because meiosis is impossible, but\ncloning allows the plant to be perpetu-\nated. Moreover, the sterility brought\nabout by hybridization has created a\nfavorable feature \u2014 no seeds. Triploids\nmay also arise by the the union of an unre-\nFFiigg.. 66..

The offspring is triploid, AAB, and sterile. 468 | CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE\nFor most plant species the production of fruits is a consequence of the production of\nseeds, with the initiation of seed development triggering the initiation of fruit develop-\nment. The production of fruits when seeds are not developing at all, or when seeds are\ninitiated but soon aborted, is called parthenocarpy. It is generally considered to be evo-\nlutionarily unfavorable since the basic function of fruits is to promote seed dispersal and\nproducing fruits without seeds is a waste of resources. Parthenocarpy can appear \u2018sponta-\nneously\u2019, but it generally will not be perpetuated, unless of course it is selected by (early)\nagriculturalists. More recently, parthenocarpy may be developed in breeding programs.\nAn example is the seedless watermelon, which, like most bananas, is a sterile triploid,\nbut it was produced by plant breeders crossing a tetraploid plant with a (normal) diploid\nplant. Seedless watermelons do have seeds but they are small and not fully developed.\nSeedless watermelons do require pollination to initiate the seeds but they soon abort. In\nsome crops (e.g. some varieties of tomato) parthenocarpic varieties produce fruits even if\npollination is lacking.\nCCoorrnn\nFFiigg.. 77 TTeeoossiinnttee,, tthhee aanncceessttoorr ooff ccoorrnn,, ccoommppaarreedd ttoo ccoorrnn.. CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE | 469\nCorn\u2019s origin as a crop has been a mystery because there had been no obvious ancestor,\ni.e. a species that looks like corn and could be considered to be something that primitive\nagriculturalists might manipulate to produce the entity that we know as corn. Research\nover the last 75 years has revealed that there is a close relative, called teosinte, but its prox-\nimity to corn is obscured by the fact that it \u2018looks\u2019, i.e. has a morphology, that is substan-\ntially different from corn. Studies have revealed that corn and teosinte are actually the\nsame species \u2014 they readily interbreed. The morphological difference between the two\nare actually the result of changes in only a few (less than 10) genes. It is now thought that\nselection on teosinte developed the variety (subspecies) that we now consider to be corn,\na plant that unlike teosinte: does not branch, has much larger \u2018ears\u2019 (clusters of female\nflowers), and has seeds that are not enclosed in a rigid container but are relatively easily\nremoved, allowing easier access to an edible structure.\nCorn was responsible for dramatic changes in agriculture, in particular the development\nof seed companies, commercial entities that provide seed to individual farmers. Up until\nearly in the 20th century most farmers provided seeds for themselves by storing seed from\nthe previous crop. When storing seed for the next year\u2019s crop, most farmers, passively or\nactively, selected for increased yield by saving seed from plants that were disease resistant,\npest resistant and generally higher yielding. Early in the 20th century agriculture changed\ndrastically in a number of ways, one of them being that farmers started to purchase seed\nfrom companies because they could provide seed that was better than what farmers had\non hand. This better seed was the result of agricultural research occurring both in \u2018land\ngrant colleges\u2019 (who were charged with improving agriculture) and also in private compa-\nnies when it was realized that that money could be made by supplying seeds to farmers.\nCorn was instrumental to this process because it is amenable to producing what is known\nas \u2018hybrid seed\u2019, discussed further in Chapter 31. 470 | CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE\nTThhee aammaazziinngg BBrraassssiiccaa ggrroouupp\nPlants in the genus Brassica reflect a wide\nvariety of interesting topics that intersect\nagriculture and biology.\nBrassica is a genus in the mustard family\nthat has a long history of cultivation and\nmanipulation that has allowed the group\nto be widely utilized in numerous forms.\nBelow is a partial list of cultivated plants\nin the Brassica genus, along with their\nuses::\nFFiigg.. 88 KKoohhllrraabbii,, aa vvaarriieettyy ooff BBrraassssiiccaa oolleerraacceeaa\ntthhaatt hhaass aa vveerryy tthhiicckkeenneedd sstteemm,, wwhhiicchh iiss tthhee\n\u2022 white mustard (spice) (Brassica hirta ppaarrtt tthhaatt iiss eeaatteenn..\naka Sinapsis alba)\n\u2022 black mustard (spice) (Brassica nigra)\n\u2022 rapeseed (Brassica napus)\u2014grown for oil and animal feed\n\u2022 canola oil (varieties of Brassica rapa and B. napus) \u2014 grown for oil and animal feed\n\u2022 leaf mustard, brown mustard (Brassica juncea) \u2014grown as a vegetable\n\u2022 Ethiopian mustard, Ethiopian rape (Brassica carinata)\u2014grown as a vegetable\n\u2022 bok choy, rapini (aka brocoli rabe), turnip, napa cabbage (Brassica rapa)\u2014 grown as\nvegetables\n\u2022 cabbage, kale, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kohlabi (Brassica oleoraca) \u2014\ngrown as vegetables\n\u2022 rutabaga (Brassica napus) \u2014 grown as vegetable\nAs was the case with wheat, polyploidy is significant in the relationships of these crops.\nThe crops come from three diploid species, (B. nigra, oleracea and rapa), and three poly-\nploid (tetraploid) derivatives, B. carinate, juncea, and napus), produced from hybridization\nwith pairs of the three diploids.\nAnother similarity to wheat, and to several other crops (e.g. sunflower) is that these\nspecies are \u2018weedy\u2019 (see Chapter 29), i.e. they thrive in \u2018ruderal\u2019 (disturbed) habitats.\nHence the progenitors of most of these crops probably grew in the disturbed habitats that\nancestral humans created by their behavior. Domestication followed from this. In fact, CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE | 471\nFFiigg.. 99.. RReellaattiioonnsshhiippss iinn tthhee ggeennuuss BBrraassssiiccaa..\nwhile black mustard is grown as a crop, it is also a significant weed in many parts of the\nworld.\nUnlike wheat, a polyploid group whose members all look very similar, the Brassica group\nshows remarkable morphological variation, especially the ones used as vegetables, where\nthe edible part may be leaves (kale, collard greens, leaf mustard, Ethiopian mustard), roots\n(turnips, rutabagas), enlarged stems (kohlrabi), shortened stems with overlapping leaves\n(cabbage, see Chapter 10), lateral buds (brussel sprouts, see Chapter 10), and thickened\ninflorescence meristems (cauliflower, broccoli). 472 | CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE\nAll of these crops were developed thousands of years ago by selection for plants that had\nfavorable traits; i.e., \u2018primitive\u2019 agriculturalists noted favorable features and perpetuated\nplants that had these features. A challenge to these early genetic engineers is that most\nof these crops are biennials, meaning that some of the crop must be allowed to overwin-\nter and in the second year transform into a flowering form from which the seeds are col-\nlected, i.e. these farmers needed to be aware that flowers and seeds are only available in\nthe second summer after planting.\nAnother interesting feature of these plants is their chemistry. They produce a group of\nchemicals called glucosinolates, that, if cells are ruptured, are converted into chemicals\ncalled isothiocyanates. It is these chemicals that give members of this group (also closely\nrelated radish, horseradish and wasabi) a peppery and sometimes \u2018hot\u2019 taste. Glucosi-\nnolates release isothiocyanates as a result of the action of the enzyme myrosinase. This\nenzyme is sequestered separate from the glucosinolates, and only acts to release isothio-\ncyanates when herbivory is occurring, crushing cells and breaking open cellular compo-\nnents, thereby allowing myrosinase to be in contact with glucosinolates. Although many\nhumans find isothiocyanates desirable, many insects do not and the system acts as a chem-\nical deterrent to herbivory (although, as is often the case, some insects specialize on mus-\ntards and are attracted by the chemistry). A comparable sequestering system operates\nin some plants (e.g. apple seeds) where cyanogenic glycosides are stored separate from\nenzymes that can cleave a sugar group to release cyanide.\nGGeenneerraattiinngg vvaarriiaabbiilliittyy\nWhether or not one is utilizing hybrids, crop development requires variability followed\nby selection of plants with favorable features. Open pollinated crops generate variability\nboth through naturally occurring mutations and also by chance shuffling of genes in the\nsexual process. Although there had been suspicions on the existence of sex in plants and\nthe roles of pollen and pollination, the observations of Rudolf Cameraius late in the 17th\ncentury revealed the role of pollen and made possible the generation of variability by the\nintentional crossing of two related species. Often these efforts were stimulated by the\nbotanical explorations and the collection of \u2018new\u2019 plants, e.g. the production of commer-\ncial strawberries described above. This allowed closely related plants to be grown together\nand crossed. Early in the 20th century, workers discovered that they could generate vari-\nability with treatments that induce mutations: specific toxic chemicals or harsh radiation.\nAnd most recently, modern molecular techniques allow for the most precise modifica- CHAPTER 28: AGRICULTURE | 473\ntions of plant characteristics through the introduction, or occasionally removal, of spe-\ncific genes. Although the later process is the only one described as \u2018genetic modification\u2019,\none should appreciate that crops have been genetically modified once they started to be\ncultivated. One should also appreciate that modern techniques are by far the most spe-\ncific, meaning that the modifications are the most targeted, with the least amount of dis-\nruption of non-target genes and features (see Chapter 31).\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cA Brief History of the Seed Industry\u201d by SeedStory.\n\u25e6 https://seedstory.wordpress.com/a-brief-history-of-the-seed-indus-\ntry/\n\u2022 \u201cDate update: Methuselah gets six siblings\u201d by The History blog.

Ecological weeds can colonize and quickly dominate a disturbed 476 | CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL\nsite but may not persist because they often are unable to compete with other species that\neventually arrive at the site.\nBut \u2018weed\u2019 is not used just by ecologists and its definition is both utilitarian and subjec-\ntive:\n\u2018A plant that interferes with the management objectives at a particular location. It\nis a plant growing where it is not wanted. Under certain situations, the plant may\nnot be totally undesirable.\u2019\nThis definition focuses on plants but undesirable organisms come from the entire spec-\ntrum of life, including the non-plant organisms considered in this book: cyanobacteria,\ngreen algae, red algae, diatoms, dinoflagellates and fungi.\nWeeds are \u2018pests\u2019, organisms that are undesirable for reasons that are specific to a partic-\nular situation and, as noted above, their undesirable nature depends upon situation.\n\u2022 honeybees are pests when they nest in houses or perhaps when they outcompete\nnative bee species\n\u2022 earthworms are desirable in agricultural situations but are weeds in native habitats\nwhere they can alter conditions and disrupt the native community\n\u2022 dandelions are weeds in lawns, where some consider them unsightly, but are useful\nto pollinators and to foragers who eat their leaves and flowers\n\u2022 sandbur is highly undesirable on beaches because of its sharp fruits that are painful\nto step on and stick to clothing\n\u2022 dyer\u2019s woad clearly is (was) useful as a source of dye but if one is managing land for\nother purposes then it is a weed\n\u2022 weeping willow trees are desirable as ornamentals but their roots can clog drainage\nsystems\n\u2022 the nitrogen fixing bacterium Rhizobium is desirable if it invades plant roots in\nhabitats where nitrogen is relatively scarce. When nitrogen is abundant Rhizobium\nmay actually decrease plant growth because they are being fed by the plant\nThe last example highlights the fact that there is some overlap between \u2018weeds\u2019 and \u2018dis-\nease\u2019, something that will be considered in the next chapter. CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL | 477\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Features of weeds\n\u2022 Controlling weeds\nFeatures of weeds\nAs mentioned above, weedy plants typi-\ncally grow fast and reproduce both rapidly\nand abundantly. But given the flexible and\nutilitarian definition of weed a key feature\nof weeds is that they must have character-\nistics that someone might consider unde-\nsirable. Here are some examples:\n\u2022 dandelions interrupt the smooth\ncontinuous texture of a lawn giving\nwhat some consider a an undesirable\nlook.\n\u2022 sandbur produces fruits that are\nvery painful to step on or get caught\nin a stocking FFiigg.. 22 SSaannddbbuurr iiss aa ggrraassss wwhhoossee ffrruuiittss hhaavvee\nvveerryy sshhaarrpp ppooiinnttss..\n\u2022 burdock, beggar\u2019s tickseed, stickseed\nand many others produce fruits that stick on clothing\n\u2022 box-elder trees produce an unappealing form that readily sheds branches. Its abun-\ndant fruits clog gutters\n\u2022 poison ivy, wild parsnip, giant hogweed, St. Johnswort are toxic to many humans 478 | CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL\nThe foremost undesirable feature of agri-\ncultural weeds is that their presence in\ncropland deters the growth of whatever\ncrops are being grown, an interaction that\ngenerally would be labelled competition, a\nconcept that is easy to cite but is often\nmuch more difficult to pin down. The\nbasic idea is that if two species utilize the\nsame resources (water, light, nutrients)\nthen the presence of of a competitor can\nreduce the availability of these resources\nFFiigg.. 33 PPooiissoonn iivvyy,, nnaattiivvee ttoo NNoorrtthh AAmmeerriiccaa,, iiss\nhhiigghhllyy uunnddeessiirraabbllee bbeeccaauussee iitt pprroodduucceess aa and thereby diminish the growth of the\ncchheemmiiccaall tthhaatt iiss aa sskkiinn iirrrriittaanntt..\ncrop. The phenomenon of decreased crop\ngrowth when in the presence of weeds is\nwell established, but the exact mechanism is elusive and certainly may vary between dif-\nferent weeds. Note that the best competitor for any particular crop plant is another indi-\nvidual of the same type, because it requires the same resources and acquires them in the\nsame manner. Thus intraspecific competition (between individuals of the same species)\nmay be hard to separate from interspecific competition (crop vs. weed). Keeping track of\nresources is often challenging and other interactions might account for the pattern. C\nompetition could be due to factors such as allelopathy (the weed produces chemicals that\ndeter the growth of the crop) or perhaps because the weed attracts insect pests/disease\norganisms that may affect the crop. For these reasons competition is often defined with-\nout the specific requirement of resource depletion. Most agricultural weeds are plants that\ndeter the growth of crop species for undetermined reasons.\nWhat might make a particular plant likely to be an agricultural weed? Here there is large\noverlap with characteristics of ecological weeds:\n\u2022 weeds seeds germinate readily with few or no specific germination requirements\n\u2022 weeds grow quickly and since resource acquisition is strongly tied to plant size,\ngrowing quickly allows weeds to be very effective competitors\n\u2022 weeds readily reproduce, allowing for their perpetuation on a site and producing a\nsubstantial \u2018seed bank\u2019 of seeds in the soil. Although most of their seeds germinate\nreadily, not all do, and some seeds remain viable for tens of years, meaning that\nungerminated weed seeds remain in the soil for prolonged time periods CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL | 479\nWhile the above apply to annual weeds,\nthere are also perennial weeds which\nreproduce readily from fragmented roots\nwhich may be produced by tilling. Why\ntill? because most crops are annuals and\nthey would have a very hard time compet-\ning against already established plants. But\nnote that tilling \u2018plays into the weed\u2019s\nstrength\u2019: it is a form of disturbance which\nis generally something that weeds require.\nFFiigg.. 44 DDyyeerr\u2019\u2019ss wwooaadd wwaass iinnttrroodduucceedd ttoo eeaasstteerrnn\nThe characteristics listed above also\nNNoorrtthh AAmmeerriiccaa iinn ccoolloonniiaall ttiimmeess..

Indeed, several\ncrops are thought to have been domesti-\ncated from weeds (e.g. wheat, sunflower, barley, carrot).\nAnother feature that is commonly associated with weeds is that they are non-native, i.e.\nthey were introduced into an area where they previously had not be present, generally\nbecause of human activity (both intentional and unintentional). While some would con-\nsider any non-native to be a weed, most would require that the introduced species must\nbe invasive, i.e. spreading from where it was introduced. Many introduced species are\ninvasive and this is generally attributed to the fact that \u2018natural controls\u2019 (herbivores,\ndisease) are not simultaneously introduced with the weed. While this certainly explains\nthe invasive nature of some introductions, other factors come into play. Dyer\u2019s woad was\nintroduced in the eastern U.S. and showed only a modest invasive nature as it spread\nwestward and was restricted to repeatedly disturbed sites like the sides of roads and\ntrain tracks. Arriving in California and Utah in contaminated alfalfa seed, its behavior\nchanged substantially, becoming much more invasive and entering habitats that are much\nless disturbed, replacing native plants. Part of this behavior is probably due to the fact\nthat woad\u2019s native habitat is much more similar to the arid west than to the more mesic\neastern and central part of the country. 480 | CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL\nAn interesting invasive pattern is shown by black\nlocust, a tree native to central and southeastern U.S.\nbut not to the northeast. After it was intentionally\nintroduced to the northeast it has become invasive as\nit has in several other parts of North America. What\nhad limited its spread previously is unknown. Again\nappreciating that what a weed is is subjective, black\nlocust might be considered a weed in the northeast\nbut not in the areas where it is native.\nAnother interesting pattern is seen in Phragmites aus-\ntralis, \u2018common reed grass\u2019. Apparently a variety of\nthis species was native to North America and was\npresent when European\u2019s arrived. This native variety\nFFiigg.. 55 IInnddiiggoo ddyyee ddeerriivveedd ffrroomm tthhee\nof the species is not invasive and does not form large\nffrruuiitt ooff DDyyeerr\u2019\u2019ss wwooaadd..

The two varieties (non-invasive North Ameri-\ncan; invasive European) are very closely related (same species) and very difficult to distin-\nguish. Apparently minor genetic changes can be responsible for invasive behavior.\nHowever, lots of weeds are \u2018natives\u2019 (ragweed, giant ragweed, sunflower, Jerusalem arti-\nchoke, milkweed, New England Aster, goldenrod) and most of these have not invaded new\nhabitats but have continued to occur in the disturbed habitats found in any particular\nregion.\nWeed control\nIn most situations weeds cannot be permanently eliminated but their populations may\nbe controlled using three approaches: (1) chemical control, using pesticides (herbicides)\nto kill the weed (2) biological control, using biological agents (pathogens, herbivores) to\nreduce weed populations and (3) cultural control, modifying how the land is maintained\nin order to reduce weed populations.

The basic idea is simple: find some chemical that kills weeds. The diffi-\nculty is that most chemicals that kill weeds are non-selective, i.e. they don\u2019t just kill weeds,\nthey kill all or most plants, including those whose growth you are trying to promote. A\nwide variety of herbicides have been developed but the three below are widely used and\nshow a degree of selectivity. Therefore can be used in some situations without damaging\nthe plants/crops one is trying to grow.\n2,4 D (2,4, dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is the oldest widely used herbicide. Its dis-\ncovery as a useful product, a weed killer, was the result of \u2018basic\u2019 research, i.e.\nresearch that was not focused on utility (developing a weed killer) but rather\nresearch that simply involved developing an understand of the natural world. In 482 | CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL\nthis case, workers were studying the effects of auxin, the first chemically identi-\nfied plant hormone, originally studied by Darwin one hundred years earlier. The\nonly naturally occurring auxin is indoleacetic acid, but early in the 1940\u2019s work-\ners discovered a number of chemicals, with structures similar to indoleacetic acid,\nthat could produce similar effects on plant growth and development. One of these\nartificial auxins was 2,4 D. It was up to Dr. Franklin D. Jones to do some \u2018applied\u2019\nscience, i.e. apply basic research to a practical problem. Dr. Jones was looking for\nsomething to kill the poison ivy that was plaguing his children. He tried 2,4 D and\nfound it was very effective in killing poison ivy. Significantly, 2,4 D is selective: it\nkills most broadleaf plants (dicots) but spares \u2018narrow-leaved\u2019 plants, grasses and\nsimilar species. Because this selectivity matches what one might look for eliminat-\ning lawn weeds and weeds of cereal grains (e.g. corn, wheat), 2-4 D has proved to\nbe highly useful.\nRoundup (glyphosate) was developed in the 1970\u2019s and is the most widely used\nherbicide both in agricultural situations and in home/garden situations. It is not\nat all selective, basically killing whatever plants to which it is applied. It is also a\nsystemic herbicide, meaning that if it is applied to the leaves it can be transported\nto the roots and rhizomes and can kill them too. Selectivity has been developed\nbecause resistance to Roundup, using genes from bacteria, has been genetically\nengineered (i.e. gene transfer) into several crop species, first soybeans (\u2018Roundup\nReady Soybeans), and later to corn and cotton. Fields with these specific crops can\nbe treated with Roundup to kill all other plants.\nAtrazine is the second most used herbicide in the U.S., but mostly in agricultural\nsituations and less in residential situations. It is selective, killing most broadleaf\nspecies and many weedy grasses, but being tolerated by several crop species:\ncorn, sorghum, and sugar cane (all are grasses). Additionally, an atrazine resistant\n(GMO) canola variety has been developed as well.\nConcerns about herbicides abound and include: human health concerns, ecological con-\ncerns and concerns about the development of herbicide resistant \u2018superweeds\u2019. Both\nRoundup and Atrazine have been used extensively enough that there are new varieties of\nweeds that are unaffected by these chemicals, comparable to the evolution of antibiotic\nresistant bacteria. CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL | 483\nBiological control\nBiological control involves the use of other organisms to deter the growth of weeds. In\ngeneral, this type of control is developed for introduced, invasive species of weeds. A\nsearch is made for herbivores or pathogens (see Chapter 30 on disease) that are native\nto where the introduction came from but are not present in the region that they have\ninvaded. Care must be taken to avoid introducing species that might be harmful to exist-\ning native species. This is more likely if the biocontrol agents selected are \u2018specialists\u2019 in\ntheir feeding habits. Purple loosestrife is an example of an invasive weed that has been\ncontrolled (not eliminated) by introductions of insect herbivores, beetles and weevils that\nspecialize on purple loosestrife. These species are common in purple loosestrife\u2019s native\nhabitat (Europe and Asia) but were not introduced to North America when purple looses-\ntrife was.\nCultural control\nBy definition weeds are always a problem, at least a problem for someone. Although weeds\ncan be an \u2018issue\u2019 in native habitats, the vast majority of weed problems involve humans\n(gardeners, farmers) trying to raise specific plants, i.e. trying to \u2018culture\u2019 plants that are\nsomehow desirable. The cultural practices that are followed can influence the magnitude\nof the weed problem. The choice of crops, the timing of planting, the seeding density, the\ndistance between rows, the number of sequential seasons that a crop is planted, all are\ncultural practices that may influence the severity of weed problems. Because most crops\nare annuals, they need to be planted each year, and planting involves disturbance, thereby\nencouraging weed growth. Indeed, some early 19th century farmers considered early ver-\nsions of the plough to be \u2018poisoning the soil\u2019 and promoting weed growth. Appreciating\nthat farmers are in a catch-22 condition, they need disturbance but disturbance promotes\nweed problems, there are cultural practices that can lessen the problem: such as the tim-\ning of the ploughing and how intensive the ploughing is. A modern technique called \u2018no-\ntill\u2019 farming utilizes minimal tilling, thereby giving weeds less area to utilize. Moreover,\nthe area that is available is seeded with a crop that may out-compete the weeds. Peren-\nnial non-woody crops such as alfalfa, asparagus, strawberries, raspberries require different\ncultural practices that might include items like mulching, mowing, tilling or the inten-\ntional planting of understory plants that might suppress weedy growth. This is also true\nfor woody perennial crops like grapes and apples. Cultural practices vary widely depend-\ning on the crop and its characteristics. For instance flooding is an effective means of weed 484 | CHAPTER 29: WEEDS AND WEED CONTROL\ncontrol but can only be utilized if crops, e.g. rice, tolerate the flooding. Fire can be used\nfor annual crops and for woody (tree) crops if it is a low intensity surface fire.\nFFiigg.. 77 NNoo ttiillll ffaarrmmiinngg:: IInnsstteeaadd ooff pplloouugghhiinngg tthhee eennttiirree fifieelldd,, aa nnaarrrrooww ttrreenncchh iiss\n\u2018\u2018ddrriilllleedd\u2019\u2019 wwhheerree tthhee sseeeedd iiss ppllaanntteedd..

Some of these\nhave been covered in earlier chapters: extremes in temperature and moisture (Chapter\n26); and interactions with other plants, i.e. weeds (Chapter 29). A large number of addi-\ntional threats come from trophic interactions with a vast diversity of grazers, parasites\nand and predators. Certainly the most familiar of these are insects but other inverte-\nbrates (mites, nematodes, mollusks) and vertebrates can be significant obstacles to grow-\ning plants. Moreover, a large number of fungi, bacteria (Fig. 1) , protists and viruses are\nalso be important threats.

However, a\nsubstantial number of insect herbivores have feeding stages (generally larvae, e.g. leaf min-\ners, emerald ash borers, larval potato beetles) that are immobile to the extent of getting\nto new host plants. These might better be considered parasites because they feed solely on\none host plant. Most non-animal herbivores (fungi, bacteria) are basically immobile and\nare considered parasites although some are capable of grow ing from one host to another\nand many are transported from one plant to another by wind, rain and insects.\nMost grazers on plants are ingesters (see Chapter 27), they remove and consume part of\nthe plant, shred it to some extent and then digest the pieces in an internal tube, and 488 | CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS\nFFiigg.. 22 JJaappaanneessee bbeeeettlleess oonn ppeeaacchh lleeaavveess,, aann eexxaammppllee ooff aa ggrraazziinngg iinnsseecctt ppeesstt..\nultimately excrete undigestible to their environment. Grazers, although they can severely\nreduce crop yields, rarely completely kill the plant it is eating both because they tend to\nspecialize on only part of the plant (most commonly leaves) and because the plant is capa-\nble of replacing the organs/parts of organs that have been lost.\nThe plant material acquired by grazers is generally not very nutrient dense but varies\nsubstantially depending upon the part of the plant eaten. Nutritional quality is largely\ninfluenced by how many living cells are present (dead cells are basically all cell walls and\nare indigestible for most herbivores). Most herbivores specialize on one of the tissues\nlisted below, but there are some generalists that feed on multiple tissues, e.g. browsers like\nmoose and deer often eat stems, leaves and meristems.\n\u2022 primary growth of stems and roots \u2014 although stems and roots in primary growth\nhave more living cells than those with secondary growth, they still are nutrient\npoor. Most of those cells that are living are not very metabolically active and conse-\nquently they are poorer in nutrients when compared to cells that are more metabol-\nically active (e.g. leaf mesophyll cells). CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS | 489\n\u2022 woody stems and roots, heartwood: Heartwood has no living cells and has increased\nlevels of secondary chemicals. It generally has the lowest nutritional quality of any\nplant tissue. Nonetheless, there are heartwood specialists.\n\u2022 woody stems and roots, sapwood: Sapwood has some living cells (the rays) and these\nmay be \u2018loaded\u2019 with starch and other nutrients, depending on the season. Hence\nsapwood is considerable more nutritious than heartwood but still is largely com-\nposed of cell wall material.\n\u2022 woody stems and roots, vascular cambium \u2014 this meristematic tissue is nutrient\nrich and has relatively less cell wall material compared to mature cells. Moreover, it\nis more extensive than apical meristems, i.e. there is more material available to eat.\n\u2022 the bark tissue of woody stems is nutrient poor with few living cells and an abun-\ndance of secondary chemicals. The portion of cells that are living decreases as the\nstem/root ages and hence bark of younger stems is more nutritious than the bark of\nolder stems.\n\u2022 stems and roots that have been modified as storage structures \u2014 rhizomes, corms,\nbulbs, stolons. These are composed of living cells that are storing carbohydrates,\nusually in the form of starch. They are rich in digestible carbohydrates but may be\ndeficient in amino acids (proteins) and other nutrients.\n\u2022 phloem feeders: These organisms (including aphids, leaf hoppers, mealy bugs and\nwhite flies, all significant agriculture pests) are not consuming any cells, but instead\ntap into the phloem transport system and acquire the materials that are being\ntransported through it. Phloem sap has very high concentrations of sucrose along\nwith much smaller concentrations of amino acids and some minerals. Because the\nratio of carbohydrates to amino acids in phloem sap is so high most phloem feeders\nexcrete \u2018honeydew\u2019, essentially phloem sap \u2014 still rich in carbohydrates but with\nmost of the amino acids removed. Honeydew is utilized by several other organisms,\nin particular some ant species and the sooty mold fungus.\n\u2022 xylem feeders: Xylem sap has very few nutrients, almost no carbohydrates but with\nsome of mineral ions. Also, while phloem feeders acquire sap passively because it is\nunder pressure inside the phloem cells, xylem sap is under tension and requires\n\u2018sucking\u2019 (developing greater tensions than already present) in order for it to flow\ninto xylem feeders. Nonetheless, there are some insects (larval cicadas, larval spittle-\nbugs) that feed on xylem. 490 | CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS\nFFiigg.. 33 EEmmeerraalldd AAsshh bboorreerr llaarrvvaaee oonnllyy eeaatt tthhee aasshh ttrreeee tthhaatt tthhee aadduulltt hhaass cchhoosseenn ttoo llaayy\naann eegggg iinn..\nAAbbssoorrbbiinngg hheerrbbiivvoorreess\nIn contrast to grazers, most non-animal plant herbivores are absorbers (see Chapter 27),\nabsorbing nutrients from \u2018their environment\u2019, with \u2018their environment\u2019 being the interior\nof a plant. Most of these organisms are bacteria and fungi, but some, like water molds,\nare protists and a few are animals (e.g. nematodes, the larval stages of some insects).\nMost of these organisms are considered parasites and are generally considered to be plant\npathogens. They invade plant tissues and then acquire materials in one of three ways: (1)\nthe parasite feeds on materials that \u2018leak\u2019 from host cells. (2) the parasite kills host cells,\ncausing cellular materials to become available. Organisms that feed this way are described\nas being necrotrophic (feeding off dead material). (3) the parasite and host form a struc-\nture called an haustorium, a fusion of both the host cell membrane and the parasite cell\nmembrane. (Note that the development of the haustorium generally requires breakdown\nof the cell walls of both the host and parasite). Materials are transferred from host to\nparasite through the haustorium and both host and parasite stay alive. Organisms that CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS | 491\nfeed this way are described as being biotrophic (i.e. feeding off living material). Some\nbiotrophs are relatively benign herbivores (they benefit from keeping their host alive),\nand consequently many acquire relatively small amounts of resources from their hosts. But\nmany biotrophs (e.g. rusts, smuts, downy mildew, powdery mildew) can be devastating to\nfarmers as infestations often can reduce plant yields to next to nothing.\nFFiigg.. 44 DDoowwnnyy mmiillddeeww ((oooommyycceettee)) hhyypphhaaee wwiinnddiinngg iinntteerrcceelllluullaarrllyy bbeettwweeeenn ppllaanntt cceellllss wwiitthh\nhhaauussttoorriiaa ((cciirrccuullaarr ssttrruuccttuurreess)) ppeenneettrraattiinngg iinnttrraacceelllluullaarrllyy..\nPPllaanntt ddeeffeennsseess\nAn effective boundary: Except for large grazing animals, organisms need to get inside\nplant tissues in order to feed on the plant. The boundary makes this difficult by producing\na surface that is hard to penetrate and inhospitable for life (see Chapter 3). For above\nground primary growth, the boundary consists of epidermal cells that are tightly bound to\neach other, making it difficult to penetrate between cells. Additionally, above ground pri-\nmary growth is coated with a cuticle that is difficult to pierce and hard to live on because\nit is hydrophobic. Below ground, mature primary roots have an endodermis that serves\nmany of the same functions as the epidermis+cuticle does above ground. However, the\nyoungest parts of roots have not developed an endodermis. This makes water acquisition\neasier but it also makes it easier for pathogens to enter. 492 | CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS\nPathogens/herbivores gain entry both by utilizing stomatal openings and also by having\nmouthparts that can penetrate the cuticle/epidermis; or having a needle-like or saw \u2013 like\novipositer (egg-laying organ); or, in the case of some fungi, producing an appressorium, a\nspecialized cell type that is able to fuse with the epidermis and produce a structure that\ncan penetrate it. Pathogens and herbivores also gain entry through wounds and openings\nin the epidermis as the result of growth processes, e.g. branch roots and the shedding of\nleaves and branches.\nChemistry: All plants produce diverse chemicals that influence herbivory and pathogens.\nSome are feeding deterrent chemicals that are poisonous or may advertise that poisons\nare present within the plant. At the same time, some chemicals produced by plants clearly\nattract certain herbivores. The assumption is that these chemicals had once served as feed-\ning deterrents but that the herbivore has developed means to detoxify the poison and\nis now using the chemical to identify a host that relatively few competitors will be able\nto utilize. For example most insect herbivores will not eat milkweed but several insects\n(monarch butterfly larvae, the milkweed beetle and milkweed bugs) choose to feed on\nmilkweed. Some even utilize the plant\u2019s poisons as their own, making them less likely to\nbe consumed.\nPlants also produce chemicals because they recognize that they are under attack. The pro-\nduction of these \u2018induced\u2019 chemicals imply that the plant has an ability to sense the pres-\nence of the pathogen and the chemicals produced may: (1) kill the invader (phytoalexins),\n(2) trigger defensive responses in neighboring plants and/or attract predators that may\ncontrol the herbivore, or (3) elicit an \u2018hypersensitive response\u2019, causing the invaded tis-\nsue to rapidly die. Note that the hypersensitive response may be effective in deterring\nbiotrophic pathogens but actually benefits necrotrophic pathogens.\nPhenology: Plants (and farmers) may be able to avoid herbivores/predators by adjusting\nthe timing of seed germination, growth and flower / fruit production.

The plant in the wild and the\nplant that was originally propagated as an ornamental plant was much taller plant. It\nalso produced relatively few \u2018flowers\u2019 (the structures that look like a flower are actually a\ncluster of flowers surrounded by colorful, usually red, bracts). Early in the 20th century a\nplant with a novel form appeared, one that was much shorter, branched much more fre-\nquently, and produced more flowers. This form could be propagated by cuttings and the\nassumption was that the original smaller plant was a mutant, a \u2018sport\u2019, like the original\nnaval orange (see Chapter 28). Sports generally cannot be perpetuated by seed because the\nmutations making them distinctive are often recessive. But they often can be perpetuated\nby cuttings because cuttings are essentially continued growth of the original plant. There\nare other phenomena besides mutations that might account for an altered growth pattern\nthat can be perpetuated by cuttings. Two possibilities are viruses and phytoplasmas (small\nbacteria lacking cell walls that live only in plant cells). Note that all three possibilities for\nthe abnormal plant (mutation, viral infection phytoplasma infection) could be described\nas \u2018plant disease\u2019 but that what is unusual is that in this case the diseased plant is desirable\nnot undesirable. It turns out that almost all the poinsettia produced today are diseased!\nAnd the culprit turns out to be a phytoplasma.\nSo what is plant disease? In the poinsettia discussion it was associated with \u2018abnormal\nplants\u2019 A difficulty with this definition is that it is \u2018normal\u2019 for biological entities to be\n\u2018abnormal\u2019. That is, if you look at a population (group of organisms) they aren\u2019t all alike,\nthey vary, some are \u2018outside the norm\u2019. Additionally, \u2018normal\u2019 is not readily defined. It\ncan be defined statistically as a central tendency, e.g. abnormal is more than one standard\ndeviation from the mean. Although not perfect, the \u2018abnormal\u2019 definition works with\nplants partly because the most plants under consideration are typically those of economic\nimportance and \u2018normal\u2019 is a type of plant that provides the most economic return. Addi-\ntionally, most crops have been bred to be uniform.\nThus a diseased plant is recognized by abnormal structure or functioning. Common\nsymptoms of diseased plants include stunted or deformed growth and yellowed 494 | CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS\nFFiigg.. 55 AA ddiisseeaasseedd ppllaanntt????

But occasionally one might find a diseased plant that\nis \u2018bigger than normal\u2019, that branches more than normal, or that has leaves that persist\non the plant longer than normal. In an arbitrary manner, plant disease generally excludes\nconditions due to insect herbivores even though they may result in similar effects as \u2018true\u2019\nplant pathogens. Since this book is dealing with inanimate life we will not consider insect\nherbivores except as introduced in the chapter on biotic interactions and as covered in\nthe next chapter dealing developing new plants.

With respect to these\nbiotic causes of plant disease, plant pathologists describe what is called the \u2018disease tri-\nangle\u2019 where disease results from a combination of environmental conditions, host sus-\nceptibility, and the virulence of a disease-causing organism. Disease is a consequence of a\ncombination of three factors, hence a triangle: a susceptible plant encountering a compe-\ntent (i.e. virulent) pathogen under environmental conditions that favor the invasion and\nspread of the pathogen. A classic example of the disease triangle is late blight of potato,\ncaused by the water mold Phytophthora. Potato is native to South America but was\nbrought to Europe in the 17th century as a food crop. The disease organism, which also\naffects tomatoes, apparently originated in Mexico in the early 1800\u2019s. The disease requires\ncool, moist conditions, a susceptible potato host and a virulent pathogen. The pathogen\nspread throughout North America in the early 19th century and made it to Europe prob-\nably as a result of importation of diseased potatoes to Belgium in 1845. It quickly spread\nthroughout Europe, and in particular to Ireland, where potatoes were the primary food\nsource and were grown extensively in monocultures. The cool moist conditions typical of 496 | CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS\nIreland were well-suited to the growth and reproduction of the pathogen. Moreover, the\npotatoes grown were genetically uniform and also highly susceptible to the blight. The\nresult was devastating, over a million Irish died of starvation and another million emi-\ngrated, mostly to the United States. The severity of the blight varied over the next twenty\nyears, primarily due fluctuations in environmental conditions. Note that crop failure not\nonly eliminates food, it also eliminates \u2018seed potatoes\u2019 (potatoes saved to be planted the\nfollowing year). Thus, even if favorable conditions might yield a relatively high crop (yield\nper acre), food shortages persist because fewer acres may have been planted. Late blight\nof potato continues to be a problem, with outbreaks tied to environmental conditions.\nThere are partially resistant varieties but these are only temporary because the pathogen\nevolves to overcome the plant\u2019s resistance.\nThe pathogen is an obligate biotrophic\nparasite, meaning it can only survive on a\nliving host (but it does eventually kill sub-\nstantial parts or all of its host). It survives\nfrom year to year on potato tubers or\npotato plants left in the field. It spreads\nreadily by spores (usually asexual) that\nrequire moisture to stay alive and are dis-\npersed by wind and by raindrops.\nFFiigg.. 77 PPhhyyttoopptthhoorraa iinnffeessttaannss oonn ttoommaattoo,, aa\nPathogen growth and spread can be\ncclloossee rreellaattiivvee ooff ppoottaattoo..\nextremely fast if weather conditions are\nappropriate. The spores germinate quickly and enter susceptible plants through stomata,\nwounds, and directly through the cuticle. Once inside the leaf they produce hyphae that\ngrow between cells and produce haustoria that penetrate the cell wall and interact with\nthe host cell membrane and allow nutrients to pass to the fungus.\nThe disease requires a match between the host and the pathogen. P. infestans infects potato\nand also tomato, which is a close relative of potato. But many other close relatives are not\nsuitable hosts. And there are other species of Phytophthora that affect other plant species\nbut do not infect potatoes, e.g. P. quercina causes sudden oak death syndrome CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS | 497\nWWhheeaatt rruusstt\u2014\u2014ccoommpplleexx ppaarraassiittee lliiffee ccyycclleess\nThere are many different rust diseases that affect a variety of hosts, and some utilize two\ndifferent hosts. All are host specific meaning that they can affect only a group of closely\nrelated plants: a variety, a species or several species from a single genus. The life cycle for\nwheat rust was introduced in Chapter 12 and a figure from that chapter is reproduced\nbelow. Note that five different types of spores are produced. They differ from each other\nby their ploidy level (diploid, dikaryon or haploid), what type of plant they are produced\non, and what type of plant they can grow on (if any) and how they function. These are\ndescribed below:\nFFiigg.. 88 LLiiffee ccyyccllee ooff wwhheeaatt rruusstt,, sshhoowwiinngg tthhee fifivvee ttyyppeess ooff ssppoorreess tthhaatt aarree pprroodduucceedd..\nteliospores are dikaryon spores and the only stage of the life cycle that grows,\nalbeit very temporarily, independent of a host. It also is the only stage that can\noverwinter. 498 | CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS\nbasidiospores are haploid spores produced after the teliospore germinates and\nundergoes karyogamy to produce a diploid cell. This cell then undergoes meiosis\nto produce haploid basidiospores. These spores are dispersed in the air and only\ngerminate and grow on barberry plants.\npynciospores are haploid spores produced from hyphae produced in a structure\nemerging from the upper surface of barberry leaves. Also in this structure are hap-\nloid receptive hyphae which can receive pynciospores and fuse with them (plas-\nmogamy) to form dikaryon hyphae. These grow to the lower surface of the leaf\nand form a structure called an aecium that produces dikaryon aeciospores that are\ndispersed by the wind and infect wheat plants.\nMycelial dikaryotic growth from the aeciospores can cause significant damage to\nthe host wheat plant and also produces urideospores, produced in and orange\nstructures called uremia. The uridospores spread Puccinia graminis to other wheat\nplants, facilitating disease spread.\nAs the wheat plant starts to senesce, both from the pathogen and from its natural,\nmonocarpic cycle, the dikaryotic hyphae in the wheat plant produce teliospores,\nspores that can survive the winter and thus completing the life cycle.\nFFiigg.. 99 PPuucccciinniiaa ggrraammiinniiss oonn wwhheeaatt sstteemmss\u2014\u2014tthhee oorraannggee ssttrruuccttuurree\naarree uurreeiiddiiaa aanndd pprroodduuccee uurreeddiioossppoorreess tthhaatt ccaann iinnffeecctt ootthheerr\nwwhheeaatt ppllaannttss.. CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS | 499\nBecause wheat is an extremely important crop and because the disease spreads rapidly and\nevolves quickly, wheat rust is probably the most significant agricultural disease. Resis-\ntance to the disease involves the genetics of both the fungus and the plant. Resistant\nplants have an ability to recognize invasion by the fungus and to respond to it. Recogni-\ntion of the fungus is the result of the plant perceiving a chemical produced by the fun-\ngus. An avirulent fungus can become virulent by becoming unrecognizable, typically by\nnot producing a specific chemical that that the avirulent (and thereby recognizable) fungi\nhad been making. Hence virulence in the pathogen is typically recessive (inability to make\nsomething that the wild type does make). Plant resistance requires a dominant gene that\ngives the plant the ability to recognize and respond to the presence of the virus.\nCCoorrnn ssmmuutt\u2014\u2014MMeexxiiccaann ttrruufflffleess\nFFiigg.. 1100 CCoorrnn ssmmuutt..

Like the rusts, smut diseases are basidiomycetes and like the rusts the fungus is\ngenerally found in the dikaryon state, with cells possessing two haploid nuclei. Basid- 500 | CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS\niomycetes only produce only a single diploid cell that immediately undergoes meiosis\nto form haploid spores. These germinate and grow into haploid hyphae that, in smuts,\ncan produce new cells by budding like yeast and like yeast can be grown on an artificial\nmedium, meaning that this stage is NOT biotrophic but acts like a saprophyte. However,\nwhen haploid hyphae of two different mating types find each other and fuse and form\na dikaryotic hyphae, it is now biotrophic, only able to survive on living cells of spe cific\nplants, in this case, corn and teosinte (a close relative of corn). Hence, to be a successful\npathogen the haploid hyphae need to find each other on living corn (or teosinte) plants.\nAdditionally, the dikaryon hyphae only invade active tissues, most commonly the flow-\ners, where they induce abnormal growth, galls, with greatly enlarged cells surrounded by\nhyphae. They do not form typical haustoria but do form structures that allow the transfer\nof materials from the plant to the fungus. As the galls mature they change color from silky\nwhite to black and also change textures, becoming softer. Although the galls look \u2018fungal\u2019\n(if such a thing is possible!) they are actually mostly plant tissue. Inside the galls some\nfungal cells undergo karyogamy (fusion of the two haploid nuclei) to form a diploid cell\nand complete the sexual cycle. Corn smut is the most significant smut disease but there\nare other smut fungi that infect other agricultural grasses (sugarcane, barley, oats) as well\nas smuts that attack wild grasses and sedges.\nRRiiccee bbllaasstt ddiisseeaassee\u2014\u2014cchhaannggiinngg ppaatthhooggeenn ssttrraatteeggiieess\nFFiigg.. 1111 RRiiccee sstteemmss iinnffeecctteedd wwiitthh rriiccee bbllaasstt ddiisseeaassee CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS | 501\nRice blast is a devastating fungal disease that affects several cereals but is most significant\nin affecting rice.

Haploid spores land on rice leaves, developing\nfruits, and other plant parts, and are able to penetrate the cuticle by generating substan-\ntial pressures hydrostatically within a specialized cell called an appressorium. Once inside\nthe fungus is able to spread by entering individual plant cells through plasmodesmata.\nAfter a certain amount of time that depends upon the tissue that has been invaded, the\nfungus shifts to a necrotrophic lifestyle, killing the host cells.\nFFiigg.. 1122 RRiiccee lleeaavveess\niinnffeecctteedd wwiitthh rriiccee bbllaasstt\nddiisseeaassee..\nDDuuttcchh eellmm ddiisseeaassee\u2014\u2014oovveerrrreeaaccttiinngg ccaann bbee ddeeaaddllyy\nDutch elm disease is caused by an ascomycete fungus that has a symbiotic relationship\nwith a bark beetle, a type of beetle that feeds on the vascular cambium and tissues (sec-\nondary xylem and phloem) that the vascular cambium produces.

From these locations E. amylovora can be spread by pollinators throughout\na plant and throughout an entire orchard.

But\naltered levels of plant growth substances can also be a consequence of the pathogen caus-\ning its host to produce more or less of a particular substance. The most common way this\nhappens is that the pathogen alters gene expression in its host. Agrobacterium tumifaciens\ndoes this by actually altering the genes present in host cells via a process called transfor-\nmation, a type of horizontal gene transfer. Among other genes that are transferred is one\nthat codes for the production of the plant growth substance cytokinin which plays a role\nin the cell proliferation required for gall formation. The bacterium lives saprophytically\nin the soil but is able to recognize wounded plants when it contacts them and is trans-\nformed into a virulent form that makes its way into the plant. A. tumifaciens is a signif-\nicant pathogen on several crop species, in particular perennial ones like walnut, apricot\nand plum. Agrobacterium tumifaciens is notable for its very broad range of hosts. This is\none of the reasons why it has proved useful in the genetic engineering of plants where it\nis used to transfer specific genes from one organism to another (Chapter 31).\nTToobbaaccccoo mmoossaaiicc vviirruuss,, ccaauulliiflfloowweerr mmoossaaiicc vviirruuss,, aanndd\nrriinngg ssppoott ddiisseeaassee ooff ppaappaayyaa\nPlants are affected by a large number of viruses that can cause very significant crop losses.\nTobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is not one of the most damaging viral pathogens, but it is CHAPTER 30: THREATS TO AGRICULTURE: INSECTS AND PATHOGENS | 505\nFFiigg.. 1166 RRiinngg ssppoott vviirruuss oonn ppaappaayyaa\nnotable both because of its role in the understanding of viruses and its use in bioengineer-\ning.

Plants don\u2019t live for-\never and many crops are annuals or are harvested less than a year after planting. Although\nthe earliest agricultural efforts may not have involved intentionally propagating plants,\nfundamental to the development of agriculture was the acknowledgment that making\nnew plants is an essential part of the process. The techniques used to propagate plant\ncrops vary depending upon the crop. For most familiar crops it required storing some seed\n(i.e. not eating it) and planting it at some point in the future. For crops such as cereal\ngrains and most legumes, where the seed is the part that is harvested and eaten, develop-\nment of the \u2018store and plant\u2019 technology was relatively straightforward and rapid. How- CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS | 509\never, crops such as tomato, squash and eggplant, where a fleshy fruit is harvested and the\nseeds are small and inconspicuous, required more technology: a recognition that seeds\nwere present in the fruit and a method for processing of some of the fruit to obtain seeds\nfor planting. Perennial plants do not require propagation each year, they could be main-\ntained without propagation. But eventually they required some means of making new\nplants, especially if the agriculturalists are moving to a new area. For reasons discussed\nbelow, propagation of perennial plants often did not involve seeds but instead asexual\nmeans of propagation.\nFor most of its existence agriculture did not involve attempts to produce novel plants,\nplants with characteristics that distinguished them from their parents. However, the hope\nfrom the earliest onset of agriculture was that one might be able to improve the charac-\nteristics of the crop, producing crops that yielded more, tasted better, stored better, were\neasier to harvest, and were more tolerant of hardships, in particular, more tolerant of dis-\nease. Primitive farmers were happy when they found desirable novelties and were able,\nknowingly or unknowingly, to gradually change the crops they grew. But they did not\nhave the understanding and technology to intentionally create something novel. This has\nbecome possible over the last 100 years. Although an understanding of aspects of asexual\nreproduction was important for some crops, it was the recognition of the sexual process\nin plants, in particular the functioning of flowers and pollination, that has been critical to\nthe development of the technologies of crop improvement (Fig. 2). All of the major crops\nhave been, and continue to be, intentionally modified. And this is one of the many factors\nthat has changed, and made more complex, the business of agriculture. Where it was once\nbasically controlled by a farmer who served both as a producer and salesman, it is now\na vastly more involved system that depends on farmers, seed producers, researchers, fer-\ntilizer producers, equipment manufacturers, agricultural scientists, the government, and\nvast array of \u2018middle-men\u2019.\nTOPICS\n\u2022 Asexual reproduction\u2014propagation by cuttings\n\u2022 Sexual reproduction by seeds and the importance of breeding system\n\u2022 Hybrid seeds\n\u2022 The green revolution\n\u2022 Creating novel plants 510 | CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS\nFFiigg.. 22 SSeeeeddlleessss wwaatteerrmmeelloonn,, aa nnoovveell ttyyppee ooff ffrruuiitt ddeevveellooppeedd rreecceennttllyy tthhaatt\nhhaass tthhee ddeessiirraabbllee ffeeaattuurree ooff nnoott pprroodduucciinngg sseeeedd..

In fact, the apples that you might har-\nvest will probably be less than desirable. Similar patterns would be found for grapes and\nolives, two ancient crops. In order to perpetuate desirable plants of such species these\ncrops have been propagated not from seed but instead asexually. The easiest technique is\n\u2018rooting\u2019, cutting a stem and placing it in moist soil in hopes that it will sprout roots (see\nthe discussion adventitious roots in Chapter 8). A similar procedure can be done with\nroots, inducing them to produce new shoots. Since the middle of the 20th century an arti- CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS | 511\nficial plant hormone has been used to promote adventitious growth in shoots/roots that\nmight not do so otherwise.\nObviously, asexual propagation does not produce novel material, it only perpetuates exist-\ning ones. It is important in a large number of vegetable crops including banana, pineap-\nple, potato, sweet potatoes, cassava and many more. It also is the most common means\nof propagating many ornamental flowering plants (e.g. geranium, begonia). For some\nof these plants (e.g. banana and some hybrid flowers) asexual reproduction is essential\nbecause the plant is a sterile hybrid and cannot produce viable seeds. For other species,\ne.g. potato (Fig. 3), pineapple (Fig. 4) and many others, asexual reproduction is simply an\neasier and quicker means of propagation, eliminating the seedling stage that is sometimes\nmore sensitive to conditions than cuttings are. A disadvantage of asexual propagation is\nthat the clones are genetically uniform and thus crops are more susceptible to widespread\nfailure (e.g. in late blight of potato). Another problem is that viral diseases are transmit-\nted in cuttings but not through seeds.\nFFiigg.. 33 SSpprroouuttss oonn aa ppoottaattoo,, tthheessee aarree bbrraanncchheess\nggrroowwiinngg ffrroomm aa mmooddiififieedd sstteemm ((tthhee ppoottaattoo))..

For annual species\ngrown as crops, propagation only requires the\ndiscipline to store seeds for the next season.\nUnlike asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction\ncan result in variation. Variation has positive and\nnegative effects on farming. On the one hand it\nallows for crop improvement and the production\nof novel plants (see below). On the other hand\ncrop uniformity is generally helpful to agricul-\nture because it makes cultural practices (e.g.\nplanting and harvesting) more easily handled.\nSignificant to crop variability is the breeding sys-\ntem of the crop. If the crop has a closed breeding\nsystem (Chapter 17) as the result of being\napomictic or from having a bisexual flower and\nbeing self fertile, then offspring are likely to be\nthe same as their parents and a crop may show\nFFiigg.. 55 EEaarrllyy 2200tthh cceennttuurryy sseeeedd ccaattaalloogg,,\nlittle variation. Additionally, if a novel plant does\nsshhoowwiinngg sseevveerraall vvaarriieettiieess ooff ggrreeeenn\nbbeeaannss.. appear, a closed breeding system makes it easier\nfor a farmer to perpetuate plants with that spe-\ncific feature. For instance, an important characteristic for cereal grains is to have \u2018non-\nshattering\u2019 heads, meaning inflorescences that do not shed their seeds, holding them on\nthe plant and making harvesting easier. With a closed breeding system, seeds from non-\nshattering heads are likely to pass that feature on to their offspring since they may have\nno sexual process at all (apomixis) or are most likely to breed with themselves. In contrast,\nplants with a more open breeding system are more likely to be variable, with offspring\nthat don\u2019t all look alike and don\u2019t necessarily look like their parent. And when a plant\nwith favorable characteristics is found, it is more difficult to perpetuate these features\nthrough time. In fact, it is likely that these features will disappear quickly, from being\n\u2018washed out\u2019 by breeding with individuals that do not possess the feature. It is also signif-\nicant that population size and reproductive isolation influence variability. A population 514 | CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS\nof plants with an open breeding system may be very uniform if the population is small\nand reproductively isolated from other populations of the same plant, as can be the case\nfor crop species.\nHHyybbrriidd sseeeedd\nEven before an understanding of the basis of genetics was developed the phenomenon of\n\u2018inbreeding depression\u2019, had been noted: the decline in vigor in populations that are con-\ntinually inbreeding. The degree to which this happens varies among species. It is probably\nnot surprising that inbreeding depression is not a generally a problem for species with\nclosed breeding systems. But for plants with open breeding systems, inbreeding can cause\nsubstantial reductions in crop yield. This was recognized by farmers and was part of the\nreason that seed companies, who took steps to avoid this problem, developed a clientele.\nEarly in the 20th century plant breeders realized that although inbreed lines show reduced\nvigor, a \u2018hybrid cross\u2019 between two inbreed lines, produced plants that were more vigorous\nthan either of the parental lines before they had been inbreed. Central to the production\nof hybrid seed is the need to control who breeds with whom. The technique requires that\nmultiple generations bred only with close relatives, something that is easily accomplished\nby having populations isolated from each other. The next step is more difficult: ensuring\nthat the inbreed lines NOT breed within the population but instead breed with individu-\nals of another inbreed line. This was first done with corn, a plant with separate male and\nfemale flowers that are located in different parts of the plant. Crossing of inbreed lines\ncan be accomplished by removing the male flowers (detasseling) from one inbreed line,\nthereby making these plants solely female and ensuring that any seed produced had a male\nparent from a separate plant, usually from a second inbreed line that was planted nearby.\nHybrid corn was first developed in the 1930\u2019s and became the dominant seed source by\n1950, with yields increasing dramatically.\nLarge scale production of pure hybrid seed is nearly impossible in plants with perfect\nflowers (both male and female structures in the same flower). However, botanists dis-\ncovered that it is possible to make plants with perfect flowers become unisexual. In the\nlate 18th century workers noticed that not all pollen was viable and the ability to produce\nviable pollen sometimes often showed maternal inheritance. Later work indicated that\nthere were cytoplasmic (i.e. non-nuclear) factors, inherited maternally (in plastids), that\ninfluence the production of viable pollen. Thus, geneticists were able to produce plants\nthat were \u2018male sterile\u2019, not able to produce viable pollen. Having plants that were uni- CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS | 515\nsexual (female) made the crosses that were needed to produce hybrid seed much more\nfeasible. Hybrid seed production was further enhanced when \u2018restorer genes\u2019 were found\nthat would restore the ability to make viable pollen. This allowed breeders to two cross\ntwo lines, one of which was unisexual, yet have the resulting hybrid produce flowers that\nare fully functional. Because of cytoplasmic male sterility the number of plants for which\nhybrid seed could be produced increased dramatically. Another means to the same end is\nthe use of \u2018chemical hybridizing agents\u2019, chemicals that make plants male (usually) sterile.\nHybrid seed has several favorable features in addition to producing vigorous plants. The\nplants in a hybrid crop are more uniform than those produced from open pollinated seeds.\nUniformity in size and time of maturation may greatly enhance harvesting. Hybrid crops\nalso allow favorable traits developed in parental lines to be combined.\nA negative consequence of planting hybrid seed is that seed cannot be stored year to year.\nAlthough the hybrid plant is vigorous, offspring of the hybrid plants are much less vigor-\nous and also more variable. Growers utilizing hybrid seed need to purchase seed each year\nor switch to using open pollinated seeds instead of hybrid seed.\nAnother negative consequence of hybrid seed was highlighted by the southern leaf blight\nthat had a significant impact on corn production in the U.S. in 1970 and 1971. The blight\nwas a problem because of crop uniformity, a uniformity caused by the fact that although\nthere were multiple strains of corn that were grown, they all were hybrid seed that had\nbeen developed using the same cytoplasmic male sterility factor which, along with affect-\ning male sterility, also made them susceptible to a novel strain of fungal pathogen that\nappeared in the 1960\u2019s. In subsequent years corn breeders reverted to the older strategy\nof detasseling corn.\nTThhee GGrreeeenn RReevvoolluuttiioonn\nIn the late 1960\u2019s several scientists warned of an inevitable global famine, based in part on\nthe assumption population increases would vastly outpace increases in agricultural pro-\nduction based on the assumption that crop yields could not be significantly improved.\nFortunately agricultural research, with a series of innovations that became known as the\n\u2018green revolution\u2019 was able to drastically increase yield (Fig. 6) and the global famine did\nnot occur, although local famines continue to be a problem, usually the result of poli-\ntics and war. Central to the green revolution were the efforts of Norman Borlaug, both 516 | CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS\nas an agricultural researcher who developed high yielding varieties and as administrator\nwho worked extensively to have new agricultural practices accepted by countries includ-\ning Mexico, India and Pakistan. Central to the green revolution was hybrid seed and the\ndevelopment of new high yielding varieties of wheat and rice. Surprisingly, these varieties\nwere actually dwarf plants. This had one direct effect: the problem of \u2018lodging\u2019 (plants\nbeing knocked over, usually as the result of wind) was lessened because the plants were\nshorter. But the new varieties also had a number of other features that helped to increase\nyield: increased seed production per plant, enhanced disease resistance (especially against\nrusts) and greater tolerance of drought or excessive rain. Also significant was the ability\nof new varieties to respond with increased yield to increased levels of fertilization. As a\nresult of the new varieties and the new agricultural practices, crop yields increased dra-\nmatically throughout the end of the 20th century.\nFFiigg.. 66 CChhaannggeess iinn wwhheeaatt yyiieelldd iinn tthhrreeee ccoouunnttrriieess dduurriinngg tthhee \u2018\u2018GGrreeeenn\nRReevvoolluuttiioonn\u2019\u2019 CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS | 517\nHow can crops be improved? And who does the work of crop\ndevelopment?\nCrop development requires careful observations and recognition of individuals with\nfavorable traits. By the end of the 19th century the importance of generating variability\nwas increasingly recognized as being significant to crop development. However, in gen-\neral, farmers desire crop uniformity because it makes growing and harvesting easier and\ntheir focus is on growing crops not developing crops. During the 19th century, seeds were\nincreasingly provided by the sources other than the farmer storing seeds or exchanging\nseeds with neighbors, and crop improvement was increasingly out of farmers\u2019 hands. Dur-\ning the latter half of the 19th century the federal government provided seed to anyone\nwho asked for it. And, at the end of the century, land grant universities were charged with\nimproving agriculture and this included developing improved varieties of crops. During\nthis time period, private commercial seed companies became increasingly important as\nboth a source of seeds and as a venue for improving crop quality.\nCCrreeaattiinngg nneeww ppllaannttss uussiinngg aasseexxuuaall mmeetthhooddss ooff\npprrooppaaggaattiioonn\nAlthough asexual reproduction is cloning, simply perpetuating what already exists, it has\noften been important in crop innovation. Novel plants are sometimes produced sponta-\nneously by mutations in the seed or in branches of existing plants, and asexual repro-\nduction of these mutants allows them to become new crops. This is what happened with\nnavel oranges (Chapter 28), McIntosh apples (and many other apple varieties), poinset-\ntia (Chapter 30), and a large number of ornamental plants. Cloning is also important\nas a means of perpetuating plants (generally hybrids) that have been created naturally\n(without human intervention) or artificially (with human intervention) that are unable to\nreproduce sexually.\nRelated to asexual reproduction is grafting, cutting a branch or bud off one plant and\nattaching it to a different plant, producing a novel organism, a chimera. There are a vari-\nety of reasons why this practice might be desirable, but one obvious one is in order to\ncombine the favorable traits of two individuals into one individual, e.g. a good root sys-\ntem with a good shoot system. This is well represented by wine grape propagation. Stems\nfrom a European species are grafted on to root stocks from a North American species.

The root system of the European species\nis highly susceptible to Phylloxera but produces grapes of superior quality for wine. Phyl-\nloxera was mistakenly introduced from North America to Europe in the early 1800\u2019s and\ndevastated European wine production. It was revived when workers were able to plant\ngrapes composed of European shoots grafted on to North American rootstocks. Most fruit\ntrees (apple, peach, plum) are similarly constructed with rootstocks that are vigorous and\ndisease resistant grafted to shoots that produce desirable fruits.\nCCrreeaattiinngg nnoovveell ppllaannttss uussiinngg tthhee sseexxuuaall pprroocceessss\nRecall that the sexual process generates variability and evolutionists would argue that\nwhile this may not be the reason for its origin, it probably is the reason for its widespread CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS | 519\noccurrence. As discussed above, crops can be modified utilizing variation developed\nthrough the sexual process. But below are listed techniques that are capable of more vari-\nation more rapidly:\nCrossing with relatives\nThe relatives might be ancestral varieties that the crop originated from or species closely\nrelated to the crop. Technically, a crop species should should not hybridize with other\nspecies (i.e. it is an isolated gene pool, see Chapter 17) but sporadic seed production does\noccur when plants are crossed with close relatives. Although successful crosses may be\ninfrequent, as long as there are some viable offspring, these can be back-crossed to the\noriginal crop (i.e. cross the hybrid plants with plants from the parental population) with\nsignificant introduction of novel traits (i.e. variability) that may include desirable fea-\ntures. Occasionally, workers are successful crossing with more distant relatives (different\ngenera, even different families). Part of this surprising possibility may be poor taxonomy\n(i.e. they actually are more closely related than depicted in the taxonomy) but apparently\nsometimes crosses can happen between plants that are not that closely related.\nPolyploidy\nFor a cross to be successful the parents need to have the same chromosome number and\nthe chromosomes of the two parents need to be similar enough that they can pair during\nmeiosis. When hybrids between different species are produced they are generally sterile\nbecause of the inability to pair chromosomes during meiosis. Although the hybrid is ster-\nile it is often possible to propagate it asexually, i.e. to clone the hybrid, . A number of\nornamental plants are perpetuated this way. It also is what has occurred with banana, the\nplant that is cultivated is a sterile hybrid, unable to produce seed but this one of the fea-\ntures that make the commercial banana desirable! Another \u2018solution\u2019 to the problem of\nhybrid sterility is polyploidy, increasing the chromosome number. This sometimes hap-\npens without human involvement (see discussion of the evolution of wheat in Chapter 28)\nbut in the last 100 years workers have developed techniques to promote polyploidy fol-\nlowing hybridization, thereby creating a new species with characteristics of both parental\nlines. 520 | CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS\nTreatment with mutagens\nA common means of generating variability, and perhaps producing favorable traits that\ncan be selected for, is to treat the seeds with a chemical mutagen or radiation. Although\nmost of the treated seeds do not survive or have unfavorable features, usually some seeds\nsurvive and some of these may have desirable features. These plants can be crossed with\nexisting varieties in hopes of introducing favorable features to the crop. The technique is\nalso used with asexual propagation. The original ruby red grapefruit appeared as a sport\non a normal grapefruit tree. Irradiation of branches of the original ruby red has produced\nthe even redder varieties: Rio Red and Star Ruby.\nGGeenneettiiccaallllyy mmooddiififieedd oorrggaanniissmmss\nA much more focused technique of combining traits from different organisms is the pro-\nduction of \u2018GMO\u2019s, genetically modified organisms; the phrase should be non-sensical to\nany trained biologist because all organisms are genetically modified, that is what evo-\nlution is about. But if we focus only on agricultural organisms the term has come to\ndistinguish \u2018normal\u2019 agricultural organisms, all of which have a long and substantial his-\ntory of genetic modification by humans from \u2018abnormal\u2019 agricultural organisms, ones pro-\nduced using the relatively recent techniques of molecular biology that allow for much\nmore focused genetic modification, with genes manipulated in various ways including:\nturned on, turned off, duplicated, removed and, in particular, moved from one organism\nto another. One famous example is \u2018golden rice\u2019, rice to which additional genes, genes\nthat cause the rice produce beta-carotene, a vitamin D precursor, have been introduced\ninto the endosperm of the seed. A second example is \u2018Bt\u2019 corn, which has a gene derived\nfrom the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, that produces a protein that is toxic to some\ninsects, in particular the corn borer moth. Consequently \u2018Bt-corn\u2019 can avoid predation by\ncorn borers. Interestingly, these bacterial toxins had been used by organic farmers, after\nbeing mass produced by culturing B. thuringiensis, extracting the toxins and then spraying\nthem on corn plants. A final example is \u2018Roundup ready\u2019 soybeans. Roundup is a com-\nmonly used herbicide that is effective because it blocks an important bio-synthetic path-\nway. Plant molecular biologists were able to introduce genes into several crops, including\nsoybean and cotton, that greatly reduced the the toxicity of roundup to these crops, mak-\ning them \u2018roundup ready\u2019. The advantage of modern molecular techniques is specificity:\nplants are modified in very specific ways. In contrast, developing new crops by hybridiza- CHAPTER 31: CREATING NEW PLANTS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL PLANTS | 521\ntion or by chemical or radiational means will have multiple effects \u2014 yet the breeder is\nonly paying attention to a small number of characters they are hoping to modify.\nGMO\u2019s have been vigorously opposed by a variety of groups for a variety of reasons. This\nopposition has decreased substantially in the last five years, partly because many of the\nproblems that were cited have not appeared even though GMO plants have been in wide\nuse over the last fifteen years. Any large-scale production of crops with novel character-\nistics will have possible risks, but the GMO\u2019s are probably one of the more benign tech-\nniques to generate variability. Consequently the production and use of GMOs is likely to\nincrease in the coming years.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cThe genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs\nwith expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop\u201d by\nTina Kyndt et al.

How might these fifty-plus groups\nbe organized? The simplest method is an alphabetical list; this is done in the Table of\nContents of the book and is also present as a list at the end of this section. Another, and\na more \u2018biological\u2019, way to organize (i.e. classify) these groups would be in a taxonomic\nscheme, utilizing four of the five kingdoms sometimes used to group organisms: Moner-\nans, Protists, Fungi and Plants. But, as discussed in the introduction, the five-kingdom\nclassification has largely been replaced with more phylogenetic approaches. Unfortu-\nnately, such classifications are still in flux and are also unwieldy, as a visit to most general\nbiology textbooks will attest.\nInstead, and since this book emphasizes the structure and nutrition of different groups,\nthe following classification of organisms is presented based on\n\u2022 their mode of energy acquisition\n\u25e6 heterotroph, autotroph (photosynthetic and chemosynthetic)\n\u2022 their structural features\n\u25e6 prokaryote vs. eukaryote,\n\u25e6 composition (cellular nature, see Chapter 3)\n\u25aa unicellular, multinucleate, colonial or multicellular\nTable 1 presents such a classification and Table 2 repeats it with links to the groups cov-\nered.

Other members of the\nsame group that we will consider are Oedogonium, Chlamydomonas and Cladophora, all of\nwhich are quite different in form and structure.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nThe green algae are generally put in their own phylum, Chlorophyta, but this phylum is\nplaced variously depending upon the perceptions of the observer. Some workers still con-\nsider them to be one of the protist phyla. Workers who reject the protist kingdom often\nput green algae in the \u2018Archaeplastid supergroup\u2019. However, since some of the green algae\nare closely linked to plants, some workers combine plants and some or all of the green\nalgae into a \u2018Viriplantae\u2019 group. (See the reading on Chlamydomonas for more details on\ngreen algal classification.)\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nAcetabularia has an unusual structure by being large, unicellular and possessing features\nthat might be considered organs \u2014\u2018 roots, stems and leaves\u2019. The single cell is attached\nto the substrate by root-like cellular extensions. These extensions connect to an elongate\nstalk that ends in an umbrella-like cap which is often 1 cm or more across. The single\nnucleus of this remarkable organism is found at the base of the stem. If the stalk is cut it\ncan regenerate a new top and the top can generate a new base, although it is short-lived,\npresumably because it lacks a nucleus. ACETABULARIA, AN UNUSUAL UNICELLULAR GREEN ALGAE | 537\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nSexual reproduction in Acetabularia is\ninitiated when the single (diploid)\nnucleus goes through multiple mitotic\ndivisions; these nuclei subsequently\nundergo meiosis and migrate to the cap\nwhere they are released in cysts that\nbreak open to release mobile gametes. If\nthese gametes find gametes from another\nalga they fuse to form a zygote that\nattaches to a substrate and grows into\nthe mature form. Asexual reproduction\nis also possible if mobile (diploid)\nzoospores are released and behave like\nzygotes, attaching to a substrate and developing into the mature form.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nAcetabularia is a typical photoautotroph, using the energy of sunlight to synthesize car-\nbohydrates from carbon dioxide and then using the carbohydrates as an energy source\nin cellular respiration and as building materials to synthesize a variety of biomolecules.\nIn some species the chloroplasts show an endogenous circadian movement from the cap\nto the rhizoids at dusk and back at dawn. Since the organism is capable of regenerating\ncaps if they are removed (even though it is a single cell), this movement may be adaptive\nby preserving resources. In addition to acquiring the minerals elements required for life\n(Chapter 22) Acetabularia is unusual in being able to take up and sequester mercury.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nAcetabularia is generally found in warm, marine waters. Since it attaches to substrates and\nrequires light for photosynthesis it is generally found in shallow waters, to depths that\ndepend on water clarity. Acetabularia is eaten by sea urchins and fish. 538 | ACETABULARIA, AN UNUSUAL UNICELLULAR GREEN ALGAE\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Acetabularia mediterranea life \u00a9 LadyofHats is licensed under a Public Domain license AGARICUS BISPORUS, THE\nCOMMERCIAL MUSHROOM\nAgaricus bisporus, is the most familiar mushroom for most of us \u2014 it is the commercial\nmushroom sold in grocery stores and put on pizza. It comes in various forms: button ver-\nsions, brown versions and large portobello versions \u2014 all of which are varieties of the\nsame species. Its popularity is not so much a consequence of flavor as it is a consequence\nof its suitability for commercial production. Agaricus does grow wild, typically in fields or\nlawns but all of the Agaricus mushrooms sold in stores are grown on a controlled medium\nand in a controlled environment, often in caves or underground structures, not so much\nfor the darkness but because of constant temperatures and high humidities.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nAgaricus, and nearly all of the fungi that\nwould be described as mushrooms, i.e.\nthat produce stalked structures with a\ncap, are club fungi = basidiomycete fungi\n(Phylum Basidiomycota). Most mush-\nrooms have \u2018gills\u2019 on the underside of the\ncap where spores are produced, and Agaricus shows this feature. Historically all mush-\nrooms with gills were put in a taxonomic entity (usually an order, the Agaricales) but\nrecent molecular analysis has demonstrated that gills are not a sound feature on which to\nbase a phylogenetic classification. Although there still is an order Agaricales, named for\nAgaricus, it does not contain all gilled mushrooms and it does include a number of fungi\nthat do not possess gills. 540 | AGARICUS BISPORUS, THE COMMERCIAL MUSHROOM\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nLike nearly all fungi and nearly all club fungi, the bulk of a mushroom\u2019s structure is a net-\nwork of branching filaments, one cell thick (hypae), that permeate a substrate. In the case\nof wild Agaricus, the substrate is the soil; for cultured Agaricus the substrate is a prepared\ncompost, typically manure with other material added to it. In club fungi the filaments are\ncellular, meaning that there are individual cells delineated by the presence of cross-walls\n(septa). The septa are not complete but usually have a pore in the middle that allows cyto-\nplasm to move from one cell to another. The fruiting body of Agaricus is a consequence\nof drastic change in the behavior of hyphae. Instead of growing in a diffuse manner and\nspreading throughout their environment, they grow close to each other and intertwine,\nforming a solid structure that emerges from the substrate it is growing in and produces\nthe familiar mushroom structure\nTThhee uunnddeerrssiiddee ooff aa mmuusshhrroooomm ccaapp,,\nsshhoowwiinngg tthhee ggiillllss,, tthhee llooccaattiioonn ooff ssppoorree\npprroodduuccttiioonn.. AGARICUS BISPORUS, THE COMMERCIAL MUSHROOM | 541\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nAgaricus completes its sexual cycle by producing basidiospores on the margins of the gills\nof the mushroom. Like almost all fungi in the Basidiomycete group, the organism exists\nprimarily in a \u2018dikaryon\u2019 state where each cell has two nuclei, one from each parent pro-\nduced after two haploid hyphae fuse. Only in certain parts of the fruiting body do the two\nnuclei fuse to form a diploid cell that then undergoes meiosis to produce haploid, \u2018sex-\nual\u2019 spores. However, for a mushroom farmer, reproduction of Agaricus is totally asexual.\nThey do not sow spores, instead they use pieces of mycelium (the name given to cluster\nof hyphae), induce it to grow, and then stimulate it to produce fruiting bodies. Some of\nthe mycelium remains and can be used to continue the process. The mycelium is probably\ncapable of living thousands of years.\nLLiigghhtt mmiiccrroossccooppyy ooff ggiillll mmuusshhrroooomm sshhoowwiinngg aa sseeccttiioonnaall vviieeww ooff tthhee mmuusshhrroooomm wwhheerree\ntthhee ggiillllss ccaann bbee sseeeenn wwiitthh bbaassiiddiioossppoorreess lliinniinngg tthhee ggiillllss..

They secrete enzymes into their environment that break down organic matter into\nsimple forms that can be absorbed into the hyphae and then they re-assemble these mate-\nrials to make new fungal biomass. Fungi are considered \u2018decomposers\u2019, but what is not\noften appreciated is that their nutrition is the same as predators, herbivores and omni-\nvores (including humans). All are heterotrophs and obtain nutrition by breaking down\n(decomposing) organic material produced by other organisms. As a result of their activi-\nties they make more of themselves (i.e. they could be considered a \u2018producer\u2019) but because\nthey break down much more material than they produce they are net \u2018decomposers\u2019. AGARICUS BISPORUS, THE COMMERCIAL MUSHROOM | 543\nIn commercial operations, the mycelia are\nfeed \u2018conditioned\u2019 compost. You may have\nheard that mushrooms eat horse drop-\npings \u2014 this isn\u2019t exactly true. To feed\ncommercial mushrooms farmers take\ncompost containing horse droppings and\nother materials (e.g. straw) and allow it to\nferment for a week or two. During this\ntime the compost is \u2018eaten\u2019 by bacteria,\nother fungi and microscopic animals.\nThese organisms break down the com-\npost, putting it in a form more acceptable to the commercial fungus. They also build up\ntheir populations, and the commercial fungus feeds on these \u2018primary decomposer\u2019 popu-\nlations. So the commercial fungus doesn\u2019t eat horse droppings, it eats things that them-\nselves eat horse droppings, along with the remnants of horse droppings left behind after\nthe \u2018first\u2019 eating.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nLike most organisms, interactions between Agaricus and other organisms and the physical\nenvironment are extremely important to its success. This is reflected in the links below\nthat describe how mushrooms are commercially grown. As described above, Agaricus is\nknown as a \u2018secondary decomposer \u2019\u2014 it feeds on material after it has been eaten by \u2018pri-\nmary decomposers\u2019; this is similar to the interaction of cows with the microorganisms in\ntheir stomachs. Cows cannot digest grass, they need the microbes to act on the grass (in\none of their stomachs) and produce something that they can utilize. Agaricus is also very\nstrongly affected by (i.e. interacts with) physical conditions, in particular temperature,\nhumidity and the concentration of carbon dioxide. These conditions both control the\nmycelium to growth rate and also the initiation of fruiting bodies.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cAgaricus bisporus\u201d by Michael Kuo.\n\u25e6 http://www.mushroomexpert.com/agaricus_bisporus.html 544 | AGARICUS BISPORUS, THE COMMERCIAL MUSHROOM\n\u2022 \u201cAgaricus bisporus, the white button mushroom or pizza mushroom, also\nknown as Portabella and Crimini\u201d by Tom Volk and Kelly Ivors.\n\u25e6 http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/apr2001.html\n\u2022 \u201cFungiculture\u201d on Wikipedia.\n\u25e6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungiculture\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Agaricus bisporus \u00a9 0x010C is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Field Mushroom Gills \u00a9 AmateurNaturalist is licensed under a CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution NonCommercial\nShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Coprinus \u00a9 Jon Houseman and Matthew Ford is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Coprinus \u00a9 Jon Houseman and Matthew Ford is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Britannica Mushroom Pasture Mushroom is licensed under a Public Domain license ALFALFA\nAlfalfa (Medicago sativa), is an important\nperennial herbaceous crop. Most people\nare familiar with annual crops (planted in\nthe spring and harvested in the fall), and\nwith woody perennial crops (grapes,\napples, cherries) but there also are peren-\nnial crops that are non-woody. While a\nfew produce food for humans (sugar cane,\nasparagus, rhubarb, groundnuts) most\nherbaceous perennial crops are \u2018forage\u2019\ncrops producing food (usually called \u2018hay\u2019)\nfor domesticated animals, especially\nhorses and cattle. While many think of\nhay as being annual and perennial grasses,\nthere are a number of dicot flowering\nplants, including alfalfa and clover, both\nperennials, that are very important\nsources of \u2018hay\u2019. Humans do eat alfalfa plants, but only in the form of alfalfa \u2018sprouts\u2019,\nyoung germinated seeds.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nAlfalfa is in the pea family. It is a flowering plant (angiosperm) and is a dicot (eudicot) in\none of the largest and most important plant family, the pea family, which includes numer-\nous important crops and many ecologically important species. 546 | ALFALFA\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nAlfalfa growth produces a typical stem with alternate, trifoliate leaves and branches that\noriginate in the axils of these leaves. However, this growth only lasts a year in most of the\n(temperate) habitats where the plant grows, habitats where winter cold kills most of the\nabove ground plant. Alfalfa\u2019s existence as a perennial depends upon what is known as a\n\u2018crown\u2019, which is a section of the stem close to the ground surface. This structure produces\nadventitious buds that provide for growth after most of the above ground portion of the\nplant dies in the winter. Under agricultural conditions the crown also allows the plant\nto re-sprout after nearly all of the above ground portion of the plant has been harvested.\nHarvesting often occurs up to six times over the growing season.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nAlfalfa is a typical flowering plant that\nhas bisexual flowers that require pollina-\ntion in order to set seed.

Because of human introductions it is\nnow found world-wide, primarily in temperate habitats. It is slightly invasive and can be\nfound on roadsides and other disturbed habitats in addition to habitats that are under\ncultivation. It is drought tolerant and does well on sites that are quite dry. Consequently\nalfalfa is grown extensively in the western US. Its root system commonly goes down three\nmeters into the soil to acquire water and occasionally goes down 15 m (over 50 feet!!!!).\nInterestingly, it produces chemicals that deter the germination of its own seeds, necessi-\ntating that fields alternate from alfalfa to another crop before being reseeded in alfalfa.\nBecause honeybees are poor pollinators, farmers growing alfalfa for seed (as opposed to\ngrowing it for hay in which case pollination doesn\u2019t matter) rely on other pollinators.\nThese other pollinators need to be managed to produce generate the high pollinator pop-\nulation densities needed to effect pollination.

Unlike most mushrooms (gill fungi) that produce spores on linear rows (gills)\n(see Agaricus), these fungi produce spores in a tissue perforated with numerous cylindric\npores, generally from 0.2 to 2 mm in diameter, through which the spores are shed. Fungi\nproducing such structures are called polypore (\u2018many pores\u2019) fungi, and while there are a\nfew polypore fungi that do produce a \u2018 mushroom\u2019 shaped fruiting body, the majority of BRACKET FUNGI | 551\npolypore fungi are bracket fungi, growing off trees trunks and branches like a shelf or a\n\u2018bracket\u2019.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nBoth of the genera discussed here (Fomes and Gan-\noderma), and all fungi considered bracket fungi,\nare Basidiomycetes (club fungi) in the Kingdom\nFungi.

As\na result of certain stimuli the hyphae will\ngrow in a very different way (highly con-\ndensed and intertwined) and in a different place (outside the tree stem) to produce a\nfruiting body, where special cells associated with sexual reproduction, are produced. The\nfruiting body of both these genera is described as being \u2018trimictic\u2019, meaning that it is com-\nposed of three different types of hyphae: generative hyphae, the ones that produce spores;\nskeletal hyphae, with very thick-walled hyphae and little branching; and binding hyphae,\nhyphae with extensive branching. 552 | BRACKET FUNGI\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nBoth of these fungi undergo the normal sexual process shown by basidiomycete fungi\n(\u2018club-fungi\u2019).

They are called \u2018heart rot fungi\u2019, feeding on the heartwood, the central cylin-\nder of tree trunks that contains no living cells. Sapwood, the outer part of a wood, does\ncontain some living cells, although a majority of the cells are dead at maturity. The living\ncells of the sapwood provide the tissue with greater resistance to fungal invasion, hence\nmost wood eating fungi are able to infect heartwood but not sapwood.\nBoth of these fungi are described as \u2018white-rot\u2019 fungi, a name that describes the feeding\npreferences of the fungus. Wood has three main components: cellulose, hemicellulose\n(both polysaccharides) and lignin (a complex polymer of phenolic subunits). Wood rot BRACKET FUNGI | 553\nfungi often specialize, i.e. they have dietary preferences, for either carbohydrates or lignin.\nThese species leave behind the material that they don\u2019t \u2018choose\u2019 to eat, either lignin, which\nis generally brown in color, or cellulose, which is white. Brown-rot fungi leave behind the\nlignin, white-rot fungi leave behind the cellulose. Since using wood for paper or to make\nethanol requires removing lignin, there is an interest in developing technologies that uti-\nlize white-rot fungi to do this.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nSince they kill no living tissues, these fungi will not directly kill trees but they may\ndecrease the mechanical strength of trunks and cause them to break more easily (however,\nsome argue that hollow cylinders are stronger under some circumstances than solid cylin-\nders, in which case the action of these fungi might be considered to improve strength).\nThe fungi need some sort of damage to the tree to allow them to enter the heartwood, this\ndamage can come from a variety of agents: shedding of branches; damage from abrasion\nby the falling of neighboring trees or branches; feeding by wood eating herbivores such as\nbeaver and porcupine; abrasion by deer and moose \u2018rubbing\u2019 the tree with their antlers or\nby bears stretching their claws; boys playing with hatchets.\nThe fungal hyphae are sometimes food for insects (larvae) that may in turn be food for\nother insects or for woodpeckers.\nBoth these fungi have interesting interactions with humans\u2013read more about these below.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cGanoderma applanatum, the artist\u2019s conk\u201d by Thomas J.

But it is actually just a single large\ncell. And since an individual organism might\nbe two meters in extent, Caulerpa produces\nthe largest cells on earth, except for maybe\nsome plasmodial slime molds. They are\nmostly found in shallow waters in warmer\noceans but a few occur in fresh water.\nPhylogeny and Taxonomy\nCaulerpa is in the green algal phylum\nCCaauulleerrppaa pprroolliiffeerraa\n(Chlorophyta), in a group generally consid-\nered to be a class labelled the Ulvophyceae, a group not considered to be closely related to\nland plants although other green algae are. There is more discussion of green algae in the\nChlamydomonas page.\nStructure\nCaulerpa is siphonaceous (coenocytic) meaning that the cells are multinucleate and specif-\nically in this case there is only a single cell per organism. They typically have a horizontally 556 | CAULERPA, A LARGE COENOCYTIC GREEN ALGAE\nrunning structure off of which come extensions to attach it to the substrate (\u2018roots\u2019) and\nextensions to increase photosynthetic area. Depending on species, these may be blade-like,\nfeather-like or spherical.\nSex and Reproduction\nMost commonly Caulerpa reproduces\nasexually by fragmentation but it is also\ncapable of sexual reproduction, although\nthe details are not completely known. The\nalgae sometimes concentrate their proto-\nplasm in the tips of blades/leaves where it\nbecomes cellular and is released as uninu-\ncleate gametes while the rest of the plant\nsenesces and dies. The released gametes\nCCaauulleerrppaa sseerrttuullaarriiooiiddeess are capable of fusing with each other. At\nthis point the knowledge of the life cycle\nfalters. Meiosis must occur at some point but it is not known if it occurs right after syn-\ngamy, right before the production of gametes or perhaps that there are both haploid and\ndiploid plants that look alike (cf. Ulva, see Chapter 11).\nMatter and Energy\nCaulerpa is a typical photosynthetic autotroph, acquiring carbon as bicarbonate ion\n(HCO \u2013) which is produced when carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid\n3\nwhich then ionizes. The carbon is used to produce hexose sugars that are then used both\nfor material needs (to make cell walls, cell membranes, amino acids, etc) and also for ener-\ngetic needs when the hexose are oxidized in oxidative phosphorylation. Caulerpa acquires\n14 other elements obtained by absorbing small ions from the water.\nInteractions\nCaulerpa oxygenates the environment it is in and serves as a food source for a number of\nanimals. However, it does produce toxins. Like the toxins associated with red tides and CAULERPA, A LARGE COENOCYTIC GREEN ALGAE | 557\nproduced both by dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, some toxins affect certain herbivores\nwhile others herbivores are unaffected but may accumulate the toxin, thereby allowing\nit to affect consumers of the herbivore. Caulerpa is native to warm waters around New\nZealand and Australia but is invasive in parts of the Mediterranean and off southern Cal-\nifornia, where it is sometimes causes a variety of problems. It\u2019s spread to new areas may\nbe partially due to its use in aquaria and their disposal in nearby waters.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Caulerpa prolifera \u00a9 B.

As is often the case, especially in taxon-\nomy, looks can be deceiving (think convergent evolu-\ntion). And, although Chara are among the green algae\nmost closely related to plants, the visual similarity\ndoesn\u2019t actually attest to this. Instead the connection\nis justified because of biochemical features (sporopol-\nlenin and precursors of lignin), plasmodesmata, the\npresence of a cell plate during mitosis, the presence and\nstructure of flagellated sperm and, of course, a multi-\ntude of molecular data\nStoneworts get their name because they usually have\ncalcium carbonate deposits in their cell walls, a conse-\nquence of the hard water (high calcium) habitat that they often grow in, perhaps coupled\nwith their own activities increasing the pH, which can cause calcium carbonate precipi-\ntation out of the aqueous solution. Stoneworts are large algae that can dominate some\nhabitats. CHARA, THE STONEWORTS | 559\nTaxonomy and Phylogeny\nThe Green Algae group is in flux. The group has clear\nconnections with plants but if plants are put in a sep-\narate kingdom (Kingdom Planta, of the five kingdom\nclassification), this affiliation is hidden unless the\ngreen algae are also placed in the plant kingdom.\nSome workers do this. Others split the green algae in\ntwo, putting algae with the closest affiliation to land\nplants in a streptophyte group, and putting all other\ngreen algae (the majority of species) in a chloro-\nphyta group (this would include the other green\nalgae covered in the \u2018Organism\u2019 section of this book:\nChlamydomonas, Oedogonium, Acetabularia, Calurpa).\nStoneworts would be in the Streptophyte group and\nalthough they look \u2018plant-like\u2019, other streptophytes do not, e.g. the filamentous algae Spir-\nogyra, or the unicellular desmids. Stoneworts are usually put in the Characeae family with\na group of five other genera besides Chara.\nStructure\nStoneworts are large algae easily visible with the naked eye and possessing a distinctive\nwhorled form, with a cluster of branches at nodes and elongate internodes separating the\nnodes. The internode consists of a single elongate cell up to 10 cm in length which in\nsome species is surrounded by a ring (cortex) of smaller cells. Particularly significant evo-\nlutionarily is that the cells possess plasmodesmata and this is associated with the forma-\ntion of a cell plate during cell division. Chara has filamentous rhizoids that attach it to\na substrate. Sexual structures occur as short branches at the nodes and are of two types,\nboth multicellular: egg producing structures and sperm producing structures. 560 | CHARA, THE STONEWORTS\nDetail of a stoneworts alga showing the typical reproductive organs: male antheridia (red)\nand female archegonia (brown).\nReproduction\nChara reproduces asexually by producing several different types of structures that can be\ndetached, dispersed and then develop into new plants. They also reproduce sexually, pro-\nducing eggs that are retained and mobile, flagellated sperm. After a zygote is formed (the\nonly diploid cell in the Chara life cycle) it develops into an oospore that is tolerant of\nadverse conditions and is capable of dispersal. When conditions are favorable the oospore\ngerminates and undergoes meiosis; three of the four haploid nuclei degenerate with the\nother one dividing to produce a new haploid plant.\nMatter and energy\nChara is a typical photoautotroph, using the energy of sunlight to synthesize carbohy-\ndrates from carbon dioxide. It is significant that it often grows in areas with pH values CHARA, THE STONEWORTS | 561\nof 7 and above, where bicarbonate is a significant source of carbon dioxide. Bicarbonate\nand protons can combine to form carbonic acid and this can be converted to carbon diox-\nide and water. This latter reaction is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase enzymes found in\nthe cell walls of Chara and the reaction also raises the pH and causes the precipitation of\ncalcium carbonate in the cell walls. In addition to the accumulation of carbon, hydrogen\nand oxygen in carbohydrates Chara accumulates 14 mineral elements obtained from the\nsolution that it grows in.\nInteractions\nChara is commonly found in hard water (high calcium ion concentrations) environments\nand sites with brackish waters. They often form extensive beds and are found in slow\nmoving streams and shallow lakes, especially if the water is clear. Chara may contribute\nto that clarity by absorbing and immobilizing nutrients, making them less available for\nother algae. While some species of epiphytes (algae that grow on other plants) avoid\nChara, perhaps because of allelochemics, some nitrogen fixing cyaanobacteria associate\nwith Chara and may provide nitrogen. Some species of Chara are considered weeds and\nmay be invasive. The extremely large cells of Chara and closely related Nitella have been\nused to study membrane electrophysiology and the behavior of the membrane.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Chara fragilis \u00a9 Christian Fische\n\u2022 Haeckel desmidiea \u00a9 haeckel 562 | CHARA, THE STONEWORTS\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cChara: Occurrence, Features and Reproduction\u201d by Neelesh T.

They are one of the groups of \u2018fern allies\u2019, groups unified by having\nvascu lar tissue but lacking seeds. The other groups are the ferns, horsetails and wisk\nferns (some people lump these three groups together into one phylum). Although ferns\nand clubmosses can be linked by what they do not have (seeds) this is not a good criterion\nfor forming a group and for this reason, and many others, ferns and clubmosses are NOT\nthought to be phylogenetically close, so the \u2018fern allies\u2019 are not grouped together. The\nLycopodiophyta includes three groups, clubmosses, spikemosses and quillworts.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nAs the name implies, clubmoss sporophytes (the spore producing form) look like mosses\nbut they are generally bigger, reflecting the fact that they have vascular tissue, and they\noften have \u2018clubs\u2019 or strobili, structures where spores are produced. The plants have the\ntypical plant structure of an elongating axis that bears flaps of tissue, \u2018leaves\u2019 that pos-\nsess on a single strand of vascular tissue. Clubmoss leaves are called \u2018microphylls\u2019 to dis-\ntinguish them from true leaves (\u2018megaphylls\u2019) that have more extensive venation. On\nsome clubmoss and spikemoss species the leaves are overlapping and resemble those of\ncedar, which gives some species a common name of ground cedar. Most species produce\nabove and/or below ground stems that run horizontally and send up vertically oriented\nbranches.

Its\nancestry tells some interesting tales. For\nmost crop species a wild \u2018relative\u2019 is read-\nily apparent. This is not the case for maize\nbut the answer may actually depend on\nwhat one means by \u2018apparent\u2019. There is no\nplant that bears strong resemblance to\ncorn, especially in terms of its \u2018ear\u2019, a clus-\nter of female flowers and later fruits. Its\nclosest relative, called teosinte, differs in\nseveral ways from corn. Significantly, it\ndiffers in ways that make it an unlikely\n\u2018proto-crop\u2019, one that humans might\nmanipulate by selective harvesting and\nplanting in order to make it more desir-\nable. However the genetic differences\nbetween teosinte and corn turn out to be\nquite small, differences in developmental genes that can greatly alter the \u2018looks\u2019 of a plant\nand, significantly, alter features that make it a desirable crop. Thus there IS an ancestor\nof corn, a species of teosinte that grows wild in Mexico. But it doesn\u2019t look much like corn\nand has features, in particular a small number of fruits that are encased in very rigid struc-\ntures, that don\u2019t make it a likely candidate for domestication.\nWhether teosinte was actually utilized agriculturally and favorable characteristics (more\nfruits that are easier to open) were selected for, or a more suitable version appeared \u2018on\nits own\u2019, without human intervention, is not known. Regardless, once a version of corn\nappeared, probably 9000 years ago, it was rapidly transformed by early farmers selecting\nfor favorable traits, in particular larger ears. Less than 2000 years ago modern versions of CORN | 585\nthe crop appeared in the area that is now part of Mexico and rapidly spread throughout\nmost of the Americas. It is an unusual grass in a number of ways: there are separate male\nand female flowers (most plants and most grasses have bisexual flowers) and it produces\nseeds that do not fall off the plant as those of most grasses do.\nFemale flowers Tassels, clusters of male flowers\nMMaallee flfloowweerrss wwiitthh ssttaammeennss eexxeerrtteedd.. 586 | CORN\nUnisexual flowers of corn: female flowers (above) are clustered on a branch\ncalled an ear. There are typically 1 to 3 ears per corn plant, occurring (as they\nalways do!) in the axils of leaves, male flowers are also clustered on special\nstems, these occur at the top of the plant in structures called tassels.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nCorn is a flowering plant in the monocot group, a phylogenetic entity that includes\norchids, palms, lilies and grasses. The grasses are put together in the Poaceae family, a\nlarge family that includes staple crops (wheat, rice) and is also extremely important eco-\nlogically, often dominating regions.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nTo people who think grasses always look like those in their lawns, corn looks quite dif-\nferent: it is large, both in terms of height and in the width of leaves. Initially the \u2018stem\u2019 is\nactually just the round basal parts (the sheaths) of individual leaves, with the oldest leaves\non the outside and newer leaves being produced inside. As is the pattern in grasses and\nmany other monocots (see the discussion of banana \u2018stems\u2019 in Chapter 8), the shoot api-\ncal meristem stays at the very base of the plant, near the ground. The \u2018stem\u2019 is produced\nby the sheaths of multiple leaves. Eventually a true stem emerges from the interior as the\nshoot apical meristem is elevated, \u2018telescoping\u2019 up the space formed by the sheaths of sev-\neral leaves. The stem elongation ends when the shoot apical meristem transforms into a\nflowering meristem, producing a clusters of male flowers (the tassel) at the top of the\nstem. As is typical of all plants, branches form in the axils of leaves; what is unusual is that\nthese branches produce very little stem, only a short axis with multiple female flowers.\nThe base of this flowering branch produces multiple leaves that grow over the flowers to\nform the ear of corn. Emerging from the tip of the ear are the strands of \u2018silk\u2019: the stigma\nand style of each individual flower enclosed in the ear. CORN | 587\nCorn produces prop roots, a type of adventitious root (Chapter 7) that functions to sup-\nport the stem. Adventitious roots are\nroots that originate in an abnormal place,\nusually from the stem, the result of a\nmeristem developing in the stem that pro-\nduces a structure that grows at a roughly\n45 degree angle rather than straight down.\nProp roots do not function to absorb\nwater and nutrients, instead they attach\nthe stem more firmly to the soil.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nCorn reproduces sexually and is difficult to propagate vegetatively. Because it has separate\nmale and female flowers it is very easy to control breeding and corn was the first crop\nfor which hybrid seed was produced. Hybrid seed is produced by crossing two different\ninbreed lines and results in F1 plants that are particularly vigorous (see Chapter 28 and\nChapter 31).\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nCorn is a photosynthetic autotroph that uses the C4 photosynthetic pathway. Like most\nC4 plants, it has a particularly high rate of photosynthesis, has a high water use efficiency\n(carbon dioxide fixed compared to water loss) and will benefit less from rising carbon\ndioxide levels than C3 plants (Chapter 20).\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nCorn is obligately tied to human agriculture and could not survive were it not for our\nefforts. It has been developed for a wide number of uses including animal feed (fodder,\nsilage), fuel (ethanol), home heating (corn/pellet stoves), and a wide variety of food prod-\nucts. It is now grown world wide and is second only to rice in terms of world-wide pro-\nduction.

Monocots have a number of features that distinguish them\nfrom other flowering plants: a single cotyledon in the seed, lack of secondary growth,\nflower parts typically in 3\u2019 s, and stems with scattered vascular bundles. 592 | CORALLORHIZA, A PLANT THAT EATS FUNGI\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nOrchids are herbaceous perennial plants that have several\ndistinct growth forms. Many orchids are epiphytes, plants\ngrowing on the trunks of other plants, and may have fea-\ntures including \u2018aerial roots\u2019 and \u2018pseudobulbs\u2019 which allow\nthem to be successful under these conditions. Corallorhiza\norchids do not have a typical orchid structure because they\nare non-photosynthetic and have very reduced/no leaves\nwhile most orchids have very visible leaves that may be stiff,\noval and overlapping or sometimes may be grass-like. Many\norchids produce rhizomes (horizontal stems running below\nground), corms (short, fattened vertical stems) or tubers\n(enlarged stems that are not oriented vertically).\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nMost orchids exhibit sexual reproduction that is possible because of elaborate pollination\nmechanisms that most commonly involve bees or wasps. The flowers of orchids are\nunusual because pollen is not dispersed as individual grains but rather in large packets\n(\u2018pollinia\u2019) that represent the the entire anther of an individual stamen and contain thou-\nsands of pollen grains. Seeds of orchids are extremely small, often less than 0.5 mm, some-\ntimes less than 0.1 mm (less than 100 microns). This small size is possible because there\nis no endosperm, the embryo is much smaller than in most seeds and the seed coat is\nvery thin. Because of the lack of endosperm, the germinating seeds of most orchids must\nquickly associate with a fungus in order for the fungus to provide the seed with the nour-\nishment needed in order for the orchid to become established. Note that although plant/\nfungus associations are very common (e.g. in mycorrhizae), the relationship found in in\nthe germinating orchid seeds reverses the normal flow of carbohydrates: in a typical plant/\nfungus association plants transfer carbohydrates to fungi, but in germinating orchid seeds\nthe flow of carbohydrates is from the fungus to the plant. Once the orchid produces a\nphotosynthetic structure the flow of carbohydrates is reversed; however, this never hap-\npens in Corallorhiza because it never produces a photosynthetic structure. CORALLORHIZA, A PLANT THAT EATS FUNGI | 593\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nCorallorhiza is a very unusual angiosperm because it is a heterotroph, a parasitic het-\nerotroph, surviving on biomolecules that it does not produce but instead are acquired\nfrom a host organism (a fungus) that it associates with. Unlike most orchids that rely\non \u2018mycotrophy\u2019 (fungus-eating) just during the seedling establishment phase (see above),\nCorallorhiza plants never become photosynthetic and never produce their own carbohy-\ndrates. Their mineral nutrition is also supplied by their host because they produce no\nroots to explore the soil to acquire nutrients. There are several other unrelated flowering\nplants with a similar lifestyle, including Indian pipes (Monotropa uniflora) and Snow flower\n(Sarcodes spp.). There also are flowering plants that parasitize the roots of other flower-\ning plants: beech drops (Epifagus virginiana), witch flower (Striga spp.), and also those that\nparasitize the stems of other flowering plants: dodder (Cuscuta), mistletoe (Phoradendron,\nViscum).\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nCorallorhiza, and orchids as a group, have two interactions that have already been noted:\nwith fungi during seed germination and with bees and wasps in many elaborate polli-\nnation mechanisms. In spite of the fact that there are lots of species, the group is not\nparticularly significant ecologically (i.e. it does not dictate the activities of communi-\nties/ecosystems). Orchids have limited economic importance, being rarely used as food,\nalthough the spice vanilla comes from an orchids. Orchids have become important to the\nflorist industry (e.g. as corsages) and also as house plants.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cOrchids of New York\u201d by Chuck Sheviak and Steve Young\n\u25e6 https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/administration_pdf/orchidsofny.pdf\n\u2022 \u201cMyco-heterotrophy: when fungi host plants\u201d by Vincent Merckx, Martin\nI.

They are unicellular and have two flagella\nwith an anterior groove. Their chloroplasts have four membranes, reflecting secondary\nendosymbiosis, i.e., that a eukaryote ingested another eukaryote, in this case one with a\nchloroplast (see Diatoms). Because of pigmentation, the second endosymbiotic event is 596 | CRYPTOMONADS, UNICELLULAR PHOTOSYNTHETIC ALGAE\nthought to have involved a red algae being ingested by a unicellular heterotroph. This\npattern is also thought to be the case for dinoflagellates and diatoms. Cryptomonads\npossess unusual structures called ejectisomes that can be discharged when the alga is dis-\nturbed, triggering movement that may deter a herbivore. Reflecting their secondary\nendosymbiotic origin, they have DNA in four locations: a nucleus, the mitochondrion,\nthe chloroplast and in a structure called a nucleomorph, thought to be a remnant of the\nnucleus present in the cell of the second endosymbiotic event. They have no cell wall but\ndo have a proteinaceous layer just inside the plasma membrane similar to the pellicle\nfound in dinoflagellates. As might be expected for an organism lacking a cell wall, they\npossess contractile vacuoles to maintain water levels.\nSex and reproduction\nThere is some evidence for sexual reproduction in at least one species but primarily they\nreproduce asexually by mitosis.\nMatter and energy\nAlmost all cryptomonads possess photosynthetic pigments and are photosynthetic\nautotrophs, acquiring carbon and 16 other elements in inorganic form from their envi-\nronment. However, cryptomonads do require B vitamins, reflecting their heterotrophic\nancestry. And a few species lack photosynthetic pigments and are heterotrophs, obtaining\nfood by phagocytosis (invagination of the cell membrane to engulf a food particle). Some\nphotosynthetic forms are also capable of phagocytosis, indicating mixotrophy (being both\nan autotroph and heterotroph).\nInteractions\nBecause red light penetrates deeper in the water column and because cryptomonads pos-\nsess phycobiliproteins pigments that can utilize red light, cryptomonads can photosyn-\nthesize at greater depths than other algae, and cryptomonads are often found at greater\ndepths than other algae. Although they are not a particularly diverse group, they appear\nto be quite important in several habitats, typically cooler ones, both marine and fresh\nwater, serving as the base of food chains.

Its com-\nmon name, dandelion, comes from the\nFrench \u2018dent de lion\u2019 (tooth of a lion)\nreferring to the shape of the leaves. It is\nwidely recognized as a weed, a word that\ngenerally means that it is an undesirable\nplant (more details in Chapter 29), unde-\nsirable because it grows in places where\npeople are trying to grow something else\n(e.g. in lawns or in crop fields), and, at least to some people, undesirable because of its\nlooks \u2014 perhaps not so much the bright yellow flowers, but more likely because of the\nfruit heads and the rosettes of leaves in an otherwise uniform carpet of grass. In an eco-\nlogical sense dandelions are weeds because of their ability to disperse and their associa-\ntion with \u2018disturbed\u2019 habitats. In order to persist in a habitat that continually gets\ndisturbed, a plant needs to be \u2018tough\u2019: able to survive, grow and reproduce even when dis-\nturbances that might kill other plants occur. Weeds typically disperse readily, grow\nquickly and are able to reproduce in spite of a variety of adversities. At the same time,\nmost ecological weeds are poor competitors and, if disturbances do not occur, weeds will\nbe replaced by species that are better competitors. Consider the distribution of dande-\nlions in the Adirondack Park: they are rarely found in \u2018undisturbed\u2019 situations but are\nfound where human activity \u2018disturbs\u2019 the area \u2014 next to campsites and along the margins\nof trails, places where competitors of dandelions aren\u2019t able to become established because\nof the trampling by people. In a comparable situation, dandelion can thrive in agricultural\nfields because it can tolerate the (often) annual tilling the soil because of the ability of\nroots to regenerate whole plants. 600 | DANDELION\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy aanndd ttaaxxoonnoommyy\nDandelion is an angiosperm, the group\nwhose members produce flowers and\nseeds (Kingdom Planta, Phylum Magno-\nliophyta or Anthophyta). Dandelions are\nin one of the largest families within the\nangiosperms, the aster / sunflower family\n(Asteraceae), a group that is usually easy\nto recognize because the flowers occur in\ndense clusters (inflorescences) that them-\nselves look like a single flower. The genus\nTaraxacum is a large and complex group, owing to the complications of apomixis and\npolyploidy (see discussion below).\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nDandelion has a typical plant structure: a root-shoot axis with leaves produced on the\nshoot. It is an herbaceous perennial plant that forms rosettes, very short stems with leaves\noccurring in a circular pattern. As is true in all flowering plants, in the axils of each leaf\nis an axillary bud. In many plants these axillary buds develop into branches but in dande-\nlion these branch shoots only develop into inflorescences, which, after developing fruits\nwill fall off the plant. Dandelion produces an enlarged storage root (little material can\nbe stored in the very short stem). This root is very capable of producing adventitious\nshoots; consequently, if one attempts to pull the plant up but fails to obtain all of the root,\nparenchyma cells in the remaining root develop into shoot apical meristems. These grow\nto the soil surface and again produce a rosette of leaves. One sometimes sees clusters of\ndandelion rosettes, resulting from a broken root that has produced multiple new shoots.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nDandelions (Taraxacum officinale) reproduce by producing seeds, but the seeds are pro-\nduced by apomixis, i.e. without the sexual process. Dandelion does produce flowers and DANDELION | 601\nthese appear normal and develop ovules. However normal meiosis does not occur (because\nthe cells are triploid) in these ovules and no haploid cells are produced; consequently\nhaploid female gametophytes (= embryo sacs) are not produced and no egg is produced.\nHence, there is no possibility of syngamy. However, seeds do develop \u2014 the embryo\nfound in the seed is not derived from a fertilized egg. Because there is no sex in Taraxacum\nofficinale it is not a \u2018real\u2019 species, i.e. an \u2018interbreeding group \u2019\u2014 there are multiple clones\nthat collectively are considered a species. There also are closely related species that are\nsexual and the multiple entities within the Taraxacum genus are difficult to delineate.\nDandelion seeds are actually one-seeded\nfruits with the fruit and seed wall fused to\neach other (as it is in sunflower and in all\nmembers of the sunflower family). The\ntop of the fruit develops into a parachute-\nlike structure that helps disperse the seed.\nIt has a stalk 1-2 cm long extending from\nthe top of the fruit. The stalk ends with\narms that radiate outwards. The arms\nhave feathery branches emerging from\nthem. Although the structure acts like a parachute by keeping the seed aloft for a longer\ntime than would be the case otherwise, the mechanism of action is very different because 602 | DANDELION\nthe structure does not \u2018capture air\u2019 as a parachute does but it allows air to flow through it\nin such a way that that a vortex of low pressure forms above the dandelion fruit and this\nis what retards the rate of descent (see link below).\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nDandelion is a typical photosynthetic autotroph. It acquires carbon dioxide from the air\nand 14 mineral elements from the soil in order to grow. Energy from the growth process\ncomes from cellular respiration where the plant oxidizes the carbohydrates formed in\nphotosynthesis in order to acquire energy as ATP.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nAs mentioned above, dandelion interferes\nwith certain human endeavors: gardening,\nfarming, manicured lawns. But dandelion\ndoes have some positive interactions with\nhumans \u2014 its greens are edible, delicious\nin fact, if eaten when young. The flowers\nare not only pretty but are also edible and\ncan also be used to color foods, e.g. dande-\nlion pancakes.\nDandelions can be used to make wine,\nhowever the dandelions are only being\nused as coloring/flavoring agent \u2014 the\nsugars that the yeast ferment must be provided from cane sugar, honey, grape juice, etc.\nDandelions flowers do produce nectar and pollen and these are resources for a number\nof insects, including honeybees. This would seem to be surprising since the plant does\nnot need pollen or a pollinator bringing pollen, in oder to produce embryos. However,\nat least some populations of dandelion apparently need the physical stimulation of flower\nvisitors in order to trigger the apomictic process that results in seed production.

They may be placed in the \u2018miscellaneous\u2019 kingdom, the Protist King- DIATOMS, UNICELLULAR PHOTOSYNTHETIC ALGAE | 605\ndom, which is practical but not phylogenetically accurate. They have affinities to several\nother groups, in particular the brown algae. In a number of taxonomic schemes they are\nplaced in a group called \u2018heterokonts\u2019, sometimes in a \u2018Chromista\u2019 kingdom and some-\ntimes in a Ochrophyta phylum. The groups that are sometimes associated with them\ninclude the \u2018golden-brown\u2019 algae, the brown algae, and some non-photosynthetic forms,\nin particular the water molds (Oomycota). It is now thought that the group originated\nfrom an endosymbiotic association of a red algae (a eukaryote) with another eukaryote\nand that the chloroplasts of diatoms and related groups represent derivatives of the red\nalgae. Since the red algae themselves (like all eukaryotes) are thought to have originated\nfrom an endosymbiotic event (this is considered to be the primary endiosymbiotic event),\nthe endosymbiosis that that produced diatoms is considered to be a \u2018secondary endosym-\nbiosis\u2019. Evidence for this can be found in the membrane system of the chloroplasts. The\nchloroplasts of red algae, green algae and plants have two membranes, one thought to be\nderived from a prokaryotic symbiont, a cyanobacterium (= blue-green algae), and one\nderived from the host that engulfed it (the phagosomal membrane (the membrane that\nsurrounds the particle being engulfed). The\nchloroplasts of diatoms (and groups thought to\nbe related to them) have four membranes. The\ntwo \u2018extra\u2019 membranes represent the outer mem-\nbrane of the engulfed red algae plus the phagoso-\nmal membrane of the second endosymbiotic\nevent. Diatoms, and the heterokont/chromista/\nochrophyte group as a whole, are thought to be\nof relatively recent origin, obviously after the\norigin of red algae and also well after the origin\nof plants. The coloration of the diatoms, and of\nthe photosynthetic members of the heterokont/\nchromista/ochrophyte group as a whole, is brown\nor yellow-brown (ocher is a yellow/brown color)\nand comes from the presence of a different pig-\nment, chlorophyll c, in addition to chlorophyll a. 606 | DIATOMS, UNICELLULAR PHOTOSYNTHETIC ALGAE\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nDiatoms are unicellular, and like most\n(but not all!) unicellular organisms, they\nare small, generally 20-100 um in size, and\nonly visible to the naked eye as dust. They\nhave a cell wall with a unique (in biologi-\ncal terms) composition, being composed\nof silica dioxide. Although silica dioxide is\na rare component of organisms it is a very\ncommon mineral. Quartz is silica dioxide,\nthus glass, sand and diatom cell walls all\nhave the same composition). The cell walls of most organisms are usually polysaccharide\nin nature (i.e., carbon based). Thus most cell walls would be considered \u2018organic\u2019 if one\ndefines organic on the basis of carbon (as most chemists do); but if one considers \u2018organic\u2019\nto mean relating to living things then silica dioxide sometimes is organic, but only rarely,\nas only a few other groups of organisms utilize the material in their structure (see horse-\ntails). Another distinctive feature of the cell wall of diatoms is that it is composed of two\ndistinct parts (\u2018frustules\u2019), a \u2018top\u2019 half that is slightly larger and whose sides overlap the\n\u2018bottom\u2019 half, much as the top of a shoe box fits over the bottom. The frustule is \u2018sculp-\ntured\u2019 with minute pores that give it a very decorative look. Diatoms come in two basic\nforms: radially symmetrical forms (image at top of first page) and bilaterally symmetrical\nforms, like the image at the start of this section. When the diatom dies the two halves\nseparate and the top and bottom, being composed of a very stable material resistant to\ndecomposition, settle to the bottom of the body of water that the diatom was living in\nand become part of the sediment. Most diatoms exist as separate individual cells but a few\nare colonial, resulting from the failure of newly produced cells to separate from their par-\nent cell.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nDiatoms generally reproduce asexually by mitosis. The two frustules separate, each with a\nnucleus and cytoplasm. Each daughter constructs a new frustule. The newly constructed\nfrustule is always the bottom (smaller one). This means that one daughter cell (the one DIATOMS, UNICELLULAR PHOTOSYNTHETIC ALGAE | 607\ncoming from the \u2018top\u2019) is the same size as the original, and the other new cell is slightly\nsmaller. Thus, through time, the average size of a population of diatoms gets smaller. For\nmost diatoms, when they shrink to 1/3rd of the maximal size, sexual reproduction is trig-\ngered and, in the process, the maximum size is once again produced.\nSexual reproduction requires the normally diploid nucleus to undergo meiosis. The details\nof the sexual process vary considerably and show variations found in other sexual organ-\nisms. For most pennate diatoms, sexual reproduction does not involve distinct gametes\n(i.e. egg and sperm) and while meiosis produces four haploid nuclei, not all of these per-\nsist. Two cells fuse to one another, both undergo meiosis and the movement of haploid\nnuclei and their subsequent fusion allows one or two auxospores to be produced per\npair of cells. In centric diatoms two different types of gametes are produced. Some cells\nundergoes meiosis and produce one or two immobile eggs (again, two or three of the four\nhaploid nuclei produced by meiosis degenerate). Other cells undergo meiosis. In some\nspecies each of the four haploid cells develop into sperm In other species the products of\nmeiosis are not sperm but are sperm mother cells that will subsequently divide to produce\nup to 128 flagellated cells (sperm). Sperm swim to fertilize eggs which may or may not be\nreleased from their parent cell. Upon syngamy a structure called an auxospore is produced\nthat expands to produce the maximum sized cell.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nDiatoms are photosynthetic and are typical autotrophs, using the sun\u2019s energy to reduce\ncarbon and accumulate carbohydrates, and using the energy obtained from the oxidation\nof carbohydrates (i.e. respiration) to carry out a variety of life functions including the\nacquisition and accumulation of other elements necessary for life. Although, like all life,\nthey require N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ni, B, Cl, they also require at least\ntwo other elements, silica and selenium, that many organisms (in particular, most plants)\ndo not require.\n\u2022 A few diatoms are heterotrophic and obtain reduced carbon and other materials by\neating other organisms.\n\u2022 Diatoms generally store reduced carbon, at least for long-term storage, as lipids\nrather than carbohydrates as plants do. This is significant to their distribution\nbecause lipids provide buoyancy and may allow the organisms to stay in the upper 608 | DIATOMS, UNICELLULAR PHOTOSYNTHETIC ALGAE\nlevels of a body of water that receives more sunlight.\n\u2022 It is maybe significant that the silica cell walls of diatoms require considerably less\nenergy to construct than the carbohydrate based cell walls of most other organisms\nwith walls, in particular other unicellular algae. Some have argued that this is the\nreason that diatoms sometimes dominate the phytoplankton community.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nHere are a select few of the many interactions involving diatoms:\n\u2022 global ecology \u2014It is estimated that diatoms account for over 40% of the ocean\u2019s\nproduction of oxygen and reduced carbon. Therefore the group has a very substan-\ntial influence on important biogeochemical cycles, in particular for oxygen and car-\nbon, but also for mineral nutrients and for silica.\n\u2022 base of aquatic food chains\u2014diatoms are a key component of phytoplankton com-\nmunities which serve as \u2018food\u2019 for heterotrophs in these environments. When you\nare eating salmon, trout or tuna you are consuming at least some organic material\nthat was formed by diatoms and transferred through a number of trophic levels\nbefore becoming part of the fish that was your meal.\n\u2022 competition with other phytoplankton\u2014diatoms interact with a number of other\nunicellular algae in a competitive way (i.e. diatoms negatively affect the population\nsizes and growth rates of other algae). In at least some instances silicon plays an\nimportant role in this interaction, if silica is abundant diatoms are able to outcom-\npete other algae, if silica is scarce diatoms are outcompeted.\n\u2022 developing communities\u2014colonial diatoms commonly form a film on both biotic\n(other algae, snail shells) or abiotic (rocks, boat hulls) surfaces.

They\nare simply called \u2018the gnetophytes\u2019 after the name for the phylum, Gnetophyta. There are\nthree genera in the group, Ephedra and Gnetum, both with less than 100 species, and Wel-\nwitchia, which only has a single species. Welwitchia has a very limited distribution (the\nNambib desert of South Africa) while Gnetum is found world-wide in tropical areas and\nEphedra is found world-wide in shrublands (generally hot and dry habitats).\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nThe gnetophytes are generally put in their own\nphylum, one of four phyla of seed plants with-\nout flowers (the others being conifers, cycads\nand ginkgo). Collectively, these four groups are\ngrouped as \u2018gymnosperms\u2019 a group that some\nworkers consider a phylogenetic entity while\nothers do not, primarily because of difficulties\nrelating their relationships with extinct seed\nplants and with flowering plants. While gneto-\nphytes have some features (see below) in com-\nmon with angiosperms (and distinct from\nother gymnosperms), most feel that there is not enough evidence to group gnetophytes\nand angiosperms together in a phylogenetic entity. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has\nthe pine group as the gnetophytes closest relative. 616 | EPHEDRA: JOINTFIR\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nEphedra is a leafless shrub with multiple stems and branches that are typically 2 to 5 mm\nthick and green. The leaves are small, scale-like and often quickly fall off the plant. Plants\nproduce male cones that produce microspores which develop into pollen, and female\ncones that produce megaspores which are retained inside the cones and develop into\nfemale gametophytes inside structures called ovules. Unlike other gymnosperms, Ephedra\nplants possess vessels in their xylem tissue, a feature that is found in many, but not all,\nangiosperms.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all seed plants, Ephedra produces female gametophytes inside ovules. The zygote\nis formed when the egg, produced by the female gametophyte, is fertilized by a sperm\nnucleus produced by the male gametophyte (pollen). This zygote develops into a new\nsporophyte embryo that is packaged inside a seed, a mature (fully developed) ovule. Dou-\nble fertilization, where there are two sperm nuclei, one fusing with the egg and a second\nfusing with a second nucleus of the female gametophyte, is a feature once thought to be\nfound only in flowering plants. But it also occurs in at least some members of the genus\nEphedra, although the details, in particular the lack of development of an endosperm, dis-\ntinguish what happens in Ephedra from what happens in angiosperms. The female cones\nof some species become \u2018fruits\u2019 when the integuments thicken and become colorful. Tech-\nnically fruits (if defined as \u2018ripened\u2019 ovaries, a part of the flower) are only present in flow-\nering plants (angiosperms), but if defined as \u2018structures to promote the dispersal of seeds,\nfruits evolved independently in: angiosperms, some conifers (e.g. juniper, yew), some gne-\ntophytes (Ephedra) and ginkgo.

At least some species of Ephedra are\nwwiitthh aanntthheerrss..\npollinated by insects, another connection with\nangiosperms. However insect pollination may be an ancestral feature and therefore is\nprobably not a good feature to associate angiosperms with gnetophytes. Female cones of\nEphedra produce a \u2018pollination drop\u2019 at their tip that serves both to capture wind blown\npollen and to attract insects that may happen to be dispersing pollen. Some interpret\nthese observations to point to an evolution of nectar from a fluid that encouraged the\ncapture of wind-blown pollen. But other workers cite evidence that insect pollination is\nthe ancestral condition in the group and that the pollination drops that capture wind-\nblown pollen are derived rather than ancestral. 618 | EPHEDRA: JOINTFIR\nEphedra is a source of both ephedrine and\npseudoephedrine (a steroisomer of\nephedrine), alkaloids that have been used\nin diet pills, as a coffee-substitute, and as\na cold medicine.

In the past the group has been put in the Protist Kingdom.\nRecent phylogenetic studies have them diverging very early from other eukaryotes and\nconsequently putting them in a very small group that contains very unfamiliar unicel-\nlular organisms. Some close relatives of Euglena include the causal organism for sleeping\nsickness and for Chagas disease. Complicating their taxonomy is the fact that some in\nthe group are clearly composite organisms, being the product of secondary endosymbiosis\nwhen a green algal was consumed but not digested by a flagellate. 620 | EUGLENA: A UNICELLULAR ALGAE\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nEuglena is a unicellular organism with a complex internal structure that includes a con-\ntractile vacuole that can expel water and a red \u2018eyespot\u2019. Photosynthetic forms contain a\nchloroplast. They possess two flagellae, one long, one short, that can allow the organisms\nto move. Euglena are also able to move by means of changing its shape (see video links).\nOutside the cell membrane is a flexible, protein-based structure called a pellicle. Although\nnot generally considered a cell wall, it has similar functions in providing some rigidity\nand strength that the membrane cannot provide. However the pellicle is much more flex-\nible than most cell walls and allows for the change in form that is often seen in Euglena\nmotion.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nEuglena reproduces asexually when cells divide.

What\n6600 mmiilllliioonn yyeeaarr oolldd ggiinnkkggoo ffoossssiill\nthis means is that ginkgo is distinctly dif-\nferent in a number of ways from all other plants, and in particular from all other seed\nplants. Generally seed plants are divided into five groups, one of which is the Ginkgo-\nphyta; the others are: flowering plants, conifers, cycads and gnetophytes. Ginkgo is an\nancient group\u2014the figures above shows a modern leaf and also a fossil exposed in 60 mil- 624 | GINKGO\nlion year old rock. The genus is actually over four times this age with recognizable leaves\nin 250 million year old deposits. GINKGO | 625\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nGinkgo looks like a typical tree and, from\na distance, because of its broad leaves,\nwould be considered to be more closely\nrelated to angiosperm trees like oak and\nmaple than to conifers like pine and hem-\nlock. However, the wood of ginkgo, like\nthat of pines, hemlock and all conifers,\ncontains no vessels or fibers, only tra-\ncheids and parenchyma cells. Gingko, like\nsome conifers (e.g., larch) , has \u2018short\nshoots\u2019 (very slow growing shoots) and\n\u2018long shoots\u2019 (faster growing shoots). The\nshort shoots look like spurs on the stems\nand make identifying ginkgo easy in the\nwinter.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nGinkgo produces seeds that develop in the female \u2018cones\u2019, which resemble olive fruits. The\nspecies is dioecious, i.e. it has separate male and female plants. Male plants produce pollen\nin cones. The pollen is dispersed to female cones by the wind. Like Ephedra in the Gne-\ntophyta group, the female cones of ginkgo produce a drop of liquid that helps to capture\npollen. This drop, containing pollen, is pulled into the cone by capillary action as the drop\ndries. Once in the cone, the opening to the outside is closed and the pollen germinates and\nproduces a small, fungal-like structure, the male gametophyte, which acquires nutrition\nfrom tissues of the ovule. The male gametophyte matures and releases mobile, flagellated\nsperm into the liquid that is present in the \u2018canal\u2019 at the end of the ovule. These swim to\nthe female gametophyte and fertilize the egg to form a zygote. Flagellated sperm are pre-\nsent in all ferns, mosses, and liverworts but are extremely rare in seed plants, being found\nonly in Gingko, the cycads and some gnetophytes. 626 | GINKGO\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nGinkgo is a typical photosynthetic autotroph, capturing the energy of sunlight in carbo-\nhydrates and then using these carbohydrates both as a source of materials and a source of\nenergy. It is a C3 plant that acquires carbon dioxide as it diffuses through stomates from\nthe air into the leaves Interestingly, in the Mesozoic, when carbon dioxide levels were\nmuch higher than now, its stomatal density was much lower and some have speculated\nthat rising carbon dioxide levels might allow Ginkgo to expand its range from surviving\nonly where it is planted.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nGinkgo are extensively planted as a shade tree. It has an appealing form and grows well\nin a variety of habitats, including urban ones where pollution and asphalt produce an\nenvironment where many trees fare poorly. A significant, but not well explained, feature\nof the plant, is that it grows well when planted but does not establish itself on its own.\nMany workers feel that there are no \u2018naturally-occurring\u2019 ginkgos, i.e. that it is only found\nwhere it has been planted and its current existence is due solely to the fact that humans\nhave been planting them for the last 10,000 years, most of that time in China, but more\nrecently world-wide.\nThe \u2018fruits\u2019 (female cones) of ginkgo produce a foul smell (butyric acid) when ripening. In\nthe past the female trees were sometimes removed when they were old enough to produce\nfruit but modern horticulture has allowed plants to be cloned and most of the trees now\nplanted are male.\nThe leaves of ginkgo are thought by some to be an herbal medicine that improves brain\nfunction.

The group as a whole is extraordinarily\ndiverse in terms of their biology, interactions with other species and evolutionary history.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nBecause of certain \u2018prokaryotic\u2019 features associated\nwith their nucleus and DNA, the dinoflagellate group\nwas once were once thought to be a \u2018transitional\u2019\ngroup between prokaryotes and eukaryotes but work-\ners now believe that these features are \u2018 derived\u2019 (i.e.\nappeared after the group originated) and not \u2018ances-\ntral\u2019 (present in the original dinoflagellates). That is, it\nis thought that the dinoflagellates diverged from other\neukaryotes and then developed these \u2018prokaryotic\u2019 fea-\ntures. Modern treatments often lump the dinoflagel-\nlates with two other unicellular groups that are\ncompletely heterotrophic: the ciliates (including Para-\nmecium) and the ampicomplexans (mostly parasites,\nincluding Plasmodium, the causal organism for\nmalaria). There is evidence that the ancestor of all\nthese groups was in fact photosynthetic, the result of a secondary endosymbiotic event 632 | GONYAULAX: A DINOFLAGELLATE\nbetween a red algae and a heterotrophic eukaryote, but that photosynthetic ability was\nlost in all of these groups, only to be regained in some dinoflagellates by a another\nendosymbiotic event that apparently has occurred multiple times, with (photosynthetic)\ndiatoms, cryptomonads and green algae.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nDinoflagellates are unicellular and range tremendously in size, from 5 um to 1mm. They also\nvary tremendously in form although many are spherical with \u2018horns\u2019. Many have a com-\nplex boundary, called a \u2018theca\u2019 between it and the outside that consists of several large, cel-\nlulose plates enclosed in vesicles, just inside the outermost membrane. Most possess two\nflagellae, one long and one short and have a characteristic \u2018whirling\u2019 motion as a result of\nflagellar movement.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nMost reproduction is asexual and the sexual process has not been found in most of the\nmembers of this group. When there is sex the diploid cell quickly undergoes meiosis;\ntherefore finding the diploid cells is rare.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nDinoflagellates occur both as photoautotrophs and as heterotrophs. The heterotrophs\nmay be predatory (i.e. kill and consume other living things), parasitic (i.e. live in, and\nsometimes, but not always, kill its host) or saprophytes (feeding on dead organic matter).\nDinoflagellates also serve as the photosynthetic component for a number of symbiotic\nassociations, in particular in corals, and thereby allow these associations to be photoau-\ntotrophic.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nDinoflagellates are found primarily in marine systems but some are in fresh-water. A\nnumber of species produces a toxin which can kill fish and invertebrates and may kill GONYAULAX: A DINOFLAGELLATE | 633\nhumans if they eat organisms, in particular shellfish, that have consumed the dinoflagel-\nlates. Dinoflagellates sometimes have population spikes causing what are known as \u2018red\ntides\u2019, so named because of the of a red carotenoid pigment often present in the cells.\nDinoflagellates are also significant in producing the chemical dimethylsulfoniopropi-\nonate (DMSP), a chemical that is eaten by bacteria and is significant not only to their\nnutrition, providing carbon and reduced sulfur. As a consequence of bacteria eating\nDMSP, another chemical, dimethyl sulfide, is released and this chemical is thought to be\nhighly significant to global climate because it triggers cloud formation.\nGonyaulax has been used to study the biological clock \u2014 it is bioluminescent with a 24\nhour periodicity.

Thus most workers now describe two groups of prokaryotes, Archaea and\nEubacteria. Although initially thought to be representative of the most ancient forms of\nlife (hence the name Archaea) workers now believe that the Archaea were derived from\nEubacteria. Based on metabolic pathways and genes, it appears that and that eukaryotes\nand Archaea are more closely related than eukaryotes and Eubacteria.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nCells are rod-shaped and roughly 2-5 um in length with a single lipid bilayer membrane\nsurrounded by a glycoprotein cell wall. Archaea cell membranes are made of phospho-\nlipids that are distinct from those found in bacteria and eukaryotes. Halobacterium cells\nare flagellated and capable of moving towards a source of light, especially light in the in 636 | HALOBACTERIUM\nthe yellow-green, around 560 nm, which is where its photosynthetic pigment (bacteri-\norhodopsin, see below) has peak absorbance.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all prokaryotes, Halobacteria are not sexual but they are capable of exchanging genetic\nmaterial by other means. They reproduce by cell division but, like all Archaeons do not\nproduce endospores.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nHalobacteria are photoheterotrophs. Like other heterotrophs they need to eat (i.e. assimi-\nlate) organic compounds to provide themselves with material to grow, but they also use\nlight energy to generate ATP. In contrast, photosynthetic organisms are autotrophic: they\nmake food (carbohydrates) and then \u2018eat\u2019 some of it to make ATP and use the rest as\nbuilding material. Regular heterotrophs \u2018eat\u2019both to acquire material for growth and to\nobtain energy, usually via cellular respiration. . If Halobacteria are deprived of light they\nneed to eat more because they will behave like a \u2018normal\u2019 heterotroph, using the food they\neat both to make themselves bigger and also to provide for their energetic needs.\nThe pigment that interacts with light is bacteriorhodopsin, a form of rhodopsin, the same\npigment that our eyes use to see. In both instances light causes a conformational change HALOBACTERIUM | 637\nin the protein. In our eyes this causes a nerve impulse to be transmitted; in Halobacterium\nit causes protons to accumulate on one side of a membrane, and proton flow down the\ngradient that has been created allows ATP to be synthesized. Halobacterium also possesses\na second protein pigment, halorhodopsin, that can use light energy to pump chloride ions\ninto the cell, increasing the solute concentration and preventing excessive water loss.\nBBaacctteerriioorrhhooddooppssiinn iiss aa mmeemmbbrraannee--ssppaannnniinngg pprrootteeiinn tthhaatt ccaann aaccqquuiirree\npprroottoonnss iinn tthhee ccyyttoossooll,, cchhaannggee ccoonnffoorrmmaattiioonn dduuee ttoo tthhee aabbssoorrppttiioonn ooff\nlliigghhtt aanndd rreelleeaassee pprroottoonnss oonn tthhee oouuttssiiddee ooff tthhee mmeemmbbrraannee..

Halobacterium\ncan live, and indeed requires, salt concentrations far exceeding the tolerance levels of most\nother organisms. They can even survive in saturated brine solutions. Because of this, they\ncan actually be \u2018fossilized\u2019 in salt deposits and stay alive for thousands, perhaps millions\nof years. Tolerance of extreme conditions probably means reduced competition in such\nhabitats.\nAlthough many archaeons are extremophiles, not all are; and there certainly are\nextremophiles that are not archaeons (one you should be aware of is the bacterium,\nThermus aquaticus). Another non-archaeon that lives in high salt conditions is the uni-\ncellular green algae Dunaliella salina which can produce large quantities of the pigment\nbeta-carotene and at one time was once thought to be the source of red coloration in\nhypersaline lakes. Most workers now believe that archaeons like Halobacterium are what\nmake the lakes red, but that Dunaliella may be responsible in making flamingos pink, a\nresult of their consumption of brine shrimp that have feasted on the beta-carotene loaded\nDunaliella.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cHalobacterium\u201d on Cronodon.com\n\u25e6 https://cronodon.com/BioTech/Halobacterium.html\n\u2022 \u201cThe Immortal, Halophilic Superhero: Halobacterium Salinarum \u2013 A Long-\nlived Poly-extremophile\u201d by Terry J.

Other conifers do occur in the\neastern forests, on sites where they have been planted, or in specific habitats (higher ele-\nvations in the mountains, areas with sandy or boggy soils) , or early in a successional\nsequence where they are eliminated with time. Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) is\nfound in the Pacific northwest and generally occurs in coastal temperate rainforests.\nOther hemlock (Tsuga) species occur in Japan/China/Korea. HEMLOCK | 641\nDistribution of western hemlock. Distribution of eastern hemlock.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd pphhyyllooggeennyy\nHemlock is a gymnosperm, a seed producing plant that does not have flowers. Gym-\nnosperms are not considered monophyletic and therefore it is not a phylogenetic entity.\nThe four groups that used to be lumped as gymnosperms (conifers, ginkgo, cycads\nand gnetophytes) are no longer grouped together unless the largest seed bearing group,\nangiosperms, is included as well. Hemlocks are in the pine family (Pinaceae) of the conifer\nphylum (Coniferophyta); other members of the Pine family are pines, firs, spruces and\nlarch and other members of the Coniferophyta are junipers, redwoods and cedars. There\nare about ten species in the genus Tsuga.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nHemlocks are typical woody plants, with a main trunk capable of extensive secondary\ngrowth and reaching substantial girths and heights. Eastern hemlock can often reach 30\nm and western hemlock more than twice that height, making it one of the tallest tree\nspecies. These are long-lived organisms, with Eastern Hemlock reaching over 500 years in\nage and western Hemlocks over twice that age. 642 | HEMLOCK\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nHemlock produces seeds in small (~2 cm), woody cones that earlier are the site of meiosis\nand female gametophyte development, including the production of eggs. Male gameto-\nphytes (pollen) are produced in separate cones that are much smaller. Pollen is dispersed\nby the wind and completes its development inside the female cone, producing sperm that\nfertilize the egg. The seeds are small (1-2 mm), winged, and dispersed by the wind.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nHemlock is a typical photosynthetic autotroph. Western hemlock occurs in coastal ever-\ngreen rainforests in habitats with relatively mild winter temperatures and where being\nevergreen has a distinct advantage. Eastern hemlock is unusual in being an evergreen\nspecies in a forest that is dominated by deciduous trees. It may gain some advantage by\nbeing able to acquire carbon in the winter but often photosynthesis is limited by low tem-\nperatures and especially by reduced water transport when it is below freezing and water\ntransport is restricted. Both species are known for being extremely shade tolerant, mean-\ning that they can stay alive (have a positive carbon budget) in spite of low levels of light,\nthis would require low respiration rates.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nAn introduced insect species, the hemlock\nwooly adelgid(HWA), is causing signifi-\ncant mortality of eastern hemlocks, espe-\ncially in the southern part of its range.\nThe HWA exclusively feeds on hemlock\nspecies. Closely related to aphids, adelgids\nare sedentary insects that feed on phloem\nsap, using a stylet to penetrate phloem\nsieve tubes. They then acquire carbohydrates when the pressurized phloem sap is pushed\ninto the insect\u2019s body, similar to the way that pressurized capillaries of mammalian circu-\nlatory systems allow mosquitoes to acquire a blood meal. In neither case is the insect HEMLOCK | 643\n\u2018sucking\u2019 fluids, it is merely tapping a pressurized \u2018pipe\u2019. In the far east, where the HWA\nis native, its population are controlled by predatory insect species and there is hope that\nintroduction of these predators may help control the pest in North America.\nAlthough a common tree, the eastern hemlock is not commercially useful. Its wood has a\nnumber of features that make it ill-suited as lumber or pulp (for making paper). In con-\ntrast, the western hemlock is a highly desirable lumber species with considerable strength\nand a straight grain. Western hemlock pulp makes high quality paper. In the 18th and 19th\ncentury the bark of eastern hemlock was a source of tannins. Tannins are group of chem-\nicals that are important both to the plants that produce them and for humans utilizing\nthe plants. For plants, tannins are bitter tasting and deter feeding because of this. How-\never, if eaten, tannins can interact with digestive enzymes and thereby impede digestion.\nHerbivore avoidance of tannin containing plants may be a learned and/or evolved conse-\nquence of these effects and not simply a \u2018dislike\u2019 for the taste. To humans, tannins actually\nprovide a desirable bitterness to (at least some) humans and consequently are desirable\nat a certain level in tea, chocolate, wine and other consumables. Another use for tannins\nis the process of tanning leather, where the ability of tannins to interact with proteins,\nspecifically the collagen found in animal skin, a llows tanning to make animal hide more\nsupple and less prone to decay.\nGGaammooddeerrmmaa ttuussssllee\nSome fungi apparently like the taste of hemlock, Gamoderma tsugae, the hemlock varnish\nfungus, is distinctive because of its shiny, glossy surface. As the name implies, it grows (i.e. 644 | HEMLOCK\neats) hemlocks, although it occasionally is found on other conifers. Gamoderma tsugae is\nclosely related to Gamoderma lucidum, known as Lingzhi (Ling Chih) in China and Reishi\nin Japan which is highly valued medicinally.\nFurther Reading\n\u2022 \u201cTannins\u201d by the US Forest Service\n\u25e6 https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/ethnobotany/tannins.shtml\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Henry\u2019s Woods \u00a9 Nicholas A.

They represent a\nvery small remnant, only a single genus with less\nthat 100 species, of a group that in the Paleozoic\nwas a much more conspicuous component of the\nearth\u2019s flora. From 100 million years, ending 250\nmillion years ago, this group was a dominant in\nterrestrial habitats world wide and the group is\nresponsible for much of our coal and oil deposits.\nThey are common in most of the United States,\nsometimes as a roadside weed or in wet habitats.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nThe genus traditionally had been put in a phylum all by itself but more recent treatments\nlump the horsetails in the fern phylum (Pterophyta), usually putting them in an order\n(Equisetales) distinct from other fern groups. When treated this way, the orders of the\nPterophyta diverged in the late Paleozoic era. Whether you consider horsetails to be a\nphylum by themselves or an order within the Pterophyta, they still are very easy to recog-\nnize because of their distinct structure.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nHorsetails have a very distinctive form\u2013they have jointed stems with small and inconspic-\nuous leaves that appear as scales at the base of each section of stem. The stems are hol-\nlow and ribbed. The successive sections of stem get shorter and shorter, reminiscent of 646 | HORSETAILS, THE GENUS EQUISETUM\na logarithmic scale and there is a claim (I haven\u2019t been able to verify this) that the plant\nwas an inspiration to John Napier to invent logarithms. Napier invented logarithms in\nthe 16th century to make calculations easier (many biology students don\u2019t believe that\nlogarithms make calculations easier!!). The stems sometimes have whorled branches (in\nwhich case they look a bit like a horse\u2019s tail) but sometimes don\u2019t (in which case they\nreally do not look at all like a horse\u2019s tail!). Horsetails have extensive underground hori-\nzontal stems (rhizomes) off of which emerge roots and vertical above ground stems. The\ncommonly seen plant is a sporophyte that produces spores in a terminal cone or strobilis.\nSome species are dimorphic, with vegetative stems that are green and photosynthetic but\nproduce no spore-producing strobili, and fertile stems that are brown (no chlorophyll, no\nphotosynthesis) but do produce strobili and thus are only involved in reproduction. Fossil\nmembers of the group had secondary growth and grew up to 18 m in height, with stems\na half a meter across. These plants were significant components in the deposits that yield\ncoal and oil.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all plants, Equisetum exhibits alternation of generations. They have a easily visible\nsporophyte and hard-to-find gametophyte. Spores are produced in \u2018cones\u2019, terminal por-\ntions of stems where certain cells undergo meiosis to produce a \u2018tetrad\u2019 of four spores.\nThe spores have extensions of the cell wall called elaters that move in response to\nhumidity changes and provide some motility to the spores (see video below). The spores\ngerminate and produce haploid gametophytes that are bisexual (thus the plants are\nhomosporous, producing only one type of spore). Equisetum gametophytes are small,\nuncommon produce archegonia, that produce eggs, and antheridia, that release haploid,\nflagellated sperm that are chemically attracted to the archegonia and fertilize the eggs,\nforming a zygote that grows into a diploid sporophyte that soon overgrows the gameto-\nphyte. HORSETAILS, THE GENUS EQUISETUM | 647\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nEquiesetum (both the sporophyte and\ngametophyte) is a typical photoautotroph,\nusing the energy of sunlight to synthesize\ncarbohydrates from carbon dioxide and\nwater and then using the carbohydrates as\nan energy source in cellular respiration\nand as building material to synthesize a\nvariety of biomolecules. Note that for\ndimorphic species the spore bearing stems\nare photosynthetic only briefly and are\n\u2018fed\u2019 by the photosynthetic branches for\nmost of their existence.

The zygote is\nformed when the egg, produced by the female gametophyte, is fertilized by a sperm\nnucleus produced by the male gametophyte (pollen). Pollen is produced in minute (1-3\nmm) male cones. The zygote develops into a new sporophyte embryo that is packaged\ninside a seed, a mature (fully developed) ovule. Junipers produce \u2018berries\u2019 that are a good\nexample of convergent evolution. Technically, berries are fruits and fruits are only pro-\nduced by flowering plants as a result of development of the ovary of the flower following\nfertilization. In many cases fruits have characteristics (rewards) that attract frugivores to\ncome and eat the fruit and subsequently disperse the seed, present in the fruit, by defe-\ncating somewhere distant from the plant where the fruit was collected. Juniper \u2018berries\u2019\nare actually cones, like those of pine and hemlock, but the cone scales are not woody but 652 | JUNIPER\nare thick, fleshy and aromatic and attract frugivores who disperse the seeds.

Most modern treatments do not elevate this group to\nthe phylum level but combine it with other \u2018heterokonts\u2019, a group defined by having two\ncharacteristic flagella, one longer than the other. The heterokonts (sometimes called the\nStramenopiles) also includes diatoms and the heterotrophic water molds (Oomycota).\nThe pigmentation of photosynthetic stramenopiles is similar to that of the haptophytes\nlike coccolithophores and the cryptophytes. This may not represent a common phylogeny 656 | KELP: LAMINARIA, A BROWN ALGAE\nbut instead that all three groups separately became photosynthetic by acquiring the same\nphotosynthetic endosymbiont. The photosynthetic members of these groups are thought\nto have been produced by secondary endosymbiosis and their chloroplasts have four\nmembranes (see discussion in the article on diatoms).\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nTypical of most brown algae Laminaria is truly multicellular, and has three distinct mul-\nticellular organs: a holdfast, that attaches the organism to a substrate, a broad flat blade\nthat carries out the bulk of photosynthesis, and a stipe (stalk) that connects the blade to\nthe holdfast and is long enough to allow the blade to obtain light. Many brown algae also\nhave \u2018floats\u2019, air filled bladders that cause the blade to be elevated. Brown algae have trans-\nport systems that allow photosynthate from the blade to be distributed throughout the\nplant.\nBBrroowwnn aallggaaee,, LLaammiinnaarriiaa KELP: LAMINARIA, A BROWN ALGAE | 657\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nMost brown algae are sexual and exhibit alternation of generations.

Another\nbrown algae, rockweed (Fucus), shows a life cycle like humans, with no alternation of gen-\nerations and where the only haploid cells are gametes. Gametes are sometimes distinct\nfrom one another (egg and sperm) and sometimes all look the same (isogametes).

Lichens are communities, assemblages of\norganisms and communities are generally not given genus and species names and are gen- 660 | LUNGWORT LICHEN (LOBARIA PUMONARIA)\nerally not considered to be organisms. But the definition of \u2018organism\u2019 is not rigid (see\nChapter 1) and certainly lichens can be considered organisms. The fact that they can be\ngiven scientific names attests to this. Like \u2018regular\u2019 organisms, they are distinct in time\nand space. The boundary between the lichen and its environment is very evident and one\ncould follow its development, if you live a long time and are patient, from its initiation\nto its demise. Traditionally, lichens were considered to have two components: a photo-\nbiont, either a unicellular green algae or a cyanobacterium (bluegreen algae) and a fungus.\nRecent work has ind icated that lichens also contain another fungus, one that is unicel-\nlular fungus i.e., a yeast. And some lichens, including lungwort have two photobionts,\nmeaning that it is a community of at least four organisms.\nTaxonomy and Phylogeny\nLichens are able to be classified because of characteristic form, color and structure. While\neach component of the lichen may have an evolutionary history (phylogeny), it would be\ndifficult to track the phylogeny of the composite organism. Lichens are generally classified\non the basis of their fungal component but the same fungus can produce marked different\nstructures depending upon its algal symbiont and other features. Thus although lichens\ncan be classified based on form (\u2018looks\u2019, including chemical \u2018looks\u2019)) but this does not pin\ndown the entity to specific components.\nStructure\nLichens are typically grouped (see this the US Forest Service site for images) as \u2018foliose\n\u2019\u2014 having flattened leaf-like features (like lungwort), \u2018fruticose \u2019\u2014 having extensions that\nare typically round and stem-like, not leaf like, and \u2018crustose\u2019\u2014 forming a crust, typically\nover a rock. Especially in foliose and crustose lichens there is an upper and lower layer\nof dense fungal hyphae all glued tightly together, with a middle layer where the fungal\nhyphae are more loosely arranged and where the photobiont is found. The fungal com-\nponent of most lichens is an ascomycete fungus and commonly one can find cup-shaped\napothecia, a structure associated with the sexual reproduction of ascomycetes (aka cup-\nfungi) on the lichen. The algal component is unicellular and usually a cyanobacterium or\na green algae. Lichens are often very colorful with the coloration generally being deter-\nmined by the photobiont.

The fungal\ncomponent of the lichen is capable of sexual reproduction, as evidenced by the produc-\ntion of ascocarps, but to recreate the lichen requires the acquisition of the photobiont. 662 | LUNGWORT LICHEN (LOBARIA PUMONARIA)\nMatter and energy\nThe lichen can be considered a photosyn-\nthetic autotroph, using sunlight to cap-\nture carbon dioxide and form\ncarbohydrates that are then used (1) struc-\nturally to make more lichen (both the\nphotobiont and the fungus) and used (2)\nenergetically to power the metabolism of\nboth the photobiont and the fungus.

In the past, the three\ngroups of non-vascular plants (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) were grouped together\ninto some taxonomic entity, often a phylum, but recent studies have supported placing\nthe three groups into three separate phyl a, reflecting a view that the liverworts, mosses\nand hornworts are not obviously connected with each other, other than all being plants.\nThe 9000 species of liverworts are usually separated into three groups, one of which con-\ntains Marchantia and other \u2018complex thalloid \u2018forms, described below. MARCHANTIA: THALLOID LIVERWORT | 665\nSSttrruuccttuurree\n(Gametophyte)\u2014Of all the plant groups, the liverworts show the most diversity in\nform. While some liverworts bear a resemblance to mosses, having a stem axis with\nappendages (\u2018leaves\u2019), Marchantia is representative of a group of liverworts described\nas having \u2018complex thalloid\u2019 structure, consisting of a flattened body (a thallus) that\ngenerally spreads across the ground surface and is differentiated into a top and bot-\ntom. Marchantia is characterized by repeated branching into two parts. The thallus has\nmultiple layers of cells. The top layer has permanently open pores (visible to the naked\neye as minute dots) that allow for carbon dioxide entry. Below this skin (dermal) layer\nlies a layer of chlorophyll containing cells that are loosely arranged with lots of air space\nto allow for the diffusion of carbon dioxide. Below this is a (usually) thicker layer of cells\nthat lack chlorophyll, and finally the lower skin (epidermis) which has multicellular fish-\nscale like structures that help attach the liverwort to the substrate, and also rhizoids, cells\nwith thread like extensions that also attach the liverwort to a substrate. The sporophyte\nis hard to find, being small (less than 1 mm) and imbedded on the underside of archego-\nniophores (see below).\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike mosses, liverworts show alternation of generations with a \u2018dominant\u2019 gametophyte\n(dominant = more visible, longer lasting). Under the appropriate conditions the gameto-\nphyte of Marchantia (and some other liverworts) grows two types of vertically oriented,\numbrella/mushroom shaped structures: antheridiophores and archegoniophores, both\nroughly 1 cm in height. The antheridiophores produce male structures that produce\nsperm on the upper surface of the umbrella.\nThe archegoniophores, which are like umbrellas that lack the webbing between ribs pro-\nduce female structures, archegonia, on the underside of the ribs.\nOn the underside of the female structures are produced flask-shaped archegonia, at the\nbase of which is a single egg. When mature, an opening (\u2018canal\u2019) develops from the egg to\nthe tip of the archegonia, providing a route for the sperm to access the egg and allowing\nfor fertilization. After fertilization a small (barely visible to the naked eye) sporophyte is\nproduced, embedded in the tissue that produced the egg.

Its leaves look more like\na four-leaf clovers than the typical fern\nleaf. There are a number of species of Mar-\nsilea and it is common throughout tem-\nperate and subtropical regions of the\nworld, usually growing in shallow water\nwith a stem rooted to the bottom and\nleaves that extend up and float on the sur-\nface. In North America M. quadrifoliata is\nconsidered a weed, although it is commonly grown intentionally in water gardens. It is\nsometimes found emerging from moist soil as well.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy aanndd ttaaxxoonnoommyy\nMarsilea is in a group (generally considered an order \u2014 the Salviniales) that is known as\n\u2018water ferns\u2019 in the Phylum Pterophyta (ferns), the group that includes most seedless vas-\ncular plants (the other group of seedless vascular plants are the clubmoss group, Lycopo-\ndiophyta). Some water ferns, including mosquito fern and azolla, are floating aquatic\nspecies, while Marsilea is rooted and can tolerate seasonally dry conditions.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nMarsilea produces a horizontally running stem across the surface of the substrate (which\nmay be underwater). Like sensitive fern and some of the horsetails, water fern is dimor-\nphic and the horizontal stem produces two types of leaves, green, photosynthetic leaves\nand non-photosynthetic leaves associated with reproduction. The vegetative leaves look MARSILEA: THE 4-LEAF CLOVER FERN | 671\nlike shamrocks. These elongate and make it to the surface of the water or, if growing on\nmoist soil, grow to a height of ~ 10 cm. A second type of leaf is much smaller, with a\nshorter petiole ending in a sporocarp, a brown circular seed-like structure that dries out\ncompletely.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all plants, Marsilea alternates between a haploid and diploid stage. And like all vas-\ncular plants, it is the diploid, spore producing, stage that is most visible. The sporocarp\nis seed-like in looks and behavior, but developmentally is something very different. The\nsporocarp is a highly modified spore-bearing leaf that develops to a certain point and\nthen becomes dormant and dries out and is therefore capable of being dispersed. Eventu-\nally, when the hard coating of the sporocarp becomes scarred, either by mechanical forces\n(abrasion) or by biotic forces (decomposition), water can enter and hydrate the spore\nbearing leaf, which then emerges from the sporocarp. The leaf looks nothing like a regular\nleaf, it is very small and non-photosynthetic, but bears two types of sporangia, produc-\ning two types of spores: larger spores (megaspores) that develop into female gametophytes\ninside the spore case (endosporically) and smaller spores that release flagellated sperm.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nMarsilea sporophytes are photosynthetic autotrophs. The gametophytes live solely off\nmaterial from the sporophyte incorporated in the mega and microspores.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nMarsilea sporocarps (the seed-like structures) are eaten by aboriginal Australians,\nalthough proper preparation is important. The plant produces an enzyme, thiaminase,\nthat breaks down vitamin B1 and if this enzyme is not de-activated vitamin B1 deficiency\nand death can result. This same enzyme is also found in bracken fern, some horsetails and\nalso in carp and goldfish. 672 | MARSILEA: THE 4-LEAF CLOVER FERN\nLLiiffee ccyyccllee ooff MMaarrssiilleeaa:: AA--ssppoorroopphhyyttee ppllaanntt,, wwiitthh aa vveeggeettaattiivvee aanndd aa rreepprroodduuccttiivvee lleeaavveess\n((ssppoorrooccaarrpp))..

Like the nitrifying bacteria,\nmethanogens are a group that are united by what they do rather than by their phylogeny.\nAs the name implies, methanogens make methane. This is significant for multiiple rea-\nsons: methane can be burned (oxidized) and is the main component of \u2018biogas\u2019 (made from\nsewage) and also \u2019natural gas\u2019 (mined from underground deposits) that are used industri-\nally. Methane is also a \u2019greenhouse gas\u2019 impacting global energy budgets.\nMethane gas generated by a landfill is recovered, treated and piped to Tucson Electric\nPower where it is used to generate electricity. METHANOGENS: ARCHAEA WITH INTERESTING CHEMISTRY | 675\nMethanogens are significant biologically because of their role in ruminant digestion,\nallowing herbivores to acquire more nutrition from the food that they eat. More generally\nthey allow organic material to be more fully \u2018digested\u2019 i.e. broken down, in land fills and\nswamps, ultimately allowing the recycling of nutrients. Finally, methagens are included\nhere because of their unique abilities and what they can teach students about energy and\norganisms.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nAll methanogens are archaea, beyond that they don\u2019t fall into a phylogenetic entity. And,\nas discussed below, they differ substantially in their lifestyle, albeit unified by producing\nmethane. Many methanogens are extremophiles, living under extreme conditions of heat,\ncold and acidity.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nMethanogens are not distinguished by structural features. The are \u2018typical\u2019 archaea in\ntheir shape and internal composition.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd EEnneerrggyy ((sseeee CChhaapptteerr 2211))\nOrganisms are constructed of \u2018reduced carbon compounds\u2019, primarily carbohydrates, and\nit is generally the case that organisms, both autotrophs and heterotrophs, obtain energy\nin the process of cellular respiration whereby reduced carbon compounds are oxidized to\ncarbon dioxide. This reaction is energetically \u2018downhill\u2019, i.e. thermodynamically favored,\nand the usual assumption is that reduced carbon compounds \u2018have more useful energy\u2019\nthan carbon dioxide and that this energy is what allows ATP production. Given this\nassumption the reverse reaction by methanogens, converting carbon dioxide to methane\n(a reduced carbon compound) would seem to be energetically unfavorable. But it is\nimportant to look closely at the overall reaction of cellular respiration:\nreduced carbon compound + oxygen\u2014>water + carbon dioxide 676 | METHANOGENS: ARCHAEA WITH INTERESTING CHEMISTRY\nThe presence of oxygen is critical, not just to the reaction (as a reagent) but also to\nthe description/assumption that reduced carbon compounds \u2018have energy\u2019. They \u2018have\nenergy\u2019 only when oxygen (or some other oxidizing agent, e.g. nitrate) is present. In the\nabsence of oxygen and with an abundance of hydrogen it turns out that reduced carbon\ncompounds are now energetically \u2018downhill\u2019 of carbon dioxide and therefore organisms\ncan take advantage of this by converting carbon dioxide to methane and obtaining energy\n(ATP) in the process.\nFor some methanogens the significance of the reaction is simply the ATP obtained\nthat can then be used metabolically in a variety of ways. Like Halobacterium, some\nmethanogens are heterotrophs for carbon but can obtain energy without oxidizing carbo-\nhydrates. While Halobacterium uses light energy to make ATP and might be considered\na \u2018photoenergetic heterotroph, these methanogens might be called chemoenergetic het-\nerotrophs.\nOther methanogens are like the nitrifying bacteria, \u2018chemoenergetic autotrophs\u2019\n(chemosynthetic autotrophs), autotrophs like plants that make food and then eat them-\nselves, but not using the energy of sunlight for energy, instead utilizing energy obtained\nfrom chemicals in their environment (CO and H ).\n2 2\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nMethanogens are common in a variety of habitats where organic matter has accumulated\nand oxygen is absent (because it has been utilized by heterotrophs): swamps, landfills, the\nstomachs of ruminants. In these habitats methanogen action is important to other organ-\nisms that are present because it consumes hydrogen, whose build-up retards the chemi-\ncal reactions of decomposition. Methanogen activity thus allows the continued breaking\ndown organic material. In cow\u2019s stomachs this results in the production of materials that\nthe cow can absorb and utilize. In swamps it allows for the recycling of nutrients. In both\nplaces the methane leaks into the atmosphere.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Pumping station \u00a9 Gene Spesard is licensed under a CC BY (Attribution) license\n\u2022 Cow \u00a9 Kim Hansen is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license METHANOGENS: ARCHAEA WITH INTERESTING CHEMISTRY | 677 MOLDS: UBIQUITOUS FUNGI\nThe common molds Aspergillus and Penicillium are of tremendous importance to human\nendeavors for both positive and negative reasons.\nBoth are \u2018spoilers\u2019 that can destroy crops before harvest or, more commonly, during stor-\nage. They also can spoil all sorts of non-food items: leather, clothing, shoes, carpeting,\npaintings, etc.. Members of both genera produce chemicals that are toxins to other\nspecies, including humans. Most well known of such chemicals is the antibiotic penicillin,\nwhich is a toxin to many bacteria but is not toxic to (most) humans. Another chemical\nproduced by molds is aflatoxin, which doesn\u2019t affect bacteria but is a toxin and a carcino-\ngen in mammals, including humans.

Consequently, fungi\nlacking sexual stages could not be categorized and were put into a category of their own\ncalled the Deuteromycetes or the Fungi Imperfecti. With the use of molecular character-\nistics these fungi can now be put into phylogenetic categories, and both Aspergillus and\nPenicillium have been put in the same family in the Ascomycete phylum.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nAs Ascomycetes, both genera are septate fungi that have a typical filamentous structure\nof hyphae that form mycelia. The relatively few members that reproduce sexually (usually\nonly rarely) produce small spherical closed fruiting bodies called cleistothecia.

This allows them to grow in drier situations than other fungi.\nAdditionally, some species can tolerate growth on media that have a high solute content,\ne.g. the high sugar levels on jams and jellies (high sugar contents generally act as preser-\nvatives because many bacteria and fungi cannot tolerate the \u2018dry\u2019 conditions that result\nfrom high solute levels). Molds might be considered \u2018weedy\u2019 fungi, because they grow on\na wide variety of materials, in contrast to many fungal species that are much more dis-\ncriminating in terms of where they will grow and what they will eat. However, weeds are\noften poor competitors (Chapter 29) yet some species of Penicillium compete very well, at\nleast with bacteria, because they produce a chemical (penicillin) that deters the growth of\nmany bacteria that might be competing for the same food source.\nAs mentioned above, both genera are used extensively in the production of foods and bev-\nerages. While Penicillium is mostly associated with the production of cheeses, Aspergillus is\nused to make sake (rice wine), soy sauce and miso.

They are highly significant to the global nitrogen cycle and to the existence of plants.\nThey are autotrophs (they eat themselves) and they make \u2018food \u2018(carbohydrates) by utiliz-\ning energy from chemicals rather than from light as photosynthetic autotrophs do.\nTaxonomy and Phylogeny\nNitrifying bacteria are not unified by phylogeny and the taxonomic entity \u2018nitrifying\nbacteria\u2019 is totally artificial. The group includes bacteria from several unrelated groups\nand also includes some archaea (i.e. organisms that are not bacteria). The group includes\norganisms that: (1) convert ammonia to nitrite, (2) convert nitrite to nitrate and (3)\nrecently discovered organisms that can do both reactions, converting ammonia to nitrate.\nStructure\nConsistent with their phylogenetic diversity, these bacteria exist in a variety of forms:\nrods, spheres and spirals. Many have extensive internal membrane systems that probably\nare significant to the biochemistry they accomplish. 684 | NITRIFYING BACTERIA: CHEMOENERGETIC AUTOTROPHS AND HETEROTROPHS\nMatter and Energy\nMost organisms obtain energy through cellular respiration, a series of biochemical reac-\ntions that remove hydrogens from carbohydrates (oxidizing them) and transfer them to\noxygen, forming water. In the process, the energy from carbohydrates is transferred to\nATP. One can think of ammonia as \u2018food\u2019, comparable to carbohydrates in being a chem-\nical that can be oxidized in a process that allows its energy to be \u2018captured\u2019. Some nitrify-\ning bacteria are \u2018ammonia oxidizing bacteria\u2019 and they obtain energy as the ammonia is\noxidized to nitrite (NO \u2013).\n2\nIn a similar process, the nitrite (NO \u2013) formed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria can be\n2\nfurther oxidized by \u2018nitrite oxidizing bacteria\u2019, converting the nitrite (NO \u2013) to nitrate\n2\n(NO \u2013).\n3\nEach of these groups have members that can do more than just acquire energy in the\nform of ATP as they carry out these oxidations. Both These reactions can also be part of\na process that allows carbohydrates to be formed from carbon dioxide. Recall that this\nhappens in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis where NADPH (a source of electrons, i.e.\nreducing power) and ATP are inputs in a process that reduces carbon dioxide, forming\ncarbohydrates. In nitrifying bacteria the net effect of the process is a transfer of electrons\nfrom either ammonia or nitrite to CO :\n2\nammonia + CO \u2014-> NO \u2013 + (CH O) (ammonia oxidizers)\n2 2 2 n\nNO \u2013 + CO \u2014-> NO \u2013 + (CH O) (nitrite oxidizers)\n2 2 3 2 n\nammonia + CO \u2014-> NO \u2013 + (CH O) (comammox)\n2 3 2 n\nOrganisms that carry out these reactions are considered autotrophs because they eat self-\nmade food and they could be called \u2018chemoenergetic autotrophs\u2019 because they utilize\nchemical energy to make their on food (similarly plants could be considered \u2018photoener-\ngetic autotrophs\u2019). Other organisms in these groups do not make their own food but sim-\nply use ammonia and nitrite as a food source to get energy.

NITRIFYING BACTERIA: CHEMOENERGETIC AUTOTROPHS AND HETEROTROPHS | 685\nInteractions\nNitrifying bacteria are extremely important to all vascular plants by providing the pre-\nferred form of nitrogen (nitrate) to the soil and allowing nitrogen to cycle rapidly from\nplants to heterotrophs to nitrifying bacteria and back to plants (Chapter 22).\nNitrifying bacteria conserve nitrogen in the soil because ammonia is volatile and escapes\nto the atmosphere, although in acid soils it gets protonated to ammonium (NH +) that is\n4\nnot volatile.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Nutrient cycles NOSTOC: THE SMALLEST\nMULTICELLULAR ORGANISM\nFFiillaammeennttss ooff NNoossttoocc iimmbbeeddddeedd iinn aa ggeellaattiinnoouuss ppoollyyssaacccchhaarriiddee..\nEEnnllaarrggeedd hheetteerrooccyysstt cceellllss aarree ffrreeqquueennttllyy pprreesseenntt..\nNostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria that is common in a variety of habitats: soil, ponds and\ngrowing on the surface of rocks and soil if they are kept moist. It also lives symbioti-\ncally inside of other organisms. Because of its ability to metabolize nitrogen (see below)\nit can be significant to ecosystems and to the organisms it associates with. As discussed\nin Chapter 5 it might be considered multicellular because it has multiple cell types that\ncommunicate and cooperate with each other.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nNostoc is in the group with the common name \u2018blue-green algae\u2019, a group often called\ncyanobacteria. In a five-kingdom classification they are in the Kingdom Monera, Phylum NOSTOC: THE SMALLEST MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM | 687\nCyanobacteria. In other classification systems they may be put in Domain Eubacteria,\nKingdom Bacteria, Phylum Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are thought to be the endosym-\nbiont that became the chloroplast of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nCyanobacteria occur in a number of forms: single cells, filaments and groups of cells in a\nvariety of colonial shapes. Nostoc are filamentous with roughly spherical cells. In addition\nto the normal cells, they also produce two larger specialized cell types: heterocysts, which\nare cells specialized to fix nitrogen; and akinetes, which are a type of spore that is resistant\nto environmental extremes. Cyanobacteria, like gram negative bacteria, have a layer of\npeptidoglycan sandwiched between and inner and outer membrane. However, the pep-\ntidoglycan layer is much thicker in cyanobacteria than typical gram negative bacteria.\nNostoc typically produces a large amount of polysaccharide mucilage that forms a sheath\naround the filaments and occasionally form hollow balls and other amorphous shapes that\nare up to several cm in size.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all bacteria, Nostoc are not sexual but they are capable of exchanging genetic material\nby other means.

Although water molds exhibit a\nfilamentous structure like fungi, the cell walls are composed of cellulose, not chitin as is\nfound in fungi. The filaments explore the habitat (which is sometimes water and some-\ntimes the inner part of other organisms) and obtain nutrients; in the case of Phytophthora,\nthe habitat is the inside of potato leaves or potato tubers\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nPhytophthora can spread very rapid in moist weather using mobile zoospores, flagellated\ncells that can swim through the water. Although they are not long distance swimmers,\nmovement of water by splashing, or by the wind and animals walking through vegetation,\ncan aid in their dispersal. Phytophthora also reproduces sexually, producing large, immo-\nbile eggs and smaller, mobile sperm. Unlike the fungi, the typical (i.e. most commonly\nencountered) cell of a water mold is diploid.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd EEnneerrggyy\nPhytophthora is a typical heterotroph, needing to find organic material as a source of mat-\nter and energy. For part of its life, Phytophthora is what is known as a \u2018biotroph\u2019 which\nmeans that it associates with living cells and is able to acquire matter (sugars, amino\nacids) from them using a structure called an haustorium, a structure that penetrates the\ncell wall, associates with the host cell membrane and is able to induce materials to move\nfrom the cytosol of the host plant to the cytosol of the parasite. With time, this drain on\nplant nutrients can kill the host plant cells and the fungus necessarily shifts from being a\nbiotroph, to a necrotroph, an organism that kills its food and then eats it, similar to killer\nwhales, lions and spiders. Significant to researchers is the fact that biotrophs are impossi-\nble to culture without living plant cells, i.e. you cannot simply have a medium with \u2018good\nstuff\u2019, like sugars and amino acids, and culture Phytophthora on it.

Most pines are distinct from other evergreens by the fact that\ntheir needles are longer, often 10 cm long or more, and they almost always occur in clus-\nters (bundles), typically in groups of two, three or five with the number of needles per\ngroup being a useful identification aid.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nPines belong to a distinct phylogenetic entity, the conifers, a group that is usually placed\nat the phylum level (Pinophyta). They have vascular tissue and produce seeds but do\nnot produce flowers. Sometimes conifers and the other seed plants without flowers (e.g.\ncycads and ginkgo) are grouped as gymnosperms but most workers do NOT consider this 706 | PINUS: PINE TREES\nto be a sound phylogenetic entity, i.e. they are not a group unified by their evolutionary\nhistory. Conifers are by far the most commonly encountered gymnosperm and pines (the\ngenus Pinus) are probably the most frequently encountered conifer. They are the largest\ngenus within the phylum, containing over 100 of the approximately 600 species in the\ngroup.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nAlmost all pines are typical woody trees (a\nfew might be considered large shrubs)\nwith a branched, dendritic form that\nthrough time and with secondary growth\nproduces the typical form that we recog-\nnize as trees. While some pines and most\nother conifers (spruces, firs and douglas\nfir) produce a \u2018Christmas tree\u2019 form, with triangular crowns that are usually quite steep,\npines often have a broader base and less steep sides.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nPines reproduce by seed, a multigenerational unit, which in the case of conifers contains\nboth an embryo and the female gametophyte that produced the egg that was fertilized to\nform the zygote that grew into the embryo. Both these entities are packaged in a seed coat\nconstructed of cells derived from the tree that produced the cone. Significant to the story\nis that pines, like ferns and mosses and also like wheat and aspen, do produce spores, i.e.\nseeds do NOT replace spores. Most species of pines have seeds that are winged and dis-\npersed by the wind, but a few species have adapted to dispersal by birds (see below). PINUS: PINE TREES | 707\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nPines are typical photosynthetic\nautotrophs, acquiring carbon dioxide\nfrom the air and converting it into carbo-\nhydrates to be converted back to carbon\ndioxide in cellular respiration (yielding\nATP) or to be used to synthesize biomole-\ncules. The shape of of conifer leaves (cylin-\ndrical), coupled with a thick cuticle reduces water loss but also slows carbon dioxide\nacquisition when compared to a broad-leafed plant with a much greater surface area to\nvolume ratio and thinner cuticles. In spite of the fact that individual leaves of pines and\nmost other conifers have a much smaller surface area than broad-leaved plants, the total\nleaf area per branch may exceed that of broad-leaved plants because there often are lots of\nneedles. Two other features are significant to the matter and energy relations of pines\n(and other evergreen conifers): (1) their evergreen life-style allows for year-round photo-\nsynthesis if conditions are appropriate, (2) leaves with longer lifespans are potentially ben-\neficial to nutrient status because absorbed nutrients have a longer residence time in the\nplant.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nWWiitthh cclliimmaattee::\nPines are primarily distributed in the northern hemisphere, and primarily occur at lati-\ntudes north of the tropics. They are particularly abundant in mountain habitats, as are\nother conifers. Many are tolerant of extreme cold and can live at upper elevations (e.g.\nlodgepole pine in the western US, Swiss pine in the Alps). As a group they are also toler-\nant of dry conditions, in particular seasonally dry conditions.

All these pines have features that actually promote fire, in particular their\nneedles are flammable and they also have behaviors and anatomy that allow them to tol-\nerate fire.

Some mosses also can reproduce asexually by producing\ngroups of cells (gemmae) that break off and can be dispersed, but these are not found\nin Polytrichium. In Polytrichum, only one sporophyte is produced for each female gameto-\nphyte. In some other mosses a single gametophyte may produce a several sporophytes but\nfor all mosses it is the sporophyte generation does the bulk of the reproduction, produc-\ning many, many spores. Of even more significance, the production of spores is what allows\nthe moss to spread to new areas, i.e. performs a dispersal function.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd EEnneerrggyy\nHairy cap moss is a photosynthetic autotroph, it makes food (carbohydrate) through the\nprocess of photosynthesis and then uses this carbohydrate both as a material to make bio-\nmolecules and also to provide energy for metabolic activities. For the gametophyte, this\nis true throughout its existence. The sporophyte is usually only photosynthetic during its\nperiod of growth, if at all, and often loses its chlorophyll, and thus its ability to feed itself,\nas it matures, becoming dependent upon the gametophyte that it is growing out of for its\nfood.\nMineral nutrition of mosses is different from that of vascular plants whose roots obtain\nnutrients from the soil solution. The rhizoids of mosses are limited in extent and lack\nthe ability of transporting nutrients to the above ground portion because they specialized\ncells for transport. Most of the nutrients obtained by mosses probably comes through the\nleaves of the gametophytes that provide substantial surface area and, unlike the leaves of\nvascular plants, are generally not coated with a waterproof cuticle that retards absorption\nof water or dissolved solutes. The nutrients in the solution surrounding the leaves are pro- POLYTRICHIUM: HAIRY CAP MOSS | 715\nvided by dust particles blown in the wind, solutes dissolved in precipitation and solutes\nadded to precipitation as it flows down the trees and shrubs in the forest canopy (if there\nis one), as well as solutes that may be carried up with capillary water from the substrate\nthat the moss is growing on. Sporophytes of mosses lack leaves and are not in contact with\nthe soil and thus probably obtain all their nutrients from the gametophyte that they grow\nout of.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nMosses are very common in a variety of habitats and are particular significant in some of\nthem (e.g. Sphagnum moss in bogs). They are rarely eaten extensively and generally (with\nthe significant exception of Sphagnum) produce very little biomass compared to vascular\nplants, thus their contribution to the trophic structure of most ecosystems is slight. How-\never, they do provide habitat for a number of small invertebrates (see the article on tardi-\ngrades linked below), they can sequester nutrients, including carbon, and are often very\nimportant in soil formation on sites that previously have lacked a soil, i.e. in primary suc-\ncession.\nFurther Reading\n\u2022 Great book on mosses.\n\u25e6 Gathering Moss by Robin Wall Kimmerer ISBN 0879714993\n\u2022 General information at Wikipedia.\n\u25e6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss\n\u2022 Bryophyte Ecology by Janice Glime.

While cottonwoods, like P. del-\ntoides and P. fremontii are typically found along streams and rivers, aspens like P. tremuloides\nand P. grandidentata are found in a variety of upland habitats, often forming monotypic\nstands because they grow clonally (see below).\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nPopulus is a genus of flowering plants in\nthe willow family with around 25 species,\nmany of which are familiar and are com-\nmonly seen. The willow family is a taxo-\nnomic grouping that used to be small\n(three genera), but recent studies using\nmolecular information have enlarged the\nfamily greatly (56 genera) by merging it\nwith several other families. Although the\ngroup was once thought to be primitive, 718 | POPULUS\nbased on floral characteristics, including the fact that most are wind-pollinated, most\nplant taxonomists now consider the family to be of relatively recent origin.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nMost members of this genus are fast-\ngrowing and relatively short-lived trees.\nThey exhibit typical tree-like above-\nground form but are relatively unusual\nbecause of their below-ground behavior,\nproducing underground stems (rhizomes)\nthat spread horizontally below ground and sporadically produce vertical shoots that form\nnew trees. As a consequence, several members of the genus (especially aspens) are typically\nfound as clones, stands of genetically identical individuals all connected (or previously\nconnected) by below-ground structures. Some other trees that behave similarly are black\nlocust and beech. This kind of growth pattern with spreading below ground stems is also\nfound in shrubs (e.g., creosote bush of the M ojave desert) and herbaceous (non-woody)\nplants (e.g., goldenrod, Kentucky bluegrass, a common lawn grass).\nAlthough individual aspen trees (above ground stems) are relatively short lived (typically\nless than 200 years) aspens clones represent some of the longest-lived organisms. One of\nthe best-studied clones lives in Utah and has been named \u2018Pando\u2019. It is estimated to weigh\nover six million kilograms, extend over 43 hectares, and may have an age of 80,000 years\n(see link below).\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nAs described above, aspens \u2018reproduce\u2019 asexually by spreading below ground, although\none could argue that this isn\u2019t reproduction at all, it is simply organismal growth. Aspen\nis also capable of the sexual reproduction typical of angiosperms, producing mobile male\ngametophytes (pollen) which are dispersed to the location of the female gametophytes\n(the ovules of flowers). The gametes that are subsequently produced unite to form a zygote\nthat grows and is packaged into a seed. One relatively unusual feature for Populus, com-\npared to most flowering plants, is that individual trees and (therefore) clones are unisex- POPULUS | 719\nMMaallee flfloowweerrss ooff aassppeenn..

Individual plants accumulate carbon diox-\nide from the atmosphere and use it to form carbohydrates that are both used to enlarge\nthe plant (i.e., grow) and also to be \u2018burned\u2019 in cellular respiration to provide energy for\nthe plant. Aspens are typical seed plants, requiring 17 elements: carbon, hydrogen and\noxygen (obtained as carbon dioxide and water) , plus an additional 14 \u2018minerals\u2019 that are\nobtained from the soil solution by the root system.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nBecause it is a common, wide-ranging genus there is a multitude of interactions that\naspens exhibit. Among them are the following: POPULUS | 721\nFire ecology\nIn parts of its range aspen depends upon fire to eliminate competitors. Conifers (e.g.,\nspruce and fir) do not grow as fast as aspens but can grow taller and can eventually out-\ncompete aspens by shading them out, killing trees and root sprouts. Fire can kill conifer\ncompetitors while only eliminating the above-ground part of aspens. Thus, fire allows\naspens, sprouting from underground stems, to quickly re-colonize the area. In western\nNorth America, avalanches may serve as a different form of disturbance that eliminates\naspen competitors and facilitates continued aspen presence.\nBeaver interactions\nBeaver are herbivores that feed primarily on tree bark and shoots. They are particularly\nfond of aspen and some of its relatives. As a consequence, beaver can have a very sub-\nstantial influence on forest composition, drastically decreasing the occurrence of aspen\nand increasing the frequency of species less desirable to beaver. Because beaver can signif-\nicantly affect communities by building dams and flooding areas, the preference for aspen\ncan influence what areas get flooded as a result of beaver activity.\nFurther Reading\n\u2022 \u2018Pando\u2019 and large organisms\n\u25e6 https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/unforgettable-experiences-\npando-aspen-clone\n\u25e6 https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/tree-profile-aspen-so-much-\nmore-than-a-tree\n\u25e6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)\n\u2022 Ecology of aspen\u2014Bryce Canyon National Park\n\u25e6 http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm\n\u2022 Ecology of aspen\n\u25e6 https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/beauty/aspen/ecology.shtml\n\u2022 Ecology of aspen and beaver\n\u25e6 https://western-aspen-alliance.org/files/briefs/ 722 | POPULUS\nWAA_Brief6_Beaver_final_.pdf\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Populus tremuloides leaves \u00a9 Howard F.

The potato family is interesting in that it has produced a number of impor-\ntant crops (potato, tomato, pepper, eggplant) and also important poisons and drugs (nico-\ntine, novocaine, atropine).\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nPotato (Solanum tuberosum) is a flowering plant (angiosperm) and would typically be clas-\nsified as: Plant Kingdom, flowering plant phylum (Magnoliophyta = Anthophyta), dicot\nclass (now usually considered the Eudicot class), potato order (Solanales), potato family\n(Solanaceae). Other members of this family include: tomato, pepper, tobacco, nightshade,\njimsonweed and petunia. 724 | POTATOES: SOLANUM TUBEROSUM\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nPotato is an herbaceous plant with a typi-\ncal plant structure of below-ground roots\nand above-ground shoots with leaves. Like\ntulips and a number of other plants, the\nabove-ground stem and leaves are \u2018annual\u2019,\ni.e. they die every year. The plant is peren-\nnial because a below-ground portion sur-\nvives and perpetuates the organism. The\nperennating part is a structure called a\ntuber, a branch shoot that is produced and\nremains below ground. These stems do\nnot grow upwards and do not produce\nleaves but their tips swell and produce\nNNoottee tthhaatt tthhee ppoottaattoo pprroodduuccee uunnddeerrggrroouunndd\nsstteemmss tthhaatt aarree mmuucchh eennllaarrggeedd aatt tthheeiirr ttiippss.. tubers. These results from the produc-\ntion of much more parenchyma tissue\nthan is found in a normal stem. Tubers (or functionally similar, but anatomically differ-\nent, structures called corms and rhizomes) are a common feature that allows plants to\nsurvive in areas where the above ground climate is hostile (cold or dry) for part of the\nyear. The above ground portion of the plant dies, but the below-ground part, present in\nthe more favorable (i.e. warmer/moister) environment of the soil, is able to survive and\ncan sprout new \u2018normal\u2019 (i.e. upward growing) branches when it \u2018knows\u2019 that favorable\nabove-ground conditions have returned. Parenchyma cells of the tuber possess numerous\nstarch storing plastids (amyloplasts) that provide material and energy to power growth\nwhen it resumes. The \u2018stem nature\u2019 of a potato tuber is revealed in its \u2018eyes\u2019, which are\nlateral buds, i.e. embryonic branches. They, like the leaves and branches of the above\nground stems, are distributed in a spiral fashion around the shoot. Farmers vegetatively\npropagate potatoes by cutting the tubers into sections with at least one eye and planting\nthem.

The causal organism\nfor the famine is late blight of potato (Phytophthora infestans), and the interaction between\nlate blight and potato reveals some interesting features significant to disease interactions\nspecifically and biotic interactions in general:\nThe interaction involves three \u2018players\u2019 (the disease triangle, see Chapter 30):\n\u2022 the host \u2014Phytopthora infestans infects potato (Solanum tuberosum) and also tomato\n(Solanum lycopersicon). Within both host species there are varieties that are more\nand less susceptible but as yet, no variety that is completely resistant.\n\u2022 the parasite\u2014Interestingly, it appears that Phytopthora infestans originated outside\nthe native range of either of its current-day primary hosts (potato and\ntomato), feeding on other species of Solanum . Host and parasite were brought\ntogether when potato cultivation spread from its origin in South America into\nCentral America and the parasite \u2018jumped\u2019 hosts.\n\u2022 the environment\u2014outbreaks of the disease are associated with cool and moist con-\nditions, conditions that favor the growth, reproduction and spread of the parasite.\nOther interesting interactions involving potato are:\nThe Colorado potato beetle shows some similarities to late blight of potato: it feeds on\n(i.e. \u2018has a taste for\u2019) a group of related plants: potato, tomato, pepper, indicating that\ndiet preferences are probably related to the secondary chemistry of the hosts. Like late\nblight, the beetle originated in an area where potato/tomato was not present but, given\nthe opportunity, developed a taste for these new arrivals.\nTuber formation in potato, something essential for its utility as a crop, involves a complex\ncombination of interactions with the conditions the plant encounters. Tuber formation\nis is promoted by short day photoperiods, cool night temperatures, and relatively low soil\nnitrogen levels. POTATOES: SOLANUM TUBEROSUM | 727\nThere are many, many varieties of potato\nand only a small portion of these are avail-\nable commercially in the U.S. Among\nother differences (such as color and shape)\npotatoes also vary in the type of starch\npresent and this can impact their utility in\ncooking: some potatoes (considered\n\u2018starchy\u2019) have almost all of their starch as\nunbranched polymers of glucose \u2014 this\nproduces a potato better suited for mash-\ning or baking. Other potatoes (considered \u2018waxy\u2019) have a greater portion of their starch\nexisting as branched polymers of glucose, which allows the potato to retain its shape and\nfirmness even after cooking and is better suited for use in potato salads and other situa-\ntions where it is desirable for the potato to maintain its shape (e.g. in a soup or stew).\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cDiscovery: How Colorado Potato Beetles Beat Pesticides\u201d by Joshua E.\nBrown.

The chloroplasts of other\nphotosynthetic groups of algae (e.g. diatoms, brown algae) are considered to have been\nthe result of secondary endosymbiosis, a second engulfing (phagocytosis) event where an\nalready eukaryotic cell consumed, but did not digest, another eukaryotic cell that was a\nred or green algae. These chloroplasts have four membranes, two from the chloroplast of PORPHYRA: AN EDIBLE RED ALGAE | 729\nthe red/green algae, one from the plasma membrane of the (prim i tive) red or green algae\ncell that was engulfed and a fourth membrane, again a remnant of a phagosomal mem-\nbrane, derived from the engulfing cell.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nAlthough large, often up to 20 cm in extent, Porphyra is not truly multicellular, i.e.\nparenchymatous (three-dimensional).

The wood that is produced is high in tannins and this accounts for\nboth its durability (i.e. resistance to decay) and color, features that are found in all the\nmembers of the cedar family. The cells that conduct water (trachieds) have features that\nallow them to operate at the extreme tensions that are required to pull water up to the\ntops of these tall trees. The long distance that water has to be moved, coupled with the\nfact it is moving against the force of gravity means that the tensions are extreme and the\ntracheids found in the uppermost leaves have features, including an ability to collapse,\nthat make it possible for the transport system to function. 736 | REDWOODS: THE TALLEST AND LARGEST TREES\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nThese are seed-bearing trees that produce seeds in cones, not in flowers. The seeds develop\nin mature female cones, structures where female gametophytes develop eventually pro-\nducing eggs that, when fertilized, develop into the embryos present in seeds. These trees\nalso produce male cones where male gametophytes (pollen) are produced and subse-\nquently released. The cones of Giant Sequoia are fire adapted, opening in response to\nheating created by a fire. Coast Redwood has an ability rarely found in conifers, the abil-\nity to sprout from the trunk of the tree if the top is damaged and or killed. Sprouting is\nthe result of the creation and activation of new apical meristems in response to some sig-\nnal (perhaps reduction in carbohydrate supply) that indicates that the top of the plant is\nnot functioning. As a consequence of this ability one can sometimes find straight rows of\nCoast Redwood trees reflecting their origin from the trunk of a downed stem, or a ring\nof trees that have sprouted from the base of a felled tree. Sprouting is fairly common in\nangiosperm trees but much less common in conifers.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nRedwoods are typical photosynthetic autotrophs.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nBoth species have distributions that reflect interactions with physical conditions: Coast\nRedwood requires the foggy conditions only found along the coast; Giant Sequoia is a\nclassic fire-adapted species, requiring fire both to open cones and release seeds and also to\nremove litter from the surface because successful germination requires the seeds to have\ncontact with the mineral soil.\nOnly recently have ecologists accessed the canopies of these trees and found, especially in\nthose of the Coast Redwood, remarkable communities of lichens, mosses, vascular plants,\nand associated animals. Some of the needles that are shed from the top of the trees accu-\nmulate on the intertwining branches below. Soils actually develop on these sites located\n50-100 m in the air and allow for a rich diversity of epiphytes and associated animals.\nNearly 200 \u2018species\u2019 of lichens and nearly 50 species of bryophytes and a similar number of REDWOODS: THE TALLEST AND LARGEST TREES | 737\nvascular plants have been found growing in this arboreal environment (http://www.ecol-\nogy.info/redwood.htm).\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 The Gymnosperm Database.

RHIZOBIUM: NITROGEN FIXING\nBACTERIA\nRhizobia are one of several group of bacte-\nria capable of \u2018fixing\u2019 nitrogen, i.e. con-\nverting dinitrogen gas into ammonia and\nthen into organic molecules such as amino\nacids. Because of this ability, nitrogen fix-\ning bacteria are significant conduits\nbetween an extremely large pool of nitro-\ngen in the atmosphere and living things\nwho otherwise could only obtain nitrogen\nby recycling it from existing pools of\norganic nitrogen (e.g. amino acids, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite). Unlike many nitrogen\nfixing bacteria that can fix nitrogen when \u2018free-living\u2018 (i.e. when not living inside a host\nplant) Rhizobia can only fix nitrogen when associated with a plant that provides it with\ncarbohydrates. The carbohydrates provide energy for a process that requires substantial\ninputs of energy (both ATP and the reducing power of NADH). Rhizobia only associate\nwith legumes, members of the pea family. (But not all legumes associate with Rhizobia and\nsome that have nitrogen fixing associates may have bacteria other than Rhizobia).\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nRhizobia are members of the Domain Bacteria. They are gram negative bacteria that are\nusually flagellated and motile. The ability to associate with legumes, like the ability to fix\nnitrogen, is NOT thought to be significant phylogenetically. The ability to fix nitrogen\nappears to have evolved separately several times (i.e. convergent evolution) as evidenced\nby its presence in Archaea, Cyanobacteria (see Nostoc) and several other bacterial groups\nnot phylogenetically related. Similarly, the ability to associate with legumes (which might\nbe considered a type of parasitism) is thought to have been transferred horizontally and 740 | RHIZOBIUM: NITROGEN FIXING BACTERIA\nconsequently is not a good indicator of phylogeny (which reflects vertical gene transfer).\nThe Rhizobia group is thus considered to be paraphyletic.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nRhizobia are rod shaped bacteria, 0.8 um in diameter and 2 um in length, often with fla-\ngellae. They assume a different shape when inside their host, being irregularly shaped or\noften \u2018Y\u2019 -shaped. Their presence nearby a root induces a novel structure within root hair\ncells called an infection thread. Sensing the presence of Rhizobia, root hairs curl and bac-\nteria are lodged in the crook of the curl. At this point the root cell wall is degraded and\nthe bacteria proliferate in a space outside the root hair cell membrane. A tubular \u2018infec-\ntion thread\u2019 is then produced and grows down the outside of the root hair and into the\nroot itself. The thread is bounded cell wall materials and essentially is an elongate invagi-\nnation of the cell wall, with materials contributed both by the plant and by the bacteria.\nThe infection thread eventually fuses with cell membrane at its base, adjacent to the root\ncortex. The infection thread then extends to enter (infect) cortical cells, inside of which\nthe bacteria proliferate. As the thread develops the cortical cells de-differentiated and RHIZOBIUM: NITROGEN FIXING BACTERIA | 741\nbecome meristematic, producing the tumor (nodule) that characterizes Rhizobium infec-\ntion of roots.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all bacteria, Rhizobia are not sexual but they are capable of exchanging genetic mate-\nrial by other means.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nRhizobia are heterotrophs that are capable of associating with photosynthetic plants that\nwill provide them with carbohydrates (\u2018food\u2019) as well as whatever nutrients (i.e. mineral\nelements) they need, excluding the nitrogen that they obtain from the air, where it is\nabundant. Particularly important to the nitrogen fixation process is the element molyb-\ndenum. When Rhizobia are living outside of a plant they are typical heterotrophs feed-\ning on dead organic material and use the material obtained both as \u2018building material\u2019\nfor growth and to provide substrates that are oxidized in cellular respiration to provide\nenergy.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nThe ability to associate with legumes\nrequires elaborate communication (signal-\ning) between Rhizobium and its host plant.\nFactors secreted by both the plant and the\nbacteria affect the gene expression and\nbehavior of the other.

The bac-\nteria acquire N and excrete ammonia that is incorporated by the host plant into organic\n2\nacids, forming amino acids or other nitrogen containing compounds.

The Zygomycota are in the Kingdom Fungi, a group\nunified by two structural features, a filamentous structure and the presence of cell walls\nformed of the polysaccharide chitin. Within the fungi, the bread molds are one of two\ngroups (the other are the Glomeromycota) that lack of cross-walls (i.e. the filaments are\ncoenocytic) and have a distinctive sexual cycle, see below. Molecular evidence supports\nboth the Kingdom Fungi and the Zygomycota phylum, i.e. both are thought to be a good\nphylogenetic entities. 744 | RHIZOPUS: BREAD MOLD\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nLike most fungi, Rhizopus consists of filaments (hyphae) that branch to form a feeding\nstructure, a mycelium. All the bread molds, including Rhizopus, are coenocytic, that is,\nthe filaments contain multiple (haploid) nuclei that are not partitioned into individual\ncompartments (cells). The hyphae grow from the tip, extending the filaments, and more\nnuclei are produced as they grow.\nInitially the Rhizopus mycelium \u2018mines\u2019 its\nsubstrate, acquiring food from whatever it\nis growing on. Later it produces three dis-\ntinct structures, all coenocytic: (1) verti-\ncally oriented sporangiophores that bear\nat their tip a round structure that produce\nnumerous asexual spores, (2) root-like\n\u2018rhizoids\u2019 located below the sporangio-\nphores. They are imbedded in the sub-\nstrate and allow the sporangiophores to grow upward (3) horizontally running \u2018stolons\u2019\nthat spread the fungus laterally and produce sporangiophores and rhizoids where they\nattach to the substrate. Only within the the spore producing structure are cell walls\nformed around individual nuclei, forming uninucleate cells which develop into spores and\nare dispersed.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nRhizopus reproduces asexually by producing sporangia at the end of sporangiophores. Spo-\nrangia open to release numerous spores. Occasionally hyphae of two different mating\ntypes (\u2018+\u2019 and \u2018-\u2019) encounter each other and, under appropriate conditions, will induce each\nother to grow together to effect sexual reproduction. The hyphae meet and fuse; cross\nwalls are formed on each side of the junction, creating a cell that contains haploid nuclei\nfrom each of the mating types. Pairs of nuclei, one from each mating type, are formed\nand fuse to form multiple diploid nuclei. All this occurs as the cell containing the now\ndiploid nuclei develops into a zygospore with a thick cell wall with projections extend- RHIZOPUS: BREAD MOLD | 745\ning outward. The zygospore typically becomes dormant and the hyphae connected to it\ndie. The zygospore can be dispersed by wind or water before any growth occurs. When\nit germinates a single filament emerges, forming a sporangiophore with a spore produc-\ning sporangium at its end. As this develops, the diploid nuclei undergo meiosis, creating\nhaploid nuclei, each of which develop cell walls and forming spores that are subsequently\ndispersed when the sporangium splits open at the end of its development.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nRhizopus is a heterotroph, like humans, but it digests food outside of the organism, not\ninside, as is the case for most familiar animals. Both fungi and humans secrete enzymes\nto break down food but humans secrete the enzymes inside a tube running through their\nbody, while fungi secrete enzymes into the environment that they live in. After food has\nbeen broken down it can be absorbed by the heterotroph and utilized either materially, to\nform biomolecules to increase the size of the heterotroph, or energetically, being oxidized\nin cellular respiration to provide energy sources (ATP and others). 746 | RHIZOPUS: BREAD MOLD\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nBread molds like Rhizopus are very impor-\ntant heterotrophs who collectively eat a\ngreat deal of organic material, thereby\nreleasing nutrients that autotrophs can\nuse. But they also destroy substantial\nquantities of stored food. Occasionally\nbread molds, including some forms of Rhi-\nzopus, can cause diseases of both plants\nand animals. Because Rhizopus is relatively\neasy to culture, it is used industrially to carry out some important chemical conversions,\ne.g. the conversion of plant steroids into specific chemicals like cortisone and the produc-\ntion of fumaric acid from sugar. Rhizopus is also used to produce tempeh, a soybean \u2018curd\u2019\nfood consisting of crushed soybeans partially decomposed by Rhizopus and held together\nby fungal hyphae.\nFurther Reading\n\u2022 \u201cHow to Make Tempeh\u201d by Emily Han\n\u25e6 https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-tempeh-cooking-lessons-\nfrom-the-kitchn-202369\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Rhizopus zygospores \u00a9 Curtis Clark adapted by George Briggs is licensed under a CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution\nNonCommercial ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Sliced Tempeh \u00a9 FotoosVanRobin is licensed under a CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike)\nlicense RICE\nRice is our most important cultivated\nplant, feeding more people than any other\ncrop. It is a n annual or short-lived peren-\nnial grass species native to Asia. Its\ndomestication (i.e. cultivation and modi-\nfication by humans) started 8 to 13 thou-\nsand years ago. Much of the world,\nespecially Asia, has rice as its primary\nfood source and rice production is critical\nfor feeding the world. Rice requires warm,\nmoist conditions for growth and is grown world-wide in tropical and warm temperate\nhabitats. As is the case in all \u2018cereal grains\u2019 the \u2018cereal\u2019\u2014 the portion eaten \u2014 is a one-\nseeded fruit with the cells of a very thin fruit fused to those of the seed coat.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nOryza sativa is by far to most utilized rice species, although a second species (Oryza glaber-\nrima) is grown in western Africa. \u2018Wild rice\u2019 (Zizania aquatica and Z. palustris) are in the\nsame tribe (a level of classification between genus and family) but are not generally con-\nsidered a type of rice. Wild rice was and is harvested by Native Americans and has a very\nlimited amount of production, being used primarily for the gourmet food industry. Virtu-\nally all of the world\u2019s production of rice is Oryza sativa, and there are numerous varieties.\n(The Rice Association states that there are over 40,000 varieties and if you visit a grocery\nstore you might see a dozen or so different types.) Oryza is in the monocot group and is in\nthe grass family (Poaceae). 748 | RICE\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nRice has a typical grass structure with a series of leaves that form a false stem through\nwhich emerges the main stem when the plant flowers and fruits. Although there are some\nperennial varieties, most rice varieties are annuals with the plant senescing as it develops\nfruit. The few perennial varieties have annual shoots but are able to sprout new stems\nfrom a below-ground shoot system. Particularly significant to its growth in flooded condi-\ntions is the fact that the leaves have a thick cuticle and a vertically corrugated surface that\nallows the grooves to form air-filled capillaries. These allow for the movement of both\noxygen and carbon dioxide.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nRice reproduces sexually, producing bisexual flowers that develop into fruits (cereal\ngrains) after pollination and fertilization. As is the case for most grasses, pollination is\nby the wind and the flower has features to promote pollination: long stamens that are\nexerted (extended out of) the flower and elongated stigmas that also extend out of the\nflower. Most rice varieties are annual and show little vegetative spread. But perennial rice\nvarieties do spread laterally below ground and can produce of new erect branches after\nthe first is harvested. In this manner the plant may yield crops for up to 30 years. Rice\nis difficult to propagate vegetatively and most rice that is planted is first sprouted from\nseeds and then transplanted as seedlings.\nFFlloowweerriinngg rriiccee wwiitthh ssttaammeennss eexxeerrtteedd mmaakkiinngg\nwwiinndd ppoolllliinnaattiioonn mmuucchh mmoorree ppoossssiibbllee..

RICE | 749\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nRice is a photosynthetic autotroph that\nuses the C 3 photosynthetic pathway. Like\nall plants, rice requires 14 mineral ele-\nments in order to grow, with nitrogen\noften being the limiting factor for growth\nand crop yield. In common with most\nplants, rice can acquire minerals that are\nnot essential, including minerals that are\ntoxic to the plant and/or toxic to organ-\nisms that eat the plant. An example is\narsenic. Arsenic is not required by rice or\nby any plant, but is required in trace\namounts by at least a few animals. Arsenic\nis sometimes accumulated by plants, occa-\nsionally to levels that some consider unsafe. Rice is a crop that is much more likely to\naccumulate arsenic than other crop species, primarily due to the fact that it is usually cul-\ntivated in aquatic situations that can promote arsenic availability. While no one is stating\nthat all rice should be avoided, there are some concerns being raised and the arsenic con-\ntent of rice is being monitored.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nLike wheat and corn, the most significant of rice\u2019s interaction is with humans: their efforts\nto cultivate rice are of overwhelming significance to the plant. Three other interactions\nrelated to its cultivation are worth noting:\n\u2022 flooding is not required by rice but it is an effective weed prevention technique.\nMost weeds (and plants in general) do not thrive under flooded conditions, hence\nthe practice of flooding rice paddies cuts down on the number of competitors that\nrice must face.\n\u2022 Rice is affected by many pests/diseases including fungi, bacteria and viruses.\n\u2022 one plant that does thrive in flooded conditions and that is often present in rice 750 | RICE\npaddies is Azolla, a small, floating aquatic fern.

It is through this haustorium that nutrients pass from the plant to the\nfungus, allowing it to grow and reproduce.\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nRust fungi life cycles are complex.

Many members of the genus are herbaceous, including several\ncultivated species: A. drucunculus is the source of the spice tarragon; A. absinthium (aka SAGEBRUSH | 757\nwormwood) is used to flavor some wines and to produce the liquor absinthe; A. stelleriana\n(\u2018dusty miller\u2019) is a common ornamental plant; A. vulgare (mugwort), is a common weed.\nAll members of the genus produce chemicals that are aromatic (in an olfactory sense),\nhence their use as flavorings. Some of the chemicals produced by Artemisia have been\nused medicinally (either directly or after some chemical modification) to treat malaria,\ninternal parasites and morphine addiction. The common name sagebrush comes from the\nsuperficial similarity in scent with the herb sage, an unrelated species. The common name\nsagebrush is applied to a group of roughly twenty species of shrubs found in the western\nU.S.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nShrubs are woody plants that have exten-\nsive branching and do not grow particu-\nlarly tall. Sagebrush is rarely over two m\ntall and, although it often has a main\nstem, it branches extensively and may\nsend up multiple stems from its base.\nBecause they rarely have taller plants\naround them, shading is not a problem and their spreading habit allows them to intercept\nmore sunlight. Although woody, they have an unusual pattern of secondary growth where\nthe vascular cambium often does not form a complete ring around the stem/branch, pro-\nducing branches that are not round in cross section. Sagebrush leaves are evergreen,\nroughly five cm in length, have three \u2018teeth\u2019 at the end and have a whitish \u2018bloom\u2019, the\nresult of many small hairs. The physical structure of sagebrush is important to a wide\nvariety of other species in providing an improved thermal environment both in the sum-\nmer through shading, and in the winter by reducing wind speed and convective heat cool-\ning. Sagebrush roots often penetrate several meters into the soil to obtain water. They also\nproduce a root system closer to the soil surface (less than a meter) and studies have shown\nthat at night sagebrush carries out \u2018hydraulic lift\u2019, moving water that actually ends up\nmoistening surface layers of the soil and providing water to both sagebrush and poten-\ntially to other plants. 758 | SAGEBRUSH\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nSagebrush is a typical angiosperm, producing spores in flowers that develop male game-\ntophytes (pollen) that are generally dispersed to other flowers where they complete their\ndevelopment by growing to the location (an ovule) of the female gametophyte (embryo\nsac) that has developed from a haploid spore. Members of the Asteraceae have \u2018flowers\u2019\nthat are actually inflorescences. Many familiar members of the Asteraceae (asters, sun-\nflowers) have two types of flowers in the inflorescence: ray flowers (\u2018petals\u2019) and disk\nflowers. Other members of the family (e.g. dandelion) have only ray flowers. Sagebrush\nrepresents a third type of Asteraceae inflorescence, one that has only disc flowers.

Carnivorous plants of various types have evolved independently at least seven\ntimes. One category of carnivorous plants are those that produce pitchers, a structure that\ncollects water and has other features that enhance the likelihood of trapping insects in\nthat water. Carnivorous plants utilizing pitchers evolved independently in several differ-\nent plant families. Although insects are the primary \u2018prey\u2019, occasionally frogs and even\nmice are captured. Death is not directly caused by actions of the plant but is the result\nof \u2018drowning\u2019 or an inability to escape to feed themselves. Decomposition of the prey\nis accomplished primarily by microorganisms living in the pitcher but may be aided by\nenzymes secreted by the plant. In addition to pitchers, carnivorous plants may capture\nprey by glue mechanisms (e.g. sundews, bladderworts) or mechanical traps (Venus flytrap,\nbladderworts). Carnivory is associated with habitats that are nutrient poor, generally\nbecause the soils are acidic and oxygen-poor (e.g. bogs), conditions where decomposition 762 | SARRACENIA, A CARNIVOROUS PLANT\nand the consequent release of nutrients, is limited. The pitchers are habitats on the plant\nwhere conditions for decomposition are more favorable and released nutrients are directly\nabsorbed by the plant through the leaves or leaf parts that form the pitcher.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nCarnivorory is found in over 500 plant species, in\nover 10 genera and over 10 families in both the\nmonocot and eudicot groups. There is one species of\nmonocots that produces pitchers but most are\nedicts, found primarily in two unrelated families,\nthe Nepenthaceae, found in Africa, and the Sarrace-\nniaceae, found in both North and South America.\nThe plants described here are in the genus Sarrace-\nnia, which has about ten species, all in North Amer-\nica.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nThe pitchers are highly modified leaves whose margins are sealed for most of its length,\ncreating a water retaining pitcher with a short unsealed terminal portion forming a flange\nat the top. Leaves occur in clusters on a short vertical stem rising from a rhizome. Flowers\nare very large and observers often don\u2019t recognize that they are part of the same plant that\nis producing the pitchers. SARRACENIA, A CARNIVOROUS PLANT | 763\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nSarracenia is a typical flowering plant,\nproducing seeds, composite structures\nwith an embryo, stored food and a protec-\ntive seed coat. The seeds of Sarrace-\nnia have a rather limited dispersal ability.\nIt can also spread vegetatively by means of\nits rhizomes.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nCarnivorous plants nicely reflect the contrast between heterotroph and autotroph nutri-\ntion. When heterotrophs \u2018eat\u2019 something, they acquire both food (i.e. carbohydrates and\nother materials to burn in cellular respiration) and also nutrients (i.e. 14 minerals) that\nall life requires. In contrast, autotrophs make their own \u2018food\u2019 (carbohydrates), gener-\nally in photosynthesis, and need to acquire minerals in a completely distinct process that\nrequires specialized structures, roots. Carnivorous plants don\u2019t \u2018eat\u2019 in the same sense as\nheterotrophs; they derive no carbohydrates from the process. They \u2018eat\u2019 solely to acquire\nmineral elements because they live in situations where the standard structure of nutrient\nacquisition (roots) is of limited effectiveness. Pitcher plants have reduced levels of pho-\ntosynthesis because, although green, leaves are not displayed in a way to maximize light\nacquisition. If pitcher plants are grown in environments with higher levels of nutrients\n(available from the roots) they reduce the size and number of pitchers, allowing them to\nincrease photosynthesis.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nThe pitcher provides a habitat for a variety of decomposer organisms: bacteria, proto-\nzoans, water molds and others. In fact the pitchers have their own food webs with not\nonly decomposers but also organisms that feed higher up on the food chain: rotifers,\nmidge larvae and others. Several mosquito species specialize in laying their eggs in pitcher 764 | SARRACENIA, A CARNIVOROUS PLANT\nplants and their larvae are often the \u2018top carnivore\u2019 in the ecosystem.

Most modern treatments do not elevate this group to the phylum level\nbut combine it with other \u2018heterokonts\u2019, a group defined by having two characteristic fla-\ngella, one longer than the other. The heterokonts (sometimes called the Stramenopiles)\nalso includes diatoms and the heterotrophic water molds (Oomycota). The pigmentation\nof photosynthetic stramenopiles is similar to that of the coccolithophores (haptophytes)\nand the cryptophytes. This may not represent a common phylogeny but instead that\nall three groups separately became photosynthetic by acquiring the same photosynthetic\nendosymbiont.

Brown algae\nhave transport systems that allow photosynthate from the blade to be distributed\nthroughout the plant.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nMost brown algae are sexual and exhibit alternation of generations. The \u2018dominant\u2019 (i.e.\nlarger and more visible) stage is usually the sporophyte (diploid) stage but there are some\nbrown algae that show isomorphic alternation of generations (the sporophyte and game-\ntophyte look identical) and a few where the gametophyte stage is dominant. Rockweed\n(Fucus), shows yet another life cycle, one like humans, with no alternation of genera-\ntions and where the only haploid cells are gametes. In Fucus the gametes are distinct from\none another (egg, sperm) and in some brown algae they all look the same (isogametes).\nWithin the brown algae flagellated cells are common and include sperm, isogametes and\nzoospores, which are mobile cells that can attach to a substrate and grow into a new\norganism.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nFucus is a typical photoautotroph, using the energy of sunlight to synthesize carbohy-\ndrates from carbon dioxide and then using the carbohydrates as an energy source in cel- 768 | SEAWEED, FUCUS: A BROWN ALGAE\nlular respiration and as building materials to synthesize a variety of biomolecules.

It is an easily recog-\nnized fern, with a large leaf that shows the\nclassic \u2018dissected\u2019 leaf pattern. In compari-\nson with other ferns, note that the leaf on the right is dissected once into roughly 17\n\u2018leaflets\u2019 and that each leaflet is serrated with large rounded teeth. In other ferns the \u2018teeth\u2019\nare more distinct, creating a leaf that may be \u2018dissected\u2019 or \u2018cut\u2019 multiple times, i.e. the\nleaflets have leaflets. Sometimes a fern leaf may be cut as many as four times (the leaf has\nleaflets, which have leaflets, which have leaflets, which have leaflets). (see wood fern).\nSensitive fern is a perennial plant with a below ground stem that lives for many years,\nsending up leaves each spring that senesce and wither in the fall.\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nSensitive ferns clearly belong in the fern group, which most workers consider to be a\nphylum, the Pterophyta. Among other things the group is united in having vascular tis-\nsue but not producing seeds. Recently, many workers have lumped horsetails and \u2018wisk\nferns\u2019 together with the ferns. While horsetails (one genus) and wisk ferns (two genera)\nare very small groups, the fern group is large (over 12,000 species) and possesses consid-\nerable diversity in form. Although most of the members of this group look \u2018fern-like\u2019, i.e.\nthey are herbaceous with relatively large leaves that are dissected into leaflets, some ferns\nlook very \u2018un-fern-like\u2019, including some that look a bit like clover (Marsilea), some that are\ntiny/small floating aquatic plants (Azolla and Salvinea) and some \u2018tree ferns\u2019 that are over 770 | SENSITIVE FERN\n3 m tall and resemble palms because of their dissected leaves. Fern ancestry goes back to\nthe Paleozoic, 350 million years ago.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nSensitive fern has an underground stem\n(rhizome) from which emerge the leaves,\nwhich, unlike some ferns, are not dis-\ntinctly clustered together. While m ost\nferns just produce one type of leaf that\nboth photosynthesizes and also can pro-\nduce spores, sensitive fern is dimorphic,\nmeaning it produces two types of leaves\nthat are specialized in their functioning:\ngreen leaves (on the left in the accompa-\nnying figure) that photosynthesize but\nproduce no spores and separate spore-pro-\nducing leaves that do not look much at all\nlike leaves (on the right of the accompany-\ning figure). The below ground stem (rhi-\nzome) lives for many years, sending up\nleaves each spring that senesce and wither\nin the fall. Other common dimorphic\nspecies are Ostrich fern, Cinnamon fern\nand Marsilea (water clover), while a number of other ferns (Christmas fern, Interrupted\nfern) have dimorphic leaflets, i.e. the leaflets of some of the leaves are specialized for spore\nproduction.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all plants, sensitive fern exhibits alternation of generations with a visible sporophyte\nand hard-to-find bisexual gametophyte that is small, uncommonly seen, and quickly over\ngrown by the sporophyte that grows out from the archegonium.

Much of the U.S. production is exported.\nSoybean is particular notable because of the many ways it is used. It is eaten fresh and dry.\nThe seeds can be processed to yield soy oil or to make soy milk (produced by grinding soy\nseeds in water, producing an emulsion of protein and oil). Soy milk is used to make tofu.\nThe insoluble remnants of these extractions are used in animal feed.\nSoybean shares a name (the genus name, Glycine) with one of\nthe twenty amino acids, not because soybean is protein rich,\nalthough it is, but because of a connection to sweetness. In\nthe 1700\u2019s Linnaeus gave a genus of plants the name \u2018Glycine\u2019\nbecause of the sweetness in the root of one of its species (not\nThhee aammiinnoo aacciidd ggllyycciinnee\nG. max).

The sweetness found in plants of the genus Glycine is not due to the amino acid,\nit comes from sugars present in the roots.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nSoybean is a flowering plant (angiosperm)\nand is a dicot (eudicot) , in the Fabaceae, the\npea family, a large and economically impor-\ntant family containing species that are used\nfor food, medicine and lumber plus many\nspecies that are important ecologically. The\ncultivated species is derived from a wild\nancestor, Glycine soja, which grows wild in\nJapan, Korea, China and Russia.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nSoybean is an annual herbaceous species that typically grows to roughly one meter in\nheight and may be branched or not depending on the cultivar and planting density. Leaves\nare compound and generally trifoliate. Small flowers are produced on short branch shoots\ngrowing from the axial buds at the base of leaves. Flowers are self fertile and develop into 774 | SOYBEANS (AND OTHER BEANS)\npods (the official fruit name is legume) that are typically less than 10 cm long and contain\n2-3 seeds.\nSSeellff ffeerrttiillee flfloowweerrss ooff tthhee ssooyybbeeaann ppllaanntt\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nIt is a typical flowering plant with bisexual flowers that produce male gametophytes\n(pollen) and female gametophytes located in ovules present at the base of the flower, the\novary. The flowers are self fertile; pollen from a flower can be transferred to the stigma of\nthe same flower and it will germinate, grow to the ovule, and fertilize the egg produced\nby the female gametophyte. Since meiosis does occur in the production of both gameto-\nphytes some variability results from the sexual process but much less than would occur if\nflowers were fertilized by pollen from different plants.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nSoybean is a photosynthetic autotroph which uses the C 3 photosynthetic pathway, pro-\nducing sucrose that can be used as an energy source in cellular respiration or as a mater-\nial source, providing carbohydrates. Like many members of the pea family, soybean often\nhouses Rhizobium bacteria in nodules (galls) on its roots. The Rhizobium bacteria provide SOYBEANS (AND OTHER BEANS) | 775\nNNiittrrooggeenn fifixxiinngg nnoodduulleess oonn ssooyybbeeaann rroooottss\na source of nitrogen to the plant, but they also represent a sizable drain on photosynthate\nbecause substantial amounts are ne eded to \u2018feed\u2019 the bacteria, mostly to provide energy\nfor the nitrogen fixation process. Whether or not the soybean benefits (grows more) from\nits interaction with Rhizobium depends on the amount of available nitrogen in the soil. But\nsymbiotic nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium lessens the nitrogen fertilizer needs for growing\nsoybeans and also enriches the soil with nitrogen for subsequent crops.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nSoybean is a short-day plant, although the specific requirements vary with cultivar. One\nof the reasons soybean is not grown near the equator is because the daylength is never suf-\nficiently short to trigger flowering. In addition to the interaction with Rhizobium, soybean\nhas significant interactions with a large group of pathogens and herbivores: nematodes,\nwater molds (Phytophthora), rust diseases, a variety of bacterial diseases, and a large num-\nber of insect herbivores, most of which attack other crops as well. 776 | SOYBEANS (AND OTHER BEANS)\nSSooyybbeeaann lleeaavveess wwiitthh rruusstt ddiisseeaassee\nOOtthheerr eeddiibbllee mmeemmbbeerrss ooff tthhee ppeeaa ffaammiillyy:: bbeeaannss aanndd\nootthheerrss\nLike the grass family, the pea family (Fabaceae) is the source of a variety of edible crops.\nThese are generally divided into \u2018pulse\u2019 crops where the seeds (often called beans) are har-\nvested dry, and green vegetable crops that are harvested and eaten before drying.

In most mosses (e.g. Polytrichium) the sporophytes (the\ndiploid part) have two components: a stalk and a capsule situated at the top of the stalk.\nHowever, in Sphagnum the sporophyte is solely the capsule and the stalk that it sits on is\nhaploid and part of the gametophyte. SPHAGNUM-PEAT MOSS | 781\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nSphagnum exhibits the typical alternation of\ngenerations found in mosses, with a haploid\ngamete producing plant (gametophyte) that is\nrelatively large, long-lived and noticeable, and a\nmuch smaller, shorter-lived diploid sporophyte\nthat is produced on the gametophyte, produces\nspores, and then is shed.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd EEnneerrggyy\nSphagnum is a photosynthetic autotroph, it\nmakes food (carbohydrate) through the process\nof photosynthesis and then uses this carbohy-\ndrate both as a material to make biomoleules\nAA SSpphhaaggnnuumm ggaammeettoopphhyyttee\nand also to provide energy for metabolic activi-\nties. For the gametophyte this is true throughout its existence. Although the sporophyte\nof many mosses is green and photosynthetic early in its development, most of the photo-\nsynthetic surface is in the stalk. For Sphagnum sporophytes with no stalk, the sporophyte\ncontributes little or no carbohydrates to its livelihood and is totally dependent upon the\ngametophyte throughout its existence.\nMineral nutrition of mosses is different from that of vascular plants, whose roots obtain\nobtain nutrients from the soil solution. The source of mineral nutrition for most mosses\nis not the soil, it is precipitation (sometimes altered in chemistry as it flows down tree\ntrunks) and dust. This is especially true for sphagnum moss because it generally occurs as\na carpet sitting on top of a large mat of poorly decomposed material (usually sphagnum\nplants themselves). At least some species of sphagnum are unusual in their ability to use\namino acids as a source of nitrogen in addition to nitrate and ammonia. 782 | SPHAGNUM-PEAT MOSS\nSSpphhaaggnnuumm ssppoorroopphhyyttee ddeevveellooppmmeenntt\u2014\u2014AA:: tthhrreeee aarrcchhggoonniiaa aatt\ntthhee ttiipp ooff aa ggaammeettoopphhyyttee sstteemm,, BB:: ssppoorroopphhyyttee ssttrruuccttuurree,, CC::\nssppoorroopphhyyttee llooccaatteedd aatt tthhee ttiipp ooff aa ggaammeettoopphhyyttee ssttaallkk,, llaabbeelllleedd\n((qqss))..

Most significant is its ability\nto alter water and nutrient conditions on a site. Specifically, sphagnum can make areas of\nland waterlogged, acidic and nutrient poor. This is advantageous for sphagnum because it\neliminates competitors that might shade out the sphagnum. It is also significant for other SPHAGNUM-PEAT MOSS | 783\nspecies (e.g. pitcher plants and sundews) that thrive in open, waterlogged habitats, again\nbecause potential competitors are kept at bay. Interestingly, not only can sphagnum make\nterrestrial habitats waterlogged it can also make aquatic habitats (e.g. ponds) somewhat\nterrestrial, by growing across the surface and producing a mat capable of supporting ter-\nrestrial plants, although the habitat is waterlogged and not truly terrestrial.\nThe remnants of bogs are often \u2018mined\u2019 for the un-decomposed material, called peat, that\ncan be used as a fuel source. Like coal and oil, the energy captured in photosynthesis is\nstill available in the peat because the plant material has not been oxidized in cellular res-\npiration of decomposer organisms. Dried peat is also a common soil additive in garden-\ning.\nFurther Reading\n\u2022 \u201cSphagnum\u201d by the Australian National Herbrarium, from their Australian\nBryophytes pages:\n\u25e6 http://www.cpbr.gov.au/bryophyte/ecology-sphagnum.html\n\u2022 Bryophyte Ecology by Janice M.

Although Native Americans\ndomesticated the plant and selected for\nplants with single heads and larger seeds,\nits initial use after being introduced into\nEurope was primarily as an ornamental\nplant in gardens. It became popular as a\ncrop plant first in Russia, largely as a con-\nsequence of edicts from the Eastern Orthodox Church concerning diet restrictions during\nLent. During Lent, consumption of oils from a variety of plants (e.g. olive, palm, sesame)\nwas forbidden, but sunflower, a recent arrival, was not banned and sunflower became an\nimportant crop in Russia by being a source of oil during Lent. It is now the national\nflower of both Russia and the Ukraine. Early in the 20th century sunflower came back to\nNorth America as a crop grown primarily for its oil in both the northern U.S. and in\nCanada. In the southern hemisphere, Argentina is a major producer of sunflower. The oil\nfrom sunflower is used both in cooking and also industrially (e.g. as a base for paints). It\ncan be used as a substitute for diesel oil directly or after first being converted to biodiesel.\nAfter oil has been extracted the remaining seed can be used for animal feed. To a limited\nextent sunflower seeds are eaten directly, especially by baseball players!\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy\nHelianthus is a genus in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), one of the largest families\nangiosperms. There are roughly 70 species, both annual and perennial, with H. annuus (an SUNFLOWER: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS | 785\nannual) being the most important crop species. A perennial species (H. tuberosus), called\nJerusalem artichoke, is occasionally grown for its edible tubers.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nSunflower is an herbaceous annual.\nAlthough wild representatives are usually\nbranched, the cultivated form typically\ndoes not branch and consists of a single\nstem that may be well over two meters in\nheight with the single large head whose\nactions inhibit the production of branches\nbelow.. The stem produces a vascular cam-\nbium but does not form wood (a continu-\nous cylinder of secondary xylem) instead\nit adds to the existing vascular bundles.\nAlthough it does not produce wood, the\nstem is remarkably \u2018woody\u2019, meaning\ntough, durable and resistant to deforma-\nCCrroossss sseeccttiioonn ooff ssuunnflfloowweerr sstteemm sshhoowwiinngg tion.

The stem is often more than 5 cm in diameter, with most of the\nwidth from primary growth. The bulk of the stem is pith and the strength comes from a\nring of vascular bundles near the margin of the stem. 786 | SUNFLOWER: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS\nFields of mature sunflowers are striking\nbecause all the heads, regardless of the\ntime of day, are facing the same direction,\neast. In contrast, younger flower heads,\nbefore they start to flower, show a daily\nmovement, tracking the sun from east to\nwest during the day and then returning to\nthe east overnight. The control of the\nmovement probably involves both an\nendog enous biological clock and a\nresponsiveness to incident light.\nThe heads of sunflowers are a good place\nto observe the spirals associated with\nplant architecture. Spirals rotating in\nboth clockwise and counter-clockwise\ndirections are evident. The number of spi-\nrals usually relates to two numbers in the\nFibonacci sequence (momath.org/home/\nfibonacci-numbers-of-sunflower-seed-\nspirals/).

The \u2018flower\u2019 is actually an inflores-\ncence, a structure of several hundred flowers of two types: the \u2018petals\u2019 of a sunflower are\nray flowers, with a large petal that is actually composed of five fused parts and is is asym-\nmetrically oriented, extending out to one side of the flower. Ray flowers are often sterile,\nlacking both male and female parts. The central disk flowers that make up the bulk of SUNFLOWER: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS | 787\nthe inflorescence have much smaller petals that are arranged in a ring. They are bisexual\nand have a distinct phenology (timing). For the head as a whole the central \u2018disk\u2019 flowers\nmature from the outside inward, i.e. the first flowers to open are on the outside. Each indi-\nvidual flower also has a pattern of development. The anthers mature first, making pollen\navailable to pollinators, primarily bees. After the pollen has been available for several days\na stigma pushes up through the ring of anthers. Self-pollination of a particular flower by\nitself is unlikely unless the flower has not been visited by pollinators, in which case there\nmay still remain pollen that contacts the stigma as it moves upward. While the annual H.\nannuus must set seed to reproduce, the perennial H. tuberosa can reproduce via its tubers,\nwhich, like potatoes, are produced on underground stems (rhizomes) that allow the plant\nto spread laterally. This is part of the reason that H. tuberosa can be a problem weed.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nSunflower is a photosynthetic autotroph which uses the C 3 photosynthetic pathway.\nAmong other pathways, the sugars produced in photosynthesis are transported as sucrose\nfrom the leaves to developing seeds and then used to construct the oils present in the sun-\nflower seeds. The conversion of sugars to fats requires energy (reducing power and ATP)\nand this is supplied by the oxidation of sugars.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nSunflower probably represents a classic case in the evolution of crops. It is a \u2018weedy\u2019\nspecies in an ecological sense, one that thrives in disturbed habitats. Because of this, it\nprobably frequented the areas close to primitive human habitation. Subsequently humans\nrecognized its utility and started actively cultivating it and thereby developing it as a\ncrop. A similar scenario may also apply to wheat and other crop species. 788 | SUNFLOWER: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS\nHelianths tuberosus tubers (rhizomes)\nHelianthus tuberosus flowers\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\u2022 \u201cTypes of Sunflowers\u201d by Prairie California.

The most common\nspecies in the northeastern U.S. occur on\nmaples but there are other species that\noccur on other tree species. The black\nspots form when the fungus produces\nlarge black masses of hyphae (\u2018stroma\u2019)\nthat break through the epidermis of the\nleaf. In the spring of the year, spores pro-\nduced in these black spots are released and\ncan be dispersed by the wind. Some fortu-\nnate spores end up on newly produced\nleaves where they can germinate and pen-\netrate through the epidermis to get inside\nthe leaf. The tar spot fungus is an example of an endophyte, an organism (usually a fun-\ngus) that lives inside of plants. Generally endophytes are not very apparent and they are\nnot generally thought of as causing disease. Some endophytes are even thought to be a\npositive presence, providing benefits such as disease and stress resistance while at the\nsame time benefiting from being fed and protected by the plant\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy aanndd ttaaxxoonnoommyy\nRhytisma is an ascomycete fungus. As is common for a number of fungi, Rhytisma was\ndescribed with both a sexual form (placed in the Ascomycota) and an asexual form (placed\nin the Fungi Imperfecti) but it is now recognized that there is one entity that sometimes\nreproduces sexually and sometimes does not. (Placing fungi into phyla used to require the TAR SPOT FUNGUS | 791\nobservation of sexual stages; and fungi lacking sexual stages were placed in the \u2018Fungi\nImperfecti\u2019). With modern molecular techniques fungi can be placed into groups without\nobservation of the sexual stages.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nTar spot fungus consist of septate hyphae (i.e. filaments with cross walls) that spread\nthrough part but not all of the leaf that they have penetrated, typically spreading 1-3 cm.\nIf sexual reproduction is to occur hyphae from two different mating strains need to find\neach other (i.e. both are present in the same leaf) and some of their hyphae fuse (plas-\nmogamy) to form a dikaryon cell that grows to produce dikaryon hyphae where each cell\nhas two haploid nuclei. In late summer both the haploid hyphae (i.e. those of each mat-\ning type) and the dikaryon hyphae intertwine to form a stroma, a thick mass of hyphae.\nWithin the stroma are produced small, cup shaped \u2018apothecia\u2019. Within these structures the\ntips of some of the dikaryon cells produce the the characteristic asci\u2013elongate cells where\nkaryogamy occurs to make the cell temporarily diploid. This is the only diploid cell pro-\nduced by tar spot fungus or any ascomycete. The diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis fol-\nlowed by mitosis to produce a cell with eight haploid nuclei, each of which develops a cell\nwall to form ascospores. The ascospores of tar spot fungus are quite narrow and pointy.\nAA ggeenneerraalliizzeedd aappootthheecciiuumm,, aa ccuupp sshhaappeedd ssttrruuccttuurree iinn wwhhiicchh aarree bboorrnn aassccii.. 792 | TAR SPOT FUNGUS\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nTar spot fungus can reproduce both sexually and asexually.

Hyphae appar-\nently can acquire nutrients from host cells without the presence of haustoria, evidently\nobtaining materials that \u2018leak\u2019 from cells. Because of the fungus\u2019s modest growth habits (it\ndoesn\u2019t grow particular fast and does not grow extensively, i.e. it does not go through the\nentire leaf) there is minimal damage to its host.\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nRecently some endophytes, like tar-spot fungus, have been recognized to benefit their\nhost in a variety of ways: by producing toxins that deter other herbivores, by somehow\nmaking their host more able to fight off other diseases, by making their host better able\nto withstand harsh environmental conditions (e.g. drought).\nAnother endophytic interaction that you may have heard of is \u2018St. Anthony\u2019s fire\u2019, a\nhuman disease caused by the consumption of grain (e.g. wheat, rye) infected with another\nendophytic fungus.

In the normal process carried out by all cells, two enzymes (topoisomerase, heli-\ncase) separate a portion of double strand DNA into two single-strands and DNA poly-\nmerase is then able to extend DNA strands complementary to each of the single strands\nthat have been revealed. In PCR, heat is used to separate (\u2018melt\u2019) the double stranded\nDNA into single strands. Then the mixture is cooled slightly to allow the two \u2018primers\u2019 to\nbind (anneal) to the single strands. The primers are two short sequences of single stranded\nDNA (one for each strand) complementary to each end of the gene that is to be copied.\nThe annealing of the primers produces a two stranded \u2018starting point\u2019 from which DNA\npolymerase can add nucleotides, thereby extending a DNA molecule complementary to\nthe existing single strand. The DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus (called \u2018Taq poly-\nmerase\u2019) is useful in this process because it can be heated to a temperature high enough\nto melt DNA yet is still able to function. The PCR machine (called a \u2018thermocycler\u2019) per- THERMUS AQUATICUS | 797\nforms repeated cycles of high temperature, melting the double stranded DNA, then cool-\ning slightly to allow primer sequences to bind \u2018anneal\u2019 to the single strand, and thereby\nallowing Taq polymerase to work to extend the primer strand in a manner complemen-\ntary to the single strand. This process (a thermal cycle) is repeated multiple times to get\nmultiple copies of the DNA under study. Although the technique is feasible using poly-\nmerases not from thermophilic bacteria, one would have to add additional enzyme after\neach heating because most enzymes are destroyed by the temperatures required to melt\ndouble stranded DNA. Taq polymerase can be added at the beginning and it remains sta-\nble through the multiple cycles (usually about 30) needed to produce enough (usually mil-\nlions!) copies of the gene.\nFurther Reading\n\u2022 \u201cLife in Extreme Heat\u201d by Yellowstone National Park Service\n\u25e6 https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/life-in-extreme-heat.htm\n\u2022 \u201cYellowstone Hot Springs\u201d by Microbe Wiki\n\u25e6 https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Yellow-\nstone_Hot_Springs\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Steam from a Hot spring in Yellowstone National Park \u00a9 Brocken Inaglory is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attri-\nbution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 PCR Basic Principle \u00a9 Ygonaar is licensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license WHEAT\nWheat should be familiar to everyone although perhaps only as a food and not very much\nas an organism. Wheat is one of the oldest crop species, originating in Turkey probably\nclose to 10,000 years ago, although some researchers place its origin older. As described\nbelow what we call \u2018wheat\u2019 is at least three different entities, differing in chromosome\nnumber, evolutionary history and also features related to harvesting and baking.\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy aanndd ttaaxxoonnoommyy\nWheat is a flowering plant. Multicellular, terrestrial, photosynthetic organisms (\u201c land\nplants\u201d) are generally put in the Plant Kingdom. The most important group within\nthis kingdom, based on a number of different measures (number of species, economic\nimportance, ecological importance) is a group that produces flowers, (flowering plants =\nangiosperms = the phylum Magnoliophyta). Within the angiosperms there are two main\ngroups, monocots and dicots (now called eudicots). Wheat is in the monocot grouping, WHEAT | 799\ngenerally considered at the class level (Liliopsida), although modern treatments recognize\nthe group but may not assign it a particular rank. In contrast to the dicots, monocots are\nconsidered monophyletic (originating from a single ancestor) and therefore a sound tax-\nonomic entity. In contrast, the old dicot group is not considered monophyletic. This is\nwhy the grouping \u2018eudicot\u2019 came into being, it contains just those dicots (almost all of\nthem) that are united by being monophyletic. Wheat is in the Poaceae, the grass family,\none of the four most important families of flowering plants and the family that includes\nall our important \u2018cereal grains\u2019 (wheat, rice, corn, barley, oats). There are several different\nspecies called \u2018wheat\u2019 and these are related by polyploidy: one is diploid (eikorn wheat),\ntwo are tetraploid (emmer and durum wheat) and one is hexaploid (bread wheat).\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nWheat is a fairly typical \u2018herbaceous\u2019 (i.e.\nnon-woody) plant. Like almost all organ-\nisms that are considered plants, wheat\nconsists of cylindrical structures, shoots\nand roots. Both these structures have an\nembryonic region (apical meristem) at\ntheir tip that produces cells whose expan-\nsion elongates the cylinder. The shoot api-\ncal meristem also produces organs (leaves)\nthat are typically broad and thin. The cel-\nlular organization of both roots and\nshoots shows a radial organization (i.e. a\npattern from the inside to the outside) but\nthe cells show few changes as you move up or down a root or shoot, except in the region\nclose to the root or shoot tip where the cells are younger and have yet to develop some\nfeatures. Given the proper stimulus, at least some of the shoots will develop into clusters\nof flowers (inflorescences) that will develop into fruits containing seeds. Grasses only\nexhibit primary growth, the growth resulting from the embryonic regions at the tips of\nroots and shoots, including branch shoots and branch roots. There is no secondary\ngrowth, growth that makes the roots and shoots of some plants wider and woody. Like\nmost grasses, the wheat apical meristem does not elongate until the time of flowering and 800 | WHEAT\nmost leaves that the stem produces elongate before the main stem, producing what\nappears to be a stem but is actually a series of cylindrical leaf bases extending from the\nstill unelongated stem.\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn aanndd sseexx\nWheat reproduces sexually in a manner typical of flowering plants. Seeds develop from\nthe fertilized ovules present in the ovaries of flowers. All grasses produce flowers that\nhave a single ovule per ovary and this develops into a one-seeded fruit with the fruit\nwall fused to the seed coat. A wheat seed consists of three parts: the embryo, stored food\n(endosperm) and a seed coat fused with with the fruit wall. These components are impor-\ntant to human nutrition. White flour is produced after milling the grains to remove: (1)\nthe embryo, which is sold separately as wheat germ, (2) the seed coat / fruit coat, which\nis sold separately as wheat bran. The remaining endosperm is primarily starch but does\ncontain roughly 10% protein, including two proteins that combine to form gluten as flour\nand water mixtures (dough) are massaged (i.e. kneaded). The germ represents only a small\npart of the fruit but it contains substantial amounts of protein, fats, minerals and vita-\nmins. The bran is largely indigestible fiber but it does contain some protein and fat. This\nis what makes whole-wheat flour \u2018more nutritious\u2019, i.e. more protein, minerals, vitamins\nand fat than white flour. Unfortunately, \u2018more nutritious\u2019 also applies to fungi and bacte-\nria; and whole wheat flour is considerably more likely to spoil than white flour, which is\npart of the reason white flour became favored. Other reasons were white flour\u2019s improved\nbaking qualities and the ideal of \u2018purity\u2019.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd EEnneerrggyy\nWheat is a typical photosynthetic autotroph. Individual plants accumulate carbon diox-\nide from the atmosphere and use it to form carbohydrates that are both used to enlarge\nthe plant (i.e. grow) and also to be \u2018burned\u2019 in cellular respiration to provide energy for\nthe plant. Wheat is typical of seed plants, requiring 17 elements, carbon, hydrogen and\noxygen (acquired as water and carbon dioxide) , plus an additional 14 \u2018minerals\u2019 that are\nobtained from the soil solution by the root system. WHEAT | 801\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nThe most significant interactions of wheat are with humans who actively foster its growth\nby planting it and culturing it. Like many crop species (but not like most plants) it is an\n\u2018annual\u2019 species: it has a finite lifetime that is less than a year, resulting from the fact that\nthe shoot apical meristem is converted into a flowering meristem within a year of plant-\ning. Once the conversion to a flowering meristem occurs, no further growth of the shoot\nis possible. Moreover, as flowers and fruits develop, the nutrients in the existing plant\nstructure, especially leaves, are mobilized and delivered to the developing seeds, provid- 802 | WHEAT\ning them with nutrients but eliminating the ability of leaves to photosynthesize. Wheat\ncan be harvested in as little as 100 days after planting, and can be planted in late spring\nand harvested in late summer (\u2018spring wheat\u2019) or can be planted in the fall and harvested\nin the late spring or summer (\u2018winter wheat\u2019). The inter wheat varieties need a cold treat-\nment (\u2018vernalization treatment\u2019) to induce flowering.\nImportant to the interaction between wheat and humans are interactions between wheat\nand:\n1. climatic and soil conditions\u2013wheat grows best in \u2018temperate\u2019 regions, i.e. not in the\ntropics or in arctic regions. It can tolerate relatively dry conditions but does not\nhandle flooding well.\n2. herbivores \u2014 a number of insect herbivores can drastically affect wheat growth and\nyield\n3. diseases \u2014 a variety of diseases, caused by fungi, bacteria and other agents affect\nwheat growth. These diseases are trophic in nature and could be considered para-\nsites, because the disease causing organism is eating the plant.\nWatch\nOne or more interactive elements has been\nexcluded from this version of the text.

Many are planted as ornamental\nplants and they are commonly used in landscaping and gardens. The group is known for\nhydridization, polyploidy and subsequent speciation which accounts for the large number\nof species (see discussion of speciation through polyploidy in Chapter 28).\nTTaaxxoonnoommyy aanndd PPhhyyllooggeennyy\nWood ferns are members of the Pterophyta, the fern group, which includes ferns, horse-\ntails and wisk ferns. Most observers recognize ten orders within the group, the largest of\nthese is the Polypodiales, which contains roughly 80% of the roughly 12,000 species put in\nthe Pterophyta and is the order that contains the Dryopteridaceae, the family of roughly\n1700 species that contains Dryopteris. Among other features that unite the Polypodiales\nis a sporangium with a band of cells, the annulus, that is interrupted by the stalk that\nattaches the sporangium to the fern leaf.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nWood ferns have an underground stem\n(rhizome) from which emerge the leaves.\nIn most of the wood ferns the leaves are\nproduced in clusters that produce an urn-\nlike, circular groups of leaves.

WOOD FERNS | 805\nRReepprroodduuccttiioonn\nLike all plants, wood ferns exhibits alternation of generations with a visible sporophyte\nand hard-to-find bisexual gametophyte that is small, uncommonly seen, and quickly over\ngrown by the sporophyte that grows out from the archegonia. Sperm are flagellated and\nswim to the egg.\nThe sporangia of all ferns in the Polypodiales are small stalked structures less than a mil-\nlimeter tall. They have a band of specialized cells,\ncalled an annulus (red arrow on the top), that run,\nstarting at the stalk, around roughly 80% of the cir-\ncumference of the sporangium. As the sporangium\nstarts to dry the sporangium splits between two cells\njust below the annulus (green arrow, on the right). The\ncells of the annulus have specialized thickenings that\ncan store energy as the sporangia dries and the annu-\nlus shortens to fully open the sporangium. The shrink-\nage generates a tension in the annulus that eventually\novercomes the strength of water columns that are\nholding the annulus together. When the water\ncolumns break, the top of the sporangium rapidly\nsnaps back, dispersing the spores into the air.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nWood ferns (both the sporophyte and gametophyte) are a typical photoautotroph s, using\nthe energy of sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and then using\nthe carbohydrates as an energy source in cellular respiration and as building materials to\nsynthesize a variety of biomolecules. In addition to the water and carbon dioxide needed\nto make carbohydrates, plants require an additional 14 elements, absorbed from the soil\nwhere they are present in dilute amounts, requiring the roots to \u2018mine\u2019 the soil. 806 | WOOD FERNS\nIInntteerraaccttiioonnss\nWood ferns contains a number of toxins and are rarely grazed by mammals but are eaten\nby some caterpillars.

It also is extremely impor-\ntant as a \u2018model organism\u2019 in biology. It\nwas the first eukaryote to have its entire\ngenome sequenced and studies using S.\ncervisiae have been highly significant in\ndeveloping our understanding of meiosis,\nmitosis, cancer and a wide variety of cel-\nlular phenomena.\nIn both scientific experimentation and\nbread/beer making what makes yeast particularly useful is the fact that it is easily cul-\ntured\u2014it can be readily grown (i.e. it is not fussy about growth conditions) and is easy to\nkeep alive/viable (i.e. it is tough to kill) and actually can be kept viable under what is often\nconsidered harsh conditions \u2014 cooling, freezing, drying. In bread making what is needed\nis an organism to make carbon dioxide gas which \u2018leavens\u2019 dough, releasing carbon diox-\nide gas into a matrix of hydrated starch and protein molecules (bread dough), thereby\nproducing a product with a light, aerated texture. Leavening can be accomplished chem-\nically using baking powder or by adding an organism that generates carbon dioxide.\nNearly any organism does this but yeast does it rapidly and predictably. Moreover it is\nrelatively easy to keep yeast around even when not baking.\nYeast\u2019s role in beer making requires specific abilities that not all organisms possess. The\ntranslation of the scientific name is: saccharo = sugar, myces = fungus, cerevisiae = beer,\nreflecting its ability to make beer (an alcoholic beverage) out of sugar water. It accom-\nplishes this feat by carrying out a processes termed fermentation, an anaerobic respiration YEAST | 809\nprocess that releases carbon dioxide while converting six-carbon sugars (glucose and/or\nfructose) into ethanol. While a number of organisms can do this, yeast is easy to culture,\ncan grow rapidly, and its behavior is predictable\nPPhhyyllooggeennyy aanndd ttaaxxoonnoommyy\nThe name yeast is a morphological term referring to unicellular fungi. Used in this context\nit does not relate at all to phylogeny. Convergent evolution has resulted in unicellular\nfungi in several different groups including Zygomycetes (bread molds), Basidiomycetes\n(club fungi) and Ascomycetes (cup fungi). Most unicellular fungi (yeasts) are ascomycetes\nbut even within this phylum there are yeasts that are not closely related. Commer-\ncial yeast (Saccaromyces cervisiae) is an ascomycete, as is fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces\npombe), another yeast used in brewing and also an important model organism with its\nentire genome sequenced. Although fission yeast and baker\u2019s yeast have a similar ecology\nand are in the same phylum they are not closely related, having diverged from each other\nover 300 \u2013 1000 million years ago.\nSSttrruuccttuurree\nYeasts in general are unicellular fungi and in form and size very similar to bacteria. Like all\nfungi, they have a cell wall composed of chitin and possess a nucleus and other organelles,\nin particular, mitochondria. In many ways they represent fungi that have evolved to\nbecome \u2018bacteria-like\u2019 in their form and ecology. Baker\u2019s yeast is typical of yeasts in gen-\nerally \u2014 they typically are roughly spherical and around 5 um in diameter. 810 | YEAST\nSSeexx aanndd rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\nBrewer\u2019s yeast primarily reproduces asexually, by \u2018bud-\nding\u2019, which is basically cell division but where the\ndaughter cell starts as an outgrowth (bud) of the parent\ncell and eventually separates. Brewer\u2019s (and fission) yeast\nare capable of sex when the diploid cells undergo meio-\nsis, forming cells that can fuse with each other (i.e. serve\nas gametes) to restore the diploid condition. Both fission\nyeast and commercial yeast can occur as haploid or\ndiploid cultures. Haploid cultures can be maintained by\nnot bringing together different mating strains, while\ndiploid cultures can be maintained because specific cul-\nture conditions (nitrogen starvation) are needed to bring\nabout meiosis. When haploid cells of different mating\nstrains encounter each other, chemical communication (pheromones) trigger the produc-\ntion of extensions (\u2018Shmoo\u2019s\u2019) that allow cells to fuse with each other (plasmogamy). In the\ndiagram above the blue \u2018a\u2019 strain produces a mobile chemical (pheromone) designated by\nthe blue circles and has receptors (red \u2018football goalposts\u2019) that can bind the pheromone\n(red squares) produced by red \u2018alpha\u2019 strain. Similarly, the red alpha strain has receptors\nfor the pheromone produced by the blue \u2018a\u2019 strain. In both strains the binding of\npheromones produced by compatible strains induces the production of a schmoo and the\neventual creation of a diploid cell.\nMMaatttteerr aanndd eenneerrggyy\nSaccharomyces is a heterotroph with a sweet tooth \u2014 it prefers living off of simple sugars,\nalthough some strains can breakdown sugar polymers, e.g. starch, into simple sugars,\nthereby broadening its diet. Its mineral needs are obtained by absorbing small organic\nmolecules (amino acids) and minerals like phosphate. Various strains differ in their ability\nto breakdown organic matter and absorb and metabolize nutrients; these features may be\nuseful in genetic/cell biology experiments.
