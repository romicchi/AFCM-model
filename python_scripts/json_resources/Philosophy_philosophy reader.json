SKEPTICISM\nPhilosophy1\nPhilosophy (from Greek \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, philosophia, literally \"love of wisdom\") is the study of general and\nfundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and\nlanguage. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 \u2013 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods\ninclude questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic\nphilosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real?\nHowever, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best\nway to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\nHistorically, \"philosophy\" encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek\nphilosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, \"natural philosophy\" encompassed astronomy, medicine and\nphysics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became\nclassified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led\nacademic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era, some\ninvestigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including\npsychology, sociology, linguistics and economics.\nOther investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of\nphilosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or just\none? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy? Major sub-fields of academic philosophy\ninclude metaphysics (\"concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being\"), epistemology\n(about the \"nature and grounds of knowledge [and]...its limits and validity\" ), ethics, aesthetics, political\nphilosophy, logic, philosophy of science and the history of Western philosophy.\nSince the 20th century professional philosophers contribute to society primarily as professors,\nresearchers and writers. However, many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate\nprograms contribute in the fields of law, journalism, politics, religion, science, business and various art\nand entertainment activities.\nIntroduction\nKnowledge\nTraditionally, the term \"philosophy\" referred to any body of knowledge. In this sense, philosophy is\nclosely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education and politics. Newton's 1687\n\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\" is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics; he used\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

Natural philosophy has split into the various natural\nsciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and cosmology. Moral philosophy has\nbirthed the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political\nphilosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and\nphilosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.\nPhilosophical progress\nMany philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today. Colin McGinn and others\nclaim that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval. Chalmers and others, by contrast,\nsee progress in philosophy similar to that in science, while Talbot Brewer argued that \"progress\" is the\nwrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.\nHistorical overview\nIn one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture and a search for\nknowledge. In that sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as \"how are\nwe to live\" and \"what is the nature of reality\". A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then,\nfinds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality and life in all world civilizations.\nWestern philosophy\nWestern philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and dates to Pre-Socratic\nthinkers who were active in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BC such as Thales (c. 624 \u2013 c. 546 BC)\nand Pythagoras (c. 570 \u2013 c. 495 BC) who practiced a \"love of wisdom\" (philosophia) and were also\ntermed physiologoi (students of physis, or nature). Socrates was a very influential philosopher, who\ninsisted that he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom. Western philosophy can be divided\ninto three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman), Medieval philosophy (Christian European), and Modern\nphilosophy.\nThe Ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which arose out of the various pupils of\nSocrates, such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy, and was one of the most influential Greek\nthinkers for the whole of Western thought. Plato's student Aristotle was also extremely influential,\nfounding the Peripatetic school. Other traditions include Cynicism, Stoicism, Greek Skepticism and\nEpicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competing theories\nUNIT ONE: KNOWLEDGE AND SKEPTICISMUNIT ONE: KNOWLEDGE AND SKEPTICISM 2 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nsuch as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility\nof knowledge and the nature of reason (logos). With the rise of the Roman empire, Greek philosophy\nwas also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca.\nMedieval philosophy (5th \u2013 16th century) is the period following the fall of the Roman empire and was\ndominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects Judeo-Christian theological concerns as well as\nretaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of God, the\nnature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil were discussed in this period. Some key\nMedieval thinkers include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon.\nPhilosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to Theology (ancilla theologiae) and hence they\nsought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the\ndevelopment of Scholasticism, a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close\nreading and disputation on key texts. The Renaissance (1355\u20131650) period saw increasing focus on\nclassic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust Humanism.\nEarly modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9\nDescartes (1596\u20131650). Following the rise of natural science, Modern philosophy was concerned with\ndeveloping a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures\nof authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include\nSpinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. 19th-century philosophy is influenced by the wider\nmovement termed the Enlightenment, and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German\nidealism, Nietzsche a famed anti-Christian, J.S. Mill who promoted Utilitarianism, Karl Marx who\ndeveloped the foundations for Communism and the American William James. The 20th century saw the\nsplit between Analytic philosophy and Continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as\nPhenomenology, Existentialism, Logical Positivism, Pragmatism and the Linguistic turn.\nUNIT ONE: KNOWLEDGE AND SKEPTICISMUNIT ONE: KNOWLEDGE AND SKEPTICISM 3 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n1\nIntroduction to Philosophy and Arguments\nArgument1\nIn philosophy and logic, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of\nsomething or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion. The general form of an argument in a natural\nlanguage is that of premises (typically in the form of propositions, statements or sentences) in support of\na claim: the conclusion. The structure of some arguments can also be set out in a formal language, and\nformally defined \"arguments\" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math,\nlogic, and computer science.\nIn a typical deductive argument, the premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion, while in an\ninductive argument, they are thought to provide reasons supporting the conclusion's probable truth. The\nstandards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth,\nfor example, the persuasiveness of so-called \"indispensability claims\" in transcendental arguments, the\nquality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.\nThe standards and criteria used in evaluating arguments and their forms of reasoning are studied in\nlogic. Ways of formulating arguments effectively are studied in rhetoric (see also: argumentation\ntheory). An argument in a formal language shows the logical form of the symbolically represented or\nnatural language arguments obtained by its interpretations.\nFormal and informal\nInformal arguments as studied in informal logic, are presented in ordinary language and are intended for\neveryday discourse. Conversely, formal arguments are studied in formal logic (historically called\nsymbolic logic, more commonly referred to as mathematical logic today) and are expressed in a formal\nlanguage. Informal logic may be said to emphasize the study of argumentation, whereas formal logic\nemphasizes implication and inference. Informal arguments are sometimes implicit. That is, the rational\nstructure \u2013 the relationship of claims, premises, warrants, relations of implication, and conclusion \u2013 is\nnot always spelled out and immediately visible and must sometimes be made explicit by analysis.\nStandard types\nThere are several kinds of arguments in logic, the best-known of which are \"deductive\" and \"inductive.\"\nAn argument has one or more premises but only one conclusion. Each premise and the conclusion are\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. Citation: Argument. (2016, December 14). In\nWikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

These truth\nvalues bear on the terminology used with arguments.\nDeductive arguments\n\u2022 A deductive argument asserts that the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the\npremises. Based on the premises, the conclusion follows necessarily (with certainty). For\nexample, given premises that A=B and B=C, then the conclusion follows necessarily that A=C.\nDeductive arguments are sometimes referred to as \"truth-preserving\" arguments.\n\u2022 A deductive argument is said to be valid or invalid. If one assumes the premises to be true\n(ignoring their actual truth values), would the conclusion follow with certainty? If yes, the\nargument is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid. In determining validity, the structure of the argument\nis essential to the determination, not the actual truth values. For example, consider the argument\nthat because bats can fly (premise=true), and all flying creatures are birds (premise=false),\ntherefore bats are birds (conclusion=false). If we assume the premises are true, the conclusion\nfollows necessarily, and thus it is a valid argument.\n\u2022 If a deductive argument is valid and its premises are all true, then it is also referred to as sound.\nOtherwise, it is unsound, as in the \"bats are birds\" example.\nInductive arguments\n\u2022 An inductive argument, on the other hand, asserts that the truth of the conclusion is supported to\nsome degree of probability by the premises. For example, given that the U.S. military budget is\nthe largest in the world (premise=true), then it is probable that it will remain so for the next 10\nyears (conclusion=true). Arguments that involve predictions are inductive, as the future is\nuncertain.\n\u2022 An inductive argument is said to be strong or weak. If the premises of an inductive argument are\nassumed true, is it probable the conclusion is also true? If so, the argument is strong. Otherwise,\nit is weak.\n\u2022 A strong argument is said to be cogent if it has all true premises. Otherwise, the argument is\nuncogent. The military budget argument example above is a strong, cogent argument.\nDeductive\nA deductive argument is one that, if valid, has a conclusion that is entailed by its premises. In other\nwords, the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises\u2014if the premises are true,\nthen the conclusion must be true. It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny the\nconclusion, because the negation of the conclusion is contradictory to the truth of the premises.\nValidity\nDeductive arguments may be either valid or invalid. If an argument is valid, it is a valid deduction, and\nif its premises are true, the conclusion must be true: a valid argument cannot have true premises and a\nfalse conclusion.\n1 Introduction to Philosophy and Arguments 5 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nAn argument is formally valid if and only if the denial of the conclusion is incompatible with accepting\nall the premises.\nThe validity of an argument depends, however, not on the actual truth or falsity of its premises and\nconclusion, but solely on whether or not the argument has a valid logical form. The validity of an\nargument is not a guarantee of the truth of its conclusion. Under a given interpretation, a valid argument\nmay have false premises that render it inconclusive: the conclusion of a valid argument with one or more\nfalse premises may be either true or false.\nLogic seeks to discover the valid forms, the forms that make arguments valid. A form of argument is\nvalid if and only if the conclusion is true under all interpretations of that argument in which the premises\nare true. Since the validity of an argument depends solely on its form, an argument can be shown to be\ninvalid by showing that its form is invalid. This can be done by giving a counter example of the same\nform of argument with premises that are true under a given interpretation, but a conclusion that is false\nunder that interpretation. In informal logic this is called a counter argument.\nThe form of argument can be shown by the use of symbols. For each argument form, there is a\ncorresponding statement form, called a corresponding conditional, and an argument form is valid if and\nonly if its corresponding conditional is a logical truth. A statement form which is logically true is also\nsaid to be a valid statement form. A statement form is a logical truth if it is true under all interpretations.\nA statement form can be shown to be a logical truth by either (a) showing that it is a tautology or (b) by\nmeans of a proof procedure.\nThe corresponding conditional of a valid argument is a necessary truth (true in all possible worlds) and\nso the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, or follows of logical necessity. The conclusion\nof a valid argument is not necessarily true, it depends on whether the premises are true. If the\nconclusion, itself, just so happens to be a necessary truth, it is so without regard to the premises.\nSome examples:\n\u2022 All Greeks are human and all humans are mortal; therefore, all Greeks are mortal. : Valid\nargument; if the premises are true the conclusion must be true.\n\u2022 Some Greeks are logicians and some logicians are tiresome; therefore, some Greeks are\ntiresome. Invalid argument: the tiresome logicians might all be Romans (for example).\n\u2022 Either we are all doomed or we are all saved; we are not all saved; therefore, we are all\ndoomed. Valid argument; the premises entail the conclusion. (Remember that this does not mean\nthe conclusion has to be true; it is only true if the premises are true, which they may not be!)\n\u2022 Some men are hawkers. Some hawkers are rich. Therefore, some men are rich. Invalid argument.\nThis can be easier seen by giving a counter-example with the same argument form:\no Some people are herbivores. Some herbivores are zebras. Therefore, some people are\nzebras. Invalid argument, as it is possible that the premises be true and the conclusion\nfalse.\nIn the above second to last case (Some men are hawkers...), the counter-example follows the same\nlogical form as the previous argument, (Premise 1: \"Some X are Y.\" Premise 2: \"Some Y are Z.\"\n1 Introduction to Philosophy and Arguments 6 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nConclusion: \"Some X are Z.\") in order to demonstrate that whatever hawkers may be, they may or may\nnot be rich, in consideration of the premises as such. (See also, existential import).\nThe forms of argument that render deductions valid are well-established, however some invalid\narguments can also be persuasive depending on their construction (inductive arguments, for example).\n(See also, formal fallacy and informal fallacy).\nSoundness\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose conclusion follows from its premise(s), and the premise(s)\nof which is/are true.\nInductive\nNon-deductive logic is reasoning using arguments in which the premises support the conclusion but do\nnot entail it. Forms of non-deductive logic include the statistical syllogism, which argues from\ngeneralizations true for the most part, and induction, a form of reasoning that makes generalizations\nbased on individual instances. An inductive argument is said to be cogent if and only if the truth of the\nargument's premises would render the truth of the conclusion probable (i.e., the argument is strong), and\nthe argument's premises are, in fact, true. Cogency can be considered inductive logic's analogue to\ndeductive logic's \"soundness.\" Despite its name, mathematical induction is not a form of inductive\nreasoning. The lack of deductive validity is known as the problem of induction.\nDefeasible arguments and argumentation schemes\nIn modern argumentation theories, arguments are regarded as defeasible passages from premises to a\nconclusion. Defeasibility means that when additional information (new evidence or contrary arguments)\nis provided, the premises may be no longer lead to the conclusion (non-monotonic reasoning). This type\nof reasoning is referred to as defeasible reasoning. For instance we consider the famous Tweedy\nexample:\nTweedy is a bird.\nBirds generally fly.\nTherefore, Tweedy (probably) flies.\nThis argument is reasonable and the premises support the conclusion unless additional information\nindicating that the case is an exception comes in. If Tweedy is a penguin, the inference is no longer\njustified by the premise. Defeasible arguments are based on generalizations that hold only in the\nmajority of cases, but are subject to exceptions and defaults. In order to represent and assess defeasible\nreasoning, it is necessary to combine the logical rules (governing the acceptance of a conclusion based\non the acceptance of its premises) with rules of material inference, governing how a premise can support\na given conclusion (whether it is reasonable or not to draw a specific conclusion from a specific\ndescription of a state of affairs). Argumentation schemes have been developed to describe and assess the\nacceptability or the fallaciousness of defeasible arguments. Argumentation schemes are stereotypical\npatterns of inference, combining semantic-ontological relations with types of reasoning and logical\naxioms and representing the abstract structure of the most common types of natural arguments. The\n1 Introduction to Philosophy and Arguments 7 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nargumentation schemes provided in (Walton, Reed & Macagno, 2008) describe tentatively the patterns\nof the most typical arguments. However, the two levels of abstraction are not distinguished. For this\nreason, under the label of \u201cargumentation schemes\u201d fall indistinctly patterns of reasoning such as the\nabductive, analogical, or inductive ones, and types of argument such as the ones from classification or\ncause to effect. A typical example is the argument from expert opinion, which has two premises and a\nconclusion.\nMajor Premise: Source E is an expert in subject domain S containing proposition A.\nMinor Premise: E asserts that proposition A is true (false).\nConclusion: A is true (false).\nEach scheme is associated to a set of critical questions, namely criteria for assessing dialectically the\nreasonableness and acceptability of an argument. The matching critical questions are the standard ways\nof casting the argument into doubt.\nCQ1: Expertise Question. How credible is E as an expert source?\nCQ2: Field Question. Is E an expert in the field that A is in?\nCQ3: Opinion Question. What did E assert that implies A?\nCQ4: Trustworthiness Question. Is E personally reliable as a source?\nCQ5: Consistency Question. Is A consistent with what other experts assert?\nCQ6: Backup Evidence Question. Is E's assertion based on evidence?\nIf an expert says that a proposition is true, this provides a reason for tentatively accepting it, in the\nabsence of stronger reasons to doubt it. But suppose that evidence of financial gain suggests that the\nexpert is biased, for example by evidence showing that he will gain financially from his claim.\nBy analogy\nArgument by analogy may be thought of as argument from the particular to particular. An argument by\nanalogy may use a particular truth in a premise to argue towards a similar particular truth in the\nconclusion. For example, if A. Plato was mortal, and B. Socrates was like Plato in other respects, then\nasserting that C. Socrates was mortal is an example of argument by analogy because the reasoning\nemployed in it proceeds from a particular truth in a premise (Plato was mortal) to a similar particular\ntruth in the conclusion, namely that Socrates was mortal.\nOther kinds\nOther kinds of arguments may have different or additional standards of validity or justification. For\nexample, Charles Taylor writes that so-called transcendental arguments are made up of a \"chain of\nindispensability claims\" that attempt to show why something is necessarily true based on its connection\nto our experience, while Nikolas Kompridis has suggested that there are two types of \"fallible\"\narguments: one based on truth claims, and the other based on the time-responsive disclosure of\npossibility (see world disclosure). The late French philosopher Michel Foucault is said to have been a\nprominent advocate of this latter form of philosophical argument.\n1 Introduction to Philosophy and Arguments 8 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nIn informal logic\nArgument is an informal calculus, relating an effort to be performed or sum to be spent, to possible\nfuture gain, either economic or moral. In informal logic, an argument is a connexion between\na. an individual action\nb. through which a generally accepted good is obtained.\nEx :\n1.\na. You should marry Jane (individual action, individual decision)\nb. because she has the same temper as you. (generally accepted wisdom that marriage is\ngood in itself, and it is generally accepted that people with the same character get along\nwell).\n2.\na. You should not smoke (individual action, individual decision)\nb. because smoking is harmful (generally accepted wisdom that health is good).\nThe argument is neither a) advice nor b) moral or economical judgement, but the connection between\nthe two. An argument always uses the connective because. An argument is not an explanation. It does\nnot connect two events, cause and effect, which already took place, but a possible individual action and\nits beneficial outcome. An argument is not a proof. A proof is a logical and cognitive concept; an\nargument is a praxeologic concept. A proof changes our knowledge; an argument compels us to act.[]\nLogical status\nArgument does not belong to logic, because it is connected to a real person, a real event, and a real effort\nto be made.\n1. If you, John, will buy this stock, it will become twice as valuable in a year.\n2. If you, Mary, study dance, you will become a famous ballet dancer.\nThe value of the argument is connected to the immediate circumstances of the person spoken to. If, in\nthe first case,(1) John has no money, or will die the next year, he will not be interested in buying the\nstock. If, in the second case (2) she is too heavy, or too old, she will not be interested in studying and\nbecoming a dancer. The argument is not logical, but profitable.\nWorld-disclosing\nWorld-disclosing arguments are a group of philosophical arguments that are said to employ a disclosive\napproach, to reveal features of a wider ontological or cultural-linguistic understanding \u2013 a \"world,\" in a\nspecifically ontological sense \u2013 in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and \"logical\nspace\" on which an argument implicitly depends.\n1 Introduction to Philosophy and Arguments 9 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nExplanations\nWhile arguments attempt to show that something was, is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try\nto show why or how something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of whether or not Fred's\ncat has fleas, Joe may state: \"Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe, the cat is scratching right now.\" Joe has\nmade an argument that the cat has fleas. However, if Joe asks Fred, \"Why is your cat scratching itself?\"\nthe explanation, \"...because it has fleas.\" provides understanding.\nBoth the above argument and explanation require knowing the generalities that a) fleas often cause\nitching, and b) that one often scratches to relieve itching. The difference is in the intent: an argument\nattempts to settle whether or not some claim is true, and an explanation attempts to provide\nunderstanding of the event. Note, that by subsuming the specific event (of Fred's cat scratching) as an\ninstance of the general rule that \"animals scratch themselves when they have fleas\", Joe will no longer\nwonder why Fred's cat is scratching itself. Arguments address problems of belief, explanations address\nproblems of understanding. Also note that in the argument above, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is\nup for debate (i.e. is a claim), but in the explanation, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is assumed to\nbe true (unquestioned at this time) and just needs explaining.\nArguments and explanations largely resemble each other in rhetorical use. This is the cause of much\ndifficulty in thinking critically about claims. There are several reasons for this difficulty.\n\u2022 People often are not themselves clear on whether they are arguing for or explaining something.\n\u2022 The same types of words and phrases are used in presenting explanations and arguments.\n\u2022 The terms 'explain' or 'explanation,' et cetera are frequently used in arguments.\n\u2022 Explanations are often used within arguments and presented so as to serve as arguments.\n\u2022 Likewise, \"...arguments are essential to the process of justifying the validity of any explanation\nas there are often multiple explanations for any given phenomenon.\"\nExplanations and arguments are often studied in the field of Information Systems to help explain user\nacceptance of knowledge-based systems. Certain argument types may fit better with personality traits to\nenhance acceptance by individuals.\nFallacies and nonarguments\nFallacies are types of argument or expressions which are held to be of an invalid form or contain errors\nin reasoning. There is not as yet any general theory of fallacy or strong agreement among researchers of\ntheir definition or potential for application but the term is broadly applicable as a label to certain\nexamples of error, and also variously applied to ambiguous candidates.\nIn Logic types of fallacy are firmly described thus: First the premises and the conclusion must be\nstatements, capable of being true or false. Secondly it must be asserted that the conclusion follows from\nthe premises. In English the words therefore, so, because and hence typically separate the premises from\nthe conclusion of an argument, but this is not necessarily so. Thus: Socrates is a man, all men are mortal\ntherefore Socrates is mortal is clearly an argument (a valid one at that), because it is clear it is asserted\nthat Socrates is mortal follows from the preceding statements. However I was thirsty and therefore I\n1 Introduction to Philosophy and Arguments 10 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\ndrank is NOT an argument, despite its appearance. It is not being claimed that I drank is logically\nentailed by I was thirsty. The therefore in this sentence indicates for that reason not it follows that.\nElliptical arguments\nOften an argument is invalid because there is a missing premise\u2014the supply of which would render it\nvalid. Speakers and writers will often leave out a strictly necessary premise in their reasonings if it is\nwidely accepted and the writer does not wish to state the blindingly obvious. Example: All metals\nexpand when heated, therefore iron will expand when heated. (Missing premise: iron is a metal). On the\nother hand, a seemingly valid argument may be found to lack a premise \u2013 a 'hidden assumption' \u2013 which\nif highlighted can show a fault in reasoning. Example: A witness reasoned: Nobody came out the front\ndoor except the milkman; therefore the murderer must have left by the back door. (Hidden assumptions-\nthe milkman was not the murderer, and the murderer has left by the front or back door).\n1 Introduction to Philosophy and Arguments 11 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n2\nThe \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars:\nYour Car\u2019s Moral Settings1\n\u201cWe have decided to put the moral decisions related to our crash-avoidance and self-driving\nfeatures into the hands of the consumer. After all, it is your vehicle and you will be behind the wheel. Or\nmaybe you won\u2019t be. Our proprietary system allows for you to customize all settings depending on who\nis in the vehicle, who is driving, and what conditions present themselves on the road,\u201d Bob, the\nsalesman, told Hillary.\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018moral decisions\u2019?\u201d Hillary asked.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a classic problem in philosophy known as \u2018The Trolley Problem\u2019 and it\u2019s a simple\nversion of a scenario we like to analyze to help determine your settings. Are you familiar with it? No? It\ncan help explain what we have in mind, so it\u2019s a good starting point. Let me show you how it works,\u201d\nBob said as he touched his screen a few times causing a holographic projection of a red trolley (the type\nthat were still in use on the streets of San Francisco) to appear on the table between them.\n\u201cYou see, this is a runaway trolley and it\u2019s flying downhill on the track. There\u2019s a fork ahead and\nit\u2019s headed toward the path to the right. You happen to be standing at the trolley tracks and your hand is\non the lever controlling the fork, so you can choose which track it goes down,\u201d Bob explained as the\nhologram zoomed out a little to reveal the fork in the tracks while a lever appeared in front of Hillary\nindicating the switch would currently send the trolley down the right path.\n\u201cOK, so what\u2019s the issue? There\u2019s no one in the trolley and I don\u2019t know where it wants to go, so\nwhat do I need to do?\u201d Hillary asked, a little intrigued by the simulation. She hadn\u2019t bought a car in\nyears and was unprepared for both the sophisticated level of technology in her potential vehicle and the\ntactics used by the salesmen.\n\u201cCorrect, there\u2019s no one in the trolley, but there are people down both of the tracks. You see, a\nmad philosopher \u2013 I know, bear with me, this was popularized by the philosopher Judith Jarvis\nThompson after all \u2013 has tied down a number of people. Specifically, there are 5 people on the track the\ntrolley is headed down and 1 on the other track,\u201d Bob said as the hologram zoomed out further to show\nthe situation. All 6 of the people on the tracks had indiscernible features to the point that Hillary\ncouldn\u2019t make out any details, not even general age or gender.\n\u201cNow, you have a decision to make,\u201d Bob continued as the trolley slowly rolled toward the fork.\n\u201cYou can do one of two things: nothing or pull the switch. If you do nothing, the trolley will kill the 5\npeople. If you act and pull the lever, then the trolley will switch tracks and kill the single person. What\nwill you do? All you need to do is pull that switch to change the track.\u201d\n\u201cThose can\u2019t be the only two options. Can I shout at those people? Untie them in time? Hop on\nthe trolley and pull the brakes? Put the switch in the middle so the trolley derails?\u201d she said as she\ndelicately moved the switch trying to get it to stick in the middle, having no luck.\n\u201cNope! There are only those two options. Anything else you try to do won\u2019t work, and will take\nup any time you have to make a decision which would mean the trolley will continue down its track and\nkill the 5 people. That's the point of this: you must choose between those two options,\u201d Bob said.\n1 Noah Levin, PhD, Associate Professor of Philosophy at Golden West College.

This work released under a CC-BY license.\n2 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings 12 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nHillary thought as the trolley continued on its path toward the fork. It didn\u2019t take her much\nlonger to deliberate, and she set the lever to the track with the 1 person on it.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kill 1 or 5, right? I\u2019d rather less people die. This is all really the fault of the \u2018Mad\nPhilosopher\u2019 anyway,\u201d she stated.\n\u201cMost people make the decision you just made, and for those same reasons. However, there\u2019s\nsomething to think about: rather than saving those 5 people, did you just kill 1? After all, that person\nwasn\u2019t going to die until you did anything,\u201d Bob asked.\n\u201cIn some sense, I suppose I did, but someone was going to die. If I didn\u2019t do anything, then those\n5 people would die, and there was something I could have done to prevent that. It\u2019s unfortunate for that\none person, but I\u2019d hope they would understand,\u201d she stated.\n\u201cThere are those people that believe there is a big moral difference between allowing something\nto happen and doing it yourself. But I can tell that you don\u2019t think so. Whatever happens in this situation\nis in your hands, and you\u2019re ultimately partly responsible for the results it would seem. That\u2019s why it\u2019s\nso important that you think about what settings you want to use in your new car,\u201d Bob stated.\n\u201cBut what settings are there exactly? If it\u2019s just to choose how many people to save, then that\u2019s\neasy: save more people. Why wouldn\u2019t I pick that option?\u201d Hillary asked.\n\u201cGreat question! Let\u2019s change this up a little. Instead of the train heading down the track with the\n5 people, it\u2019s headed down the track with only 1 person,\u201d as Bob said this, the 5 people shifted to the\nother track in the hologram, but the track the trolley was headed down remained empty.\n\u201cNow, Hillary, I don\u2019t mean any offense by this, and I don\u2019t want you to be shocked, but we\u2019ve\nfound this to be very effective at helping you decide which settings are correct for you and your family,\u201d\nand, as he said this, a little girl just five-years-old appeared on the track the Trolley was headed down.\n\u201cVanessa? What is she doing there? Why is my daughter in your little game?!\u201d she shouted.\n\u201cMy apologies, I\u2019ll take her out,\u201d as he said this, the girl was replaced with a boy version of\nVanessa. \u201cYou get the point. What would you do if you had to choose between the life of your daughter\nand 5 strangers?\u201d Bob asked.\n\u201cWell, my daughter, of course! What kind of monster would kill their own child?\u201d Hillary\nshouted again.\n\u201cOf course you would save her. But remember what you had just said about saving more lives\nthan less \u2013 that only matters to you when you don\u2019t know anything about the people that might be killed.\nNow, I assure you, that there are people that choose to, sadly enough, sacrifice their own child to save\nthose 5 lives. It\u2019s not an easy decision to make, but they believe their child would want to make that\nsacrifice,\u201d Bob said, attempting to calm Hillary. He was clearly used to these sorts of reactions.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see what this has to do with my new car. When would my daughter be in the road\nand the only way to avoid her is by killing 5 strangers? And where am I? I\u2019m not even a part of this. I\u2019m\njust standing on the outside,\u201d Hillary asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right! You are not really involved in this situation, so it isn\u2019t exactly something that\nmight happen when you\u2019re driving your new car. This is why we\u2019ve devised a different scenario to help\nyou understand the actual options in our moral decision-making algorithm and choose the most\nappropriate parameters for your family. The Trolley Problem was just the beginning so you can better\nappreciate this scenario,\u201d Bob said as he began tapping at his screen once again. The holographic\nsimulation of the trolley disappeared and the minivan that Hillary was considering appeared driving\ndown a curvy mountain road.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s say you\u2019re out for a relaxing mountain drive. You need some time to yourself and\njust needed to get away, so you\u2019re blasting your favorite tunes on our 12-speaker award-winning sound\nsystem using our safety assist driving mode, which puts you in control but keeps an eye on things so that\n2 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings 13 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nyou don\u2019t get into an accident, not that you would, but just in case you lose yourself too much in your\nmusic, the car has you covered. Suddenly, you turn a corner and see a family of 5 standing in the middle\nof the road since they just emerged from their wrecked car when it hit a boulder that had recently fallen\noff the mountainside. They were driving a very old car that didn\u2019t have the latest auto-braking\ntechnologies, but had all thankfully survived with only minor injuries. You\u2019re in control of the wheel\nand have just enough time to react. You see that there are only 2 options: smash into the back of their car\nand risk serious injury to yourself or avoid it and hit the family. Plunging off the cliff would be certain\ndeath (we don\u2019t have ejection seats \u2013 yet!), so it\u2019s either hit the family or take your chances crashing.\nOur safety systems are topnotch and we receive the highest crash rating year after year. But you never\nknow what\u2019s going to happen in an accident like this. The family might be fine as well if you hit them or\nthey might jump out of the way in time, but they aren\u2019t surrounded by 7 different airbags like you are.\nNow, what would you do?\u201d As Bob explained the scenario, the hologram changed to match. Only\ninstead of a switch, there were two buttons in front of Hillary: one that said \u201cHit the car\u201d and another\nthat said \u201cHit the family.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but see my family standing there when I look at these people. I couldn\u2019t hit them, so\nI\u2019d take the chance on myself,\u201d Hillary said as she pushed the button indicating her choice. The\nhologram stopped just before impact.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite noble of you. But \u2013 now, again, don\u2019t be shocked \u2013 what if your family were in the\ncar with you? Let\u2019s keep it limited. Not your entire family, but just you and\u2026Vanessa, was it?\u201d Bob\nasked, now sounding more like a casket salesman than a car salesman.\n\u201cI can\u2019t risk her like I will risk myself. My job as a parent is to protect her. That family shouldn\u2019t\nhave been standing in the middle of the road anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t be entirely my fault,\u201d she stated,\nreassuring herself of her decision.\n\u201cOf course, I understand. From what you\u2019ve said, it sounds like you\u2019re interested in our most\npopular settings, which a full 91% of new car owners choose. There are a lot of options, but I can\nsummarize how it will work out in the real world for you, if you like,\u201d Bob said as a list with at least 50\ncheckboxes appeared in place of the simulation.\n\u201cPlease, go on,\u201d Hillary said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re willing to sacrifice yourself for the sake of others \u2013 again, that\u2019s very commendable of\nyou \u2013 and always want to save the most lives that you can, unless your family is on the line\u2013\u201d Bob said\nbefore Hillary interrupted him.\n\u201cNo, not my entire family, just children. Nephews, nieces, and any other kids included,\u201d Hillary\nclarified.\n\u201cAnd grandchildren someday, of course! My apologies, I misspoke. Yes, we will prioritize the\nlives of any children in your new vehicle, but count adults in your vehicle the same as those outside of it.\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic, should we also prioritize the lives of children outside the car as well? We can\nput whatever weighting on them you like when the system does its calculations in the unfortunate event\nof unavoidable catastrophe. Most customers opt for a 2:1 value ratio \u2013 minors count twice as much as\nadults. However, we do have customers that value the elderly at a higher rate. We can set the parameters\nhowever you want, and we need not make these decisions now,\u201d Bob said.\n\u201c2:1 for children under 15, and 1.5:1 for children between 16-21. Anyone older than that can\nfend for themselves,\u201d Hillary stated.\n\u201cYes, of course. You can always change your LVRs, Life Value Ratios, later, and tune them\nexactly to your liking based on whatever traits you choose to specify. There\u2019s even a specific setting for\nex-husbands!\u201d Bob joked. Hillary let out a forced chuckle.\n\u201cSorry, to continue, the system will prioritize the most lives, weighted to your specifications,\n2 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings 14 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nweighing adults inside and outside the vehicle the same, but giving a higher value to children, and\ngiving those in the car the highest values. There is also a setting that will give the occupants in the car\npriority in the event the algorithm results in a tie. Sound good?\u201d Bob explained.\n\u201cYes, that sounds quite good. Does a sunroof come standard?\u201d Hillary inquired. All this safety\ntalk was getting tedious, and she suddenly remembered how much she enjoyed the sunroof on her old\ncar.\n2 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings 15 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n3\nTheaetetus\nTheatetus1 (selected parts)\nThaeat. = Theaetetus\nSoc. = Socrates\nTheod. = Theodorus\nTheaet. I am eager enough, Socrates, if that would bring to light the truth.\nSoc. Come, you made a good beginning just now; let your own answer about roots be your model, and\nas you comprehended them all in one class, try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under one\ndefinition.\nTheaet. I can assure you, Socrates, that I have tried very often, when the report of questions asked by\nyou was brought to me; but I can neither persuade myself that I have a satisfactory answer to give, nor\nhear of any one who answers as you would have him; and I cannot shake off a feeling of anxiety.\nSoc. These are the pangs of labour, my dear Theaetetus; you have something within you which you are\nbringing to the birth.\nTheaet. I do not know, Socrates; I only say what I feel.\nSoc. And have you never heard, simpleton, that I am the son of a midwife, brave and burly, whose name\nwas Phaenarete?\nTheaet. Yes, I have.\nSoc. And that I myself practise midwifery?\nTheaet. No, never.\nSoc. Let me tell you that I do though, my friend: but you must not reveal the secret, as the world in\ngeneral have not found me out; and therefore they only say of me, that I am the strangest of mortals and\ndrive men to their wits' end. Did you ever hear that too?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. Shall I tell you the reason?\n1 Plato, 360 BCE, translated by Benjamin Jowett, 1892\n3 Theaetetus 16 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. By all means.\nSoc. Bear in mind the whole business of the mid-wives, and then you will see my meaning better:-No\nwoman, as you are probably aware, who is still able to conceive and bear, attends other women, but only\nthose who are past bearing.\nTheaet. Yes; I know.\nSoc. The reason of this is said to be that Artemis-the goddess of childbirth-is not a mother, and she\nhonours those who are like herself; but she could not allow the barren to be mid-wives, because human\nnature cannot know the mystery of an art without experience; and therefore she assigned this office to\nthose who are too old to bear.\nTheaet. I dare say.\nSoc. And I dare say too, or rather I am absolutely certain, that the mid-wives know better than others\nwho is pregnant and who is not?\nTheaet. Very true.\nSoc. And by the use of potions and incantations they are able to arouse the pangs and to soothe them at\nwill; they can make those bear who have a difficulty in bearing, and if they think fit they can smother\nthe embryo in the womb.\nTheaet. They can.\nSoc. Did you ever remark that they are also most cunning matchmakers, and have a thorough knowledge\nof what unions are likely to produce a brave brood?\nTheaet. No, never.\nSoc. Then let me tell you that this is their greatest pride, more than cutting the umbilical cord. And if\nyou reflect, you will see that the same art which cultivates and gathers in the fruits of the earth, will be\nmost likely to know in what soils the several plants or seeds should be deposited.\nTheaet. Yes, the same art.\nSoc. And do you suppose that with women the case is otherwise?\nTheaet. I should think not.\nSoc. Certainly not; but mid-wives are respectable women who have a character to lose, and they avoid\nthis department of their profession, because they are afraid of being called procuresses, which is a name\ngiven to those who join together man and woman in an unlawful and unscientific way; and yet the true\nmidwife is also the true and only matchmaker.\n3 Theaetetus 17 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. Clearly.\nSoc. Such are the mid-wives, whose task is a very important one but not so important as mine; for\nwomen do not bring into the world at one time real children, and at another time counterfeits which are\nwith difficulty distinguished from them; if they did, then the, discernment of the true and false birth\nwould be the crowning achievement of the art of midwifery-you would think so?\nTheaet. Indeed I should.\nSoc. Well, my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs; but differs, in that I attend men and not\nwomen; and look after their souls when they are in labour, and not after their bodies: and the triumph of\nmy art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which the mind of the young man brings forth is\na false idol or a noble and true birth. And like the mid-wives, I am barren, and the reproach which is\noften made against me, that I ask questions of others and have not the wit to answer them myself, is very\njust-the reason is, that the god compels-me to be a midwife, but does not allow me to bring forth. And\ntherefore I am not myself at all wise, nor have I anything to show which is the invention or birth of my\nown soul, but those who converse with me profit. Some of them appear dull enough at first, but\nafterwards, as our acquaintance ripens, if the god is gracious to them, they all make astonishing\nprogress; and this in the opinion of others as well as in their own. It is quite dear that they never learned\nanything from me; the many fine discoveries to which they cling are of their own making. But to me and\nthe god they owe their delivery. And the proof of my words is, that many of them in their ignorance,\neither in their self-conceit despising me, or falling under the influence of others, have gone away too\nsoon; and have not only lost the children of whom I had previously delivered them by an ill bringing up,\nbut have stifled whatever else they had in them by evil communications, being fonder of lies and shams\nthan of the truth; and they have at last ended by seeing themselves, as others see them, to be great fools.\nAristeides, the son of Lysimachus, is one of them, and there are many others. The truants often return to\nme, and beg that I would consort with them again-they are ready to go to me on their knees and then, if\nmy familiar allows, which is not always the case, I receive them, and they begin to grow again. Dire are\nthe pangs which my art is able to arouse and to allay in those who consort with me, just like the pangs of\nwomen in childbirth; night and day they are full of perplexity and travail which is even worse than that\nof the women. So much for them. And there are -others, Theaetetus, who come to me apparently having\nnothing in them; and as I know that they have no need of my art, I coax them into marrying some one,\nand by the grace of God I can generally tell who is likely to do them good. Many of them I have given\naway to Prodicus, and many to other inspired sages. I tell you this long story, friend Theaetetus, because\nI suspect, as indeed you seem to think yourself, that you are in labour-great with some conception. Come\nthen to me, who am a midwife's son and myself a midwife, and do your best to answer the questions\nwhich I will ask you. And if I abstract and expose your first-born, because I discover upon inspection\nthat the conception which you have formed is a vain shadow, do not quarrel with me on that account, as\nthe manner of women is when their first children are taken from them. For I have actually known some\nwho were ready to bite me when I deprived them of a darling folly; they did not perceive that I acted\nfrom good will, not knowing that no god is the enemy of man-that was not within the range of their\nideas; neither am I their enemy in all this, but it would be wrong for me to admit falsehood, or to stifle\nthe truth. Once more, then, Theaetetus, I repeat my old question, \"What is knowledge?\"-and do not say\nthat you cannot tell; but quit yourself like a man, and by the help of God you will be able to tell.\n3 Theaetetus 18 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. At any rate, Socrates, after such an exhortation I should be ashamed of not trying to do my best.\nNow he who knows perceives what he knows, and, as far as I can see at present, knowledge is\nperception.\nSoc. Bravely said, boy; that is the way in which you should express your opinion. And now, let us\nexamine together this conception of yours, and see whether it is a true birth or a mere, wind-egg:-You\nsay that knowledge is perception?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. Well, you have delivered yourself of a very important doctrine about knowledge; it is indeed the\nopinion of Protagoras, who has another way of expressing it, Man, he says, is the measure of all things,\nof the existence of things that are, and of the non-existence of things that are not:-You have read him?\nTheaet. O yes, again and again.\nSoc. Does he not say that things are to you such as they appear to you, and to me such as they appear to\nme, and that you and I are men?\nTheaet. Yes, he says so.\nSoc. A wise man is not likely to talk nonsense. Let us try to understand him: the same wind is blowing,\nand yet one of us may be cold and the other not, or one may be slightly and the other very cold?\nTheaet. Quite true.\nSoc. Now is the wind, regarded not in relation to us but absolutely, cold or not; or are we to say, with\nProtagoras, that the wind is cold to him who is cold, and not to him who is not?\nTheaet. I suppose the last.\nSoc. Then it must appear so to each of them?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. And \"appears to him\" means the same as \"he perceives.\"\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. Then appearing and perceiving coincide in the case of hot and cold, and in similar instances; for\nthings appear, or may be supposed to be, to each one such as he perceives them?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. Then perception is always of existence, and being the same as knowledge is unerring?\n3 Theaetetus 19 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. Clearly.\nSoc. In the name of the Graces, what an almighty wise man Protagoras must have been! He spoke these\nthings in a parable to the common herd, like you and me, but told the truth, his Truth, in secret to his\nown disciples.\nTheaet. What do you mean, Socrates?\nSoc. I am about to speak of a high argument, in which all things are said to be relative; you cannot\nrightly call anything by any name, such as great or small, heavy or light, for the great will be small and\nthe heavy light-there is no single thing or quality, but out of motion and change and admixture all things\nare becoming relatively to one another, which \"becoming\" is by us incorrectly called being, but is really\nbecoming, for nothing ever is, but all things are becoming. Summon all philosophers-Protagoras,\nHeracleitus, Empedocles, and the rest of them, one after another, and with the exception of Parmenides\nthey will agree with you in this. Summon the great masters of either kind of poetry-Epicharmus, the\nprince of Comedy, and Homer of Tragedy; when the latter sings of Ocean whence sprang the gods, and\nmother Tethys, does he not mean that all things are the offspring, of flux and motion?\nTheaet. I think so.\nSoc. And who could take up arms against such a great army having Homer for its general, and not\nappear ridiculous?\nTheaet. Who indeed, Socrates?\nSoc. Yes, Theaetetus; and there are plenty of other proofs which will show that motion is the source of\nwhat is called being and becoming, and inactivity of not-being and destruction; for fire and warmth,\nwhich are supposed to be the parent and guardian of all other things, are born of movement and friction,\nwhich is a kind of motion;-is not this the origin of fire?\nTheaet. It is.\nSoc. And the race of animals is generated in the same way?\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. And is not the bodily habit spoiled by rest and idleness, but preserved for a long time by motion\nand exercise?\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. And what of the mental habit? Is not the soul informed, and improved, and preserved by study and\nattention, which are motions; but when at rest, which in the soul only means want of attention and study,\nis uninformed, and speedily forgets whatever she has learned?\nTheaet. True.\n3 Theaetetus 20 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nSoc. Then motion is a good, and rest an evil, to the soul as well as to the body?\nTheaet. Clearly.\nSoc. I may add, that breathless calm, stillness and the like waste and impair, while wind and storm\npreserve; and the palmary argument of all, which I strongly urge, is the golden chain in Homer, by\nwhich he means the sun, thereby indicating that so long as the sun and the heavens go round in their\norbits, all things human and divine are and are preserved, but if they were chained up and their motions\nceased, then all things would be destroyed, and, as the saying is, turned upside down.\nTheaet. I believe, Socrates, that you have truly explained his meaning.\nSoc. Then now apply his doctrine to perception, my good friend, and first of all to vision; that which you\ncall white colour is not in your eyes, and is not a distinct thing which exists out of them. And you must\nnot assign any place to it: for if it had position it would be, and be at rest, and there would be no process\nof becoming.\nTheaet. Then what is colour?\nSoc. Let us carry the principle which has just been affirmed, that nothing is self-existent, and then we\nshall see that white, black, and every other colour, arises out of the eye meeting the appropriate motion,\nand that what we call a colour is in each case neither the active nor the passive element, but something\nwhich passes between them, and is peculiar to each percipient; are you quite certain that the several\ncolours appear to a dog or to any animal whatever as they appear to you?\nTheaet. Far from it.\nSoc. Or that anything appears the same to you as to another man? Are you so profoundly convinced of\nthis? Rather would it not be true that it never appears exactly the same to you, because you are never\nexactly the same?\nTheaet. The latter.\nSoc. And if that with which I compare myself in size, or which I apprehend by touch, were great or\nwhite or hot, it could not become different by mere contact with another unless it actually changed; nor\nagain, if the comparing or apprehending subject were great or white or hot, could this, when unchanged\nfrom within become changed by any approximation or affection of any other thing. The fact is that in\nour ordinary way of speaking we allow ourselves to be driven into most ridiculous and wonderful\ncontradictions, as Protagoras and all who take his line of argument would remark.\nTheaet. How? and of what sort do you mean?\nSoc. A little instance will sufficiently explain my meaning: Here are six dice, which are more by a half\nwhen compared with four, and fewer by a half than twelve-they are more and also fewer. How can you\nor any one maintain the contrary?\n3 Theaetetus 21 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. Very true.\nSoc. Well, then, suppose that Protagoras or some one asks whether anything can become greater or more\nif not by increasing, how would you answer him, Theaetetus?\nTheaet. I should say \"No,\" Socrates, if I were to speak my mind in reference to this last question, and if\nI were not afraid of contradicting my former answer.\nSoc. Capital excellent! spoken like an oracle, my boy! And if you reply \"Yes,\" there will be a case for\nEuripides; for our tongue will be unconvinced, but not our mind.\nTheaet. Very true.\nSoc. The thoroughbred Sophists, who know all that can be known about the mind, and argue only out of\nthe superfluity of their wits, would have had a regular sparring-match over this, and would -have\nknocked their arguments together finely. But you and I, who have no professional aims, only desire to\nsee what is the mutual relation of these principles-whether they are consistent with each or not.\nTheaet. Yes, that would be my desire.\nSoc. And mine too. But since this is our feeling, and there is plenty of time, why should we not calmly\nand patiently review our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us\nreally are? If I am not mistaken, they will be described by us as follows:-first, that nothing can become\ngreater or less, either in number or magnitude, while remaining equal to itself-you would agree?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. Secondly, that without addition or subtraction there is no increase or diminution of anything, but\nonly equality.\nTheaet. Quite true.\nSoc. Thirdly, that what was not before cannot be afterwards, without becoming and having become.\nTheaet. Yes, truly.\nSoc. These three axioms, if I am not mistaken, are fighting with one another in our minds in the case of\nthe dice, or, again, in such a case as this-if I were to say that I, who am of a certain height and taller than\nyou, may within a year, without gaining or losing in height, be not so tall-not that I should have lost, but\nthat you would have increased. In such a case, I am afterwards what I once was not, and yet I have not\nbecome; for I could not have become without becoming, neither could I have become less without losing\nsomewhat of my height; and I could give you ten thousand examples of similar contradictions, if we\nadmit them at all. I believe that you follow me, Theaetetus; for I suspect that you have thought of these\nquestions before now.\n3 Theaetetus 22 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. Yes, Socrates, and I am amazed when I think of them; by the Gods I am! and I want to know\nwhat on earth they mean; and there are times when my head quite swims with the contemplation of\nthem.\nSoc. I see, my dear Theaetetus, that Theodorus had a true insight into your nature when he said that you\nwere a philosopher, for wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder. He was\nnot a bad genealogist who said that Iris (the messenger of heaven) is the child of Thaumas (wonder). But\ndo you begin to see what is the explanation of this perplexity on the hypothesis which we attribute to\nProtagoras?\nTheaet. Not as yet.\nSoc. Then you will be obliged to me if I help you to unearth the hidden \"truth\" of a famous man or\nschool.\nTheaet. To be sure, I shall be very much obliged.\nSoc. Take a look round, then, and see that none of the uninitiated are listening. Now by the uninitiated I\nmean: the people who believe in nothing but what they can grasp in their hands, and who will not allow\nthat action or generation or anything invisible can have real existence.\nTheaet. Yes, indeed, Socrates, they are very hard and impenetrable mortals.\nSoc. Yes, my boy, outer barbarians. Far more ingenious are the brethren whose mysteries I am about to\nreveal to you. Their first principle is, that all is motion, and upon this all the affections of which we were\njust now speaking, are supposed to depend: there is nothing but motion, which has two forms, one active\nand the other passive, both in endless number; and out of the union and friction of them there is\ngenerated a progeny endless in number, having two forms, sense and the object of sense, which are ever\nbreaking forth and coming to the birth at the same moment. The senses are variously named hearing,\nseeing, smelling; there is the sense of heat, cold, pleasure, pain, desire, fear, and many more which have\nnames, as well as innumerable others which are without them; each has its kindred object each variety of\ncolour has a corresponding variety of sight, and so with sound and hearing, and with the rest of the\nsenses and the objects akin to them. Do you see, Theaetetus, the bearings of this tale on the preceding\nargument?\nTheaet. Indeed I do not.\nSoc. Then attend, and I will try to finish the story. The purport is that all these things are in motion, as I\nwas saying, and that this motion is of two kinds, a slower and a quicker; and the slower elements have\ntheir motions in the same place and with reference to things near them, and so they beget; but what is\nbegotten is swifter, for it is carried to fro, and moves from place to place. Apply this to sense:-When the\neye and the appropriate object meet together and give birth to whiteness and the sensation connatural\nwith it, which could not have been given by either of them going elsewhere, then, while the sight: is\nflowing from the eye, whiteness proceeds from the object which combines in producing the colour; and\nso the eye is fulfilled with sight, and really sees, and becomes, not sight, but a seeing eye; and the object\nwhich combined to form the colour is fulfilled with whiteness, and becomes not whiteness but a white\n3 Theaetetus 23 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nthing, whether wood or stone or whatever the object may be which happens to be colour,ed white. And\nthis is true of all sensible objects, hard, warm, and the like, which are similarly to be regarded, as I was\nsaying before, not as having any absolute existence, but as being all of them of whatever kind. generated\nby motion in their intercourse with one another; for of the agent and patient, as existing in separation, no\ntrustworthy conception, as they say, can be formed, for the agent has no existence until united; with the\npatient, and the patient has no existence until united with the agent; and that which by uniting with\nsomething becomes an agent, by meeting with some other thing is converted into a patient. And from all\nthese considerations, as I said at first, there arises a general reflection, that there is no one self-existent\nthing, but everything is becoming and in relation; and being must be altogether abolished, although from\nhabit and ignorance we are compelled even in this discussion to retain the use of the term. But great\nphilosophers tell us that we are not to allow either the word \"something,\" or \"belonging to something,\"\nor \"to me,\" or \"this,\" or \"that,\" or any other detaining name to be used, in the language of nature all\nthings are being created and destroyed, coming into being and passing into new forms; nor can any name\nfix or detain them; he who attempts to fix them is easily refuted. And this should be the way of speaking,\nnot only of particulars but of aggregates such aggregates as are expressed in the word \"man,\" or \"stone,\"\nor any name of animal or of a class. O Theaetetus, are not these speculations sweet as honey? And do\nyou not like the taste of them in the mouth?\nTheaet. I do not know what to say, Socrates, for, indeed, I cannot make out whether you are giving your\nown opinion or only wanting to draw me out.\nSoc. You forget, my friend, that I neither know, nor profess to know, anything of! these matters; you are\nthe person who is in labour, I am the barren midwife; and this is why I soothe you, and offer you one\ngood thing after another, that you may taste them. And I hope that I may at last help to bring your own\nopinion into the light of day: when this has been accomplished, then we will determine whether what\nyou have brought forth is only a wind-egg or a real and genuine birth. Therefore, keep up your spirits,\nand answer like a man what you think.\nTheaet. Ask me.\nSoc. Then once more: Is it your opinion that nothing is but what becomes? the good and the noble, as\nwell; as all the other things which we were just now mentioning?\nTheaet. When I hear you discoursing in this style, I think that there is a great deal in what you say, and I\nam very ready to assent.\nSoc. Let us not leave the argument unfinished, then; for there still remains to be considered an objection\nwhich may be raised about dreams and diseases, in particular about madness, and the various illusions of\nhearing and sight, or of other senses. For you know that in all these cases the esse-percipi theory appears\nto be unmistakably refuted, since in dreams and illusions we certainly have false perceptions; and far\nfrom saying that everything is which appears, we should rather say that nothing is which appears.\nTheaet. Very true, Socrates.\nSoc. But then, my boy, how can any one contend that knowledge is perception, or that to every man\nwhat appears is?\n3 Theaetetus 24 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. I am afraid to say, Socrates, that I have nothing to answer, because you rebuked me just now for\nmaking this excuse; but I certainly cannot undertake to argue that madmen or dreamers think truly, when\nthey imagine, some of them that they are gods, and others that they can fly, and are flying in their sleep.\nSoc. Do you see another question which can be raised about these phenomena, notably about dreaming\nand waking?\nTheaet. What question?\nSoc. A question which I think that you must often have heard persons ask:-How can you determine\nwhether at this moment we are sleeping, and all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and\ntalking to one another in the waking state?\nTheaet. Indeed, Socrates, I do not know how to prove the one any more than the other, for in both cases\nthe facts precisely correspond;-and there is no difficulty in supposing that during all this discussion we\nhave been talking to one another in a dream; and when in a dream we seem to be narrating dreams, the\nresemblance of the two states is quite astonishing.\nSoc. You see, then, that a doubt about the reality of sense is easily raised, since there may even be a\ndoubt whether we are awake or in a dream. And as our time is equally divided between sleeping and\nwaking, in either sphere of existence the soul contends that the thoughts which are present to our minds\nat the time are true; and during one half of our lives we affirm the truth of the one, and, during the other\nhalf, of the other; and are equally confident of both.\nTheaet. Most true.\nSoc. And may not the same be said of madness and other disorders? the difference is only that the times\nare not equal.\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. And is truth or falsehood to be determined by duration of time?\nTheaet. That would be in many ways ridiculous.\nSoc. But can you certainly determine: by any other means which of these opinions is true?\nTheaet. I do not think that I can.\nSoc. Listen, then to a statement of the other side of the argument, which is made by the champions of\nappearance. They would say, as I imagine-can that which is wholly other than something, have the same\nquality as that from which it differs? and observe, -Theaetetus, that the word \"other\" means not\n\"partially,\" but \"wholly other.\"\nTheaet. Certainly, putting the question as you do, that which is wholly other cannot either potentially or\n3 Theaetetus 25 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nin any other way be the same.\nSoc. And must therefore be admitted to be unlike?\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. If, then, anything happens to become like or unlike itself or another, when it becomes like we call it\nthe same-when unlike, other?\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. Were we not saying that there. are agents many and infinite, and patients many and infinite?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. And also that different combinations will produce results which are not the same, but different?\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. Let us take you and me, or anything as an example:-There is Socrates in health, and Socrates sick-\nAre they like or unlike?\nTheaet. You mean to, compare Socrates in health as a whole, and Socrates in sickness as a whole?\nSoc. Exactly; that is my meaning.\nTheaet. I answer, they are unlike.\nSoc. And if unlike, they are other?\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. And would you not say the same of Socrates sleeping and waking, or in any of the states which we\nwere mentioning?\nTheaet. I should.\nSoc. All agents have a different patient in Socrates, accordingly as he is well or ill.\nTheaet. Of course.\nSoc. And I who am the patient, and that which is the agent, will produce something different in each of\nthe two cases?\nTheaet. Certainly.\n3 Theaetetus 26 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nSoc. The wine which I drink when I am in health, appears sweet and pleasant to me?\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. For, as has been already acknowledged, the patient and agent meet together and produce sweetness\nand a perception of sweetness, which are in simultaneous motion, and the perception which comes from\nthe patient makes the tongue percipient, and the quality of sweetness which arises out of and is moving\nabout the wine, makes the wine, both to be and to appear sweet to the healthy tongue.\nTheaet. Certainly; that has been already acknowledged.\nSoc. But when I am sick, the wine really acts upon another and a different person?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. The combination of the draught of wine, and the Socrates who is sick, produces quite another\nresult; which is the sensation of bitterness in the tongue, and the, motion and creation of bitterness in and\nabout the wine, which becomes not bitterness but something bitter; as I myself become not but\npercipient?\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. There is no, other object of which I shall ever have the same perception, for another object would\ngive another perception, and would make the perception other and different; nor can that object which\naffects me, meeting another, subject, produce, the same, or become similar, for that too would produce\nanother result from another subject, and become different.\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. Neither can by myself, have this sensation, nor the object by itself, this quality.\nTheaet. Certainly not.\nSoc. When I perceive I must become percipient of something-there can be no such thing as perceiving\nand perceiving nothing; the object, whether it become sweet, bitter, or of any other quality, must have\nrelation to a percipient; nothing can become sweet which is sweet to no one.\nTheaet. Certainly not.\nSoc. Then the inference is, that we [the agent and patient] are or become in relation to one another; there\nis a law which binds us one to the other, but not to any other existence, nor each of us to himself; and\ntherefore we can only be bound to one another; so that whether a person says that a thing is or becomes,\nhe must say that it is or becomes to or of or in relation to something else; but he must not say or allow\nany one else to say that anything is or becomes absolutely: -such is our conclusion.\nTheaet. Very true, Socrates.\n3 Theaetetus 27 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nSoc. Then, if that which acts upon me has relation to me and to no other, I and no other am the\npercipient of it?\nTheaet. Of course.\nSoc. Then my perception is true to me, being inseparable from my own being; and, as Protagoras says,\nto myself I am judge of what is and-what is not to me.\nTheaet. I suppose so.\nSoc. How then, if I never err, and if my mind never trips in the conception of being or becoming, can I\nfail of knowing that which I perceive?\nTheaet. You cannot.\nSoc. Then you were quite right in affirming that knowledge is only perception; and the meaning turns\nout to be the same, whether with Homer and Heracleitus, and all that company, you say that all is motion\nand flux, or with the great sage Protagoras, that man is the measure of all things; or with Theaetetus,\nthat, given these premises, perception is knowledge. Am I not right, Theaetetus, and is not this your\nnewborn child, of which I have delivered you? What say you?\nTheaet. I cannot but agree, Socrates.\nSoc. Then this is the child, however he may turn out, which you and I have with difficulty brought into\nthe world. And now that he is born, we must run round the hearth with him, and see whether he is worth\nrearing, or is only a wind-egg and a sham. Is he to be reared in any case, and not exposed? or will you\nbear to see him rejected, and not get into a passion if I take away your first-born?\nTheod. Theaetetus will not be angry, for he is very good-natured. But tell me, Socrates, in heaven's\nname, is this, after all, not the truth?\nSoc. You, Theodorus, are a lover of theories, and now you innocently fancy that I am a bag full of them,\nand can easily pull one out which will overthrow its predecessor. But you do not see that in reality none\nof these theories come from me; they all come from him who talks with me. I only know just enough to\nextract them from the wisdom of another, and to receive them in a spirit of fairness. And now I shall say\nnothing myself, but shall endeavour to elicit something from our young friend.\nTheod. Do as you say, Socrates; you are quite right.\nSoc. Shall I tell you, Theodorus, what amazes me in your acquaintance Protagoras?\nTheod. What is it?\nSoc. I am charmed with his doctrine, that what appears is to each one, but I wonder that he did not begin\nhis book on Truth with a declaration that a pig or a dog-faced baboon, or some other yet stranger\n3 Theaetetus 28 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nmonster which has sensation, is the measure of all things; then he might have shown a magnificent\ncontempt for our opinion of him by informing us at the outset that while we were reverencing him like a\nGod for his wisdom he was no better than a tadpole, not to speak of his fellow-men-would not this have\nproduced an over-powering effect? For if truth is only sensation, and no man can discern another's\nfeelings better than he, or has any superior right to determine whether his opinion is true or false, but\neach, as we have several times repeated, is to himself the sole judge, and everything that he judges is\ntrue and right, why, my friend, should Protagoras be preferred to the place of wisdom and instruction,\nand deserve to be well paid, and we poor ignoramuses have to go to him, if each one is the measure of\nhis own wisdom? Must he not be talking ad captandum in all this? I say nothing of the ridiculous\npredicament in which my own midwifery and the whole art of dialectic is placed; for the attempt to\nsupervise or refute the notions or opinions of others would be a tedious and enormous piece of folly, if\nto each man his own are right; and this must be the case if Protagoras Truth is the real truth, and the\nphilosopher is not merely amusing himself by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book.\nTheod. He was a friend of mine, Socrates, as you were saying, and therefore I cannot have him refuted\nby my lips, nor can I oppose you when I agree with you; please, then, to take Theaetetus again; he\nseemed to answer very nicely.\nSoc. If you were to go into a Lacedaemonian palestra, Theodorus, would you have a right to look on at\nthe naked wrestlers, some of them making a poor figure, if you did not strip and give them an\nopportunity of judging of your own person?\nTheod. Why not, Socrates, if they would allow me, as I think you will in consideration of my age and\nstiffness; let some more supple youth try a fall with you, and do not drag me into the gymnasium.\nSoc. Your will is my will, Theodorus, as the proverbial philosophers say, and therefore I will return to\nthe sage Theaetetus: Tell me, Theaetetus, in reference to what I was saying, are you not lost in wonder,\nlike myself, when you find that all of a sudden you are raised to the level of the wisest of men, or indeed\nof the gods?-for you would assume the measure of Protagoras to apply to the gods as well as men?\nTheaet. Certainly I should, and I confess to you that I am lost in wonder. At first hearing, I was quite\nsatisfied with the doctrine, that whatever appears is to each one, but now the face of things has changed.\nSoc. Why, my dear boy, you are young, and therefore your ear is quickly caught and your mind\ninfluenced by popular arguments. Protagoras, or some one speaking on his behalf, will doubtless say in\nreply, good people, young and old, you meet and harangue, and bring in the gods, whose existence of\nnon-existence I banish from writing and speech, or you talk about the reason of man being degraded to\nthe level of the brutes, which is a telling argument with the multitude, but not one word of proof or\ndemonstration do you offer. All is probability with you, and yet surely you and Theodorus had better\nreflect whether you are disposed to admit of probability and figures of speech in matters of such\nimportance. He or any other mathematician who argued from probabilities and likelihoods in geometry,\nwould not be worth an ace.\nTheaet. But neither you nor we, Socrates, would be satisfied with such arguments.\nSoc. Then you and Theodorus mean to say that we must look at the matter in some other way?\n3 Theaetetus 29 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTheaet. Yes, in quite another way.\nSoc. And the way will be to ask whether perception is or is not the same as knowledge; for this was the\nreal point of our argument, and with a view to this we raised (did we not?) those many strange questions.\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. Shall we say that we know every thing which we see and hear? for example, shall we say that not\nhaving learned, we do not hear the language of foreigners when they speak to us? or shall we say that we\nnot only hear, but know what they are saying? Or again, if we see letters which we do not understand,\nshall we say that we do not see them? or shall we aver that, seeing them, we must know them?\nTheaet. We shall say, Socrates, that we know what we actually see and hear of them-that is to say, we\nsee and know the figure and colour of the letters, and we hear and know the elevation or depression of\nthe sound of them; but we do not perceive by sight and hearing, or know, that which grammarians and\ninterpreters teach about them.\nSoc. Capital, Theaetetus; and about this there shall be no dispute, because I want you to grow; but there\nis another difficulty coming, which you will also have to repulse.\nTheaet. What is it?\nSoc. Some one will say, Can a man who has ever known anything, and still has and preserves a memory\nof that which he knows, not know that which he remembers at the time when he remembers? I have, I\nfear, a tedious way of putting a simple question, which is only, whether a man who has learned, and\nremembers, can fail to know?\nTheaet. Impossible, Socrates; the supposition is monstrous.\nSoc. Am I talking nonsense, then? Think: is not seeing perceiving, and is not sight perception?\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. And if our recent definition holds, every man knows that which he has seen?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. And you would admit that there is such a thing as memory?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. And is memory of something or of nothing?\nTheaet. Of something, surely.\n3 Theaetetus 30 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nSoc. Of things learned and perceived, that is?\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. Often a man remembers that which he has seen?\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. And if he closed his eyes, would he forget?\nTheaet. Who, Socrates, would dare to say so?\nSoc. But we must say so, if the previous argument is to be maintained.\nTheaet. What do you mean? I am not quite sure that I understand you, though I have a strong suspicion\nthat you are right.\nSoc. As thus: he who sees knows, as we say, that which he sees; for perception and sight and knowledge\nare admitted to be the same.\nTheaet. Certainly.\nSoc. But he who saw, and has knowledge of that which he saw, remembers, when he closes his eyes,\nthat which he no longer sees.\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. And seeing is knowing, and therefore not-seeing is not-knowing?\nTheaet. Very true.\nSoc. Then the inference is, that a man may have attained the knowledge, of something, which he may\nremember and yet not know, because he does not see; and this has been affirmed by us to be a\nmonstrous supposition.\nTheaet. Most true.\nSoc. Thus, then, the assertion that knowledge and perception are one, involves a manifest impossibility?\nTheaet. Yes.\nSoc. Then they must be distinguished?\nTheaet. I suppose that they must.\nSoc. Once more we shall have to begin, and ask \"What is knowledge?\" and yet, Theaetetus, what are we\n3 Theaetetus 31 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\ngoing to do?\nTheaet. About what?\nSoc. Like a good-for-nothing cock, without having won the victory, we walk away from the argument\nand crow.\nTheaet. How do you mean?\nSoc. After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied with mere verbal consistency, and were well\npleased if in this way we could gain an advantage. Although professing not to be mere Eristics, but\nphilosophers, I suspect that we have unconsciously fallen into the error of that ingenious class of\npersons.\nTheaet. I do not as yet understand you.\nSoc. Then I will try to explain myself: just now we asked the question, whether a man who had learned\nand remembered could fail to know, and we showed that a person who had seen might remember when\nhe had his eyes shut and could not see, and then he would at the same time remember and not know. But\nthis was an impossibility. And so the Protagorean fable came to nought, and yours also, who maintained\nthat knowledge is the same as perception.\nTheaet. True.\nSoc. And yet, my friend, I rather suspect that the result would have been different if Protagoras, who\nwas the father of the first of the two-brats, had been alive; he would have had a great deal to say on their\nbehalf. But he is dead, and we insult over his orphan child; and even the guardians whom he left, and of\nwhom our friend Theodorus is one, are unwilling to give any help, and therefore I suppose that must\ntake up his cause myself, and see justice done?\nTheod. Not I, Socrates, but rather Callias, the son of Hipponicus, is guardian of his orphans. I was too\nsoon diverted from the abstractions of dialectic to geometry. Nevertheless, I shall be grateful to you if\nyou assist him.\nSoc. Very good, Theodorus; you shall see how I will come to the rescue. If a person does not attend to\nthe meaning of terms as they are commonly used in argument, he may be involved even in greater\nparadoxes than these. Shall I explain this matter to you or to Theaetetus?\nTheod. To both of us, and let the younger answer; he will incur less disgrace if he is discomfited.\nSoc. Then now let me ask the awful question, which is this:-Can a man know and also not know that\nwhich he knows?\nTheod. How shall we answer, Theaetetus?\n3 Theaetetus 32 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n4\nThe Republic, Book VII: The Allegory of the Cave\nThe Allegory of the Cave1\n(The following discussion takes place between Socrates and Glaucon)\nAnd now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened: --Behold!\nhuman beings living in a underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all\nalong the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that\nthey cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their\nheads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there\nis a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which\nmarionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets.\nI see.\nAnd do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, and statues and figures\nof animals made of wood and stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them\nare talking, others silent.\nYou have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.\nLike ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one another, which the\nfire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?\nTrue, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their\nheads?\nAnd of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?\nYes, he said.\nAnd if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what\nwas actually before them?\nVery true.\nAnd suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side, would they not be sure\nto fancy when one of the passers-by spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing\nshadow?\nNo question, he replied.\n1 Plato, 360 BCE, translated by Benjamin Jowett, 1910\n4 The Republic, Book VII: The Allegory of the Cave 33 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nTo them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images.\nThat is certain.\nAnd now look again, and see what will naturally follow it' the prisoners are released and disabused of\ntheir error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck\nround and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he\nwill be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then\nconceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is\napproaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, -\nwhat will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they\npass and requiring him to name them, -will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows\nwhich he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?\nFar truer.\nAnd if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make\nhim turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to\nbe in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?\nTrue, he now\nAnd suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent, and held fast until\nhe 's forced into the presence of the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he\napproaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are\nnow called realities.\nNot all in a moment, he said.\nHe will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world. And first he will see the shadows\nbest, next the reflections of men and other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he\nwill gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; and he will see the sky and\nthe stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day?\nCertainly.\nLast of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of him in the water, but he will see him in\nhis own proper place, and not in another; and he will contemplate him as he is.\nCertainly.\nHe will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years, and is the guardian of\nall that is in the visible world, and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have\nbeen accustomed to behold?\nClearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.\nAnd when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den and his fellow-prisoners, do\nyou not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change, and pity them?\nCertainly, he would.\nAnd if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to\n4 The Republic, Book VII: The Allegory of the Cave 34 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nobserve the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before, and which followed after, and\nwhich were together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future, do you think\nthat he would care for such honours and glories, or envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with\nHomer,\nBetter to be the poor servant of a poor master, and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and\nlive after their manner?\nYes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in\nthis miserable manner.\nImagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old\nsituation; would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness?\nTo be sure, he said.\nAnd if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had\nnever moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and\nthe time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable) would he\nnot be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it\nwas better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the\nlight, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him to death.\nNo question, he said.\nThis entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the previous argument; the prison-\nhouse is the world of sight, the light of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you\ninterpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my\npoor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether\ntrue or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is\nseen only with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful\nand right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason\nand truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally, either in\npublic or private life must have his eye fixed.\nI agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.\nMoreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to\ndescend to human affairs; for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to\ndwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.\nYes, very natural.\nAnd is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man,\nmisbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become\naccustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places,\nabout the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of\nthose who have never yet seen absolute justice?\nAnything but surprising, he replied.\n4 The Republic, Book VII: The Allegory of the Cave 35 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nAny one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and\narise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of\nthe mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one\nwhose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of\nman has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having\nturned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his\ncondition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which\ncomes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him\nwho returns from above out of the light into the den.\nThat, he said, is a very just distinction.\nBut then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a\nknowledge into the soul which was not there before, like sight into blind eyes.\nThey undoubtedly say this, he replied.\nWhereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already; and that\njust as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument\nof knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into\nthat of being, and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or\nin other words, of the good.\nVery true.\nAnd must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner; not\nimplanting the faculty of sight, for that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is\nlooking away from the truth?\nYes, he said, such an art may be presumed.\nAnd whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities, for even when\nthey are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more than\nanything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by this conversion is rendered useful\nand profitable; or, on the other hand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow intelligence\nflashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue --how eager he is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way\nto his end; he is the reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of evil, and he is\nmischievous in proportion to his cleverness.\nVery true, he said.\nBut what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their youth; and they had been\nsevered from those sensual pleasures, such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were\nattached to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the\nthings that are below --if, I say, they had been released from these impediments and turned in the\nopposite direction, the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what\ntheir eyes are turned to now.\nVery likely.\nYes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely. or rather a necessary inference from what has\npreceded, that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end\n4 The Republic, Book VII: The Allegory of the Cave 36 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nof their education, will be able ministers of State; not the former, because they have no single aim of\nduty which is the rule of all their actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will not\nact at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the\nblest.\nVery true, he replied.\nThen, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will be to compel the best minds to\nattain that knowledge which we have already shown to be the greatest of all-they must continue to\nascend until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow\nthem to do as they do now.\nWhat do you mean?\nI mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed; they must be made to descend\nagain among the prisoners in the den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth\nhaving or not.\nBut is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life, when they might have a better?\nYou have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the legislator, who did not aim at making\nany one class in the State happy above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held\nthe citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the State, and therefore\nbenefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his\ninstruments in binding up the State.\nTrue, he said, I had forgotten.\nObserve, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and\nprovidence of others; we shall explain to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to\nshare in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their own sweet will, and the\ngovernment would rather not have them. Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any\ngratitude for a culture which they have never received. But we have brought you into the world to be\nrulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other citizens, and have educated you far better and\nmore perfectly than they have been educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty.\nWherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general underground abode, and get\nthe habit of seeing in the dark. When you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better\nthan the inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images are, and what they represent,\nbecause you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth. And thus our State which is also\nyours will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other\nStates, in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for\npower, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are\nmost reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in which they are\nmost eager, the worst.\nQuite true, he replied.\nAnd will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at the toils of State, when they are\nallowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light?\n4 The Republic, Book VII: The Allegory of the Cave 37 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nImpossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which we impose upon them are just;\nthere can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the\nfashion of our present rulers of State.\nYes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for your future rulers another and a\nbetter life than that of a ruler, and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which\noffers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are\nthe true blessings of life. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering\nafter the' own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good, order there can\nnever be; for they will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be\nthe ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.\nMost true, he replied.\nAnd the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy. Do you\nknow of any other?\nIndeed, I do not, he said.\nAnd those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they are, there will be rival lovers, and\nthey will fight.\n4 The Republic, Book VII: The Allegory of the Cave 38 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n5\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations: Doubt\nMeditations1\nMEDITATION I.\nOF THE THINGS OF WHICH WE MAY DOUBT.\n1. SEVERAL years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my\nyouth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was\nhighly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to\nrid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the\nfoundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the sciences. But as this\nenterprise appeared to me to be one of great magnitude, I waited until I had attained an age so mature as\nto leave me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should be better able to execute my design.\nOn this account, I have delayed so long that I should henceforth consider I was doing wrong were I still\nto consume in deliberation any of the time that now remains for action. To-day, then, since I have\nopportunely freed my mind from all cares [and am happily disturbed by no passions], and since I am in\nthe secure possession of leisure in a peaceable retirement, I will at length apply myself earnestly and\nfreely to the general overthrow of all my former opinions.\n2. But, to this end, it will not be necessary for me to show that the whole of these are false--a point,\nperhaps, which I shall never reach; but as even now my reason convinces me that I ought not the less\ncarefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is\nmanifestly false, it will be sufficient to justify the rejection of the whole if I shall find in each some\nground for doubt. Nor for this purpose will it be necessary even to deal with each belief individually,\nwhich would be truly an endless labor; but, as the removal from below of the foundation necessarily\ninvolves the downfall of the whole edifice, I will at once approach the criticism of the principles on\nwhich all my former beliefs rested.\n3. All that I have, up to this moment, accepted as possessed of the highest truth and certainty, I received\neither from or through the senses. I observed, however, that these sometimes misled us; and it is the part\nof prudence not to place absolute confidence in that by which we have even once been deceived.\n4. But it may be said, perhaps, that, although the senses occasionally mislead us respecting minute\nobjects, and such as are so far removed from us as to be beyond the reach of close observation, there are\nyet many other of their informations (presentations), of the truth of which it is manifestly impossible to\ndoubt; as for example, that I am in this place, seated by the fire, clothed in a winter dressing gown, that I\nhold in my hands this piece of paper, with other intimations of the same nature. But how could I deny\n1 Rene\u00e9 Descartes, 1641, Translated by John Veitch\n5 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Doubt 39 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nthat I possess these hands and this body, and withal escape being classed with persons in a state of\ninsanity, whose brains are so disordered and clouded by dark bilious vapors as to cause them\npertinaciously to assert that they are monarchs when they are in the greatest poverty; or clothed [in gold]\nand purple when destitute of any covering; or that their head is made of clay, their body of glass, or that\nthey are gourds? I should certainly be not less insane than they, were I to regulate my procedure\naccording to examples so extravagant.\n5. Though this be true, I must nevertheless here consider that I am a man, and that, consequently, I am in\nthe habit of sleeping, and representing to myself in dreams those same things, or even sometimes others\nless probable, which the insane think are presented to them in their waking moments. How often have I\ndreamt that I was in these familiar circumstances, that I was dressed, and occupied this place by the fire,\nwhen I was lying undressed in bed? At the present moment, however, I certainly look upon this paper\nwith eyes wide awake; the head which I now move is not asleep; I extend this hand consciously and with\nexpress purpose, and I perceive it; the occurrences in sleep are not so distinct as all this. But I cannot\nforget that, at other times I have been deceived in sleep by similar illusions; and, attentively considering\nthose cases, I perceive so clearly that there exist no certain marks by which the state of waking can ever\nbe distinguished from sleep, that I feel greatly astonished; and in amazement I almost persuade myself\nthat I am now dreaming.\n6. Let us suppose, then, that we are dreaming, and that all these particulars--namely, the opening of the\neyes, the motion of the head, the forth- putting of the hands--are merely illusions; and even that we\nreally possess neither an entire body nor hands such as we see. Nevertheless it must be admitted at least\nthat the objects which appear to us in sleep are, as it were, painted representations which could not have\nbeen formed unless in the likeness of realities; and, therefore, that those general objects, at all events,\nnamely, eyes, a head, hands, and an entire body, are not simply imaginary, but really existent. For, in\ntruth, painters themselves, even when they study to represent sirens and satyrs by forms the most\nfantastic and extraordinary, cannot bestow upon them natures absolutely new, but can only make a\ncertain medley of the members of different animals; or if they chance to imagine something so novel\nthat nothing at all similar has ever been seen before, and such as is, therefore, purely fictitious and\nabsolutely false, it is at least certain that the colors of which this is composed are real. And on the same\nprinciple, although these general objects, viz. [a body], eyes, a head, hands, and the like, be imaginary,\nwe are nevertheless absolutely necessitated to admit the reality at least of some other objects still more\nsimple and universal than these, of which, just as of certain real colors, all those images of things,\nwhether true and real, or false and fantastic, that are found in our consciousness (cogitatio),are formed.\n7. To this class of objects seem to belong corporeal nature in general and its extension; the figure of\nextended things, their quantity or magnitude, and their number, as also the place in, and the time during,\nwhich they exist, and other things of the same sort.\n8. We will not, therefore, perhaps reason illegitimately if we conclude from this that Physics,\nAstronomy, Medicine, and all the other sciences that have for their end the consideration of composite\nobjects, are indeed of a doubtful character; but that Arithmetic, Geometry, and the other sciences of the\nsame class, which regard merely the simplest and most general objects, and scarcely inquire whether or\nnot these are really existent, contain somewhat that is certain and indubitable: for whether I am awake or\ndreaming, it remains true that two and three make five, and that a square has but four sides; nor does it\nseem possible that truths so apparent can ever fall under a suspicion of falsity [or incertitude].\n5 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Doubt 40 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n9. Nevertheless, the belief that there is a God who is all powerful, and who created me, such as I am,\nhas, for a long time, obtained steady possession of my mind. How, then, do I know that he has not\narranged that there should be neither earth, nor sky, nor any extended thing, nor figure, nor magnitude,\nnor place, providing at the same time, however, for [the rise in me of the perceptions of all these objects,\nand] the persuasion that these do not exist otherwise than as I perceive them ? And further, as I\nsometimes think that others are in error respecting matters of which they believe themselves to possess a\nperfect knowledge, how do I know that I am not also deceived each time I add together two and three, or\nnumber the sides of a square, or form some judgment still more simple, if more simple indeed can be\nimagined? But perhaps Deity has not been willing that I should be thus deceived, for he is said to be\nsupremely good. If, however, it were repugnant to the goodness of Deity to have created me subject to\nconstant deception, it would seem likewise to be contrary to his goodness to allow me to be occasionally\ndeceived; and yet it is clear that this is permitted.\n10. Some, indeed, might perhaps be found who would be disposed rather to deny the existence of a\nBeing so powerful than to believe that there is nothing certain. But let us for the present refrain from\nopposing this opinion, and grant that all which is here said of a Deity is fabulous: nevertheless, in\nwhatever way it be supposed that I reach the state in which I exist, whether by fate, or chance, or by an\nendless series of antecedents and consequents, or by any other means, it is clear (since to be deceived\nand to err is a certain defect ) that the probability of my being so imperfect as to be the constant victim\nof deception, will be increased exactly in proportion as the power possessed by the cause, to which they\nassign my origin, is lessened. To these reasonings I have assuredly nothing to reply, but am constrained\nat last to avow that there is nothing of all that I formerly believed to be true of which it is impossible to\ndoubt, and that not through thoughtlessness or levity, but from cogent and maturely considered reasons;\nso that henceforward, if I desire to discover anything certain, I ought not the less carefully to refrain\nfrom assenting to those same opinions than to what might be shown to be manifestly false.\n11. But it is not sufficient to have made these observations; care must be taken likewise to keep them in\nremembrance. For those old and customary opinions perpetually recur-- long and familiar usage giving\nthem the right of occupying my mind, even almost against my will, and subduing my belief; nor will I\nlose the habit of deferring to them and confiding in them so long as I shall consider them to be what in\ntruth they are, viz, opinions to some extent doubtful, as I have already shown, but still highly probable,\nand such as it is much more reasonable to believe than deny. It is for this reason I am persuaded that I\nshall not be doing wrong, if, taking an opposite judgment of deliberate design, I become my own\ndeceiver, by supposing, for a time, that all those opinions are entirely false and imaginary, until at\nlength, having thus balanced my old by my new prejudices, my judgment shall no longer be turned aside\nby perverted usage from the path that may conduct to the perception of truth. For I am assured that,\nmeanwhile, there will arise neither peril nor error from this course, and that I cannot for the present yield\ntoo much to distrust, since the end I now seek is not action but knowledge.\n12. I will suppose, then, not that Deity, who is sovereignly good and the fountain of truth, but that some\nmalignant demon, who is at once exceedingly potent and deceitful, has employed all his artifice to\ndeceive me; I will suppose that the sky, the air, the earth, colors, figures, sounds, and all external things,\nare nothing better than the illusions of dreams, by means of which this being has laid snares for my\ncredulity; I will consider myself as without hands, eyes, flesh, blood, or any of the senses, and as falsely\nbelieving that I am possessed of these; I will continue resolutely fixed in this belief, and if indeed by this\nmeans it be not in my power to arrive at the knowledge of truth, I shall at least do what is in my power,\n5 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Doubt 41 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nviz, [ suspend my judgment ], and guard with settled purpose against giving my assent to what is false,\nand being imposed upon by this deceiver, whatever be his power and artifice. But this undertaking is\narduous, and a certain indolence insensibly leads me back to my ordinary course of life; and just as the\ncaptive, who, perchance, was enjoying in his dreams an imaginary liberty, when he begins to suspect\nthat it is but a vision, dreads awakening, and conspires with the agreeable illusions that the deception\nmay be prolonged; so I, of my own accord, fall back into the train of my former beliefs, and fear to\narouse myself from my slumber, lest the time of laborious wakefulness that would succeed this quiet\nrest, in place of bringing any light of day, should prove inadequate to dispel the darkness that will arise\nfrom the difficulties that have now been raised.\nMEDITATION II.\nOF THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN MIND; AND THAT IT IS MORE EASILY KNOWN THAN\nTHE BODY.\n1. The Meditation of yesterday has filled my mind with so many doubts, that it is no longer in my power\nto forget them. Nor do I see, meanwhile, any principle on which they can be resolved; and, just as if I\nhad fallen all of a sudden into very deep water, I am so greatly disconcerted as to be unable either to\nplant my feet firmly on the bottom or sustain myself by swimming on the surface. I will, nevertheless,\nmake an effort, and try anew the same path on which I had entered yesterday, that is, proceed by casting\naside all that admits of the slightest doubt, not less than if I had discovered it to be absolutely false; and I\nwill continue always in this track until I shall find something that is certain, or at least, if I can do\nnothing more, until I shall know with certainty that there is nothing certain. Archimedes, that he might\ntransport the entire globe from the place it occupied to another, demanded only a point that was firm and\nimmovable; so, also, I shall be entitled to entertain the highest expectations, if I am fortunate enough to\ndiscover only one thing that is certain and indubitable.[\n2. I suppose, accordingly, that all the things which I see are false (fictitious); I believe that none of those\nobjects which my fallacious memory represents ever existed; I suppose that I possess no senses; I\nbelieve that body, figure, extension, motion, and place are merely fictions of my mind. What is there,\nthen, that can be esteemed true ? Perhaps this only, that there is absolutely nothing certain.\n3. But how do I know that there is not something different altogether from the objects I have now\nenumerated, of which it is impossible to entertain the slightest doubt? Is there not a God, or some being,\nby whatever name I may designate him, who causes these thoughts to arise in my mind ? But why\nsuppose such a being, for it may be I myself am capable of producing them? Am I, then, at least not\nsomething? But I before denied that I possessed senses or a body; I hesitate, however, for what follows\nfrom that? Am I so dependent on the body and the senses that without these I cannot exist? But I had the\npersuasion that there was absolutely nothing in the world, that there was no sky and no earth, neither\nminds nor bodies; was I not, therefore, at the same time, persuaded that I did not exist? Far from it; I\nassuredly existed, since I was persuaded. But there is I know not what being, who is possessed at once of\nthe highest power and the deepest cunning, who is constantly employing all his ingenuity in deceiving\nme. Doubtless, then, I exist, since I am deceived; and, let him deceive me as he may, he can never bring\nit about that I am nothing, so long as I shall be conscious that I am something. So that it must, in fine, be\nmaintained, all things being maturely and carefully considered, that this proposition (pronunciatum ) I\nam, I exist, is necessarily true each time it is expressed by me, or conceived in my mind.\n5 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Doubt 42 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n6\nHume\u2019s \u201cAn Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding\u201d: Skepticism\nAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding1\nSECTION XII\nOF THE ACADEMICAL OR SCEPTICAL PHILOSOPHY\nPART I\nTHERE is not a greater number of philosophical reasonings, displayed upon any subject, than those,\nwhich prove the existence of a Deity, and refute the fallacies of Atheists; and yet the most religious\nphilosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist. How shall we\nreconcile these contradictions? The knights errant, who wandered about to clear the world of dragons\nand giants, never entertained the least doubt with regard to the existence of these monsters.\nThe Sceptic is another enemy of religion, who naturally provokes the indignation of all divines and\ngraver philosophers; though it is certain, that no man ever met with any such absurd creature, or\nconversed with a man, who had no opinion or principle concerning any subject, either of action or\nspeculation. This begets a very natural question; What is meant by a sceptic? And how far it is possible\nto push these philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty?\nThere is a species of scepticism, antecedent to all study and philosophy, which is much inculcated by\nDes Cartes and others, as a sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgement. It\nrecommends an universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and principles, but also of our very\nfaculties; of whose veracity, say they, we must assure ourselves, by a chain of reasoning, deduced from\nsome original principle, which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful. But neither is there any such\noriginal principle, which has a prerogative above others, that are self-evident and convincing: or if there\nwere, could we advance a step beyond it, but by the use of those very faculties, of which we are\nsupposed to be already diffident. The Cartesian doubt, therefore, were it ever possible to be attained by\nany human creature (as it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable; and no reasoning could ever bring\nus to a state of assurance and conviction upon any subject.\nIt must, however, be confessed, that this species of scepticism, when more moderate, may be understood\nin a very reasonable sense, and is a necessary preparative to the study of philosophy, by preserving a\nproper impartiality in our judgements, and weaning our mind from all those prejudices, which we may\nhave imbibed from education or rash opinion. To begin with clear and self-evident principles, to\nadvance by timorous and sure steps, to review frequently our conclusions, and examine accurately all\ntheir consequences; though by these means we shall make both a slow and a short progress in our\n1 David Hume, 1748\n6 Hume\u2019s \u201cAn Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\u201d: Skepticism 43 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nsystems; are the only methods, by which we can ever hope to reach truth, and attain a proper stability\nand certainty in our determinations.\nThere is another species of scepticism, consequent to science and enquiry, when men are supposed to\nhave discovered, either the absolute fallaciousness of their mental faculties, or their unfitness to reach\nany fixed determination in all those curious subjects of speculation, about which they are commonly\nemployed. Even our very senses are brought into dispute, by a certain species of philosophers; and the\nmaxims of common life are subjected to the same doubt as the most profound principles or conclusions\nof metaphysics and theology. As these paradoxical tenets (if they may be called tenets) are to be met\nwith in some philosophers, and the refutation of them in several, they naturally excite our curiosity, and\nmake us enquire into the arguments, on which they may be founded.\nI need not insist upon the more trite topics, employed by the sceptics in all ages, against the evidence of\nsense; such as those which are derived from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs, on\nnumberless occasions; the crooked appearance of an oar in water; the various aspects of objects,\naccording to their different distances; the double images which arise from the pressing one eye; with\nmany other appearances of a like nature. These sceptical topics, indeed, are only sufficient to prove, that\nthe senses alone are not implicitly to be depended on; but that we must correct their evidence by reason,\nand by considerations, derived from the nature of the medium, the distance of the object, and the\ndisposition of the organ, in order to render them, within their sphere, the proper criteria of truth and\nfalsehood. There are other more profound arguments against the senses, which admit not of so easy a\nsolution.\nIt seems evident, that men are carried, by a natural instinct or prepossession, to repose faith in their\nsenses; and that, without any reasoning, or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an\nexternal universe, which depends not on our perception, but would exist, though we and every sensible\ncreature were absent or annihilated. Even the animal creation are governed by a like opinion, and\npreserve this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts, designs, and actions.\nIt seems also evident, that, when men follow this blind and powerful instinct of nature, they always\nsuppose the very images, presented by the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any\nsuspicion, that the one are nothing but representations of the other. This very table, which we see white,\nand which we feel hard, is believed to exist, independent of our perception, and to be something external\nto our mind, which perceives it. Our presence bestows not being on it: our absence does not annihilate it.\nIt preserves its existence uniform and entire, independent of the situation of intelligent beings, who\nperceive or contemplate it.\nBut this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy, which\nteaches us, that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses\nare only the inlets, through which these images are conveyed, without being able to produce any\nimmediate intercourse between the mind and the object. The table, which we see, seems to diminish, as\nwe remove farther from it: but the real table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration: it\nwas, therefore, nothing but its image, which was present to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of\nreason; and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that the existences, which we consider, when we say,\nthis house and that tree, are nothing but perceptions in the mind, and fleeting copies or representations of\nother existences, which remain uniform and independent.\n6 Hume\u2019s \u201cAn Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\u201d: Skepticism 44 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nSo far, then, are we necessitated by reasoning to contradict or depart from the primary instincts of\nnature, and to embrace a new system with regard to the evidence of our senses. But here philosophy\nfinds herself extremely embarrassed, when she would justify this new system, and obviate the cavils and\nobjections of the sceptics. She can no longer plead the infallible and irresistible instinct of nature: for\nthat led us to a quite different system, which is acknowledged fallible and even erroneous. And to justify\nthis pretended philosophical system, by a chain of clear and convincing argument, or even any\nappearance of argument, exceeds the power of all human capacity.\nBy what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind must be caused by external objects,\nentirely different from them, though resembling them (if that be possible) and could not arise either from\nthe energy of the mind itself, or from the suggestion of some invisible and unknown spirit, or from some\nother cause still more unknown to us? It is acknowledged, that, in fact, many of these perceptions arise\nnot from anything external, as in dreams, madness, and other diseases. And nothing can be more\ninexplicable than the manner, in which body should so operate upon mind as ever to convey an image of\nitself to a substance, supposed of so different, and even contrary a nature.\nIt is a question of fact, whether the perceptions of the senses be produced by external objects,\nresembling them: how shall this question be determined? By experience surely; as all other questions of\na like nature. But here experience is, and must be entirely silent. The mind has never anything present to\nit but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any experience of their connexion with objects. The\nsupposition of such a connexion is, therefore, without any foundation in reasoning.\nTo have recourse to the veracity of the supreme Being, in order to prove the veracity of our senses, is\nsurely making a very unexpected circuit. If his veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our senses\nwould be entirely infallible; because it is not possible that he can ever deceive. Not to mention, that, if\nthe external world be once called in question, we shall be at a loss to find arguments, by which we may\nprove the existence of that Being or any of his attributes.\nThis is a topic, therefore, in which the profounder and more philosophical sceptics will always triumph,\nwhen they endeavour to introduce an universal doubt into all subjects of human knowledge and enquiry.\nDo you follow the instincts and propensities of nature, may they say, in assenting to the veracity of\nsense? But these lead you to believe that the very perception or sensible image is the external object. Do\nyou disclaim this principle, in order to embrace a more rational opinion, that the perceptions are only\nrepresentations of something external? You here depart from your natural propensities and more obvious\nsentiments; and yet are not able to satisfy your reason, which can never find any convincing argument\nfrom experience to prove, that the perceptions are connected with any external objects.\nThere is another sceptical topic of a like nature, derived from the most profound philosophy; which\nmight merit our attention, were it requisite to dive so deep, in order to discover arguments and\nreasonings, which can so little serve to any serious purpose. It is universally allowed by modern\nenquirers, that all the sensible qualities of objects, such as hard, soft, hot, cold, white, black, &c. are\nmerely secondary, and exist not in the objects themselves, but are perceptions of the mind, without any\nexternal archetype or model, which they represent. If this be allowed, with regard to secondary qualities,\nit must also follow, with regard to the supposed primary qualities of extension and solidity; nor can the\nlatter be any more entitled to that denomination than the former. The idea of extension is entirely\nacquired from the senses of sight and feeling; and if all the qualities, perceived by the senses, be in the\n6 Hume\u2019s \u201cAn Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\u201d: Skepticism 45 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nmind, not in the object, the same conclusion must reach the idea of extension, which is wholly\ndependent on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secondary qualities. Nothing can save us from this\nconclusion, but the asserting, that the ideas of those primary qualities are attained by Abstraction, an\nopinion, which, if we examine it accurately, we shall find to be unintelligible, and even absurd. An\nextension, that is neither tangible nor visible, cannot possibly be conceived: and a tangible or visible\nextension, which is neither hard nor soft, black nor white, is equally beyond the reach of human\nconception. Let any man try to conceive a triangle in general, which is neither Isosceles nor Scalenum,\nnor has any particular length or proportion of sides; and he will soon perceive the absurdity of all the\nscholastic notions with regard to abstraction and general ideas.\nThus the first philosophical objection to the evidence of sense or to the opinion of external existence\nconsists in this, that such an opinion, if rested on natural instinct, is contrary to reason, and if referred to\nreason, is contrary to natural instinct, and at the same time carries no rational evidence with it, to\nconvince an impartial enquirer. The second objection goes farther, and represents this opinion as\ncontrary to reason: at least, if it be a principle of reason, that all sensible qualities are in the mind, not in\nthe object. Bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities, both primary and secondary, you in a manner\nannihilate it, and leave only a certain unknown, inexplicable something, as the cause of our perceptions;\na notion so imperfect, that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it.\n6 Hume\u2019s \u201cAn Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\u201d: Skepticism 46 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nUNIT TWO: PERSONAL IDENTITY AND THE MIND-\nBODY PROBLEM1\nIn philosophy, the matter of personal identity deals with such questions as, \"What makes it true that a\nperson at one time is the same thing as a person at another time?\" or \"What kinds of things are we\npersons?\" The term \"identity\" in \"personal identity\" refers to \"numerical identity,\" where saying that X\nand Y are numerically identical just means that X and Y are the same thing. Personal identity is not the\nsame as personality, though some theories of personal identity maintain that continuity of personality\nmay be required for one to persist through time. In relation to answer questions about persistence, such\nas under what conditions a person does or does not continue to exist, contemporary philosophers often\nseek to first answer questions about what sort of things we are, most fundamentally. Many people claim\nwe are animals, or organisms, but many others strongly believe that no person can exist without mental\ntraits, such as consciousness. Since an organism can exist without consciousness, both these views\ncannot be true (if we are organisms we can exist without being conscious; but if we can't exist without\nconsciousness, we are not organisms). Thus, in order to determine whether certain features (such as\nconsciousness) are crucial to a person's continued existence, it may be important to first ask what sort of\nthings we are.\nGenerally, personal identity is the unique numerical identity of a person in the course of time. That is,\nthe necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time\ncan be said to be the same person, persisting through time;\nIn contemporary metaphysics, the matter of personal identity is referred to as the diachronic problem of\npersonal identity. The synchronic problem concerns the question of: What features and traits\ncharacterize a person at a given time. In Continental philosophy and in Analytic philosophy, enquiry to\nthe nature of Identity is common. Continental philosophy deals with conceptually maintaining identity\nwhen confronted by different philosophic propositions, postulates, and presuppositions about the world\nand its nature.\n1 This section is reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

Plutarch\nasked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same\nship.\nThe paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato prior to\nPlutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known,\nincluding the grandfather's axe, which has had both head and handle replaced.\nVariations of the paradox\nAncient philosophy\nThis particular version of the paradox was first introduced in Greek legend as reported by the historian,\nbiographer, and essayist Plutarch,\n\u201cThe ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was\npreserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old\nplanks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship\nbecame a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one\nside holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.\u201d\n\u2014 Plutarch, Theseus\nPlutarch thus questions whether the ship would remain the same if it were entirely replaced, piece by\npiece. Centuries later, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes introduced a further puzzle, wondering what\nwould happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a\nsecond ship. Hobbes asked which ship, if either, would be the original Ship of Theseus.\nModern era\nJohn Locke proposed a scenario regarding a favorite sock that develops a hole. He pondered whether the\nsock would still be the same after a patch was applied to the hole, and if it would be the same sock after\na second patch was applied, and a third, etc., until all of the material of the original sock has been\nreplaced with patches.\n1 This section is reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

In some Spanish-speaking\ncountries, Jeannot's knife is present as a proverb, though referred to simply as \"the family knife\". The\nprinciple, however, remains the same.\nA Hungarian version of the story features \"Lajos Kossuth's pocket knife\", having its blade and handle\ncontinuously replaced but still being referred to as the very knife of the famous statesman. As a\nproverbial expression it is used for objects or solutions being repeatedly renewed and gradually replaced\nto an extent that it has no original parts.\nA comedic version of the story appears in the popular TV sitcom Only Fools and Horses, in which the\ncharacter Trigger explains that his broom... \"has had 17 new heads and 14 new handles in it's time\".\nOne version is often discussed in introductory Jurisprudence and Evidence classes in law school,\ndiscussing whether a weapon used in a murder, for example, would still be considered the \"murder\nweapon\" if both its handle and head/blade were to be replaced at separate, subsequent times. (Perhaps\nyes if the issue is whether tracing the history of 'its' possession may lead one back to the murderer;\nperhaps no if the issue is whether fingerprints from the murder may still be on 'it'. This shows how a\nphilosophical paradox can be resolved, perhaps in different ways in different contexts, when converted\ninto a question about the physical world. Likewise mathematical paradoxes in physics, for example the\nsignificance of whether or not a number is rational in Hofstadter's butterfly.)\nIn popular culture\nThe paradox appears in various forms in fictional contexts, particularly in fantasy or science-fiction, for\nexample where a character has body parts swapped for artificial replacements until the person has been\nentirely replaced. There are many other variations with reference to the same concept in popular culture\nfor example axes and brooms.\nProposed resolutions\nHeraclitus\nThe Greek philosopher Heraclitus attempted to solve the paradox by introducing the idea of a river\nwhere water replenishes it. Arius Didymus quoted him as saying \"upon those who step into the same\nrivers, different and again different waters flow\". Plutarch disputed Heraclitus' claim about stepping\ntwice into the same river, citing that it cannot be done because \"it scatters and again comes together, and\napproaches and recedes\".\n7 The Ship of Theseus 49 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nAristotle's causes\nAccording to the philosophical system of Aristotle and his followers, four causes or reasons describe a\nthing; these causes can be analyzed to get to a solution to the paradox. The formal cause or 'form'\n(perhaps best parsed as the cause of an object's form or of its having that form) is the design of a thing,\nwhile the material cause is the matter of which the thing is made. Another of Aristotle's causes is the\n'end' or final cause, which is the intended purpose of a thing. The ship of Theseus would have the same\nends, those being, mythically, transporting Theseus, and politically, convincing the Athenians that\nTheseus was once a living person, though its material cause would change with time. The efficient cause\nis how and by whom a thing is made, for example, how artisans fabricate and assemble something; in\nthe case of the ship of Theseus, the workers who built the ship in the first place could have used the\nsame tools and techniques to replace the planks in the ship.\nAccording to Aristotle, the \"what-it-is\" of a thing is its formal cause, so the ship of Theseus is the 'same'\nship, because the formal cause, or design, does not change, even though the matter used to construct it\nmay vary with time. In the same manner, for Heraclitus's paradox, a river has the same formal cause,\nalthough the material cause (the particular water in it) changes with time, and likewise for the person\nwho steps in the river.\nThis argument's validity and soundness as applied to the paradox depend on the accuracy not only of\nAristotle's expressed premise that an object's formal cause is not only the primary or even sole\ndeterminer of its defining characteristic(s) or essence (\"what-it-is\") but also of the unstated, stronger\npremise that an object's formal cause is the sole determiner of its identity or \"which-it-is\" (i.e., whether\nthe previous and the later ships or rivers are the \"same\" ship or river). This latter premise is subject to\nattack by indirect proof using arguments such as \"Suppose two ships are built using the same design and\nexist at the same time until one sinks the other in battle. Clearly the two ships are not the same ship even\nbefore, let alone after, one sinks the other, and yet the two have the same formal cause; therefore, formal\ncause cannot by itself suffice to determine an object's identity\" or \" [...] therefore, two objects' or object-\ninstances' having the same formal cause does not by itself suffice to make them the same object or prove\nthat they are the same object.\"\nDefinitions of \"the same\"\nOne common argument found in the philosophical literature is that in the case of Heraclitus' river one is\ntripped up by two different definitions of \"the same\". In one sense, things can be \"qualitatively\nidentical\", by sharing some properties. In another sense, they might be \"numerically identical\" by being\n\"one\". As an example, consider two different marbles that look identical. They would be qualitatively,\nbut not numerically, identical. A marble can be numerically identical only to itself.\nNote that some languages differentiate between these two forms of identity. In German, for example,\n\"gleich\" (\"equal\") and \"selbe\" (\"self-same\") are the pertinent terms, respectively. At least in formal\nspeech, the former refers to qualitative identity (e.g. die gleiche Murmel, \"the same [qualitative]\nmarble\") and the latter to numerical identity (e.g. die selbe Murmel, \"the same [numerical] marble\").\nColloquially, \"gleich\" is also used in place of \"selbe\", however.\n7 The Ship of Theseus 50 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nFour-dimensionalism\nTed Sider and others have proposed that considering objects to extend across time as four-dimensional\ncausal series of three-dimensional \"time-slices\" could solve the ship of Theseus problem because, in\ntaking such an approach, each time-slice and all four dimensional objects remain numerically identical\nto themselves while allowing individual time-slices to differ from each other. The aforementioned river,\ntherefore, comprises different three-dimensional time-slices of itself while remaining numerically\nidentical to itself across time; one can never step into the same river-time-slice twice, but one can step\ninto the same (four-dimensional) river twice.\nIn Japan\nIn Japan, Shinto shrines are rebuilt every twenty years with entirely \"new wood\". The continuity over\nthe centuries is spiritual and comes from the source of the wood in the case of the Ise Jingu's Naiku\nshrine, which is harvested from an adjoining forest that is considered sacred. The shrine has currently\nbeen rebuilt 62 times.\n7 The Ship of Theseus 51 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n8\nThis Above All1\nIt had been almost exactly fifty years since the first successful human head transplant. The first\nattempted one was in 2017, and while there were some organic signs of life in the head for 6 days, the\nperson never appeared to wake up or become conscious. For both moral and medical reasons, another\none wasn\u2019t attempted until 2023, and this time it went much better. The resultant head actually did\nregain some minor control of the hands and arms and lived for approximately two years until the\ncomplications from unforeseen autoimmune issues ultimately led to the rapid deterioration of the body,\nhead and all. But that success ushered in a new era, and brain-only transplants gradually became\nperfected and not uncommon. With the success of the transplant process came unprecedented\nunderstanding of the physics of the brain, but the connection between our minds and consciousness\nremained mysterious. There had been attempts to transfer brains into traditional electronic computers,\nbut even while there had been some success transferring sets of memories to computer storage devices,\nno person had ever been truly \u201cdownloaded\u201d into a computer. If such a thing were possible, then a\ndeteriorating brain would no longer be an impediment to life; it would just be another disease with a\nregular course of treatment. While a computer transfer seemed too complex to be accomplished in the\nnear future, Alan had another idea, and he was seeking a volunteer to be his first test subject.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m still not entirely clear on how this will be any different than the failed computer\ndownload attempts of the past. Believe me, I have put much thought into trying those, but I\u2019m not sure I\nwould survive through the whole process,\u201d Greg asked Alan from his hospital bed.\nGreg was the perfect test subject for Alan. He had been involved in a bizarre accident in which\nalmost a third of his brain had been completely destroyed while the rest of it and his body were left\nintact. Most of the time in these cases, the remaining part of the brain \u201cre-programs\u201d itself to assume\nthose functions the missing part of the brain once performed. For unknown reasons, Greg\u2019s brain was\nnot fixing itself, and, in fact, it seemed to be getting worse. If something weren\u2019t done, it appeared his\nbrain would slowly continue to die until it were entirely gone, with his body inevitably soon to follow.\nHe had only some control over the left half of his body remaining, and the atrophy from disuse was on\nthe verge of causing permanent damage to his body. On top of his unique medical condition, Greg had\nalso been childhood friends with Alan, which gave Alan a slight edge in convincing Greg to try the\nprocedure.\n\u201cIn one sense, it\u2019s not much different, you\u2019re right. It might not even work, but without it\u2026well,\nyou\u2019re aware of your fate better than I am,\u201d Alan paused, to ensure he had Greg\u2019s attention. \u201cLook, I can\nunderstand your hesitation. Not only do computer transfers appear to only be capable of capturing a\nsmall portion of our minds, the process itself is unfortunately entirely destructive. You can\u2019t survive any\nmind to computer transfer attempt, and my brain transfer process works the same. Whatever the results\n1 Noah Levin, 2017, printed here under a CC BY-ND license\n8 This Above All 52 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nare of what I am proposing, the brain you have now will be, for lack of a better word, fried. Your brain\nand mind as they are now, in this physical form, will not survive. However, there is one crucial\ndifference in my process: rather than transferring you into traditional computer media, I have \u2013 I believe\n\u2013 successfully recreated the human brain using entirely inorganic materials. Every little part of the brain\nhas been meticulously reconstructed, down to the smallest component of every axon, in complete\nparallel to a healthy human brain. The difference with my process is that I don\u2019t want to, nor need to,\ntranslate anything in your mind into another language, the way a normal brain to computer transfer\nwould work. I merely want to copy and replicate exactly what is in your brain into an inorganic\nrecreation of your brain,\u201d Alan said, speeding up near the end of his monologue as he became\nincreasingly more excited and confident in his work. He continued, \u201cIt will be you when we\u2019re done, I\nhave no doubt about that.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m still not entirely sure about that,\u201d Greg whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t shake the feeling that this\nbrain, with its headaches and problems, will be gone, but I won\u2019t be. Am I now defined by my\ndisabilities? Will I be an entirely different person without these problems? If I go through with this\nprocedure, will that be the same as death?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this before. You said you were persuaded by my presentation of the\nphilosophical views on these problems by John Locke. Is this no longer true? Need I remind you that\nLocke sees no better way of understanding who we are than by identifying our most important aspects\nwith our memories,\u201d Alan reminded him.\n\u201cI know, but I am still worried by these notions. What if my memories are copied? Would there\nthen be two of me? We already know that we can insert fake memories into people and have them\nbelieve they\u2019re real, and that makes me second-guess identifying ourselves with our memories. How do\nwe know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not? Were we really childhood friends or did you just make me believe\nthat?\u201d Greg responded worriedly.\n\u201cI understand your concerns, but we both know that if I could make you falsely believe all the\nmemories we made as children, I\u2019d put my skills to better use than trying to save you. No offense,\u201d he\ncaught himself. \u201cLook, if it\u2019s not your memories, what then defines you? What matters?\u201d\n\u201cWell, what about my personality? All the subtle biochemical interactions in my body help make\nme who I am. All different parts of the body play a role in this, and who is to say that this new brain\nwon\u2019t change me completely? Remember the cases of Eadweard Muybridge and Phineas Gage,\u201d Greg\nreminded him.\nEadweard Muybridge, a pioneer in the arts of photography and moving pictures, had a bad\naccident as a young man which he, and his friends, claimed altered his personality to the extent that he\nwent from a compassionate individual to one that was unpredictable and could suddenly go from calm to\nextremely emotional in an instant. He murdered his wife\u2019s lover and was found innocent, not because his\ninsanity plea convinced the jury, but because they presumably believed he lacked control due to his\nbrain injury. Phineas Gage experienced a similar fate: when a tamper (long medal rod) used in the\nprocess of repairing railroad spikes was shot clean through his head, his personality was said to take the\nsame sort of turn. These cases are ones that helped illustrate a very clear, strong, and subtle connection\nbetween the health of the brains and our personalities. But no one knew just how close the organic\n8 This Above All 53 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nconnection was, for while partial inorganic neural implants had seen moderate success, a full\nreplacement on this scale had never been considered.\n\u201cTrue, we do not know all of the subtleties that make our bodies work. Our body can maintain\nmany regulatory functions even when the rest of the body is gone. Subtle changes in our blood\nchemistry can drastically affect our mood, and the brain and mind itself are still largely a mystery. There\nmight be subtle organic chemicals present in the membranes that we have missed and this could have a\nsnowball effect on your mind in ways we could have never foreseen. All I can tell you is that we have\ndone our best, and I know that someone closely resembling you will emerge from the surgery,\u201d Alan\nsaid to his friend.\n\u201cWe never discussed him but the philosopher Derek Parfit has the most convincing argument for\nme. I read him a long time ago in one of my undergraduate courses, and his basic idea was that we are\nmisguided when we think that our continued existence is what\u2019s important. We obviously care that we\nsurvive, but what this \u2018we\u2019 means is not that \u2018I\u2019 as a unique person survive, but rather that what is\nimportant about me continues on. I am still afraid that it won\u2019t be me that wakes up, but if there is\nsomething at the end of this all that is a lot like me, then that sounds like my best shot for surviving. I\nknow that if I do nothing, everything about me will be gone. At least with your surgery, something about\nme might survive. And, who knows? Maybe you are as brilliant as you think you are and I will wake up\nas if nothing happened,\u201d Greg replied.\n\u201cIf we are successful, you will be changed \u2013 your brain is unlikely to ever age or lose function.\nWe never much discussed the potential \u2018positive\u2019 side effects of success. You may have the most perfect\nbrain to ever exist,\u201d Alan told him.\n\u201cHopefully my mind would be able to catch up to it then. Can I please have some time to think\nthings through? I promise I\u2019ll get back to you by the end of the day,\u201d Greg asked.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Alan said as he got up to leave the room.\nOnly a few hours passed when Alan received the call from Greg. All Greg could get out was that\nhe was ready and to perform the surgery as soon as he possibly could. Alan obliged and Greg and the\noperating room were being prepared for surgery as he arrived at the hospital.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re frightened right now, and I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t, too. I wouldn\u2019t have\ncome to you with this if I didn\u2019t truly believe it would work. I could never live with myself if I killed my\noldest friend,\u201d Alan said to Greg.\n\u201cDo you remember when we were in third grade and I was too afraid to climb up the tree onto\nthe roof with you to watch the fireworks? You convinced me to try to climb up and that the tree was\nperfectly safe and that it was just like climbing a ladder. I believed you, but I fell anyway. I blamed you\nfor months, but it was my own fault. I let my fear get the better of me and lost my grip. You never fell\nfrom that tree, despite my falling every time you convinced me to try again. I always wanted to climb\nlike you, but I could never get over my fear, and my fingers would always stiffen up and I\u2019d lose my\ngrip time and time again. Your hands were amazing then, and they are amazing now. That\u2019s why I feel\nsafe in letting you do this. It was never your fault when I fell from the tree; it was always my decision. If\n8 This Above All 54 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nI fall this time, it was only because you, just like then, were trying to make me into the person I wanted\nto be,\u201d Greg told him softly.\n\u201cI never knew you felt that way,\u201d Alan said, just as emotional.\n\u201cI thought I never needed to say it. If I have any chance of living through what has happened to\nme, you\u2019re my best chance,\u201d Greg replied.\n\u201cThere will be someone that comes out of this that is like you, and I hope you remember this\nconversation,\u201d Alan paused. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked. Greg nodded, and they began to administer the\nsedatives.\n\u201c\u2018This above all\u2026\u2019\u201d Greg trailed off as the drugs took hold.\n\u201c\u2018To thine own self be true,\u2019\u201d Alan finished for him. \u201cIt will be you that awakes, my friend.\u201d\nThe operation took a total of 32 hours. They had decided to remove the brain first and keep it in\nstasis while they implanted the new synthetic brain. After ensuring that all the neural connections were\nworking properly between the new brain and the body\u2019s nervous system, they began the transfer of\nneurological information. That part took only a few minutes, and it had seemed to go as planned. The\nprocedure had been successful in the final round of simulations, but they would not know if it worked in\nreality until it was all done. They brought Greg out of the operating room and began the process of\nbringing him back to consciousness.\nGreg\u2019s eyes slowly opened and adjusted to the light. The path his gaze took around the room did\nnot betray the thoughts going on inside the head. Was the brain working as hoped? Was he aware of\nwhat was going on? At least, the surgery seemed to have been minimally successful and the eyes were\nsearching with a purpose. Someone was thinking inside that head.\nWith some hesitation, Alan finally whispered, \u201cGreg, can you hear me?\u201d\n8 This Above All 55 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n9\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations: Cartesian Dualism\nMeditations1\nMEDITATION VI\nOF THE EXISTENCE OF MATERIAL THINGS, AND OF THE REAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN\nTHE MIND AND BODY OF MAN.\n1. THERE now only remains the inquiry as to whether material things exist. With regard to this\nquestion, I at least know with certainty that such things may exist, in as far as they constitute the object\nof the pure mathematics, since, regarding them in this aspect, I can conceive them clearly and distinctly.\nFor there can be no doubt that God possesses the power of producing all the objects I am able distinctly\nto conceive, and I never considered anything impossible to him, unless when I experienced a\ncontradiction in the attempt to conceive it aright. Further, the faculty of imagination which I possess,\nand of which I am conscious that I make use when I apply myself to the consideration of material things,\nis sufficient to persuade me of their existence: for, when I attentively consider what imagination is, I\nfind that it is simply a certain application of the cognitive faculty ( facultas cognoscitiva) to a body\nwhich is immediately present to it, and which therefore exists.\n2. And to render this quite clear, I remark, in the first place, the difference that subsists between\nimagination and pure intellection [or conception ]. For example, when I imagine a triangle I not only\nconceive (intelligo) that it is a figure comprehended by three lines, but at the same time also I look upon\n(intueor) these three lines as present by the power and internal application of my mind (acie mentis), and\nthis is what I call imagining. But if I desire to think of a chiliogon, I indeed rightly conceive that it is a\nfigure composed of a thousand sides, as easily as I conceive that a triangle is a figure composed of only\nthree sides; but I cannot imagine the thousand sides of a chiliogon as I do the three sides of a triangle,\nnor, so to speak, view them as present [with the eyes of my mind ]. And although, in accordance with\nthe habit I have of always imagining something when I think of corporeal things, it may happen that, in\nconceiving a chiliogon, I confusedly represent some figure to myself, yet it is quite evident that this is\nnot a chiliogon, since it in no wise differs from that which I would represent to myself, if I were to think\nof a myriogon, or any other figure of many sides; nor would this representation be of any use in\ndiscovering and unfolding the properties that constitute the difference between a chiliogon and other\npolygons. But if the question turns on a pentagon, it is quite true that I can conceive its figure, as well as\nthat of a chiliogon, without the aid of imagination; but I can likewise imagine it by applying the\nattention of my mind to its five sides, and at the same time to the area which they contain. Thus I\nobserve that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to\nconceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the\ndifference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura).\n1 Rene\u00e9 Descartes, 1641, Translated by John Veitch\n9 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Cartesian Dualism 56 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n3. I remark, besides, that this power of imagination which I possess, in as far as it differs from the power\nof conceiving, is in no way necessary to my [nature or] essence, that is, to the essence of my mind; for\nalthough I did not possess it, I should still remain the same that I now am, from which it seems we may\nconclude that it depends on something different from the mind. And I easily understand that, if some\nbody exists, with which my mind is so conjoined and united as to be able, as it were, to consider it when\nit chooses, it may thus imagine corporeal objects; so that this mode of thinking differs from pure\nintellection only in this respect, that the mind in conceiving turns in some way upon itself, and considers\nsome one of the ideas it possesses within itself; but in imagining it turns toward the body, and\ncontemplates in it some object conformed to the idea which it either of itself conceived or apprehended\nby sense. I easily understand, I say, that imagination may be thus formed, if it is true that there are\nbodies; and because I find no other obvious mode of explaining it, I thence, with probability, conjecture\nthat they exist, but only with probability; and although I carefully examine all things, nevertheless I do\nnot find that, from the distinct idea of corporeal nature I have in my imagination, I can necessarily infer\nthe existence of any body.\n4. But I am accustomed to imagine many other objects besides that corporeal nature which is the object\nof the pure mathematics, as, for example, colors, sounds, tastes, pain, and the like, although with less\ndistinctness; and, inasmuch as I perceive these objects much better by the senses, through the medium of\nwhich and of memory, they seem to have reached the imagination, I believe that, in order the more\nadvantageously to examine them, it is proper I should at the same time examine what sense-perception\nis, and inquire whether from those ideas that are apprehended by this mode of thinking ( consciousness),\nI cannot obtain a certain proof of the existence of corporeal objects.\n5. And, in the first place, I will recall to my mind the things I have hitherto held as true, because\nperceived by the senses, and the foundations upon which my belief in their truth rested; I will, in the\nsecond place, examine the reasons that afterward constrained me to doubt of them; and, finally, I will\nconsider what of them I ought now to believe.\n6. Firstly, then, I perceived that I had a head, hands, feet and other members composing that body which\nI considered as part, or perhaps even as the whole, of myself. I perceived further, that that body was\nplaced among many others, by which it was capable of being affected in diverse ways, both beneficial\nand hurtful; and what was beneficial I remarked by a certain sensation of pleasure, and what was hurtful\nby a sensation of pain. And besides this pleasure and pain, I was likewise conscious of hunger, thirst,\nand other appetites, as well as certain corporeal inclinations toward joy, sadness, anger, and similar\npassions. And, out of myself, besides the extension, figure, and motions of bodies, I likewise perceived\nin them hardness, heat, and the other tactile qualities, and, in addition, light, colors, odors, tastes, and\nsounds, the variety of which gave me the means of distinguishing the sky, the earth, the sea, and\ngenerally all the other bodies, from one another. And certainly, considering the ideas of all these\nqualities, which were presented to my mind, and which alone I properly and immediately perceived, it\nwas not without reason that I thought I perceived certain objects wholly different from my thought,\nnamely, bodies from which those ideas proceeded; for I was conscious that the ideas were presented to\nme without my consent being required, so that I could not perceive any object, however desirous I might\nbe, unless it were present to the organ of sense; and it was wholly out of my power not to perceive it\nwhen it was thus present. And because the ideas I perceived by the senses were much more lively and\nclear, and even, in their own way, more distinct than any of those I could of myself frame by meditation,\nor which I found impressed on my memory, it seemed that they could not have proceeded from myself,\n9 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Cartesian Dualism 57 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nand must therefore have been caused in me by some other objects; and as of those objects I had no\nknowledge beyond what the ideas themselves gave me, nothing was so likely to occur to my mind as the\nsupposition that the objects were similar to the ideas which they caused. And because I recollected also\nthat I had formerly trusted to the senses, rather than to reason, and that the ideas which I myself formed\nwere not so clear as those I perceived by sense, and that they were even for the most part composed of\nparts of the latter, I was readily persuaded that I had no idea in my intellect which had not formerly\npassed through the senses. Nor was I altogether wrong in likewise believing that that body which, by a\nspecial right, I called my own, pertained to me more properly and strictly than any of the others; for in\ntruth, I could never be separated from it as from other bodies; I felt in it and on account of it all my\nappetites and affections, and in fine I was affected in its parts by pain and the titillation of pleasure, and\nnot in the parts of the other bodies that were separated from it. But when I inquired into the reason why,\nfrom this I know not what sensation of pain, sadness of mind should follow, and why from the sensation\nof pleasure, joy should arise, or why this indescribable twitching of the stomach, which I call hunger,\nshould put me in mind of taking food, and the parchedness of the throat of drink, and so in other cases, I\nwas unable to give any explanation, unless that I was so taught by nature; for there is assuredly no\naffinity, at least none that I am able to comprehend, between this irritation of the stomach and the desire\nof food, any more than between the perception of an object that causes pain and the consciousness of\nsadness which springs from the perception. And in the same way it seemed to me that all the other\njudgments I had formed regarding the objects of sense, were dictates of nature; because I remarked that\nthose judgments were formed in me, before I had leisure to weigh and consider the reasons that might\nconstrain me to form them.\n7. But, afterward, a wide experience by degrees sapped the faith I had reposed in my senses; for I\nfrequently observed that towers, which at a distance seemed round, appeared square, when more closely\nviewed, and that colossal figures, raised on the summits of these towers, looked like small statues, when\nviewed from the bottom of them; and, in other instances without number, I also discovered error in\njudgments founded on the external senses; and not only in those founded on the external, but even in\nthose that rested on the internal senses; for is there aught more internal than pain ? And yet I have\nsometimes been informed by parties whose arm or leg had been amputated, that they still occasionally\nseemed to feel pain in that part of the body which they had lost, --a circumstance that led me to think\nthat I could not be quite certain even that any one of my members was affected when I felt pain in it.\nAnd to these grounds of doubt I shortly afterward also added two others of very wide generality: the first\nof them was that I believed I never perceived anything when awake which I could not occasionally think\nI also perceived when asleep, and as I do not believe that the ideas I seem to perceive in my sleep\nproceed from objects external to me, I did not any more observe any ground for believing this of such as\nI seem to perceive when awake; the second was that since I was as yet ignorant of the author of my\nbeing or at least supposed myself to be so, I saw nothing to prevent my having been so constituted by\nnature as that I should be deceived even in matters that appeared to me to possess the greatest truth.\nAnd, with respect to the grounds on which I had before been persuaded of the existence of sensible\nobjects, I had no great difficulty in finding suitable answers to them; for as nature seemed to incline me\nto many things from which reason made me averse, I thought that I ought not to confide much in its\nteachings. And although the perceptions of the senses were not dependent on my will, I did not think\nthat I ought on that ground to conclude that they proceeded from things different from myself, since\nperhaps there might be found in me some faculty, though hitherto unknown to me, which produced\nthem.\n9 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Cartesian Dualism 58 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n8. But now that I begin to know myself better, and to discover more clearly the author of my being, I do\nnot, indeed, think that I ought rashly to admit all which the senses seem to teach, nor, on the other hand,\nis it my conviction that I ought to doubt in general of their teachings.\n9. And, firstly, because I know that all which I clearly and distinctly conceive can be produced by God\nexactly as I conceive it, it is sufficient that I am able clearly and distinctly to conceive one thing apart\nfrom another, in order to be certain that the one is different from the other, seeing they may at least be\nmade to exist separately, by the omnipotence of God; and it matters not by what power this separation is\nmade, in order to be compelled to judge them different; and, therefore, merely because I know with\ncertitude that I exist, and because, in the meantime, I do not observe that aught necessarily belongs to\nmy nature or essence beyond my being a thinking thing, I rightly conclude that my essence consists only\nin my being a thinking thing [or a substance whose whole essence or nature is merely thinking]. And\nalthough I may, or rather, as I will shortly say, although I certainly do possess a body with which I am\nvery closely conjoined; nevertheless, because, on the one hand, I have a clear and distinct idea of\nmyself, in as far as I am only a thinking and unextended thing, and as, on the other hand, I possess a\ndistinct idea of body, in as far as it is only an extended and unthinking thing, it is certain that I, [that is,\nmy mind, by which I am what I am], is entirely and truly distinct from my body, and may exist without\nit.\n9 Descartes\u2019 Meditations: Cartesian Dualism 59 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n10\nHoops of Steel1\nNorthwest Regional Hospital was chosen by doctors Renee Carter and David Hughes for the\nexperiment precisely because it was unexceptional. It was a quiet place where no extraordinary\nprocedures were performed and patients came to die very ordinary deaths. It also happened to be where\nthey first met doing their residencies, so it meant they were familiar with its procedures and generally\nwell-liked. While it had the guise of a public hospital, it was primarily funded by a local businessman\nthat owned many large manufacturing facilities in the area. The nearest hospital used to be 3 hours away\nand, with the potential for serious accidents every day for his workers, he felt opening the hospital was\njust a necessary part of doing business. He was also a Lutheran minister, and all these factors meant it\nwould be easier to accomplish what began as a conversation over a beer many years ago.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received approval from the review board to proceed with the experiment! Of the fifteen\npatients we received consent from earlier, nine are still alive and eight of them are still consenting to our\nexperiment,\u201d Renee shouted excitedly as she entered the office she shared with David. He was both too\nnervous and abrasive to attend the meeting with Renee. They were happy the hospital gave them some\nprivate space to set up their things a few days ago in anticipation of receiving approval for the\nexperiment. After all, no patients were going to be harmed by their work, as they were all dying, but the\npotential implications of their research were not to be taken lightly. Whatever their results showed, there\nwere bound to be serious consequences for some people's deeply held beliefs about the world.\n\u201cThat\u2019s great! But you really must prepare yourself for finding out the truth that you\u2019re wrong,\u201d\nDavid replied with a sly grin. He always enjoyed pestering her about what he called her \u201cgroundless\nmystical beliefs.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on. You know that all this experiment can do is confirm my beliefs and will do\nnothing to undo them. If it turns out I\u2019m \u2018wrong\u2019 and souls don\u2019t actually weigh anything, then I\u2019m fine.\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t be wrong even if we find out you\u2019re \u2018right\u2019 since I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll find. I\u2019m just\ngenuinely curious to learn something new,\u201d she responded.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. But if it turns out souls don\u2019t have any measurable weight, then there\nwould really be no way to ever scientifically prove their existence, unless they exist in the form of a yet-\nto-be-discovered brand new energy state,\u201d David reminded her. He continued, \u201cAfter all, you are the\nnamesake of a guy that thought we could never touch or interact with souls directly, but that they would\ncontrol us by communicating through our cerebellum or something. I still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re named\nafter Descartes.\u201d\n1 Noah Levin, 2017, printed here under a CC BY-ND license\n10 Hoops of Steel 60 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n\u201cWhat can I say? My parents are good Catholics and appreciate one of the greatest minds of all\ntime. It was the pineal gland, not the cerebellum \u2013 that would just be crazy. But how can you hold that\nagainst him? He barely had any knowledge of medicine and was just trying to explain how it is our\nminds and souls can interact with our physical bodies. I still can\u2019t believe you refuse to read his\nmeditations. They really are a great piece of literature and philosophy, and they\u2019re not really that long.\nYou\u2019d understand where I\u2019m coming from if you had ever bothered to look at them. Maybe I\u2019ll just post\nthem along with pictures of cute kittens on Facebook? That seems to get my less academically-minded\nfriends to read things. Perhaps I can run an experiment to see if that works on you, too?\u201d Renee bantered\nback as she began to take stock of the equipment in the room.\n\u201cSpeaking of good experiments, Dr. Duncan McDougall, your almighty savior, was a terrible\nscientist. He\u2019s the only reason people believe souls actually weigh an amount we can measure, but his\nmethods were not up to even the scientific standards of the time in the early 20th century. He made his\nobservations of the weight of the soul under very terrible experimental circumstances with only a few\nobservations and somehow settled on a little less than an ounce, 21 grams, as the weight of the soul. He\nwas unable to accurately reproduce his measurements or experiments. At least that theory resulted in a\ngood performance for Benicio del Toro in the movie 21 Grams,\u201d David said.\n\u201cAnd if he or someone else had experimented further on his hypothesis that a dying person loses\nsome precise amount of weight after death because the soul is lost, then we wouldn\u2019t be about to make\nhistory, would we? I still can\u2019t believe that no one has properly conducted an experiment to confirm or\nrefute the claim that the soul leaves the body after death and there is a measurable loss of mass,\u201d Renee\nsaid, shaking her head while smiling at the same time. \u201cWe are just so lucky we get to be the ones to test\nit.\u201d\n\u201cNow that, I agree with. I think it\u2019s all a load of garbage, but it is a very interesting load of\ngarbage worth investigating, if at least to help illustrate that there is definitely no physical evidence in\nfavor of the soul\u2019s existence. There is still, of course, one major problem: when exactly will we declare\nsomeone dead?\u201d David asked. He had made a very important point here, and Renee knew it, as there\nwere quite varying definitions and criteria for death. \u201cAre we allowed to look at the loss of mass after\nthe death of the physical body in patients that are already brain dead? Or are we to assume their souls are\nalready gone?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed this, and we are only going to use patients that are going to expire\nfrom cardiopulmonary cessation, and observe them before, during, and after their hearts and lungs cease\nto function. It doesn\u2019t matter for how long they\u2019ve been stopped, since all we care about is what happens\nto their weight in the minutes after they do stop,\u201d Renee reminded him.\n\u201cBut when they die still has to be important and we should still have a good grasp of when they\nare dead as we currently understand death. For how long must their hearts and lungs stop? It will be hard\nto pick a point that is not arbitrary, because \u2013 as we both know \u2013 you can keep a patient\u2019s heart beating\nand lungs going for quite a while using artificial means, and they can even be restored to normal\nfunctions using devices like defibrillators, especially if they just lost their vital functions. Do we declare\nthem dead immediately, even though they may spontaneously come back? Do we do it after a minute?\nAfter two minutes? Five minutes? All of those are currently in use as standards,\u201d David asked.\n10 Hoops of Steel 61 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, we still haven\u2019t decided that factor yet, partly since we never thought we\u2019d get\napproval so easily or so early. But, again, it doesn\u2019t matter when we declare them dead for our little\nexperiment, and if we get the results I\u2019m hoping for, then maybe we will have a new way to determine\ndeath. It\u2019s like this: if the soul does have a measurable weight, then when we measure it leaving the\nbody, shouldn\u2019t we declare the body dead then? And if the \u2018dead\u2019 body does come back to life and\nregains the weight it just lost, wouldn\u2019t that then even more confirm the theory of the soul and its\nresidence in the body?\u201d Renee asked excitedly.\n\u201cThat would be interesting, and you\u2019re right. However, just be prepared for us to see nothing\nwhen someone dies by any standard we choose to apply,\u201d David said sternly.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but remember something I read in college by the Philosopher John Perry. In his\nstory, a philosopher is dying and her friends are trying to comfort her. She says there is no point in doing\nso since she knows she will shortly end up as nothing much more than worm food since she believes she\nhas no soul and is simply identical to just her body. When her body goes, everything goes, and she sees\nno possible way for her to continue on after her body dies. Her friends however, think otherwise, and try\nto convince her that she can survive the death of her body. I guess I\u2019m still wondering that even if we\nfind a mysterious loss of weight after death, what will that tell us? We can\u2019t quite directly assume that\nit\u2019s the loss of a soul that caused it, but we know that\u2019s what everyone would say. But then what is the\nsoul? Is it just weight? Does it even matter if we have one or not? What if someone loses that weight,\ngets revived, and the soul doesn\u2019t return? No offense, but I\u2019ve always thought that\u2019s what might have\nhappened to you,\u201d Renee said, attempting to lighten the mood.\n\u201cDogs have always looked at me like I have no soul, and my parents swear I stopped breathing\nfor a full three minutes when I was two years old and deathly ill from pneumonia, so that would make\nsense. You\u2019re actually making some sense today, since I also agree with you about the results of our\nexperiment. It would seem that someone could lose their soul and still be the same person possibly,\nright? If someone loses 21 grams, but comes \u2018back to life\u2019 and acts no differently than before, why say\nthey're a different person? The soul wouldn\u2019t add anything to us understanding the identity of a person,\nand the soul would then have to be carved off of our understanding of identity using the precision of\nOckam's Razor,\u201d David said while pretending to excise a mole from his arm with a scalpel.\n\u201cThat's the idea that the simplest explanation is the correct one, right?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly, and that idea wouldn't be worthy of such a cool name. Old William of Ockham was\nan Anglican Bishop that told us that we should not multiply causes beyond necessity, which is very\ndifferent than heading straight towards the simplest explanation. That idea has obvious flaws in it, and is\ntotally not what he meant. Your soul example is exactly what he had in mind: if us having a soul adds\nnothing to our understanding of identities and how our persons work \u2013 and there is no independent\nevidence to say we have them \u2013 then they provide no explanatory force in our discussion and ought to be\nremoved as useless, hideous moles before they turn cancerous and infect our understanding of the truth,\u201d\nDavid said, once again pretending to cut off his mole.\n\u201cThank you for that history and philosophy lesson, professor. Though I believe we have souls, I\nnever thought it was the soul itself that really made us who we are, but rather it is because the soul\ncontains our memories, and our memories make us who we are. John Locke gave me that idea. I know\n10 Hoops of Steel 62 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nthat you equate the physical body to our identity and our physical brain to our minds, which isn't that far\noff from Locke. You just think that if I made a copy of your memories, it wouldn't be you, but some\nbizarre unholy copy. I truly believe a copy of your mind would be just as annoying and brilliant as the\noriginal,\u201d she said with an air of finality.\n\u201cThat may be, but why would that copy then be me? Many people have the same memories of\nwatching the Cubs finally win the World Series in 2016, but they\u2019re clearly different people. There has\ngot to be something else that makes someone the same and it can\u2019t just be memories. What if we do find\na soul and we can copy it? What would that say about our identities?\u201d David replied.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s just crazy. Let\u2019s stop discussing this and start setting up our experiments. Our\nremaining nine patients are literally on their death beads and we need to set up our \u2018soul containment\nchambers,\u2019 awesome name, by the way, and calibrate the equipment in their rooms before they expire.\nWe\u2019ve gone over it so many times, I know we have it right. We\u2019ll be able to properly measure the\nprecise weight of everything in the body just before it dies and properly account for all losses of gas and\nmoisture up to, during, and after the moment of death. Unless souls get trapped by sterile instruments,\nany loss of weight will be very interesting,\u201d Renee responded as she began placing their equipment onto\na cart.\n\u201cRegardless of what results we get, they will be helpful and interesting. You ready to be known\nas one half of the duo that \u2018proves souls do not exist\u2019?\u201d David asked as he also began to load the carts.\n\u201cI really hope that\u2019s not what they say, but we know everyone loves a sensational headline, like\n\u2018Young, bright doctor proves the soul weighs 21 grams! How come no one ever bothered to do this\nbefore?\u2019 or \u2018Philosophers now have an easier job, thanks to attractive doctor and her sidekick\u2019 or\nsomething like that,\u201d Renee said smugly.\n\u201cIf we do find a soul, how will we catch it?\u201d David asked, somewhat nervously.\n\u201cWith \u2018hoops of steel,\u2019\u201d Renee replied dreamily.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d David was genuinely confused.\n\u201c\u2019Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel.\u2019\nIt is Polonius\u2019 advice to his son Laertes in Hamlet. For some reason it\u2019s a line that\u2019s always stuck with\nme, and I can\u2019t help but think of it when I wonder how exactly we can catch a soul if we ever find one. It\nis the advice that made me stick with you all these years, so don\u2019t dismiss it so quickly,\u201d Renee smiled\nas she said this.\nJust then, they received a call letting them know that one of their patients had begun to decline\nand they should set up their equipment immediately before it was too late. They were about to get their\nfirst bit of information on the weight of souls, and they could hardly contain their excitement.\n10 Hoops of Steel 63 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n11\nThe Devil Himself1\nThe alarm woke them all from their slumber. First, Derek had awakened from his nap. He was on\nwatch, but as the group had come accustomed to the complete lack of problems overnight, being \u201con\nwatch\u201d meant sleeping on the bed that had been set up in the communications chamber, precisely for\nthose \u201con watch.\u201d The alarm going off wasn\u2019t abnormal, and the others only awoke because Derek\nincreased the volume and shouted at them over the intercom. \u201cGuys, this is serious! Everyone get in here\nnow!\u201d\nThe rest of the small crew, Virginia, David, and Jean, joined Derek. They knew something was\nwrong since there was the faint odor of smoke in the air. The filtration system would only miss smoke\nparticles to this degree if it were overwhelmed.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Jean shouted as she entered the room. Although all members of the\ncrew were on equal standing, she had assumed the role of leader. It had become easy to live together in\nsuch tight quarters with one person assuming the function of final arbiter on any disagreements, and\nJean was reasonable enough that it worked for the group.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s bad! Really bad! I have no idea how our sensors missed this and why it was able to\nbreach our shell! I think it hit the intake grill on the south wall, which would explain the filtration\nsystem\u2019s failure,\u201d Derek cried.\nThey all took a look at the cameras and diagnostics on the screen. It quickly became clear what\nhad happened: a small storm had suddenly kicked up within the outer protective shell and quickly\ndeveloped a micro-cyclone that shot a small stone straight through the protective grating where fresh air\nwas brought in, filtered, and separated to help replenish the recycled air in the base as needed. This was\nMars, after all, and the weather was always unpredictable.\n\u201cThe stone must have penetrated very deeply and somehow struck an oxygen storage tank,\ngenerating a spark. Why aren\u2019t the fire suppressors working?\u201d Virginia asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think it matters right now. We need to get out of here immediately. Do\nyou see how quickly the safety walls are failing? It\u2019s not long until the fire spreads to us here.\u201d As David\nsaid this, a loud explosion rocked the room, and the camera trained on the vehicle hangar went blank.\n\u201cGamma base is too far away to make it here in time to save us. There\u2019s no way that fire takes\nmore than 30 minutes to get to the door here, and the smoke is likely to take over the ventilation ducts\nbefore that anyway. Wait \u2013 can we close the vents off? Isolate ourselves? At least that will give us a\n1 Noah Levin, 2017, printed here under a CC BY-ND license\n11 The Devil Himself 64 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nchance to figure things out. We should have 45 minutes of oxygen in here, and the fire doors should last\ndouble that, though it won\u2019t matter at that point,\u201d Virginia said.\n\u201cThe vents are already closed,\u201d Jean said as she finished moving some manual levers near the\ndoor. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\nThey all looked at each other confused. Jean was not only the natural leader here, she also knew\nthis base inside and out. They were all trapped in this room and no one knew how to get out. They had\none option, the keyhole, but it only mattered if any of them remembered about it. It had been placed in\nthe storage room so long ago that Jean had never even seen it. It was only through having to go through\na complete accounting of all supplies on a monthly basis that she knew where it was and what it was, but\nhad never given it a second thought. It had never even been tested.\n\u201cWhat about the keyhole?\u201d Derek asked timidly. They all showed a glimpse of hope and fear at\nthe same time.\nThe keyhole was part of a teleporter prototype that had been deposited at the base when it was\nfirst built, partly for a situation like this one. The working model for a teleporter only required\nsignificant power and equipment on one end, thus making it easy to drop a smaller receiving portal\nanywhere in the universe. The technology and development rather interestingly seemed to have it right\non these smaller receptacles, referred to as \u201ckeyholes\u201d not just because it meshes well with calling the\nlarger halves \u201cgates,\u201d but because structurally they resembled an old-fashioned keyhole. All of the\nproblems in development were related to the gate, and the keyholes hadn\u2019t changed in years. While the\nkeyhole here was an earlier prototype, it was physically and functionally identical to the newer ones\nbeing made. It had not, however, had its self-diagnostic tests run in a long time and never actually used\nto transport matter, let alone living, organic matter. The first successful tests involving living animals\nhad just occurred, and the process was nowhere near perfect. This keyhole, for now, was to be used only\nin case of emergency, and that time had come.\n\u201cRemember how the transporters in Star Trek worked? These ones work almost precisely like\nthem. Matter enters into one end, gets transformed into energy, and then put back into matter on the\nother end. You just get converted, but in an odd way, you stay intact,\u201d David said, hurriedly. Until\narriving at the station, he had made transporter technology his intellectual hobby. \u201cWith how successful\nthe recent tests have been, there\u2019s a good chance it will be safe and we\u2019ll come out the other side. We\nknow what our fate is if we stay here, so I\u2019m going to use it.\u201d\nHe ran into the storage room and carried out the keyhole. As he started to set it up, he asked Jean\nto contact the International Moon Research Base and ask for Dr. Okeda, the leading researcher on the\norganic matter transport experiments. David powered up the keyhole and it all looked good.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if I use this thing, so you all must go before me. I know how these things work, and\nthey are death. I won\u2019t be coming out the other side; it will just be some odd copy of me. I\u2019m fine with\nmy fate here, and I can accept my fate since the outcome will be the same no matter what happens,\u201d Jean\nsaid as they waited for acknowledgment from Dr. Okeda.\n11 The Devil Himself 65 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n\u201cBut that\u2019s crazy! You just get transformed into another state for an instant, and you don\u2019t even\nnotice or feel it. The same energy stored in your body right now is what makes you up on the other side.\nYou must come if you can,\u201d Derek pleaded.\n\u201cLook, I know you all don\u2019t agree with my faith, but I believe my body and soul \u2013 yes, I still\nbelieve in those \u2013 were given to me by God and that even if I made it through the transporter process,\nmy body will have gone through a state that changed so much, it can\u2019t be me that comes out the other\nside. I don\u2019t believe my soul would come with my either, but it doesn\u2019t matter. My body is sacred to me\nas it is, and the transporter would destroy that sacredness. You all know this, this isn\u2019t the first time\nwe\u2019ve ever talked about the potential of transporters. I said I wouldn\u2019t use one myself even if my life\ndepended on it, and I meant it. I\u2019ll stay here and ensure everything works for you all,\u201d Jean said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending the gate information over right now,\u201d Dr. Okeda interrupted as he appeared on\nthe screen. It looked as if he had just been awakened, which was very likely as the moon was also on\n\u201cspace time\u201d that aligned with Greenwich Mean Time on Earth, and it was the middle of the night for\nhim as well.\n\u201cI see it. I\u2019ll enter it into the transporter right now,\u201d David replied.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not ready for this, and it may not even work. I\u2019m uncomfortable attempting this, but\nsomeone above me has ordered this to be tried out of desperation. We have been having storage battery\nissues here at our base and are operating at only 30% of our normal power supply. We have just enough\nenergy to spare to transport all four of you, but if something goes wrong, we won\u2019t be able to give it\nanother try. I won\u2019t jeopardize the safety of this station to run this emergency experiment,\u201d Dr. Okeda\nsaid sharply.\n\u201cUnderstood, of course. This is our only hope, and I have faith in your research, Dr. Okeda. I\nhave been following your work for years,\u201d David said excitedly, despite the direness of the situation.\nThe fire was progressing faster than they had anticipated, and David hurried to ready the transporter.\n\u201cThere is no time for inorganic testing, doctor. I\u2019ll go through first on your go. Are you ready?\u201d\nDavid asked through the screen, finally showing his nervousness.\n\u201cWe are clear. Proceed when ready,\u201d Dr. Okeda replied.\nDavid pressed some buttons on the keyhole and nothing seemed to change, except the screen\nindicating it was ready. All one had to do was enter the keyhole shaped alcove, which was\napproximately 6 feet high, 2 feet wide at the bottom, 3 feet wide at the top, and about 3 feet deep. It was\nopen on both ends, and there was one button on the inside that matched one on the outside labeled with a\nbright, green glowing \u201cGO.\u201d Without saying a word, David walked into the keyhole, turned around,\nsmiled, and pressed the button. He was gone in an instant and all eyes darted for the screen broadcasting\nthe gate on the moon.\n\u201cWoohoo! That was amazing! I didn\u2019t feel a thing!\u201d David shouted as he instantly appeared in\nthe gate. It appeared to have worked, and everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief. Their relief was\nshort-lived when the video feed went blank.\n11 The Devil Himself 66 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n\u201cWait, what happened?\u201d Derek asked. There appeared to be no signal coming from the moon,\nthough all other sensors seemed to suggest nothing else had changed. After a few seconds, the video\nfeed restarted.\n\u201cWe had a small glitch \u2013 the drain on our power was more than anticipated. Transporting a\nwhole person takes more energy than we had calculated. We only have enough for 2 more rounds of\ntransportation, so two of you will have to go together,\u201d Dr. Okeda said as he reappeared on the screen.\nAs the fire consumed the pure oxygen contained in storage tanks throughout the base, it burned stronger.\nTime was running out.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go next,\u201d Virginia stated. \u201cWhether or not this works again is irrelevant \u2013 it\u2019s our only\noption. As long as something comes out the other side, it\u2019s the best shot at any part of me surviving. If it\nall goes well again, we\u2019ll know in a few moments. If not\u2026well, you all know how I feel,\u201d Virginia\nfinished, choking back some tears. She stepped through the keyhole, disappeared, and in a few instants,\nshe appeared right where she was, in the keyhole on Mars.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Derek shouted at Dr. Okeda.\n\u201cWe lost the signal somehow. Is she OK?\u201d Dr. Okeda asked.\n\u201cYes, I don\u2019t feel any different,\u201d Virginia replied. \u201cLet\u2019s do it again. Ready?\u201d\n\u201cThere was minimal power loss, so we\u2019re good to go again. Ready when you are,\u201d Dr. Okeda\nstated.\nJust like last time, she pushed a button and disappeared. In an instant, she appeared in the gate\nand collapsed. After a collective gasp, she stood up and waved at the camera, teary-eyed.\n\u201cWe have just enough energy for one last transport with the two of you. Things should have\nstabilized now, so you should go when ready,\u201d Dr. Okeda said.\n\u201cWait. I need to ensure we have the backup of our research. We shouldn\u2019t lose everything we\nhave now, especially the current data on what the hell is happening to our base,\u201d Jean said as she began\ntyping hurriedly on the computer. \u201cThis will only take a few seconds.\u201d\nAs she worked, Derek took in everything that had happened, and then began thinking out loud.\n\u201cRemember all the episodes of Star Trek where things went wrong with the transporter? Since\nwe\u2019re simply stored in energy, there can be a gap between being digitized and being re-created, like with\nwhat happened to Virginia, and she luckily reappeared here. This means there is even the possibility of\nduplication. There was that one episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Commander Riker\nwas accidentally duplicated in a transporter accident. The episode was called \u2018Second Chances\u2019 because\nfor the one that remained stuck on a planet, it was like 8 years literally flew by without anyone knowing\nhe existed, so he got to pick up where he left off while the other one that it made it off the planet had\ncontinued to live. There was also that one time Scotty was caught in a beam for a long time and then\n11 The Devil Himself 67 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\ncame out of it. What if this happens to us?\u201d Derek said, mostly to himself.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only enough energy for one more transport, and even that is questionable. We shouldn\u2019t\npush it \u2013 only one of us should go at a time, and hope there\u2019s enough left for the other. You must go\nfirst, and I\u2019ll follow if you\u2019re fine. I know that I won\u2019t come out the other side regardless of what you\nthink. Now, hurry! There\u2019s not much time!\u201d Jean ordered.\n\u201cYou have to come. But we would still have you, even if you don't think it's you. That's got to be\nworth something,\u201d he pleaded.\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m dead either way. If I got through and it works, that won\u2019t be me. I\u2019ll stay behind\n\u2013 my fate has already been sealed,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave you back here. You have to come with me. There\u2019s only just enough energy for\none more transport \u2013 we must go through together. It\u2019s the only way,\u201d Derek pleaded again.\n\u201cStop wasting the time you have left to go!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere without you. I can\u2019t bear to live knowing you got left behind instead of\nme. We must go together right now.\u201d\nJean thought for a second, took a deep breath, and said, \u201cFine. If it\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll go,\nwe\u2019ll do it together,\u201d she said as she kissed him on the cheek and calmly grabbed his hand. As they\nwalked toward the keyhole, she shoved Derek into it, alone, and pushed the button. She then looked at\nthe communications screen and said, just before it went blank, \u201c\u2018'Tis too much proved, that with\ndevotion\u2019s visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The devil himself.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d David asked.\n\u201cIt means she\u2019s not coming,\u201d Virginia replied. \u201cYou know how much Jean adored Shakespeare.\nIt\u2019s a quote from Hamlet when Polonius is convincing his daughter to deceive Hamlet in order to try and\nsave him,\u201d she continued through tears.\nThough Derek had entered the keyhole, he did not appear through the gate. The fire had\nconsumed the communications room only seconds after Derek entered the keyhole. It wasn\u2019t clear what\nwas happening, but he had definitely been energized. While the scientists were trying to figure out what\nhappened, Derek appeared in the gate in what felt like an instant to him.\n\u201cIt worked! Wait, Jean still needs to come through!\u201d Derek shouted as they shut down the gate\nbehind him. \u201cWhat are you doing? There\u2019s still time!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s over,\u201d Virginia said, in a state of shock. \u201cIt took almost two hours for you to come\nthrough, and Jean never made it into the keyhole. You made it out of there just in time.\u201d\n\u201cDid I? What happened in those two hours? Where was I?...what was I?\u201d\n11 The Devil Himself 68 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know. There were complications \u2013 you know something like this has never been\nattempted before,\u201d David said from the corner, sitting in a daze staring at the gate.\nJust then, the gate shook and trembled again. Someone else was coming through. Derek was\nwaiting with shocked anticipation, hoping to see Jean come through. No one was prepared for what\nhappened next.\n11 The Devil Himself 69 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n12\nRemoving \u201cidentity\u201d from \u201cpersons\u201d: Derek Parfit\nReasons and Persons1\nReasons and Persons is a philosophical work by Derek Parfit, first published in 1984. It focuses on\nethics, rationality and personal identity. His views on personal identity transformed how it is understood\nand used in philosophy, especially ethics. His view is briefly explained as follows:\nAt time 1, there is a person. At a later time 2, there is a person. These people seem to be the same\nperson. Indeed, these people share memories and personality traits. But there are no further facts in the\nworld that make them the same person.\nParfit's argument for this position relies on our intuitions regarding thought experiments such as\nteleportation, the fission and fusion of persons, gradual replacement of the matter in one's brain, gradual\nalteration of one's psychology, and so on. For example, Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a\n\"teletransporter,\" a machine that puts you to sleep, then destroys you, breaking you down into atoms,\ncopying the information and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light. On Mars, another machine re-\ncreates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative\nposition. Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel\u2014is the\nperson on Mars the same person as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth? Certainly, when\nwaking up on Mars, you would feel like being you, you would remember entering the teletransporter in\norder to travel to Mars, you would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning.\nThen the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who\nenters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering\nthe teletransporter on Earth in the first place.\nUsing thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine\nsameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact. What matters, to Parfit, is simply\n\"Relation R,\" psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.\nParfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is\nmorally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to\nprotect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it\nis also incumbent on society to protect an individual's \"Future Self\" from such transgressions; tobacco\nuse could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic\nto reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not\nexplicitly endorse such invasive control.\n1 This section is reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

For besides being reductive, Parfit's view is\nalso deflationary: in the end, \"what matters\" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and\nconnectedness.\nThe \u201cIdentity Doesn\u2019t Matter View\u201d2\nDavid Shoemaker has written an excellent explanation of Parfit\u2019s views and their implications. They\nare located in his entry on \u201cPersonal Identity and Ethics\u201d in the free Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy, which is a wonderful resource that you should read if you are interested in doing so. The\nquoted sections from his article that follow below along with my commentary and explanation are from\nSection 2.5 on \u201cThe Identity Doesn\u2019t Matter (IDM) View\u201d\nJohn Locke\u2019s view on personal identity, often called the \u201cLockean Memory Theory of Personal Identity\u201d\nis exactly as the name sounds: our personal identity is tied to our memories in one way or another, and\nwe have periods where we are conscious and make memories and periods where we are not (when we\nare sleeping, for example), and our identity consists of the whole of these memory-making moments.\nDerek Parfit generally agrees with this view on personal identity since it seems to match up with how we\nconceive of ourselves. On top of this, as Shoemaker explains, \u201cHe is a \u2018reductionist,\u2019 according to which\nthe facts about persons and personal identity consist in more particular facts about brains, bodies, and\nseries of interrelated mental and physical events (Parfit, Reasons and Persons, 1984, 210\u2013211). The\ndenial of reductionism is called \u2018nonreductionism,\u2019 according to which the facts about persons and\npersonal identity consist in some further fact, typically a fact about Cartesian egos or souls.\u201d Basically,\nthis means that Parfit denies anything like a \u201csoul\u201d and thinks we are identical to something we can\nquantify, measure, and point to directly that is associated with our memories.\nTo begin explaining why Parfit doesn\u2019t think that identity matters in survival (that is, how \u201cwe\u201d continue\nto exist as ourselves from moment to moment and day-to-day), Shoemaker says that Parfit \u201csuggests at\ntimes that the most plausible reductionist criterion of personal identity is the Psychological Criterion. As\nwe saw earlier, this criterion maintains that in order for X to be identical to Y, X must be uniquely\npsychologically continuous with Y. Psychological continuity is potentially a branching, one-many\nrelation, i.e., it could conceivably hold between me-now and more than one person in the future. But\nidentity is an equivalence relation \u2014 it is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive \u2014 so it holds only one-\none. Thus only by including a \u2018no branching\u2019 clause can this criterion of identity avoid a crippling\ncontradiction.\u201d\nAlong with the transporter experiment, Parfit outlines a \u201cfission\u201d experiment to help bolster his claim\nthat identity doesn\u2019t matter in survival. It works like this: assume that your brain exists in two halves\n(which they do, and they are called \u201chemispheres\u201d) and that both of these halves are identical to each\nother (which isn\u2019t a stretch, as this is hypothetically possible with how our brains can work). Now, you\nalso happen to be one member of a set of triplets, and at the same time your body gets irreversibly\ndamaged, your brothers\u2019 brains get irreversibly damaged. Half of your brain is then transplanted into\n2 The quotes in this section are from: Shoemaker, David, \"Personal Identity and Ethics\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/identity-ethics/\n12 Removing \u201cidentity\u201d from \u201cpersons\u201d: Derek Parfit 71 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\neach of the brothers. \u201cYou\u201d would not be \u201csplit\u201d into two identical parts. So where did \u201cyou\u201d go? As\nShoemaker puts it, \u201cIf we lack the \u201cno branching\u201d clause, we are forced to say that, because both\nbrothers are psychologically continuous with me, they are both me. But then (given the transitivity of\nidentity) both survivors would also have to be identical to each other, which seems obviously false\u2026\u201d\nSo, if identity means there can be only one of you, then there\u2019s a problem. Are you both of them?\nNeither? Are you dead? You can\u2019t be identical to either of them since picking one over the other would\nbe arbitrary. However, it does seem that \u201cyou\u201d survived in a very important sense.\nShoemaker continues,\n\u201cBut is this like an ordinary case in which I don't survive, i.e., like death? Clearly not: both\nsurvivors will seem to remember my thoughts and experiences, they will fulfill intentions I had\nin action, they will have the same beliefs/desires/goals as me, and their characters will be exactly\nlike mine. Indeed, it will be just as if I had survived. Everything that matters in ordinary survival\n(or nearly everything), therefore, is preserved in fission, despite the fact that the identity relation\nis not. What this must mean, then, is that the identity relation just is not what matters (or is not\nwhat matters very much) in survival; instead, what matters has to consist in psychological\ncontinuity and/or connectedness (what Parfit calls \u201cRelation R\u201d). As long as that relation holds\nbetween me-now and some other person-stage \u2014 regardless of whether or not it holds one-one\n\u2014 what happens to me is just as good as ordinary survival. Call this the Identity Doesn't Matter\n(IDM) view.\u201d\nWhat all this means is that our unique survival might not matter, and that identity then isn\u2019t as important\nas we thought, and that what matters is that things that are closely related to us using \u201cRelation R\u201d are\nwhat matters. This could have a drastic impact on how we approach our lives, ourselves, others, and\nthose things we value in the world. As Shoemaker explains the implications,\n\u201cSo let us assume that Relation R grounds our patterns of concern. Consider, then, prudential\nrationality. While it is ordinarily thought to be imprudent to discount the interests of one's Much\nLater Self (MLS) just because that self will not come into existence for a long time, Parfit\nsuggests that reductionism provides a different, more plausible reason to do so. Since one of the\nrelations in R (connectedness) obtains by degrees, it is very likely it will obtain to a much\nreduced degree between me-now and my MLS than it will between me-now and my tomorrow's\nself. But if R grounds my patterns of concern, and a reduced degree of connectedness is one part\nof R, then a reduced degree of connectedness justifies a reduced degree of concern. Thus, I may\nbe justified in caring much less about my MLS than about my tomorrow's self. This conclusion\njustifies discounting my MLS's (expected) interests in favor of my present interests.\nOf course, given that we still think great imprudence is wrong, how might we criticize it if we\nmade these revisions to our practices? One way to do so would be to recognize that, since my\nMLS would really be more like a different person than me, he should be treated as such, i.e., how\nI treat him should now fall under the rubric of morality, and insofar as it is wrong to harm others\nwithout their consent, it would be wrong for me to harm him as well. Great imprudence like this,\nin other words, would be immoral (Parfit 1984, 318\u2013320).\u201d\n12 Removing \u201cidentity\u201d from \u201cpersons\u201d: Derek Parfit 72 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThis results in something quite enlightening since it helps us understand why we might conceive of our\npast and future selves as very different than our current selves.

It is designed such that it can be carried out dispassionately by those who\nidentify as believers or non-believers.\nField of study\nPhilosophy of religion covers alternative beliefs about God, the varieties of religious experience, the\ninterplay between science and religion, the nature and scope of good and evil, and religious treatments\nof birth, history, and death. The field also includes the ethical implications of religious commitments,\nthe relation between faith, reason, experience and tradition, concepts of the miraculous, the sacred\nrevelation, mysticism, power, and salvation.\nThe philosophy of religion has been distinguished from theology by pointing out that, for theology, \"its\ncritical reflections are based on religious convictions\". Also, \"theology is responsible to an authority that\ninitiates its thinking, speaking, and witnessing ... [while] philosophy bases its arguments on the ground\nof timeless evidence.\"\nBasic themes and problems\nThree considerations that are basic to the philosophy of religion concerning deities are: the existence of\nGod, the nature of God, and the knowledge of God.\nExistence of God\nThere are several main positions with regard to the existence of God that one might take:\n1. Theism - the belief in the existence of one or more divinities or deities.\n1. Pantheism - the belief that God exists as all things of the cosmos, that God is one and all\nis God; God is immanent.\n2. Panentheism - the belief that God encompasses all things of the cosmos but that God is\ngreater than the cosmos; God is both immanent and transcendent.\n1 This section is reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

Deism - the belief that God does exist but does not interfere with human life and the laws\nof the universe; God is transcendent.\n4. Monotheism - the belief that a single deity exists which rules the universe as a separate\nand individual entity.\n5. Polytheism - the belief that multiple deities exist which rule the universe as separate and\nindividual entities.\n6. Henotheism - the belief that multiple deities may or may not exist, though there is a\nsingle supreme deity.\n7. Henology - believing that multiple avatars of a deity exist, which represent unique\naspects of the ultimate deity.\n2. Agnosticism - (literally, not knowing or without knowledge) the belief that the existence or non-\nexistence of deities or God is currently unknown or unknowable and cannot be proven. A weaker\nform of this might be defined as simply a lack of certainty about gods' existence or\nnonexistence.[]\n3. Atheism - the rejection of belief in the existence of deities.\n1. Weak atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist.\n2. Strong atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.\n4. Apatheism - a complete disinterest in, or lack of caring for, whether or not any deity or deities\nexists.\n5. Possibilianism\nThese are not mutually exclusive positions. For example, agnostic theists choose to believe God exists\nwhile asserting that knowledge of God's existence is inherently unknowable. Similarly, agnostic atheists\nreject belief in the existence of all deities, while asserting that whether any such entities exist or not is\ninherently unknowable.\nNatural theology\nThe attempt to provide proofs or arguments for the existence of God is one aspect of what is known as\nnatural theology or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief\nin God by independent grounds. There is plenty of philosophical literature on faith (especially fideism)\nand other subjects generally considered to be outside the realm of natural theology. Perhaps most of\nphilosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology's assumption that the existence of God can be\njustified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological\ndebate about the kinds of proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this discourse.\nThe philosopher Alvin Plantinga has shifted his focus to justifying belief in God (that is, those who\nbelieve in God, for whatever reasons, are rational in doing so) through Reformed epistemology, in the\ncontext of a theory of warrant and proper cognitive function.\nOther reactions to natural theology are those of Wittgensteinian philosophers of religion, most notably\nD. Z. Phillips. Phillips rejects \"natural theology\" and its evidentialist approach as confused, in favor of a\ngrammatical approach which investigates the meaning of belief in God. For Phillips, belief in God is not\na proposition with a particular truth value, but a form of life. Consequently, the question of whether God\nexists confuses the logical categories which govern theistic language with those that govern other forms\nof discourse (most notably, scientific discourse). According to Phillips, the question of whether or not\nUNIT THREE: PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 75 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nGod exists cannot be \"objectively\" answered by philosophy because the categories of truth and falsity,\nwhich are necessary for asking the question, have no application in the religious contexts wherein\nreligious belief has its sense and meaning. In other words, the question cannot be answered because it\ncannot be asked without entering into confusion. As Phillips sees things, the job of the philosopher is not\nto investigate the \"rationality\" of belief in God but to elucidate its meaning.\nProblem of evil\nMain articles: Problem of evil and Theodicy\nThe problem of evil is the question of how to reconcile the existence of evil with that of a deity who is,\nin either absolute or relative terms, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. An argument from evil\nattempts to show that the co-existence of evil and such a deity is unlikely or impossible if placed in\nabsolute terms. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of\ntheodicy.\nThe nature of God\nThere exists many understandings of the term \"God\". It typically differs not only from religion to\nreligion, but also from person to person who share the same religious beliefs. It is therefore hard to\ndefine \"God\" or list a complete array of characteristics (nature) of God that is applicable to all religions.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the concept of \"God\" is often described by philosophers of religion to be an \"\n1. Omniscient, 2. Omnipotent, 3. Omnibenevolent 4. Being\". Any \"God\" that is referred to in most\ncontexts of philosophy of religion must have the above four characteristics, including being a \"Being\".\nNote that this list is not exhaustive. There exists other characteristics of certain \"God\"s that are not\nincluded, for example, \"omnipresent\".\nAbove all, a simple \"if\" relationship exists between \"God\" and those four characteristics. That is to say.\nif X is a \"God\", X must possess all four characteristics. Yet, according to the above statement, the\nexistence of those four characteristics together on Y might not be sufficient to lead to the conclusion that\nY is a \"God\". However, the non-existence of one or more of the four characteristics on an object Z is\nsufficient to lead to the argument that Z is not a \"God\" that we have defined above.\nUNIT THREE: PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 76 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n13\nScience and Theology\nScience and Theology1\nThe relationship between science and theology has a long and complicated history that goes back four or\nfive hundred years. This discussion blends into an even longer debate over the relationship between\nreason and revelation. In response to science theology has undergone a profound reformulation. The\nEuropean Enlightenment and the rise of the historical-critical study of the Bible were also extremely\nimportant, but I will limit my attention to science. I am also focusing on the response of Protestant\ntheology to science, since that is the area I know best.\nI want to list four important challenges arising from science that called orthodox theology into question\nand brought about a major revision of Christian thought.\n1. The first challenge was that the success of scientific method called into question truth claims based on\nsupernatural revelation and tradition. Science has provided the modern world its most reliable standard\nof knowledge. Science is the dominant paradigm of truth about the world. At the extreme we get what\ncan be called scientism: What cannot be known by science not only cannot be known but is not real.\nAlong with this there was in many quarters a loss of confidence in speculative reason under the\ninfluence of philosophers like David Hume and Immanuel Kant. In the minds of many they demolished\nthe traditional arguments for the existence of God. This took place in the context of the Enlightenment,\nwhich urged people to think for themselves. It called into question all ancient traditions, superstitions,\nand any claims about reality that could not stand the test of enlightened reason. The great themes of the\nEnlightenment were reason, nature, and progress. If we will use our reason to understand nature and\nhistory, we can make material and moral progress as we move toward an ultimate perfection of life on\nearth. Among the resources of reason none was more important than science in providing the truth that\nwould enlighten us and help us make life better. Science was based on evidence we could test. It solved\none problem after another. It worked. It was creating a picture of the world and of human beings that\nwas so convincing to so many that it gradually weakened other ways of knowing or pushed them aside.\nFor Christians it raised a disturbing question: If the Bible could be wrong in matters of fact, could it also\nbe wrong about matters of faith?\n2. The second challenge was that science undermined biblical cosmology. The Bible had provided\nChristian Europe its basic story of the origin of the cosmos and the structure of the natural world for\n1500 hundred years. Between 1500-1900 of the Christian era, this understanding was demolished. The\nbiblical picture was that of a three-story universe with the earth in the middle, heaven above, and hell\nbelow. This world came into being a few thousand years ago with all the species of plant and animal life\n1 This section, written by Dr. Kenneth Cauthen in 2000, has been graciously released under a CC-BY-SA license so that it\nmay be included in this volume\n13 Science and Theology 77 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nreproducing after their kind. Adam and Eve were real people living in a garden that could roughly be\nlocated on a map. A series of discoveries from Copernicus to Darwin demonstrated that picture of the\nuniverse and of human origins to be in error. Copernicus showed that the earth was not in the center of\nthe world. His suggestion that the sun was the center was also wrong, but that is another story. Next\ngeology revealed the earth to be much older than the biblical chronology allowed. Then came Darwin\nwith the big bombshell. In 1859 the world was shaken by the claim that present species of life have\nevolved over a long period of time by natural selection to produce the forms of life that now inhabit the\nearth. The most disturbing feature of this theory was that human beings did not descend from Adam and\nEve a few thousand years ago but evolved from earlier species that could be traced back to the first\nbeginnings of life on earth far in the distant past.\nThe Christian world was deeply disturbed. A few came pretty quickly to the conclusion that Darwin was\nright. They saw that there was no point in trying to resist. Others were upset and simply refused to\nbelieve it. They insisted that the Bible not science gave us the true picture. In England Bishop\nWilberforce reacted with sarcasm. He asked Julian Huxley, the great scientist, whether it was on his\nmother's side or his father's side that he was descended from apes. An upper class, aristocratic British\nlady upon hearing about Darwin's theory said, \"Oh dear, that is so dreadful. Let us hope it is not true.\nBut if it is, let us keep quiet about it.\" In America Charles Hodge, the eminent Presbyterian theologian at\nPrinceton, said that Darwinism is atheism. This was all taking place from 1860-1900. I saw a book by a\nfundamentalist Christian written in this century who said that he had seen performers in the circus riding\ntwo horses at one time, one foot on one horse and the other foot on the other. However, he noted that he\nhad never seen this done when the horses were going in opposite directions. In his mind the Bible and\nevolution were going in opposite directions.\nThis, then, is the second impact of science. It undermined the biblical picture of the physical and\nbiological world. The controversy raised by Darwin goes on today. Liberal Christians accept evolution\nand revise their view of the Bible and of the world accordingly. Fundamentalists still insist that Darwin\nwas wrong and the Bible is right. Some want creationism taught in the public schools along with\nevolution.\n3. The third challenge was the fact that the scientific picture of a law-abiding world called into question\nthe reality of miracle and the supernatural. Science pictures nature as a dynamic, causal network, self-\ncontained and self-explanatory. There is one order of activities in which all events occur in a law-\nabiding fashion. In this view miracles are suspect. The Bible is full of miracles from the Red Sea\nincident to the Virgin Birth of Jesus and his Resurrection from the dead, to mention only a few. John\nCalvin had used miracles and the fulfillment of prophesy as evidence of the truth of Scripture. Now it\nwas miracles themselves that were in question. Could Christians live everyday in a world that abided by\nthe laws of nature and then go to church on Sunday and believe in miracles that violated them?\n4. The fourth challenge was that the picture of nature as a self-contained causal system called into\nquestion the need for a supernatural creator or for any reference to divine purpose. From the 17th\ncentury beginnings until the 20th century revolutions in physical science, the natural order had been\ndescribed by science in mechanistic, deterministic, materialist terms. Nature consists of bits of material\nstuff - matter - organized into a machine that operates in accordance with inexorable laws. The natural\norder is at best a neutral and at worst a meaningless process. There are causes but no reasons or purposes\nin nature. In nature there is no freedom, no meaning, or value. This is the most powerful and daunting\n13 Science and Theology 78 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nchallenge of all. Science seemed to imply a universe that needed no God to create it. It was a machine\nthat required no explanation beyond itself. This machine did just what it did do, not knowing or caring\nwhat it did or having any purpose in doing it . In 1903 Bertrand Russell offered the most extreme\nsummary of this outlook by saying that the world science presents for our belief is meaningless and void\nof purpose, an accidental collocation of atoms.2 A lot of people, including myself, do not think that\npresent-day science requires this world-view, but it prevailed for 300 years.3 Moreover, many scientists\ntoday still hold that nature is full of causes but exemplifies no purpose.4\nWe could go on with this at great length. I have by no means given the complete picture, but let me turn\nnow to the response of theology to these challenges. Let me speak briefly of two main types of response.\nI will then divide the second type into two sub-groups. This will leave out a lot that needs to be said to\nget the complete picture, but it will at least give some hint as to how Christian theology has met the\nchallenge of modern science. I will call the two basic responses by the short-hand terms of\nfundamentalism and liberalism, recognizing that each of these schools of thought comes in many\nvarieties. Moreover, some views would fall in between. To get the main point before us at once, let me\nsay that fundamentalism says the Bible is right about everything, and that if science says something\ndifferent, it must be rejected. Liberals say that science and the Bible are both right within their own\nlegitimate spheres, but they deal with different aspects of reality. Therefore, there need not be any\nconflict between science and theology.\nFundamentalism: Fundamentalists hold the view that the Bible is inerrant, without error. It tells the truth\nabout everything it mentions. It is right about nature, the universe, the origin of human beings, the\nreproduction of species, and so on. All of its historical claims are true. The miracle stories happened just\nthe way the Bible says. There is to be no compromise of biblical truth. The Bible is the Word of God in\na full, complete, total manner and in all respects. Hence, if the Bible teaches that Adam and Eve were\nliteral people living a garden somewhere on earth that we could locate on earth, then that story is just\ntrue. If evolution teaches something contrary to what the right interpretation of Scripture requires, then it\nis wrong. True science is in harmony with the Bible. Whatever contradicts the Bible is bad science.\nSome conservatives have made a variety of accommodations to science with respect to biblical\ncosmology, the age of the earth, and even evolution. Some even venture to distinguish between matters\nof science not essential to religious truth and matters of faith in which the Bible is without any error at\nall. As the recognition of the authority of science grows with respect to its own legitimate field of\n2 Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship, 1903. This essay can be found in Volume 12 of The Collected Papers of Bertrand\nRussell, entitled Contemplation and Action, 1902-14 (London: Routledge, 1985). The full relevant paragraph is as\nfollows:Such, in outline, but even more purposeless, more void of meaning, is the world which Science presents for our\nbelief. Amid such a world, if anywhere, our ideals henceforward must find a home. That Man is the product of causes which\nhad no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are\nbut the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve\nan individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday\nbrightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of\nMan's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins--all these things, if not quite beyond\ndispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of\nthese truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built.\n3 I learned this story best from Alfred North Whitehead, Science and the Modern World (New York: The Macmillan Co.,\n1925). It has been told many other times by numerous authors. The literature on the subject is immense.\n4 An example is found in Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why The Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe\nWithout Design (New York: W. W. Norton, 1986). In The First Three Minutes Steven Weinberg, Nobel Prize-winning\ntheoretical physicist, wrote, \"the more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.\"\n13 Science and Theology 79 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\ninquiry, the closer it comes to blending in with a moderate liberal approach. At some point the\nboundaries between science and theology and between fundamentalism and liberalism may become\nfuzzy.\nLiberalism: What all forms of liberalism agree on is that science is not to be contested on its own terms.\nIf the scientific evidence shows conclusively that evolution occurred in the way that present-day science\nsays it did, then it must be accepted. We simply have to come to terms with it. The basic way of doing\nthat is to distinguish between the realms that science and religion deal with. Here let me distinguish\nvery broadly between two sub-types of liberal thinking that make the distinction between science and\ntheology in somewhat different ways. They agree with the basic liberal premise is that we must\ndistinguish between two spheres of knowledge about reality.\n1. The first approach is deeply influenced by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Kant distinguished\nbetween the realm of fact that science deals with and the realm of value that morality and religion deal\nwith. It is true that science presents us with a world of fact that is law-abiding and void of freedom and\nvalue. However, we have another faculty of understanding as moral persons who are free, who can live\nin accordance with duty, and make value judgments. Theology interprets the moral and religious realms.\nScience and religion cannot contradict each other since they deal with different spheres of human\nactivity and deal with the world in different ways. Many theologians in the 19th and 20th centuries have\ntaken their clues from Kant. Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, Rudolf Bultmann, and H. Richard Niebuhr fall\ninto this camp. Existential theology under the joint influence of Kant and Kierkegaard takes this\napproach. The world, then, is one order of activities that human beings deal with in two different ways.\nOn the one hand, we have the realm of fact, law, cause, and determinism. On the other hand, we have\nthe realm of value, meaning, purpose, and freedom. Morality and religion are in this second sphere, and\ntheology is the interpreter of the moral and religious experience of human beings in relation to God.\nScience neither contradicts or supports religion. It has its own methods and its own subject matter. The\nsame is true of theology. It cannot call into question the findings of science, but it can accept them\nwhatever they are and then go on to make its own claims based on Scripture, tradition, reason, and\nexperience. However, it does mean that much of the Bible cannot be taken literally. The Bible is not a\nbook of science. The creation stories Genesis have to be seen as myths that contain moral and religious\ntruth for our lives today in a world that was produced by a long evolutionary process. Many liberals\nrejected the virgin birth and the literal resurrection of Jesus and many other miracle stories because these\nmiracles are contrary to what science knows about physical and biological laws. Science tells us about\nfacts. Religion tells us about values - to oversimplify the matter.\nIt is important to recognize that this view holds that it does not matter to faith what science says about\nthe nature of the world. In the 19th century and on into the early 20th the prevailing scientific\ncosmology was materialistic, mechanistic, and materialistic. Nature is a realm without freedom,\nmeaning, and value. If 20th century science after relativity, quantum mechanics, indeterminacy, and the\nlike no longer implies this particular world-view, then it does not matter much. Faith does not look to\nscience for its foundations, and it is not threatened by anything that science could possibly say. Hence,\ntheology can be basically indifferent to any and all cosmologies that implied by the scientific account of\nnature and the world of observable objects. Faith has to do with the decisions and commitments of\n13 Science and Theology 80 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nselves in quest of meaning and purpose as moral personalities. The two realms may converse with each\nother, but neither can undermine or support the other.5\n2. The second type of liberal approach is very much like the first in many ways. It differs primarily in\nthat it does not make a sharp division between science and theology or between facts and values. Instead\nof a dualism between the world as known by disinterested observers, on the one hand, and committed\nmoral selves, on the other hand, this approach speaks of different dimensions of the same events or\nthings as objective entities. Science gives us a partial picture of the whole. It gives us one perspective on\nthe world. The full and complete reality has many dimensions, some of which are not discerned by\nscientific methods. The part it deals with by its particular approach is completely true within those\nlimits. Science abstracts from the whole and investigates nature in so far as it can be observed by the\nsenses or measured and quantified with the aid of technology. Philosophy is needed to ask about the\nnature and meaning of the totality, about reality in its fulness and wholeness. Science gives us a\nperspective on the whole, but it does not tell us the whole truth about the whole of reality. Philosophy\nmust do that, and theology does the same with the special task of interpreting the meaning of the\nChristian tradition within this framework. Process theology under the influence of Alfred North\nWhitehead is the best example of this approach. It is much like the first liberal type but instead of a\nsharp dualism between science and theology or between facts and values, the second speaks of part and\nwhole. Science deals with the dimension of reality that its methods allow it to examine. Philosophy deals\nwith the whole from which science abstracts. Theology deals with the moral and religious dimensions of\nthe whole of reality and focuses on the reality of God in relation to the world and human beings.\nSo each of these liberal types holds that science and theology deal with different subject matter or with\nthe same subject matter in different ways. Theology can be true in its sphere, and science can be true in\nits sphere, and neither interferes with or contradicts the work of the other.\nIt is a lot more complicated than this, but I will leave it at this for now.6\n5\nSee Kenneth Cauthen, The Impact of American Religious Liberalism (New York: Harper & Row, 1962). Check the index\nunder \"science\" for the relevant pages.\n6 I have written extensively on science and theology. In addition to ibid., see my Science, Secularization and God (Nashville:\nAbingdon Press, 1969), Theological Biology (Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen Press, 1991), and Toward a New Modernism\n(Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1997).\n13 Science and Theology 81 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n14\nPascal\u2019s Wager\nThe Wager1\n343 (6-233)\nIf there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having neither parts nor limits, He has no\naffinity to us. We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is. This being so, who will\ndare to undertake the decision of the question? Not we, who have no affinity to Him.\nWho then will blame Christians for not being able to give a reason for their belief, since they profess a\nreligion for which they cannot give a reason? They declare, in expounding it to the world, that it is a\nfoolishness, I Cor. 1. 21. [\"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it\npleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\"]; and then you complain that\nthey do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is in lacking proofs that they\nare not lacking in sense. \"Yes, but although this excuses those who offer it as such and takes away from\nthem the blame of putting it forward without reason, it does not excuse those who receive it.\" Let us then\nexamine this point, and say, \"God is, or He is not.\" But to which side shall we incline? Reason can\ndecide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being played at the\nextremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager? According to\nreason, you can do neither the one thing nor the other; according to reason, you can defend neither of the\npropositions.\nDo not, then, reprove for error those who have made a choice; for you know nothing about it. \"No, but I\nblame them for having made, not this choice, but a choice; for again both he who chooses heads and he\nwho chooses tails are equally at fault, they are both in the wrong. The true course is not to wager at all.\"\nYes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which will you choose then? Let us see.\nSince you must choose, let us see which interests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the\ngood; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your\nnature has two things to shun, error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather\nthan the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point settled. But your happiness? Let us\nweigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you\ngain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. \"That is very fine. Yes,\nI must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much.\" Let us see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of\nloss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. But if there were three lives\nto gain, you would have to play (since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would be\nimprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain three at a game where there is an\n1 From Blaise Pascal's Pens\u00e9es, published in 1670 after his death in 1662, translated by W. F. Trotter in 1910\n14 Pascal\u2019s Wager 82 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nequal risk of loss and gain. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if there were\nan infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you, you would still be right in wagering one to\nwin two, and you would act stupidly, being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against three at\na game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if there were an infinity of an\ninfinitely happy life to gain. But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of\ngain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. It is all divided; where-ever\nthe infinite is and there is not an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no time to\nhesitate, you must give all. And thus, when one is forced to play, he must renounce reason to preserve\nhis life, rather than risk it for infinite gain, as likely to happen as the loss of nothingness.\nFor it is no use to say it is uncertain if we will gain, and it is certain that we risk, and that the infinite\ndistance between the certainly of what is staked and the uncertainty of what will be gained, equals the\nfinite good which is certainly staked against the uncertain infinite. It is not so, as every player stakes a\ncertainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a finite certainty to gain a finite uncertainty, without\ntransgressing against reason. There is not an infinite distance between the certainty staked and the\nuncertainty of the gain; that is untrue. In truth, there is an infinity between the certainty of gain and the\ncertainty of loss. But the uncertainty of the gain is proportioned to the certainty of the stake according to\nthe proportion of the chances of gain and loss. Hence it comes that, if there are as many risks on one side\nas on the other, the course is to play even; and then the certainty of the stake is equal to the uncertainty\nof the gain, so far is it from fact that there is an infinite distance between them. And so our proposition is\nof infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of\nloss, and the infinite to gain. This is demonstrable; and if men are capable of any truths, this is one.\n\"I confess it, I admit it. But, still, is there no means of seeing the faces of the cards?\" Yes, Scripture and\nthe rest, etc. \"Yes, but I have my hands tied and my mouth closed; I am forced to wager, and am not\nfree. I am not released, and am so made that I cannot believe. What, then, would you have me do?\"\nTrue. But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot\nbelieve. Endeavor, then, to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of God, but by the abatement of\nyour passions. You would like to attain faith and do not know the way; you would like to cure yourself\nof unbelief and ask the remedy for it. Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake\nall their possessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow, and who are cured\nof an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they\nbelieved, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and\ndeaden your acuteness. \"But this is what I am afraid of.\" And why? What have you to lose?\nBut to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will lessen the passions, which are your\nstumbling-blocks.\nThe end of this discourse.-- Now, what harm will befall you in taking this side? You will be faithful,\nhumble, grateful, generous, a sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not have those poisonous\npleasures, glory and luxury; but will you not have others? I will tell you that you will thereby gain in this\nlife, and that, at each step you take on this road, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much\nnothingness in what you risk, that you will at last recognize that you have wagered for something certain\nand infinite, for which you have given nothing.\n14 Pascal\u2019s Wager 83 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n15\nAnselm\u2019s Ontological Argument and\nGaunilo\u2019s Lost Island\nAnselm\u2019s \u201cOntological Argument\u201d1\nTherefore, Lord, you who give knowledge of the faith, give me as much knowledge as you know to be\nfitting for me, because you are as we believe and that which we believe. And indeed we believe you are\nsomething greater than which cannot be thought. Or is there no such kind of thing, for \"the fool said in\nhis heart, 'there is no God'\" (Ps. 13:1, 52:1)? But certainly that same fool, having heard what I just said,\n\"something greater than which cannot be thought,\" understands what he heard, and what he understands\nis in his thought, even if he does not think it exists. For it is one thing for something to exist in a person's\nthought and quite another for the person to think that thing exists. For when a painter thinks ahead to\nwhat he will paint, he has that picture in his thought, but he does not yet think it exists, because he has\nnot done it yet. Once he has painted it he has it in his thought and thinks it exists because he has done it.\nThus even the fool is compelled to grant that something greater than which cannot be thought exists in\nthought, because he understands what he hears, and whatever is understood exists in thought. And\ncertainly that greater than which cannot be understood cannot exist only in thought, for if it exists only\nin thought it could also be thought of as existing in reality as well, which is greater. If, therefore, that\nthan which greater cannot be thought exists in thought alone, then that than which greater cannot be\nthought turns out to be that than which something greater actually can be thought, but that is obviously\nimpossible. Therefore something than which greater cannot be thought undoubtedly exists both in\nthought and in reality.\nGaunilo\u2019s \u201cLost Island Objection\u201d\nFor example, they say there is in the ocean somewhere an island which, due to the difficulty (or rather\nthe impossibility) of finding what does not actually exist, is called \"the lost island.\" And they say that\nthis island has all manner of riches and delights, even more of them than the Isles of the Blest, and\nhaving no owner or inhabitant it is superior in the abundance of its riches to all other lands which are\ninhabited by men. If someone should tell me that such is the case, I will find it easy to understand what\nhe says, since there is nothing difficult about it. But suppose he then adds, as if he were stating a logical\nconsequence, \"Well then, you can no longer doubt that this island more excellent than all other lands\nreally exists somewhere, since you do not doubt that it is in your mind; and since it is more excellent to\nexist not only in the mind but in reality as well, this island must necessarily exist, because if it didn't,\nany other island really existing would be more excellent than it, and thus that island now thought of by\nyou as more excellent will not be such.\" If, I say, someone tries to convince me though this argument\nthat the island really exists and there should be no more doubt about it, I will either think he is joking or\nI will have a hard time deciding who is the bigger fool, me if I believe him or him if he thinks he has\nproved its existence without having first convinced me that this excellence is something undoubtedly\nexisting in reality and not just something false or uncertain existing in my mind.\n1 Both Anselm\u2019s Argument and Gaunilo\u2019s response were written around 1078, Translated by Sidney Norton in 1903\n15 Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument and Gaunilo\u2019s Lost Island 84 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n16\nAquinas\u2019 Cosmological Argument\nSumma Theologiae1\nArticle 1. Whether the existence of God is self-evident?\nObjection 1. It seems that the existence of God is self-evident. Now those things are said to be self-\nevident to us the knowledge of which is naturally implanted in us, as we can see in regard to first\nprinciples. But as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 1,3), \"the knowledge of God is naturally implanted\nin all.\" Therefore the existence of God is self-evident.\nObjection 2. Further, those things are said to be self-evident which are known as soon as the terms are\nknown, which the Philosopher (1 Poster. iii) says is true of the first principles of demonstration. Thus,\nwhen the nature of a whole and of a part is known, it is at once recognized that every whole is greater\nthan its part. But as soon as the signification of the word \"God\" is understood, it is at once seen that God\nexists. For by this word is signified that thing than which nothing greater can be conceived. But that\nwhich exists actually and mentally is greater than that which exists only mentally. Therefore, since as\nsoon as the word \"God\" is understood it exists mentally, it also follows that it exists actually. Therefore\nthe proposition \"God exists\" is self-evident.\nObjection 3. Further, the existence of truth is self-evident. For whoever denies the existence of truth\ngrants that truth does not exist: and, if truth does not exist, then the proposition \"Truth does not exist\" is\ntrue: and if there is anything true, there must be truth. But God is truth itself: \"I am the way, the truth,\nand the life\" (John 14:6) Therefore \"God exists\" is self-evident.\nOn the contrary, No one can mentally admit the opposite of what is self-evident; as the Philosopher\n(Metaph. iv, lect. vi) states concerning the first principles of demonstration. But the opposite of the\nproposition \"God is\" can be mentally admitted: \"The fool said in his heart, There is no God\" (Psalm\n53:2). Therefore, that God exists is not self-evident.\nI answer that, A thing can be self-evident in either of two ways: on the one hand, self-evident in itself,\nthough not to us; on the other, self-evident in itself, and to us. A proposition is self-evident because the\npredicate is included in the essence of the subject, as \"Man is an animal,\" for animal is contained in the\nessence of man. If, therefore the essence of the predicate and subject be known to all, the proposition\nwill be self-evident to all; as is clear with regard to the first principles of demonstration, the terms of\nwhich are common things that no one is ignorant of, such as being and non-being, whole and part, and\nsuch like. If, however, there are some to whom the essence of the predicate and subject is unknown, the\nproposition will be self-evident in itself, but not to those who do not know the meaning of the predicate\n1 St. Thomas Aquinas\u2019 Summa Theologiae, 1485, Translated 1920 by Fathers of the English Dominican Province\n16 Aquinas\u2019 Cosmological Argument 85 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nand subject of the proposition. Therefore, it happens, as Boethius says (Hebdom., the title of which is:\n\"Whether all that is, is good\"), \"that there are some mental concepts self-evident only to the learned, as\nthat incorporeal substances are not in space.\" Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God exists,\" of itself\nis self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject, because God is His own existence as will be\nhereafter shown (I:3:4). Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-\nevident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in\ntheir nature \u2014 namely, by effects.\nReply to Objection 1. To know that God exists in a general and confused way is implanted in us by\nnature, inasmuch as God is man's beatitude. For man naturally desires happiness, and what is naturally\ndesired by man must be naturally known to him. This, however, is not to know absolutely that God\nexists; just as to know that someone is approaching is not the same as to know that Peter is approaching,\neven though it is Peter who is approaching; for many there are who imagine that man's perfect good\nwhich is happiness, consists in riches, and others in pleasures, and others in something else.\nReply to Objection 2. Perhaps not everyone who hears this word \"God\" understands it to signify\nsomething than which nothing greater can be thought, seeing that some have believed God to be a body.\nYet, granted that everyone understands that by this word \"God\" is signified something than which\nnothing greater can be thought, nevertheless, it does not therefore follow that he understands that what\nthe word signifies exists actually, but only that it exists mentally. Nor can it be argued that it actually\nexists, unless it be admitted that there actually exists something than which nothing greater can be\nthought; and this precisely is not admitted by those who hold that God does not exist.\nReply to Objection 3. The existence of truth in general is self-evident but the existence of a Primal\nTruth is not self-evident to us.\nArticle 2. Whether it can be demonstrated that God exists?\nObjection 1. It seems that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated. For it is an article of faith that\nGod exists. But what is of faith cannot be demonstrated, because a demonstration produces scientific\nknowledge; whereas faith is of the unseen (Hebrews 11:1). Therefore it cannot be demonstrated that God\nexists.\nObjection 2. Further, the essence is the middle term of demonstration. But we cannot know in what\nGod's essence consists, but solely in what it does not consist; as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 4).\nTherefore we cannot demonstrate that God exists.\nObjection 3. Further, if the existence of God were demonstrated, this could only be from His effects.\nBut His effects are not proportionate to Him, since He is infinite and His effects are finite; and between\nthe finite and infinite there is no proportion. Therefore, since a cause cannot be demonstrated by an\neffect not proportionate to it, it seems that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated.\nOn the contrary, The Apostle says: \"The invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being understood by\nthe things that are made\" (Romans 1:20). But this would not be unless the existence of God could be\ndemonstrated through the things that are made; for the first thing we must know of anything is whether it\nexists.\n16 Aquinas\u2019 Cosmological Argument 86 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nI answer that, Demonstration can be made in two ways: One is through the cause, and is called \"a\npriori,\" and this is to argue from what is prior absolutely. The other is through the effect, and is called a\ndemonstration \"a posteriori\"; this is to argue from what is prior relatively only to us. When an effect is\nbetter known to us than its cause, from the effect we proceed to the knowledge of the cause. And from\nevery effect the existence of its proper cause can be demonstrated, so long as its effects are better known\nto us; because since every effect depends upon its cause, if the effect exists, the cause must pre-exist.\nHence the existence of God, in so far as it is not self-evident to us, can be demonstrated from those of\nHis effects which are known to us.\nReply to Objection 1. The existence of God and other like truths about God, which can be known by\nnatural reason, are not articles of faith, but are preambles to the articles; for faith presupposes natural\nknowledge, even as grace presupposes nature, and perfection supposes something that can be perfected.\nNevertheless, there is nothing to prevent a man, who cannot grasp a proof, accepting, as a matter of\nfaith, something which in itself is capable of being scientifically known and demonstrated.\nReply to Objection 2. When the existence of a cause is demonstrated from an effect, this effect takes\nthe place of the definition of the cause in proof of the cause's existence. This is especially the case in\nregard to God, because, in order to prove the existence of anything, it is necessary to accept as a middle\nterm the meaning of the word, and not its essence, for the question of its essence follows on the question\nof its existence. Now the names given to God are derived from His effects; consequently, in\ndemonstrating the existence of God from His effects, we may take for the middle term the meaning of\nthe word \"God\".\nReply to Objection 3. From effects not proportionate to the cause no perfect knowledge of that cause\ncan be obtained. Yet from every effect the existence of the cause can be clearly demonstrated, and so we\ncan demonstrate the existence of God from His effects; though from them we cannot perfectly know\nGod as He is in His essence.\nArticle 3. Whether God exists?\nObjection 1. It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other\nwould be altogether destroyed. But the word \"God\" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore,\nGod existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not\nexist.\nObjection 2. Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has\nbeen produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other\nprinciples, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is\nnature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will.\nTherefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.\nOn the contrary, It is said in the person of God: \"I am Who am.\" (Exodus 3:14)\nI answer that, The existence of God can be proved in five ways.\n16 Aquinas\u2019 Cosmological Argument 87 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThe first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is certain, and evident to our senses,\nthat in the world some things are in motion. Now whatever is in motion is put in motion by another, for\nnothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to that towards which it is in motion; whereas a thing\nmoves inasmuch as it is in act. For motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from\npotentiality to actuality. But nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by something\nin a state of actuality. Thus that which is actually hot, as fire, makes wood, which is potentially hot, to\nbe actually hot, and thereby moves and changes it. Now it is not possible that the same thing should be\nat once in actuality and potentiality in the same respect, but only in different respects. For what is\nactually hot cannot simultaneously be potentially hot; but it is simultaneously potentially cold. It is\ntherefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and\nmoved, i.e. that it should move itself. Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in motion by\nanother. If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must needs be put in\nmotion by another, and that by another again. But this cannot go on to infinity, because then there would\nbe no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover; seeing that subsequent movers move only\ninasmuch as they are put in motion by the first mover; as the staff moves only because it is put in motion\nby the hand. Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this\neveryone understands to be God.\nThe second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order\nof efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to\nbe the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient\ncauses it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is\nthe cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the\nintermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect.\nTherefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any\nintermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first\nefficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of\nwhich is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives\nthe name of God.\nThe third way is taken from possibility and necessity, and runs thus. We find in nature things that are\npossible to be and not to be, since they are found to be generated, and to corrupt, and consequently, they\nare possible to be and not to be. But it is impossible for these always to exist, for that which is possible\nnot to be at some time is not. Therefore, if everything is possible not to be, then at one time there could\nhave been nothing in existence. Now if this were true, even now there would be nothing in existence,\nbecause that which does not exist only begins to exist by something already existing. Therefore, if at one\ntime nothing was in existence, it would have been impossible for anything to have begun to exist; and\nthus even now nothing would be in existence \u2014 which is absurd. Therefore, not all beings are merely\npossible, but there must exist something the existence of which is necessary. But every necessary thing\neither has its necessity caused by another, or not. Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary\nthings which have their necessity caused by another, as has been already proved in regard to efficient\ncauses. Therefore we cannot but postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity,\nand not receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity. This all men speak of as\nGod.\n16 Aquinas\u2019 Cosmological Argument 88 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThe fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things. Among beings there are some more\nand some less good, true, noble and the like. But \"more\" and \"less\" are predicated of different things,\naccording as they resemble in their different ways something which is the maximum, as a thing is said to\nbe hotter according as it more nearly resembles that which is hottest; so that there is something which is\ntruest, something best, something noblest and, consequently, something which is uttermost being; for\nthose things that are greatest in truth are greatest in being, as it is written in Metaph. ii. Now the\nmaximum in any genus is the cause of all in that genus; as fire, which is the maximum heat, is the cause\nof all hot things. Therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being,\ngoodness, and every other perfection; and this we call God.\nThe fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack intelligence,\nsuch as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in\nthe same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not fortuitously, but designedly, do\nthey achieve their end. Now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be\ndirected by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the\narcher. Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and\nthis being we call God.\nReply to Objection 1. As Augustine says (Enchiridion xi): \"Since God is the highest good, He would\nnot allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring\ngood even out of evil.\" This is part of the infinite goodness of God, that He should allow evil to exist,\nand out of it produce good.\nReply to Objection 2. Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent,\nwhatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is\ndone voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since\nthese can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to\nan immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.\n16 Aquinas\u2019 Cosmological Argument 89 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n17\nPaley\u2019s Watchmaker Argument\nThe Teleological Argument1\nCHAPTER I.\nSTATE OF THE ARGUMENT.\nIN crossing a health, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to\nbe there; I might possibly answer, that, for any thing I knew to the contrary, it had lain there for ever:\nnor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch\nupon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly\nthink of the answer which I had before given, that, for any thing I knew, the watch might have always\nbeen there. Yet why should not this answer serve for the watch as well as for the stone? why is it not as\nadmissible in the second case, as in the first? For this reason, and for no other, viz. that, when we come\nto inspect the watch, we perceive (what we could not discover in the stone) that its several parts are\nframed and put together for a purpose, e. g. that they are so formed and adjusted as to produce motion,\nand that motion so regulated as to point out the hour of the day; that, if the different parts had been\ndifferently shaped from what they are, of a different size from what they are, or placed after any other\nmanner, or in any other order, than that in which they are placed, either no motion at all would have\nbeen carried on in the machine, or none which would have answered the use that is now served by it. To\nreckon up a few of the plainest of these parts, and of their offices, all tending to one result:-- We see a\ncylindrical box containing a coiled elastic spring, which, by its endeavour to relax itself, turns round the\nbox. We next observe a flexible chain (artificially wrought for the sake of flexure), communicating the\naction of the spring from the box to the fusee. We then find a series of wheels, the teeth of which catch\nin, and apply to, each other, conducting the motion from the fusee to the balance, and from the balance\nto the pointer; and at the same time, by the size and shape of those wheels, so regulating that motion, as\nto terminate in causing an index, by an equable and measured progression, to pass over a given space in\na given time. We take notice that the wheels are made of brass in order to keep them from rust; the\nsprings of steel, no other metal being so elastic; that over the face of the watch there is placed a glass, a\nmaterial employed in no other part of the work, but in the room of which, if there had been any other\nthan a transparent substance, the hour could not be seen without opening the case. This mechanism\nbeing observed (it requires indeed an examination of the instrument, and perhaps some previous\nknowledge of the subject, to perceive and understand it; but being once, as we have said, observed and\nunderstood), the inference, we think, is inevitable, that the watch must have had a maker: that there must\nhave existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers who formed it for the\npurpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use.\n1 From Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, by William Paley, 1802\n17 Paley\u2019s Watchmaker Argument 90 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nI. Nor would it, I apprehend, weaken the conclusion, that we had never seen a watch made; that we had\nnever known an artist capable of making one; that we were altogether incapable of executing such a\npiece of workmanship ourselves, or of understanding in what manner it was performed; all this being no\nmore than what is true of some exquisite remains of ancient art, of some lost arts, and, to the generality\nof mankind, of the more curious productions of modern manufacture. Does one man in a million know\nhow oval frames are turned? Ignorance of this kind exalts our opinion of the unseen and unknown artist's\nskill, if he be unseen and unknown, but raises no doubt in our minds of the existence and agency of such\nan artist, at some former time, and in some place or other. Nor can I perceive that it varies at all the\ninference, whether the question arise concerning a human agent, or concerning an agent of a different\nspecies, or an agent possessing, in some respects, a different nature.\nII. Neither, secondly, would it invalidate our conclusion, that the watch sometimes went wrong, or that it\nseldom went exactly right. The purpose of the machinery, the design, and the designer, might be evident,\nand in the case supposed would be evident, in whatever way we accounted for the irregularity of the\nmovement, or whether we could account for it or not. It is not necessary that a machine be perfect, in\norder to show with what design it was made: still less necessary, where the only question is, whether it\nwere made with any design at all.\nIII. Nor, thirdly, would it bring any uncertainty into the argument, if there were a few parts of the watch,\nconcerning which we could not discover, or had not yet discovered, in what manner they conduced to\nthe general effect; or even some parts, concerning which we could not ascertain, whether they conduced\nto that effect in any manner whatever. For, as to the first branch of the case; if by the loss, or disorder, or\ndecay of the parts in question, the movement of the watch were found in fact to be stopped, or disturbed,\nor retarded, no doubt would remain in our minds as to the utility or intention of these parts, although we\nshould be unable to investigate the manner according to which, or the connexion by which, the ultimate\neffect depended upon their action or assistance; and the more complex is the machine, the more likely is\nthis obscurity to arise. Then, as to the second thing supposed, namely, that there were parts which might\nbe spared, without prejudice to the movement of the watch, and that we had proved this by experiment,--\nthese superfluous parts, even if we were completely assured that they were such, would not vacate the\nreasoning which we had instituted concerning other parts. The indication of contrivance remained, with\nrespect to them, nearly as it was before.\nIV. Nor, fourthly, would any man in his senses think the existence of the watch, with its various\nmachinery, accounted for, by being told that it was one out of possible combinations of material forms;\nthat whatever he had found in the place where he found the watch, must have contained some internal\nconfiguration or other; and that this configuration might be the structure now exhibited, viz. of the works\nof a watch, as well as a different structure.\nV. Nor, fifthly, would it yield his inquiry more satisfaction to be answered, that there existed in things a\nprinciple of order, which had disposed the parts of the watch into their present form and situation. He\nnever knew a watch made by the principle of order; nor can he even form to himself an idea of what is\nmeant by a principle of order, distinct from the intelligence of the watch-maker.\nVI. Sixthly, he would be surprised to hear that the mechanism of the watch was no proof of contrivance,\nonly a motive to induce the mind to think so:\n17 Paley\u2019s Watchmaker Argument 91 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nVII. And not less surprised to be informed, that the watch in his hand was nothing more than the result\nof the laws of metallicnature. It is a perversion of language to assign any law, as the efficient, operative\ncause of any thing. A law presupposes an agent; for it is only the mode, according to which an agent\nproceeds: it implies a power; for it is the order, according to which that power acts. Without this agent,\nwithout this power, which are both distinct from itself, the law does nothing; is nothing. The expression,\n\"the law of metallic nature,\" may sound strange and harsh to a philosophic ear; but it seems quite as\njustifiable as some others which are more familiar to him, such as \"the law of vegetable nature,\" \"the law\nof animal nature,\" or indeed as \"the law of nature\" in general, when assigned as the cause of\nph\u00e6nomena, in exclusion of agency and power; or when it is substituted into the place of these.\nVIII. Neither, lastly, would our observer be driven out of his conclusion, or from his confidence in its\ntruth, by being told that he knew nothing at all about the matter. He knows enough for his argument: he\nknows the utility of the end: he knows the subserviency and adaptation of the means to the end. These\npoints being known, his ignorance of other points, his doubts concerning other points, affect not the\ncertainty of his reasoning. The consciousness of knowing little, need not beget a distrust of that which he\ndoes know.\n17 Paley\u2019s Watchmaker Argument 92 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n18\nHume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d\nThe Problem of Evil1\nPART X.\nIt is my opinion, I own, replied Demea, that each man feels, in a manner, the truth of religion within his\nown breast, and, from a consciousness of his imbecility and misery, rather than from any reasoning, is\nled to seek protection from that Being, on whom he and all nature is dependent. So anxious or so tedious\nare even the best scenes of life, that futurity is still the object of all our hopes and fears. We incessantly\nlook forward, and endeavour, by prayers, adoration, and sacrifice, to appease those unknown powers,\nwhom we find, by experience, so able to afflict and oppress us. Wretched creatures that we are! what\nresource for us amidst the innumerable ills of life, did not religion suggest some methods of atonement,\nand appease those terrors with which we are incessantly agitated and tormented?\nI am indeed persuaded, said Philo, that the best, and indeed the only method of bringing every one to a\ndue sense of religion, is by just representations of the misery and wickedness of men. And for that\npurpose a talent of eloquence and strong imagery is more requisite than that of reasoning and argument.\nFor is it necessary to prove what every one feels within himself? It is only necessary to make us feel it, if\npossible, more intimately and sensibly.\nThe people, indeed, replied Demea, are sufficiently convinced of this great and melancholy truth. The\nmiseries of life; the unhappiness of man; the general corruptions of our nature; the unsatisfactory\nenjoyment of pleasures, riches, honours; these phrases have become almost proverbial in all languages.\nAnd who can doubt of what all men declare from their own immediate feeling and experience?\nIn this point, said Philo, the learned are perfectly agreed with the vulgar; and in all letters, sacred and\nprofane, the topic of human misery has been insisted on with the most pathetic eloquence that sorrow\nand melancholy could inspire. The poets, who speak from sentiment, without a system, and whose\ntestimony has therefore the more authority, abound in images of this nature. From Homer down to Dr.\nYoung, the whole inspired tribe have ever been sensible, that no other representation of things would\nsuit the feeling and observation of each individual.\nAs to authorities, replied Demea, you need not seek them. Look round this library of Cleanthes. I shall\nventure to affirm, that, except authors of particular sciences, such as chemistry or botany, who have no\noccasion to treat of human life, there is scarce one of those innumerable writers, from whom the sense of\nhuman misery has not, in some passage or other, extorted a complaint and confession of it. At least, the\nchance is entirely on that side; and no one author has ever, so far as I can recollect, been so extravagant\nas to deny it.\n1 From Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, by David Hume, 1854\n18 Hume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d 93 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThere you must excuse me, said Philo: Leibnitz has denied it; and is perhaps the first 9 who ventured\nupon so bold and paradoxical an opinion; at least, the first who made it essential to his philosophical\nsystem.\nAnd by being the first, replied Demea, might he not have been sensible of his error? For is this a subject\nin which philosophers can propose to make discoveries especially in so late an age? And can any man\nhope by a simple denial (for the subject scarcely admits of reasoning), to bear down the united testimony\nof mankind, founded on sense and consciousness?\nAnd why should man, added he, pretend to an exemption from the lot of all other animals? The whole\nearth, believe me, Philo, is cursed and polluted. A perpetual war is kindled amongst all living creatures.\nNecessity, hunger, want, stimulate the strong and courageous: fear, anxiety, terror, agitate the weak and\ninfirm. The first entrance into life gives anguish to the new-born infant and to its wretched parent:\nweakness, impotence, distress, attend each stage of that life: and it is at last finished in agony and horror.\nObserve too, says Philo, the curious artifices of Nature, in order to embitter the life of every living\nbeing. The stronger prey upon the weaker, and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety. The weaker\ntoo, in their turn, often prey upon the stronger, and vex and molest them without relaxation. Consider\nthat innumerable race of insects, which either are bred on the body of each animal, or, flying about, infix\ntheir stings in him. These insects have others still less than themselves, which torment them. And thus\non each hand, before and behind, above and below, every animal is surrounded with enemies, which\nincessantly seek his misery and distruction.\nMan alone, said Demea, seems to be, in part, an exception to this rule. For by combination in society, he\ncan easily master lions, tigers, and bears, whose greater strength and agility naturally enable them to\nprey upon him.\nOn the contrary, it is here chiefly, cried Philo, that the uniform and equal maxims of Nature are most\napparent. Man, it is true, can, by combination, surmount all his real enemies, and become master of the\nwhole animal creation: but does he not immediately raise up to himself imaginary enemies, the demons\nof his fancy, who haunt him with superstitious terrors, and blast every enjoyment of life? His pleasure,\nas he imagines, becomes, in their eyes, a crime: his food and repose give them umbrage and offence: his\nvery sleep and dreams furnish new materials to anxious fear: and even death, his refuge from every other\nill, presents only the dread of endless and innumerable woes. Nor does the wolf molest more the timid\nflock, than superstition does the anxious breast of wretched mortals.\nBesides, consider, Demea: this very society, by which we surmount those wild beasts, our natural\nenemies; what new enemies does it not raise to us? What woe and misery does it not occasion? Man is\nthe greatest enemy of man. Oppression, injustice, contempt, contumely, violence, sedition, war,\ncalumny, treachery, fraud; by these they mutually torment each other; and they would soon dissolve that\nsociety which they had formed, were it not for the dread of still greater ills, which must attend their\nseparation.\nBut though these external insults, said Demea, from animals, from men, from all the elements, which\nassault us, form a frightful catalogue of woes, they are nothing in comparison of those which arise\n18 Hume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d 94 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nwithin ourselves, from the distempered condition of our mind and body. How many lie under the\nlingering torment of diseases? Hear the pathetic enumeration of the great poet.\nIntestine stone and ulcer, colic-pangs,\nDemoniac frenzy, moping melancholy,\nAnd moon-struck madness, pining atrohy,\nMarasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence.\nDire was the tossing, deep the groans: DESPAIR\nTended the sick, busiest from couch to couch.\nAnd over them triumphant DEATH his dart\nShook: but delay'd to strike, though oft invok'd\nWith vows, as their chief good and final hope.\nThe disorders of the mind, continued Demea, though more secret, are not perhaps less dismal and\nvexatious. Remorse, shame, anguish, rage, disappointment, anxiety, fear, dejection, despair; who has\never passed through life without cruel inroads from these tormentors? How many have scarcely ever felt\nany better sensations? Labour and poverty, so abhorred by every one, are the certain lot of the far greater\nnumber; and those few privileged persons, who enjoy ease and opulence, never reach contentment or\ntrue felicity. All the goods of life united would not make a very happy man; but all the ills united would\nmake a wretch indeed; and any one of them almost (and who can be free from every one?) nay often the\nabsence of one good (and who can possess all?) is sufficient to render life ineligible.\nWere a stranger to drop on a sudden into this world, I would shew him, as a specimen of its ills, an\nhospital full of diseases, a prison crowded with malefactors and debtors, a field of battle strewed with\ncarcases, a fleet foundering in the ocean, a nation languishing under tyranny, famine, or pestilence. To\nturn the gay side of life to him and give him a notion of its pleasures; whither should I conduct him? to a\nball, to an opera, to court? He might justly think, that I was only shewing him a diversity of distress and\nsorrow.\nThere is no evading such striking instances, said Philo, but by apologies, which still further aggravate\nthe charge. Why have all men, I ask, in all ages, complained incessantly of the miseries of life? . . . .\nThey have no just reason, says one: these complaints proceed only from their discontented, repining,\nanxious disposition . . . . And can there possibly, I reply, be a more certain foundation of misery, than\nsuch a wretched temper?\nBut if they were really as unhappy as they pretend, says my antagonist, why do they remain in life? . . . .\nNot satisfied with life, afraid of death.\n18 Hume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d 95 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThis is the secret chain, say I, that holds us. We are terrified, not bribed to the continuance of our\nexistence.\nIt is only a false delicacy, he may insist, which a few refined spirits indulge, and which has spread these\ncomplaints among the whole race of mankind. . . . And what is this delicacy, I ask, which you blame? Is\nit any thing but a greater sensibility to all the pleasures and pains of life? and if the man of a delicate,\nrefined temper, by being so much more alive than the rest of the world, is only so much more unhappy,\nwhat judgment must we form in general of human life?\nLet men remain at rest, says our adversary, and they will be easy. They are willing artificers of their own\nmisery. . . . No! reply I: an anxious languor follows their repose; disappointment, vexation, trouble, their\nactivity and ambition.\nI can observe something like what you mention in some others, replied Cleanthes: but I confess I feel\nlittle or nothing of it in myself, and hope that it is not so common as you represent it.\nIf you feel not human misery yourself, cried Demea, I congratulate you on so happy a singularity.\nOthers, seemingly the most prosperous, have not been ashamed to vent their complaints in the most\nmelancholy strains. Let us attend to the great, the fortunate emperor, Charles V., when, tired with human\ngrandeur, he resigned all his extensive dominions into the hands of his son. In the last harangue which\nhe made on that memorable occasion, he publicly avowed, that the greatest prosperities which he had\never enjoyed, had been mixed with so many adversities, that he might truly say he had never enjoyed\nany satisfaction or contentment. But did the retired life, in which he sought for shelter, afford him any\ngreater happiness? If we may credit his son's account, his repentance commenced the very day of his\nresignation.\nCicero's fortune, from small beginnings, rose to the greatest lustre and renown; yet what pathetic\ncomplaints of the ills of life do his familiar letters, as well as philosophical discourses, contain? And\nsuitably to his own experience, he introduces Cato, the great, the fortunate Cato, protesting in his old\nage, that had he a new life in his offer, he would reject the present.\nAsk yourself, ask any of your acquaintance, whether they would live over again the last ten or twenty\nyears of their lives. No! but the next twenty, they say, will be better:\nAnd from the dregs of life, hope to receive\nWhat the first sprightly running could not give0.\nThus at last they find (such is the greatness of human misery, it reconciles even contradictions), that they\ncomplain at once of the shortness of life, and of its vanity and sorrow.\nAnd is it possible, Cleanthes, said Philo, that after all these reflections, and infinitely more, which might\nbe suggested, you can still persevere in your Anthropomorphism, and assert the moral attributes of the\nDeity, his justice, benevolence, mercy, and rectitude, to be of the same nature with these virtues in\nhuman creatures? His power we allow is infinite: whatever he wills is executed: but neither man nor any\nother animal is happy: therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: he is never\nmistaken in choosing the means to any end: but the course of Nature tends not to human or animal\n18 Hume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d 96 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nfelicity: therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human\nknowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his\nbenevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?\nEpicurus's old questions are yet unanswered.\nIs he willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he\nmalevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?\nYou ascribe, Cleanthes (and I believe justly), a purpose and intention to Nature. But what, I beseech\nyou, is the object of that curious artifice and machinery, which she has displayed in all animals? The\npreservation alone of individuals, and propagation of the species. It seems enough for her purpose, if\nsuch a rank be barely upheld in the universe, without any care or concern for the happiness of the\nmembers that compose it. No resource for this purpose: no machinery, in order merely to give pleasure\nor ease: no fund of pure joy and contentment: no indulgence, without some want or necessity\naccompanying it. At least, the few phenomena of this nature are overbalanced by opposite phenomena of\nstill greater importance.\nOur sense of music, harmony, and indeed beauty of all kinds, gives satisfaction, without being\nabsolutely necessary to the preservation and propagation of the species. But what racking pains, on the\nother hand, arise from gouts, gravels, megrims, toothaches, rheumatisms, where the injury to the animal\nmachinery is either small or incurable? Mirth, laughter, play, frolic, seems gratuitous satisfactions,\nwhich have no further tendency: spleen, melancholy, discontent, superstition, are pains of the same\nnature. How then does the Divine benevolence display itself, in the sense of you Anthropomorphites?\nNone but we Mystics, as you were pleased to call us, can account for this strange mixture of phenomena,\nby deriving it from attributes, infinitely perfect, but incomprehensible.\nAnd have you at last, said Cleanthes, smiling, betrayed your intentions, Philo? Your long agreement\nwith Demea did indeed a little surprize me; but I find you were all the while erecting a concealed battery\nagainst me. And I must confess, that you have now fallen upon a subject worthy of your noble spirit of\nopposition and controversy. If you can make out the present point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or\ncorrupted, there is an end at once of all religion. For to what purpose establish the natural attributes of\nthe Deity, while the moral are still doubtful and uncertain?\nYou take umbrage very easily, replied Demea, at opinions the most innocent, and the most generally\nreceived, even amongst the religious and devout themselves: and nothing can be more surprising than to\nfind a topic like this, concerning the wickedness and misery of man, charged with no less than Atheism\nand profaneness. Have not all pious divines and preachers, who have indulged their rhetoric on so fertile\na subject; have they not easily, I say, given a solution of any difficulties which may attend it? This world\nis but a point in comparison of the universe; this life but a moment in comparison of eternity. The\npresent evil phenomena, therefore, are rectified in other regions, and in some future period of existence.\nAnd the eyes of men, being then opened to larger views of things, see the whole connexion of general\nlaws; and trace with adoration, the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity, through all the mazes and\nintricacies of his providence.\n18 Hume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d 97 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nNo! replied Cleanthes, No! These arbitrary suppositions can never be admitted, contrary to matter of\nfact, visible and uncontroverted. Whence can any cause be known but from its known effects? Whence\ncan any hypothesis be proved but from the apparent phenomena? To establish one hypothesis upon\nanother, is building entirely in the air; and the utmost we ever attain, by these conjectures and fictions, is\nto ascertain the bare possibility of our opinion; but never can we, upon such terms, establish its reality.\nThe only method of supporting Divine benevolence, and it is what I willingly embrace, is to deny\nabsolutely the misery and wickedness of man. Your representations are exaggerated; your melancholy\nviews mostly fictitious; your inferences contrary to fact and experience. Health is more common than\nsickness; pleasure than pain; happiness than misery. And for one vexation which we meet with, we\nattain, upon computation, a hundred enjoyments.\nAdmitting your position, replied Philo, which yet is extremely doubtful, you must at the same time\nallow, that if pain be less frequent than pleasure, it is infinitely more violent and durable. One hour of it\nis often able to outweigh a day, a week, a month of our common insipid enjoyments; and how many\ndays, weeks, and months, are passed by several in the most acute torments? Pleasure, scarcely in one\ninstance, is ever able to reach ecstasy and rapture; and in no one instance can it continue for any time at\nits highest pitch and altitude. The spirits evaporate, the nerves relax, the fabric is disordered, and the\nenjoyment quickly degenerates into fatigue and uneasiness. But pain often, good God, how often! rises\nto torture and agony; and the longer it continues, it becomes still more genuine agony and torture.\nPatience is exhausted, courage languishes, melancholy seizes us, and nothing terminates our misery but\nthe removal of its cause, or another event, which is the sole cure of all evil, but which, from our natural\nfolly, we regard with still greater horror and consternation.\nBut not to insist upon these topics, continued Philo, though most obvious, certain, and important; I must\nuse the freedom to admonish you, Cleanthes, that you have put the controversy upon a most dangerous\nissue, and are unawares introducing a total scepticism into the most essential articles of natural and\nrevealed theology. What! no method of fixing a just foundation for religion, unless we allow the\nhappiness of human life, and maintain a continued existence even in this world, with all our present\npains, infirmities, vexations, and follies, to be eligible and desirable! But this is contrary to every one's\nfeeling and experience: it is contrary to an authority so established as nothing can subvert. No decisive\nproofs can ever be produced against this authority; nor is it possible for you to compute, estimate, and\ncompare, all the pains and all the pleasures in the lives of all men and of all animals: and thus, by your\nresting the whole system of religion on a point, which, from its very nature, must for ever be uncertain,\nyou tacitly confess, that that system is equally uncertain.\nBut allowing you what never will be believed, at least what you never possibly can prove, that animal,\nor at least human happiness, in this life, exceeds its misery, you have yet done nothing: for this is not, by\nany means, what we expect from infinite power, infinite wisdom, and infinite goodness. Why is there\nany misery at all in the world? Not by chance surely. From some cause then. Is it from the intention of\nthe Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it contrary to his intention? But he is almighty. Nothing can\nshake the solidity of this reasoning, so short, so clear, so decisive; except we assert, that these subjects\nexceed all human capacity, and that our common measures of truth and falsehood are not applicable to\nthem; a topic which I have all along insisted on, but which you have, from the beginning, rejected with\nscorn and indignation.\n18 Hume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d 98 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nBut I will be contented to retire still from this intrenchment, for I deny that you can ever force me in it. I\nwill allow, that pain or misery in man is compatible with infinite power and goodness in the Deity, even\nin your sense of these attributes: what are you advanced by all these concessions? A mere possible\ncompatibility is not sufficient. You must prove these pure, unmixed, and uncontrollable attributes from\nthe present mixed and confused phenomena, and from these alone. A hopeful undertaking! Were the\nphenomena ever so pure and unmixed, yet being finite, they would be insufficient for that purpose. How\nmuch more, where they are also so jarring and discordant!\nHere, Cleanthes, I find myself at ease in my argument. Here I triumph. Formerly, when we argued\nconcerning the natural attributes of intelligence and design, I needed all my sceptical and metaphysical\nsubtilty to elude your grasp. In many views of the universe and of its parts, particularly the latter, the\nbeauty and fitness of final causes strike us with such irresistible force, that all objections appear (what I\nbelieve they really are) mere cavils and sophisms; nor can we then imagine how it was ever possible for\nus to repose any weight on them. But there is no view of human life, or of the condition of mankind,\nfrom which, without the greatest violence, we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that infinite\nbenevolence, conjoined with infinite power and infinite wisdom, which we must discover by the eyes of\nfaith alone. It is your turn now to tug the laboring oar, and to support your philosophical subtilties\nagainst the dictates of plain reason and experience.\n18 Hume and \u201cThe Problem of Evil\u201d 99 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nUNIT FOUR: FREE WILL, DETERMINISM, AND\nRESPONSIBILITY1\nFree will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action. It is closely linked to the\nconcepts of responsibility, praise, guilt, sin, and other judgments which apply only to actions that are\nfreely chosen. It is also connected with the concepts of advice, persuasion, deliberation, and prohibition.\nTraditionally, only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are\nnumerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is\nconceived, which is a matter of some debate.\nSome conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been\ndetermined by past events. Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is\ninconsistent with the existence of such free will. This problem has been identified in ancient Greek\nphilosophy, and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be\nincompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism, and encompasses both metaphysical\nlibertarianism, the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and hard\ndeterminism, the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses\nhard incompatibilism, which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with\nfree will, and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.\nIn contrast, compatibilists hold that free will is compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even\nhold that determinism is necessary for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course\nof action over another, requiring a sense of how choices will turn out. Compatibilists thus consider the\ndebate between libertarians and hard determinists over free will vs determinism a false dilemma.\nDifferent compatibilists offer very different definitions of what \"free will\" even means, and\nconsequently find different types of constraints to be relevant to the issue. Classical compatibilists\nconsidered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, had one\ncounterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one could have done otherwise without physical impediment.\nContemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct\none's behavior in a way responsive to reason. And there are still further different conceptions of free\nwill, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of\ndeterminism a threat to the possibility of free will.\nIn Western philosophy\nThe underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control,\nand to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek stoics (for example, Chrysippus), and some\nmodern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these millennia.\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

The\nconflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either causal closure or physical\ndeterminism (nomological determinism) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause\noutside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by\npreceding events (cause and effect).\nThe puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the problem of free will or\nsometimes referred to as the dilemma of determinism. This dilemma leads to a moral dilemma as well:\nHow are we to assign responsibility for our actions if they are caused entirely by past events?\nCompatibilists maintain that mental reality is not of itself causally effective. Classical compatibilists\nhave addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds as long as we are not externally\nconstrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists make a distinction between freedom of will and freedom\nof action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all\nexperience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this\nintuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.\nA different approach to the dilemma is that of incompatibilists, namely, that if the world is deterministic\nthen, our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an illusion. Metaphysical libertarianism is\nthe form of incompatibilism which posits that determinism is false and free will is possible (at least\nsome people have free will). This view is associated with non-materialist constructions, including both\ntraditional dualism, as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to\nconsciously veto an action or competing desire. Yet even with physical indeterminism, arguments have\nbeen made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign Origination (responsibility for \"free\"\nindeterministic choices).\nFree will here is predominately treated with respect to physical determinism in the strict sense of\nnomological determinism, although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will. For\nexample, logical and theological determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of\ndestiny and fate, and biological, cultural and psychological determinism feed the development of\ncompatibilist models. Separate classes of compatibilism and incompatibilism may even be formed to\nrepresent these.\nBelow are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.\nIncompatibilism\nIncompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the\nmajor question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are\ndetermined. \"Hard determinists\", such as d'Holbach, are those incompatibilists who accept determinism\nand reject free will. In contrast, \"metaphysical libertarians\", such as Thomas Reid, Peter van Inwagen,\nand Robert Kane, are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the\nUNIT FOUR: FREE WILL, DETERMINISM, AND RESPONSIBILITY 101 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nview that some form of indeterminism is true. Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state\nthat free will is incompatible with both determinism and indeterminism.\nTraditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an \"intuition pump\": if a person is like other\nmechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet,\nor a robot, then people must not have free will. This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such\nas Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it\nremains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.\nAnother argument for incompatibilism is that of the \"causal chain\". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist\ntheory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in\n\"voluntary\" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the \"ultimate\" or\n\"originating\" cause of his actions. He must be causa sui, in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for\none's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause\nof that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his\nactions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his\ncontrol. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be\nthe ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will. This argument has also been\nchallenged by various compatibilist philosophers.\nUNIT FOUR: FREE WILL, DETERMINISM, AND RESPONSIBILITY 102 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n19\nThe Turing Test\n\u201cAlan Turing\u201d1\nAlan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/\u02c8tj\u028a\u0259r\u026a\u014b/; 23 June 1912 \u2013 7 June 1954) was an English computer\nscientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the\ndevelopment of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and\ncomputation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.\nTuring is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.\nDuring the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)\nat Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he led Hut 8, the section responsible for\nGerman naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German\nciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine\nthat could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted\ncoded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the\nBattle of the Atlantic; it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two\nyears and saved over fourteen million lives.\nAfter the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the ACE, among the\nfirst designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine\nLaboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester\ncomputers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of\nmorphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction,\nfirst observed in the 1960s.\nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere Amendment, \"gross\nindecency\" was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an\nalternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An\ninquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent\nwith accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon\nBrown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he\nwas treated.\" Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

The quotes from Turing\nbelow that are combined with my commentary are from this article.\nThe first section of Turing\u2019s article is labeled \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201d The recent biopic abut Turing\n(2014, Directed by Morten Tyldum) uses this as its title, making use both of Turing\u2019s own most popular\ncontribution to Philosophy and the fact that Turing had a lot of difficulties fitting socially, so that he had\nto \u201cimitate\u201d being a normal person. It\u2019s worth a watch if you have the time. In this first section of the\narticle, Turing outlines what his project is going to be, and he makes it very clear what he wants to argue\nfor, and what he does not want to argue for,\n\u201cI propose to consider the question, \"Can machines think?\" This should begin with definitions of\nthe meaning of the terms \"machine\" and \"think.\" The definitions might be framed so as to reflect\nso far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of\nthe words \"machine\" and \"think\" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is\ndifficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, \"Can\nmachines think?\" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd.\nInstead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely\nrelated to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\nThe new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation\ngame.\" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may\nbe of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object of the\ngame for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the\nwoman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either \"X is A and\nY is B\" or \"X is B and Y is A.\"\u201d\nThe form that the test will take is rather easy to understand given today\u2019s technologies, but Turing had to\ngo to great lengths to basically just describe the judge communicating with the two through electronic\nform, like a chat room, instant messaging, or texting. Communicating this way ensures that only the\ncontent of what is said is considered when making a decision. He then says,\n\u201cWe now ask the question, \"What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\"\nWill the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when\nthe game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, \"Can\nmachines think?\"\u201d\nSo what he wants to do is rather simple: a judge (you, for example) chats with 2 beings through a\ncomputer. One is a computer and the other is a person. They both try to convince you that they are the\nperson, and if you can\u2019t decide which is which or guess wrong \u2013 and this happens repeatedly to both\n2 Mind, (1950) LIX (236): 433-460\n19 The Turing Test 104 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nyourself and others \u2013 then Turing believes we ought to conclude that the computer is intelligent like we\nare since it has properly imitated us (hence calling it the \u201cimitation game\u201d).\nTuring then goes on to explain the advantages of approaching machine intelligence this way as opposed\nto trying to define thinking and showing that a machine can do it,\n\u201cThe new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical and the\nintellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist claims to be able to produce a material\nwhich is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at some time this might be\ndone, but even supposing this invention available we should feel there was little point in trying to\nmake a \"thinking machine\" more human by dressing it up in such artificial flesh. The form in\nwhich we have set the problem reflects this fact in the condition which prevents the interrogator\nfrom seeing or touching the other competitors, or hearing -their voices\u2026\nWe do not wish to penalise the machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to\npenalise a man for losing in a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these\ndisabilities irrelevant. The \"witnesses\" can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they\nplease about their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot demand practical\ndemonstrations\u2026.\nIt might be urged that when playing the \"imitation game\" the best strategy for the machine may\npossibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man. This may be, but I think it\nis unlikely that there is any great effect of this kind. In any case there is no intention to\ninvestigate here the theory of the game, and it will be assumed that the best strategy is to try to\nprovide answers that would naturally be given by a man.\u201d\nWhy approach artificial intelligence in this way? It\u2019s rather simple: how do we know other people are\nintelligent? Do we define \u201cthinking\u201d and then say \u201cI know that you are thinking and thus can be\nintelligent\u201d? Or do we just assume others are intelligent if we interact with them and they show they are\nintelligent? Turing just wants to extend this courtesy that we extend to other people to machines as well.\nAfter presenting his reasons for believing the test to be a good one, Turing goes on to deal with many\ncounter arguments to his own. This is a solid philosophical move and is his attempt to deal with all of\nthe most reasonable and common objections to what he has proposed. He dealt with a number of\ntechnological issues which we can now take for granted: there are few who doubt that artificial\nintelligence will happen some time, and now it appears to just be a matter of when and how. Computers\nadvance in power every year, so some real form of artificial intelligence beyond Siri-like helpers is on\nthe distant horizon. He does deal with other, more timeless objections as well, and those follow below.\nThe Mathematical Objection\nDespite the advances in technology, it is still possible that computers will never be capable of computing\neverything necessary to mimic or have human intelligence. He summarizes these objections as follows,\n\u201cThe result in question refers to a type of machine which is essentially a digital computer with an\ninfinite capacity. It states that there are certain things that such a machine cannot do. If it is\n19 The Turing Test 105 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nrigged up to give answers to questions as in the imitation game, there will be some questions to\nwhich it will either give a wrong answer, or fail to give an answer at all however much time is\nallowed for a reply. There may, of course, be many such questions, and questions which cannot\nbe answered by one machine may be satisfactorily answered by another. We are of course\nsupposing for the present that the questions are of the kind to which an answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" is\nappropriate, rather than questions such as \"What do you think of Picasso?\" The questions that we\nknow the machines must fail on are of this type\u2026This is the mathematical result: it is argued that\nit proves a disability of machines to which the human intellect is not subject.\u201d\nHis response to this is rather simple: So what? How do you know that people aren\u2019t limited? And even if\na computer has limitations, does it really matter? His response is below and it finishes with his most\nimportant point for the purposes of the usefulness of the Imitation Game,\n\u201cThe short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are limitations to\nthe Powers If any particular machine, it has only been stated, without any sort of proof, that no\nsuch limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not think this view can be dismissed quite\nso lightly. Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a\ndefinite answer, we know that this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of\nsuperiority. Is this feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much\nimportance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions ourselves to\nbe justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the part of the machines.\nFurther, our superiority can only be felt on such an occasion in relation to the one machine over\nwhich we have scored our petty triumph. There would be no question of triumphing\nsimultaneously over all machines. In short, then, there might be men cleverer than any given\nmachine, but then again there might be other machines cleverer again, and so on.\nThose who hold to the mathematical argument would, I think, mostly he willing to accept the\nimitation game as a basis for discussion\u2026\u201d\nSo, even if there is something to this argument, the Imitation Game itself can still function as a test for\nintelligence.\nThe Argument from Consciousness\nThis argument is one of the more interesting and strongest ones that still stands today against the\npossibility of a true Artificial Intelligence akin to our own, human intelligence. Turing explains this\nargument as follows,\n\u201cThis argument is very, well expressed in Professor Jefferson's Lister Oration for 1949, from\nwhich I quote. \"Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of\nthoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine\nequals brain-that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel\n(and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grief when its\nvalves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be\nangry or depressed when it cannot get what it wants.\"\u201d\n19 The Turing Test 106 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThis objection calls into the question validity of the Imitation Game test and essentially says, \u201cEven if it\npasses the test, it\u2019s not intelligent because it lacks consciousness or the ability to do something new and\nemotional.\u201d Turing responds by asking whether or not we really know that others are thinking (or even\nourselves). He has a point here since what constitutes \u201cconsciousness\u201d and \u201cthinking\u201d is still mostly a\nmystery. We know how brains work during those processes, but we can\u2019t exactly define them yet, hence\nwhy Turing likes his test as the method of determining intelligence.\nTuring goes on to say that the real force of the argument is that it calls into question a machines ability\nto understand anything like a human does. John Searle\u2019s \u201cChinese Room\u201d argument that follows below\nis a stronger presentation of this argument, and Turing gives his own response to these objections by\nsaying that a machine could certainly behave as if it has understanding, and whether or not that\nunderstanding would be \u201cgenuine\u201d is a separate issue; the test of the Imitation Game for intelligence can\nstill work, especially since it\u2019s how we know that other people understand things.\nArguments from Various Disabilities\nTuring summarizes this objection as follows,\n\u201cThese arguments take the form, \"I grant you that you can make machines do all the things you\nhave mentioned but you will never be able to make one to do X.\" Numerous features X are\nsuggested in this connexion I offer a selection:\nBe kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from\nwrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make some one fall in love\nwith it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as\nmuch diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.\u201d\nTuring\u2019s response is surprisingly simple: So what if they can\u2019t do these things since they could still be\nintelligent without having to do these things, and more importantly, couldn\u2019t we just make the machine\ndo these things? Can\u2019t we make a computer make mistakes, learn, behave in a certain way, have taste\nbuds, self-program, etc.? And if it\u2019s not funny, is not human then? While I would like to call those\nwithout a sense of humor inhuman, I won\u2019t. They\u2019re just boring, and computers can certainly be boring.\nFinally, Turing drives home his main point yet again: none of this calls into question the appropriateness\nof his test in determining when a machine has achieved intelligence.\nLady Lovelace's Objection\nThis is perhaps one of the more cited objections to computer intelligence, and predates Turing by over a\nhundred years. He portrays it, and his response, as follows,\n\u201cOur most detailed information of Babbage's Analytical Engine comes from a memoir by Lady\nLovelace (1842). In it she states, \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate\nanything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform\" (her italics). This statement is\nquoted by Hartree (1949) who adds: \"This does not imply that it may not be possible to construct\nelectronic equipment which will 'think for itself,' or in which, in biological terms, one could set\n19 The Turing Test 107 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nup a conditioned reflex, which would serve as a basis for 'learning.' Whether this is possible in\nprinciple or not is a stimulating and exciting question, suggested by some of these recent\ndevelopments But it did not seem that the machines constructed or projected at the time had this\nproperty.\"\nI am in thorough agreement with Hartree over this. It will be noticed that he does not assert that\nthe machines in question had not got the property, but rather that the evidence available to Lady\nLovelace did not encourage her to believe that they had it. It is quite possible that the machines\nin question had in a sense got this property. For suppose that some discrete-state machine has the\nproperty. The Analytical Engine was a universal digital computer, so that, if its storage capacity\nand speed were adequate, it could by suitable programming be made to mimic the machine in\nquestion. Probably this argument did not occur to the Countess or to Babbage. In any case there\nwas no obligation on them to claim all that could be claimed\u2026\nA variant of Lady Lovelace's objection states that a machine can \"never do anything really new.\"\nThis may be parried for a moment with the saw, \"There is nothing new under the sun.\" Who can\nbe certain that \"original work\" that he has done was not simply the growth of the seed planted in\nhim by teaching, or the effect of following well-known general principles.\u201d\nAgain, to come back to Turing\u2019s main point, this doesn\u2019t seem to create a genuine problem for his test.\nWhether or not a machine \u2013 or anyone \u2013 can do anything new is a separate question than whether\nsomething is intelligent.\nArgument from Continuity in the Nervous System\nThis objection to Turing is a more technical one, and he explains it like this,\n\u201cThe nervous system is certainly not a discrete-state machine. A small error in the information\nabout the size of a nervous impulse impinging on a neuron, may make a large difference to the\nsize of the outgoing impulse. It may be argued that, this being so, one cannot expect to be able to\nmimic the behaviour of the nervous system with a discrete-state system.\u201d\nThis is an early version of the distinction between what is now known as \u201chard AI\u201d versus \u201csoft AI\u201d.\nHard AI is the type of intelligence that Turing has been talking about: a computer, as we understand\nthem, runs a program that is intelligent. This objection he is discussing basically says that there is no\nway this can work since a computer is, in some sense, binary (just using 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s to do everything)\nand the human brain and mind work in an entirely different way. This problem is still being discussed,\nsince we just don\u2019t know whether or not our brains do function like a very complex personal computer\nor not.\nBecause there is still something to this objection, there are those that are going for what is known as\n\u201csoft AI\u201d where, instead of creating a traditional program on a traditional computer, the goal is to create\nan artificial mechanical brain that completely replicates our own brain in every way. Rather than having\na program be intelligent, the idea is that the resultant thing would be intelligent since it would be, piece\nfor piece, an exact (but artificial) replica of the human brain. Many people think this is the only way to\n19 The Turing Test 108 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nget a real AI and people are laying the foundation to try to create an \u201cartificial\u201d brain that can think for\nitself and mimic the human mind. Time will give us the answer to whether or not this works.\n\u201cThe Chinese Room\u201d3\nThe Chinese room argument holds that a program cannot give a computer a \"mind\", \"understanding\"\nor \"consciousness\", regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer\nbehave. The argument was first presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, \"Minds, Brains, and\nPrograms\", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the\nyears since. The centerpiece of the argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.\nThe argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism,\nwhich hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal\nsymbols. Specifically, the argument refutes a position Searle calls Strong AI:\nThe appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a\nmind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\nAlthough it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI)\nresearchers, it is not an argument against the goals of AI research, because it does not limit the amount\nof intelligence a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs\nand does not apply to machines in general.\nThe Chinese Room Thought Experiment\nSearle's thought experiment begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence\nresearch has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes\nChinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other\nChinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its\ntask so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker\nthat the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes\nappropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to\nanother Chinese-speaking human being.\nThe question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine literally \"understand\" Chinese? Or is it\nmerely simulating the ability to understand Chinese? Searle calls the first position \"strong AI\" and the\nlatter \"weak AI\".\nSearle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer\nprogram, along with sufficient paper, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese\ncharacters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce\n3 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle,\nthat he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.\nSearle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the\nexperiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then\ninterpreted as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle would not be able to understand\nthe conversation. (\"I don't speak a word of Chinese,\" he points out.) Therefore, he argues, it follows that\nthe computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.\nSearle argues that, without \"understanding\" (or \"intentionality\"), we cannot describe what the machine is\ndoing as \"thinking\" and, since it does not think, it does not have a \"mind\" in anything like the normal\nsense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that \"strong AI\" is false.\nThe Turing Test\nThe Chinese room implements a version of the Turing test. Alan Turing introduced the test in 1950 to\nhelp answer the question \"can machines think?\" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a\nnatural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance\nindistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the\njudge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\nTuring then considered each possible objection to the proposal \"machines can think\", and found that\nthere are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however,\nintend for the test to measure for the presence of \"consciousness\" or \"understanding\". He did not believe\nthis was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:\nI do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There\nis, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not\nthink these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with\nwhich we are concerned in this paper.\nTo Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of mind and consciousness, these are the relevant\nmysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the\npresence of consciousness, even if the room can behave or function as a conscious mind would.\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s like to be a Bat\u201d4\nThe Philosopher Thomas Nagel devised a thought experiment which I believe can act as an interesting\nresponse to Searle\u2019s Chinese Room argument. Searle does have a very strong and interesting point about\nunderstanding, but he doesn\u2019t show that there is no understanding taking place \u2013 just that it won\u2019t be the\nsame type of understanding we (normal, conscious humans) believe that we have. Nagel asks us to try to\nunderstand what it would be like to be a bat, and concludes that we could not possibly begin to grasp\n4 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

If you take what he says and apply it to the Chinese Room, then\ncouldn\u2019t a computer have its own type of non-human understanding that we can\u2019t comprehend? I have\nincluded a summary of his arguments below, and it is very technical, but hopefully it makes sense.\n\"What is it like to be a bat?\" is a paper by American philosopher Thomas Nagel, first published in The\nPhilosophical Review in October 1974, and later in Nagel's Mortal Questions (1979). In it, Nagel argues\nthat materialist theories of mind omit the essential component of consciousness, namely that there is\nsomething that it is (or feels) like to be a particular, conscious thing. He argued that an organism had\nconscious mental states, \"if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism\u2014something\nit is like for the organism.\" Daniel Dennett called Nagel's example \"The most widely cited and\ninfluential thought experiment about consciousness.\"\nThe thesis attempts to refute reductionism (the philosophical position that a complex system is nothing\nmore than the sum of its parts). For example, a physicalist reductionist's approach to the mind\u2013body\nproblem holds that the mental process humans experience as consciousness can be fully described via\nphysical processes in the brain and body.\nNagel begins by arguing that the conscious experience is widespread, present in many animals\n(particularly mammals), and that for an organism to have a conscious experience it must be special, in\nthe sense that its qualia or \"subjective character of experience\" are unique. Nagel stated, \u201cAn organism\nhas conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism -\nsomething that it is like for the organism to be itself.\u201d\nThe paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain\nconsciousness via objective, reductionist means. A subjective character of experience cannot be\nexplained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be explained without the\nsubjective character of experience, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a\nreductionist being; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to materialism. Thus for\nconsciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of\nexperience would have to be discarded, which is absurd. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such\na world each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property\nattributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel\nargues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a \u201csingle point of view,\u201d making it\nunfeasible to consider any conscious experience as \u201cobjective\u201d.\nNagel uses the metaphor of bats to clarify the distinction between subjective and objective concepts.\nBats are mammals, so they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel used bats for his argument\nbecause of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly\ndifferent from that of many other organisms. Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects.\nThis method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both sonar and vision are regarded as\nperceptional experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar,\nhang upside down and eat bugs like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that\neven if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired\nas a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat,\nrather than the mindset.\n19 The Turing Test 111 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nSuch is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, \u201cour own\nmental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience\u201d, meaning that each individual only\nknows what it is like to be them (Subjectivism). Objectivity, requires an unbiased, non-subjective state\nof perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to\nsubjective experience.\nNagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect,\nsince that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical,\nbut those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that\nphysicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a\nnecessary precondition for understanding the mind-body problem.\n19 The Turing Test 112 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n20\nDeterminism\n\u201cPhysical Determinism\u201d1\nPhysical determinism generally refers to the assertion of a deterministic physical universe (greater\nphysical system). This holds that a complete description of the physical state of the world at any given\ntime and a complete statement of the physical laws of nature together entail every truth as to what\nphysical events happen after that time. In a scientific context, the term 'event' is somewhat technical,\ndepending upon which theory one is considering, and basically is the occurrence of some 'state' peculiar\nto that theory, for example, a quantum state or a thermodynamic state. Physical determinism includes\n(but is not restricted to) nomological determinism, which holds that all future events are governed by the\npast or present according to all-encompassing deterministic laws.\nThe concept of physical determinism has also been used to denote the predictability of a physical\nsystem, although this usage is uncommon. Physical determinism can also be viewed as an observed\nphenomenon of our experience, or a thesis only relevant to mathematical models of physics and other\nphysical sciences. Physical determinism has also been used as a specific deterministic hypothesis about\nhuman behavior. Although somewhat unrelated to its standard context, physical determinism has also\nbeen used in social engineering theory.\nHistory\nThe notion of physical determinism takes its classical form in the ideas of Laplace, who posited (in\nagreement with the physics of his time) that an omniscient observer (called sometimes Laplace's demon)\nknowing with infinite precision the positions and velocities of every particle in the universe could\npredict the future entirely. Although such an omniscient observer is a hypothetical construct, and infinite\nprecision exceeds the capacities of human measurement, the illustration is presented as a statement of\nwhat in principle would be possible if physical determinism were true, and so reduction to practice is not\nan issue.\nPhysical determinism is currently under heavy debate in modern science. For example, physical\nindeterminism has been proposed to accommodate various interpretations of quantum mechanics.\nSuggestions have also been made to reformulate the conception of determinism with respect to its\napplication to physical law.\nCausal completeness\nPhysical determinism is related to the question of causal completeness of physics, which is synonymous\nwith the weaker form of causal closure. This is the idea that every real event has a scientific explanation,\nthat science need not search for explanations beyond itself. If causal completeness does not apply to\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. Citation: Physical determinism.

For\nexample, a relatively common view of mental events is that they are an epiphenomenon produced as a\nby-product of neurological activity, and without causal impact. In this case, only a failure of\ndeterministic physical law would allow room for their causal significance.\nOther formulations\nA more modern formulation of physical determinism skirts the issue of causal completeness. It is based\nupon connections between 'events' supplied by a theory:\n\"a theory is deterministic if, and only if, given its state variables for some initial period, the\ntheory logically determines a unique set of values for those variables for any other period.\"\n\u2014 Ernest Nagel, Alternative descriptions of physical state p. 292\nThis quote replaces the idea of 'cause-and-effect' with that of 'logical implication' according to one or\nanother theory that connects events. In addition, an 'event' is related by the theory itself to formalized\nstates described using the parameters defined by that theory. Thus, the details of interpretation are\nplaced where they belong, fitted to the context in which the chosen theory applies. Using the definition\nof physical determinism above, the limitations of a theory to some particular domain of experience also\nlimits the associated definition of 'physical determinism' to that same domain.\n\u201cDeterminism\u201d2\nDeterminism is the philosophical position that for every event there exist conditions that could cause no\nother event. \"There are many determinisms, depending on what pre-conditions are considered to be\ndeterminative of an event or action.\" Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have\nsprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. Some forms of\ndeterminism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy of physics. The\nopposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called nondeterminism).\nDeterminism is often contrasted with free will.\nDeterminism often is taken to mean causal determinism, which in physics is known as cause-and-effect.\nIt is the concept that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality in such a way that any state\n(of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from\nother varieties of determinism mentioned below.\nOther debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire\nuniverse is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems\n(or multiverse). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of\ndeterminism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as\ncompatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a\npossibility).\nDeterminism should not be confused with self-determination of human actions by reasons, motives, and\n2 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

Determinism rarely requires that perfect prediction be practically possible.\nVarieties\nBelow are some of the more common viewpoints meant by, or confused with \"determinism\".\n\u2022 Causal determinism is \"the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions\ntogether with the laws of nature\". However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that\n\"one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings\nsomething about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves\ndetermined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence\nor existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way\".\nCausal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the\norigin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe.\nCausal determinists believe that there is nothing in the universe that is uncaused or self-caused.\nHistorical determinism (a sort of path dependence) can also be synonymous with causal determinism.\nCausal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or\nexists is caused by antecedent conditions. In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are\nconsidered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding events\u2014a\ncombination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature. Yet they can also be considered\nmetaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).\n\u2022 Nomological determinism is the most common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that\nthe past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every\noccurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics and various interpretations thereof\npose a serious challenge to this view. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought\nexperiment of Laplace's demon. Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism,\nalthough that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological\ndeterminism (its opposite being physical indeterminism).\n\u2022 Necessitarianism is closely related to the causal determinism described above. It is a\nmetaphysical principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be.\nLeucippus claimed there were no uncaused events, and that everything occurs for a reason and by\nnecessity.\n\u2022 Predeterminism is the idea that all events are determined in advance. The concept of predeterminism\nis often argued by invoking causal determinism, implying that there is an unbroken chain of prior\noccurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of\nevents has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-\nestablished chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in\nwhich case it is categorised as a specific type of determinism. It can also be used interchangeably with\ncausal determinism\u2014in the context of its capacity to determine future events. Despite this,\npredeterminism is often considered as independent of causal determinism. The term predeterminism is\nalso frequently used in the context of biology and hereditary, in which case it represents a form of\nbiological determinism.\n20 Determinism 115 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n\u2022 Fatalism is normally distinguished from \"determinism\" and it is a form of teleological determinism.\nFatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.\nFate has arbitrary power, and need not follow any causal or otherwise deterministic laws. Types of\nFatalism include hard theological determinism and the idea of predestination, where there is a God who\ndetermines all that humans will do. This may be accomplished either by knowing their actions in\nadvance, via some form of omniscience or by decreeing their actions in advance.\n\u2022 Theological determinism is a form of determinism which states that all events that happen are pre-\nordained, or predestined to happen, by a monotheistic deity, or that they are destined to occur given its\nomniscience. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak\ntheological determinism. The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a\ncreator deity dictating all events in history: \"everything that happens has been predestined to happen by\nan omniscient, omnipotent divinity\". The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the\nconcept of divine foreknowledge\u2014\"because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the\nfuture will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed\". There exist\nslight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires\npredestination of all events and outcomes by the divinity (i.e. they do not classify the weaker version as\n'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that\nthe weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all. With respect to free will,\n\"theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true\npropositions including propositions about our future actions\", more minimal criteria designed to\nencapsulate all forms of theological determinism. Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of\ncausal determinism, in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.\n\u2022 Logical determinism or Determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past,\npresent, or future, are either true or false. Note that one can support Causal Determinism without\nnecessarily supporting Logical Determinism and vice versa (depending on one's views on the nature of\ntime, but also randomness). The problem of free will is especially salient now with Logical\nDeterminism: how can choices be free, given that propositions about the future already have a truth\nvalue in the present (i.e. it is already determined as either true or false)? This is referred to as the\nproblem of future contingents.\n\u2022 Often synonymous with Logical Determinism are the ideas behind Spatio-temporal Determinism or\nEternalism: the view of special relativity. J. J. C. Smart, a proponent of this view, uses the term\n\"tenselessness\" to describe the simultaneous existence of past, present, and future. In physics, the \"block\nuniverse\" of Hermann Minkowski and Albert Einstein assumes that time is a fourth dimension (like the\nthree spatial dimensions). In other words, all the other parts of time are real, like the city blocks up and\ndown a street, although the order in which they appear depends on the driver (see Rietdijk\u2013Putnam\nargument).\n\u2022 Adequate determinism is the idea that quantum indeterminacy can be ignored for most macroscopic\nevents. This is because of quantum decoherence. Random quantum events \"average out\" in the limit of\nlarge numbers of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of\nclassical mechanics). Stephen Hawking explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of\nquantum mechanics is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the\npredictions of classical mechanics, which are quite accurate (albeit still not perfectly certain) at larger\n20 Determinism 116 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nscales. Something as large as an animal cell, then, would be \"adequately determined\" (even in light of\nquantum indeterminacy).\n\u2022 The Many-worlds interpretation accepts the linear casual sets of sequential events with adequate\nconsistency yet also suggests constant forking of casual chains creating \"multiple universes\" to account\nfor multiple outcomes from single events. Meaning the casual set of events leading to the present are all\nvalid yet appear as a singular linear time stream within a much broader unseen conic probability field of\nother outcomes that \"split off\" from the locally observed timeline. Under this model causal sets are still\n\"consistent\" yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes. The interpretation side steps the exclusive\nretrospective casual chain problem of \"could not have done otherwise\" by suggesting \"the other outcome\ndoes exist\" in a set of parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred. This theory\nis sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that\nrecursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play. This model is highly contested\nwith multiple objections from the scientific community.\nPhilosophical connections\nWith nature/nurture controversy\nAlthough some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and cognition, others\nframe themselves as an answer to the debate on nature and nurture. They will suggest that one factor\nwill entirely determine behavior. As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions\nof these theories have been widely rejected as a single-cause fallacy.\nIn other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature\nand nurture is entirely predictable. The concept of heritability has been helpful in making this\ndistinction.\nBiological determinism, sometimes called genetic determinism, is the idea that each of human\nbehaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.\nBehaviorism involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes\u2014either environmental\nor reflexive. John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner developed this nurture-focused determinism.\nCultural determinism or social determinism is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we\nare raised determines who we are.\nEnvironmental determinism, also known as climatic or geographical determinism, proposes that the\nphysical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture. Supporters of environmental\ndeterminism often also support Behavioral determinism. Key proponents of this notion have included\nEllen Churchill Semple, Ellsworth Huntington, Thomas Griffith Taylor and possibly Jared Diamond,\nalthough his status as an environmental determinist is debated.\nWith particular factors\nOther 'deterministic' theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in\npredicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future.\nThey need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect\npredictions.\n20 Determinism 117 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nPsychological determinism can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be\nsynonymous with some sort of Psychological egoism. The latter is the view that humans will always act\naccording to their perceived best interest.\nLinguistic determinism claims that our language determines (at least limits) the things we can think and\nsay and thus know. The Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis argues that individuals experience the world based on\nthe grammatical structures they habitually use.\nEconomic determinism is the theory which attributes primacy to the economic structure over politics in\nthe development of human history. It is associated with the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx.\nTechnological determinism is a reductionist theory that presumes that a society's technology drives the\ndevelopment of its social structure and cultural values.\nWith free will\nPhilosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will. Compatibilism refers\nto the view that free will is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three incompatibilist\npositions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The hard incompatibilists hold that both determinism\nand free will do not exist, the libertarianists that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist,\nand the hard determinists that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.\nThe standard argument against free will, according to philosopher J. J. C. Smart focuses on the\nimplications of determinism for 'free will'. However, he suggests free will is denied whether\ndeterminism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are\nassumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random\nand as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.\nIn his book, The Moral Landscape, author and neuroscientist Sam Harris also argues against free will.\nHe offers one thought experiment where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the\nmad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, of a particular human.\nHarris believes that it is no longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has \"free will\". Harris says\nnothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will.\nHarris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious\nmachinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes\n\"This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how\ncan we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?\" adding that \"Whether they are predictable\nor not, we do not cause our causes.\" That is, he believes there is compelling evidence of absence of free\nwill.\nSome research (founded by the John Templeton Foundation) suggested that reducing a person's belief in\nfree will is dangerous, making them less helpful and more aggressive. This could occur because the\nindividual's sense of self-efficacy suffers.\nWith the soul\n20 Determinism 118 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nSome determinists argue that materialism does not present a complete understanding of the universe,\nbecause while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, it ignores the minds or\nsouls of conscious beings.\nA number of positions can be delineated:\n1. Immaterial souls are all that exist (Idealism).\n2. Immaterial souls exist and exert a non-deterministic causal influence on bodies. (Traditional\nfree-will, interactionist dualism).\n3. Immaterial souls exist, but are part of deterministic framework.\n4. Immaterial souls exist, but exert no causal influence, free or determined (epiphenomenalism,\noccasionalism)\n5. Immaterial souls do not exist \u2014 there is no mind-body dichotomy, and there is a Materialistic\nexplanation for intuitions to the contrary.\nWith ethics and morality\nAnother topic of debate is the implication that Determinism has on morality. Hard determinism (a belief\nin determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral\njudgments impossible. Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.\nPhilosopher and incompatibilist Peter van Inwagen introduces this thesis as such:\nArgument that Free Will is Required for Moral Judgments\n1. The moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X implies that you should have done\nsomething else instead\n2. That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you\nto do\n3. That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else\n4. That you could have done something else implies that you have free will\n5. If you don't have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that\nyou shouldn't have done X.\nHowever, a compatibilist might have an issue with Inwagen's process because one can not change the\npast like his arguments center around. A compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might\nposit:\n1. The moral judgment that you should not have done X implies that you can do something else\ninstead\n2. That you can do something else instead implies that there is something else for you to do\n3. That there is something else for you to do implies that you can do something else\n4. That you can do something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse\n5. If you have free will to do other than X we can make the moral judgment that you should do\nother than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you know you\nshould not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.\n20 Determinism 119 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n21\nThe Illusion of Free Will\nThe Illusion of Free Will1\n80. Theologians repeatedly tell us, that man is free, while all their principles conspire to destroy his\nliberty. By endeavouring to justify the Divinity, they in reality accuse him of the blackest injustice. They\nsuppose, that without grace, man is necessitated to do evil. They affirm, that God will punish him,\nbecause God has not given him grace to do good!\nLittle reflection will suffice to convince us, that man is necessitated in all his actions, that his free will is\na chimera, even in the system of theologians. Does it depend upon man to be born of such or such\nparents? Does it depend upon man to imbibe or not to imbibe the opinions of his parents or instructors?\nIf I had been born of idolatrous or Mahometan parents, would it have depended upon me to become a\nChristian? Yet, divines gravely assure us, that a just God will damn without pity all those, to whom he\nhas not given grace to know the Christian religion!\nMan's birth is wholly independent of his choice. He is not asked whether he is willing, or not, to come\ninto the world. Nature does not consult him upon the country and parents she gives him. His acquired\nideas, his opinions, his notions true or false, are necessary fruits of the education which he has received,\nand of which he has not been the director. His passions and desires are necessary consequences of the\ntemperament given him by nature. During his whole life, his volitions and actions are determined by his\nconnections, habits, occupations, pleasures, and conversations; by the thoughts, that are involuntarily\npresented to his mind; in a word, by a multitude of events and accidents, which it is out of his power to\nforesee or prevent. Incapable of looking into futurity, he knows not what he will do. From the instant of\nhis birth to that of his death, he is never free. You will say, that he wills, deliberates, chooses,\ndetermines; and you will hence conclude, that his actions are free. It is true, that man wills, but he is not\nmaster of his will or his desires; he can desire and will only what he judges advantageous to himself; he\ncan neither love pain, nor detest pleasure. It will be said, that he sometimes prefers pain to pleasure; but\nthen he prefers a momentary pain with a view of procuring a greater and more durable pleasure. In this\ncase, the prospect of a greater good necessarily determines him to forego a less considerable good.\nThe lover does not give his mistress the features which captivate him; he is not then master of loving, or\nnot loving the object of his tenderness; he is not master of his imagination or temperament. Whence it\nevidently follows, that man is not master of his volitions and desires. \"But man,\" you will say, \"can\nresist his desires; therefore he is free.\" Man resists his desires, when the motives, which divert him from\nan object, are stronger than those, which incline him towards it; but then his resistance is necessary. A\nman, whose fear of dishonour or punishment is greater than his love of money, necessarily resists the\ndesire of stealing.\n1 From Good Sense by Baron Paul Henri D'Holbach, 1772\n21 The Illusion of Free Will 120 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n\"Are we not free, when we deliberate?\" But, are we masters of knowing or not knowing, of being in\ndoubt or certainty? Deliberation is a necessary effect of our uncertainty respecting the consequences of\nour actions. When we are sure, or think we are sure, of these consequences, we necessarily decide, and\nwe then act necessarily according to our true or false judgment. Our judgments, true or false, are not\nfree; they are necessarily determined by the ideas, we have received, or which our minds have formed.\nMan is not free in his choice; he is evidently necessitated to choose what he judges most useful and\nagreeable. Neither is he free, when he suspends his choice; he is forced to suspend it until he knows, or\nthinks he knows, the qualities of the objects presented to him, or, until he has weighed the consequences\nof his actions. \"Man,\" you will say, \"often decides in favour of actions, which he knows must be\ndetrimental to himself; man sometimes kills himself; therefore he is free.\" I deny it. Is man master of\nreasoning well or ill? Do not his reason and wisdom depend upon the opinions he has formed, or upon\nthe conformation of his machine? As neither one nor the other depends upon his will, they are no proof\nof liberty. \"If I lay a wager, that I shall do, or not do a thing, am I not free? Does it not depend upon me\nto do it or not?\" No, I answer; the desire of winning the wager will necessarily determine you to do, or\nnot to do the thing in question. \"But, supposing I consent to lose the wager?\" Then the desire of proving\nto me, that you are free, will have become a stronger motive than the desire of winning the wager; and\nthis motive will have necessarily determined you to do, or not to do, the thing in question.\n\"But,\" you will say, \"I feel free.\" This is an illusion, that may be compared to that of the fly in the fable,\nwho, lighting upon the pole of a heavy carriage, applauded himself for directing its course. Man, who\nthinks himself free, is a fly, who imagines he has power to move the universe, while he is himself\nunknowingly carried along by it.\nThe inward persuasion that we are free to do, or not to do a thing, is but a mere illusion. If we trace the\ntrue principle of our actions, we shall find, that they are always necessary consequences of our volitions\nand desires, which are never in our power. You think yourself free, because you do what you will; but\nare you free to will, or not to will; to desire, or not to desire? Are not your volitions and desires\nnecessarily excited by objects or qualities totally independent of you?\n81. \"If the actions of men are necessary, if men are not free, by what right does society punish\ncriminals? Is it not very unjust to chastise beings, who could not act otherwise than they have done?\" If\nthe wicked act necessarily according to the impulses of their evil nature, society, in punishing them, acts\nnecessarily by the desire of self-preservation. Certain objects necessarily produce in us the sensation of\npain; our nature then forces us against them, and avert them from us. A tiger, pressed by hunger, springs\nupon the man, whom he wishes to devour; but this man is not master of his fear, and necessarily seeks\nmeans to destroy the tiger.\n82. \"If every thing be necessary, the errors, opinions, and ideas of men are fatal; and, if so, how or why\nshould we attempt to reform them?\" The errors of men are necessary consequences of ignorance. Their\nignorance, prejudice, and credulity are necessary consequences of their inexperience, negligence, and\nwant of reflection, in the same manner as delirium or lethargy are necessary effects of certain diseases.\nTruth, experience, reflection, and reason, are remedies calculated to cure ignorance, fanaticism and\nfollies. But, you will ask, why does not truth produce this effect upon many disordered minds? It is\nbecause some diseases resist all remedies; because it is impossible to cure obstinate patients, who refuse\n21 The Illusion of Free Will 121 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nthe remedies presented to them; because the interest of some men, and the folly of others, necessarily\noppose the admission of truth.\nA cause produces its effect only when its action is not interrupted by stronger causes, which then\nweakens or render useless, the action of the former. It is impossible that the best arguments should be\nadopted by men, who are interested in error, prejudiced in its favour, and who decline all reflection; but\ntruth must necessarily undeceive honest minds, who seek her sincerely. Truth is a cause; it necessarily\nproduces its effects, when its impulse is not intercepted by causes, which suspend its effects.\n83. \"To deprive man of his free will,\" it is said, \"makes him a mere machine, an automaton. Without\nliberty, he will no longer have either merit or virtue.\" What is merit in man? It is a manner of acting,\nwhich renders him estimable in the eyes of his fellow-beings. What is virtue? It is a disposition, which\ninclines us to do good to others. What can there be contemptible in machines, or automatons, capable of\nproducing effects so desirable? Marcus Aurelius was useful to the vast Roman Empire. By what right\nwould a machine despise a machine, whose springs facilitate its action? Good men are springs, which\nsecond society in its tendency to happiness; the wicked are ill-formed springs, which disturb the order,\nprogress, and harmony of society. If, for its own utility, society cherishes and rewards the good, it also\nharasses and destroys the wicked, as useless or hurtful.\n84. The world is a necessary agent. All the beings, that compose it, are united to each other, and cannot\nact otherwise than they do, so long as they are moved by the same causes, and endued with the same\nproperties. When they lose properties, they will necessarily act in a different way. God himself,\nadmitting his existence, cannot be considered a free agent. If there existed a God, his manner of acting\nwould necessarily be determined by the properties inherent in his nature; nothing would be capable of\narresting or altering his will. This being granted, neither our actions, prayers, nor sacrifices could\nsuspend, or change his invariable conduct and immutable designs; whence we are forced to infer, that all\nreligion would be useless.\n85. Were not divines in perpetual contradiction with themselves, they would see, that, according to their\nhypothesis, man cannot be reputed free an instant. Do they not suppose man continually dependent on\nhis God? Are we free, when we cannot exist and be preserved without God, and when we cease to exist\nat the pleasure of his supreme will? If God has made man out of nothing; if his preservation is a\ncontinued creation; if God cannot, an instant, lose sight of his creature; if whatever happens to him, is an\neffect of the divine will; if man can do nothing of himself; if all the events, which he experiences, are\neffects of the divine decrees; if he does no good without grace from on high, how can they maintain, that\na man enjoys a moment's liberty? If God did not preserve him in the moment of sin, how could man sin?\nIf God then preserves him, God forces him to exist, that he may sin.\n21 The Illusion of Free Will 122 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n22\nCompatibilism\nCompatibilism1\nFrankfurt Cases - The Principle of Alternate Possibilities\nAlternative Possibilities are one of the key requirements for the freedom component of free will,\ncritically needed for libertarian free will.\nAlternative Possibilities have been part of the problem of free will at least from the time of Thomas\nHobbes, who denied anyone ever \"could have done otherwise\".\nIn 1961, Harry Frankfurt famously defined what he called \"The Principle of Alternate Possibilities\" or\nPAP.\n\"a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise.\u201d\nFrankfurt developed sophisticated arguments (thought experiments) to disprove this principle using what\nis known as a Frankfurt controller, but might be called Frankfurt's Demon.\nThe Frankfurt is a hypothetical agent who can control the minds of others, either a \"nefarious\nneuroscientist or a demon inside one's mind that can intervene in our decisions. Considering the absurd\nnature of his counterfactual intervener, the recent philosophical literature is surprisingly full of articles\nwith \"Frankfurt-style cases\" supporting Frankfurt, and logical counterexamples to his attack on the\nprinciple of alternate possibilities. This work is based on a logical fallacy\nFrankfurt's basic claim is as follows:\n\"The principle of alternate possibilities is false. A person may well be morally responsible for\nwhat he has done even though he could not have done otherwise. The principle's plausibility is\nan illusion, which can be made to vanish by bringing the relevant moral phenomena into sharper\nfocus.\"\nLibertarians like Robert Kane, David Widerker, and Carl Ginet have mounted attacks on Frankfurt-type\nexamples, in defense of free will.\n1 Reprinted from The Information Philosopher under a CC-BY license.

In The Information Philosopher Retrieved 19:00, January 1, 2017, from\nhttp://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/frankfurt_cases.html\n22 Compatibilism 123 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThe basic idea is that in an indeterministic world Frankfurt's demon cannot know in advance what an\nagent will do. As Widerker put it, there is no \"prior sign\" of the agent's de-liberate choice. This is the\nepistemic Kane-Widerker Objection to Frankfurt-style cases.\nIn information theoretic and ontological terms, the information about the choice does not yet exist in the\nuniverse. So in order to block an agent's decision, the intervening demon would have to act in advance.\nThat would eliminate the agent's control and destroy the presumed \"responsibility\" of the agent for the\nchoice, despite no available alternative possibilities. This is the ontological Information Objection.\nAccording to Daniel Dennett's Default Responsibility Principle, the Frankfurt controller is now\nresponsible, not the agent.\nHere is a discussion of the problem, from Kane's A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will, 2005,\n(p.87)\n5. The Indeterminist World Objection\nWhile the \"flicker of freedom\" strategy will not suffice to refute Frankfurt, it does lead to a third\nobjection that is more powerful. This third objection is one that has been developed by several\nphilosophers, including myself, David Widerker, Carl Ginet, and Keith Wyma.5 We might call it\nthe Indeterministic World Objection. I discuss this objection in my book Free Will and Values.\nFollowing is a summary of this discussion:\nSuppose Jones's choice is undetermined up to the moment when it occurs, as many\nincompatibilists and libertarians require of a free choice. Then a Frankfurt controller,\nsuch as Black, would face a problem in attempting to control Jones's choice. For if it is\nundetermined up to the moment when he chooses whether Jones will choose A or B, then\nthe controller Black cannot know before Jones actually chooses what Jones is going to\ndo. Black may wait until Jones actually chooses in order to see what Jones is going to do.\nBut then it will be too late for Black to intervene. Jones will be responsible for the choice\nin that case, since Black stayed out of it. But Jones will also have had alternative\npossibilities, since Jones's choice of A or B was undetermined and therefore it could have\ngone either way. Suppose, by contrast, Black wants to ensure that Jones will make the\nchoice Black wants (choice A). Then Black cannot stay out of it until Jones chooses. He\nmust instead act in advance to bring it about that Jones chooses A. In that case, Jones will\nindeed have no alternative possibilities, but neither will Jones be responsible for the\noutcome. Black will be responsible since Black will have intervened in order to bring it\nabout that Jones would choose as Black wanted.\nIn other words, if free choices are undetermined, as incompatibilists require, a Frankfurt\ncontroller like Black cannot control them without actually intervening and making the agent\nchoose as the controller wants. If the controller stays out of it, the agent will be responsible but\nwill also have had alternative possibilities because the choice was undetermined. If the controller\ndoes intervene, by contrast, the agent will not have alternative possibilities but will also not be\nresponsible (the controller will be). So responsibility and alternative possibilities go together\n22 Compatibilism 124 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nafter all, and PAP would remain true\u2014moral responsibility requires alternative possibilities\u2014\nwhen free choices are not determined.6\nIf this objection is correct, it would show that Frankfurt-type examples will not work in an\nindeterministic world in which some choices or actions are undetermined. In such a world, as\nDavid Widerker has put it, there will not always be a reliable prior sign telling the controller in\nadvance what agents are going to do.7 Only in a world in which all of our free actions arc\ndetermined can the controller always be certain in advance how the agent is going to act. This\nmeans that, if you are a compatibilist, who believes free will could exist in a determined world,\nyou might be convinced by Frankfurt-type examples that moral responsibility does not require\nalternative possibilities. But if you are an incompatibilist or libertarian, who believes that some\nof our morally responsible acts must be undetermined you need not be convinced by Frankfurt-\ntype examples that moral responsibility does not require alternative possibilities.\n5.

Widerker, 1995, 248ff.\nAlternative Possibilities Are NOT Probabilities\nOne of the major errors in thinking about alternative possibilities is to assume that they are the direct\ncause of action. This leads many philosophers to make the oversimplified assumption that if there are\ntwo possibilities, for example, that they are equally probable, or perhaps one has thirty percent chance of\nleading to action, the other seventy percent.\nAlternative possibilities are simply that - possibilities. They only lead to action following an act of\ndetermination by the will that the action is in accord with the agent's character and values. And the will\nis adequately determined.\nMost philosophers who use the standard argument against free will in their work assume that chance\nalternative possibilities will show up as random behavior. Here is an example from leading libertarian\nincompatibilist Peter van Inwagen. He imagines a God who can \"replay\" exactly the same circumstnces\nto demonstrate the random willings.\nNow let us suppose that God a thousand times caused the universe to revert to exactly the state it\nwas in at t (and let us suppose that we are somehow suitably placed, metaphysically speaking, to\n1\nobserve the whole sequence of \"replays\"). What would have happened? What should we expect\nto observe? Well, again, we can't say what would have happened, but we can say what would\nprobably have happened: sometimes Alice would have lied and sometimes she would have told\nthe truth. As the number of \"replays\" increases, we observers shall \u2014 almost certainly \u2014\nobserve the ratio of the outcome \"truth\" to the outcome \"lie\" settling down to, converging on,\n22 Compatibilism 125 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nsome value. We may, for example, observe that, after a fairly large number of replays, Alice lies\nin thirty percent of the replays and tells the truth in seventy percent of them\u2014and that the figures\n'thirty percent' and 'seventy percent' become more and more accurate as the number of replays\nincreases. But let us imagine the simplest case: we observe that Alice tells the truth in about half\nthe replays and lies in about half the replays. If, after one hundred replays, Alice has told the\ntruth fifty-three times and has lied forty-eight times, we'd begin strongly to suspect that the\nfigures after a thousand replays would look something like this: Alice has told the truth four\nhundred and ninety-three times and has lied five hundred and eight times. Let us suppose that\nthese are indeed the figures after a thousand [1001] replays. Is it not true that as we watch the\nnumber of replays increase we shall become convinced that what will happen in the next replay\nis a matter of chance.\n(\"Free Will Remains a Mystery,\" in Philosophical Perspectives, vol. 14, 2000, p.14)\nIn our two-stage model of free will, if Alice is a generally honest person, her character will ensure that\nshe rarely lies even if lying frequently \"comes to mind\" as one of her alternative possibilities.\n22 Compatibilism 126 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n23\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma1\nThe prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two\ncompletely \"rational\" individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to\ndo so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher working at RAND in 1950. Albert\nW. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it, \"prisoner's dilemma\"\n(Poundstone, 1992), presenting it as follows:\nTwo members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary\nconfinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient\nevidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They hope to get both sentenced to a year in\nprison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each\nprisoner is given the opportunity either to: betray the other by testifying that the other committed\nthe crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:\n\u2022 If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison\n\u2022 If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison\n(and vice versa)\n\u2022 If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser\ncharge)\nIt is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the\nprison sentences they get, and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because\nbetraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested\nprisoners would betray the other, and so the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is\nfor them to betray each other. The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward\nlogically leads both of the prisoners to betray, when they would get a better reward if they both kept\nsilent. In reality, humans display a systemic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games,\nmuch more so than predicted by simple models of \"rational\" self-interested action. A model based on a\ndifferent kind of rationality, where people forecast how the game would be played if they formed\ncoalitions and then maximized their forecasts, has been shown to make better predictions of the rate of\ncooperation in this and similar games, given only the payoffs of the game.\nAn extended \"iterated\" version of the game also exists, where the classic game is played repeatedly\nbetween the same prisoners, and consequently, both prisoners continuously have an opportunity to\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

If the number of times the game will be played is known to the\nplayers, then (by backward induction) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly,\nfor the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed\noptimum strategy, and Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms.\nThe prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many real world situations involving\ncooperative behaviour. In casual usage, the label \"prisoner's dilemma\" may be applied to situations not\nstrictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two\nentities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it\nmerely difficult or expensive, not necessarily impossible, to coordinate their activities to achieve\ncooperation.\nStrategy for the prisoner's dilemma\nBoth cannot communicate, they are separated in two individual rooms. The normal game is shown\nbelow:\nPrisoner A stays silent (cooperates) & Prisoner B stays silent (cooperates): Each serves 1 year\nPrisoner A stays silent (cooperates) & Prisoner B betrays (defects): Prisoner A gets 3 years &\nPrisoner B goes free\nPrisoner A betrays (defects) & Prisoner B stays silent (cooperates): Prisoner A goes free & Prisoner\nB gets 3 years\nPrisoner A betrays (defects) & Prisoner B betrays (defects): Each serves 2 years\nIt is assumed that both understand the nature of the game, and that despite being members of the same\ngang, they have no loyalty to each other and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside\nthe game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the\nother (\"defecting\"). The reasoning involves an argument by dilemma: B will either cooperate or defect.\nIf B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should\nalso defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel\nreasoning will show that B should defect.\nBecause defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation, regardless of the other player's\nchoice, it is a dominant strategy. Mutual defection is the only strong Nash equilibrium in the game (i.e.\nthe only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The\ndilemma then is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but it is not the\nrational outcome because from a self-interested perspective, the choice to cooperate, at the individual\nlevel, is irrational.\nReal-life examples\nThe prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as\nwell as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of\ninterest to the social sciences such as economics, politics, and sociology, as well as to the biological\nsciences such as ethology and evolutionary biology. Many natural processes have been abstracted into\n23 The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma 128 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nmodels in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide\napplicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.\nIn environmental studies\nIn environmental studies, the PD is evident in crises such as global climate-change. It is argued all\ncountries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb CO\n2\nemissions. The immediate benefit to an individual country to maintain current behavior is perceived to\nbe greater than the purported eventual benefit to all countries if behavior was changed, therefore\nexplaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.\nAn important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the\nextent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government\nis therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This\ndifference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that\nthe probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a\ngame-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.\nOsang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation\nalong the lines of Michael Porter's hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is\nsubstantial.\nIn animals\nCooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma.\nOften animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated\nprisoner's dilemma. For example, guppies inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are\nthought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.\nVampire bats are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the\nprisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:\n\u2022 C/C: \"Reward: I get blood on my unlucky nights, which saves me from starving. I have to give\nblood on my lucky nights, which doesn't cost me too much.\"\n\u2022 D/C: \"Temptation: You save my life on my poor night. But then I get the added benefit of not\nhaving to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night.\"\n\u2022 C/D: \"Sucker's Payoff: I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night. But on my bad night\nyou don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death.\"\n\u2022 D/D: \"Punishment: I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights. But I\nrun a real risk of starving on my poor nights.\"\nIn psychology\nIn addiction research / behavioral economics, George Ainslie points out that addiction can be cast as an\nintertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict. In this case, defecting\nmeans relapsing, and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best\n23 The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma 129 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\noutcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome \u2014 in some\nsense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been \"wasted\" because the\nfuture relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is\nquite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult). Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly\n\"better\" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to\nstop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining \"tomorrow\"\nwill be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction. The problem here is that (as in other\nPDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting \"today\", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the\nsame obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.\nJohn Gottman in his research described in \"the science of trust\" defines good relationships as those\nwhere partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.\nIn economics\nAdvertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. When cigarette advertising\nwas legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to\nspend on advertising. The effectiveness of Firm A\u2019s advertising was partially determined by the\nadvertising conducted by Firm B. Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by\nthe advertising conducted by Firm A. If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given\nperiod, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost\nof advertising. Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising. However, should Firm B\nchoose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount\nof advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is\ndependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly\ndifferent from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better\noff were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in\nbusiness situations. For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette\nadvertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.[] This\nanalysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.[]\nWithout enforceable agreements, members of a cartel are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's\ndilemma. 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting'\nmeans selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel\nmembers. Anti-trust authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest\npossible prices for consumers.\nIn sport\nDoping in sport has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.\nTwo competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their\nperformance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then\nthat athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical\ndangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and\nonly the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.\n23 The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma 130 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nMultiplayer dilemmas\nMany real-life dilemmas involve multiple players. Although metaphorical, Hardin's tragedy of the\ncommons may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes\na choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection\nis very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the \"commons\"). A commons dilemma most people\ncan relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house. By not washing dishes an individual can gain by\nsaving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for\nanyone.\nThe commons are not always exploited: William Poundstone, in a book about the prisoner's dilemma\n(see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked.\nIt is possible for people to take a paper without paying (defecting) but very few do, feeling that if they\ndo not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by Elinor Ostrom,\nwinner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel,\nhypothesized that the tragedy of the commons is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced\nby outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons\namong themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve\nthe maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.\nIn international politics\nIn international political theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of\nstrategic realism, which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal\npolicies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given international anarchy. A\nclassic example is an arms race like the Cold War and similar conflicts. During the Cold War the\nopposing alliances of NATO and the Warsaw Pact both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each\nside's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military\ninferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led\nto superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but at the high cost of\ndeveloping and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and\nthere would be no costs.\nAlthough the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to\narm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and\narmament in a war of attrition for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the\neconomic cost. The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological\ncompetition between sovereign states.\n23 The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma 131 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n24\nThe Trial of Leopold and Loeb\nClosing Argument\nThe State of Illinois v. Nathan Leopold & Richard Loeb\nDelivered by Clarence Darrow\nChicago, Illinois, August 22, 1924\n\u2026\nI insist, Your Honor, that had this been the case of two boys of these defendants' age, unconnected with\nfamilies of great wealth, there is not a state's attorney in Illinois who could not have consented at once to\na plea of guilty and a punishment in the penitentiary for life. Not one. No lawyer could have justified\nany other attitude. No prosecution could have justified it.\nWe are here with the lives of two boys imperiled, with the public aroused. For what? Because,\nunfortunately, the parents have money. Nothing else.\nI have heard in the last six weeks nothing but the cry for blood. I have heard from the office of the state's\nattorney only ugly hate. I have heard precedents quoted which would be a disgrace to a savage race. I\nhave seen a court urged almost to the point of threats to hang two boys, in the face of science, in the face\nof philosophy, in the face of humanity, in the face of experience, in the face of all the better and more\nhumane thought of the age.\n\u2026\nWe have said to the public and to this court that neither the parents, nor the friends, nor the attorneys\nwould want these boys released. Unfortunate though it be, it is true, and those the closest to them know\nperfectly well that they should not be released, and that they should be permanently isolated from\nsociety. We are asking this court to save their lives, which is the least and the most that a judge can do.\n\u2026\nWho were these two boys? And how did it happen?\nOn a certain day they killed poor little Robert Franks. They were not to get $10,000; they were to get\n$5,000 if it worked; that is, $5,000 each. Neither one could get more than five, and either one was\nrisking his; neck in the job. So each one of my clients was risking his neck for $5,000, if it had anything\nto do with it, which it did not.\nDid they need the money? Why at this very time, and a few months before, Dickie Loeb had $3,000 [in\nhis] checking account in the bank. Your Honor, I would be ashamed to talk about this except that in all\napparent seriousness they are asking to kill these two boys on the strength of this flimsy foolishness. At\nthat time, Richard Loeb had a three-thousand-dollar checking account in the bank. He had three Liberty\n24 The Trial of Leopold and Loeb 132 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nBonds, one of which was past due, and the interest on each of them had not been collected for three\nyears. And yet they would ask to hang him on the theory that he committed this murder because he\nneeded money.\nHow about Leopold? Leopold was in regular receipt of $125 a month; he had an automobile; paid\nnothing for board and clothes, and expenses; he got money whenever he wanted it, and he had arranged\nto go to Europe and had bought his ticket and was going to leave about the time he was arrested in this\ncase. He passed his examination for the Harvard Law School, and was going to take a short trip to\nEurope before it was time for him to attend the fall term. His ticket had been bought, and his father was\nto give him $3,000 to make the trip. Your Honor, jurors sometimes make mistakes, and courts do, too. If\non this evidence the court is to construe a motive out of this case, then I insist that a motive could be\nconstrued out of any set of circumstances and facts that might be imagined.\nThe boys had been reared in luxury, they had never been denied anything; no want or desire left\nunsatisfied; no debts; no need of money; nothing. And yet they murdered a little boy, against whom they\nhad nothing in the world, without malice, without reason, to get $5,000 each. All right. All right, Your\nHonor, if the court believes it, if anyone believes it, I can't help it. That is what this case rests on. It\ncould not stand up a minute without motive. without it, it was the senseless act of immature and diseased\nchildren, as it was; a senseless act of children, wandering around in the dark and moved by some\nmotion, that we still perhaps have not the knowledge or the insight into life to thoroughly understand.\n\u2026\nWe have sought to tell this court why he should not hang these boys. We have sought to tell this court,\nand to make this court believe, that they were diseased of mind, and that they were of tender age.\nHowever, before I discuss that, I ought to say another word in reference to the question of motive in this\ncase. If there was no motive, except the senseless act of immature boys, then of course there is taken\nfrom this case all of the feeling of deep guilt upon the part of these defendants.\nThere was neither cruelty to the deceased, beyond taking his life, nor was there any depth of guilt and\ndepravity on the part of the defendants, for it was a truly motiveless act, without the slightest feeling of\nhatred or revenge, done by a couple of children for no sane reason.\nBut, Your Honor, we have gone further than that, and we have sought to show you, as I think we have,\nthe condition of these boys' minds. Of course it is not an easy task to find out the condition of another\nperson's mind. Now, I was about to say that it needs no expert, it needs nothing but a bare recitation of\nthese facts, and a fair consideration of them, to convince any human being that this was the act of\ndiseased brains.\nBut let's get to something stronger than that. Were these boys in their right minds? Here were two boys\nwith good intellect, one eighteen and one nineteen. They had all the prospects that life could hold out for\nany of the young; one a graduate of Chicago and another of Ann Arbor; one who had passed his\nexamination for the Harvard Law School and was about to take a trip in Europe, another who had passed\nat Ann Arbor, the youngest in his class, with $3,000 in the bank. Boys who never knew what it was to\nwant a dollar; boys who could reach any position that was given to boys of that kind to reach; boys of\ndistinguished and honorable families, families of wealth and position, with all the world before them.\nAnd they gave it all up for nothing, for nothing! They took a little companion of one of them, on a\n24 The Trial of Leopold and Loeb 133 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\ncrowded street, and killed him, for nothing, and sacrificed everything that could be of value in human\nlife upon the crazy scheme of a couple of immature lads.\nNow, Your Honor, you have been a boy; I have been a boy. And we have known other boys. The best\nway to understand somebody else is to put yourself in his place. Is it within the realm of your\nimagination that a boy who was right, with all the prospects of life before him, who could choose what\nhe wanted, without the slightest reason in the world would lure a young companion to his death, and\ntake his place in the shadow of the gallows?\nHow insane they are I care not, whether medically or legally. They did not reason; they could not\nreason; they committed the most foolish, most unprovoked, most purposeless, most causeless act that\nany two boys ever committed, and they put themselves where the rope is dangling above their heads.\nThere are not physicians enough in the world to convince any thoughtful, fair-minded man that these\nboys are right. Was their act one of deliberation, of intellect, or were they driven by some force such as\nDr. White and Dr. Glueck and Dr. Healy have told this court?\nThere are only two theories; one is that their diseased brains drove them to it; the other is the old theory\nof possession by devils, and my friend Marshall could have read you books on that, too, but it has been\npretty well given up in Illinois. That they were intelligent, sane, sound, and reasoning is unthinkable. Let\nme call Your Honor's attention to another thing.\nWhy did they kill little Bobby Franks? Not for money, not for spite; not for hate. They killed him as they\nmight kill a spider or a fly, for the experience. They killed him because they were made that way.\nBecause somewhere in the infinite processes that go to the making up of the boy or the man something\nslipped, and those unfortunate lads sit here hated, despised, outcasts, with the community shouting for\ntheir blood. Mr. Savage, with the immaturity of youth and inexperience, says that if we hang them there\nwill be no more killing. This world has been one long slaughterhouse from the beginning until today,\nand killing goes on and on and on, and will forever. Why not read something, why not study something,\nwhy not think instead of blindly shouting for death?\nKill them. Will that prevent other senseless boys or other vicious men or vicious women from killing?\nNo! It will simply call upon every weak-minded person to do as they have done. I know how easy it is to\nI talk about mothers when you want to do something cruel. But I am thinking of the others, too. I know\nthat any mother might be the mother of little Bobby Franks, who left his home and went to his school,\nand who never came back. I know that any mother might be the mother of Richard Loeb and Nathan\nLeopold, just the same. The trouble is this, that if she is the mother of a Nathan Leopold or of a Richard\nLoeb, she has to ask herself the question: \"How come my children came to be what they are? From what\nancestry did they get this strain? How far removed was the poison that destroyed their lives? Was I the\nbearer of the seed that brings them to death?\" Any mother might be the mother of any of them. But these\ntwo are the victims.\nNo one knows what will be the fate of the child he gets or the child she bears; the fate of the child is the\nlast thing they consider.\n24 The Trial of Leopold and Loeb 134 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nI am sorry for the fathers as well as the mothers, for the fathers who give their strength and their lives for\neducating and protecting and creating a fortune for the boys that they love; for the mothers who go down\ninto the shadow of death for their children, who nourish them and care for them, and risk their lives, that\nthey may live, who watch them with tenderness and fondness and longing, and who go down into\ndishonor and disgrace for the children that they love.\nAll of these are helpless. We are all helpless. But when you are pitying the father and the mother of poor\nBobby Franks, what about the fathers and mothers of these two unfortunate boys, and what about the,\nunfortunate boys themselves, and what about all the fathers and all the mothers and all the boys and all\nthe girls who tread a dangerous maze in darkness from birth to death?\nDo you think you can cure the hatreds and the maladjustments of the world by hanging them? You\nsimply show your ignorance and your hate when you say it. You may here and there cure hatred with\nlove and understanding, but you can only add fuel to the flames by cruelty and hate.\nYour Honor, that no human being could have done what these boys did, excepting through the operation\nof a diseased brain. I do not propose to go through each step of the terrible deed, it would take too long.\nBut I do want to call the attention of this court to some of the other acts of these two boys, in this\ndistressing and weird homicide; acts which show conclusively that there could be no reason for their\nconduct.\nI want to come down now to the actions on the afternoon of the tragedy.\nWithout any excuse, without the slightest motive, not moved by money, not moved by passion or hatred,\nby nothing except the vague wanderings of children, about four o'clock in the afternoon they started out\nto find somebody to kill. For nothing.\nThey went over to the Harvard School. Dick's little brother was there, on the playground. Dick went\nthere himself in open daylight, known by all of them; he had been a pupil there himself, the school was\nnear his home, and he looked over the little boys. They first picked out a little boy named Levinson, and\nDick trailed him around. Now, of course, that is a hard story. It is a story that shocks one. A boy bent on\nkilling, not knowing where he would go or who he would get, but seeking some victim. Here is a little\nboy, but the circumstances are not opportune, and so he fails to get him. Dick abandons that lead; Dick\nand Nathan are in the car, and they see Bobby Franks on the street, and they call to him to get into the\ncar. It is about five o'clock in the afternoon, in the long summer days, on a thickly settled street, built up\nwith homes, the houses of their friends and their companions known to everybody, automobiles\nappearing and disappearing, and they take him in the car.\nIf there had been a question of revenge, yes; if there had been a question of hate, where no one cares for\nhis own fate, intent only on accomplishing his end, yes. But without any motive or any reason they\npicked up this little boy right in sight of their own homes, and surrounded by their neighbors. They hit\nhim over the head with a chisel and killed him, and go on about their business, driving this car within\nhalf a block of Loeb's home, within the same distance of the Franks's home, drive it past the neighbors\nthat they knew, in the open highway, in broad daylight. And still men will say that they have a bright\nintellect.\n24 The Trial of Leopold and Loeb 135 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nI say again, whatever madness and hate and frenzy may do to the human mind, there is not a single\nperson who reasons who can believe that one of these acts was the act of men, of brains that were not\ndiseased. There is no other explanation for it. And had it not been for the wealth and the weirdness and\nthe notoriety, they would have been sent to the psychopathic hospital for examination, and been taken\ncare of, instead of the state demanding that this court take the last pound of flesh and the last drop of\nblood from two irresponsible lads.\nThey pull the dead boy into the backseat, and wrap him in a blanket, and this funeral car starts on its\nroute. If ever any death car went over the same route or the same kind of a route driven by sane people, I\nhave never heard of it, and I fancy no one else has ever heard of it.\nThis car is driven for twenty miles. The slightest accident, the slightest misfortune, a bit of curiosity, an\narrest for speeding, anything would bring destruction. They go down the Midway, through the park,\nmeeting hundreds of machines, in sight of thousands of eyes, with this dead boy. They go down a\nthickly populated street through South Chicago, and then for three miles take the longest street to go\nthrough this city; built solid with business, buildings, filled with automobiles backed upon the street,\nwith streetcars on the track, with thousands of peering eyes; one boy driving and the other on the\nbackseat, with the corpse of little Bobby Franks, the blood streaming from him, wetting everything in\nthe car.\nAnd yet they tell me that this is sanity; they tell me that the brains of these boys are not diseased. Their\nconduct shows exactly what it was, and shows that this court has before him two young men who should\nbe examined in a psychopathic hospital and treated kindly and with care. They get through South\nChicago, and they take the regular automobile road down toward Hammond. They stop at the forks of\nthe road, and leave little Bobby Franks, soaked with blood, in the machine, and get their dinner, and eat\nit without an emotion or a qualm.\nI repeat, you may search the annals of crime, and you can find no parallel. It is utterly at variance with\nevery motive, and every act and every part of conduct that influences normal people in the commission\nof crime. There is not a sane thing in all of this from the beginning to the end. There was not a normal\nact in any of it, from its inception in a diseased brain, until today, when they sit here awaiting their\ndoom.\nBut we are told that they planned. Well, what does that mean? A maniac plans, an idiot plans, an animal\nplans; any brain that functions may plan. But their plans were the diseased plans of the diseased mind. Is\nthere any man with an air of intellect and a decent regard for human life, and the slightest bit of heart\nthat does not understand this situation? And still, Your Honor, on account of its weirdness and its\nstrangeness, and its advertising, we are forced to fight. For what? Forced to plead to this court that two\nboys, one eighteen and the other nineteen, may be permitted to live in silence and solitude and disgrace\nand spend all their days in the penitentiary. Asking this court and the state's attorney to be merciful\nenough to let these two boys be locked up in a prison until they die.\n24 The Trial of Leopold and Loeb 136 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nUNIT FIVE: ETHICS1\nEthics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and\nrecommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. The term ethics derives from the Ancient Greek\nword \u1f20\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ethikos, which is derived from the word \u1f26\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ethos (habit, \"custom\"). The branch of\nphilosophy axiology comprises the sub-branches of ethics and aesthetics, each concerned with values.\nAs a branch of philosophy, ethics investigates the questions \"What is the best way for people to live?\"\nand \"What actions are right or wrong in particular circumstances?\" In practice, ethics seeks to resolve\nquestions of human morality, by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and\nvice, justice and crime. As a field of intellectual enquiry, moral philosophy also is related to the fields of\nmoral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory.\nThree major areas of study within ethics recognised today are:\n1. Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how\ntheir truth values (if any) can be determined\n2. Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action\n3. Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation\nor a particular domain of action\nDefining ethics\nRushworth Kidder states that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the\nscience of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'\". Richard William Paul and Linda\nElder define ethics as \"a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps\nor harms sentient creatures\". The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the word ethics is\n\"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' ... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the\nmoral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual.\" Paul and Elder state that most people\nconfuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law and\ndon't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.\nThe word \"ethics\" in English refers to several things. It can refer to philosophical ethics or moral\nphilosophy\u2014a project that attempts to use reason in order to answer various kinds of ethical questions.\nAs the English philosopher Bernard Williams writes, attempting to explain moral philosophy: \"What\nmakes an inquiry a philosophical one is reflective generality and a style of argument that claims to be\nrationally persuasive.\" And Williams describes the content of this area of inquiry as addressing the very\nbroad question, \"how one should live\" Ethics can also refer to a common human ability to think about\nethical problems that is not particular to philosophy. As bioethicist Larry Churchill has written: \"Ethics,\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. Citation: Ethics. (2016, December 26).

For example: \"Joe has strange ethics.\"\nThe English word ethics is derived from an Ancient Greek word \u00eathikos, which means \"relating to one's\ncharacter\". The Ancient Greek adjective \u00eathikos is itself derived from another Greek word, the noun\n\u00eathos meaning \"character, disposition\".\nMeta-ethics\nMeta-ethics asks how we understand, know about, and what we mean when we talk about what is right\nand what is wrong. An ethical question fixed on some particular practical question\u2014such as, \"Should I\neat this particular piece of chocolate cake?\"\u2014cannot be a meta-ethical question. A meta-ethical question\nis abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, \"Is it ever\npossible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?\" would be a meta-ethical question.\nMeta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less\nprecise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical\nknowledge as depending upon habit and acculturation in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds\nof knowledge. Meta-ethics is also important in G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica from 1903. In it he first\nwrote about what he called the naturalistic fallacy. Moore was seen to reject naturalism in ethics, in his\nOpen Question Argument. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier,\nthe Scottish philosopher David Hume had put forward a similar view on the difference between facts\nand values.\nStudies of how we know in ethics divide into cognitivism and non-cognitivism; this is similar to the\ncontrast between descriptivists and non-descriptivists. Non-cognitivism is the claim that when we judge\nsomething as right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may for example be only expressing our\nemotional feelings about these things. Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about\nright and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.\nThe ontology of ethics is about value-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred\nto by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a\nspecific ontology, since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position.\nRealists on the other hand must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics,\nhow they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.\nNormative ethics\nNormative ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of\nquestions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is\ndistinct from meta-ethics because it examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions,\nwhile meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts. Normative\nethics is also distinct from descriptive ethics, as the latter is an empirical investigation of people's moral\nbeliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion\nof people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is\nUNIT FIVE: ETHICS 138 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\ncorrect to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than\ndescriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called moral realism, moral facts are\nboth descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.\nTraditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right\nand wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving\ndifficult moral decisions.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and are no longer concerned solely\nwith rightness and wrongness, but are interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the\nmiddle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This\nfocus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in analytic philosophy and by the\npopularity of logical positivism.\nIn 1971 John Rawls published A Theory of Justice, noteworthy in its pursuit of moral arguments and\neschewing of meta-ethics. This publication set the trend for renewed interest in normative ethics.\nUNIT FIVE: ETHICS 139 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n25\nThe Myth of Gyges\nThe Myth of Gyges1\n[Glaucon is speaking to Socrates on the topic of justice]\nThey say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than\nthe good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not\nbeing able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves\nto have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is\ntermed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; --it is a mean or\ncompromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all,\nwhich is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between\nthe two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men\nto do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if\nhe were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature\nand origin of justice.\nNow that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust\nwill best appear if we imagine something of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power\nto do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then we shall discover in the\nvery act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest, which all\nnatures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law. The\nliberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is\nsaid to have been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition,\nGyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake\nmade an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. Amazed at the sight, he\ndescended into the opening, where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having\ndoors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him, more than\nhuman, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended.\nNow the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about\nthe flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting\namong them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible\nto the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present. He was\nastonished at this, and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made\nseveral trials of the ring, and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he became\ninvisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers\nwho were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help\n1 From Plato's Republic, Book III, written around 360 BCE, Translated by Benjamin Jowett, 1910\n25 The Myth of Gyges 140 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nconspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were two such\nmagic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other;,no man can be imagined to be of\nsuch an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not\nhis own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any\none at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a God\namong men. Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at\nlast to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly\nor because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one\nthinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is\nfar more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say\nthat they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never\ndoing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most\nwretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one\nanother from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of this.\nNow, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust, we must isolate them; there is\nno other way; and how is the isolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust,\nand the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either of them, and both are to be\nperfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives. First, let the unjust be like other distinguished\nmasters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician, who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps\nwithin their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. So let the unjust make his\nunjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is found\nout is nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed just when you are not. Therefore I say\nthat in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction,\nbut we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the greatest reputation for\njustice. If he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak\nwith effect, if any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is required his\ncourage and strength, and command of money and friends. And at his side let us place the just man in\nhis nobleness and simplicity, wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no\nseeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and then we shall not know\nwhether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be\nclothed in justice only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of life the\nopposite of the former. Let him be the best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will have\nbeen put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its\nconsequences. And let him continue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust. When\nboth have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let judgment be\ngiven which of them is the happier of the two.\n25 The Myth of Gyges 141 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n26\nThe Euthyphro Dilemma\nThe Euthyphro Dilemma1\nThe Euthyphro dilemma is found in Plato's dialogue Euthyphro, in which Socrates asks\nEuthyphro, \"Is the pious (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it\nis loved by the gods?\" (10a)\nThe dilemma has had a major effect on the philosophical theism of the monotheistic religions, but in a\nmodified form: \"Is what is morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally\ngood because it is commanded by God?\" Ever since Plato's original discussion, this question has\npresented a problem for some theists, though others have thought it a false dilemma, and it continues to\nbe an object of theological and philosophical discussion today.\nThe dilemma\nSocrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety in Plato's Euthyphro. Euthyphro proposes (6e) that\nthe pious (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) is the same thing as that which is loved by the gods (\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2), but Socrates\nfinds a problem with this proposal: the gods may disagree among themselves (7e). Euthyphro then\nrevises his definition, so that piety is only that which is loved by all of the gods unanimously (9e).\nAt this point the dilemma surfaces. Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious,\nor whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both\naccept the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates\nargues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot\nexplain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they together\nwould yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being\nthe pious because the gods love it. And this in turn means, Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same\nas the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-\nbeloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is the fact that the gods love it, whereas\nwhat makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro's theory does not give us the\nvery nature of the pious, but at most a quality of the pious (11ab).\nIn philosophical theism\nThe dilemma can be modified to apply to philosophical theism, where it is still the object of theological\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

As German\nphilosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz presented this version of the dilemma: \"It is generally\nagreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and\njust because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether\njustice and goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the\nnature of things.\"\nExplanation of the dilemma\nThe first horn\nThe first horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is commanded by God because it is right) goes by\na variety of names, including intellectualism, rationalism, realism, naturalism, and objectivism. Roughly,\nit is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves,\nindependent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's\ndialogue. The Mu'tazilah school of Islamic theology also defended the view (with, for example, Nazzam\nmaintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying), as did the Islamic philosopher\nAverroes. Thomas Aquinas never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars\noften put him on this side of the issue. Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself\nand what is good or evil because of God's commands, with unchangeable moral standards forming the\nbulk of natural law. Thus he contends that not even God can change the Ten Commandments (adding,\nhowever, that God can change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like\nspecial dispensations to murder or steal). Among later Scholastics, Gabriel V\u00e1squez is particularly clear-\ncut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's. Modern natural law theory saw Grotius\nand Leibniz also putting morality prior to God's will, comparing moral truths to unchangeable\nmathematical truths, and engaging voluntarists like Pufendorf in philosophical controversy. Cambridge\nPlatonists like Benjamin Whichcote and Ralph Cudworth mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist\ntheories, paving the way for the later rationalist metaethics of Samuel Clarke and Richard Price; what\nemerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist\nindependently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary philosophers of religion who\nembrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include Richard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson (though see\nbelow for complications).\nProblems\nSovereignty: If there are moral standards independent of God's will, then \"[t]here is something over\nwhich God is not sovereign. God is bound by the laws of morality instead of being their establisher.\nMoreover, God depends for his goodness on the extent to which he conforms to an independent moral\nstandard. Thus, God is not absolutely independent.\" 18th-century philosopher Richard Price, who takes\nthe first horn and thus sees morality as \"necessary and immutable\", sets out the objection as follows: \"It\nmay seem that this is setting up something distinct from God, which is independent of him, and equally\neternal and necessary.\"\nOmnipotence: These moral standards would limit God's power: not even God could oppose them by\ncommanding what is evil and thereby making it good. This point was influential in Islamic theology: \"In\nrelation to God, objective values appeared as a limiting factor to His power to do as He wills... Ash'ari\ngot rid of the whole embarrassing problem by denying the existence of objective values which might act\nas a standard for God's action.\" Similar concerns drove the medieval voluntarists Duns Scotus and\nWilliam of Ockham. As contemporary philosopher Richard Swinburne puts the point, this horn \"seems\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 143 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nto place a restriction on God's power if he cannot make any action which he chooses obligatory... [and\nalso] it seems to limit what God can command us to do. God, if he is to be God, cannot command us to\ndo what, independently of his will, is wrong.\"\nFreedom of the will: Moreover, these moral standards would limit God's freedom of will: God could not\ncommand anything opposed to them, and perhaps would have no choice but to command in accordance\nwith them. As Mark Murphy puts the point, \"if moral requirements existed prior to God's willing them,\nrequirements that an impeccable God could not violate, God's liberty would be compromised.\"\nMorality without God: If there are moral standards independent of God, then morality would retain its\nauthority even if God did not exist. This conclusion was explicitly (and notoriously) drawn by early\nmodern political theorist Hugo Grotius: \"What we have been saying [about the natural law] would have\na degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded without the utmost\nwickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to him\" On such a view,\nGod is no longer a \"law-giver\" but at most a \"law-transmitter\" who plays no vital role in the foundations\nof morality. Nontheists have capitalized on this point, largely as a way of disarming moral arguments for\nGod's existence: if morality does not depend on God in the first place, such arguments stumble at the\nstarting gate.\nThe second horn\nThe second horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is right because it is commanded by God) is\nsometimes known as divine command theory or voluntarism. Roughly, it is the view that there are no\nmoral standards other than God's will: without God's commands, nothing would be right or wrong. This\nview was partially defended by Duns Scotus, who argued that not all Ten Commandments belong to the\nNatural Law. Scotus held that while our duties to God (found on the first tablet) are self-evident, true by\ndefinition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were\narbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace. William of Ockham went\nfurther, contending that (since there is no contradiction in it) God could command us not to love God\nand even to hate God. Later Scholastics like Pierre D'Ailly and his student Jean de Gerson explicitly\nconfronted the Euthyphro dilemma, taking the voluntarist position that God does not \"command good\nactions because they are good or prohibit evil ones because they are evil; but... these are therefore good\nbecause they are commanded and evil because prohibited.\" Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John\nCalvin both stressed the absolute sovereignty of God's will, with Luther writing that \"for [God's] will\nthere is no cause or reason that can be laid down as a rule or measure for it\", and Calvin writing that\n\"everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it.\" The\nvoluntarist emphasis on God's absolute power was carried further by Descartes, who notoriously held\nthat God had freely created the eternal truths of logic and mathematics, and that God was therefore\ncapable of giving circles unequal radii, giving triangles other than 180 internal degrees, and even\nmaking contradictions true. Descartes explicitly seconded Ockham: \"why should [God] not have been\nable to give this command [i.e., the command to hate God] to one of his creatures?\" Thomas Hobbes\nnotoriously reduced the justice of God to \"irresistible power\" (drawing the complaint of Bishop\nBramhall that this \"overturns... all law\"). And William Paley held that all moral obligations bottom out\nin the self-interested \"urge\" to avoid Hell and enter Heaven by acting in accord with God's commands.\nIslam's Ash'arite theologians, al-Ghazali foremost among them, embraced voluntarism: scholar George\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 144 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nHourani writes that the view \"was probably more prominent and widespread in Islam than in any other\ncivilization.\" Wittgenstein said that of \"the two interpretations of the Essence of the Good\", that which\nholds that \"the Good is good, in virtue of the fact that God wills it\" is \"the deeper\", while that which\nholds that \"God wills the good, because it is good\" is \"the shallow, rationalistic one, in that it behaves 'as\nthough' that which is good could be given some further foundation\". Today, divine command theory is\ndefended by many philosophers of religion, though typically in a restricted form (see below).\nProblems\nThis horn of the dilemma also faces several problems:\nNo reasons for morality: If there is no moral standard other than God's will, then God's commands are\narbitrary (i.e., based on pure whimsy or caprice). This would mean that morality is ultimately not based\non reasons: \"if theological voluntarism is true, then God's commands/intentions must be arbitrary; [but]\nit cannot be that morality could wholly depend on something arbitrary... [for] when we say that some\nmoral state of affairs obtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of affairs obtaining\nrather than another.\" And as Michael J. Murray and Michael Rea put it, this would also \"cas[t] doubt on\nthe notion that morality is genuinely objective.\" An additional problem is that it is difficult to explain\nhow true moral actions can exist if one acts only out of fear of God or in an attempt to be rewarded by\nhim.\nNo reasons for God: This arbitrariness would also jeopardize God's status as a wise and rational being,\none who always acts on good reasons. As Leibniz writes: \"Where will be his justice and his wisdom if\nhe has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord\nwith the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it\nseems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must\nprecede the act.\"\nAnything goes: This arbitrariness would also mean that anything could become good, and anything\ncould become bad, merely upon God's command. Thus if God commanded us \"to gratuitously inflict\npain on each other\" or to engage in \"cruelty for its own sake\" or to hold an \"annual sacrifice of randomly\nselected ten-year-olds in a particularly gruesome ritual that involves excruciating and prolonged\nsuffering for its victims\", then we would be morally obligated to do so. As 17th-century philosopher\nRalph Cudworth put it: \"nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but\nif it were supposed to be commanded by this omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis\nforthwith become holy, just, and righteous.\"\nMoral contingency: If morality depends on the perfectly free will of God, morality would lose its\nnecessity: \"If nothing prevents God from loving things that are different from what God actually loves,\nthen goodness can change from world to world or time to time. This is obviously objectionable to those\nwho believe that claims about morality are, if true, necessarily true.\" In other words, no action is\nnecessarily moral: any right action could have easily been wrong, if God had so decided, and an action\nwhich is right today could easily become wrong tomorrow, if God so decides. Indeed, some have argued\nthat divine command theory is incompatible with ordinary conceptions of moral supervenience.\nWhy do God's commands obligate?: Mere commands do not create obligations unless the commander\nhas some commanding authority. But this commanding authority cannot itself be based on those very\ncommands (i.e., a command to obey commands), otherwise a vicious circle results. So, in order for\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 145 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nGod's commands to obligate us, he must derive commanding authority from some source other than his\nown will. As Cudworth put it: \"For it was never heard of, that any one founded all his authority of\ncommanding others, and others [sic] obligation or duty to obey his commands, in a law of his own\nmaking, that men should be required, obliged, or bound to obey him. Wherefore since the thing willed in\nall laws is not that men should be bound or obliged to obey; this thing cannot be the product of the meer\n[sic] will of the commander, but it must proceed from something else; namely, the right or authority of\nthe commander.\" To avoid the circle, one might say our obligation comes from gratitude to God for\ncreating us. But this presupposes some sort of independent moral standard obligating us to be grateful to\nour benefactors. As 18th-century philosopher Francis Hutcheson writes: \"Is the Reason exciting to\nconcur with the Deity this, 'The Deity is our Benefactor?' Then what Reason excites to concur with\nBenefactors?\" Or finally, one might resort to Hobbes's view: \"The right of nature whereby God reigneth\nover men, and punisheth those that break his laws, is to be derived, not from his creating them (as if he\nrequired obedience, as of gratitude for his benefits), but from his irresistible power.\" In other words,\nmight makes right.\nGod's goodness: If all goodness is a matter of God's will, then what shall become of God's goodness?\nThus William P. Alston writes, \"since the standards of moral goodness are set by divine commands, to\nsay that God is morally good is just to say that he obeys his own commands... that God practises what he\npreaches, whatever that might be;\" Hutcheson deems such a view \"an insignificant tautology, amounting\nto no more than this, 'That God wills what he wills.'\" Alternatively, as Leibniz puts it, divine command\ntheorists \"deprive God of the designation good: for what cause could one have to praise him for what he\ndoes, if in doing something quite different he would have done equally well?\" A related point is raised\nby C. S. Lewis: \"if good is to be defined as what God commands, then the goodness of God Himself is\nemptied of meaning and the commands of an omnipotent fiend would have the same claim on us as\nthose of the 'righteous Lord.'\" Or again Leibniz: \"this opinion would hardly distinguish God from the\ndevil.\" That is, since divine command theory trivializes God's goodness, it is incapable of explaining the\ndifference between God and an all-powerful demon.\nThe is-ought problem and the naturalistic fallacy: According to David Hume, it is hard to see how moral\npropositions featuring the relation ought could ever be deduced from ordinary is propositions, such as\n\"the being of a God.\" Divine command theory is thus guilty of deducing moral oughts from ordinary ises\nabout God's commands. In a similar vein, G. E. Moore argued (with his open question argument) that\nthe notion good is indefinable, and any attempts to analyze it in naturalistic or metaphysical terms are\nguilty of the so-called \"naturalistic fallacy.\" This would block any theory which analyzes morality in\nterms of God's will: and indeed, in a later discussion of divine command theory, Moore concluded that\n\"when we assert any action to be right or wrong, we are not merely making an assertion about the\nattitude of mind towards it of any being or set of beings whatever.\"\nNo morality without God: If all morality is a matter of God's will, then if God does not exist, there is no\nmorality. This is the thought captured in the slogan (often attributed to Dostoevsky) \"If God does not\nexist, everything is permitted.\" Divine command theorists disagree over whether this is a problem for\ntheir view or a virtue of their view. Many argue that morality does indeed require God's existence, and\nthat this is in fact a problem for atheism. But divine command theorist Robert Merrihew Adams\ncontends that this idea (\"that no actions would be ethically wrong if there were not a loving God\") is one\nthat \"will seem (at least initially) implausible to many\", and that his theory must \"dispel [an] air of\nparadox.\"\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 146 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nResponses to the dilemma\nMany philosophers and theologians have addressed the Euthyphro dilemma since the time of Plato,\nthough not always with reference to the Platonic dialogue. According to scholar Terence Irwin, the issue\nand its connection with Plato was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th\ncenturies. More recently, it has received a great deal of attention from contemporary philosophers\nworking in metaethics and the philosophy of religion. Philosophers and theologians aiming to defend\ntheism against the threat of the dilemma have developed a variety of responses.\nIndependent moral standards\nContemporary philosophers Joshua Hoffman and Gary S. Rosenkrantz take the first horn of the\ndilemma, branding divine command theory a \"subjective theory of value\" that makes morality arbitrary.\nThey accept a theory of morality on which \"right and wrong, good and bad, are in a sense independent\nof what anyone believes, wants, or prefers.\" They do not address the aforementioned problems with the\nfirst horn, but do consider a related problem concerning God's omnipotence: namely, that it might be\nhandicapped by his inability to bring about what is independently evil. To this they reply that God is\nomnipotent, even though there are states of affairs he cannot bring about: omnipotence is a matter of\n\"maximal power\", not an ability to bring about all possible states of affairs. And supposing that it is\nimpossible for God not to exist, then since there cannot be more than one omnipotent being, it is\ntherefore impossible for any being to have more power than God (e.g., a being who is omnipotent but\nnot omnibenevolent). Thus God's omnipotence remains intact.\nRichard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson have a slightly more complicated view. They both take the first\nhorn of the dilemma when it comes to necessary moral truths. But divine commands are not totally\nirrelevant, for God and his will can still affect contingent moral truths. On the one hand, the most\nfundamental moral truths hold true regardless of whether God exists or what God has commanded:\n\"Genocide and torturing children are wrong and would remain so whatever commands any person\nissued.\" This is because, according to Swinburne, such truths are true as a matter of logical necessity:\nlike the laws of logic, one cannot deny them without contradiction.\nThis parallel offers a solution to the aforementioned problems of God's sovereignty, omnipotence, and\nfreedom: namely, that these necessary truths of morality pose no more of a threat than the laws of logic.\nOn the other hand, there is still an important role for God's will. First, there are some divine commands\nthat can directly create moral obligations: e.g., the command to worship on Sundays instead of on\nTuesdays. Notably, not even these commands, for which Swinburne and Mawson take the second horn\nof the dilemma, have ultimate, underived authority. Rather, they create obligations only because of\nGod's role as creator and sustainer and indeed owner of the universe, together with the necessary moral\ntruth that we owe some limited consideration to benefactors and owners. Second, God can make an\nindirect moral difference by deciding what sort of universe to create. For example, whether a public\npolicy is morally good might indirectly depend on God's creative acts: the policy's goodness or badness\nmight depend on its effects, and those effects would in turn depend on the sort of universe God has\ndecided to create.\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 147 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nRestricted divine command theory\nOne common response to the Euthyphro dilemma centers on a distinction between value and obligation.\nObligation, which concerns rightness and wrongness (or what is required, forbidden, or permissible), is\ngiven a voluntarist treatment. But value, which concerns goodness and badness, is treated as\nindependent of divine commands. The result is a restricted divine command theory that applies only to a\nspecific region of morality: the deontic region of obligation. This response is found in Francisco\nSu\u00e1rez's discussion of natural law and voluntarism in De legibus and has been prominent in\ncontemporary philosophy of religion, appearing in the work of Robert M. Adams, Philip L. Quinn, and\nWilliam P. Alston.\nA significant attraction of such a view is that, since it allows for a non-voluntarist treatment of goodness\nand badness, and therefore of God's own moral attributes, some of the aforementioned problems with\nvoluntarism can perhaps be answered. God's commands are not arbitrary: there are reasons which guide\nhis commands based ultimately on this goodness and badness. God could not issue horrible commands:\nGod's own essential goodness or loving character would keep him from issuing any unsuitable\ncommands. Our obligation to obey God's commands does not result in circular reasoning; it might\ninstead be based on a gratitude whose appropriateness is itself independent of divine commands. These\nproposed solutions are controversial, and some steer the view back into problems associated with the\nfirst horn.\nOne problem remains for such views: if God's own essential goodness does not depend on divine\ncommands, then on what does it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine\ncommand theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the\nultimate standard for goodness. Alston offers the analogy of the standard meter bar in France.\nSomething is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard meter bar, and likewise,\nsomething is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why God is identified as the ultimate\nstandard for goodness, Alston replies that this is \"the end of the line,\" with no further explanation\navailable, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard.\nOn this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's will, it still depends on God, and thus\nGod's sovereignty remains intact.\nThis solution has been criticized by Wes Morriston. If we identify the ultimate standard for goodness\nwith God's nature, then it seems we are identifying it with certain properties of God (e.g., being loving,\nbeing just). If so, then the dilemma resurfaces: is God good because he has those properties, or are those\nproperties good because God has them? Nevertheless, Morriston concludes that the appeal to God's\nessential goodness is the divine-command theorist's best bet. To produce a satisfying result, however, it\nwould have to give an account of God's goodness that does not trivialize it and does not make God\nsubject to an independent standard of goodness.\nMoral philosopher Peter Singer, disputing the perspective that \"God is good\" and could never advocate\nsomething like torture, states that those who propose this are \"caught in a trap of their own making, for\nwhat can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?\"\nFalse dilemma response\nAugustine, Anselm, and Aquinas all wrote about the issues raised by the Euthyphro dilemma, although,\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 148 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nlike William James and Wittgenstein later, they did not mention it by name. As philosopher and Anselm\nscholar Katherin A. Rogers observes, many contemporary philosophers of religion suppose that there are\ntrue propositions which exist as platonic abstracta independently of God. Among these are propositions\nconstituting a moral order, to which God must conform in order to be good. Classical Judaeo-Christian\ntheism, however, rejects such a view as inconsistent with God's omnipotence, which requires that God\nand what he has made is all that there is. \"The classical tradition,\" Rogers notes, \"also steers clear of the\nother horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory.\" From a classical theistic perspective,\ntherefore, the Euthyphro dilemma is false. As Rogers puts it, \"Anselm, like Augustine before him and\nAquinas later, rejects both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. God neither conforms to nor invents the\nmoral order. Rather His very nature is the standard for value.\"\nJewish thought\nThe basis of the false dilemma response\u2014God's nature is the standard for value\u2014predates the dilemma\nitself, appearing first in the thought of the eighth-century BC Hebrew prophets, Amos, Hosea, Micah\nand Isaiah. (Amos lived some three centuries before Socrates and two before Thales, traditionally\nregarded as the first Greek philosopher.) \"Their message,\" writes British scholar Norman H. Snaith, \"is\nrecognized by all as marking a considerable advance on all previous ideas,\" not least in its \"special\nconsideration for the poor and down-trodden.\" As Snaith observes, tsedeq, the Hebrew word for\nrighteousness, \"actually stands for the establishment of God's will in the land.\" This includes justice, but\ngoes beyond it, \"because God's will is wider than justice. He has a particular regard for the helpless ones\non earth.\" Tsedeq \"is the norm by which all must be judged\" and it \"depends entirely upon the Nature of\nGod.\"\nHebrew has few abstract nouns. What the Greeks thought of as ideas or abstractions, the Hebrews\nthought of as activities. In contrast to the Greek dikaiosune (justice) of the philosophers, tsedeq is not an\nidea abstracted from this world of affairs. As Snaith writes:\nTsedeq is something that happens here, and can be seen, and recognized, and known. It follows,\ntherefore, that when the Hebrew thought of tsedeq (righteousness), he did not think of Righteousness in\ngeneral, or of Righteousness as an Idea. On the contrary, he thought of a particular righteous act, an\naction, concrete, capable of exact description, fixed in time and space.... If the word had anything like a\ngeneral meaning for him, then it was as it was represented by a whole series of events, the sum-total of a\nnumber of particular happenings.\nThe Hebrew stance on what came to be called the problem of universals, as on much else, was very\ndifferent from that of Plato and precluded anything like the Euthyphro dilemma. This has not changed.\nIn 2005, Jonathan Sacks wrote, \"In Judaism, the Euthyphro dilemma does not exist.\" Jewish\nphilosophers Avi Sagi and Daniel Statman criticized the Euthyphro dilemma as \"misleading\" because \"it\nis not exhaustive\": it leaves out a third option, namely that God \"acts only out of His nature.\"\nSt. Thomas Aquinas\nLike Aristotle, Aquinas rejected Platonism. In his view, to speak of abstractions not only as existent, but\nas more perfect exemplars than fully designated particulars, is to put a premium on generality and\nvagueness. On this analysis, the abstract \"good\" in the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma is an\nunnecessary obfuscation. Aquinas frequently quoted with approval Aristotle's definition, \"Good is what\nall desire.\" As he clarified, \"When we say that good is what all desire, it is not to be understood that\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 149 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nevery kind of good thing is desired by all, but that whatever is desired has the nature of good.\" In other\nwords, even those who desire evil desire it \"only under the aspect of good,\" i.e., of what is desirable. The\ndifference between desiring good and desiring evil is that in the former, will and reason are in harmony,\nwhereas in the latter, they are in discord.\nAquinas's discussion of sin provides a good point of entry to his philosophical explanation of why the\nnature of God is the standard for value. \"Every sin,\" he writes, \"consists in the longing for a passing [i.e.,\nultimately unreal or false] good.\" Thus, \"in a certain sense it is true what Socrates says, namely that no\none sins with full knowledge.\" \"No sin in the will happens without an ignorance of the understanding.\"\nGod, however, has full knowledge (omniscience) and therefore by definition (that of Socrates, Plato, and\nAristotle as well as Aquinas) can never will anything other than what is good. It has been claimed \u2014 for\ninstance, by Nicolai Hartmann, who wrote: \"There is no freedom for the good that would not be at the\nsame time freedom for evil\" \u2014 that this would limit God's freedom, and therefore his omnipotence.\nJosef Pieper, however, replies that such arguments rest upon an impermissibly anthropomorphic\nconception of God. In the case of humans, as Aquinas says, to be able to sin is indeed a consequence, or\neven a sign, of freedom (quodam libertatis signum). Humans, in other words, are not puppets\nmanipulated by God so that they always do what is right. However, \"it does not belong to the essence of\nthe free will to be able to decide for evil.\" \"To will evil is neither freedom nor a part of freedom.\" It is\nprecisely humans' creatureliness \u2014 that is, their not being God and therefore omniscient \u2014 that makes\nthem capable of sinning. Consequently, writes Pieper, \"the inability to sin should be looked on as the\nvery signature of a higher freedom \u2014 contrary to the usual way of conceiving the issue.\" Pieper\nconcludes: \"Only the will [i.e., God's] can be the right standard of its own willing and must will what is\nright necessarily, from within itself, and always. A deviation from the norm would not even be\nthinkable. And obviously only the absolute divine will is the right standard of its own act\" \u2014 and\nconsequently of all human acts. Thus the second horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command\ntheory, is also disposed of.\nWilliam James\nWilliam James, in his essay \"The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life\", dismisses the first horn of the\nEuthyphro dilemma and stays clear of the second. He writes: \"Our ordinary attitude of regarding\nourselves as subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true 'in themselves,' is ... either an out-\nand-out superstition, or else it must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real Thinker\n... to whom the existence of the universe is due.\" Moral obligations are created by \"personal demands,\"\nwhether these demands come from the weakest creatures, from the most insignificant persons, or from\nGod. It follows that \"ethics have as genuine a foothold in a universe where the highest consciousness is\nhuman, as in a universe where there is a God as well.\" However, whether \"the purely human system\"\nworks \"as well as the other is a different question.\"\nFor James, the deepest practical difference in the moral life is between what he calls \"the easy-going and\nthe strenuous mood.\" In a purely human moral system, it is hard to rise above the easy-going mood,\nsince the thinker's \"various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the\nsame denominational value; he can play fast and loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely\nhuman world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximum stimulating\npower.\" Our attitude is \"entirely different\" in a world where there are none but \"finite demanders\" from\nthat in a world where there is also \"an infinite demander.\" This is because \"the stable and systematic\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 150 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nmoral universe for which the ethical philosopher asks is fully possible only in a world where there is a\ndivine thinker with all-enveloping demands\", for in that case, \"actualized in his thought already must be\nthat ethical philosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore approach.\" Even\nthough \"exactly what the thought of this infinite thinker may be is hidden from us\", our postulation of\nhim serves \"to let loose in us the strenuous mood\" and confront us with an existential \"challenge\" in\nwhich \"our total character and personal genius ... are on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy,\nour choice and use of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or incapacity for moral life.\nFrom this unsparing practical ordeal no professor's lectures and no array of books can save us.\" In the\nwords of Richard M. Gale, \"God inspires us to lead the morally strenuous life in virtue of our conceiving\nof him as unsurpassably good. This supplies James with an adequate answer to the underlying question\nof the Euthyphro.\"\nIn popular culture\nIn the song \"No Church in the Wild\" from the album Watch the Throne, rapper Jay Z references the\ndilemma with the line, \"Is pious pious 'cause God loves pious? Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek.\"\n26 The Euthyphro Dilemma 151 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n27\nUtilitarianism\nUtilitarianism1\nChapter 2\nWhat Utilitarianism Is.\n\u2026The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle,\nholds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to\nproduce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by\nunhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure. To give a clear view of the moral standard set up by the\ntheory, much more requires to be said; in particular, what things it includes in the ideas of pain and\npleasure; and to what extent this is left an open question. But these supplementary explanations do not\naffect the theory of life on which this theory of morality is grounded- namely, that pleasure, and freedom\nfrom pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things (which are as numerous in\nthe utilitarian as in any other scheme) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as\nmeans to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain.\nNow, such a theory of life excites in many minds, and among them in some of the most estimable in\nfeeling and purpose, inveterate dislike. To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than\npleasure- no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit- they designate as utterly mean and\ngrovelling; as a doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurus were, at a very early\nperiod, contemptuously likened; and modern holders of the doctrine are occasionally made the subject of\nequally polite comparisons by its German, French, and English assailants.\nWhen thus attacked, the Epicureans have always answered, that it is not they, but their accusers, who\nrepresent human nature in a degrading light; since the accusation supposes human beings to be capable\nof no pleasures except those of which swine are capable. If this supposition were true, the charge could\nnot be gainsaid, but would then be no longer an imputation; for if the sources of pleasure were precisely\nthe same to human beings and to swine, the rule of life which is good enough for the one would be good\nenough for the other. The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as degrading,\nprecisely because a beast's pleasures do not satisfy a human being's conceptions of happiness. Human\nbeings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and when once made conscious of them,\ndo not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification. I do not, indeed, consider\nthe Epicureans to have been by any means faultless in drawing out their scheme of consequences from\nthe utilitarian principle. To do this in any sufficient manner, many Stoic, as well as Christian elements\nrequire to be included. But there is no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the\npleasures of the intellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments, a much higher\n1 From Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill, 1863\n27 Utilitarianism 152 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nvalue as pleasures than to those of mere sensation. It must be admitted, however, that utilitarian writers\nin general have placed the superiority of mental over bodily pleasures chiefly in the greater permanency,\nsafety, uncostliness, etc., of the former- that is, in their circumstantial advantages rather than in their\nintrinsic nature. And on all these points utilitarians have fully proved their case; but they might have\ntaken the other, and, as it may be called, higher ground, with entire consistency. It is quite compatible\nwith the principle of utility to recognise the fact, that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and\nmore valuable than others. It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is\nconsidered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity\nalone.\nIf I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more\nvaluable than another, merely as a pleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one possible\nanswer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a\ndecided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable\npleasure. If one of the two is, by those who are competently acquainted with both, placed so far above\nthe other that they prefer it, even though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount of discontent,\nand would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which their nature is capable of, we are\njustified in ascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far outweighing quantity as\nto render it, in comparison, of small account.\nNow it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with, and equally capable of\nappreciating and enjoying, both, do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which\nemploys their higher faculties. Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower\nanimals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would\nconsent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience\nwould be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is\nbetter satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs. They would not resign what they possess more than\nhe for the most complete satisfaction of all the desires which they have in common with him. If they\never fancy they would, it is only in cases of unhappiness so extreme, that to escape from it they would\nexchange their lot for almost any other, however undesirable in their own eyes. A being of higher\nfaculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly\naccessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never\nreally wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence. We may give what explanation\nwe please of this unwillingness; we may attribute it to pride, a name which is given indiscriminately to\nsome of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which mankind are capable: we may\nrefer it to the love of liberty and personal independence, an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of\nthe most effective means for the inculcation of it; to the love of power, or to the love of excitement, both\nof which do really enter into and contribute to it: but its most appropriate appellation is a sense of\ndignity, which all human beings possess in one form or other, and in some, though by no means in exact,\nproportion to their higher faculties, and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it\nis strong, that nothing which conflicts with it could be, otherwise than momentarily, an object of desire\nto them.\nWhoever supposes that this preference takes place at a sacrifice of happiness- that the superior being, in\nanything like equal circumstances, is not happier than the inferior- confounds the two very different\nideas, of happiness, and content. It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low,\n27 Utilitarianism 153 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nhas the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly endowed being will always feel that\nany happiness which he can look for, as the world is constituted, is imperfect. But he can learn to bear\nits imperfections, if they are at all bearable; and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed\nunconscious of the imperfections, but only because he feels not at all the good which those\nimperfections qualify. It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be\nSocrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because\nthey only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\nIt may be objected, that many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence\nof temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the\nintrinsic superiority of the higher. Men often, from infirmity of character, make their election for the\nnearer good, though they know it to be the less valuable; and this no less when the choice is between\ntwo bodily pleasures, than when it is between bodily and mental. They pursue sensual indulgences to the\ninjury of health, though perfectly aware that health is the greater good.\nIt may be further objected, that many who begin with youthful enthusiasm for everything noble, as they\nadvance in years sink into indolence and selfishness. But I do not believe that those who undergo this\nvery common change, voluntarily choose the lower description of pleasures in preference to the higher. I\nbelieve that before they devote themselves exclusively to the one, they have already become incapable\nof the other. Capacity for the nobler feelings is in most natures a very tender plant, easily killed, not only\nby hostile influences, but by mere want of sustenance; and in the majority of young persons it speedily\ndies away if the occupations to which their position in life has devoted them, and the society into which\nit has thrown them, are not favourable to keeping that higher capacity in exercise. Men lose their high\naspirations as they lose their intellectual tastes, because they have not time or opportunity for indulging\nthem; and they addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer them, but\nbecause they are either the only ones to which they have access, or the only ones which they are any\nlonger capable of enjoying. It may be questioned whether any one who has remained equally susceptible\nto both classes of pleasures, ever knowingly and calmly preferred the lower; though many, in all ages,\nhave broken down in an ineffectual attempt to combine both.\nFrom this verdict of the only competent judges, I apprehend there can be no appeal. On a question which\nis the best worth having of two pleasures, or which of two modes of existence is the most grateful to the\nfeelings, apart from its moral attributes and from its consequences, the judgment of those who are\nqualified by knowledge of both, or, if they differ, that of the majority among them, must be admitted as\nfinal. And there needs be the less hesitation to accept this judgment respecting the quality of pleasures,\nsince there is no other tribunal to be referred to even on the question of quantity. What means are there\nof determining which is the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations, except\nthe general suffrage of those who are familiar with both? Neither pains nor pleasures are homogeneous,\nand pain is always heterogeneous with pleasure. What is there to decide whether a particular pleasure is\nworth purchasing at the cost of a particular pain, except the feelings and judgment of the experienced?\nWhen, therefore, those feelings and judgment declare the pleasures derived from the higher faculties to\nbe preferable in kind, apart from the question of intensity, to those of which the animal nature, disjoined\nfrom the higher faculties, is suspectible, they are entitled on this subject to the same regard.\nI have dwelt on this point, as being a necessary part of a perfectly just conception of Utility or\nHappiness, considered as the directive rule of human conduct. But it is by no means an indispensable\ncondition to the acceptance of the utilitarian standard; for that standard is not the agent's own greatest\n27 Utilitarianism 154 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nhappiness, but the greatest amount of happiness altogether; and if it may possibly be doubted whether a\nnoble character is always the happier for its nobleness, there can be no doubt that it makes other people\nhappier, and that the world in general is immensely a gainer by it. Utilitarianism, therefore, could only\nattain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character, even if each individual were only\nbenefited by the nobleness of others, and his own, so far as happiness is concerned, were a sheer\ndeduction from the benefit. But the bare enunciation of such an absurdity as this last, renders refutation\nsuperfluous.\nAccording to the Greatest Happiness Principle, as above explained, the ultimate end, with reference to\nand for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that\nof other people), is an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible in\nenjoyments, both in point of quantity and quality; the test of quality, and the rule for measuring it against\nquantity, being the preference felt by those who in their opportunities of experience, to which must be\nadded their habits of self-consciousness and self-observation, are best furnished with the means of\ncomparison. This, being, according to the utilitarian opinion, the end of human action, is necessarily also\nthe standard of morality; which may accordingly be defined, the rules and precepts for human conduct,\nby the observance of which an existence such as has been described might be, to the greatest extent\npossible, secured to all mankind; and not to them only, but, so far as the nature of things admits, to the\nwhole sentient creation\u2026\n\u2026I must again repeat, what the assailants of utilitarianism seldom have the justice to acknowledge, that\nthe happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct, is not the agent's own\nhappiness, but that of all concerned. As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism\nrequires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator. In the golden rule of\nJesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by,\nand to love your neighbour as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality. As the\nmeans of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social\narrangements should place the happiness, or (as speaking practically it may be called) the interest, of\nevery individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that\neducation and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to\nestablish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the\ngood of the whole; especially between his own happiness and the practice of such modes of conduct,\nnegative and positive, as regard for the universal happiness prescribes; so that not only he may be unable\nto conceive the possibility of happiness to himself, consistently with conduct opposed to the general\ngood, but also that a direct impulse to promote the general good may be in every individual one of the\nhabitual motives of action, and the sentiments connected therewith may fill a large and prominent place\nin every human being's sentient existence. If the, impugners of the utilitarian morality represented it to\ntheir own minds in this its, true character, I know not what recommendation possessed by any other\nmorality they could possibly affirm to be wanting to it; what more beautiful or more exalted\ndevelopments of human nature any other ethical system can be supposed to foster, or what springs of\naction, not accessible to the utilitarian, such systems rely on for giving effect to their mandates\u2026\n27 Utilitarianism 155 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nChapter 4\nOf what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible.\nIT HAS already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary\nacceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the\nfirst premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact,\nmay be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our\ninternal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or\nby what other faculty is cognisance taken of them?\nQuestions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is,\nthat happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable\nas means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the\ndoctrine should fulfil- to make good its claim to be believed?\nThe only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only\nproof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like\nmanner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people\ndo actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in\npractice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason\ncan be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to\nbe attainable, desires his own happiness. This, however, being a fact, we have not only all the proof\nwhich the case admits of, but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that each\nperson's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate\nof all persons. Happiness has made out its title as one of the ends of conduct, and consequently one of\nthe criteria of morality.\nBut it has not, by this alone, proved itself to be the sole criterion. To do that, it would seem, by the same\nrule, necessary to show, not only that people desire happiness, but that they never desire anything else.\nNow it is palpable that they do desire things which, in common language, are decidedly distinguished\nfrom happiness. They desire, for example, virtue, and the absence of vice, no less really than pleasure\nand the absence of pain. The desire of virtue is not as universal, but it is as authentic a fact, as the desire\nof happiness. And hence the opponents of the utilitarian standard deem that they have a right to infer\nthat there are other ends of human action besides happiness, and that happiness is not the standard of\napprobation and disapprobation.\nBut does the utilitarian doctrine deny that people desire virtue, or maintain that virtue is not a thing to be\ndesired? The very reverse. It maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be desired\ndisinterestedly, for itself. Whatever may be the opinion of utilitarian moralists as to the original\nconditions by which virtue is made virtue; however they may believe (as they do) that actions and\ndispositions are only virtuous because they promote another end than virtue; yet this being granted, and\nit having been decided, from considerations of this description, what is virtuous, they not only place\nvirtue at the very head of the things which are good as means to the ultimate end, but they also recognise\nas a psychological fact the possibility of its being, to the individual, a good in itself, without looking to\nany end beyond it; and hold, that the mind is not in a right state, not in a state conformable to Utility, not\nin the state most conducive to the general happiness, unless it does love virtue in this manner- as a thing\n27 Utilitarianism 156 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\ndesirable in itself, even although, in the individual instance, it should not produce those other desirable\nconsequences which it tends to produce, and on account of which it is held to be virtue. This opinion is\nnot, in the smallest degree, a departure from the Happiness principle. The ingredients of happiness are\nvery various, and each of them is desirable in itself, and not merely when considered as swelling an\naggregate. The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any\ngiven exemption from pain, as for example health, is to be looked upon as means to a collective\nsomething termed happiness, and to be desired on that account. They are desired and desirable in and for\nthemselves; besides being means, they are a part of the end. Virtue, according to the utilitarian doctrine,\nis not naturally and originally part of the end, but it is capable of becoming so; and in those who love it\ndisinterestedly it has become so, and is desired and cherished, not as a means to happiness, but as a part\nof their happiness.\nTo illustrate this farther, we may remember that virtue is not the only thing, originally a means, and\nwhich if it were not a means to anything else, would be and remain indifferent, but which by association\nwith what it is a means to, comes to be desired for itself, and that too with the utmost intensity. What,\nfor example, shall we say of the love of money? There is nothing originally more desirable about money\nthan about any heap of glittering pebbles. Its worth is solely that of the things which it will buy; the\ndesires for other things than itself, which it is a means of gratifying. Yet the love of money is not only\none of the strongest moving forces of human life, but money is, in many cases, desired in and for itself;\nthe desire to possess it is often stronger than the desire to use it, and goes on increasing when all the\ndesires which point to ends beyond it, to be compassed by it, are falling off. It may, then, be said truly,\nthat money is desired not for the sake of an end, but as part of the end. From being a means to happiness,\nit has come to be itself a principal ingredient of the individual's conception of happiness. The same may\nbe said of the majority of the great objects of human life- power, for example, or fame; except that to\neach of these there is a certain amount of immediate pleasure annexed, which has at least the semblance\nof being naturally inherent in them; a thing which cannot be said of money. Still, however, the strongest\nnatural attraction, both of power and of fame, is the immense aid they give to the attainment of our other\nwishes; and it is the strong association thus generated between them and all our objects of desire, which\ngives to the direct desire of them the intensity it often assumes, so as in some characters to surpass in\nstrength all other desires. In these cases the means have become a part of the end, and a more important\npart of it than any of the things which they are means to. What was once desired as an instrument for the\nattainment of happiness, has come to be desired for its own sake. In being desired for its own sake it is,\nhowever, desired as part of happiness. The person is made, or thinks he would be made, happy by its\nmere possession; and is made unhappy by failure to obtain it. The desire of it is not a different thing\nfrom the desire of happiness, any more than the love of music, or the desire of health. They are included\nin happiness. They are some of the elements of which the desire of happiness is made up. Happiness is\nnot an abstract idea, but a concrete whole; and these are some of its parts. And the utilitarian standard\nsanctions and approves their being so. Life would be a poor thing, very ill provided with sources of\nhappiness, if there were not this provision of nature, by which things originally indifferent, but\nconducive to, or otherwise associated with, the satisfaction of our primitive desires, become in\nthemselves sources of pleasure more valuable than the primitive pleasures, both in permanency, in the\nspace of human existence that they are capable of covering, and even in intensity.\nVirtue, according to the utilitarian conception, is a good of this description. There was no original desire\nof it, or motive to it, save its conduciveness to pleasure, and especially to protection from pain. But\nthrough the association thus formed, it may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great\n27 Utilitarianism 157 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nintensity as any other good; and with this difference between it and the love of money, of power, or of\nfame, that all of these may, and often do, render the individual noxious to the other members of the\nsociety to which he belongs, whereas there is nothing which makes him so much a blessing to them as\nthe cultivation of the disinterested love of virtue. And consequently, the utilitarian standard, while it\ntolerates and approves those other acquired desires, up to the point beyond which they would be more\ninjurious to the general happiness than promotive of it, enjoins and requires the cultivation of the love of\nvirtue up to the greatest strength possible, as being above all things important to the general happiness.\nIt results from the preceding considerations, that there is in reality nothing desired except happiness.\nWhatever is desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately to happiness, is\ndesired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired for itself until it has become so.\n27 Utilitarianism 158 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n28\nThe Categorical Imperative\nThe Categorical Imperative1\n\u2026Now all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically. The former represent the\npractical necessity of a possible action as means to something else that is willed (or at least which one\nmight possibly will). The categorical imperative would be that which represented an action as necessary\nof itself without reference to another end, i. e., as objectively necessary\u2026\nFinally, there is an imperative which commands a certain conduct immediately, without having as its\ncondition any other purpose to be attained by it. This imperative is categorical. It concerns not the matter\nof the action, or its intended result, but its form and the principle of which it is itself a result; and what is\nessentially good in it consists in the mental disposition, let the consequence be what it may. This\nimperative may be called that of morality. There is a marked distinction also between the volitions on\nthese three sorts of principles in the dissimilarity of the obligation of the will. In order to mark this\ndifference more clearly, I think they would be most suitably named in their order if we said they are\neither rules of skill, or counsels of prudence, or commands (laws) of morality. For it is law only that\ninvolves the conception of an unconditional and objective necessity, which is consequently universally\nvalid; and commands are laws which must be obeyed, that is, must be followed, even in opposition to\ninclination\u2026\nThere is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely, this: Act only on that maxim whereby thou\ncanst at the same time will that it should become a universal law. Now if all imperatives of duty can be\ndeduced from this one imperative as from their principle, then, although it should remain undecided\nwhat is called duty is not merely a vain notion, yet at least we shall be able to show what we understand\nby it and what this notion means. Since the universality of the law according to which effects are\nproduced constitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense (as to form), that is the\nexistence of things so far as it is determined by general laws, the imperative of duty may be expressed\nthus: Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature. We will\nnow enumerate a few duties, adopting the usual division of them into duties to ourselves and ourselves\nand to others, and into perfect and imperfect duties\u2026\n1. A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels wearied of life, but is still so far in\npossession of his reason that he can ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his duty to himself\nto take his own life. Now he inquires whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of\nnature. His maxim is: \u201cFrom self-love I adopt it as a principle to shorten my life when its longer duration\nis likely to bring more evil than satisfaction.\u201d It is asked then simply whether this principle founded on\nself-love can become a universal law of nature. Now we see at once that a system of nature of which it\n1 From Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals by Immanuel Kant, 1785, translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott in 1883\n28 The Categorical Imperative 159 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nshould be a law to destroy life by means of the very feeling whose special nature it is to impel to the\nimprovement of life would contradict itself and, therefore, could not exist as a system of nature; hence\nthat maxim cannot possibly exist as a universal law of nature and, consequently, would be wholly\ninconsistent with the supreme principle of all duty.\n2. Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows that he will not be able to\nrepay it, but sees also that nothing will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite\ntime. He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience as to ask himself: \u201cIs it not\nunlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way?\u201d Suppose however that he\nresolves to do so: then the maxim of his action would be expressed thus: \u201cWhen I think myself in want\nof money, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can do so.\u201d Now\nthis principle of self-love or of one\u2019s own advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future\nwelfare; but the question now is, \u201cIs it right?\u201d I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal\nlaw, and state the question thus: \u201cHow would it be if my maxim were a universal law?\u201d Then I see at\nonce that it could never hold as a universal law of nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For\nsupposing it to be a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should be able to\npromise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping his promise, the promise itself would\nbecome impossible, as well as the end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider\nthat anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such statements as vain pretences.\n3. A third finds in himself a talent which with the help of some culture might make him a useful man in\nmany respects. But he finds himself in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in pleasure\nrather than to take pains in enlarging and improving his happy natural capacities. He asks, however,\nwhether his maxim of neglect of his natural gifts, besides agreeing with his inclination to indulgence,\nagrees also with what is called duty. He sees then that a system of nature could indeed subsist with such\na universal law although men (like the South Sea islanders) should let their talents rest and resolve to\ndevote their lives merely to idleness, amusement, and propagation of their species- in a word, to\nenjoyment; but he cannot possibly will that this should be a universal law of nature, or be implanted in\nus as such by a natural instinct. For, as a rational being, he necessarily wills that his faculties be\ndeveloped, since they serve him and have been given him, for all sorts of possible purposes.\n4. A fourth, who is in prosperity, while he sees that others have to contend with great wretchedness and\nthat he could help them, thinks: \u201cWhat concern is it of mine? Let everyone be as happy as Heaven\npleases, or as be can make himself; I will take nothing from him nor even envy him, only I do not wish\nto contribute anything to his welfare or to his assistance in distress!\u201d Now no doubt if such a mode of\nthinking were a universal law, the human race might very well subsist and doubtless even better than in\na state in which everyone talks of sympathy and good-will, or even takes care occasionally to put it into\npractice, but, on the other side, also cheats when he can, betrays the rights of men, or otherwise violates\nthem. But although it is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance with that\nmaxim, it is impossible to will that such a principle should have the universal validity of a law of nature.\nFor a will which resolved this would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might occur in which one\nwould have need of the love and sympathy of others, and in which, by such a law of nature, sprung from\nhis own will, he would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires. These are a few of the many\nactual duties, or at least what we regard as such, which obviously fall into two classes on the one\nprinciple that we have laid down.\n28 The Categorical Imperative 160 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nWe must be able to will that a maxim of our action should be a universal law. This is the canon of the\nmoral appreciation of the action generally. Some actions are of such a character that their maxim cannot\nwithout contradiction be even conceived as a universal law of nature, far from it being possible that we\nshould will that it should be so. In others this intrinsic impossibility is not found, but still it is impossible\nto will that their maxim should be raised to the universality of a law of nature, since such a will would\ncontradict itself It is easily seen that the former violate strict or rigorous (inflexible) duty; the latter only\nlaxer (meritorious) duty. Thus it has been completely shown how all duties depend as regards the nature\nof the obligation (not the object of the action) on the same principle. If now we attend to ourselves on\noccasion of any transgression of duty, we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim should be\na universal law, for that is impossible for us; on the contrary, we will that the opposite should remain a\nuniversal law, only we assume the liberty of making an exception in our own favour or (just for this time\nonly) in favour of our inclination.\nConsequently if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view, namely, that of reason, we\nshould find a contradiction in our own will, namely, that a certain principle should be objectively\nnecessary as a universal law, and yet subjectively should not be universal, but admit of exceptions. As\nhowever we at one moment regard our action from the point of view of a will wholly conformed to\nreason, and then again look at the same action from the point of view of a will affected by inclination,\nthere is not really any contradiction, but an antagonism of inclination to the precept of reason, whereby\nthe universality of the principle is changed into a mere generality, so that the practical principle of\nreason shall meet the maxim half way. Now, although this cannot be justified in our own impartial\njudgement, yet it proves that we do really recognise the validity of the categorical imperative and (with\nall respect for it) only allow ourselves a few exceptions, which we think unimportant and forced from\nus. We have thus established at least this much, that if duty is a conception which is to have any import\nand real legislative authority for our actions, it can only be expressed in categorical and not at all in\nhypothetical imperatives. We have also, which is of great importance, exhibited clearly and definitely\nfor every practical application the content of the categorical imperative, which must contain the\nprinciple of all duty if there is such a thing at all.\n28 The Categorical Imperative 161 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n29\nBeyond Good and Evil\nBeyond Good and Evil1\nIn a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still\nprevail on the earth, I found certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected with one another,\nuntil finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light.\nThere is MASTER-MORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,\u2014I would at once add, however,\nthat in all higher and mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two\nmoralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed\nsometimes their close juxtaposition\u2014even in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions of moral\nvalues have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled\u2014or\namong the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts.\nIn the first case, when it is the rulers who determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted,\nproud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of\nrank. The noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted,\nproud disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of\nmorality the antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\" means practically the same as \"noble\" and \"despicable\",\u2014the\nantithesis \"good\" and \"EVIL\" is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and\nthose thinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their\nconstrained glances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused, the\nmendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:\u2014it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the\ncommon people are untruthful. \"We truthful ones\"\u2014the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves.\nIt is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and\nwere only derivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when\nhistorians of morals start with questions like, \"Why have sympathetic actions been praised?\" The noble\ntype of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he\npasses the judgment: \"What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;\" he knows that it is he himself only\nwho confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in\nhimself: such morality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of\npower, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which\nwould fain give and bestow:\u2014the noble man also helps the unfortunate, but not\u2014or scarcely\u2014out of\npity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The noble man honours in\nhimself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to\nkeep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has reverence for all\n1 Friedrich Nietzsche, 1906, translated by Helen Zimmern, 1906\n29 Beyond Good and Evil 162 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nthat is severe and hard. \"Wotan placed a hard heart in my breast,\" says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is\nthus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not being\nmade for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: \"He who has not a hard heart when\nyoung, will never have one.\" The noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the\nmorality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in\nDESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical\nenmity and irony towards \"selflessness,\" belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn\nand precaution in presence of sympathy and the \"warm heart.\"\nIt is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention. The\nprofound reverence for age and for tradition\u2014all law rests on this double reverence,\u2014the belief and\nprejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the\npowerful; and if, reversely, men of \"modern ideas\" believe almost instinctively in \"progress\" and the\n\"future,\" and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\" has\ncomplacently betrayed itself thereby.\nA morality of the ruling class, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day\ntaste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards\nbeings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or \"as the heart desires,\"\nand in any case \"beyond good and evil\": it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a\nplace. The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge\u2014both only\nwithin the circle of equals,\u2014artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a\ncertain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance\u2014in\nfact, in order to be a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as\nhas been pointed out, is not the morality of \"modern ideas,\" and is therefore at present difficult to\nrealize, and also to unearth and disclose.\nIt is otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the\nabused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves\nshould moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a pessimistic\nsuspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of\nman, together with his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he\nhas a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything \"good\" that is there honoured\u2014\nhe would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE\nqualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded\nwith light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence, humility,\nand friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only means\nof supporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.\nHere is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis \"good\" and \"evil\":\u2014power and\ndangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do\nnot admit of being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the \"evil\" man arouses fear;\naccording to master-morality, it is precisely the \"good\" man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it,\nwhile the bad man is regarded as the despicable being.\n29 Beyond Good and Evil 163 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nThe contrast attains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-\nmorality, a shade of depreciation\u2014it may be slight and well-intentioned\u2014at last attaches itself to the\n\"good\" man of this morality; because, according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in\nany case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme.\nEverywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the\nsignifications of the words \"good\" and \"stupid.\"\n29 Beyond Good and Evil 164 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\n30\nVirtue Ethics\nAristotle\u2019s Virtues1\nBook I\nvii\nPresumably, however, to say that happiness is the chief good seems a platitude, and a clearer account of\nwhat it is still desired. This might perhaps be given, if we could first ascertain the function of man. For\njust as for a flute-player, a sculptor, or an artist, and, in general, for all things that have a function or\nactivity, the good and the 'well' is thought to reside in the function, so would it seem to be for man, if he\nhas a function. Have the carpenter, then, and the tanner certain functions or activities, and has man\nnone? Is he born without a function? Or as eye, hand, foot, and in general each of the parts evidently has\na function, may one lay it down that man similarly has a function apart from all these? What then can\nthis be? Life seems to be common even to plants, but we are seeking what is peculiar to man. Let us\nexclude, therefore, the life of nutrition and growth. Next there would be a life of perception, but it also\nseems to be common even to the horse, the ox, and every animal. There remains, then, an active life of\nthe element that has a rational principle; of this, one part has such a principle in the sense of being\nobedient to one, the other in the sense of possessing one and exercising thought. And, as 'life of the\nrational element' also has two meanings, we must state that life in the sense of activity is what we mean;\nfor this seems to be the more proper sense of the term. Now if the function of man is an activity of soul\nwhich follows or implies a rational principle, and if we say 'so-and-so-and 'a good so-and-so' have a\nfunction which is the same in kind, e.g. a lyre, and a good lyre-player, and so without qualification in all\ncases, eminence in respect of goodness being idded to the name of the function (for the function of a\nlyre-player is to play the lyre, and that of a good lyre-player is to do so well): if this is the case, and we\nstate the function of man to be a certain kind of life, and this to be an activity or actions of the soul\nimplying a rational principle, and the function of a good man to be the good and noble performance of\nthese, and if any action is well performed when it is performed in accordance with the appropriate\nexcellence: if this is the case, human good turns out to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue, and\nif there are more than one virtue, in accordance with the best and most complete.\nBut we must add 'in a complete life.' For one swallow does not make a summer, nor does one day; and\nso too one day, or a short time, does not make a man blessed and happy\u2026\nviii\nWe must consider it, however, in the light not only of our conclusion and our premisses, but also of what\nis commonly said about it; for with a true view all the data harmonize, but with a false one the facts soon\nclash. Now goods have been divided into three classes, and some are described as external, others as\nrelating to soul or to body; we call those that relate to soul most properly and truly goods, and psychical\n1 From Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, written circa 350 BCE, translated by W D Ross, 1925\n30 Virtue Ethics 165 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nactions and activities we class as relating to soul. Therefore our account must be sound, at least\naccording to this view, which is an old one and agreed on by philosophers. It is correct also in that we\nidentify the end with certain actions and activities; for thus it falls among goods of the soul and not\namong external goods. Another belief which harmonizes with our account is that the happy man lives\nwell and does well; for we have practically defined happiness as a sort of good life and good action. The\ncharacteristics that are looked for in happiness seem also, all of them, to belong to what we have defined\nhappiness as being. For some identify happiness with virtue, some with practical wisdom, others with a\nkind of philosophic wisdom, others with these, or one of these, accompanied by pleasure or not without\npleasure; while others include also external prosperity. Now some of these views have been held by\nmany men and men of old, others by a few eminent persons; and it is not probable that either of these\nshould be entirely mistaken, but rather that they should be right in at least some one respect or even in\nmost respects.\nWith those who identify happiness with virtue or some one virtue our account is in harmony; for to\nvirtue belongs virtuous activity. But it makes, perhaps, no small difference whether we place the chief\ngood in possession or in use, in state of mind or in activity. For the state of mind may exist without\nproducing any good result, as in a man who is asleep or in some other way quite inactive, but the activity\ncannot; for one who has the activity will of necessity be acting, and acting well. And as in the Olympic\nGames it is not the most beautiful and the strongest that are crowned but those who compete (for it is\nsome of these that are victorious), so those who act win, and rightly win, the noble and good things in\nlife.\nTheir life is also in itself pleasant. For pleasure is a state of soul, and to each man that which he is said to\nbe a lover of is pleasant; e.g. not only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses, and a spectacle to the\nlover of sights, but also in the same way just acts are pleasant to the lover of justice and in general\nvirtuous acts to the lover of virtue. Now for most men their pleasures are in conflict with one another\nbecause these are not by nature pleasant, but the lovers of what is noble find pleasant the things that are\nby nature pleasant; and virtuous actions are such, so that these are pleasant for such men as well as in\ntheir own nature. Their life, therefore, has no further need of pleasure as a sort of adventitious charm,\nbut has its pleasure in itself. For, besides what we have said, the man who does not rejoice in noble\nactions is not even good; since no one would call a man just who did not enjoy acting justly, nor any\nman liberal who did not enjoy liberal actions; and similarly in all other cases. If this is so, virtuous\nactions must be in themselves pleasant. But they are also good and noble, and have each of these\nattributes in the highest degree, since the good man judges well about these attributes; his judgement is\nsuch as we have described. Happiness then is the best, noblest, and most pleasant thing in the world, and\nthese attributes are not severed as in the inscription at Delos-\nMost noble is that which is justest, and best is health;\nBut pleasantest is it to win what we love.\nFor all these properties belong to the best activities; and these, or one- the best- of these, we identify\nwith happiness.\nYet evidently, as we said, it needs the external goods as well; for it is impossible, or not easy, to do\nnoble acts without the proper equipment. In many actions we use friends and riches and political power\nas instruments; and there are some things the lack of which takes the lustre from happiness, as good\n30 Virtue Ethics 166 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nbirth, goodly children, beauty; for the man who is very ugly in appearance or ill-born or solitary and\nchildless is not very likely to be happy, and perhaps a man would be still less likely if he had thoroughly\nbad children or friends or had lost good children or friends by death. As we said, then, happiness seems\nto need this sort of prosperity in addition; for which reason some identify happiness with good fortune,\nthough others identify it with virtue\u2026\nx\n\u2026When then should we not say that he is happy who is active in accordance with complete virtue and is\nsufficiently equipped with external goods, not for some chance period but throughout a complete life?\nOr must we add 'and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his life'? Certainly the future is\nobscure to us, while happiness, we claim, is an end and something in every way final. If so, we shall call\nhappy those among living men in whom these conditions are, and are to be, fulfilled- but happy men. So\nmuch for these questions\u2026.\nBook II\ni\nVirtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth\nand its growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes\nabout as a result of habit, whence also its name (ethike) is one that is formed by a slight variation from\nthe word ethos (habit). From this it is also plain that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for\nnothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature. For instance the stone which by\nnature moves downwards cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it by\nthrowing it up ten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move downwards, nor can anything else\nthat by nature behaves in one way be trained to behave in another. Neither by nature, then, nor contrary\nto nature do the virtues arise in us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them, and are made perfect\nby habit.\nAgain, of all the things that come to us by nature we first acquire the potentiality and later exhibit the\nactivity (this is plain in the case of the senses; for it was not by often seeing or often hearing that we got\nthese senses, but on the contrary we had them before we used them, and did not come to have them by\nusing them); but the virtues we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as\nwell. For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them, e.g. men become\nbuilders by building and lyreplayers by playing the lyre; so too we become just by doing just acts,\ntemperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.\nThis is confirmed by what happens in states; for legislators make the citizens good by forming habits in\nthem, and this is the wish of every legislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in\nthis that a good constitution differs from a bad one.\nAgain, it is from the same causes and by the same means that every virtue is both produced and\ndestroyed, and similarly every art; for it is from playing the lyre that both good and bad lyre-players are\nproduced. And the corresponding statement is true of builders and of all the rest; men will be good or\nbad builders as a result of building well or badly. For if this were not so, there would have been no need\nof a teacher, but all men would have been born good or bad at their craft. This, then, is the case with the\nvirtues also; by doing the acts that we do in our transactions with other men we become just or unjust,\n30 Virtue Ethics 167 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nand by doing the acts that we do in the presence of danger, and being habituated to feel fear or\nconfidence, we become brave or cowardly. The same is true of appetites and feelings of anger; some\nmen become temperate and good-tempered, others self-indulgent and irascible, by behaving in one way\nor the other in the appropriate circumstances. Thus, in one word, states of character arise out of like\nactivities. This is why the activities we exhibit must be of a certain kind; it is because the states of\ncharacter correspond to the differences between these. It makes no small difference, then, whether we\nform habits of one kind or of another from our very youth; it makes a very great difference, or rather all\nthe difference\u2026\nii\n\u2026First, then, let us consider this, that it is the nature of such things to be destroyed by defect and excess,\nas we see in the case of strength and of health (for to gain light on things imperceptible we must use the\nevidence of sensible things); both excessive and defective exercise destroys the strength, and similarly\ndrink or food which is above or below a certain amount destroys the health, while that which is\nproportionate both produces and increases and preserves it. So too is it, then, in the case of temperance\nand courage and the other virtues. For the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand\nhis ground against anything becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet\nevery danger becomes rash; and similarly the man who indulges in every pleasure and abstains from\nnone becomes self-indulgent, while the man who shuns every pleasure, as boors do, becomes in a way\ninsensible; temperance and courage, then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by the\nmean\u2026\nvi\n\u2026If it is thus, then, that every art does its work well- by looking to the intermediate and judgling its\nworks by this standard (so that we often say of good works of art that it is not possible either to take\naway or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the goodness of works of art, while the\nmean preserves it; and good artists, as we say, look to this in their work), and if, further, virtue is more\nexact and better than any art, as nature also is, then virtue must have the quality of aiming at the\nintermediate. I mean moral virtue; for it is this that is concerned with passions and actions, and in these\nthere is excess, defect, and the intermediate. For instance, both fear and confidence and appetite and\nanger and pity and in general pleasure and pain may be felt both too much and too little, and in both\ncases not well; but to feel them at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right\npeople, with the right motive, and in the right way, is what is both intermediate and best, and this is\ncharacteristic of virtue. Similarly with regard to actions also there is excess, defect, and the intermediate.\nNow virtue is concerned with passions and actions, in which excess is a form of failure, and so is defect,\nwhile the intermediate is praised and is a form of success; and being praised and being successful are\nboth characteristics of virtue. Therefore virtue is a kind of mean, since, as we have seen, it aims at what\nis intermediate.\nAgain, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the class of the unlimited, as the\nPythagoreans conjectured, and good to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way\n(for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult- to miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for\nthese reasons also, then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue;\nFor men are good in but one way, but bad in many.\n30 Virtue Ethics 168 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY READER\nVirtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a mean, i.e. the mean relative to us,\nthis being determined by a rational principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical\nwisdom would determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which depends on excess and that\nwhich depends on defect; and again it is a mean because the vices respectively fall short of or exceed\nwhat is right in both passions and actions, while virtue both finds and chooses that which is\nintermediate. Hence in respect of its substance and the definition which states its essence virtue is a\nmean, with regard to what is best and right an extreme.\nBut not every action nor every passion admits of a mean; for some have names that already imply\nbadness, e.g. spite, shamelessness, envy, and in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all of\nthese and suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves bad, and not the excesses or\ndeficiencies of them. It is not possible, then, ever to be right with regard to them; one must always be\nwrong. Nor does goodness or badness with regard to such things depend on committing adultery with\nthe right woman, at the right time, and in the right way, but simply to do any of them is to go wrong. It\nwould be equally absurd, then, to expect that in unjust, cowardly, and voluptuous action there should be\na mean, an excess, and a deficiency; for at that rate there would be a mean of excess and of deficiency,\nan excess of excess, and a deficiency of deficiency. But as there is no excess and deficiency of\ntemperance and courage because what is intermediate is in a sense an extreme, so too of the actions we\nhave mentioned there is no mean nor any excess and deficiency, but however they are done they are\nwrong; for in general there is neither a mean of excess and deficiency, nor excess and deficiency of a\nmean.\n30 Virtue Ethics 169"
