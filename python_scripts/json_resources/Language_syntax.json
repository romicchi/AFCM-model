{"text":"01:615:201\nIntroduction to Linguistic\nTheory\nAdam Szczegielniak\nSyntax: The Sentence\nPatterns of\nLanguage\nCopyright in part: Cengage learning Learning Goals\n\u2022 Hierarchical sentence structure\n\u2022 Word categories\n\u2022 X-\u00ad\u2010bar\n\u2022 Ambiguity\n\u2022 Recursion\n\u2022 Transforma=ons Syntax\n\u2022 Any speaker of any human language can produce\nand understand an infinite number of possible\nsentences\n\u2022 Thus, we can\u2019t possibly have a mental dictionary\nof all the possible sentences\n\u2022 Rather, we have the rules for forming sentences\nstored in our brains\n\u2013 Syntax is the part of grammar that pertains to a\nspeaker\u2019s knowledge of sentences and their structures What the Syntax Rules Do\n\u2022 The rules of syntax combine words into phrases\nand phrases into sentences\n\u2022 They specify the correct word order for a language\n\u2013 For example, English is a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)\nlanguage\n\u2022 The President nominated a new Supreme Court justice\n\u2022 *President the new Supreme justice Court a nominated\n\u2022 They also describe the relationship between the\nmeaning of a group of words and the arrangement\nof the words\n\u2013 I mean what I say vs. I say what I mean What the Syntax Rules Do\n\u2022 The rules of syntax also specify the grammatical relations of\na sentence, such as the subject and the direct object\n\u2013 Your dog chased my cat vs. My cat chased your dog\n\u2022 Syntax rules specify constraints on sentences based on the\nverb of the sentence\n*The boy found *Disa slept the baby\n*The boy found in the house Disa slept\nThe boy found the ball Disa slept\nsoundly\nZack believes Robert to be a gentleman\n*Zack believes to be a gentleman\nZack tries to be a gentleman\n*Zack tries Robert to be a gentleman What the Syntax Rules Do\n\u2022 Syntax rules also tell us how words form groups and are\nhierarchically ordered in a sentence\n\u201cThe captain ordered the old men and women off the ship\u201d\n\u2022 This sentence has two possible meanings:\n\u2013 1. The captain ordered the old men and the old women off the ship\n\u2013 2. The captain ordered the old men and the women of any age off the\nship\n\u2022 The meanings depend on how the words in the sentence are\ngrouped (specifically, to which words is the adjective \u2018old\u2019\napplied?)\n\u2013 1. The captain ordered the [old [men and women]] off the ship\n\u2013 2. The captain ordered the [old men] and [women] off the ship What the Syntax Rules Do\n\u2022 These groupings can be shown hierarchically in a tree\n\u2022 These trees reveal the structural ambiguity in the phrase \u201cold men\nand women\u201d\n\u2013 Each structure corresponds to a different meaning\n\u2022 Structurally ambiguous sentences can often be humorous:\n\u2013 Catcher: \u201cWatch out for this guy, he\u2019s a great fastball hitter.\u201d\n\u2013 Pitcher: \u201cNo problem. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ve got a great fastball.\u201d What Grammaticality\nIs Not Based On\n\u2022 Grammaticality is not based on prior\nexposure to a sentence\n\u2022 Grammaticality is not based on\nmeaningfulness\n\u2022 Grammaticality is not based on\ntruthfulness Sentence Structure\n\u2022 We could say that the sentence \u201cThe child\nfound the puppy\u201d is based on the\ntemplate:\nDet\u2014N\u2014V\u2014Det\u2014N\n\u2013 But this would imply that sentences are just\nstrings of words without internal structure\n\u2013 This sentence can actually be separated into\nseveral groups:\n\u2022 [the child] [found a puppy]\n\u2022 [the child] [found [a puppy]]\n\u2022 [[the] [child]] [[found] [[a] [puppy]] Sentence Structure\n\u2022 A tree diagram can be used to show\nthe hierarchy of the sentence:\nThe child found a puppy Constituents and\nConstituency Tests\n\u2022 Constituents are the natural groupings in a\nsentence\n\u2022 Tests for constituency include:\n\u2013 1. \u201cstand alone test\u201d: if a group of words can\nstand alone, they form a constituent\n\u2022 A: \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d\n\u2022 B: \u201cA puppy.\u201d\n\u2013 2. \u201creplacement by a pronoun\u201d: pronouns can\nreplace constituents\n\u2022 A: \u201cWhere did you find a puppy?\u201d\n\u2022 B: \u201cI found him in the park.\u201d Constituents and\nConstituency Tests\n\u2013 3. \u201cmove as a unit\u201d test: If a group of\nwords can be moved together, they are a\nconstituent\n\u2022 A: \u201cThe child found a puppy.\u201d ! \u201cA puppy\nwas found by the child.\u201d Constituents and\nConstituency Tests\n\u2022 Experimental evidence shows that people\nperceive sentences in groupings\ncorresponding to constituents\n\u2022 Every sentence has at least one constituent\nstructure\n\u2013 If a sentence has more than one constituent\nstructure, then it is ambiguous and each\nconstituent structure corresponds to a different\nmeaning Syntactic Categories\n\u2022 A syntactic category is a family of expressions that can substitute\nfor one another without loss of grammaticality\nThe child found a puppy. The child found a puppy.\nA police officer found a puppy. The child ate the cake.\nYour neighbor found a puppy. The child slept.\n\u2022 All the underlined groups constitute a syntactic category known as a\nnoun phrase (NP)\n\u2013 NPs may be a subject or an object of a sentence, may contain a\ndeterminer, proper name, pronoun, or may be a noun alone\n\u2022 All the bolded groups constitute a syntactic category known as a\nverb phrase (VP)\n\u2013 VPs must always contain a verb but may also contain other constituents\nsuch as a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase (PP) Syntactic Categories\n\u2022 Phrasal categories: NP, VP, PP, AdjP, AdvP\n\u2022 Lexical categories:\n\u2013 Noun: puppy, girl, soup, happiness, pillow\n\u2013 Verb: find, run, sleep, realize, see, want\n\u2013 Preposition: up, down, across, into, from, with\n\u2013 Adjective: red, big, candid, lucky, large\n\u2013 Adverb: again, carefully, luckily, very, fairly\n\u2022 Functional categories:\n\u2013 Auxiliary: verbs such as have, and be, and modals such as may,\ncan, will, shall, must\n\u2013 Determiners: the, a, this, that, those, each, every Phrase Structure Trees\n\u2022 The core of every phrase is its head\n\u2013 In the VP walk the pugs, the verb walk is the head\n\u2022 The phrasal category that may occur next to a head\nand elaborates on the meaning of the head is a\ncomplement\n\u2013 In the PP over the river, the NP the river is the\ncomplement\n\u2022 Elements preceding the head are specifiers\n\u2013 In the NP the fish, the determiner the is the specifier Phrase Structure Trees\n\u2022 The internal structure of phrasal\ncategories can be captured using the\nX-bar schema: examples\nThe subject will later in\nSpec-T\nThis should be A Phrase Structure Trees\nPhrase structure (PS) trees show the\ninternal structure of a sentence along with\nsyntactic category information: Phrase Structure Trees\n\u2022 In a PS tree, every higher node dominates all the categories beneath it\n\u2013 S dominates everything\n\u2022 A node immediately dominates\nthe categories directly below it\n\u2022 Sisters are categories that are immediately dominated by the same node\n\u2013 The V and the NP are sisters Phrase Structure Trees:\nSelection\n\u2022 Some heads require a certain type of complement\nand some don\u2019t\n\u2013 The verb find requires an NP: Alex found the ball.\n\u2013 The verb put requires both an NP and a PP: Alex put the\nball in the toy box.\n\u2013 The verb sleep cannot take a complement: Alex slept.\n\u2013 The noun belief optionally selects a PP: the belief in\nfreedom of speech.\n\u2013 The adjective proud optionally selects a PP: proud of\nherself\n\u2022 C-selection or subcategorization refers to the\ninformation about what types of complements a\nhead can or must take Phrase Structure Trees:\nSelection\n\u2022 Verbs also select subjects and complements based\non semantic properties (S-selection)\n\u2013 The verb murder requires a human subject and object\n!The beer murdered the lamp.\n\u2013 The verb drink requires its subject to be animate and its optional\ncomplement object to be liquid\n!The beer drank the lamp.\n\u2022 For a sentence to be well-formed, it must conform\nto the structural constraints of PS rules and must\nalso obey the syntactic (C-selection) and semantic\n(S-selection) requirements of the head of each\nphrase Building Phrase Structure Trees\n\u2022 Phrase structure rules specify the\nwell-formed structures of a sentence\n\u2013 A tree must match the phrase structure\nrules to be grammatical Building Phrase Structure Trees\nThe majority of the senate became afraid of the vice\npresident.\nN\n(9)\nCorrections to the\ntextbook typos are in\nred. Building Phrase Structure Trees\nThe majority of the senate became afraid of the vice\npresident. The Infinity of Language:\nRecursive Rules\n\u2022 Recursive rules are rules in which a phrasal category can contain\nitself\n\u2022 Recursive rules allow a grammar to generate an infinite number of\nsentences\n\u2013 the kindhearted, intelligent,\nhandsome, \u2026 boy What Heads the Sentence\n\u2022 All sentences contain information about tense\u2014\nwhen a certain event or state of affairs occurred, so\nwe can say that Tense is the head of a sentence\n\u2013 So sentences are TPs, with T representing tense markers\nand modals What Heads the Sentence\nThe girl may cry. The child ate. Structural Ambiguities\n\u2022 The following sentence has two meanings:\nThe boy saw the man with the telescope.\n\u2022 The meanings are:\n\u2013 1. The boy used the telescope to see the man\n\u2013 2. The boy saw the man who had a telescope\n\u2022 Each of these meanings can be represented by a different\nphrase structure tree\n\u2013 The two interpretations are possible because the PS rules allow\nmore than one structure for the same string of words Structural Ambiguities\n\u2022 The boy saw the man\n\u2022 The boy used a who had a telescope\ntelescope to see the\nman More Structures\n\u2022 Adverbs are modifiers that can specify how (quickly, slowly)\nand when (yesterday, oNen) an event happens\n17. V ! AdvP V 16. V ! V AdvP Transformational Analysis\n\u2022 Recognizing that some sentences are related to each other is\nanother part of our syntactic competence\nThe boy is sleeping. Is the boy sleeping?\n\u2022 The first sentence is a declarative sentence, meaning that it\nasserts that a particular situation exists\n\u2022 The second sentence is a yes-no question, meaning that\nasks for confirmation of a situation\n\u2022 The difference in meaning is indicated by different word\norders, which means that certain structural differences\ncorrespond to certain meaning differences\n\u2013 For these sentences, the difference lies in where the auxiliary\noccurs in the sentence Transformational Rules\n\u2022 Yes-no questions are generated in\ntwo steps:\n\u2013 1. The PS rules generate a declarative\nsentence which represents the basic\nstructure, or deep structure (d-\nstructure) of the sentence\n\u2013 2. A transformational rule then moves\nthe auxiliary before the subject to create\nthe surface structure (s-structure) Transformational Rules\n\u2022 Other sentence pairs that involve\ntransformational rules are:\n\u2013 Active to passive\n\u2022 The cat chased the mouse. ! The mouse was chased\nby the cat.\n\u2013 there sentences\n\u2022 There was a man on the roof. ! A man was on the\nroof.\n\u2013 PP preposing\n\u2022 The astronomer saw the quasar with the telescope. !\nWith the telescope, the astronomer saw the quasar. The Structural Dependency of Rules\n\u2022 Transformations are structure-dependent, which\nmeans they act on phrase structures without caring\nwhat words are in the structures\n\u2013 The Move rule can be applied to any PP as long as it is an\nadjunct to V.\n\u2013 Subject-verb agreement stretches across all structures\nbetween the subject and the verb: Yes\/No\n\u2022 The forma=on of yes-\u00ad\u2010no ques=ons comes from\nthe transforma=on Move reloca=ng the T from\nthe corresponding declara=ve sentence:\n\u2022 The boy will sleep will the boy ___ sleep C takes TP\n\u2022 C takes TP as its complement, C can\nhave Q feature, but not always Embedded CP\u2019s\n\u2022 CP\u2019s are needed not just for ques=ons:\n\u2013 belief that iron floats (NP complement)\n\u2013 wonders if iron floats (VP complement)\n\u2013 happy that iron floats (AP complement)\n\u2013 about whether iron will sink (PP complement) Examples of embedded CP Yes\/No ques=ons T-\u00ad\u2010>C Wh Questions\nExample: What will Max chase?\n\u2022 This Wh ques=on is formed in three steps:\n\u2013 1. The PS rules generate a basic declara=ve word order:\nMax will chase what?\n\u2013 2. Move shiNs the word what to the beginning of the\nsentence: What Max will chase?\n\u2013 3. Move shiNs the modal will to occur before the subject\nNP: What will Max chase? Wh-\u00ad\u2010deriva=on Wh-\u00ad\u2010movement Do-\u00ad\u2010inser=on\n\u2022 Which toys does Pete like Modals\/ Auxiliaries\n1. Spot has chased a squirrel.\n2. Nellie is snoring.\n\u2022 Like the modals, the auxiliaries have and be move to the posi=on\npreceding the subject in both yes-\u00ad\u2010no ques=ons and wh ques=ons.\n3. Has Spot ____ chased a squirrel?\n4. Is Nellie ____ snoring?\n5. What has Spot ____ chased ____?\n\u2022 The ques=on is: where do have and be originate in the d-\u00ad\u2010structure?\n\u2022 Note that have and be can occur in the same sentence with a modal:\n\u2013 Nellie may be snoring.\n\u2013 Spot must have found a squirrel. recursive v\n\u2022 Our analysis leads us to conclude that have\/\nbe originate under V in a recursive Vd\nstructure,as follows. Tense\/Modal\n\u2022 When there is no modal, T is occupied by a\ntense feature, which is realized on have\/be, as\nwould be the case for other verbs like snore: Movement from V-\u00ad\u2010>T-\u00ad\u2010>C\n\u2022 What has Spot chased?\n\u2022 Here is the d-\u00ad\u2010structure (from the X-\u00ad\u2010bar derived phrase\nstructure rules): V-\u00ad\u2010>T T-\u00ad\u2010>C Wh-\u00ad\u2010move\n\u2022 We see that V-\u00ad\u2010>T feeds T-\u00ad\u2010>C, which allows wh\nmove.
