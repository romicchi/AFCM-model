Many natural dualities, such as life and death, light and\ndark, are thought of as physical manifestations of the concept.\nYin and yang can also be thought of as complementary forces\ninteracting to form a dynamic system in which the whole is\ngreater than the parts. In information design, theory and prac-\ntice is an example where the whole is greater than the parts.\nIn this book drawings and photos are my own, unless other\ninformation.\nISBN 978-91-85334-29-2\n\u00a9 Rune Pettersson\nTullinge 2015\n2 Preface\nInformation design is a multi-disciplinary, multi-dimensional,\nand worldwide consideration with influences from areas such as\nlanguage, art and aesthetics, information, communication, be-\nhaviour and cognition, business and law, as well as media pro-\nduction technologies.\nSince my retirement I have edited and revised sections of\nmy earlier books, conference papers and reports about informa-\ntion design, message design, visual communication and visual\nliteracy.

We see the results of graphic\ndesign every day in books, magazines, packages, papers, post-\ners, symbols, and many other products.\nGraphic design\nA generally accepted view is that graphic design may be de-\nscribed as the art and craft of bringing a functional, aesthetic,\nand organized structure to different kinds of texts and illustra-\ntions. Graphic design is a process (verb) as well as a result\n(noun) of that process. Traditional graphic design is a kind of\n\u201call purpose-design\u201d used in the production of various media.\nModern visual graphic design has its roots in the rational, func-\ntional aesthetics that evolved in traditional graphic design over\nthe centuries for the print media, and are now used in industrial\ndesign, as well as in architecture.\nPurpose for graphic design\nThe purpose of work with graphic design is to find a suitable\npresentation of the message with respect to the intended re-\nceiver, medium, and economical situation. A well-designed\nbook appears as a \u201dunified whole.\u201d All design elements serve to\nenhance the content.\nMelin (1999, 2011) found that it is more likely that graphi-\ncally complex texts will be read than \u201cplain\u201d texts. And it takes\nless time to read a graphically complex text than a \u201cplain\u201d text.\nReaders often react in a positive way to texts with good ty-\npography and good illustrations. The overall visual look shapes\n8 users\u2019 perceptions of consistency and user satisfaction in brows-\ning tasks (Ozok & Salvendy, 2000).\nWithin a given area, such as a page in a book, a computer\nscreen, or a projected image, we may alter the presentation of\ntext (headings, running text, captions, lists), pictures, tables,\nand the background (margins, ornaments, page number, space).\nWhen text and graphics are organised into meaningful se-\nmantic clusters, this makes it easier for readers to chunk the\ncontent (Kahn, Tan & Beaton, 1990). Visual grouping of text\nenables readers get a sense of the overall structure (Tullis,\n1997), and help readers remember content (Niemela & Saari-\nnen, 2000). How the content is grouped may influence the\nreaders\u2019 first impressions of the content (Lindgaard et al.,\n2006). Readers will better remember the content and make\nfewer errors. Careful integration of words and pictures engage\npeople more effectively than words or pictures alone (Sadoski &\nPaivio, 2001).\nProducers of information and learning materials can facili-\ntate communication, and the learning processes of the readers.\nComplicated language, in both texts and pictures, will impair\nthe understanding of the message. Active voice, clarity, com-\nprehensibility, consistency, legibility, precision, readability,\nreading value, simplicity, and structure are the key concepts in\ninformation design. Hiebert (1998) saw graphic design as inter-\nface design (p. 9):\nIn the largest sense, all graphic design serves as an inter-\nface. It is the filter that facilitates communication between\nusers and products, places, processes, information, and\nservices. This interface may have the purpose of description\nor persuasion. It may be in a process of one-way presenta-\n9 tion or two-way discourse (interactive). It has a functional\nrather than a decorative purpose.\nThe role of graphic design is functional. According to Bull\n(1999) there are currently many debates as to what the role of a\ndesigner is. Terms like \u201cVisual Communicator\u201d and \u201cInforma-\ntion Architect\u201d have arose. Many of these debates have grown\nout of many designers\u2019 misuse of technology and the computer.\nBull concluded (p. 54):\nIn our fast-paced, drive-thru oriented society, the graphic\ndesign community often suffers from the public perception\nof what I have coined the \u2018Kinko\u2019s Mentality\u2019. This is where\nanyone with a computer is legitimized as a designer and so-\nlutions to your problem can be given form based on a solu-\ntion to another problem. And of course, it all perpetuates\nthe idea of the designer as just someone who just dresses\nthings up.\nThe study of rational, functional aesthetics, as well as effective\nand efficient layouts for all media makes graphic design inter-\nesting for information design scholars. Graphic design is a tool\nwith which we can manipulate the raw materials \u2013 words in dif-\nferent typefaces, sizes, styles, empty space, illustrations, colour,\npaper and ink, and the final number of pages \u2013 to achieve the\nbest possible communications between people.\nWaller (1980) provided a list of codifying rules for graphic\nlanguage and functions of the typographic organization of text\nin a book. Waller discussed two main categories (I) Rhetorical\nfunctions, and (II) Access functions (p. 246):\nI. Rhetorical functions\n1. About the argument.\n10 \u2013 Summarization (title, summary).\n\u2013 Introduction (foreword, preface, introduction).\n2. Within the argument\n\u2013 Emphasis (underlining, italics, etc.).\n\u2013 Transition (headings, space, etc.).\n\u2013 Bifurcation (alternative options, parallel texts, interpola-\ntion sections).\n3. Extra to the argument\n\u2013 Substantiation (footnotes, appendices, references).\n\u2013 Addenda (apologia, acknowledgements, etc.).\nII. Access functions\n4. About the book.\n\u2013 Overviews (contents list, abstract).\n\u2013 Definitives (glossary, index).\n\u2013 Identifiers (title, author, style).\n5. Within the book.\n\u2013 Locators (topical headings, typographic signalling).\n\u2013 Descriptors (functional headings, captions).\n6. Extra to the book.\n\u2013 Study guidance (recommended reading, exercises).\nGraphic design objectives\nAny graphical message should be legible for the intended audi-\nence. (It should also be readable, and well worth reading.) In\ngraphic design the main objective is to provide functional, aes-\nthetic, and organised structure to all kinds of information sets.\nThe intended individual information interpreters might be seen\nas \u201creaders.\u201d They may develop new views, relaxation, emo-\ntions, awareness, attention, and understanding. In the writing\nof graphic design objectives it may be an advantage to use verbs\n11 like find, identify, read, and recognise. These verbs all denote\nobservable behaviour. A few examples of performance objec-\ntives in graphic design may be:\n\u2022 For a table: 100% of the users should be able to find the time\nfor departure of the train to x.\n\u2022 For a package: 100% of the buyers should be able to read the\ntext on the package without any difficulty.\n\u2022 For a non-fiction book: 100% of the readers should be able\nto read the text in the book without any difficulty.\n\u2022 For a logotype: 60% of the readers should be able to identify\na new logotype within six weeks.\nOf course we have to decide the actual numbers, with respect to\npercent and allowed time, in each specific case.\nGraphic design processes\nAround 1850 the sculptor Horatio Greenough wrote, \u201cform fol-\nlows function\u201d. The architect Louis Sullivan made this phrase\nfamous in 1896. However, Mijksenaar and Westendorp (1999,\np. 34) concluded that architects, engineers and designers rarely\nfollow this rule. Many theories of design processes may have\nbeen devised with three-dimensional products in mind. How-\never Adams (1999, p. 4) argued that there is no reason not to\napply these design processes to their two-dimensional relatives.\nSome examples of design processes\nSeveral processes for problem solving are related to design. For\nexample Shadrin (1992:29) discussed problem solving based on\nthe following seven steps or \u201cconstants\u201d as a system for problem\nsolving:\n\u2022 Design activity (What is the problem?)\n12 \u2022 Analysis (What is the purpose and function of the design?)\n\u2022 Historical reference (How was it done before?)\n\u2022 Visual communication (How can I communicate my idea?)\n\u2022 Skills (What skills do I need for this design?)\n\u2022 Technology (How will the design or product be made?)\n\u2022 Evaluation (Is this the best solution I can come up with?)\nRoozenburg and Eekels (1995) presented a design process with\nerror elimination step by step. They noted the following steps:\n\u2022 Problem definition\n\u2022 Analysis\n\u2022 Criteria\n\u2022 Synthesis\n\u2022 Preliminary design\n\u2022 Simulation\n\u2022 Expected properties\n\u2022 Evaluation (based on Criteria)\n\u2022 Value of the design\n\u2022 Decision (feedback to Synthesis and Analysis)\n\u2022 Acceptable design\nRoozenburg and Eekels stress the development of criteria to be\nused in judging the success of a resulting design. The function-\ning of a potential design solution is assessed in a simulation.\nThe observed properties of the assessed solution are used to\ninfer the properties that we may expect from the final product.\nBull (1999) noted the following steps in a graphic design process\n(p. 53):\n\u2022 Problem definition.\n\u2022 Research.\n\u2022 Conceptualization.\n13 \u2022 Prototyping.\n\u2022 Testing.\n\u2022 Implementation.\n\u2022 Documentation.\nAdams (1999, p. 4) described how the writer and the designer\nare working together in some manner using a mental model of\nthe user and of the way in which the communication will be\nused. Within this mental model words, verbal structures, pos-\nsibly illustrative pictures, and indeed the whole design concept\nare constructed. When the user approaches an information pro-\nduct, he or she brings a history of interaction with that type of\ninformation product. The user will be of a social and cultural\nbackground, will have a certain education and ability level and\nwill have a certain motivation regarding the use of the product.\nR1 R2 R3 R4\nC P1 1 P2 2 P3 3 P4 4 5\nThe creative message and information design processes in-\nclude four different production (P) and review activities (R).\nThe production activities are analysis and production (P1) of\nsynopsis (1), production (P2) of draft (2), production (P3) of\nscript (3), and production (P4) of original 4) and master (5). C\n= commission.\nMy own \u201cmessage design and information design model\u201d\nincludes the following four process activities: analysis and syn-\nopsis, production of draft, production of script, and production\n14 of original and master. Each activity includes a design sub-\nprocess, activity documentation, and a review process. Main\nmessage design tools will include text (printed and spoken),\nsymbols, pictures (drawings and photos), typography and lay-\nout, light and light effects, sound and sound effects.\nOften a team of people with skills in the different areas are\nworking together in a design team. The task may be too over-\nwhelming for a single person.\n(See the book Information Design 1\u2013Message Design.)\nReduction\nAccording to Mullet and Sano (1995, p. 38) the most fundamen-\ntal design technique is reduction. Wherever possible the de-\nsigner should remove insignificant elements in layout, pictures,\nand texts in order for significant design elements to be clearly\nnoticed. An elegant design must be reduced to its essential ele-\nments and each element reduced to its essential form. As an\nexample a good symbol for a sign is simple and clear. It has an\noptimal colour, dimension, form, and size (Barlow & Wogalter,\n1991; Dewar, 1999; Wogalter, 1999).\nA text on a poster, and on a screen, shall be bold enough\n(Mayer, 1993; Ormrod, 1989; Pettersson, 1993; Wileman, 1993),\nand large enough (Ormrod, 1989; Pettersson, 1993; Wileman,\n1993). Too small or too large lettering will impair reading. The\ntext shall also have good readability (e.g. Kirkman, 2003, 2005;\nKlare, 1985; Lipton, 2007; Mackiewicz, 2004; Pettersson, 1989;\nYoung, 1989).\nIt is generally accepted that good design is simple, bold,\nand direct. It ensures that significant design elements will be\nnoticed by removing insignificant elements wherever possible.\nMost people read instructional materials selectively. Readers\n15 rarely, if ever, begin at the beginning and read straight through\nto the end. Usually we use a combination of browsing, reading\nheadings, looking at illustrations and captions, reading certain\nparts carefully, skimming others, and avoiding some parts com-\npletely.\nInformation layout\nInformation layout differs from a decoration layout, in which\npurely aesthetic aspects dominate. When illustrations in text-\nbooks are not relevant to the prose contents, they do not facili-\ntate understanding. On the contrary, illustrations can actually\nhave a negative effect on reading comprehension and prose\nlearning. Therefore illustrations should not be used only for\ndecoration in information and learning materials. (See the sec-\ntion Image functions in teaching and learning in the book In-\nformation Design 3\u2013Image Design.)\nToday many visuals are too complicated and would com-\nmunicate better if designers valued simplicity over decoration.\nAesthetically pleasing visuals may deceive the learners about\ntheir instructional values. There are many situations where col-\nour and typographic elements can be used for decoration. How-\never, a decorative use of colour or typography should never be\nmixed with the intended use to provide clear structure, sim-\nplicity and hierarchy. It must always be very clear and easy for\nthe receiver to understand when colour and typography are\nused for decoration and when the use is meant to have some\ncognitive importance.\n16 History of graphic design\nPeople have been designing, planning and executing informa-\ntion sets, information materials, and messages in all times. Mul-\nlet and Sano (1995, p. 9) noted that whereas art strives to ex-\npress fundamental ideas and perspectives on the human condi-\ntion, design is concerned with finding the representation best\nsuited to the communication of specific information.\nThe Egyptians were the first culture to produce illustrated\nmanuscripts and wall decorations that combined their writing\nsystem with illustrations. In the fifth century, the Greeks intro-\nduced the concept of symmetry. This was based on their obser-\nvations about the natural world. Later, Roman artists developed\nsymmetric arrangements of letters and graphic elements. For\ncenturies monks produced hand-drawn manuscripts in their\nmonasteries. They paid careful attention to the selection and\nplacement of each graphic element, and they tried to maintain a\nconsistent style throughout every single work.\nStep by step\nWith the invention of the printing press the publisher or art di-\nrector employed assistants to design typefaces for good legi-\nbility and high aesthetic value (Meggs, 2005). At this point,\nmore care could be given to typography, illustrations and\ngraphic design. Book pages were often decorated with borders\nand various kinds of ornaments as natural parts of the final de-\nsign. Artistic and aesthetic values of each historical period have\nbeen dominating in traditional graphic design.\nSince the time of Gutenberg graphic design has developed\nas new printing devices were invented. For centuries words and\npictures were separated by less developed technology. There\n17 was no method to print text and pictures together with good\nquality until the lithographic process was invented.\nOriginally all lithographs were printed from a flat, litho-\ngraphic limestone on a flatbed press. The image and the text are\ndrawn on the flat surface of the stone with a greasy crayon, an\noily wash, or with India ink. After a chemical treatment the\nparts of the stone without the image and text elements are sus-\nceptible to water. The printing ink is transferred to the paper\nfrom the surface with the image and the text. Lithography was\ninvented in 1798 and has been used for printing of lithographic\nart, but also posters, placards, cards, advertisements, etc.\nBy 1834 specially treated zinc plates began to replace the\nheavy stones. From 1860 to 1900, lithography was commonly\nused for art reproductions, posters, greeting cards, and business\ncards. The use of photomechanical metal plates in the early\n1900s made the technique of hand transferring from stones ob-\nsolete. Lithography expanded the range of graphic design.\nWith the invention of the half-tone screen it was possible to\nprint photographs as half-tone pictures. This information is\nconverted to the raster-dots that are employed in the printing of\nthe picture. The printed dots vary in size from nothing or a very\nsmall dot to gradually increasing dot-sizes. Smaller dots give the\nimpression of light grey areas in the image, and larger dots give\nthe impression of darker tones. The number of raster-dots de-\nfines the quality of the final printed image.\nThe first colour photographs were reproduced in 1881. Ad-\nvances in photoengraving and halftone techniques allowed the\nregular use of photographs in print media by World War I. Be-\ncause of the modern computer the methods for presenting\nphotographs are changing radically. Halftone screens can now\n18 be simulated with computer programmes that sidestep the en-\ntire photoengraving process.\nToday the graphic designer has even more freedom than the\nmonks during the Middle Ages. Now, it is possible to combine\nwords and pictures at will, in effective and efficient layouts for\nall media. Modern visual graphic design has its roots in the ra-\ntional, functional aesthetics that evolved in traditional graphic\ndesign over the centuries for the print media, and in industrial\ndesign, as well as architecture.\nAccording to Baggerman (2000, p. 9) possibly the most im-\nportant thing to keep in mind is that there\u2019s no recipe that\u2019s\ngoing to make your design appropriate for all applications and\nusers. It helps to think of any designed piece as an interface, be\nit a book, shampoo bottle, retail store, or Web site.\nModern graphic design\nToday graphic designers work in \u201cpersuasion design,\u201d as well as\nin \u201cinstruction design,\u201d and in \u201cinformation design.\u201d Graphic\ndesign is a natural part of these design areas. Graphic designers\nare responsible for typography and layout in information and\nlearning sets. The graphic designers may also produce the final\nmaster for printing.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century avant-garde de-\nsigners, from the modern art movement, found inspiration from\nefficient, functional, interesting, and powerful new machinery.\nThe avant-garde designers used visual forms that were fitting\nfor the new and modern world. They explored asymmetrical\nlayout, functionalism, geometric typefaces, hierarchy, mini-\nmalism, serial design, universality, and white \u201cempty\u201d space.\nModern graphic design emerged out of the modern art move-\nment.\n19 The history of graphic design reveals that the manipulation\nof visual structure has always been fundamental to our thinking\nabout how communication works (Davis, 2012, p. 22). During\nseveral decades graphic design was gradually consolidated into\na design profession. The theoretical base for graphic design was\ndeveloped from avant-garde movements such as the Russian\nartistic and architectural philosophy Constructivism, the Dutch\nartistic movement de Stijl, and the German school Bauhaus that\ncombined crafts and fine arts. Bauhaus was famous for the new\napproach to design. After World War II many art schools\nworked with influences from these early movements and prac-\ntices. In the middle of the twentieth century graphic design be-\ncame a profession in its own right.\nDesign scholars like Gy\u00f6rgy Kepes (1944), Rudolf Arnheim\n(1954), and Donis Dondis (1973) wrote textbooks with design\nprinciples based on abstract painting and Gestalt psychology.\nAll of them have a focus on visual perception. For these authors\ndesign is an abstract and formal activity. A theory of design that\nisolates visual perception from linguistic interpretation encour-\nages indifference to cultural meaning (Lupton & Miller, 1999, p.\n62).\nKepes (1944) argued that visual communication is universal\nand international. Visual communication knows no limits of\ntongue, vocabulary, or grammar. This book was used as a col-\nlege textbook, and had thirteen printings, in four languages.\nArnheim (1954) described picture perception as a matter of\nresponding to basic forms such as gestalt laws. An important\npoint is that visual perception includes the same behaviours\nthat we commonly consider only as matters of cognition or\nthinking.\n20 Dondis (1973) discussed the use of several pairs of opposi-\ntions as techniques for visual communication. A few examples\nare: Balance \u2013 Instability, Simplicity \u2013 Complexity, and Trans-\nparency \u2013 Opacity. These oppositions present the graphic de-\nsigner with effective means of making expressive visual com-\nmunication.\nFrom the 1950s/1960s graphic designers abandoned the\nold avant-garde ideals, and used formal methods. They worked\nwith restricted typography in layouts based on strict grids. The\nnew International Typographical Style, also known as the\nSwiss Style, favoured values of asymmetric layouts, cleanliness,\nlegibility, neutrality, objectivity, photographs rather than draw-\nings, rationality, and sans-serif typefaces.\nAccording to Horn (1999, p. 25\u201326) information design is\nexperiencing a variety of tensions. Graphic designers \u201clearn in\nart school to worship the gods of Style and Fashion, Novelty,\nImpact and Self-expression.\u201d Technical communication people\n\u201cworship the gods of Clarity, Precision, Legibility, Comprehen-\nsibility, and (often) Simplicity.\u201d\nIn the book \u201cGraphic design theory Readings from the\nfield\u201d (Armstrong, 2009) twenty-four graphic designers ex-\nplores the aesthetic and social purposes of design practice.\nThese authors present what they think about what they experi-\nence is going on in the world of design discourse. Topics range\nfrom Bauhaus, over postmodernism and social responsibility, to\nInternet.\nArmstrong (2009, p. 97) noted that digital technology\nfundamentally transformed graphic design \u201cas one millennium\nended and another began.\u201d The old avant-garde issues of\nauthorship, social responsibility, and universality were reborn\nwithin society\u2019s newly decentralized network structure. In-\n21 dustry-standard software and restrictive web protocols formed\na new universal graphic language, while the subjective shift ex-\npressed in New Wave and postmodern design instilled a revived\nsense of agency among designers.\nProviding clarity, providing emphasis, and providing\nunity are three of the Functional principles in information de-\nsign (Pettersson, 2010). Information materials should be as\nclear, simple, unambiguous and transparent as possible. We\nshould avoid unusual typefaces, as well as fonts that are too\nsmall or too large. Typeface and font size must be adapted to\nmeet the limitations of the medium, and the technical produc-\ntion. The most important elements in an information material\nmay be emphasized to enhance attention and perception. Em-\nphasis may be used to attract, direct and keep attention. Infor-\nmation materials should have an \u201coverall coherence and to-\ngetherness.\u201d Inconsistencies in information materials may con-\nfuse the receivers.\nResearch-based design\nAccording to Lester (1995, p. 168) the designer W. A. Dwiggins\nwas the first to use the term graphic design. This was in 1922.\nDuring his career he worked on more than 300 book designs.\nAlthough we may not think about it, the practice of graphic de-\nsign is as old as recorded history, and we see the results of\ngraphic design every day. We see books, cards, exhibitions,\nmagazines, newsletters, packages, papers, posters, signs, tick-\nets, and many other products. Often graphic design is thought\nof with regard only to the print medium, but it is also used in\nseveral other media. Hurlburt (1981, p. 22) defined graphic de-\nsign in the following way: \u201cGraphic design is an umbrella term\nthat covers a broad range of printed and projected images. Its\n22 three principal functions are to persuade, to identify, and to in-\nform.\u201d\nAdvertising is generally regarded as the means for persua-\nsion, although at times its purpose may also be to identify or to\ninform. Corporate identification focus on identity, but corporate\nliterature will often inform, and corporate advertising may also\nhave a persuasive purpose. In package design the function is\nalso to protect the content in the package.\nHightower (1989, p. 7) noted that graphic design is a ubi-\nquitous presence in our daily lives that can engage and inform\nus or simply add to the visual morass of contemporary culture.\nImportant and unimportant messages are graphically com-\nmunicated throughout the day.\nAccording to Friedman (1989, p. 10) the taint of commerce\nhas relegated graphic design to the status of \u201csecond class\u201d dis-\ncipline in the academic realm. In order to better this low status,\nthe discipline needs to adopt more theory. However, at present\nthere seems to be few theoretical foundations for graphic de-\nsign. Much of the work is apparently based on intuition, and\nsome on fundamental principles.\nAccording to Zwaga, Boersma and Hoonhout (1999, p. xix)\nresearchers active in a field of applied behavioural science im-\nplicitly expect that designers concerned with the usability of\ntheir products will eagerly pick up the fruits of scientific investi-\ngation and use them in their designs.\nMany guideline documents have been published over the\nyears. However, to the disappointment of ergonomists and be-\nhavioural scientists designers do not read their handbooks, or\ntheir scientific journals, and they are not prepared to apply ex-\nperimental data to their work. Often designers are not even\naware that this guideline information exists. The efforts were\n23 wasted because they did not understand what designing was all\nabout. However, Dillon (1994) found that designers seek further\nguidelines and usability standards, and that they are prepared\nto apply guideline information.\nAdams (1999, p. 19) concluded that designing of good in-\nformation-giving material is a difficult task, but it is one that\ncan be assisted greatly by appropriate usability testing. Wogal-\nter (1999) noted that if the testing shows that a number of peo-\nple do not understand the message, or worse, misunderstand it,\nthen the material must be redesigned and tested again \u2013 until it\nis understood by the intended audience. Users of information\nproducts still largely blame themselves when faced with poor\ndesign of any kind. Thus a push for research-based information\ndesign must come from the information designers. In each case\nmembers of the specific user group may be invited to evaluate\npreliminary texts and sketches for drawings and photographs.\n24 Aesthetic principles\nAesthetics is usually regarded as a branch of philosophy, along\nwith epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics. It is the\nyoungest branch of philosophy with its own name. Aesthetics\nimplies a hierarchical judgement in which the elements of any\ncompositions, and their organisations, are considered more or\nless appealing to the senses by virtue of their ability to create\nhigher emotional, intellectual, or moral appreciations in people.\nThe group \u201cAesthetic principles\u201d is one of the four groups of\nmessage design principles. This section includes Aesthetic pro-\nportion principle, and Harmony principle.\nAesthetic proportion principle\nBasically proportion is a mathematical concept. However, the\nconcept aesthetic proportion principle is very much a subjective\nconcept. It is related to the appropriate and pleasing relations\nbetween elements in information and learning materials. Aes-\nthetic proportion deals with aesthetic aspects of information\nsets.\nWe may all have different ideas of what we find beautiful\nand rewarding, and what we find boring, disturbing, distracting\nor ugly. When a design is out of proportion it is lacking appro-\npriate relations. It may be disproportionate, exaggerated or\noveremphasized. Aesthetic designs are perceived as easier to\nuse than less-aesthetic designs (Lidwell et al., 2010, p. 20). The\ninformation designer may:\n\u2022 Find out receiver preferences of aesthetic proportions.\n\u2022 Be careful using proportions according to the \u201cgolden sec-\ntion.\u201d\n25 \u2022 Never mix a decorative use of colour with cognitive import-\nance.\nThis section includes the following two sub-sections 1) fine art,\nand 2) information aesthetics.\nFine art\nThroughout history all cultures have produced musical, verbal\nas well as visual art. Fine art is usually assumed to mean the\nvisual arts, like architecture, painting, and sculpture. The im-\npulse to create, to recognise and to generate order, seems to be\nuniversal.\nDifferent reasons\nOne of the earliest human artistic acts was to spend more time\nshaping tools than was functionally necessary. Palaeolithic\nNeanderthal man carefully decorated their spearheads. Some\ntheorists argue that the origin of human creativity can be found\nin these early crafts of making tools and weapons.\nThroughout history people have produced art for different\nreasons, such as religious devotions, special commemorations,\nadornments, and also for personal expressions. Art has also\nbeen created on many scales, from huge buildings and monu-\nments, large murals and paintings to small jewellery and minia-\nture paintings. The broadest generalisation may be that the\nvisual arts are spatial rather than temporal. Music and literature\nmust be experienced serially in time. The visual arts must be\nexperienced in space. Space is an illusion in painting. Here an\nindication of three dimensions in two dimensions is rendered\nby conventions.\nHowever, the conventions vary during different periods and\nin different places. In many situations it is not at all possible to\n26 \u201cunderstand the meaning of fine art.\u201d To some degree, the phys-\nical materials that artists use will influence the properties of the\nresulting artwork. As an example, a fresco painting on a wall has\nvisual properties that are different from the properties of an oil\npainting on canvas.\nDivine proportion\nIn fine art classical formats are based on the divine proportion\nor the principle of the golden ratio. This is an irrational number\nis calculated from a line that is divided into two segments in a\ncertain way. The ratio of a line (a+b) to the larger segment (a) is\nthe same as the larger segment (a) is to the shorter segment (b).\nThus (a+b)/a = a/b (Livio, 2002, p. 3).\na b\nAccording to the Divine Proportion (a+b) is to a as a to b.\nThis mathematical relationship forms an irrational number,\ni.e. a number that never ends. Around 300 B.C. Euclid of Alex-\nandria, in Egypt, provided the first mathematical definition of\nthe golden ratio (Livio, 2002, p. 3). (With ten decimals the\ngolden quota is 1.6180339887.) In the early 20th century the\nAmerican mathematician Mark Barr named this irrational\nnumber \u201cphi\u201d in honour of the Greek Sculptor Phidias (Livio,\n2002, p. 5). Historians believe that Phidias lived circa 490\u2013430\nB.C.\nThe principle of the golden ratio is comparable to the well-\nknown \u201cFibonacci numbers\u201d: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\nand so forth. In this sequence any term after the first two is the\nsum of the previous two terms. This property is a close ap-\n27 proximation of the golden quota (8/5 = 1.6). A golden rectangle\ntherefore has sides of approximately the same proportions, 8/5.\nAny such rectangle is enlarged by being multiplied by 1.62, and\nreduced by being multiplied by 0.62.\nTraditionally, the golden rectangle is considered aesthetic\nin the western world (Arnheim, 1974; Berndal & Frigyes, 1990;\nBringhurst, 2004; Koblanck, 1999; Moriarty, 1991; Pettersson,\n2002). For 2,500 years the principle of the golden ratio has\nbeen used in art and architecture to create harmonious propor-\ntions. The golden ratio is a well-known standard format for fine\nart, flags, symbols and more. During the nineteenth century the\ngolden ratio was much used in painting academies.\nWhen we divide a rectangle according to the golden ratio by\nadding a square, the rest of the original rectangle (the blue\nsurface) gets the golden ratio. In theory we can repeat this\nprocess forever; in reality though, there are always physical\nlimits to this.\nWhen diagonal lines are drawn in a pentagon, several exam-\nples of the golden ratio emerge. At the same time \u201cphi\u201d is the\nproperty between the diagonal and one side in the pentagon.\nThe five-point star is used in many ways.\n28 The aesthetic value of a message is how the intended re-\nceivers perceive it with respect to its beauty. Material with a\n(sufficiently) pleasing form has greater potential for conveying a\nparticular message than does non-aesthetic material. With the\ninvention of the printing press the publisher, or the art director,\nemployed assistants to create typefaces for good legibility and\nhigh aesthetic value. In this new situation, more care could be\ngiven to typography, illustrations, and layout. As previously\nnoted book pages were often decorated with borders and vari-\nous kinds of ornaments as natural parts of the final design. Ar-\ntistic and aesthetic values of each historical period have been\ndominating in traditional graphic design. Since the time of\nGutenberg the art and practice of graphic design has developed\nstep by step, as new printing devices were invented and intro-\nduced.\nAesthetically pleasing visuals may not be of great instruc-\ntional value. \u201cThe value of different types of visual illustrations\nis not a valid assessment of instructional effectiveness that is,\naesthetically pleasing visuals may not be of great instructional\nvalue\u201d (Dwyer & Dwyer, 1989, p. 122). It is, however, possible\nthat aesthetically pleasing information material will be noticed\nand used better than material without any aesthetic qualities\n(Holmes, 1993). Malamed (2009, p. 203) noted that when view-\ners look at both pleasant and unpleasant pictures, they consis-\ntently demonstrate an emotional reaction indicated by pro-\nnounced brain activity that does not occur when they look at\nneutral pictures.\n29 Information aesthetics\nNorman (2002) argued that visual attractiveness is important\nfor the cognitive domain since the affective domain is highly\nrelated to human cogitation.\nLidwell et al. (2010, p. 20) found that aesthetic designs are\nperceived as easier to use than less-aesthetic designs. Informa-\ntion aesthetics deal with aesthetic aspects of information sets.\nIn some situations art may be used for information, and infor-\nmation may in some situations be classified as art. A good ex-\nample of this is the brightly coloured posters designed by artists\nlike Jules Ch\u00e9ret (1836-1932), and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\n(1864-1901).\n(See the book Information Design 6\u2013Predecessors & Pio-\nneers.)\nCh\u00e9ret is often called both \u201cthe father of modern advertis-\ning\u201d and \u201cthe father of the poster\u201d. He produced about 1,200\nposters. Toulouse-Lautrec is often called \u201cthe king of posters\u201d. A\nregister of his complete works shows in all 350 lithographs, of\nwhich about 30 are posters. The 27-year-old Toulouse-Lautrec\nbecame famous over a night, when his poster \u201cMoulin Rouge:\nLa Goulue\u201d was put on walls and advertising pillars all over\nParis in October, 1891.Toulouse-Lautrec revolutionized the art\nof posters and gave the commercial poster the status as an in-\ndependent art form. Jules Ch\u00e9ret, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\nand many other artists who worked with commercial posters\ndid not follow the old principle of the Golden Ratio.\nA format index\nIt is difficult to compare pages and pictures, especially in differ-\nent media and in different sizes. To objectively compare formats\nof pages, papers, and different kinds of images and pictures I\n30 have developed a simple format index. It is calculated as the\nheight/width x 100. Regardless of the size of the individual arte-\nfacts all wide formats get index numbers below 100. All square\nformats get index 100, and all vertical formats get index values\nover 100.\nThe format index can be used to compare pages and sheets\nof paper (as a page format index, or a paper format index).\nWhen we use standard A-series papers horizontally they get\nindex 71. When we use the same papers vertically they get index\n141. When we use US-letter papers horizontally they get index\n77. When we use these papers vertically they get index 129.\n71 75\n65\n62\nGolden ratio Slide A4 PP\n129 141 162\n100\n78\nOH Square US-letter A4 Golden ratio\nThis illustration shows some index values.\nThe format index can be used to compare pictures and pro-\njected images (as a picture format index). The horizontal golden\nratio format has index 62, and the vertical golden ratio format\nhas 162. A projected slide has index 65, a PP 75, and an OH 78.\nThe image area on a horizontally held iPad Air2 has index 75,\nand when it is held vertically the index is 133.\n31 Study of book pages\nFor many years designers and fine artists have been using, and\nare still using, the proportions of the golden ratio in their work.\nIt can be used in paintings, page formats, or picture formats in\nprint products, e.g. in books. Furthermore, handbooks in ty-\npography and graphic design recommend the use of the golden\nratio. In her book Creative Advertising, Moriarty (1991, p. 237)\nnoted that:\nMost quality books and magazines use page sizes that are\nclose to a 3:5 ratio. The amount of type on the page relative\nto the overall page size is roughly 3:5. The proportions of\nthe page margins to the text area are also 3:5.\nThe Penguin publishing house has used the page format 111x180\nmm (3:4.9) for more than half a century (Bringhurst, 2004, p.\n157).\nIn order to study if, or and to what degree, the golden ratio\nis a good principle for design of harmonious book pages we car-\nried out a study with 126 university students from Sweden and\n44 from USA (Pettersson & Strand, 2006). Subjects were asked\nto fold a white paper, size 45x45 cm, to a book page that they\nfelt was the most harmonious. There was no time limit.\nResults showed that there is a large variety in the values of\nwhat a harmonious book page is. On average the most harmo-\nnious book page is 22.7 cm high and 16.6 cm wide. The mean\narea is 382 cm2. Very few subjects created book pages according\nto the principle of the golden ratio. There was no notable differ-\nence between the perceptions of women when it comes to a\nharmonious format on a book page. In this study the mean for-\nmat index was 137 for men and 135 for women. These format\nindexes are close to regular paper, and far away from the golden\n32 ratio. The study showed no significant difference in values of\nsubjects in the two countries. It was concluded that the golden\nratio is not a good principle when it comes to design of book\npages.\nStudy of headings\nAccording to Berndal and Frigyes (1990) the golden ratio has\nbeen used in the past to estimate suitable levels for headlines in\na document. The size of body type is multiplied with 1.62, and\nthen rounded off. If the body type is ten Didot points (=10.7\npica points), and there are four levels for headlines in the\ndocument, the following sizes are adequate: 10, 16, 26 and 42\nDidot points.\nHowever, the use of the golden ratio in art and design seem\nto be based on tradition rather than on facts. In one experiment\nI studied how subjects perceived different headings. In the fall\nof 2002, students at M\u00e4lardalen University in Sweden were\nasked to carefully study and then rank six variants of page lay-\nouts (Pettersson, 2003, p. 45). Subjects were asked to carefully\nstudy the six variations and rank them. There is a relatively\nlarge spread in their perceptions. All the six layout variants\nwere ranked according to the alternative \u201cbest,\u201d or \u201csecond best\u201d\nby at least one person. Taken all together two clear groups em-\nerge, one group that is considered \u201cbetter,\u201d and one group that\nis considered \u201cnot as good.\u201d\nTo the \u201cbetter group\u201d belongs: classic book typography (av-\nerage ranking 2.5), the x-law with normal body type (average\nranking 2.6) and my model for study books (average ranking\n2.8). These three variants are considered clearly better than the\nones that belong to the \u201cnot as good\u201d group.\n33 The \u201cnot as good\u201d group consists of the X-law with bold text\ntype (average ranking 3.8), and the two layout variants that are\nbased on the principle of the golden ratio (average ranking 4.6;\nand 4.7). The principle of the golden ratio apparently gave too\nmuch difference between the type sizes. Also note that the two\nvariants with bold headlines belong to the \u201dnot as good\u201d group.\nHarmony principle\nThe harmony principle is one of the two aesthetic principles in\ninformation design (Pettersson, 2010). Harmony describes the\neffect of the pleasing interaction, and combination of elements\nto form a consistent and orderly whole of all elements in a de-\nsign. Certain design elements look good when they are placed\ntogether and when they interact in a final design. Other design\nelements may look ugly and be distracting. Harmony in design\ncan be said to be a pleasing arrangement and combination of\nelements to form a consistent and orderly whole. We need to\nfind a good vertical as well as a good horizontal balance on a\npage.\nKandinsky wrote (1912/1977 p. 47): \u201cnever has there been a\ntime when it was more difficult than it is today to formulate a\ncomplete theory, ...\u201d Here Kandinsky was referring to a theory\nof harmony and a firm artistic basis. This is still difficult, and\nnot only with reference to art, beauty and harmony-but also\nwith reference to design. The information designer should:\n\u2022 Develop standard templates for graphic design.\n\u2022 Use standard templates for graphic design.\n\u2022 Find balance between the design elements.\nThe term harmony may be used in all design disciplines to\nmean that the design decisions, and the design elements fit to-\n34 gether. Graphic designers and information designers often use\nthe term harmony in discussions on typography and layout.\nThere is harmony in information material when all design ele-\nments fit well together and form harmonious relationships.\nHarmony is often closely related to unity (Wileman, 1993). Bal-\nance and contrast are important aspects of harmony (Mullet &\nSano, 1995).\nThis section includes three sub-sections: 1) dichotomy, 2)\nharmony in typography, and 3) harmony in colour.\nDichotomy\nIn the Greek mythology there is a perpetual struggle between\ntwo sets of opposing forces or ideals, the Apollonian and Dio-\nnysian dichotomy. Apollo and Dionysus were both sons of Zeus.\nApollo was the god of common sense, distance, dreams, healing,\nreason, self-control, and the sun. Dionysus was the god of wine,\ngod of emotion, excess, ecstasy, passion, rage, and wildness.\nThe Apollonian ideal celebrates human creativity through rea-\nson and logical thinking. The Dionysian ideal is based on chaos\nand appeals to the emotions and instincts.\nThe Apollonian and Dionysian philosophical dichotomy is\ncommonly associated with the German philosopher Friedrich\nNietzsche (1844-1900). The visual arts share the same features\nas Apollon, while music is the essence of Dionysus. Paglia\n(1990) used this dichotomy as the basis in her theory of art and\nculture. The Apollonian is light and structured, and associated\nwith males. The Dionysian is dark and chthonic, dwelling within\nor under the earth, and associated with females.\n35 Harmony in typography\nHarmony in typography will be achieved when there is good\nrelationship between the individual elements in the design and\nthe \u201cwholeness\u201d. A balanced typography gives an impression of\nquality and credibility.\nContrast is the difference between the brightest and the\ndimmest parts of a picture or of a text. Regardless of the colour\nand colour-contrast effects contrast should be clear and differ-\nentiate image elements from one another.\nContrast in typography may be achieved by using different\nfonts, styles, sizes and colours. Improper contrast is far too\ncommon. It is quite often a more or less even shade of grey or\nchromatic colours. Different hues may have the same value, and\nas a result almost no contrast. Another common problem is the\nuse of too small symbols and small type. Text must be large en-\nough. The difference in resolution in different media is very im-\nportant. We tend to order impressions that form natural oppos-\nites, thereby reinforcing one another, in groups.\nBalance is the sum of all the elements, the verticals and\nhorizontals, the darks and lights that make up the design. Man\nhas an intuitive sense of balance. Information material should\ndisplay good balance, in a manner, which is interesting but not\ndisturbing or distracting. Balance can be formal or informal.\nFormal balance has total symmetry and it is felt to be static and\nharmonious. It may, however, also be boring.\nComposition can be used to direct the viewers (Wileman,\n1993, p. 93). Informal balance contributes to a feeling of dy-\nnamism (Fleming & Levie, 1978; Pettersson, 1993). It may at-\ntract attention to a specific picture, to a part of a text or to the\nentire information material. However, imbalance and inconsis-\n36 tent use of colours, graphics, or typography, have been found to\nreduce learning (Bradshaw, 1996, 2003).\nHarmony in colour\nHistorical colour theories have included principles used to cre-\nate harmonious colour combinations in architecture and paint-\ning. Perceived relationships between different pure colours have\nbeen visually represented with colours displayed on a circle, a\n\u201ccolour wheel.\u201d Harmonious combinations of pure colours will\nlook good together. Colour combinations that are considered\nespecially pleasing are called colour harmonies or colour\nchords. The artist may use 1) any two colours that are opposite\neach other in a colour wheel, 2) any three colours that are\nequally spaced and forming a triangle on the colour wheel, or 3)\nany four colours forming a square or a rectangle on the colour\nwheel. A colour wheel shows relationships between primary\ncolours, secondary colours, and tertiary colours.\nThe \u201cprimary colours\u201d are red, yellow and blue. The\n\u201csecondary colours\u201d are green, orange and purple, created by\nmixing two primary colours. Mixing of primary and secondary\ncolours gives the six \u201ctertiary colours.\u201d In theory it should be\npossible to mix all colours. However dyers, painters, and print-\ners preferred pure pigments to primary colour mixtures, be-\ncause the mixtures were too dull.\nColour and typographic elements can be used for decora-\ntion. However, it must always be very clear and easy to under-\nstand for the receiver when colour and typography is used for\ndecoration, and when the use is meant to have some cognitive\nimportance.\n37 Aesthetic theories\nAesthetics is usually regarded as a branch of philosophy, along\nwith epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics. It is the\nyoungest branch of philosophy with its own name. Aesthetics\nimplies a hierarchical judgement in which the elements of any\ncompositions, and their organisations, are considered more or\nless appealing to the senses by virtue of their ability to create\nhigher emotional, intellectual, or moral appreciations in people.\nAesthetic theories that are based on perception favour sen-\nsation over intellect, favour seeing over reading, favour univer-\nsality over cultural differences, and favour physical immediacy\nover social mediation (Lupton & Miller, 1999, p. 62).\nThe group art and aesthetic disciplines includes disciplines\nsuch as aesthetics, architecture, art history, computer graphics,\nfilm, fine art, iconography, iconology, illustration, music, paint-\ning, photography, and sculpture. At present the aesthetics\ntheory for ID includes, but is not limited to, the following two\nfields of knowledge: 1) beauty theories, and 2) colour theories.\nBeauty theories\nAestheticians discuss the philosophy of art from various per-\nspectives, such as: definitions of art, experiences of art, inter-\npretations of art, metaphysics of art, and production of art. Phi-\nlosophers have made many unsuccessful attempts to define\nbeauty. Three art theories concerning the nature of beauty are:\n1) the formal theory, 2) the emotional theory, and 3) the rela-\ntional theory.\nAestheticians value art for its originality and expressive-\nness. Its focus is on individual artefacts crafted through the\nmanual and aesthetic virtuosity of the artist. Design, in contrast,\n38 is valued for its fitness to a particular user and to a particular\ntask (Mullet & Sano, 1995, p. 8). While a painter or a sculptor\ncan choose any imaginable shape, a designer is limited by the\nfunction of the thing being designed. Of course many designers\nwant to provide aesthetic experiences where possible, but the\ndesign aesthetic is always related to the intended function of the\ninformation products intended for widespread distribution and\nuse.\nThis field of knowledge includes three areas of knowledge:\n1) philosophy of beauty, 2) philosophy of art, and 3) aesthetics\nand usability.\nPhilosophy of beauty\nThe philosophy of beauty recognises aesthetic phenomena out-\nside of the arts. These aesthetic phenomena can be found in na-\nture, and in non-artistic cultural areas such as mathematics,\nmorality, and science. The philosophy of beauty is concerned\nwith fine arts only insofar as art may be perceived as beautiful.\nPhilosophers have made many unsuccessful attempts to define\nbeauty. However, there is much more to art than beauty. In fact\nin many situations art may have little, or nothing to do with\nbeauty.\nUntil the eighteenth century, scholars regarded the study of\nbeauty as the main problem of aesthetics. Since then aestheti-\ncians have devoted less effort to the philosophy of beauty than\nto the philosophy of art. Today it is also highly relevant to dis-\ncuss aesthetics and usability.\nIconologia\nThe Italian art historian and scholar Cesare Ripa (c. 1560\u2013c.\n1645) published Iconologia, a didactic encyclopaedia in Rome\n39 1593. A second edition was published in Rome in 1603, this\ntime with 684 concepts and 151 woodcuts. The book was ex-\ntremely influential in the 17th and 18th centuries and published\nin another eight Italian editions, and eight editions in other lan-\nguages (Manning, 2002).\nFor more than three hundred years experts in art history all\nover Europe used Iconologia as their prime source of know-\nledge when they discussed description, identification, interpre-\ntation of the content of classical art. Art historians had learned,\nand knew the \u201ctrue\u201d language of art. However this was, and still\nis, not true for people in general. The general public lack these\nnecessary frames of references.\n(Further see the book Information Design 6\u2013Predecessors\n& Pioneers.)\nJudgement of beauty\nOne of the effects of art is the feeling that some things are beau-\ntiful and other things are ugly. In 1790 Immanuel Kant de-\nfended the validity of a \u201csubjective universality\u201d as a \u201cuniversal\nvoice\u201d of the imagination through which beauty became known.\nHe asserted that the \u201cjudgement of beauty\u201d is \u201csubjective,\u201d and\ndefined aesthetic apprehension as \u201ctaste,\u201d an a priori judgement\nseparate from cognition and morality. Aesthetic criticism im-\nplies a judgement that utilises analysis, synthesis, evaluation,\nand feeling in the understanding of beauty.\nBefore Kant, the common assumption was that beauty de-\nsignated some objective feature of things. Most of the earlier\ntheories of beauty declared that beauty was a complex relation\nbetween parts of a whole. Some philosophers called this relation\n\u201charmony\u201d. From the time of the Greeks, a common assumption\nwas that beauty applied not only to art. Beauty manifested itself\n40 in cultural institutions and moral character as well as in natural\nand artificial objects. Philosophers sometimes established very\nfirm rules about what artists should create and what people\nshould like. Many of these rules have been abandoned.\nPsychological pleasure derived from an artwork comes from\nthe similarity of the artist's values and sense of life to one's own\nvalues. Admiration of an artwork comes from the viewer\u2019s ev-\naluation of the artist\u2019s skill, style, and integrity. An individual\ncan dislike the values, the sense of life, or the theme of an art-\nwork, but can admire the artist\u2019s skill or style.\nPhilosophers have made many unsuccessful attempts to de-\nfine beauty. In the 18th century philosophers agreed that beauty\ncould not be defined in terms of the qualities shared by all beau-\ntiful objects. Three theories concerning the nature of beauty are\n1) the formal theory, 2) the emotional theory, and 3) the rela-\ntional theory. The formal theory locates beauty in the qualities\nof objects. According to this theory an object may be considered\nbeautiful when it has integrity, unity, proportion, and splen-\ndour. However, the emotional theory identifies beauty with the\nmental responses of the audience, the listeners and the viewers,\nand their aesthetic experiences. According to the relational\ntheory beauty includes aspects from the other two theories.\nInstructional value\nAesthetically pleasing visuals may not be of great instructional\nvalue. Dwyer and Dwyer (1989, p. 122) found that:\nThe value of different types of visual illustrations is not a\nvalid assessment of instructional effectiveness, that is, aes-\nthetically pleasing visuals may not be of great instructional\nvalue.\n41 It is, however, quite possible that aesthetically pleasing infor-\nmation material will be noticed, and then actually used in a bet-\nter way than material without any obvious aesthetic qualities.\nMalamed (2009, p. 203) noted that when viewers look at\nboth pleasant and unpleasant pictures, they consistently dem-\nonstrate an emotional reaction indicated by pronounced brain\nactivity that does not occur when they look at neutral pictures.\nInformation design may vary a lot in style and quality. Ed-\nward Tufte (1983, 1990, 1997) has provided information design\nwith results from pioneering studies on how information ma-\nterials used for communication can be both beautiful, and at the\nsame time useful. His concepts of chartjunk and data-to-ink\nratio are useful contributions to information design. In news-\npapers attractive information graphics, with \u201cinfotainment\u201d\nvalues, attract more readers (Holmes 1993).\nPhilosophy of art\nAlexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, a leading German philosopher,\nintroduced the term aesthetics in 1735. However, a large num-\nber of philosophers from Plato to the present day have dis-\ncussed \u201cthe philosophy of art.\u201d Seward Barry (1994) defined\naesthetics broadly as an \u201cappreciation of the beautiful,\u201d and\nmore narrowly as a \u201cphilosophy of art, its creative sources,\nforms, and effects.\u201d Aestheticians try to understand the arts in\nbroad and fundamental ways.\nThe philosophy of art includes traditional, philosophical\ntheories of art: for example: Aristotelian, empiricist, existen-\ntialist, feminist, idealist, Marxist, phenomenological, Platonic,\npostmodernist, and rationalist aesthetics theories.\nSuch theoretical positions inform, but are also tested by,\ncritical and interpretive articles about particular types or exam-\n42 ples of artworks. The information designer may focus attention\nupon the visual arts \u2013 as opposed to dance, literature, music,\nand theatre. Philosophers have encountered difficulties in fram-\ning a theory of \u201caesthetic perception\u201d and, more importantly, of\nthe remarkable variety of visual arts. We can discuss the phi-\nlosophy of art from various perspectives, such as: art and de-\nsign, definitions of art, experiences of art, interpretations of art,\nmetaphysics of art, and production of art.\nArt and design\nAestheticians study all the arts, from all countries, and from all\nperiods of history, in relation to their cultural, physical, and\nsocial environments. They try to organise knowledge of art in\nsystematic ways. Aestheticians value art for its originality and\nexpressiveness. Its focus is on individual artefacts crafted\nthrough the manual and aesthetic virtuosity of the artist.\nArt is valued for its originality and its expressiveness. Focus\nis on individual artefacts crafted through the manual and aes-\nthetic virtuosity of the individual artist. Design, in contrast, is\nvalued for its fitness to a particular user and to a particular task\n(Mullet & Sano, 1995, p. 8). While a painter or a sculptor can\nchoose any imaginable shape, a designer is limited by the func-\ntion of the thing being designed. Many designers want to pro-\nvide aesthetic experiences where possible, but the design aes-\nthetic is always related to the intended function of the informa-\ntion products intended for widespread distribution and use.\nDefinitions of art\nA number of philosophers have made unsuccessful attempts to\ndefine art. Usually definitions of art aim at establishing a set of\ncharacteristics applicable to all kinds of fine arts, as well as the\ndifferences that set them apart. After some hundreds of years of\n43 discussions aestheticians have not yet agreed upon a definition\nof art. Some say that it is impossible to define art.\nArt criticism may be defined as the process of judging the\naesthetic qualities of visual art, mainly painting, sculpture, and\narchitecture, but also craft. This has become a specialised field,\nbut judgements about works of art have appeared since ancient\ntimes. In the Western world, reflection on art began with the\nphilosophers of ancient Greece. Plato discussed proportion as\nthe source of beauty, and imitation, as the primary mode of art.\nAristotle identified different kinds of imitation. Xenocrates\nwrote about painting and sculpture, and the ideal synthesis of\nimitation and proportion.\nExperiences of art\nIt is a common belief that a person\u2019s response to art is a mysti-\ncal experience that has no basis in reality and serves no practi-\ncal purpose. But the opposite may very well be true. A positive\nresponse to art is a phenomenon of reality that may reflect a\nperson\u2019s most important values. Another belief is that art is en-\ntirely subjective and cannot be evaluated on an objective basis.\nDiscussions about how people experience art have been\ndominated by theories devised in the 18th century. Some phi-\nlosophers still think of the typical experience of art as contem-\nplative and disinterested, different from everyday concerns. A\nfew modern aestheticians have stressed the continuity between\naesthetic experience and everyday experience. The social sci-\nences, such as anthropology, archaeology, and sociology, help\naesthetics researchers explain the forms that art has taken in\nvarious cultures, and how the arts are related to economic ac-\ntivities, government, religion, and science. Recent theories of\npost structuralism and interpretation theory propose strategies\n44 of critical evaluation that incorporate multiple viewpoints and\naccept a basic indeterminacy in meaning.\nInterpretations of art\nIn aesthetics one area of study is concerned with the study of\nthe interpretations of art, how people criticise, enjoy, and use\nart. What happens in the minds of people when they listen to\nmusic, look at paintings, or read poetry? Knowledge of psychol-\nogy helps the aestheticians to understand how people act, de-\nsire, feel, hear, imagine, learn, see, and think, in relation to art\nand aesthetic experiences.\nOne question is whether strictly deductive reasoning based\non premises descriptive of the artworks can back evaluative\njudgements. According to some opinions judgments are merely\nexpressions of personal preferences. Thus these opinions can-\nnot be considered true or false. Another basic question is\nwhether conflicts over interpretations of a work of art can be\nsettled by facts about the work, or whether more than one in-\nterpretation of a specific work is possible or not.\nFor the media theorist Marshall McLuhan Cubist art re-\nquired \u201cinstant sensory awareness of the whole\u201d (McLuhan,\n1964, p. 13). With Cubism one could not ask about the con-\ntent/message in the artwork, but rather consider the artwork in\nits entirety.\nMetaphysics of art\nAestheticians ask questions like these. What access does art give\npeople to reality? What kind of entity is a work of art? Works of\nart may be physical objects, such as sculptures. However, not all\nworks of art are physical objects. A dance and a theatrical per-\nformance may be as aesthetically relevant as any physical ob-\nject. A flat painting can represent spatial depth and fast move-\n45 ments. What the painting represents may often seem more aes-\nthetically relevant than its physical dimensions.\nSome philosophers have concluded that works of art repre-\nsent mental entities, such as visions and dreams. Other phi-\nlosophers have noticed that artists may express their attitudes,\nemotions, and personality traits in their art, and have concluded\nthat art works belong in a category with non-verbal communica-\ntions rather than with physical objects. Still other philosophers\nargue that works of art exist only in the minds of their creators\nand of their audiences. The question whether art can provide\nknowledge of, or insight into, reality is as old as philosophy it-\nself. Plato argued that art has the power to represent only the\nappearances of reality. The opposite position is common among\nmodern philosophers, artists, and critics.\nSince art can reflect powerfully emotional values to the be-\nholder, art can be appreciated, enjoyed, and loved for those\nvalues. The artwork, however, is an extension of the artist and\nthus can never be spiritually possessed or owned by anyone\nelse, even though the physical ownership of artefacts as well as\ncopyrights can be transferred or sold.\nProduction of art\nWassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) was an influential Russian\nmodernist, and pioneering painter and art theorist. He is con-\nsidered by many to be the father of abstract art and a leader in\nthe movement to free art from the strict bonds of tradition. Ac-\ncording to Kandinsky art is the expression of the spiritual at-\nmosphere of a certain period. Art evolves from the culture that\ninspires artistic expression. The foundation of forms, the har-\nmony of colours, and the principle of art is an \u201cinner necessity,\u201d\nor a \u201cright of the artist\u201d to unlimited freedom. Art is born from\n46 the inner necessity of the artist. Kandinsky taught at the Bau-\nhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis\nclosed it in 1933. He then moved to France. In 1912 Kandinsky\nargued (1912/1977 p. 1): \u201c\nEvery work of art is the child of its age and, in many cases,\nthe mother of our emotions. It follows that each period of\nculture produces an art of its own which can never be re-\npeated.\nIn 1925 Kandinsky published his thoughts of the role of the line,\npoint, and other key elements of non-objective painting. A\npoint, a small bit of paint on the canvas, is neither a geometric\npoint nor a mathematical abstraction. It has colour and a simple\nor complex shape. A point can be isolated, or it can resonate\nwith other points or lines on the canvas. A horizontal line cor-\nresponds with the ground. A vertical line corresponds with\nheight, and offers no support. A diagonal line is un-stable.\nMain questions about the production of art deal with cre-\nativity, imagination, and the role of innate ability in any artistic\nproduction. Ancient and medieval philosophers assumed the\nsame model for producing fine art and crafts. They had no con-\nception that the two are distinct. The present distinction be-\ntween the production of fine art and crafts emerged in Western\nculture after the renaissance. Today most aestheticians assume\nthat something is unique about producing fine art.\nAesthetics and usability\nWe could argue that the very moment that shape exceeds func-\ntionality is the point at which usability is compromised. How-\never, we may also argue that art and aesthetic concerns in gen-\n47 eral serve a basic human need. We may say that artistry makes a\nthing more usable and useful by way of making it special.\nInterface design\nDreilinger (1993, p. 6) wrote about usability and aesthetics as\nthe yin and yang of interface design. Norman (1998) asserted\nthat if everyday design were ruled by aesthetics, life might be\nmore pleasing to the eye but less comfortable; if ruled by\nusability, it might be more comfortable but uglier. The aesthetic\nproperties of a design contribute to its ability to offer a different\nperspective on the world. Paying attention to the aesthetic of\nany design is more important than simply making things look\npretty.\nWhen the Apple Macintosh first appeared on the market\npeople in the business world assumed that aesthetics have no\nuseful function beyond making something look nice. Business\npeople were accustomed to the IBM PC. They assumed that the\naesthetically pleasing Macintosh interface could not possibly be\nas useful as the less attractive text-based interface of the PC.\nAesthetic properties of a design make the product more per-\nsonal, more intimate, and more special.\nAccording to Baggerman (2000, p. 11) all design elements\nin interface design should serve a purpose. It is the same for\ninformation design. In information design functional properties\nare always more important than aesthetic properties. However,\nit may be an advantage if information materials also look good.\nUse of material\nIn many areas of design the use of material is a very important\nfactor. It represents many different aspects of aesthetic as well\nas functional qualities. As an example warning signs must be\nclear and easily noticed in bad and degraded conditions such as\n48 fog, weak illumination, and smoke (Lerner & Collins, 1983).\nSome warning signs need adequate reflectance and good light-\ning equipment (Wogalter, 1999). In the area of wayfinding, or\nwayshowing, the right decision may be to paint lines in different\ncolours on the floor in a hospital, or use reflecting materials in\nsigns. When messages are printed the use of paper, or plastic, is\nof vital importance. The material has to be \u201cright\u201d for the situa-\ntion.\nPerceptual aesthetics\nUnlike the classical tradition perceptual aesthetics seeks mean-\ning through the process of becoming or developing according to\nnature through perceptual dynamics (Seward Barry, 1994). The\nconcept of \u201cperceptual aesthetics\u201d provides us with a unified\napproach to art that reveals a cross-pollination of perceptual\ninsights and aesthetic insights. A perceptually based approach\nto art provides a simple and more basic system of aesthetic\njudgement than do approaches based on morality, contempo-\nrary manners, and taste of style. Perceptual aesthetics is based\non Gestalt psychology and its understanding of the perceptual\nprocess. Perceptual aesthetics seeks to understand how art may\nbe structured. Here simplicity regularity, and symmetry pro-\nvides the foundation from which to judge the effectiveness of\ncomposition in art.\nAesthetic experience in instructional design\nIn 1934 the American educational reformer John Dewey (1859\u2013\n1952) argued that aesthetic is a quality of experience that \u201cpos-\nsesses internal integration and fulfilment\u201d (Dewey, 2005a, p.\n46). Dewey emphasized that aesthetic experience is an everyday\n49 life experience, not something that takes place just on a special\noccasion.\nAccording to Parrish (2005) Dewey\u2019s thoughts from the\n1930s brings insights to instructional design. These insights\nenhance instructional practices (Uhrmacher, 2009). Instruc-\ntional designers frequently point to their affiliations with other\ndesign disciplines and look to them as useful analogues of their\npractice (Parrish, 2005). Aesthetic aspects are of high import-\nance to both designers and end-users in many design disci-\nplines.\nParrish (2009) suggested that \u2018\u2018an instrumental view of\nlearning may consider only the immediately measurable out-\ncomes of a learning experience, particularly its impacts on cog-\nnition, behavior, or performance\u2019\u2019 (p. 513). However, aesthetic,\ncultural, emotional, political, and social qualities of experiences\nhave more than immediate rewards. Parrish (2009) provided\nprinciples that contribute to developing the aesthetics of in-\nstructional design:\n\u2022 Designing clear phases of the learning experience: Chal-\nlenge, engagement, and Conclusion/Resolution.\n\u2022 Learners are made active, not passive recipients of informa-\ntion.\n\u2022 Designing instruction according to concrete activities not to\nobscure constructs.\n\u2022 Designing the setting of learning in a way that all the content\nand activities of the lesson become integrated in coherent\nmanner.\n\u2022 Being a role model of an active learner while being careful\nabout the principles above.\n50 For Parrish, Uhrmacher, and many others aesthetics is far more\nthan beauty. The opposite of aesthetic experience is boredom,\ndisengaged habitual behaviour, or imposed labour.\nColour theories\nColour has probably always been considered as important for\npeople. The Blombos Cave in South Africa has rich deposits\nfrom 100,000\u201370,000 years ago (Henshilwood et al. 2009).\nHere red ochre pieces have been deliberately engraved or in-\ncised with abstract geometric designs, maybe the oldest known\nhuman \u201cartwork.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the 7th century pope Gregorius the Great\n(about 540\u2013604) had said that pictures are used in churches so\nthat those who cannot read at least can look at the walls and\nunderstand what they cannot read in books (Piltz, 2007, p. 128;\nSandquist \u00d6berg, 2007, p.171). Gregorius the Great presented\nhis insights and views in a new and simple manner (Hill, 2008,\np. 169).\nFrom about 1250 Biblia Pauperum consisted of a collection\nof about 50 colourful hand-painted loose pages (Cornell, 1925).\nThe purpose of Biblia Pauperum was to recount the teachings\nof the Bible to the illiterate, who were at that time in the ma-\njority among the inhabitants in most countries.\nThe colour theory and the colour principles that Leon Bat-\ntista Alberti published in Della Pittura (On Painting) have in-\nfluenced the use of colour in the visual arts. Classical painters\nlike Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Peter Paul\nRubens, and Rembrandt, worked with colourful compositions\nwith great sense of colour and light. Leonardo da Vinci set out\nhis beliefs on colour theory in his Treatise on Painting, which\nwas not published until 1651. He wrote that black and white was\n51 indeed colours, and he assigned white, yellow, green, blue, red,\nand black as the simple or primary colours (Anderson Feisner,\n2006, p. 13).\nHistorical colour theories have included principles used to\ncreate harmonious colour combinations in architecture and\npainting. This field of knowledge includes three areas: 1) colour\nwheels, 2) colour systems, and 3) colour for information.\nColour wheels\nPerceived relationships between different pure colours have\nbeen visually represented with colours displayed on a circle, a\n\u201ccolour wheel.\u201d Harmonious combinations of pure colours will\nlook good together. Colour combinations that are considered\nespecially pleasing are called colour harmonies or colour\nchords. The artist may use 1) any two colours that are opposite\neach other in a colour wheel, 2) any three colours that are\nequally spaced and forming a triangle on the colour wheel, or 3)\nany four colours forming a square or a rectangle on the colour\nwheel. A colour wheel shows relationships between primary\ncolours, secondary colours, and tertiary colours.\nEvery historical colour wheel is a visual representation of a\nspecific colour theory (Anderson Feisner, 2006). In 1704, Sir\nIsaac Newton made the first colour wheel. He split white sun-\nlight into red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, and blue.\nIn 1810 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe created a colour\nwheel showing the psychological effect of each colour. The\n\u201cprimary colours\u201d are red, yellow and blue. The \u201csecondary\ncolours\u201d are green, orange and purple, created by mixing two\nprimary colours. Mixing of primary and secondary colours gives\nthe six \u201ctertiary colours.\u201d In theory it should be possible to mix\nall colours. However dyers, painters, and printers preferred\n52 pure pigments to primary colour mixtures, because the mix-\ntures were too dull.\nColour systems\nThere are many theories about how perception of colours actu-\nally works. Colour can be described in aesthetical, physical,\nphysiological, psychological, and technical terms. Hue, value,\nand saturation describe what we see when we look at pictures as\nwell as the real world. Intensity, purity and wavelength are\nphysical dimensions. The relationship between brightness, hue,\nlightness and saturation is very complicated. Colour is reflected\nin and through light. There is nothing yellow in a banana. It\u2019s all\nin how it is perceived. For practical use in art and in industry\nseveral different systems providing numerical indexes for colour\nhave been developed.\nThe Natural Colour System\nIn 1925 Hering based his \u201cnatural system\u201d on man\u2019s natural\nperception of colour that presupposes two pairs of chromatic\ncolours blocking each other, red/green and blue/yellow. Her-\ning\u2019s \u201cnatural system\u201d is the principle for the Natural Colour\nSystem (NCS), developed during the 1970s in the Swedish Col-\nour Center Foundation in Stockholm (H\u00e5rd & Sivik, 1981).\nFrom a perceptual point of view, we perceive six colours as\n\u201cpure.\u201d Black and white are achromatic colours. Yellow, red,\nblue, and green are chromatic colours. These six colours are\ncalled elementary colours. All colours that are not pure ele-\nmentary colours have a varying degree of resemblance to sev-\neral elementary colours. Thus every possible colour can be de-\nscribed with a specific location in a three-dimensional model, a\ntwin cone, called the \u201cNCS Colour Solid.\u201d\n53 The NCS Colour Solid with the six\nelementary colours. Yellow, red,\nblue, and green are all located\non the circumference of the\nColour Circle. The Colour\nTriangle is any vertical sector\nthrough half of the NCS Colour Solid,\nsuch as, e.g., white\u2013blue\u2013black\u2013white.\nThe chromatic elementary colours yellow, red, blue, and green\nare all located on the circumference of the Colour Circle. One\nhundred steps, thus describing the hue of a colour, can divide\neach quadrant.\nThis figure illustrates a cut and opened circumference of the\ncolour circle, here starting with red and ending with red.\nThe Colour Triangle is any vertical sector through half of\nthe NCS Colour Solid. It is used to describe the nuance of a col-\nour, i.e., its degree of resemblance to white, black, and the pure\nchromatic colour of the hue concerned (chromaticness).\n54 There are many thousands of colour triangles. In this example\nthe figure illustrates the colour triangle ending in blue.\nWhen we want to describe a colour using the colour triangle\nand the colour circle, it is done in the following sequence:\nblackness, chromaticness, and hue. For example, a colour of 10\npercent blackness, 80 percent chromaticness, and with a hue of\nY70R will have the notation 1080-Y70R.\nMaximum\nIncreasing\nsensitivity\nsensitivity\nin the eye\nIncreasing Green and yellow\nsensitivity refract in fovea Red is focused\nbehind fovea\nMinimum\nBlue is focused\nsensitivity\nbefore fovea\nin the eye\nThe NCS Colour Circle combined with information on the eye\u2019s\nsensitivity.\n55 Some other colour systems\nThe NCS places emphasis on qualitative variation in the colour\nsensation whereas the Munsell System is based on equally\nspaced visual scales. Both systems are based on surface colours.\nThe Munsell Colour System (MCS) was introduced in 1905 and\nit has been modified several times. The system consists of fixed\narrays of samples that vary in hue, lightness (here called value),\nand saturation (here called chroma). The value scale ranges\nfrom white to black with nine steps of grey. Forty equal steps in\na circle represent hue. The value and the hue are related to each\nother by a maximum of sixteen \u201csaturation steps.\u201d\nThere are many theories about how perception of colours\nactually works. In 1807, Young proposed a tri-chromatic colour\nvision system. In 1924, Young\u2019s theory was formalized by von\nHelmholz, who proposed hypothetical excitation curves for\nthree kinds of cones in the retina, sensitive for red, green, and\nblue.\nIn the Hue Lightness Saturation System (HLS), the hues\nare arranged as circles on the outside of a double cone resem-\nbling the NCS Colour Solid (Murch, 1983). Hue specifications\nstart with blue at 0\u00b0 and then follow the spectral order around\nthe circle. Lightness and saturation are defined as percentages\nfrom 0 to 100. The HLS system is easy to use for colours on the\nsurface of the model. However, colours inside the model are\ndifficult to define. As in the Munsell- and NCS-systems, bright-\nness creates problems.\nThe Hue Value Saturation System (HVS) is a model that is\nrather similar to the NCS-system but it utilizes another coding\n(Samit, 1983). Here value is defined as the relative lightness.\nWhite has full value and black has no value at all.\n56 There are many other colour systems, colour wheels, and\ncolour circles. Today printers who use modern subtractive col-\nour methods use magenta, yellow, cyan, and black as primaries.\nColour scientists often use the additive primaries, red, green\nand blue (RGB). These colours are used for anything light-based\nvisual displays, like computer monitors, and television screens.\nPeople who are specially trained can use the RGB proportions\nas a colour description system. However, this is not possible for\npeople in general.\nIn web design colours are defiend with a six-digit\nhexadecimal number or triplet, a hex value/hex triplet. Colours\ncan be specified in the format #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, and\nBB are the hexadecimal values for red, green and blue values of\nthe colour. The values varies from zero to maximum 255 for\neach component.\nColour for information\nColour is regularly used in printed materials, not only in il-\nlustrations, but also in the text itself. Colour can be used to\nclarify the structure of the text and to make learning easier. Cer-\ntain parts of the text may be printed with colours or printed on\ntop of backgrounds in different colours. Black type has good\ncontrast to many light background colours. The legibility will\nalways be affected when there is insufficient contrast between\nthe type and the background.\nFrom many experiments, it is clear that people prefer col-\nour in visuals. To some extent colour is a language of its own.\nColour enhances the attention and perception of a visual mes-\nsage. If people like the contents in a picture, they like them even\nmore when the visual is presented in colour. Advertising is\n57 known to be much more effective when visuals are in colour\nthan in black and white.\nWe can use colour to clarify the structure of a text, group\nelements, indicate meaning, and to make learning easier. Col-\nour can be used as an important and a successful part of infor-\nmation design (Bradshaw, 2001; Dwyer, 1971, 1978; Hannafin &\nPeck, 1988; Lipton, 2007; Moriarty, 1991; Muter & Marrutto,\n1991; Pettersson, 1989; Scharff, Hill & Ahumada, 2000; Winn,\n1993; Wogalter, 1999).\nInconsistent and improper use of colour can be distracting,\nfatiguing, and upsetting, and it can actually produce negative\nresults and reduce learning. It should also be remembered that\nsome people are red-green colour blind and they perceive these\nhues as grey.\n(See the book Information Design 3\u2013Image Design regard-\ning Use of colour, and the book Information Design 5\u2013\nCognition regarding Colour blindness.)\nContributions for ID\nThe aesthetics theory for ID contributes to information design\nwith valuable facts, practices, principles, and theoretical ap-\nproaches. Some examples of important concepts are: aesthetic\ndesign, additive colour, aesthetic proportions, aesthetically\npleasing, architecture, balance, beauty, colour chords, colour\ncircles, colour harmonies, colour systems, colour theories, col-\nour wheels, composition, decoration, divine proportion, fine art,\ngolden ratio, golden rectangle, golden section, harmony princi-\nple, illustration, material, philosophy of art, philosophy of\nbeauty, photography, primary colours, proportion, quality,\nsecondary colours, subtractive colour, and tertiary colours.\n58 Here are some facts, hypotheses, and postulates based on\nthe aesthetics theory for ID.\n\u2022 Aesthetic designs are perceived as easier to use than less-\naesthetic designs.\n\u2022 Aesthetic value is the aggregate effect of all picture variables.\n\u2022 Colour can be described in aesthetical, physical, physiologi-\ncal, psychological, and technical terms.\n\u2022 Colour enhances the attention and perception of a visual\nmessage.\n\u2022 Colour wheels are visual representations of colour theories.\n\u2022 Every historical colour wheel is a visual representation of a\nspecific colour theory.\n\u2022 For the receiver it must always be absolutely clear if colour is\nused for decoration, or if it has some cognitive importance.\n\u2022 Graphic form, text, and visuals should always work together\nto fulfil information design objectives.\n\u2022 Imbalance and inconsistent use of colours, graphics, or ty-\npography, have been found to reduce learning.\n\u2022 Informal balance contributes to a feeling of dynamism.\n\u2022 People in different cultures may have varying opinions of\nharmony.\n\u2022 Proportions according to the \u201cgolden section\u201d are not always\nappropriate in information design.\n59 Functional principles\nThe group \u201cFunctional principles\u201d includes six message design\nprinciples: Defining the problem, Providing structure, Provid-\ning clarity, Providing simplicity, Providing emphasis, and\nProviding unity. Guidelines that are based on these six princi-\nples will assist the information designer to design information\nmaterials that are well suited for the intended receivers.\n(See the book Information Design 1\u2013Message Design for\ninformation regarding Defining the problem, Information De-\nsign 2\u2013Text Design for information regarding Providing struc-\nture, and Information Design 3\u2013Image Design for more infor-\nmation regarding Legibility of pictures.)\nProviding clarity\nThe legibility of a graphical message is determined by the\ntechnical design of texts and pictures, that is, their clarity. The\ninformation designer will have to make the content stand out\nclearly from the background. In general information materials\nshould be as clear, simple, unambiguous and transparent as\npossible. We should avoid unusual typefaces, as well as fonts\nthat are too small or too large. We read words in a text as \u201cpic-\ntures,\u201d not letter by letter. Typeface and font size must be ad-\napted to meet the limitations of the medium and technical pro-\nduction. A message has good legibility if it is easy to read, and if\nthe reader can easily see and distinguish all different parts of\nthe message.\nGood legibility is always economically advantageous,\nwhereas poor legibility is a costly business. Good models make\nthe production of documents simple and inexpensive. In my\nview it is not economical to cram too much information on a\n60 page. It is better to edit the text and reduce its bulk, and thereby\nincrease its legibility.\nLegibility can be measured rather objectively and its quality\nis assessable whether we understand the content of the message\nor not. Dissatisfaction with the execution of a message may also\ncause dissatisfaction with the content of the message (Petters-\nson, 1989). Therefore the information designer has to consider\nthe legibility of text printed on paper, displayed and projected\non screens, as well as legibility of pictures, legibility of layout,\nlegibility of symbols, legibility of numerals, and legibility of\ncolours.\nLegibility of text\nDepending on the purpose, we can read a text in several ways.\nAn active reader makes good use of the structure embedded in\nthe text. The preface, the table of contents, the headings, as well\nas the captions and the illustrations provide an overview of the\ncontent in the whole book.\nThe concept \u201clegibility of text\u201d refers to a text\u2019s external\nproperties (Lipton, 2007; Pettersson, 1993; Williams & Tollet,\n1998). These are properties such as letter size, inter-line dis-\ntance, line length, the distance between letters, the number of\nletters per line, the distance between words, headings, the sub-\ndivision into paragraphs, headings in the margin, the layout,\ncolour of the printing ink and paper, the paper quality, etc.\nThese different external properties have not been found to have\na drastic effect on legibility as long as the text is presented\nwithin the framework of variation normally found in contempo-\nrary books.\nFurthermore legibility refers to production and material\nquality, environmental conditions, room lighting and tempera-\n61 ture, noise level, et cetera. Principles for legibility are presented\nin the following sub-sections: Legibility of print media, Legi-\nbility of text on wall charts, Legibility of text on computer\nscreens, and Legibility of projected texts.\nLegibility of print media\nA printed text in books, handouts, reports and other printed\ndocuments must have good legibility. Therefore the information\ndesigner will have to:\n\u2022 Use clear, direct, simple and transparent typography.\n\u2022 Use a common typeface, between nine and twelve Pica\npoints, for continuous text in a book, a pamphlet, or a re-\nport.\n\u2022 Restrict the number typefaces and only use a few per infor-\nmation material.\nSee the two chapters Typography and Layout for more infor-\nmation.\nLegibility of projected texts\nIn verbal presentations, many of the overhead transparencies,\nslides, filmstrips, and projected computer presentations consist\nmainly, or sometimes only of text. Here lettering must be con-\nsidered carefully in order to guarantee good legibility for all lis-\nteners. In preparing the material the information designer\nshould:\n\u2022 Use no more than six rows of six words in each image, set in\na linear typeface, with characters large and bold enough.\n\u2022 Maintain a good contrast between foreground and back-\nground.\n\u2022 Avoid graduated and tonal background fills.\n62 Before the presentation the presenter will need to reduce room\nillumination and clean slides, lenses, and screens. During the\npresentation it is important to really project the images in focus\nand on the screen, preferably horizontally. (See the chapter The\nelements of graphic design for more information.)\nLegibility of text on wall charts\nA wall chart must have good legibility. The information designer\nshould:\n\u2022 Set text bold and large enough, adjusted to the reading dis-\ntance.\n\u2022 Use lower case letters and avoid all-capital printing for run-\nning text.\n\u2022 Restrict the number typefaces.\nPosters and wall charts shall be read from some distance.\nTherefore text should be large enough (Ormrod, 1989; Petters-\nson, 1993; Wileman, 1993), and bold enough (Mayer, 1993; Pet-\ntersson, 1993; Wileman, 1993, p. 79). Too small or too large let-\ntering will impair reading. The text on a poster or a wall chart\nmay often have to be ten times larger in size than a text in a\nbook or on a print out. Text should be set in lower case letters,\nbecause all-capital printing has been shown to markedly reduce\nthe speed of reading (Henney, 1981; Poulton and Brown, 1968).\nSince the texts on posters and wall charts should be short it may\nbe a good idea to use a sans serif typeface like Arial or Helvetica.\nIf so the running text will need some extra space between the\nlines (Collier & Cotton, 1989).\nLegibility of text on screens\nCompared with traditional graphic presentations, a presenta-\ntion of information on visual displays such as television sets and\n63 computer terminals is very limited. Still, information may be\npresented in many different ways. The design may vary with\nrespect to spatial organization like directive cues, colours, col-\numns, headings, justification, lines, scrolling text, spacing, and\ntwinkling characters or words. A text on a computer screen\nmust have good legibility. The information designer should:\n\u2022 Use typefaces designed for screen display.\n\u2022 Use black text on a white or yellow background.\n\u2022 Avoid the use of all capital letters.\n(See the two chapters The elements of graphic design, and Lay-\nout for more information.)\nLegibility of pictures\nA message has good legibility if it is easy to read, and if the\nreader can easily see and distinguish all different parts of the\nmessage. Legibility can be measured rather objectively and its\nquality is assessable whether we understand the content of the\nmessage or not. Dissatisfaction with the execution of a message\nmay also cause dissatisfaction with the content of the message.\nTherefore the information designer has to consider the legibility\nof text printed on paper, displayed and projected on screens, as\nwell as legibility of pictures, legibility of layout, legibility of\nsymbols, legibility of numerals, and legibility of colours. The\ninformation designer should:\n\u2022 Use picture elements that are bold and large enough.\n\u2022 Use a style guide for picture elements in schematic pictures.\n\u2022 Set words in images and pictures bold and large enough to\nread.\n64 (See the book Information Design 3\u2013Image Design for more\ninformation in these areas.)\nLegibility of layout\nAn \u201cinformative layout\u201d must have good legibility. Therefore the\ninformation designer should:\n\u2022 Use standard page sizes with standard grids for pre-\nplanning of pages.\n\u2022 Use a clear and simple layout.\n\u2022 Use arrows, bullets, lines, and symbols in various colours;\nalso margin notes, repetition, and space to highlight relevant\ninformation.\n(See the chapter Layout for general information.)\nLegibility of symbols\nThe use of symbols has a long tradition and various symbols can\nbe used to aid communication. The information designer\nshould:\n\u2022 Use distinct colours and simple graphical elements to design\nsymbols that will function in any size.\n\u2022 Design solid figures with a distinct contrast to the back-\nground.\n\u2022 Use characters and graphical elements that are bold, distinct\nand large enough.\n(See the book Information Design 3\u2013Image Design for more\ninformation.)\n65 Legibility of numerical values\nNumerical data and information can be presented in tables and\nin graphs. A table in an information material must have good\nlegibility. Therefore the information designer should:\nTables\n\u2022 Use type between 8 and 12-point size for table cells.\n\u2022 Use vertically oriented tables.\n\u2022 Use rounded off numbers.\nGraphs\n\u2022 Compare lengths of variables to show their relationships.\n\u2022 Compare areas of variables to show their parts of a whole.\n\u2022 Use actual figures in graphs when accuracy is needed.\n(See the chapters The elements of graphic design and Layout\nfor more information.)\nLegibility of maps\nMaps must have good legibility. Therefore the information de-\nsigner should:\n\u2022 Use bold and distinct symbols in a consistent size.\n\u2022 Restrict the number of typefaces and complexity of patterns.\n\u2022 Provide distinct contrast in form and dimensions.\n(See the book Information Design 3\u2013Image Design for more\ninformation.)\nLegibility of colour\nColour can be used to clarify the structure of a text. Certain\nparts of the text may be printed with colours or printed on top\nof backgrounds in different colours. Colours used in informa-\n66 tion materials must have good legibility. Therefore the informa-\ntion designer should:\n\u2022 Use a light or a dark background colour appropriate to the\ncontent, and then use a colour with good contrast for the\nfigure or text.\n\u2022 Make sure that differences between colours are clear and\nobvious.\n\u2022 Combine colours with shape in warning signs.\nColour is regularly used in printed materials, not only in il-\nlustrations, but also in the text itself. The most legible combina-\ntions of print colours are black or dark brown text on a light yel-\nlow background (Pettersson, 1989; Pettersson et al., 1984a).\nBlack type on a white background gives the highest and most\ncomfortable contrast for sustained reading (Bradshaw, 2001;\nLipton, 2007; Muter & Marrutto, 1991; Scharff, Hill, & Ahu-\nmada 2000). Other combinations may attract more attention\nbut are less legible and, thus, require larger type. The legibility\nwill always be affected when there is insufficient contrast be-\ntween the type and the background. There are strong cultural\ndifferences in interpreting the meanings of colour.\nGood legibility\nHere black type on a yellow\nbackground gives good legibility. Poor legibility\nThe orange text on the same\nbackground gives poor legibility.\nThe background colour of a computer screen should be\n\u201cfairly light\u201d or \u201cfairly dark,\u201d depending on the content. The text\n67 displayed on a screen should have an opposite (\u201cfairly dark\u201d or\n\u201cfairly light\u201d) colour (Bradshaw, 2001). The most legible colour\ncombination is black text on a white or yellow background (Pet-\ntersson et al., 1984a).\nUnfortunately, red and green are often used as discriminat-\ning colours in symbols and in warning signs. Since many colour-\nblind people perceive red and green as grey, colour can only be\nused to code the information redundantly. Colour may be com-\nbined with shape, and position, or with both, which is often\nseen in traffic signs.\nProviding emphasis\nThe most important elements in information material may be\nemphasized to enhance attention and perception. A dark dot in\na light field and a jog in a straight line are two good examples of\nemphasis. Emphasis may be used to attract, direct and to keep\nattention. Typography and layout will better show the structure\nand the hierarchy of the content in the information material\nwhen important parts are emphasised. The information de-\nsigner should:\n\u2022 Use specific elements for emphasis.\n\u2022 Use clear contrasts for emphasis.\n\u2022 Use variables like complexity, directionality, exaggerated\nfeatures, humour, isolation or motion for emphasis.\nIt is possible to provide emphasis in information material with\nthe help of a number of specific design elements. Generally\nspeaking highlighting cues and emphasis in a message will re-\nsult in attention to that message. We should, however, never\noveruse any accenting techniques because if we do they may\ncompletely lose their meanings and their power to emphasize\n68 (Dwyer, 1978; Hartley, Bartlett, and Branthwaite 1980; Benson,\n1985; Bausell and Jenkins 1987).\nSee the section Emphasis in book 3 Image Design for em-\nphasis in pictures and symbols.\nEmphasis in text\nThere are a several possibilities to emphasize elements in ty-\npography. We can use boldface, colour, italics, key words in red,\nlight against dark, small against large, and underlining key\nwords. In order not to confuse the readers, it is important to\nestablish a consistent system for how to signal emphasis.\nWhen used purposefully, contrast can reveal the structure\nof the content helping readers see relationships among the parts\n(Ivory, Sinha and Hearst, 2001). Typographic cuing generally\nrefers to the use of bold or italic type or underlining to signal\nthe important ideas in a text. There is little doubt that cuing\ndoes work well in drawing attention to the cued material\n(Glynn, Britton and Tillman, 1985). The consensus is that read-\ners are more likely to remember cued ideas than un-cued ideas\n(Hartley, 1987). In an experiment with 300 subjects Cisotto and\nBoscolo (1995) found that the use of paragraph headings im-\nproved learning. However, underlining of relevant information\ndid not have the same effect. Underlining did not improve\nlearning.\nHeadings should always be relevant and identify the subject\nmatter. The purposes of headings are to attract the attention of\nthe readers, make the subject matter readily apparent, and indi-\ncate the relative importance of different items in the document.\nTo avoid too large masses of text, it is a good idea to divide the\ntext into sections, subsections, and paragraphs. Headings on\ndifferent hierarchic levels will provide the readers with refer-\n69 ence point and help them to organize information cognitively\nfor better retention and recall. Headings set in different type\nversions aid comprehension of the text content (Jonassen,\n1982).\nNormally boldface and italics will not be used for continu-\nous text. Italic print is read more slowly than regular type and is\nalso disliked by many readers (Tinker, 1965). However, the in-\nformation designer can decide to use boldface and italics for\nemphasis of parts of a text (Lipton, 2007; Mayer, 1993; Tinker,\n1965).\nThe use of underlining and all capital letters should be re-\nstricted to headings and titles, if they are used at all. Usually\nbold and italics are quite sufficient. Underlining in the middle of\na sentence makes the lower line more difficult to read (Isaacs,\n1987). Shadow and outline letters should be avoided.\nThere are a few other possibilities to emphasize paragraphs\nin texts, such as adjunct question to relevant information\n(Mayer, 1993) and statements of objectives for emphasis (Briggs\n& Wager, 1989; Mayer, 1993).\nEmphasis in layout\nMost people read instructional materials selectively. Readers\nrarely, if ever, begin at the beginning and read straight through\nto the end of a document. Usually we use a combination of\nbrowsing, reading headings, looking at illustrations, reading\ncaptions, reading certain parts carefully, skimming others, and\navoiding some parts completely. Many readers will only spend\ntime on a limited amount of information in a newspaper. It is\nknown that elements like headings, photos, drawings, and in-\nformation graphics attract attention and often are entry point\ninto a page. Size and placement of such elements influence how\n70 the reader will actually read the page. Many readers may jump\nover too large pictures and never look at them at all.\nThe competition for our attention is usually very fierce in\ncommercial arts and in advertising. Thus discontinuity is often\nused intentionally to attract and even to hold attention of the\nviewers. The intended message may be hidden within verbal or\nvisual puns, within metaphors, satires, parodies, or within hu-\nmour. In these cases, designers break the traditional rules or\nguidelines of instructional message design. It might also be pos-\nsible to deliberately use the unexpected to attract attention to\ninstructional materials.\nThere are a several possibilities to emphasize elements in\ntypography and layout. The information designer can use a\nnumber of \u201ctools,\u201d such as:\n\u2022 Areas of colour (Mijksenaar, 1997).\n\u2022 Areas of shading (Mijksenaar, 1997; Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Arrows (Beck 1984; Hartley, 1987; Jonassen & Kirschner,\n1982; Lamberski & Dwyer, 1983; Mayer, 1993; Pettersson,\n1989; Winn, 1989;).\n\u2022 Black type on a white background (Muter & Marrutto, 1991;\nScharff, Hill & Ahumada, 2000).\n\u2022 Bold against standard (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Boldface (Hartley, 1987; Jonassen & Kirschner, 1982;\nMayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Boxes (Mijksenaar, 1997).\n\u2022 Bullets (Mayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Circles or ovals around objects (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Clear contrasts (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Colour (Winn, 1993; Wogalter, 1999).\n\u2022 Colour against no colour (Pettersson, 1989).\n71 \u2022 Colour coding (Bradshaw, 2003; Hannafin & Peck, 1988)\n\u2022 Complexity (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Contrast (Muter & Marrutto, 1991; Pettersson, 1989; Scharff,\nHill & Ahumada 2000).\n\u2022 Detail against no detail (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Directionality (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Headings (Hartley, 1987; Jonassen & Kirschner, 1982;\nMayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Highlight relevant information (Mayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Icons (Mayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Illustrations (Mijksenaar, 1997).\n\u2022 Imbalance (Fleming & Levie, 1978).\n\u2022 Irregular design (Fleming & Levie, 1978, 1993)\n\u2022 Italics (Mayer, 1993; Mijksenaar, 1997; Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Key words in red (Fleming & Levie, 1978).\n\u2022 Larger font (Mayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Light against dark (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Lines (Mijksenaar, 1997).\n\u2022 Logos (Mijksenaar, 1997).\n\u2022 Margin notes (Mayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Repetition (Mayer, 1993).\n\u2022 Shaded areas against plain backgrounds (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Small against large (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Symbols (Mijksenaar, 1997).\n\u2022 Tonal areas against plain backgrounds (Pettersson, 1989).\n\u2022 Underlining key words (Fleming & Levie, 1978; Mayer,\n1993).\n\u2022 Unexpected design (Fleming & Levie, 1978, 1993)\n\u2022 Unstable design (Fleming & Levie, 1978, 1993).\n\u2022 Variation out of context (Pettersson, 1989).\n72 \u2022 White space (Hartley, 1987; Jonassen & Kirschner, 1982;\nMayer, 1993).\nItalics give emphasis to a word or a group of words. In order not\nto confuse the readers, it is important to establish a consistent\nsystem for how to signal emphasis. Use italics for emphasis\nsparingly; too many italicised words may reduce the emphasis\neffect.\nProviding unity\nAesthetic theories that are based on perception favour sensation\nover intellect, favour seeing over reading, favour universality\nover cultural differences, and favour physical immediacy over\nsocial mediation (Lupton & Miller, 1999, p. 62). Aesthetics\ntreats the conditions of sensuous perception and aims to estab-\nlish general principles of art and beauty, and of proportion and\nharmony.\nUnity suggests an \u201coverall togetherness\u201d in the information\nmaterial. It is more or less the opposite to emphasis. According\nto some authors unity is the fabric about which the entire in-\nformation structure with its text elements and pictures is inter-\nwoven. In a design that lacks unity the different elements com-\npete for attention. It is chaos and it creates confusion for the\nreceivers. However, the systems for desktop publishing make it\npossible for the individual author to integrate words and visuals\nto aid communication.\nAll kinds of inconsistencies in an information material may\nconfuse the receivers. It may become unnecessarily complicated\nfor them to interpret and understand the intended content of\nthe message. There is a close relationship between guidelines\naimed at providing unity and guidelines aimed at providing\n73 harmony. To provide unity in information material the informa-\ntion designer can:\n\u2022 Use style and terminology in a consistent way in each spe-\ncific information material.\n\u2022 Use layout and typography in a consistent way.\n\u2022 Use highlighting techniques in a consistent way.\nTo get maximum impact from a picture it should be introduced\nin the text between the appropriate paragraphs. Each picture\nshould also have its own caption. Substantial research has\nclearly shown that learning efficiency is much enhanced when\nwords and visuals interact and supply redundant information\n(Levie & Lentz, 1982; Levin & Lesgold, 1978). The improvement\nsometimes exceeds sixty percent and averages thirty percent.\nMany authors have found that pictures should be put as\nclose to the relevant running text as possible (Benson, 1985;\nBraden, 1983; Clark & Lyons, 2004; Haber & Hershenson,\n1980; Hartley & Burnhill, 1977a; Lidman & Lund, 1972; Mac-\nDonald-Ross, 1977; Mayer, 1993; Mayer & Sims, 1994; Mayer et\nal., 1995; Moreno & Mayer, 2000; Pettersson, 1989, 1993;\nSchriver, 1997; Wright, 1982). Illustrations in textbooks are of-\nten \u201cforgotten\u201d by students as well as teachers; therefore it is\nimportant for editors and information designers to clearly in-\nstruct the learners to make good use of the pictures (Hannus,\n1996; Peeck, 1993, 1994; Reinking, 1986).\nVisuals designed to complement oral and printed instruc-\ntion should both have a high correlation with the message they\nare attempting to support, and need to be designed to provide\nthe learning environment with specific types of stimuli needed\nby particular types of learners, to achieve special educational\nobjectives.\n74 Wileman (1993, p. 93) provided the following checklist with\nquestions for evaluation of visuals with reference to unity:\n1. Are the visual elements (words, pictures, graphic design\nelements) well laid out?\n2. Does the margin unify or add to the composition of the\nvisual?\n3. Does the entire message (words and images) fill the screen?\n4. If words are used, is it clear which words go with what pic-\ntures?\n5. Does the composition direct the viewers to the centre of at-\ntention?\n6. Does the composition support what is being taught?\nWe may distinguish between three types of unity. Pragmatic\nunity is that the characteristics of the viewer can work for or\nagainst recognition of an image. Semantic unity is the possi-\nbility to identify an image. Syntactic unity is an acknowledge-\nment that an image exists. A minimum requirement is that the\nbounds of each image should be discernible.\n75 Typography\nTypography is the art and technique of arranging type in order\nto make the message visible and it provides a large number of\npossibilities to make the structure in a document clear (Benson,\n1985; Tinker, 1963, 1965). The graphic designer will select type-\nfaces, point sizes, line length, and line spacing and alter the\npresentation of headings, running text, captions, lists, tables,\nand ornaments.\nTypography determines the clarity of the message and has\nbeen noted to have the capacity to influence brand perception\n(Childers & Jass, 2002, p. 104) and consumer motivation\n(McCarthy & Mothersbaugh, 2002, p. 664). Graphic designers\nuse typography in different ways. Over time, we have become\naccustomed to associating certain styles of typographic design\nwith certain kinds of content and tone of voice (Moys, 2011).\nAny typographic feature that reduces ability to readily rec-\nognize and discriminate individual letters within words and\nwords within larger text units will decrease legibility (McCarthy\n& Mothersbaugh, 2002, p. 670). \u201cNovelty\u201d or \u201cincongruity\u201d may\nhave the inverse effect of generating interest in advertising\n(McCarthy & Mothersbaugh, 2002), and this is certainly also\ntrue in information design.\nType\nThe words we need in books and other graphical media use\ntype. The term type refers to all characters that are used in\nprinting. It may be hard to imagine how people lived 500 years\nago without type. At that time all texts were copied by hand or\nthey were printed from wood blocks. Today printers use thou-\nsands of type styles. A type style makes somewhat the same im-\n76 pression on the reader that a speaker\u2019s voice makes on the lis-\ntener. Some type may suggest strength. Others may suggest\ndelicacy.\nDesign of characters\nIndividual characters can be designed in many different ways\n(Strizver, 2006). Many characters are based on geometrical\nshapes like the circle, oval, rectangle, square, and triangle.\nCircles and triangles need to have a slightly larger height (3\u2013\n4%) than a corresponding square.\nCrossbar Head serif Cross line Spur\nCounter Ascender Lobe or ear\nCounter\nH air line Stem Eye Bowl\nSwell\nCharacter width Counter\nDescender Link\nMain stroke Serif Loop\nThe terminology in typography is based on hot metal type\ncomposition. Here are some examples.\nThe differences between many typefaces are subtle. It is not\nalways possible to see the differences without special training.\nTypefaces can be identified by looking for classic traits, such as\nthe shape of specific parts of lower-case letters. A complete as-\nsortment of characters of the same style and size is called a font\nor a font of type. Thus, each typeface appears in many different\nfonts. However, in computer manuals the word font is some-\ntimes used to mean typeface, which is of course confusing.\n77 Imaginary lines are used in the positioning of letters. The\nbaseline is the main point of reference in typography. The x-\nheight is the vertical space occupied by lowercase letters (ex-\ncluding ascenders and descenders). The H-height or cap height\nis the height of capital H. The point size or type size is the verti-\ncal space allowed for any character of a typeface.\nU pper type size line\nC ap line\nH kpx\nx-line\nx-height H-height Type size\nB aseline\nD escender line\nLl inoew er type size line\nImaginary lines are used in the positioning of letters. Helvetica\n72 point is used in this illustration.\nWhen designing characters for digital environments, it is\nimportant to consider how to compensate for the limitations in\nfonts that are designed for traditional printing. All fine lines in\ncharacters present huge challenges for adaptation to screens,\nsince they only represent a small percent of a pixel (Josephson,\n2008; Bias et al., 2010). Digital-text developers improve text for\nlow-resolution computer displays by font design, font hinting,\nand rendering technologies (Bias et al., 2010, p. 746). Font hint-\ning refers to editing typeface outlines to available pixels. Ren-\ndering technologies aim to give screen text the clarity of printed\ntext.\nThe lowercase letters of a and g are designed both in \u201cone\nstorey, or single storey, letter forms\u201d and in \u201ctwo storey letter\n78 forms.\u201d Walker and Reynolds (2003) discussed whether 6-year-\nold children find serif text with \u201cinfant character forms\u201d (e.g.\nvariants of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019) easier or more difficult to read than \u201cadult\ncharacter forms.\u201d The results showed that children in the test\ngroup could read specially-designed texts set in Gill and Cen-\ntury, with and without infant characters, equally well.\nOne storey \u201cinfant character forms\u201d (left) and \u201ctwo storey\nadult character forms\u201d (right).\nTypefaces\nThe term typeface refers to the general outline, the face, per-\nsonality, and shape of the individual characters. During the\nlittle more than 500 years of western printing history, probably\nmore than 60,000 typefaces have been designed (Mijksenaar,\n1997). It is easy to combine them in many ways. Most of these\ntypefaces are, however, limited in their usefulness. Differences\nare often subtle. It is not always possible to see the differences\nwithout special training. The distinctive details and the explicit\nforms of words may facilitate word recognition.\nLupton (2010, p 13) argued that: \u201cTypefaces are an essen-\ntial resource employed by graphic designers, just as glass, stone,\nsteel, and countless other materials are employed by architects.\u201d\nExperts employ several systems for classification. Classifi-\ncation systems may be based on chronology, on evolution, and\non various elements of letter shapes. Most systems are incom-\nplete and more or less confusing. The system that has enjoyed\nthe largest general favour divides typefaces into four main\n79 classes: 1) Roman type style. 2) Sans serif type style. 3) Script\ntype style. 4) Black letter type style. Within these classes groups\nof type designs with important similarities form \u201ctype families.\u201d\nRoman type style with serifs (left)\nA A\nand sans serif type style (right).\nIn this example we can compare\nGaramond and Geneva of the same size.\nThere are four main types of serifs:\nbracketed serif, hairline serif,\nwedge serif, and slab serif.\nRoman type style\nThe Roman type style includes most of the typefaces used in\nmodern printing. These typefaces have serifs, finishing strokes\nnormally at the top and at the bottom of the main strokes of\nletters. Serifs are not just put there for decoration. They help us\ndistinguish between characters. Serif typefaces are often con-\nsidered to make it easier to follow text lines and thus be easier\nto read than sans serif typefaces (Tinker, 1963), except for small\nletter sizes (Benson, 1985; Braden, 1985; Mackiewicz 2004).\nVisual psychophysical studies in adult readers have shown that\nserifs have little effect on legibility (Arditi & Cho, 2005).\nMost typefaces in books for children are sans serif. Walker\nand Reynolds (2003) studied whether reading books for young\nchildren should be set in serif or sanserif type. Their results\nsuggested that there is little significant difference in children's\nreading performance when Century is compared with Gill.\n80 introduction\nSerifs on characters make it easier to follow the horizontal\nlines with text. However this part of a word is very hard to\nread.\nintroduction\nThe upper parts of letters shape the images of words. Thus this\npart of the word is rather easy to read.\nintroduction\nSerifs are terminal strokes, normally at the top and the bottom\nof the main strokes of letters in a Roman type style. This type-\nface is called Garamond.\nTypefaces are often named after the designers who created\nthem or after the printers who first used them. Common exam-\nples of serif typefaces are Baskerville, Berling, Bodoni, Book-\nman, Caslon, Century Old Style, Garamond, New Century\nSchoolbook, Palatino, and Times New Roman.\nThe French printer Nicolas Jenson worked in Italy. He per-\nfected the first Roman style type already in 1470. In France\nClaude Garamond created the Garamond-style about 1540. In\nEngland William Caslon designed the Caslon-style in 1734; and\nJohn Baskerville created the Baskerville-style about 1757. In\nItaly Giambatista Bodoni designed a new kind of Roman type\n81 style in 1768. For more than 200 hundred years the Bodoni-\nstyle has been called modern or modern type. Classical news-\npaper typefaces are Century Old Style, Ionic, Excelsior, Times\nNew Roman, and Corona. They were all created for the hot-\nmetal print and the rotary letterpress printing.\nSans serif type style\nThe Sans serif type style has no serifs on the characters. These\ntypefaces provide uniform weight when there are less-than-\noptimal reading conditions and they are often used for head-\nings, labels in pictures, diagrams, captions and tables (Benson,\n1985; Lipton, 2007; Mackiewicz, 2004; Pettersson, 1993). Wil-\nliams and Tollet (1998) suggests we should use sans serif type to\nimprove legibility. Sans serif type can be used successfully for\nthe body text in books, pamphlets and reports.\nCommon examples of sans serif type are Avant Garde, Fu-\ntura, Geneva, Gill, Helvetica, Optima, Univers, and Venus. Hel-\nvetica typefaces may be the most widely used among the sans\nserif typefaces in the world today (Collier & Cotton, 1989). Sub-\njects perceive san serif fonts as clean, modern and technical\n(Brumberger, 2003).\nSerif fonts as well as sans serif fonts have been designed\nspecifically for use on computer screens. However, sans serif\nfonts are still regarded more legible for screen reading than serif\nfonts (Josephson, 2008).\nSome other typefaces\nScript type style looks somewhat like modern handwriting that\nis carefully executed with a brush dipped in India ink. The indi-\nvidual characters are joined together. It is not possible to use\nscript type for whole words in upper case, or capital letters. Ex-\namples are Constance, Palace Script, and Zaph Chancery.\n82 Black letter type style resembles old German manuscript\nhandwriting. Black letter type is difficult to read and rarely used\nin the USA. Examples are Fraktur, Rotunda, Schwabacher, and\nTextura.\nA more modern classification scheme is the serif-evolution\nsystem. This system provides eight main classes: Venetian, Old\nStyle (Dutch-English and French), Transitional, Modern, Con-\ntemporary (sans serif and square serifs), Black letter, Scripts,\nand Decorative letters.\nMost typefaces are proportionally spaced. Then different\nletters are assigned different spacing in accordance with their\nindividual sizes and shapes. However, on most typewriters and\nsome printers the typefaces are mono-spaced. In such typefaces\nall the letters have the same amount of space. The letter \u201ci\u201d\ntakes the same space as the letter \u201cm\u201d. Proportionally spaced\ntype is usually easier to read than mono-spaced type.\nimh\nNote the differences in character space,\nllllll\nespecially for the letters i and m.\ni m h\nThese characters are set in 40 point\nHelvetica.\nllllll lllll ll\nSize of type\nToo small or too large lettering impairs reading. We read words\nin a text as patterns or even as a series of \u201cword pictures,\u201d not\nletter by letter (Hallberg, 1992; Ingvar and Hallberg, 1989).\nWilkins et al. (2009) found that the size and design of the type-\nface in textual material for children aged 7\u20139 (in the UK) may\nimpair their speed of reading and their comprehension, and\n83 measurement of reading attainment. One study compared the\nspeed with which sample sentences were comprehended. The\nsentences were printed in Arial font with an x-height of 4.2 mm\n(22pt) and 5.0 mm (26 pt) respectively. The sentences were\nverified 9% more quickly when presented in the larger typeface.\nTwo studies compared the font Sassoon Primary with the font\nVerdana and showed that Verdana was read and searched more\nquickly.\nOur perception of size is always relative. According to\nWhite (1987), some 10-point type looks gigantic and some min-\nuscule. It all depends on the design of the face and its x-height.\nLetters can be varied in size and even by type to differentiate\ndifferent types of data (Hartley, 1987). To achieve optimum\nlegibility it is known that letter size must be adjusted to the\nvisual format and the reading distance.\nHeight of character\nThe x-height is the vertical distance equal to the height of the\nlowercase letters such as x (without ascenders and descenders).\nHigher x-heights allow for smaller typeface size, which is just as\nlegible but still is space saving and economical. This is import-\nant in the production of newspapers.\nAccording to Tinker (1963) text smaller than nine points is\ntoo small to be considered legible. Text that should be read in a\ncontinuous manner should be set between nine and twelve Pica\npoints (Benson, 1985; Bernard & Mills, 2000; Braden, 1983,\n1985; Haber and Haber 1981; Tinker, 1963). A twelve point\nnormal type is often suitable. Even after reduction in the print-\ning process to ten point type, the text will exhibit very good\nlegibility.\n84 Height and width vary in different typefaces of the same size.\nThis figure includes Garamond (left), Times New Roman,\nGeorgia, Arial and Verdana (right). The differences in the\nshape and size of the characters will influence legibility.\nIn early readers for children the x-height is typically about\n4 mm. Over the course of five years the x-height decreases to an\n\u201cadult size\u201d (about 2 mm). Hughes and Wilkins (2000) have\nargued that the typeface becomes too small too early in life.\nIn its Publication Manual the American Psychological As-\nsociation (1996, p. 151) recommends a minimum type size of\neight points in figures. The maximum size is 14 points. Accord-\ning to Lenze (1991) font size above twelve points slows the read-\ning process because the reader must examine each letter indi-\nvidually to recognize it. Thus, we can conclude that type should\nbe \u201clarge enough\u201d. A larger type size in a single column is pre-\nferable to a smaller type size in a double column layout. But the\ntext on a display poster should be at least three to five times as\nlarge. A poster might require text that is at least ten times as\nlarge since it is designed to be read from a distance.\nMeasurement systems\nTraditionally the vertical height of letters is designated in typo-\ngraphical points. However the size of such a point is somewhat\ndifferent in various parts of the world. There are three basic\n85 measurement systems used for traditional typesetting, and one\nmain system for desktop publishing.\n\u2022 The Pica system is used in USA and Great Britain.\nHere 1 pica = 12 points = 12 pts = .1660 inch = 4.22 mm.\n1 pt = .3516 mm (72,27 pts/inch)\n\u2022 The Didot system is used in most parts of Europe (except\nGreat Britain and France).\nHere 1 Cicero = 12 points = 12 p = .1780 inch = 4.511 mm.\n1 p = .3759 mm (67.6 pts/inch)\n\u2022 The Mediaan system is used in France.\nHere 12 points = .1649 inch = 4.205 mm.\n1 pt = .3504 mm (72.5 pts/inch)\n\u2022 Desktop publishing systems use a version of the Pica system.\nHere 1 pica = 12 points = 12 pts = 1/6 inch = .1667 inch=\n4.23 mm.\n1 pt = .3528 mm (72 pts/inch)\nIn some situations these differences may be significant.\nThis is the width of 100 Pica points\nThis is the width of 100 Didot points\nThis is the width of 100 Mediaan points\nThis is the width of 100 DTP Pica points\nThis is the width of 25 millimetres\nThis is the width of 1 inch (25.4 mm)\nInitial letters\nSometimes initial letters are larger than the running text. Initial\nletters may be lowered as \u201cdrop caps\u201d or raised as \u201craised initial\nletters\u201d. Because of the possibility to create fancy initial letters\n86 in desktop systems, this medieval practice has become common\nagain (Stokstadand Cothren, 2011). Misanchuk (1992) argues\nthat fancy initial letters are not at all likely to help readers.\nDifferent impressions\nTraditional hot metal type is cast in sizes ranging from 4 points\nto 144 points. Photo-typesetting machines and systems for\ndesktop publishing can produce even larger characters. Sizes of\ntype that are in common use are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18,\n24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72 points. Characters should obvi-\nously neither be too small, nor too large. In the first case we\ncannot read them at all. Legibility is very poor. In the latter case\nwe can only have a few words on each line.\nToo small or too large lettering impairs reading. As an ex-\nample, a text on a poster should be at least five times larger than\na corresponding text in a book. Newspaper print is usually eight\nor nine points. In books ten to twelve points are common. The\nfollowing pages include five examples of a paragraph of text in\nfive size versions: Georgia 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 point type.\nGeorgia 8.

In information design it is\nimportant to find a good balance between our need for a general\noverview and a good legibility of individual words. We need a\nbalance between \u201cnot to large\u201d and \u201cnot to small.\u201d In books,\nmagazines, and newspapers larger type may be used for head-\n88 ings. Below are some examples of the word \u201cinformation\u201d in five\nlarger size versions: Helvetica 18, 24, 28, 36 and 48 point type.\ninformation 18\ninformation 24\ninformation 28\ninformation 36\ninformation 48\nWhich type sizes do you prefer for different headings in a book\nand in a technical report?\nInformation Information\nInformation Information\nFine lines in Times (upper line) may sometimes almost \u201cdisap-\npear.\u201d It is better to use a sans serif type, like Helvetica, when\nthe text is white on a black background (bottom line). Both ex-\namples are set in 14 points.\nOften text is printed with black ink. However text may also\nbe printed in a number of colours. This is especially easy in\ndocuments for the Internet. The use of colour will influence im-\n89 pressions as well as legibility. White text on a black background\nshould usually be larger than traditional black text on a white\nbackground. Fine lines in a Roman type style may sometimes\nalmost \u201cdisappear.\u201d It is better to use a sans serif type when the\ntext is white on a black background.\nSee the sub-section Legibility of colour in the chapter Func-\ntional principles, and the section The message on the screen in\nthe chapter Screen typography.\nStylistic variation of type\nWith respect to line thickness, inclination, and width characters\nin a typeface can be drawn in many different versions. The ma-\njor examples of stylistic variation of regular text are bold, italic,\nand bold italic. The visual weight and visual impression varies\na lot. It may be compared with physical weight. A small and ex-\ntra bold and expanded character may be seen as heavier than a\nlarge, light and condensed character.\nA typeface may be available as light condensed, light, light\nexpanded, bold condensed, bold, bold expanded, regular con-\ndensed, regular, regular expanded, extra bold condensed, extra\nbold, and extra bold expanded. With respect to inclination a\ntypeface may be designed in italic letter style versions. A type-\nface may also be available as outlined, in-lined, and shadowed.\nRegular type is easier to read than uncommon type. Bold-\nface or italics should normally not be used for continuous text.\nItalic print is read more slowly than regular type and is also dis-\nliked by many readers (Tinker, 1965). However, boldface and\nitalics may be used for emphasis. Italics may be used for small\nparts in a running text, for headings, and for captions. Bold type\nmay be used for headings.\n90 Different style manuals have different recommendations\nfor when italic and bold type versions should and shouldn\u2019t be\nused. The use of underlining and all capital letters should be\nrestricted to headings and titles, if they are used at all. Usually\nbold and italics are quite sufficient. Make type big enough to\nstand out from the background and heavy enough to be visible\n(Lipton, 2007). Underlining in the middle of a sentence makes\nthe lower line more difficult to read (Isaacs, 1987). Shadow and\noutline letters should be avoided.\nWords in all capital letters have similar shapes and profiles.\nThe three words \u201cDESIGN FOR CLARITY\u201d (at the top) cover\nrather similar areas. However written with lower case letters\n(at the bottom) the words \u201cdesign for clarity\u201d look quite differ-\nent. (This illustration is based on Futura.)\nReading speed can be substantially reduced when italic text\nis used for continuous prose (Foster and Bruce, 1982). Exten-\nsive use of italic text in continuous prose will impair their func-\ntions to emphasize (Glynn, Britton and Tillman, 1985).\nThe most common type versions are easier to read than un-\ncommon type versions. We should avoid odd type versions like\noutline, shadow, and reverse type like white type on black back-\nground. Boldface and/or italics should not be used for running\ntext but rather for emphasis of important parts of the text. Ty-\n91 pography can be used to modulate a message. Lund (1999) re-\nviewed research literature on the legibility of seriffed and sans\nserif type and concluded that the research is not only inconclu-\nsive, but it is mostly of too poor a quality to be relied upon.\nOther aspects, like lighting condition, and size of type are more\nimportant for legibility. For continuous reading, the typeface\nmust be comfortable to read for longer periods of time.\nWe should remember, though, that content is more import-\nant than form. A text will retain its content even when type de-\nsign is changed. Graphic design can be and should be used to\nbuild consistency and aid communication. Glynn, Britton and\nTillman (1985) reviewed studies on the effect of \u201ctypographic\ncueing\u201d on learning. Typographic cueing generally refers to the\nuse of bold or italic type or underlining to signal the important\nideas in a text. There is little doubt that cueing does work in\ndrawing attention to the cued material. The consensus is that\nreaders are more likely to remember cued ideas than un-cued\nideas (Hartley, 1987).\nThe angle of the thickest part in a curved letter is usually\ndescribed as either diagonal or vertical. It can also be horizon-\ntal. This design feature is called stress of a typeface. For exam-\nple the typeface Sabon has diagonal stress, and Century School-\nbook has vertical stress. Stress reminds of the visual properties\nof writing. It is easy to see the angle of stress by drawing a line\nthrough the thinnest points of the letter o. There is no obvious\nstress in a sans-serif typeface with uniform strokes.\nTypeface personalities\nSeveral scholars have discussed the physical characteristics that\nlead to \u201cperceived personas\u201d and \u201ctypeface personalities\u201d of\ntypefaces. According to Hassett and Curwood (2009, p. 272) the\n92 use of font is a mode of communication that serves as a semiotic\nresource. Research indicates that the presentation of texts af-\nfects the perception of the contents of the message.\nKrause (2007) and Samara (2007) have offered different\nconceptual categories in their taxonomies of fonts, including\nmoods, concepts, energy, elegance, technology and specific\nareas. Machin (2007, p. 87) noted that \u201cletterforms themselves\nhave become more important as part of the overall meaning of\ncomposition and have themselves become more graphic and\niconic.\u201d Typographical features like colour, flourish, formality,\nframing, size, slant, and weight focus on elements of characters\nas well as overall composition. Strategies that support how\nreaders interpret multimodal texts are evolving (Albers, 2008;\nAnstey & Bull, 2006; Serfini, 2010; Serafini and Clausen, 2012).\nSeveral typefaces elicit strong emotions from groups of\nviewers. One example is Comic Sans. This typeface was de-\nsigned for Microsoft based on lettering from comic books, but it\nhas been used in many other situations. Depending on your\npoint of view, Comic Sans is fun, breezy, silly or vulgar and lazy\n\u2013 and many graphic designers and aesthetes just hate it (Steele,\n2009).\nViewers judge the material based on the visual attributes\nversus the meaning of the text (Childers & Jass, 2002, p. 95). To\nensure that the intended message is understood, document de-\nsigners must consider how typography and text present a united\nmessage.\nThere are many different and subjective opinions regarding\nthe personalities of typefaces. With serif type it is easy to follow\ntext lines (Tinker, 1963). Sans serif type is seen as clean, mod-\nern and technical (Brumberger, 2003).\n93 Light type has been described as delicate, gentile, and\nfeminine (Brumberger, 2003), as difficult to read and unprofes-\nsional (Mackiewicz, 2005), and as insubstantial and timid (Van\nLeeuwen 2006). Moderate weight type has been regarded as\nprofessional (Mackiewicz, 2005).\nBold type has been seen as aggressive, masculine and\nstrong (Brumberger, 2003), as difficult to read and unprofes-\nsional (Mackiewicz, 2005), as assertive, daring, domineering,\noverbearing, solid and substantial (Van Leeuwen, 2006), as dar-\ning, overbearing, stable and substantial (Machin, 2007).\nVan Leeuwen (2006) described narrow and condensed\ntype as precise, economical, cramped, and restrictive. Machin\n(2007) described them as cramped and un-assuring. Expanded\ntype was regarded positive light, and providing room to breathe\n(Van Leeuwen, 2006).\nCursive type fonts as well as script fonts are seen as elegant\n(McCarthy and Mothersbaugh, 2002), or organic, personal, and\nformal (Van Leeuwen, 2006). Angular type conveys cultural\nmeanings. It is abrasive, brisk, controlled, decisive, harsh, mas-\nculine, modern, rational, and technical (Van Leeuwen, 2006).\nCurvature in type is perceived as fluid, gradual, maternal, natu-\nral, organic, smooth, and soft (Van Leeuwen, 2006).\nAccording to Van Leeuwen (2006) a flattened type has\nheaviness, inertia, self-satisfaction, and solidity. A vertical type\nhas instability, lightness, and an up-wards aspiration.\nMackiewicz (2005) regarded imperfection in type as friendly.\nAbe Pittman (2012) concluded that regardless of the ability to\ncommunicate technical features of a typeface\u2019s anatomy, view-\ners share an emotional reaction. When selecting typefaces it is\nimportant to consider the amount of text, purpose, intended\naudience and medium.\n94 Van Leeuwen (2006, p. 142) concluded that a new typogra-\nphy has emerged. Typography is no longer a humble craft and\nan \u201cabstract art\u201d in the service of the written word. It is a means\nof communication in its own right and it is spearheading inno-\nvation in graphic design.\nMoys (2011) studied how typography and layout in a selec-\ntion of magazine feature spreads and covers influenced reader\u2019s\njudgments. When it came to typeface participants in the study\n\u201cwere more likely to discuss its treatment than its choice:\nwhether something was in bold, capitals, italics, colour, had a\ndrop shadow or other effects, seemed to influence its distinc-\ntiveness far more than the choice of typeface.\u201d Moys concluded\nthat \u201ctypographic voice\u201d is conveyed through a range of vari-\nables. It is not just a question of establishing a typographic or\nvisual mood. Typography plays a role in how a document is seen\nto address its readers and position itself.\nSelection of typefaces\nThe decision of which typeface to select should rest largely on\nthe purpose and on the intended audience for the document\n(Benson, 1985; Black, 1990). Using the correct typeface for the\njob is based on solving a problem and meeting a need.\nLenze (1991) noted that private documents may invite the\nuse of ornate and stylish looking fonts. Professional documents,\nhowever, require maximum legibility (Benson, 1985; Petters-\nson, 1989; Tinker, 1963).\nAdvertisements must be noticed. Therefore, it is important\nto choose a graphical form that arouses interest. Thus, unusual\ntypefaces can be useful and stimulate attention, entice the\nreader to look at the pictures and begin reading the text.\n95 When it comes to information materials, the graphical\nform should basically be simple and \u201ctransparent\u201d and not\narouse any special interest or attention for its own part. The\ngraphical form should not be too exciting or provocative, nor\nshould it be patently dull. McDougall and Hampton (1990, p. ix)\nconcluded that design and layout should enhance visual and\nverbal content by making it appealing and understandable. It\nshould not be excessively ornamental, thus calling attention to\nitself.\nTo encourage readers to pay attention to relevant informa-\ntion, text designers should help the reader to control his or her\ncognitive processes during learning (Mayer, 1993). To achieve\noptimum legibility it is known that:\n\u2022 Common typefaces are easier to read than uncommon type-\nfaces (Benson, 1985; Paterson & Tinker, 1932; Spencer, Rey-\nnolds & Coe, 1974; Tinker, 1963, 1965).\n\u2022 Serif typefaces are often considered to be easier to read than\nsans serif typefaces, except for small letter sizes (Tinker,\n1963).\n\u2022 Running text should have a \u201cnormal\u201d combination of upper\nand lower case letters. All-capital printing has been shown to\nmarkedly reduce the speed of reading (Henny, 1981; Poulton\n& Brown, 1968; Tinker, 1965).\n\u2022 Without sufficient white space around words in all capitals,\nthe words will become too difficult to read (Kinney & Show-\nman, 1967).\nThe different typefaces have their individual characteristics.\nThey vary in space and in their visual appeal. Some are more\nlegible and some are less legible. In the USA children usually\nlearn to read using textbooks with serif typeface like New Cen-\n96 tury Schoolbook. In European countries it is not unusual that\nsans serif typefaces are used in textbooks. Children in China\nlearn to read the complicated Chinese characters. And we can\nfind equally good readers in all these countries. As a matter of\nfact, the reader should never become too conscious of the type-\nface.\nType can be created in a variety of styles. A change in type\nstyle can signal a change of purpose, a new section, or another\ndegree of importance. Typographical techniques can alert learn-\ners to such things as main ideas, important concepts, rules, sec-\ntions, subsections, and more. However, multiple type styles on a\npage tend to be confusing rather than facilitating. The decision\nof which font or which fonts to use should rest largely on the\npurpose and audience of the document (Benson, 1985).\nSystems for desktop publishing are now common. Software\nthat is easy to handle give the layman the opportunity to com-\nbine verbal and visual messages. This technological revolution\nenables us to do anything we have in mind to do on a page or on\na screen. The mechanical processes of typesetting and makeup\ndo no longer restrict us. Unfortunately, most desktop publishers\nknow little about typography, graphic design, and information\ndesign. With the new systems it is almost too easy to manipu-\nlate a text and make use of all the possibilities to change the ap-\npearance of a page.\nIt is far too easy to create confusion or even a complete\nmess-up. As White (1987) put it: \u201cThe distinguished art and\ncraft of typography developed over centuries by sensitive\ncraftsmen/artists cannot be handed over to an indifferent typist\nkeyboarding a machine (however marvellous the technology)\nwith results of equal excellence and stature. The reader feels the\ndifference in terms of the piece\u2019s ease of reading, charm, and\n97 comfort.\u201d It is wrong economy to cut back on investment in\nquality, believing the readers won\u2019t know the difference. Winn\n(1993) noted that in text, attention is drawn to words or pas-\nsages that stand in contrast to the rest of the body of the text.\nBaggerman (2000, p. 69) pointed out that designers make a\nfrequent mistake when they choose typefaces according to their\nown tastes instead of according to the needs of the users.\nSome common typefaces\nA \u201cgood\u201d typeface might actually be one that is more or less \u201cin-\nvisible\u201d to us as readers (Goldenberg, 1993; Scieszka, 1998;\nMelin, 2011). We shouldn\u2019t be too concerned with the design of\nthe typeface. The typefaces in common use are all more or less\nequally legible (Paterson and Tinker, 1932; Tinker, 1963, 1965).\nHowever, readers are likely to have strong preferences about the\naesthetics of typefaces. One important aspect of the design of a\ntypeface is the perceived size of the individual characters. Some\ntype looks big and some type looks small. This depends on the\ndesign of the characters and their x-height.\nNext to the x-height, the shaping of the various letters is\nimportant. The counters are important for printing and also for\nthe recognition of words. In desktop publishing all parts of the\nletters must be clear and distinct. Clear contrasts increase the\nlegibility, uniformity reduces it. A typeface can influence our\nappraisal of a printed message. Thus, it might be important to\nmake a choice so that typography reinforces the message.\nAs mentioned earlier, thousands of fonts are available. In\nthe practical work with graphic design for information, we need\nonly a few typefaces in different versions. Times New Roman\nwas created for the London newspaper The Times. Today Times\n98 New Roman is available in most computers and used in a large\nnumber of documents.\nCommon font families like Baskerville, Berling, Bookman,\nGaramond, New Century Schoolbook, and Palatino can be used\nsuccessfully for the body text in books. Modern newspaper type-\nfaces include Stone (1987), Swift (1985), Gulliver (1990), and\nUtopia (1989). These are all serif typefaces. Like Times New\nRoman they have large x-heights and good legibility.\nThe following pages present some examples of the same\ntext segment rendered with different typefaces.\nGeorgia\nThe type designer Matthew Carter created the two typefaces\nGeorgia and Verdana for the Microsoft Corporation. They were\nreleased in 1996.\nGeorgia is a transitional serif typeface specifically designed\nfor clarity. It is similar to Times New Roman, but it is larger at\nthe same point size. Georgia has a large x-height and open and\nwide characters. Thus Georgia has good legibility on computer\nscreens, even at small sizes. Times New Roman is narrow with a\nmore vertical axis. Serifs in Georgia are almost horizontal, more\nblunt and wide. The Georgia typeface is very common for run-\nning text in documents at the Internet.\nGeorgia: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP\nQRSVWXYZ,.;:!?\u201d()/&%+-=><*1234567890\nInfology is the science of verbal and visual presentation and in-\nterpretation of information. On the basis of man\u2019s prerequisites,\ninfology encompasses studies of the way a verbal and visual rep-\nresentation should be designed in order to achieve optimum\ncommunication between sender and receiver. Infology models\n99 contain both theoretical (descriptive) elements and normative\n(prescriptive) elements.\nGeorgia has a Times New Roman\nlarge x-height has a large x-\nand open and height, but narrow\nwide characters. characters.\na b c d e f g h i j k a b c d e f g h i j k l\nIn this illustration Georgia is compared with Times New Ro-\nman in the same type size.\nHelvetica\nThe Swiss typeface designer Max Miedinger created Helvetica\nin 1957. Helvetica has endured over time as an example of a\nclean, durable, malleable, rational, and universal typeface. This\nall-purpose font is everywhere, particularly in commercial use\nrepresenting all kinds of brands. It is the ultimate design of the\nBauhaus\u2013Swiss\u2013International schools. Helvetica is designed\nwith simple, striking lines in a compact way. Like Times, Hel-\nvetica has been developed in many typefaces and font versions.\nHelvetica typefaces are very useful for captions, headings, ta-\nbles, and titles, but they might be hard to read in running text.\nThe similarities between upper case I and lower case l cause real\nproblems in words like \u201cIllustration\u201d (See the illustration at\nVerdana). Running text in Helvetica will need extra space be-\ntween the lines. Helvetica is often used for reader slides, over-\nhead transparencies and in business graphics. According to Col-\nlier and Cotton (1989) Helvetica typefaces may be the most\n100 widely used sans serif typefaces in the world today. In this book\nHelvetica has been used for labels and captions within figures.\nHelvetica: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP\nQRSVWXYZ,.;:!?\u201d()/&%+-=><*1234567890\nInfology is the science of verbal and visual presentation and\ninterpretation of information.

He worked together with Victor\nLardent, an advertising designer and draftsman at The Times\nThe mission was to produce a new, first-class and easy-to-read\ntypeface with very good legibility even in small sizes for the\nnewspaper. The production methods for The Times newspaper\nwere far above the world standard at that time. Times New Ro-\nman was designed for hot-metal print and the rotary letterpress\nprinting. Times New Roman combines the classic elegance of\ntypefaces for books with modern demands for economy of\nspace. Several versions of Times New Roman have been devel-\noped. Typefaces and fonts belonging to \u201cthe Times family\u201d are\nall easy to read. They are probably the most widely used serif\ntypefaces in the world. Times typefaces are used in newspapers\nand magazines as well as in books. However, Times New Roman\n101 cannot be successfully used on computer screens, and laser\nprinters cannot print the fine lines in small letter sizes.\nTimes New Roman: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJK\nLMNOPQRSVWXYZ,.;:!?\u201d()/&%+-=><*1234567890\nInfology is the science of verbal and visual presentation and interpre-\ntation of information.

It was specifi-\ncally designed for clarity. Verdana has no serifs, large x-height\nas well as open and wide characters. The spacing between char-\nacters is loose. In contrast to Helvetica similarly shaped charac-\nters have emphasized distinctions.

The paper has its specific bulk,\nfinish, grain, texture, and weight. It may be stiff or floppy. It\nmay be glossy and shining or matte and maybe dull. It may be\nthick or thin. Thin lines, in serifs on small type sizes, may re-\nquire a harder paper than normal lines and larger type. The\nprinting technique used will affect the type of paper needed.\nThe quality of ink is also an important factor in graphical com-\nmunication.\nAll these factors affect legibility and our reading comfort\nand also our perceived value of the product. The degree of con-\ntrast between the colour of the ink and the colour of the paper\nshould be optimum. For text printed in black all paper surfaces\nare equally legible if they have a reflectance of at least 70%. The\nmost legible combination is a black text on a light yellow back-\n103 ground. In a normal reading situation, black print on white pa-\nper is over 10% more efficient than white on black (Pettersson,\n1991).\nCost effective typography\nIf a document is to have many readers who will try to read and\nunderstand it during working hours, the cost of reading the\ndocument will be the greatest expense it incurs. Even though it\nmay be expensive to produce information, it usually costs even\nmore to store, access, and use it. Therefore, the more people\nwho will partake of certain information, the greater the total\ncost will be. Because the cost of reading is closely linked to the\ntype of material in the document and to the various groups of\nreaders it targets, there will be great opportunities to reduce the\ntotal costs and save money by presenting the information in a\nsuitable fashion.\nTo facilitate our work with cost effective typography and\ngraphical form, we may need a number of guidelines, or rules of\nthumb. In an international organization such as a multinational\ncorporation advice and guidelines may be developed according\nto the following criteria and requirements:\n1. The text must exhibit good legibility. Because the typogra-\nphy should provide ease of reading without being \u201cvisible\u201d\n(that is, without arousing notice), we must avoid unusual\ntypefaces.\n2. Our point of departure should primarily be the reader's psy-\nchological capacity for perception, and secondly the poten-\ntial performance of the technical equipment at hand.\n3. It should be as easy as possible for technical writers and edi-\ntors to handle templates for graphical forms. Thus, these\n104 people should be given the necessary training to handle\ncomputer programs and the like where these templates are\navailable.\n4. Size ratios in typography and layout should be based on\nconventions of typography and on research findings in per-\nception psychology.\n5. The typography and layout should be acceptable in many\ncountries, even though national tastes may vary widely.\n6. The typography should be adapted to the technology, that is,\nit should look good when printed on a laser printer, and\nwhen copied on an ordinary office copying machine. Look\nfor, and adopt to the week part in the production chain.\n7. The typefaces should be available as standard selections in\ncomputers and laser printers all over the world. Even so, we\nhave to accept the fact that printouts made by different\nprinters will not be identical in appearance.\n8. The typography should usually be \u201ceconomical\u201d. It should be\npossible to accommodate a great deal of information in a\nlimited space without a crowded appearance.\n9. We should choose typefaces with high x-height for good\nlegibility, even when small type sizes are used.\n10. The typography and layout should produce good results on\nstandard paper. In Europe, the standard paper size is A4\n(210 x 297 millimetres), whereas in the USA, US letter (216 x\n279.5 millimetres) is the standard. We deal with these dif-\nferences by varying the margins on the page.\n11. The dimensions of pages and length of lines are given in\ncentimetre or millimetres. Type sizes are given in \u201cpoints,\u201d\nthe typographical unit of measurement. Note that there are\ndifferent systems in USA and Europe. In the Pica system 12\npoints = 4.2333 mm. In the Didot system 12 points = 4.511\n105 mm. In the Mediaan system 12 points = 4.205 mm. The\nmost common programs for desktop publishing use the Pica\nsystem, giving points as \u201cpts\u201d.\n12. It should be possible to print a document and insert the\npages directly into a loose-leaf binder. This means that right-\nhand and left-hand pages should have the same appearance,\nbasically a right-hand page layout.\n13. If a document is to be reproduced using conventional tech-\nnology, it should be possible to use printouts of it from a\nlaser printer or from a phototypesetter as a basis for direct\nreproduction. When A4 is reduced to 80.4%, the result con-\nforms to the conventional printing format, G5 (169 x 239\nmillimetres).\n14. Before conventional printing, the layout of right-hand and\nleft-hand pages may easily be changed.\n15. All documents might be coded in accordance with the SGML\nstandard, so that it is easy to use the information in different\nways, and in different formats. Sometimes other standards\nmay be used (like HTML, and XML).\n16. Reduction through successive refinement is the best way to\nreach clarity. To create an elegant solution, anything that is\nnot essential to the communication task has to be removed.\nProjected typography\nIn audio-visual instruction and in audio-visual materials, such\nas overhead transparencies, slides, filmstrips, and computer-\nbased presentations, lettering must be considered carefully in\norder to improve legibility. Type must be large as well as bold\nenough to see. In verbal presentations, many of the projected\nimages consist only of text. In written documentation, this type\nof information should be worked into the body of text instead.\n106 (See the book Information Design 2\u2013Text Design for more\ninformation about oral presentations and the use of projected\nimages.)\nOH and PP\nAccording to the standard for OH, overhead transparencies, SIS\n62 23 01 SD A4L, the actual plastic film is 210 x 297 mm. The\npicture surface is 190 x 245 mm, which is a height-to-width\nratio of 1:1.289. Administrative data are put in the 35 mm right\nmargin. The top margin is 15 mm, bottom margin 5 mm and left\nmargin 17 mm. In some organizations there is a need for more\nadministrative data, such as logotype and/or name of the or-\nganisation, name of author, document name, security classifica-\ntion, revision, publication date and document number. These\ndata are put in the bottom margin. Here the picture surface may\nbe 170 x 270 mm, which is a height-to-width ratio of 1:1.588. In\nPowerPoint the height-to-width ratio is 1:1.328. The size of the\nimage can be adjusted to the situation on the computer screen.\nThe layout to the left is the OH-standard SIS 622301 SD A4L.\nThe layout to the right is used in some organizations. This lay-\nout can also be used for PP and other similar systems.\n107 Many speakers use text transparencies, or \u201cword-visuals,\u201d\ncontaining key words in attempting to supply an overview,\nclarify, reinforce, and summarize complicated arguments. These\ntexts must then be brief and concise. They must also be easy to\nread. For good legibility, characters should be large, distinct,\nand bold, not less than six millimetres high when projected in a\nroom the size of a normal classroom. Larger rooms require lar-\nger character sizes.\nNormal text, containing both uppercase and lower-case let-\nters, is easier to read than texts using only uppercase letters.\nOverhead transparency texts should usually consist of black\ncharacters on a light background. Text transparencies are a use-\nful adjunct for a speaker but are sometimes very boring to an\naudience. In verbal presentations, many of the pictures consist\nonly of text. For good legibility of projected text we should con-\nsider the following aspects:\n\u2022 Use no more than six rows of six words each in one overhead\ntransparency. The line distance should consist of the size of\nthe typeface plus 15 to 20% of extra white space.\n\u2022 Maintain a good contrast between foreground and back-\nground. Good colour combinations are yellow \u2013 black, and\nwhite \u2013 blue.\n\u2022 Avoid graduated and tonal background fills.\n\u2022 Overhead transparencies should preferably be horizontally\npresented.\n\u2022 Overhead transparencies should be projected in a correct\nway and not in any way distorted.\n\u2022 Text should have maximum legibility. It may be a good idea\nto use a linear typeface such as Helvetica or Verdana; for ex-\n108 ample 36 and 30 points for headings, 24 points for the body\ntext, and 18 points for texts within illustrations.\n\u2022 Text must also be legible to spectators who are sitting at the\nrear of the hall. The minimum size of letters in overhead\ntransparencies is six millimetres (Helvetica or Verdana 18\npoints).\n\u2022 Restrict stylized and fancy typefaces to opening slides.\n\u2022 Edit the text into sections that are easily read.\n\u2022 Be consistent in the use of uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\u2022 Text should usually be left justified.\n\u2022 White \u2013 yellow, red \u2013 green, and red \u2013 blue are all very bad\ncolour combinations.\n\u2022 A good general guideline for reader slides is to use a light or\na dark background colour appropriate to the content, and\nthen use a colour with good contrast for the text.\n\u2022 Put the necessary identifications data on each transparency.\n\u2022 Check the spelling.\nIn written documentation, this type of information should be\nworked into the body of the text instead. Basically the guidelines\nfor overhead transparencies are also relevant for PowerPoint\npresentations, and other similar systems.\nSlides\nA slide\u2019s subject should appear against a black background. Text\nslides should only be used to a limited degree. Texts should be\nlight (white or yellow) on a dark background (black or dark\nblue). Many colour combinations are hard or even impossible to\nread on a screen.\nAccording to the standard for 5 x 5 slides, SIS 62 23 03, the\nindividual part of the film is 24 x 36 mm. The picture surface is\n109 22,5 x 34,5 mm, which is a height-to-width ratio of 1:1.533,\nwhich is quite close to the golden mean (1:1.618). The actual\nframe is 5 x 0 cm.\nIn verbal presentations, many of the pictures consist only of\ntext. We should consider the following aspects for good legi-\nbility:\n\u2022 Use no more than six rows of six words in each image, set in\na linear typeface, with characters large and bold enough.\n\u2022 Maintain a good contrast between foreground and back-\nground. Good colour combinations are yellow \u2013 black, and\nwhite \u2013 blue.\n\u2022 Avoid graduated and tonal background fills.\n\u2022 Slides should preferably be horizontally presented.\n\u2022 15 \u2013 20 words on a slide is maximum for effective communi-\ncation.\n\u2022 Letters should be medium to medium-bold.\n\u2022 Lettering height should be no less than one 25th of the\nheight of the artwork to be transferred to film.\n\u2022 Upper-case letters are often used in slides. Be consistent in\nthe use of uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\u2022 Restrict stylized and fancy typefaces to opening slides.\n\u2022 Edit the text into sections that are easily read.\n\u2022 Text may be centred.\n\u2022 White \u2013 yellow, red \u2013 green, and red \u2013 blue are all very bad\ncolour combinations.\n110 Screen typography\nCompared with traditional graphic presentations, a presenta-\ntion of information on visual displays such as television sets and\ncomputer terminals is very limited. Still, information may be\npresented in many different ways.\nVisual displays\nVisual displays can be built in many ways. A colour television\nset, an advanced computer terminal, and a liquid crystal display\nall have different characteristics. A television set is built to be\nused at a distance of more than 120 centimetres. A computer\nterminal, however, is built to be used at a distance of 60 centi-\nmetres and has a much better picture resolution than a televi-\nsion set. Our perception of text and pictures on visual displays\nare, of course, to a large extent dependent on the quality of the\nscreen. A videotex terminal simply cannot reproduce a simple\nillustration like a pie chart, since the resolution is only a total of\nabout 5,000 graphical elements.\nComputer terminals are often built with a screen resolution\nof 72\u201382 dots per inch. Today, an ordinary television image\nconsists of about 250,000 image points, or picture elements,\nwhich vary with respect to both grey scale and colour informa-\ntion. High Definition Television (HDTV) uses 1,125 scanning\nlines and can contain five or six times more information than\nthe present NTSC standard colour television system, with 525\nlines. (The European PAL-system has 625 lines.) HDTV devel-\nopments of flat PAL 625 screens will also give increased techni-\ncal possibilities to present text and pictures.\nHowever, visual displays will continue to have a resolution\nfar below a printed page. Some laser printers produce docu-\nments with 1,200 dots per inch horizontally, and 600 dots per\n111 inch vertically. Phototypesetters produce 1,250\u20132,600 dots per\ninch. This is enough to create very small and close raster dots\nand to produce very fine lines in the final print.\nColour displays\nIn discussions on technology, colour is related to measurable\namounts of light. In 1931 an international body called the\nCommission International de l\u2019Eclairage (International Com-\nmission on Illumination), or CIE, defined standards of light and\ncolour. In this context colour primaries are the basic colour\nstimuli used for the synthesis of any colour, by addition or sub-\ntraction. Additive combinations of a very limited amount of ra-\ndiation are used for colour synthesis of a range of colours in a\ncathode ray tube (CRT) and in a visual display unit (VDU).\nA colour CRT is a vacuum tube, enclosing one or three elec-\ntron guns for generating beams of electrons, a system for focus-\ning the beam to produce a spot of visible light at the point of\nimpact on the phosphorous screen, and for electric field deflec-\ntion of the beam, suitable deflection electrodes. The thousands\nof small phosphorous dots are grouped into threes, called tri-\nads, with one dot emitting radiation that appears red, one dot\nemitting radiation appearing to be green, and the third emitting\nradiation appearing to be blue. Red, green, and blue are called\nthe \u201cthree primaries,\u201d RGB. One lumen of white is given by 0,30\nred + 0,59 green + 0,11 blue. Any two primary colours may be\nmixed to produce other colours. Red and green added can pro-\nduce a range of hues around yellow. Green and blue produce a\nrange centred on blue-green, while red and blue mixtures pro-\nduce a red-blue range. The total number of colours that can be\nproduced in a CRT depends upon the number of steps or grey\nlevels obtainable for each phosphorous dot. Advanced systems\n112 are capable of producing up to 256 simultaneously visible col-\nour stimuli chosen from a palette of 16 million. However, in\nmost cases only a few colour stimuli are needed at the same\ntime.\nThe uncertainties in the coordinates of colours are rather\nlarge as a consequence of the heterogeneous distribution and\nefficiency of the phosphorous over the screen, the defects in\nelectron beam convergence, and the departures of the relations\nbetween the values of the colour signals and the digital counts.\nOne consequence of additive combinations in colour television\nis that characters presented in white (the three-colour combina-\ntion) are less sharp than those presented in yellow, blue-green,\nor red-blue (all two-colour combinations). In a similar way, the\nlatter colours are less sharp than red, green, and blue (pure\ncolours). Sometimes colour rims may be seen at the characters\nwith two- or three-colour combinations. The additive combina-\ntion starts in dark adding light to produce colour. Thus, another\nconsequence of additive combinations is that secondary colour\nstimuli will always appear brighter than the primaries.\nLuminance is a photometric measure of the amount of light\nemitted by a surface (lumen/steradian/sq.m.). Radiance is a\nradiometric measure of light emitted by a surface (watt/stera-\ndian/sq.m.). It should be noted that neither luminance nor ra-\ndiance is the equivalent of brightness, which is the experienced\nintensity of light (bright-dull). In colour displays it is very diffi-\ncult to distinguish brightness from lightness (white-black).\nWhen the signal to the display is increased, the brightness of the\ntotal screen is increased. If a signal to a specific part on the\nscreen is increased, the lightness of the area is increased com-\npared to the total screen.\n113 It is usually possible in a CRT to adjust the luminance, the\nhue, and the saturation. Like brightness and lightness, hue and\nsaturation are also psychological dimensions. Hue is the basic\ncomponent of colour corresponding to different wavelengths.\nSaturation is most closely related to the number of wavelengths\ncontributing to a colour sensation. We should always remember\nthat the production of colour, by additive or subtractive meth-\nods, has nothing to do with the actual perception of colours.\nIn a CRT some 8,000 to 20,000 volts of tension are re-\nquired to form an image on the screen. Screens with several\ncolours even require up to 30,000 volts. The electrostatic field\nof the CRT is positively charged. Thus the person sitting in front\nof the screen is negatively charged and a strong field is created.\nThe field affects the movement of dust particles in the air. Since\nthe majority of the particles are positively charged, they are at-\ntracted to the operator. The rate of deposit can reach 10,000\nparticles per square millimetres of skin an hour. Thus skin and\neyes become irritated. People suffering from allergies can ex-\nperience extreme discomfort. The electrostatic field can be el-\niminated with the help of a grounded filter, mounted on the\nscreen.\nThe large magnets used to focus and direct the electron\nbeam on the screen create the electromagnetic field. The elec-\ntromagnetic radiation consists of two components of which one\ncan be shielded. It is not clear as to whether this radiation af-\nfects the adult human body unfavourably. However, it is known\nthat this radiation might be injurious to unborn children when\npregnant women work too many hours in front of the screen.\n114 Interface design\nA human-computer interface is a communications channel be-\ntween the user and the computer. An interface includes both 1)\nphysical components, and 2) conceptual components. Physical\ncomponents are devices for input and output of information.\nInput devices include microphone, touch panels, joysticks,\nspeech recognizers, eye trackers, and data gloves. Output de-\nvices include visual displays and sound or speech synthesizers.\nConceptual components include command languages, menus,\nand typography and screen layout.\nInterface design is interdisciplinary. It may involve facts\nfrom psychology, computer science, information science, engi-\nneering, education, and communications. The information pro-\ncessing model of cognition is used in cognitive psychology. It\nestablishes that: 1) our working memory is limited to five to\nseven \"chunks\" of information; 2) our attention must frequently\nbe refreshed; and 3) recalling information requires more cogni-\ntive effort than recognizing information. Novices and casual\nusers prefer menus to command languages, recognizing an op-\ntion is easier than remembering a command. Touch panels in\ninformation kiosks and graphic displays in most video games\novercome many psychological limitations. They share the \u201cload\u201d\nbetween physical and cognitive activity. Immediate feedback\nand easily reversibility invite user exploration.\nThe psychological theory of mental models, or schemas, has\nalso been applied to interface design. Users develop mental\nmodels for objects, events, and ideas. These internal representa-\ntions are incomplete and often inaccurate, but they help people\ndeal with their systems.\nA common approach in interface design is to define meta-\nphors that links existing user knowledge to the functions of the\n115 system. The desktop metaphor may be the best known example.\nHowever, a more fundamental metaphor is the screen as a scroll\nof paper. Metaphors are useful, but they can also constrain the\nuser's view of the system. Concern with ease of learning can\neventually interfere with skilled use.\nResearch in psychology has led to a number of principles\nfor better interface design. Perhaps the most basic principle is\nthat an interface should be designed around the needs of the\nuser rather than added on after a system has been completed,\nthus serving the constraints imposed by the system. Mar-\nchionini (1991) provided the following seven design principles:\n1. The interface should compensate for human physical and\ncognitive limitations whenever possible. However, the inter-\nface should be \u201ctransparent,\u201d not getting in the way of the\nuser's actions or impeding his or her progress. The interface\nitself should not overload the user with complexity or un-\nnecessary \u201cbells and whistles\u201d that interfere with or distract\nfrom the task at hand.\n2. The physical components of the interface should be ergo-\nnomically designed, taking into account the comfort and\nhealth of the user as well as his or her special needs and\ncharacteristics. For example, a touch panel design for a word\nprocessing program demands far too much arm movement\nfor lengthy sessions, but serves quite nicely in an informa-\ntion kiosk of a shopping mall when positioned to be touch-\nable by users of various heights.\n3. The interface should be consistent. For example, selection\nmethods, positioning of important text and buttons, text\nfonts and styles, and window layout and management\nshould be consistent in all parts of an interface.\n116 4. Non-command interaction styles such as direct manipula-\ntion and menus are preferable to command languages, al-\nthough the expert user should be given \u201ctype ahead\u201d capa-\nbility to quickly move through layers of menus.\n5. The interface should handle errors by providing simple and\nconcise error messages that assist the user in recovery and\nfuture avoidance.\n6. The interface should support reversible actions (e.g., the\nUNDO capability in many systems).\n7. The interface should be subjected to usability testing early in\nthe design process and as each iteration of the product ev-\nolves.\nComputer systems are becoming increasingly interactive, and\nthis trend will continue as new interfaces are developed. Inter-\nactivity will be supported by new input and output devices that\ntake fuller advantage of the many communication channels hu-\nmans employ. The development of interfaces that support\nmultiple input and output devices in parallel will be important.\nFor example an interface that accepts voice and gesture concur-\nrently will give richer control to users who must move about\nwhile controlling systems. Likewise, video and sound output\ntogether provide a more powerful communication channel for\ninformation flow. Intelligent agents are also under develop-\nment. Agents can be assigned specific tasks by the user and then\nsent out to execute those tasks.\nThe message on the screen\nThe message on the screen may consist of text, numeric data,\nand visuals. The layout of the message is important for our per-\nception.\n117 Text on the screen\nThe quality of visual displays is important for our perception.\nColour as well as blank space are essentially free and might be\nused to increase legibility. Experiments with 11,000 judgments\nof perceived reading efforts of text on visual displays (Petters-\nson et al., 1984a) showed that colours presented on colour dis-\nplays are ranked in the same order as surface colours in tradi-\ntional print media. Blue was most popular. The best combina-\ntion is black text on a white or yellow background. Black was\nalso the best background colour, because it has good contrast to\nmost text colours. However, the background colour of a com-\nputer screen should be \u201cfairly light\u201d or \u201cfairly dark,\u201d depending\non the content (Bradshaw, 2001). The text displayed on a screen\nshould have an opposite (\u201cfairly dark\u201d or \u201cfairly light\u201d) colour.\nWhen the screen resolution is average or poor, sans serif is\nmore legible (Bernard et al., 2001).\nA presentation of text on a visual display depends on the\ntype of characters used, the design of the information, the back-\nground, and also the content. The characters may vary with re-\nspect to font, size, lowercase and uppercase letters, colour, and\ncontrast to the background. Legibility of the text depends on the\nexecution of the individual character and the possibility for each\none to be distinguished from all others. People generally per-\nform better with text on paper than with electronic text (Dillon\nand McKnight, 1990).\nThe most important consideration when working with ty-\npography and colour for computer screens is to achieve an ap-\npropriate contrast between text and its background (Carter, Day\nand Meggs, 2007). They wrote (p. 80): \u201dIt has long been con-\nsidered that black type on a white background is the most legi-\nble (combination). While this combination remains an excellent\n118 choice, other alternatives may offer equal if not improved legi-\nbility due to improved digital and printing technologies, and the\nfact that colour is a relative phenomenon. \u2026 Generally, all legi-\nbility guidelines related to working with colour and type in print\napply also to type appearing on a computer screen.\u201d It is also\nimportant to use typefaces specially designed for screen display,\nsuch as Georgia, Trebuchet and Verdana (Bias et al., 2010;\nHoffman, White & Aquino, 2005; Josephson, 2008).\nSubjects generally prefer reading text on paper to reading\nelectronic text on a screen (Dillon & McKnight, 1990; Wright &\nLickorish, 1983). People perform slower and less accurate on\ninstructional tasks when they have to read from computer\nscreens and not from paper (Wright & Lickorish, 1983). Proof-\nreading of text from print on paper is 20-30% faster than proof-\nreading from computer screens (Gould & Grischowsky, 1984). A\nlot of work has been conducted to create legible characters.\nKnave (1983) has given guidelines for the creation of characters.\nA minimum of ten to twelve raster lines per character is re-\nquired. When characters are built by dots in a dot matrix, the\ncharacters will be round or square and not elongated. A dot ma-\ntrix of seven by nine dots is often regarded as a minimum. The\nheight of the characters should be a minimum of four milli-\nmetres for a viewing distance of sixty centimetres.\nSubjects dislike fast scrolling text on computer screens\n(Burg et al., 1982; Kolers, Duchnicky & Ferguson, 1981). For\nmaximum legibility on a computer screen double spaces should\nbe used between lines in a continuous text (Grabinger, 1989;\nKolers, Duchnicky & Fergusson, 1981). Blinking and flashing\ntext can be used as an accenting (Rambally & Rambally, 1987).\nGeneral design rules should be employed also in the design\nof screen displays. Thus material should be arranged and dis-\n119 played so that it is easy to read, from top to bottom and from\nleft to right. A visual display design may vary with respect to\nspatial organization like headings, length of lines, justification,\nspacing, number of columns, number of colours at the same\n\u201cpage,\u201d and directive cues like colour coding, twinkling charac-\nters or words, and scrolling text. Experiments (Pettersson et al.,\n1984a) with 11,000 individual judgments of perceived reading\nefforts of text on visual displays were concluded as follows:\nColours presented on colour displays seem to be ranked in the\nsame order as surface colours in traditional print media. Blue\nwas most popular.\n\u2022 When text is shown on a visual display, there is no easily\nread colour combination. About thirty-five of one hundred\nand thirty-two combinations are acceptable.\n\u2022 The best text colour is black, which causes good contrast to\nmost background colours.\n\u2022 The best combination is black text on a white or yellow\nbackground.\n\u2022 A text can be easy to read in any colour, provided the back-\nground is carefully selected.\n\u2022 The best background colour is black, which has good con-\ntrast to most text colours.\n\u2022 Reading efforts of colour combinations are independent of\nthe sex of the subjects.\n\u2022 There was no difference between colour blind (red-green)\nusers and users with normal vision.\nInverse writing in various colours within a text may be used to\nachieve emphasis. Other possibilities may be a box around a\nparagraph or a change in font or size of letters. Blank space in\nprinted material increases cost, since more paper is required.\n120 Thus, it is not used often. However, colour as well as blank\nspace on a visual display is essentially free and might be used to\nincrease readability. Full text screens in several colours are dif-\nficult to read and quite annoying. What about double spaced\nlines and/or spaces between columns? As stated above, it is\npossible to make rather clear statements with respect to the use\nof colours. However, it is not as easy to give guidelines for the\nother variables.\nStudies of attitudes to various variables (Pettersson et al.,\n1984b) in the presentation of text on visual displays showed\nthat subjects dislike fast scrolling text. This was also found by\nKolers, Duchnicky and Fergusson (1981), and by Burg et al.\n(1982). Subjects seem to dislike more than three or four text\ncolours on the same \u201cpage\u201d. They seem to consider colour cod-\ning and/or twinkling text to be a good way to show that some-\nthing is especially important.\nSubjects also seem to agree that text in uppercase letters is\nharder to read than normal text. According to Kolers, Duch-\nnicky and Fergusson (1981), and Grabinger (1989) we should\nuse double spaces between lines in a continuous text for maxi-\nmum legibility. Attitudes are indifferent to a few design vari-\nables. Thus text on every second line does not seem to make it\neasier to read than text on all lines. Higher characters do not\nseem to be easier to read than standard characters. Half lines do\nnot seem to be better than full lines. A two-column layout does\nnot seem to be better than a one-column layout.\nOther research suggests that margins should neither be\nnarrow nor very wide. Rambally and Rambally (1987) showed\nthat blinking and flashing of a text on a computer screen is an\naccenting technique that will grab the attention of the user.\n121 The background may vary with respect to colour and\nbrightness. Good combinations of text and background colours\nalways have a good contrast. Optimum contrast is often found\nto be 8:1 to 10:1. Most subjects prefer a positive image, i.e., dark\ntext on light background with a minimum refresh rate of 70 Hz.\nCLEA-research (Pettersson, 1984) concerned with per-\nceived reading efforts of text on visual displays and altering\ncolours of the actual equipment found that the close context is\nreally important for the perceived reading effort. The colour of a\nterminal should be rather subdued. The best of ninety combina-\ntions were black text on a white screen with a dark grey termi-\nnal, closely followed by the context colours black, white, and\nlight grey. It was also found that it is an advantage when the\ncontext colour is the same as the colour of either the colour of\nthe text or the background on the screen. The combination of\ncontext and text/background colours must match against each\nother. If they clash the reading effort increases. Further experi-\nments (op. cit.) with altering ambient light levels showed that\nthis is of no or very limited importance for the perceived read-\ning effort.\nNumeric data on the screen\nComputer graphics hardware and software have become widely\navailable. In advertisements it is often stated that business\ngraphics communicate the information effectively, thus being\nvery useful. However, in real-life situations graphics often tend\nto be very poorly designed. Thus they may fail to improve the\ncommunication. Sometimes bad design might even make com-\nmunication difficult or even impossible. Bertin (1967), Cossette\n(1982), McCleary (1983), and Pettersson (1983, 1989) all dis-\ncussed the importance of individual design variables in visual\n122 language. However, these discussions are all based on research\non traditional print media. Ehlers (1984) points out problems of\nlegibility in business graphics. According to him, direction and\npattern and texture of graphic elements appear to be important\nfactors as well as colour and size.\nThe CLEA-laboratory studies of attitudes to different vari-\nables in the presentation of information on visual displays (Pet-\ntersson et al., 1984b) showed that subjects consider it easy to\nsee the difference between vertical bars as well as between hori-\nzontal bars.\nFurther experiments by Fahlander and Zwierzak (1985)\nhave shown that the greater the difference is between the colour\nin a graphic presentation, the more distinct is our perception of\nthe border between the colour spaces. On white background the\nfollowing colour combinations are suitable to use: black com-\nbined with yellow, yellow-red, red, blue, green or the mixtures\nof red-blue (magenta), blue-green (cyan), and green-yellow. On\nblack background the following colour combinations are suit-\nable to use: white combined with yellow-red, red, blue, or the\nmixtures of red-blue. On white as well as on black background\nthe following combinations are suitable to use: yellow combined\nwith red and blue, red combined with blue-green or green-\nyellow, red-blue combined with green or green-yellow.\nFollowing this study Azoulay and Janson (1985) found that\nsome colours used in business graphics have much higher aes-\nthetic values than others. Blue, red, and green are liked the\nmost. In an effort to find some more detailed knowledge about\nour perception of business graphics, two comprehensive ex-\nperiments were carried out with respect to relationships be-\ntween variables and parts of a whole (Pettersson & Carlsson,\n123 1985). The findings, based on more than 2,300 individual as-\nsessments, were conclusive in the following points:\n\u2022 Graphical information is good in conveying a survey of a\nsituation.\n\u2022 When relationships between variables are presented, com-\nparisons of lengths give the best results.\n\u2022 When parts of a whole are presented, comparisons of areas\ncan be used as well.\n\u2022 Design of graphic elements is important to consider. Most\navailable patterns are probably less good. Patterns should be\nsubdued and not disturbing.\n\u2022 Colours like blue, red, and green are liked very much but\nthey do not improve our possibility of reading the message\naccurately.\n\u2022 Different parts in graphic figures should have about the\nsame luminance and radiance. The true differences between\nareas can be hard to see when shaded differently.\n\u2022 When accuracy is needed, graphical information should be\ncombined with actual figures.\n\u201cChoosing the Right Chart\u201d ISSCO (1981) supplies 21 practical\nguidelines and pointers on effective chart design such as: \u201cMake\nbars and columns wider than the space between them\u201d. In a\nstudy Ek and Frederiksen (1986) used the CLEA-equipment to\nfind out about effective chart design. Forty subjects assessed the\ndifference in size between two bars in a bar chart with six bars.\nThe bars had one of three possible widths (1/60, 1/30, and 1/15\nof the screen width). The distance between the bars had one of\nsix possible values, from zero to more than twice the bar width.\nThe bar charts were produced and displayed at random and al-\n124 ways presented with blue bars on black background. The find-\nings, based on 3,600 individual assessments, showed:\n\u2022 The bar width has no influence on our perception of size.\n\u2022 The space between bars has no influence on our perception\nof size.\nThis study confirmed earlier findings (with the perception of\nvertical lines). It can be concluded that we can make screen de-\nsign according to aesthetic appeal. Finally, it may be stated that\nit is extremely easy to convey misleading information about\nstatistical relationships by using misleading illustrations. Those\nwho are serious in their work should seek to avoid these mis-\ntakes.\nVisuals on the screen\nOur perception of visuals on visual displays are of course to a\nlarge degree dependent on the quality of the screen, especially\nwhen pie charts are used. European videotex terminals simply\ncannot reproduce a pie chart since the graphics resolution is\nonly about 5,000 graphical elements. An ordinary television\nimage consists today of about 250,000 image points or picture\nelements which vary with respect both to grey scale and colour\ninformation. Hayashi (1983) reported on the development of\nHigh Definition Television (HDTV) in Japan. HDTV uses 1125\nscanning lines and can contain five or six times more informa-\ntion than the present NTSC standard colour television system\nwith 525 lines. HDTV developments of flat plasma screens will\nalso give increased technical possibilities for better perception\nof the visual information.\n125 Windows on computer displays\nGeneral design rules should be employed also in the design of\nscreen displays with information that is intended to be read on\nthe screen rather than printed out on paper. Thus, material\nshould be arranged and displayed so that it is easy to read: from\ntop to bottom and from the left to the right.\nFor good legibility text in windows on a computer display\nmay be set in 14 point Helvetica or New Century Schoolbook\nwith 16\u201318 point line spacing, and an additional six points of\nspace after each paragraph. The line length may be up to 120\nmillimetres wide. A window heading may be set in 18 points\nbold Helvetica with 24 point line spacing and an additional six\npoints of space after the paragraph. For text in illustrations, I\nrecommend 10\u201312 point Helvetica. Blank space in printed ma-\nterial increases cost, since more paper is required. Thus, it is not\noften used. However, colour as well as blank space on a visual\ndisplay are essentially free and might be used to increase legi-\nbility and readability.\nThe layout of an \u201cideal window for a computer screen\u201d\nshould be adapted to the need of showing both separate video\npictures and video sequences. An ordinary television screen cor-\nresponds with a 60 to 90-millimetres-wide picture on a com-\nputer screen. Thus the window should be at least 90 millimetres\nwide. The layout of the window may be adapted to well-known\npicture sizes, such as: overhead transparencies in accordance\nwith SIS, with the height-width ratio of 1:1,29, television\n(1:1,32), standard film (1:1,33), European A and G series for pa-\nper (1:1,41), Cinema U and IMAX (1:1,44), the effective picture\narea of a slide (1:1,53), the golden section (1:1,62), Vistavision\nEurope (1:1,85), Showscan (1:2,18), and Cinemascope (1:2,35).\n126 The layout of an \u201cideal window for a computer screen\u201d\nshould be adapted for easy transfer of traditional, and page re-\nlated electronic documents into an electronic document. Mov-\ning pictures between different formats and different media\nshould be as easy as possible: documents on paper \u2013 documents\non computer screens \u2013 overhead transparencies \u2013 slides \u2013\nvideo. It is a good idea to only use a limited number of docu-\nment templates with agreed standards for typography and lay-\nout. The agreed layout limits the size of pictures. The picture\nwidth is the most critical; it is often limited by the text column\nwidth. The picture height is limited by the column height, usu-\nally the height of the paper reduced with upper and lower mar-\ngins. Sometimes, there are problems with the picture widths,\nbut almost never with the picture heights. The window height\nshould be adapted to the normal text height, and the height of\nthe most common pictures including captions.\nIn search of an \u201cideal window for a computer screen\u201d a\nsummary of all these criteria, the lowest common denominator,\nresults in an information window (143 x 190 millimetres) with a\ntext and picture area, an \u201cinformation area,\u201d (120 x 160 milli-\nmetres). This active text and picture area has the same side ratio\nas standard film (1:1,33), and almost the same as a television\nscreen (1:1,32).\nEach information material may be regarded as a reel of film\nin a feature film, with film-frames instead of pages in a book.\nContrary to the situation with film, we can with the help of hy-\npertext links move as we wish, from frame to frame in the com-\nplete information material. The window is designed from the\nside ratio 3:4 (1:1,32). This ratio is the basis for the size of the\nhypertext keys (8 x 6 millimetres), for the distance between the\nbuttons (three millimetres), for the placement of the buttons\n127 (six millimetres from the information area and three milli-\nmetres from the borders), and for the placement of the identifi-\ncation texts (six millimetres under the information area and\nthree millimetres above the border). The space above the in-\nformation area is totally nine millimetres. Below the informa-\ntion area, to the left, there are a number of buttons for hyper-\ntext-linked steps to each section (level) in the information ma-\nterial. To the right there are a number of hypertext tools: go to\nthe first page, go one page back, go one page ahead, go to the\nprevious page, go to the page with information on originators,\ngo to list of pictures, go to page with copyright information, go\nto page with a list of illustrations, go to page with an index and\nhypertext links to the complete material, go to the page with\nhelp and explanations, and close the document.\nAbove the information area there is a field with administra-\ntive information, such as the company name, the title of the in-\nformation material, the document number, and the current\nnumber of the \u201cframe\u201d or page. This information only has a lim-\nited value in the electronic document, where all the administra-\ntive information may be put together in the last frame. How-\never, this information is important when printing one or more\nframes. On an A4 paper there is space enough to print one\nframe. The window may be used for one column (160 milli-\nmetres) and also for two columns (40 + 120 millimetres). The\nheader levels number two and three may start to the very left of\nthe window, that is, in the narrow column. Small pictures, sym-\nbols and notes may also be placed here. The full width of the\nwindow may be used for large pictures.\nIn one design experiment as much as 93% of all the pictures\nin a major system description project could be moved directly\ninto such an electronic document. The texts in the pictures,\n128 however, needed to be enlarged from nine to ten, or preferably\nto a twelve point linear typeface such as Helvetica. However, the\ninformation in an information material may well be divided so\nthat the text is shown in one window and all the pictures in an-\nother, similar window on the computer screen.\nThe picture height will be decisive for the use of pictures.\nThere will be some \u201cempty\u201d space both to the left and to the\nright of the picture. After appropriate enlargement, according to\nan enlargement table, both line width and texts usually need to\nbe revised. If we want to work with text only in a window, and\npresent all the pictures in a separate window next to the text\nwindow, we may use a narrower variation for the text. Such a\n\u201ctext window\u201d may measure 143 x 150 millimetres, and have an\n\u201cactive\u201d text area of 120 x 120 millimetres. This window will\nonly contain a text column, with a column width of 120 milli-\nmetres.\nIn WWW the individual user is able to define the size of the\ndisplay window at will. To a large degree the user can also de-\ncide on his or her own preferred typography. Although the\ntypographic possibilities are limited in HTML-documents\n(compared with SGML-documents) it is still possible to provide\na clear structure and make it possible to navigate within the\ndocument as well as between different documents. A consistent\nuse of size and weight in headings is important. This should be\ncombined with a consistent use of empty space to further en-\nhance clarity.\nKeeping a list of contents with links to chapters or sections\nin the current document (or group of documents) in the \u201clist of\ncontents area\u201d makes it possible to maintain an understanding\nof the structure of the present document (or group of docu-\nments). In the \u201ctext and picture area\u201d it is possible to succes-\n129 sively view all the available information. A specific area for ad-\nministrative information can be placed at the bottom of the text\nand picture area. This information will be printed when the\ndocument is printed.\nComputer print-outs\nIn visual displays, an additive mixture of red, green, and blue\nproduces the colour image. However, in the production of hard\ncopies, computer printouts as well as in painting, printing and\nalso colour photography a subtractive method of combining\ninks, dyes and pigments is used. Most colours can be generated\nin printing with the use of yellow, cyan (blue-green) and ma-\ngenta (red-blue). Together these primaries produce black. How-\never, pure black is often included as a fourth printing colour\nbecause the three primaries that produce the best chromatic\ncolours usually do not produce the best black. Subtractive sys-\ntems begin with a white surface. Colours darken as more wave-\nlengths are absorbed. (However, in some colour hard copy\nprinting, both additive and subtractive colour combinations can\noccur.)\nThe difference in the production of colours creates some\nproblems. It should also be remembered that colour coding will\nlose its meaning when monochrome printers, as well as dis-\nplays, are used. There are many hard copy systems and possi-\nbilities to make computer printouts for text as well as for pic-\ntures.\nIn a study (Pettersson et. al., 1984c) printouts from line,\nmatrix, and daisy wheel printers were used. These eight samples\nwere numbered and showed at random to 40 subjects who\njudged their perceived reading efforts of the different texts. The\nresults showed that:\n130 \u2022 Only the two daisy wheel printouts and a normal font, nor-\nmal mode matrix printout cause little reading effort and thus\nare easy to read and quite acceptable.\n\u2022 Reading efforts of print-outs are independent of the sex of\nthe subjects\nIt was concluded from this study and the previous findings (Pet-\ntersson et. al., 1984a) that a text presented in a good colour\ncombination on a visual display was easier to read than prin-\ntouts from several printers used. Today, however good quality\nlaser printers are often used.\n131 Layout\nA finished layout is the practical result of the work in the\ngraphic design process. The purpose of this work is to find a\nsuitable presentation for the content with respect to the re-\nceiver, the subject matter, the medium, and the overall financial\nsituation. Within a given area \u2013 such as a page in a book, a\nposter, or a label \u2013 the graphic designer may arrange and distri-\nbute text, pictures (drawings and photographs), and the back-\nground (margins, space, patterns, and designs without any sig-\nnificant picture elements). Layout provides a large number of\npossibilities to make the structure in a document clear (Benson,\n1985; Tinker, 1963, 1965). The graphical form should help the\nreader to benefit from the contents of a document.\nPaper size\nTraditionally, a large number of different paper sizes were de-\nfined for large sheets of paper. Local paper sizes were defined by\nthe name of the sheet and by the number of times it had been\nfolded. Different paper sizes were used for different purposes.\nThe aspect ratio varies a lot in many standards for paper sizes.\nToday there is one widespread international ISO standard\nand a local standard used in North America. Paper sizes affect\ncards, envelopes, printed documents, stationary, and writing\npaper.\nAll ISO paper sizes are based on a single aspect ratio of the\nsquare root of two, approximately 1:1.4142. The base for the sys-\ntem is the A0 paper. An A0 (A zero) paper has an area of 1 m2,\nwith the sides 841 and 1189 millimetres (33.1 in \u00d7 46.8 in). The\nA-series can be traced back to a French law from 1798 for cer-\ntificate papers.\n132 Successive A series paper sizes are defined by halving the\npreceding paper size along the larger dimension. The system\nwith scaling is a significant advantage. The most frequently\nused paper size is A4 210 by 297 millimetres (8.3 in \u00d7 11.7 in). A\nstandard A4 sheet made from standard 80 grams per m2 paper\nweighs 5 grams.\nSize A0 is 841 \u00d7 1189 mm, A1 594 x 841, A2 420 \u00d7 594, A3\n97 \u00d7 420, A4 210 \u00d7 297, A5 148 \u00d7 210, A6 105 \u00d7 148, A7 74 \u00d7\n105, A8 52 \u00d7 74, A9 37 \u00d7 52, and A10 26 \u00d7 37 mm. The number\nafter A accounts for the number of folds.\nThe B series is less common than the A series. The area of a\nB series sheet is the geometric mean of successive A sheets. The\nB-series is widely used in the printing industry. Many posters\nuse B-series paper or a close approximation, such as 50 cm \u00d7\n70 cm.\nSize B0 (B zero) is 1000 \u00d7 1414 mm, B1 707 \u00d7 1000, B2 500\n\u00d7 707, B3 353 \u00d7 500, B4 250 \u00d7 353, B5 176 \u00d7 250, B6 125 \u00d7 176,\nB7 88 \u00d7 125, B8 62 \u00d7 88, B9 44 \u00d7 62, B10 31 \u00d7 44 mm.\nThe C series is used only for envelopes. The area of a C se-\nries sheet is the geometric mean of the areas of the A and B se-\nries sheets with the same numbers. A letter that is written on A4\npaper fits inside an envelope in size C4.\nSize C= (C zero) is 917 \u00d7 1297 mm, C1 648 \u00d7 917, C2 458 \u00d7\n648, C3 324 \u00d7 458, C4 229 \u00d7 324, C5 162 \u00d7 229, C6 114 \u00d7 162,\nC7 81 \u00d7 114, C8 57 \u00d7 81, C9 40 \u00d7 57, and C10 28 \u00d7 40 mm.\nIn Sweden the ISO system of A, B, and C formats is sup-\nplemented by adding D, E, F, and G formats. G5 (169 \u00d7 239\nmm) and E5 (155 \u00d7 220 mm) are popular for printing disserta-\ntions.\nThe most commonly used paper sizes in North America are\ncalled Ledger, Legal, Letter, and Tabloid. A ledger size paper is\n133 432 x 279 mm (17 x 11 in). A legal size paper is 215.9 x 355.6\nmm (8.5 x 14 in). A letter size paper is 215.9 \u00d7 279.4 mm (81\u2044\n2\n\u00d7 11 in). Letter size is also known as American Quarto. A tabloid\nsize paper is 279 x 432 mm (11 x 17 in). Note that a ledger size\npaper and a tabloid size paper have the same size, but ledger is\nvertically oriented and tabloid is horizontally oriented.\nArch is a series of paper sizes used in architecture. In this\nseries the aspect ratios vary, 4:3 and 3:2 are common. Five suc-\ncessive paper sizes are defined by halving the preceding paper\nsize along the larger dimension. Here the aspect ratio varies\nbetween 3:4 and 2:3.\nArch A is 9 x 12 in (229 x 305 mm), Arch B 12 x 18 in (305 x\n457 mm), Arch C 18 x 24 in (457 x 610 mm), Arch D 24 x 36 in\n(610 x 914 mm), Arch E 36 x 48 in (914 x 1219 mm), Arch E1 30\nx 42 in (762 x 1067 mm), Arch E2 26 x 38 in (660 x 965 mm),\nand Arch E3 27 x 39 in (686 x 991 mm).\nPage composition\nAn \u201cempty\u201d page can be considered as an available area or\nspace. This area may be and should often be used in different\nways. In all printed matter, space can be used to convey the\nstructure of the information. The information can be grouped in\nvarious ways. There may be plenty of white space on a printed\npage. Headings, margins and \u201cempty\u201d space can be used to aid\ncommunication when used in a consistent way (Hartley &\nBurnhill, 1977a, 1977b).\nLearners are most able to build connections between verbal\nand visual representations when text and illustrations are ac-\ntively held in memory at the same time. This can happen when\ntext and illustrations are presented in close connection on the\nsame page in a book, or when learners have sufficient experi-\n134 ence to generate their own mental images as they read the text\n(Mayer et al., 1995).\nAccording to Baggerman (2000, p. 64) most designers don\u2019t\nconsider print design in terms of its interface. However, since\ndesktop publishing has revolutionised the options for page lay-\nout, the professional designer must use the interface of print\ndesign in order to connect directly with the user.\nPage size\nIn traditional as well as in desktop publishing the available pa-\nper defines the possible page sizes. The use of standard page\nsizes can aid communication. Hartley and Burnhill (1977b) are\nstrong advocates of international standard paper sizes. Their\nown experimental materials are printed on A4 paper. We may\nchoose from different kinds of page formats. A quadratic format\nis static. It is often considered uninteresting and it is seldom\nused. Wide formats correspond with our vision. In printed ma-\nterials wide formats may be used to present pictures in large\nsizes. Tall formats are very suitable for presentation of printed\ntext and are the most common format for books. Classical for-\nmats are based on the proportions of the golden section, 3:5,\n5:8, 8:13, 13:21, 21:34, etc. Each new number in the scale is the\nsum of the previous two numbers. Many experiments have\nshown that there is an optical centre on a page.\nIn our daily life we often use A4 paper \u2013 with a width-to-\nlength ratio of 1:1.41 \u2013 for copied/printed matter. The text area\n(the portion of the page that will contain text and pictures)\nshould be large enough, in order for the information to fit in. To\nsatisfy a requirement for single-sided printouts that can be in-\nserted into a loose-leaf binder, while at the same time being able\nto make double-sided printouts that can be bound in book form,\n135 right-hand and left-hand pages should be identical. In a tradi-\ntionally printed book, however, we can use different inner and\nouter margins, and adapt the page layout for even more con-\nvenient reading.\nIf one wants to fill the whole width of the page with text, the\ntext must be written in a large type, with ample distance be-\ntween each line. It is preferable to have narrower lines than\nthat. If pictures are used, it might be suitable to allow them to\nfill the entire text area from margin to margin. Necessary ad-\nministrative information, the chapter title, and the page number\nmay be provided in the lower or upper margins.\nIn documents with only text, or with text and very few pic-\ntures, two columns of text may function very well on an A4\npage. In such a layout, a column width of 80 millimetres with 12\npoints text is quite satisfactory. However, in documents that\nhave plenty of pictures, two or more columns will pose some\ndifficulties and demand a good deal of extra work. As long as a\ndocument is subject to recurring amendment, supplementation\nand other updating measures, a layout with only one column is\npreferable.\nText face\nThe appearance of a book page is governed by the fact that\nWestern readers begin at the top left of a page and read to the\nright, one line of text at a time until they get to the bottom of the\ntext column. Often the main part of the page is the text-face.\nDepending on the page size the page may be used for one or\nmore columns of text and pictures. Hartley and Burnhill (1977a,\n1977b) have done extensive research on psychological research\non typography based on basic principles of typographic deci-\n136 sion-making. They worked with the following three main prin-\nciples:\n1. Use typographic space in a consistent way in order to convey\nthe structure of the information.\n2. Use standard page sizes.\n3. Use grids for pre-planning of pages.\nBy grouping headings, paragraphs, illustrations, and captions\nthe designer aids communication. An \u201cempty\u201d line might sepa-\nrate paragraphs, two lines subsections, and three or four lines\nsections. In this process the principles from the Gestalt theory\ncan be utilized. When we use space to group graphic compo-\nnents, we employ the \u201cproximity principle\u201d or the \u201cproximity\nlaw\u201d. When we use a consistent type to signal a particular kind\nof graphic component, we employ the \u201csimilarity principle\u201d.\nWhen we use grid systems these are based on the \u201cclosure prin-\nciple,\u201d together with the \u201ccontinuity principle.\u201d\nThe classic model for page design\nWhite or \u201cempty\u201d space on a page can contribute to the creation\nof a harmonious and functional product. An old method of de-\nciding the appropriate sizes for margins on a two-page spread is\nbased on geometry:\n1. Draw a diagonal from the lower left corner of the left-hand\npage to the upper right corner of the right-hand page.\n1. Draw a diagonal from the lower right corner of the right-\nhand page to the upper left corner of the left-hand page.\n2. Draw a diagonal from the lower left corner on the left-hand\npage to the upper right corner on the same page.\n137 3. Draw a diagonal from the lower right corner on the right-\nhand page to the upper left corner on the same page.\n4. Draw a perpendicular to the top of the page from the point\nwhere the two diagonals cross on the left page.\n5. Draw a perpendicular to the top of the page from the point\nwhere the two diagonals cross on the right page.\n6. Draw a line from the point where the perpendicular meets\nthe top of the right page, down to the lower left corner of the\nleft page.\n7. Draw a line from the point where the perpendicular meets\nthe top of the left page, down to the lower right corner of the\nright page.\n8. Draw a line to the right, parallel to the page edge, from the\npoint where diagonal 4 and line 7 cross, to diagonal 1. This\nline will establish the top margin on the right page.\n9. Draw a line to the left, parallel to the page edge, from the\npoint where diagonal 3 and line 8 cross to diagonal 2. This\nline will establish the top margin on the left page.\n10. Draw a line, parallel to the page, from the point where di-\nagonal 1 and line 9 cross, down to diagonal 4. This line will\nestablish the right margin on the right page.\n11. Draw a line, parallel to the page, from the point where di-\nagonal 2 and line 10 cross, down to diagonal 3. This line will\nestablish the left margin on the left page.\n12. Draw a line, parallel to the page gutter, from the point where\nline 7, line 9 and diagonal 4 cross. This line will establish the\nleft margin on the right page.\n13. Draw a line, parallel to the page gutter, from the point where\nline 8, line 10 and diagonal 3 cross. This line will establish\nthe right margin on the left page.\n138 14. Draw a horizontal line from the point where diagonal 4 cross\nline 11 to the left. This line will establish the bottom margin\non the right page.\n15. Draw a horizontal line from the point where diagonal 3 cross\nline 12 to the right. This line will establish the bottom mar-\ngin on the left page.\nAs can be seen in the illustration on the next page this method\ncreates large margins, with the text covering only one-third of\nthe page. West (1987) called this model \u201cideal\u201d and \u201cclassic\u201d.\n2 8 7 1\n10 9\n5 6\n12 11\n14 13\n16 15\n3 4\n1 2\nThis is an illustration of the construction of the classic model\nfor page design.\n139 Margins\nMargins have three main functions. They provide space for\ncomments, headings, illustrations, page numbers and personal\nnotes. They provide space for fingers to hold a document while\nreading it. They make it possible to make notes.\nTop margin Top margin\nOutside Inside Inside Outside\nmargin margin\nmargin margin\nBottom margin Bottom margin\nGutter\nThe classic model for page design creates very large margins.\nSurrounding of white space\nThe text-face is surrounded by margins. There are four margins;\na header (or top margin) and footer (or bottom margin), an in-\nner, and an outer or outside margin. Taylor (1960, p. 112) noted,\n\u201ca surrounding of white space will bring attention to any object\nbeing surrounded\u201d. According to Waller (1987), the observa-\ntions on which the Gestalt theory is based form a basic part of\nthe graphic designer\u2019s craft knowledge. These principles might\nbe seen as relatively inflexible perceptual rules that act as a\nfundamental constraint for the typographer alongside such con-\n140 ventional rules as the left-to-right direction of the writing sys-\ntem.\nFooters may appear at the bottom of every page. They\nshould provide information that will help the reader navigate in\na document. Footers often carry page numbers. There may also\nbe footnotes.\nHeaders, or running heads, may appear at the top of every\npage. They should provide information that will help the reader\nnavigate in a document. In some books every left-hand page\nhave the title of the book, and every right-hand page have the\nname of the chapter. Headers may also carry page numbers.\nSize of margins\nA general guideline may be to make all margins one inch on a\nstandard page (Bradshaw and Johari, 2000). However, there\nare a number of exceptions to this guideline and margins. Usu-\nally margins differ in size.\nAccording to Hartley (1985, 1994), Lichty (1989, 1994) and\nMisanchuk (1992) readers expect margins to occupy 40\u201350% of\na standard 8 1/2\" x 11\" page, although this amount can be re-\nduced in professional or scholarly texts. Some guidelines call for\neven larger margins (Burns, Venit, and Hansen, 1988).\nGuidelines for margins vary a lot (Ander, 2003; Bergstr\u00f6m,\n1998; Berndal & Frigyes, 1990; Bohman & Hallberg, 1985;\nHellmark, 2000a, 2000b; Koblanck, 1999; Lohr, 2003; Misan-\nchuk, 1992; Pettersson et al., 2004; White, 1983). Recommen-\ndations for top margins are often between 14 \u2013 35 millimetres,\nfor right margins 6 \u2013 53 millimetres, for the bottom margins 14\n\u2013 34 millimetres and for the left margins 8 \u2013 28 millimetres.\nWith very thick books, the part of the page that is bound\nwill have a section that we cannot see. Thus, thick books need to\n141 have wide inner margins. This part of the page is called the gut-\nter. On a two-page spread the right side of the left page is the\ngutter, and the left side of the right side is the gutter.\nPage numbers\nIn all kinds of reference materials, it is important to have page\nnumbers, folios. The reader can find information in the material\nby using the table of contents and/or the index. Page numbers\nshould be clear and easy to find. There are many possibilities for\nplacement of the page numbers.\nPage numbers can be put to the left, in the middle, or to the\nright in the header or in the footer. Page numbers are some-\ntimes also put in the margin. In products with large page sizes,\nit is usual to put page numbers in the header. In products with\nsmall page sizes, it is quite common to put page numbers in the\nfooter. Usually readers are likely to look for page numbers in the\nmargin at the bottom of the page (Lipton, 2007, p. 134). How-\never, this should not to be considered a rule. The important\nthing is consistency.\nPage numbers indicate arbitrary divisions of the text. For\ntechnical reasons many books contain more than one series of\npage numbers. For example, technical manuals and instruc-\ntional materials often use a separate numbering series for each\nchapter. Then a single chapter can be updated without reprint-\ning the whole manual. The running head includes the name of\nthe publication, the issue date, or other header or footer style\nmaterial.\nGrid systems\nLook at different books, reports, magazines, and papers and\nstudy the variety of page sizes and page designs. In many books\n142 the page has only one column, which is very good for undis-\nturbed and easy reading. However, a wide page has to be di-\nvided. Too wide lines impair reading. Book pages with two col-\numns are quite common. Even three columns can be used, e.g.,\nin dictionaries and reference books. Pages with four or more\ncolumns are very rare. One-column layouts are the most used\nlayouts in instructional materials. It is easy to work with, espe-\ncially when materials may have to be revised frequently. Davies,\nBarry, and Wiesenberg (1986) suggest that one, two, or three\ncolumns per 8 1/2\" x 11\" page are reasonable for reports, pa-\npers, and other similar documents.\nIn magazines it is common that different sections have their\nindividual page designs. One section may have three columns,\nanother section four columns, and a third section five columns.\nPages with six or more columns are very rare. In newspapers it\nis common that a page has six, seven, or eight columns. News-\npaper pages with four or five as well as with nine or ten columns\nmay also be used. Pages with eleven or more columns are very\nrare. It is very easy to create complicated typography and page\nlayout. However, simplicity and consistency are very important.\nComplexity usually interferes with communication. Readers\nshould not be forced to search on the page for headings and\npage numbers. Typographic grids may be used to ensure that\nspace and print are used consistently. It is important that the\nprinted page provide a reliable frame of reference from which\nthe learner can return without confusion. By dividing a page\ninto smaller sections, a specific topic may be presented in a\nvariety of combinations of grid sections. A grid establishes a\nstructure to build upon. There are different kinds of grid sys-\ntems. We can distinguish between one-column grids, multi-\ncolumn grids, modular grids, and irregular grids. Many books\n143 and other documents use a standard page with a fixed text-face,\na live area. Type and other graphic elements occupy the text-\nface. The grid establishes the location of the text-face, the inner\nand outer margins, the header, and the footer on each page.\nTraditionally graphic designers work with grid sheets\nprinted in light blue ink. The \u201cnon-repro\u201d blue ink will not show\nup on films, printing plates, or on the final print. The grid is\nused to ensure that type and graphic elements are pasted on\ncorrect locations. In electronic page layout systems the software\ncan create electronic grids. They are called master pages. A mas-\nter page is shown on the screen but does not print. In columnar\ngrids the text flows from one column to another. Dictionaries\nand telephone directories are examples of simple columnar\ngrids. In parallel columnar grids the text flows in columns that\nare related horizontally. This system is sometimes found in\nmultilingual manuals with the same text in different languages.\nThe modular grid is the classical Swiss grid. It is based on\nregular rows as well as columns. Often a modular grid system is\nused for \u201cblocked grids\u201d. For example, it is possible to use col-\numns with different widths to present texts and illustrations.\nUsually \u201ctopic frames\u201d are rectangular. The purpose is to create\nclear visual gestalts. Many tabloid newspapers use irregular\ngrids. The topic frames are often not rectangular. Editorial stor-\nies are mixed with advertising items. The purpose of irregular\ngrids is actually to prevent clear visual gestalts. The reader can\nnever get an understanding of the page at only one glance.\nEffective grid-based design requires both careful planning\nand a willingness to adjust to the content itself when this is\nneeded. Fitting the content to the grid should be seen as a way\nof regularizing the information and increasing its internal con-\nsistency in order to improve communication.\n144 Oppositions\nBy tradition page layout is based on symmetrical page design.\nCentred as well as justified texts are examples of symmetrical\nlayout. Symmetry is axial balance. It is logical and simple to de-\nsign. Symmetrical page design is static and may be perceived as\nboring. An asymmetrical layout can be based on contrasts of\nsize, strength, shape, area, or colour. Unjustified text flushed\nleft or right are examples of asymmetrical layout.\nSymmetrical as well as asymmetrical layouts can have a\ngood balance. The favouring of uniformity in the use of design\nelements is regularity. The opposite, called irregularity, em-\nphasizes the unusual and unexpected. A layout may be built on\nsimplicity using few and simple elements and simple forms.\nThe opposite strategy is based on complexity. Dondis (1973)\ndiscussed the use of several pairs of oppositions as techniques\nfor visual communication. These oppositions are:\nBalance \u2013 Instability\nSymmetry \u2013 Asymmetry\nRegularity \u2013 Irregularity\nSimplicity \u2013 Complexity\nUnity \u2013 Fragmentation\nEconomy \u2013 Intricacy\nUnderstatement \u2013 Exaggeration\nPredictability \u2013 Spontaneity\nActiveness \u2013 Stasis\nSubtlety \u2013 Boldness\nNeutrality \u2013 Accent\nTransparency \u2013 Opacity\nConsistency \u2013 Variation\nAccuracy \u2013 Distortion\n145 Flatness \u2013 Depth\nSingularity \u2013 Juxtaposition\nSequential \u2013 Random\nSharpness \u2013 Diffusion\nRepetition \u2013 Episodic\nThese different visual design techniques overlap and reinforce\nmeaning. They present the graphic designer with effective\nmeans of making expressive visual communication.\nText layout\nLupton and Miller (1999, p. 33) started their chapter about Pe-\nriod Styles in this classical way:\nGREEKANDLATINMANUSCRIPTSWEREUSUALLYWRITTEN\nWITHNOSPACEBETEENWORDSUNTILAROUNDTHENINT\nHCENTURYADALTHOUGH.ROMAN.INSCRIPTIONS.LIKET\nHE.FAMOUS.TRAJANCOLUMN.SOMETIMES.SEPARATED.\nWORDS.WITH.ACENTERED.DOT. ...\nToday graphic designers use typographic variation to present\nthe content in a text in a clear way. Reference materials, such as\ntelephone books and dictionaries are examples of highly struc-\ntured information. Here, a carefully thought-out, functional\nlayout can facilitate the reader\u2019s ability to find the desired in-\nformation quickly, easily, effectively, and reliably.\n146 There are vast possibilities of text design. The whole page may\nbe used for one column of text. The left or the right margin\nmay be wide to leave space for notes. The text-face may also be\ndivided into two or more columns.\nThe text may start down the page in each new chapter. Sub-\nheadings are often located within the text column, but they\nmay poke out in the margin. There may also be printed notes\nin the margin.\nText must have a typography that facilitates its legibility.\nHeadings, sub-headings, main text, captions, boxes, summaries,\netc., must be clearly distinguished from one another. For re-\nports, and similar documents, it is reasonable to use one, two,\nor three columns on the page (Hartley & Burnhill, 1977a,\n1977b). Consistent use of columns will help to establish a regu-\nlar pattern throughout a project (Lipton, 2007, p.120).\n147 In typography a \u201cwidow\u201d is the first line of a paragraph\nalone at the bottom of a column. Sometimes a widow refers to\nthe last line of any paragraph with only a few words. The first\nline of a paragraph should not, as a rule, begin on the last line of\na text column. Similarly, the last words in a paragraph should\nnot be placed alone at the top of a new page or a new column.\nMany word processing programs automatically eliminate awk-\nward phenomena like these. An \u201corphan\u201d is the last line of a\nparagraph when it is alone at the top of a column.\nIn some documents lines need to have numbers. Non-\narbitrary numbering systems include the numbering of lines\nwhere line endings are meaningful. This might be the case in\ncomputer programs, in dictionaries, and in texts used for lin-\nguistic analysis. Non-arbitrary numbering systems also include\nthe numbering of paragraphs and the numbering of headed sec-\ntions.\nJustified or unjustified text?\nA text may be justified or unjustified. An unjustified text can be\nflushed left, centre justified, or flushed right. There are some\nadvantages and some disadvantages with each system. The fol-\nlowing pages include four examples of the same text fragment in\nthe four different versions: justified text, centre justified text,\nflushed left text, and flushed right text.\nJustified text\nA number of authors argue that justified text (sometimes called\nright-justified text or full text) is aesthetically pleasing and that\nit is easier for people to read lines of the same length than read-\ning lines with markedly varying right-hand ends (Lang, 1987;\n148 Lichty, 1994). Justified text is commonly used for running text\nin books, magazines, and newspapers.\nTo achieve a justified text the technical system inserts extra\nspace between words and between characters. According to\nKleper (1987). The practice of having text justified is a tradition\nin the publishing industry that originated with the scribes who\ncopied text by hand before the invention of movable type. At\nthat time paper was expensive and the scribes attempted to put\nas much text as possible onto every page, filling each line com-\npletely.\nThe blue text fragment below is justified\nInfology is the science of verbal and visual presentation and in-\nterpretation of messages. On the basis of man\u2019s prerequisites,\ninfology encompasses studies of the way a combined verbal and\nvisual representation should be designed and produced in order\nto achieve optimum communication between a sender and a\ngroup of receivers. Infology models contain both theoretical\n(descriptive) elements as well as normative (prescriptive) ele-\nments.\nBurns, Venit, and Hansen (1988) pointed out that the use of\nmetal type required that the right edges of type align in the page\nform so that the type could be locked into place. Until recently\nmost publishers had regarded anything other than justified text\nas unprofessional. Lang (1987) argued that justified text is aes-\nthetic, it serves to define the right margin, and it is familiar to\nthe readers. Also Lichty (1989) argued that it is easier to read\nlines of the same length than lines with markedly varying right-\nhand ends. According to Machin (2007) justified text may be\nseen as authoritative, efficient and formal.\n149 Hartley (1985) and Hartley and Burnhill (1977a) argued\nthat justified text is not a good idea for instructional materials.\nThe variable spacing between words as well as the use of hy-\nphenation makes reading less smooth and more difficult.\nWhen justified text is set in too short lines, there will be\n\u201crivers of space\u201d between words, or characters spaced out to fill\nthe lines. Justification should be avoided with narrow columns\nin multi-columnar layouts (Davies, Barry, and Wiesenberg,\n1986). Misanchuk (1992) claims that there are no good argu-\nments at all for using justified text.\nCentre justified text\nSymmetrical centre justified texts may be seen as formal, grave\nand momentous ((Machin, 2007). However, without symmetry\ncentre justified texts may be seen as energetic, informal and\nplayful. Symmetrical centre justified texts are often used for\nmenus, quite often used for poetry, and sometimes used for\nshort captions and tables of contents. In films and in television\nprograms the participants are usually listed centre justified.\nThis blue text fragment below is centre justified\nInfology is the science of verbal and visual presentation and in-\nterpretation of messages.

Infology models contain both theoretical\n(descriptive) elements as well as normative (prescriptive) ele-\nments.\n150 Flushed left text\nToday flushed left text, or unjustified text; with a \u201cragged\u2013\nright\u2013hand\u201d edge is commonly used for running text in books,\nmagazines, and some newspapers. A century ago flushed left\ntext was restricted to poetry. At that time it was considered very\nodd and peculiar and most publishers regarded the use of any-\nthing other than justified text as unprofessional. According to\nMachin (2007) flushed left text may be seen as less formal and\nmore relaxed than justified text.\nSome authors argue that flushed left text is a much better\nchoice than justified text (Hartley, 1994; Misanchuk, 1992). The\nexact spacing between letters and between all the words in un-\njustified text retains the optimal spacing between letters and\nbetween words and so keeps the visual rhythm constant. This\naids reading, especially for young, inexperienced and poor read-\ners (Gregory and Poulton, 1970; Zachrisson, 1965).\nThis blue text fragment below is flushed left\nInfology is the science of verbal and visual presentation and\ninterpretation of messages.

Infology models contain both theoretical\n(descriptive) elements as well as normative (prescriptive) ele-\nments.\nTrollip and Sales (1986) experimented with justified and\nflushed left text. Results indicated significant increase in read-\ning time for groups reading justified text. No differences in\ncomprehension were detected. Poor readers have difficulty\n151 reading justified text (Gregory and Poulton, 1970; Zachrisson,\n1965). However, whether the text is justified or unjustified\ncauses no significant difference in search time and comprehen-\nsion of the information for advanced readers (Hartley, 1987).\nHowever, many readers find justified text much more aes-\nthetically pleasing than flushed left text. They may even feel that\nthe ragged right is ugly and repulsive.\nFlushed right texts\nFlushed right texts can be used for captions that are positioned\nto the left of the pictures, and for tables of contents. This is,\nhowever, only possible when the line length is short. Since\nflushed right texts demands more effort to read they suggest\nmore confidence than justified texts (Machin, 2007).\nThis blue text fragment below is flushed right\nInfology is the science of verbal and visual presentation and\ninterpretation of messages. On the basis of man\u2019s prerequisites,\ninfology encompasses studies of the way a combined verbal and\nvisual representation should be designed and produced in order\nto achieve optimum communication between a sender and a\ngroup of receivers. Infology models contain both theoretical\n(descriptive) elements as well as normative (prescriptive) ele-\nments.\nRegardless of justification system the ends of sentences should\nbe determined by syntax rather than by an idea of a set width of\nthe line (Hartley, 1980; Bork, 1982).\nLine length\nIt is easy to change the length of lines. According to Tinker\n(1963), readers tend to dislike both very short and very long line\n152 lengths. Tinker made extensive studies of typography. He\nworked with characters in sizes of nine to twelve Pica points and\nrecommended ten to twelve words per line. This results in a line\nlength of eight to ten centimetres. There are, however, several\nother recommendations of line length.\nWest (1987) suggested that the line length should be 35\u201340\ncharacters. Quite often the optimum line length seems to be\nabout 1 1/2 alphabets \u2013 42 characters (Pettersson, 1989;\nWalker, 1990). This is nine to eleven centimetres with optimum\ncharacter size, ten to twelve points, at a normal reading dis-\ntance. Lipton (2007) suggested 40\u201350 characters and Parker\n(1988) 50 characters. Burns, Venit, and Hansen (1988), and\nZwaga, Boersma and Hoonhout (1999) suggested up to 60 char-\nacters. Miles (1987) suggested 60\u201365 characters. A text column\nmay be widened up to 120\u2013130 millimetres to accommodate\nmore text, and still be easy to read for an experienced reader. It\nis quite clear that too wide lines impair reading.\nIn my opinion the maximum line length should not be\nmuch more than 60\u201370 characters. This is except for books in-\ntended for highly skilled readers. The optimum line length\nshould be found for each individual purpose and each audience.\nHowever, costs often force people to use more characters on\neach line, so that the total number of pages can be reduced. The\nlonger the lines the wider the vertical space between them needs\nto be (Waller, 1987).\nThe length of a line will affect reading speed (Duchnicky\nand Kolers, 1983). Different kinds of publications should use\ndifferent line lengths. The optimum line length should be found\nfor each individual purpose and audience. The width of a line of\ntype is traditionally measured in picas or Cicero. A pica, as well\nas a Cicero, equals 12 points. As systems for desktop publishing\n153 become more common, line lengths will be measured in inches\nor centimetres instead of picas or Cicero\u2019s.\nThe line length may vary considerably. The longer the line\nis, the larger the type size should be. The shorter the line is, the\nsmaller the type size can be. If justified text is set in lines too\nshort, you get rivers of space between words, or characters\nspaced out to fill. Following on the next pages are examples of\ndifferent line lengths with the same type size; too short lines,\nshort lines, optimum line length, and long lines. All examples\nare given with unjustified as well as with justified lines. All ex-\namples use the same rules for hyphenation. In all examples the\nshortest prefix as well as the shortest suffix is set to three char-\nacters in UK English.\nHowever, Zwaga, Boersma and Hoonhout (1999, p. xxii) ar-\ngued that there is no such thing as the \u201cbest\u201d column width or\nline length. The typographic features of printed matter should\nbe chosen in relation to the requirements of the material to be\nprinted. Line length can be relevant in the context of material\nconsisting of sentences grouped in paragraphs, but as less im-\nportant when there are also components such as tables, lists,\ndiagrams and mathematical formulae. In these cases the con-\nstraints of a narrow column might be a disadvantage.\n154 Too short lines 1 Too short lines 2\nProducers of in- Producers of in-\nformation and formation and\nlearning materials learning materials\ncan facilitate can facilitate\ncommunication, communication,\nand the learning and the learning\nprocesses of the processes of the\nreaders.

Active voice, clarity, comprehensibility, consis-\ntency, legibility, precision, readability, reading value, simplicity, and structure are the key\nconcepts in information design. Any graphical message should be legible, readable, and\nwell worth reading for the intended audience.\nAs we can see from these examples, short lines cannot handle\njustified setting very well. The distance between the words is too\nlong. We get white \u201crivers\u201d of space in the text column. A line of\n40 to 50 characters or \u201cstrokes\u201d results in a line length of 75 to\n90 millimetres in a book or a paper. A text column may be wi-\ndened up to 120 millimetres to accommodate more text, and\nstill be easy to read for an experienced reader. This column is\n120 millimetres.\nInterline distance\nThe \u201cinterline distance,\u201d \u201cinterline spacing,\u201d \u201cline space,\u201d or\n\u201cvertical spacing\u201d is the vertical distance between the baselines\nin a text. In Times an 11-point text may be set on a 13-point line.\nThis is written as 11/13, and read as \u201celeven on thirteen.\u201d The\nterm \u201cleading\u201d refer to the extra space between the lines, the\n157 \u201dline\u2013to\u2013line\u201d spacing. In this case the interline distance is 13\npoints, and thus the leading is two points. The leading may vary\nconsiderably between different kinds of texts. In this column\nthe text is set with Georgia 10/16. Georgia needs more space\nthan Times.\nThe term leading is derived from the days of hot metal type\nwhen thin strips of lead were placed between lines of type to\nprovide line spacing. However, today the word leading is some-\ntimes used to measure the vertical distance between the base-\nlines in a text.\nExtra space is important for legibility. As previously noted\nthe longer the lines, the larger the vertical distance should be.\nThe reader needs to be able to find the next line without any\ntrouble. In general, the opinion is that as the line length is in-\ncreased, the need for more leading and larger type increases\n(Lipton, 2007; Misanchuk, 1992; Pettersson, 1989). Here the x-\nheight is important. Typefaces with small x-heights manage well\nwith less leading than typefaces with large x-heights.\nFor maximum legibility of the running text in a book a lead-\ning should be between one to three points when text size and\nline length are optimal (Benson, 1985; Hartley, 1987; Kleper,\n1987; Lichty, 1989; Lipton, 2007, p. 124; Pettersson, 1989, Tin-\nker, 1963). Texts on wall charts and overhead transparencies\nneed more space between the lines. Children and inexperienced\nreaders need more leading than experienced readers. Typefaces\nwith small x- heights manage well with less leading than type-\nfaces with large x-heights.\nHere are six examples of a text fragment with ten short\nlines. Georgia 12/10 is compared with 12/12. Georgia 12/14 is\ncompared with 12/16, and 12/18 is compared with 12/20. For\n158 better and easier comparisons the left example in each pair is\nflushed right and the second example is flushed left.\nGeorgia 12/10 Georgia 12/12\nInfology is the science of Infology is the science of\nverbal and visual presenta-\nverbal and visual presenta-\ntion and interpretation of\ntion and interpretation of\nmessages.

Thus, a line with 12 point\ntype needs an interline distance of at least 2 points (Times) or\n3\u20134 points (Georgia). Generally speaking, one can use the type\nsize plus 15\u201330% to determine this ratio.\nSpace\nSpace is an important tool in typography (Hartley, 1985, p. 27):\n\u201cIt is space that separates letters from each other. It is space\n(with punctuation) that separates phrases, clauses and para-\ngraphs from each other; and it is space (with headings and sub\nheadings) that separates subsections and chapters from one\nanother.\u201d Consistent spacing in a document will help the read-\ners to:\n\u2022 Increase the rate of reading because they are more able to\nsee redundancies.\n\u2022 Access the more personally relevant pieces of information.\n\u2022 See the structure of the document.\nSpace between words\nSpace between words varies in each line depending on the ac-\ntual words and the actual line length. First the computer system\nadds word spacing and then, if the space between words be-\ncomes too excessive, the system will add letter spacing.\nThe distance between words shall be smaller than the dis-\ntance between lines, and larger than the distance between char-\nacters. According to Walker and Reynolds (2004) a word space\nthat is too wide or too narrow can ruin the design of a font.\nSpace between elements should be used as a legibility tool (Lip-\nton, 2007, p. 122). Text with a generous amount of space within\nit is rated as \u201ceasier\u201d and \u201cmore interesting\u201d than text that has a\n161 more solid appearance. For comfortable reading it must be easy\nto distinguish between words. The distance between words\nshould be relatively small. When the text has optimal spacing\nwe can keep the reading rhythm constant.\nWendt (1979) inserted additional space between the con-\nstituents of the sentences to better convey the phrase structure\nof the text but found no difference in learning efficiency when\ncompared with traditional text in one or in two columns.\nSpace between letters\nThe amount of space between letters in a text varies in each line\ndepending on the actual words and the actual line length. Space\nbetween letters in text should not be too loose, or too tight.\nVisual design should be based on perceptual, rather than on\nphysical phenomena. Compensation for shortcomings of our\nhuman vision is often required. Acute and rounded shapes need\nto be enlarged and extended in order to appear to be of equal\nheight compared with a square. Visual alignment depends on\ncareful optical adjustment to compensate for differences in\nshape of the element being aligned.\nAcute and round shapes appear to be too low compared with a\nrectangle or a square.\nWalker and Reynolds (2004) showed school children four\ntexts with varying letter spacing and four texts with varying\n162 word spacing. Results showed that more children noticed dif-\nferences in letter spacing than differences in word spacing.\nThe distance between characters is sometimes too long.\nThis is especially true for headlines in capitals. In traditional\nhand typesetting people used thin strips of metal, from 0.5\npoint upwards, for \u201ccorrect\u201d spacing of type.\nIn computer systems \u201cempty space\u201d is added automatically\nbetween the words and between individual letters when the text\nis set with justified lines. In photo typesetting it is possible to\nautomatically and systematically increase the distance between\ncharacters in order to expand the text. It is also possible to re-\nduce the distance between characters in order to condense the\ntext. This is also possible in some systems for desktop publish-\ning.\nKerning\nIn photo typesetting, and in some systems for desktop publish-\ning, kerning is used to individually correct the distance between\ncharacters to achieve a better type. For example, when a capital\nA and a capital V are set without kerning, there is too much\nspace between the letters. The A and V have slanted shapes, and\nthe space between these letters is exaggerated.\nWith kerning, selected pairs of letters can be pushed to-\ngether and overlap to create a better optical visual spacing be-\ntween the letters. In optical spacing we need to equalize the area\nrather than the distance between characters. In typography, the\ntightest letter spacing is reserved for adjacent characters with\ncurved edges or horizontally projected strokes. The widest spac-\ning is allotted to character pairs with adjacent vertical strokes.\nHewson (1988) noted that it isn\u2019t worthwhile kerning any\ntype under 18 points. Kerning is important for headings in\n163 books, handouts, pamphlets, reports and other printed docu-\nments, and also for texts on OH transparencies, PP presenta-\ntions and wall charts.\nA W A Y\nAWAY\nThere may be too much space between the letters in large fonts\n(upper example). Here it is necessary to apply kerning (lower\nexample) and correct the distances between characters to\nachieve a more legible type.\nHyphenation\nLines can be broken according to different principles. According\nto one principle, lines can be broken only between words. Ac-\ncording to another principle, lines can be broken also within\nwords. This can be done phonetically or according to etymology.\nIn mechanical word breaks, lines are broken at the most con-\nvenient point, regardless of meaning. It is known that poor\nreaders have difficulty reading hyphenated text (Gregory and\nPoulton, 1970; Lichty, 1989; White, 1983). Misanchuk (1992)\nprovides guidelines for hyphenation.\n164 Rules\nVertical and horizontal straight lines that are used in typogra-\nphy and layout are called rules. Horizontal lines can be used to\nseparate sections in a text and rows in a table. Vertical lines can\nbe used to separate columns of text on a page or columns in a\ntable. It is; however, often better to use white space as a sepa-\nrating device. Rules wider than 12 points are called bars or\nbands. Sometimes horizontal bars have type in them. Rules may\nbe in colour.\nHeadings\nHeadings, or headlines, attract the attention of the readers, en-\nhance the hierarchic structure, make the subject matter readily\napparent, and indicate the relative importance of items.\nShow structure\nHeadings should be used to make the subject matter readily\napparent, and indicate the relative importance of different items\nin the document (Cisotto and Boscolo, 1995; Jonassen, 1982;\nMayer, 1993). Composition, intentional use of size, space, and\nplacement of headings enhance the hierarchic structure in in-\nformation material and help the readers to get the message\n(Jonassen, 1982; Wileman, 1993, p. 88). Headings should al-\nways be relevant and identify the subject matter. The purposes\nof headings are to attract the attention of the readers, make the\nsubject matter readily apparent, and indicate the relative im-\nportance of items. Headings in large type may be printed in col-\nour. In order to increase the contrast it is a good idea to use lar-\nger as well as bolder type when headings are printed in colour.\n165 Headings on different hierarchic levels will provide the\nreaders with reference points and help them organize informa-\ntion cognitively for better retention and recall.\nTo achieve a clear structure we can use a combined num-\nbering and lettering system (Jonassen, 1982). Main points in a\ntext are traditionally labelled with Roman numerals (I, II, III,\nIV etc.). Sub-points of the first degree are traditionally labelled\nwith capital letters (A, B, C, D etc.). Second-degree sub-points\nare traditionally labelled with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).\nThe labelling hierarchy is I., A., 1., a., (1), (a). In Europe it is\ncommon to use a numbering system only (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,\n1.4; 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4; 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 etc.).\nSize and style\nWe can vary the type size and/or use different type versions.\nAccording to a rule of thumb, called the \u201cRule of X\u2019s,\u201d the height\nof the uppercase X of a smaller typeface should be the same as\nthe height of the lower-case x of a larger typeface in a hierarchy.\nFor a ten point running text headings may be 10, 14, 18 and 24\npoints. For a twelve point running text headings may be 12, 16,\n22 and 28 points.\nNumbering and lettering systems can be combined with\ntypographic cueing of headings. Headings set in different type\nversions aid comprehension of the material. We can use a spe-\ncial typeface for headings, for example a sans serif typeface like\nAvant Garde, Futura, Gill, or Helvetica.\nHeadings set in different type versions aid comprehension\nof the text content (Jonassen, 1982; Mayer, 1993). However,\nsuch a mix appears strange to some European readers. In Eu-\nrope there are national differences concerning the use of type-\nfaces with and without serifs. Scandinavian newspapers, for ex-\n166 ample, often use Modern Style typefaces, whereas England and\nFrance prefer Transitional Style or Old Style typefaces. In Ger-\nmany they have serif as well as sans-serif typefaces.\nPlacement of headings\nThe use of space and the actual placement of a heading can be\nused to enhance the hierarchic structure (Jonassen, 1982).\nHeadings shall be placed above and close to the following text.\nThis distance shall be smaller than the distance to the previous\nparagraph (Pettersson, 1993; Lipton, 2007). Sometimes head-\nings are indented.\nWe need to provide space enough for the headings in a text.\nThe amount of white space surrounding headings should cor-\nrespond to the heading hierarchy. A major heading needs to\nhave more space than a minor heading.\nThe distance between the heading and the text below the\nheading should always be smaller than the distance between the\nheading and the previous text (the text above). The heading \u201cbe-\nlongs with its own text\u201d. See the two examples on the next page.\nIn each case the total space for the heading is the same but the\npositions of the headings are different. Distinguishing headings\nwith extra white space makes a document easier to search and\neasier to read. See the two examples on next page.\n167 Example 1 Example 2\nA major heading needs to A major heading needs to\nhave more space than a mi- have more space than a mi-\nnor heading We need to pro- nor heading We need to pro-\nvide space enough for the vide space enough for the\nheadings in a text. headings in a text.\nBad placement\nGood placement\nThe distance between the The distance between the\nheading and the text below heading and the text below\nthe heading should always be the heading should always be\nsmaller than the distance smaller than the distance\nParagraphs\nThere are a few possibilities to emphasize paragraphs. Para-\ngraphs may be indented and/or separated with extra space for\nemphasis.\nParagraph indents\nAn indent is the distance between the lines in a text and the\ntext-face, usually the right part of the left margin. Paragraphs\nmay be indented and/or separated with extra space. First line\nindents are the distance between the beginning of the first line\nin a paragraph and the left margin. They are often used for the\nrunning text in books. There are also negative indents, hanging\nindents, nested indents and full paragraph indents. It is con-\nsidered to be bad typography to allow an indent on the bottom\nline of a page. To avoid this it might be possible to edit the text\nuntil it fits.\n168 First line indents\nIn order to emphasize the beginning of paragraphs in running\ntext the first lines may be indented and start with empty spaces.\nThe width of an em dash is commonly used for paragraph in-\ndentation. This width is equal to the height of the type. So in 12\npoint Georgia an em dash is 12 points wide. However, other\nwidths are also common. The fragment below demonstrates a\nfirst line indent, here marked with a blue rectangle.\nThe width of the first line indent in this paragraph is\nmarked with a blue rectangle. In this book first line indents are\nused in all paragraphs, with the exception of paragraphs follow-\ning headers and certain citations. Headings may be indented.\nAccording to Tinker (1963) indenting of the first sentence of\neach paragraph improves legibility by 7% for both single and\ndouble line spacing. According to Frase and Schwartz (1970)\nindenting the first sentence of each paragraph improves com-\nprehension of printed materials. Indenting of every sentence\nwill, however, slow down the reading speed.\nNegative indents\nThe indent on the first line of a paragraph may also be directed\nback into the left margin (or sometimes even forwarded into the\nright margin). This is called a negative indent and may be used\nfor reference lists, numbered lists and lists with bullets, and\nother characters like stars, squares etcetera. The fragment be-\nlow of a paragraph demonstrates a first line indent.\nThe first line in this paragraph starts in the left margin. This is an\nexample of a negative indent, here marked with an \u201cempty\u201d\nspace. The following lines will align with the margin. Headings\nmay have negative indents.\n169 Negative indents may also be used in texts where it is very\nimportant to draw attention to each new paragraph. However,\nas noted above, indenting of every sentence will slow down the\nreading speed.\nHanging indents\nHanging indents, or outdentions, are often used in reference\nlists, numbered lists and lists with bullets, and other characters\nlike stars, squares etcetera. All lines, except the first lines, begin\nwith an empty space. In contrast to texts with negative indents\nall the texts always remain within the text column. Indents\nmake it easy to find single references.\nThe fragment below of a \u201dreference list\u201d demonstrates\nhanging indents, here marked with blue rectangles.\nPettersson, R. (1989). Visuals for Information: Research and\nPractice. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Educational Technology\nPublications.\nPettersson, R. (1993). Visual Information. Englewood Cliffs,\nNJ: Educational Technology Publications.\nPettersson, R. (2002). Information Design, An introduction.\nAmsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Com-\npany.\n170 Nested indents\nNested indents are a form of indention in which each subse-\nquent indent is set relative to the previous indent, and not rela-\ntive to a margin. Nested indents may be used to graphically\nshow the relationship between chapters, sections, sub-sections\nand paragraphs within a text. Tables of contents often have\nnested indents to show each successive level.\nThe fragment below of a \u201dtables of contents\u201d demonstrates\nnested indents, here marked with blue rectangles.\nChapter A\nSection 1\nSub-section 1A\nSub-section 1B\nSub-section 1C\nSection 2\nSection 3\nChapter B\nChapter C\nFull paragraph indents\nLong quotations should be distinctly separated from the rest of\nthe text. Quotations are often indented, sometimes also on the\nright side. Full paragraph indents may also be used for lists and\ntables. See the section Quotations.\nExtra space\nReaders prefer small text paragraphs to big ones. Often it is\nquite easy to divide the text in hierarchic and natural parts, por-\ntions, or sections. Natural breaks emphasized by typography are\nhelpful. Providing \u201cextra white space\u201d between paragraphs and\n171 between larger portions of the text provides valuable cues to the\nlearners that a new section or a new type of activity follows\n(Waller, 1987). The extra space between paragraphs may vary,\ndepending on the material.\nMarks\nThe end of a sentence should be determined by syntax rather\nthan by a set width of a line (Hartley, 1980; Bork, 1982). There\nare usually no problems with continuation of text in books. The\ntext fills up page after page, and chapter after chapter. However,\nin magazines and other periodical publications, it is sometimes\nnecessary to use special continuation marks. These marks may\nbe arrows or triangles and references to page numbers. In these\nsituations it might also be a good idea to use terminal marks\nafter the last paragraph in the article. Such a mark is often a\ncircle or a square, filled or unfilled. Sometimes the terminal\nmark is the initials or the signature of the writer.\nTables\nNumeric data can be used to illustrate several different situa-\ntions, such as chronological changes in single quantities or sets\nof quantities, parts of a whole, and relationships between two or\nmore variables.\nThere are different ways to present numeric data. In print\nmedia numeric data can be presented in text, as figures and dig-\nits, in tables, or in various graphical formats. No more than one\nor two items of numeric data should be presented in prose form.\nTables are often, but not always, a good solution. Tables may\nshow the maximum of amount of information in the minimum\namount of space.\n172 Many people find tables confusing and difficult to under-\nstand (Wright, 1968). Tables should be structured and compact\nfor easy accessibility. Sometimes a diagram or a graph may be a\nbetter choice.\nVertically oriented tables\nThe following three examples, Table 1, 2 and 3, demonstrate\nhow vertically oriented tables may look. In these examples the\ndata that are used has no interest at all. Table-titles are often,\nbut not always, put above the actual table. They include descrip-\ntions of the table contents. However, in these examples the\ntable-titles only comment on the design of the table below.\nTable 1. This is a vertically oriented table. Ruling in the table is\nthin.\nSales in $\nProducts\n2012 2013 2014\nProduct 1 100 120 110\nProduct 2 200 180 210\nProduct 3 200 220 210\nProduct 4 300 320 350\nProduct 5 400 420 410\n173 Table 2. This is a vertically oriented table without ruling.\nSales in $\nProducts\n2012 2013 2014\nProduct 1 100 120 110\nProduct 2 200 180 210\nProduct 3 200 220 210\nProduct 4 300 320 350\nProduct 5 400 420 410\nTable 3. This is another vertically oriented table without any\nruling. However, in this case the columns are very wide. The\nlarge distance between the numerical data in the columns\nmakes it hard to read the table below.\nSales in $\nProducts\n2012 2013 2014\nProduct 1 100 120 110\nProduct 2 200 180 210\nProduct 3 200 220 210\nProduct 4 300 320 350\nProduct 5 400 420 410\nReaders prefer vertically oriented tables rather than hori-\nzontally oriented tables. In vertically oriented tables it is easy to\nsee the target entries, and then quickly find the data in the table\ncells to the right (Wright, 1968; Wright and Fox, 1972; Ehren-\nberg, 1977). It is easy for us to compare data \u201cside by side.\u201d\n174 Horizontally oriented tables\nThe following three examples, Table 4, 5 and 6, demonstrate\nhow horizontally oriented tables may look. As in the previous\nexamples of tables the data has no interest at all and the table-\ntitles only comment on the design of the tables.\nTable 4. This is a horizontally oriented table. Ruling in the\ntable is thin.\nProducts\nSales in $\nProduct 1 Product 2 Product 3 Product 4 Product 5\n2012 100 200 200 300 400\n2013 120 180 220 320 420\n2014 110 210 210 340 410\nTable 5. This is a horizontally oriented table without ruling.\nProducts\nSales in $\nProduct 1 Product 2 Product 3 Product 4 Product 5\n2012 100 200 200 300 400\n2013 120 180 220 320 420\n2014 110 210 210 340 410\n175 Table 6. This horizontally oriented table is not only very ugly,\nit is also very confusing and provides very poor legibility.\nPlease note that all the data are the same as in previous tables.\nProducts\nSales\nin $ Product Product\nProduct 1 Product 2 Product 4\n3 5\n100\n2012 200 200 300 400\n2013\n120 180 220 320 420\n2014 110 210 210 340 410\nHorizontally oriented tables are harder to use and more dif-\nficult to understand than vertically oriented tables (Wright,\n1968; Wright and Fox, 1972). It is complicated to compare data\n\u201cup and down.\u201d\nGood tables\nTables that communicate the quantitative aspects of data are\neffective only when the data are arranged so that their meaning\nis obvious at a glance (Ehrenberg, 1977). After deciding what\ndata to present but before design a table, we need to consider\nthat (a) rounded-off values may display patterns and exceptions\nmore clearly than precise values, (b) a reader can compare\nnumbers down a column more easily than across a row, and (c)\ncolumn and row averages can provide a visual focus that allows\nthe reader to inspect the data easily.\nAccording to Tinker (1963) the type used in tables should\nbe no smaller than 8-point, and no larger than 12-point (Tinker,\n1963; Wright and Fox, 1972, p. 241). Like pictures, all tables\n176 should be integrated with the text content, in the flow of text. In\na text, tables should preferably be put between paragraphs, and\nnot forced to break paragraphs and thus disturb the reading.\nSans-serif typefaces are usually used in tables. Good examples\nare Helvetica and Franklin.\nIn friendly graphs (Tufte, 1983; 1990), words are spelled\nout, they run from left to right (in western societies), and data\nare explained. Elaborately encoded shadings, cross-hatching,\nand colours are avoided. Colours are easy to distinguish, type is\nclear and precise, and is done in upper and lower case with ser-\nifs. In unfriendly graphs, abbreviations abound, words run in\nmany directions. Graphics are repellent and cryptic with ob-\nscure coding. The design is insensitive to colour-deficient view-\ners Red and green are used for essential contrasts, and type is\nclotted and in all capitals in sans serif.\nWright and Fox (1972) offer the following guidelines for the\nconstruction of tables for the general public and non-\nprofessional audiences (p. 241):\n\u2022 All the information the learner will need should be pre-\nsented in the table. That is, the learner should not be re-\nquired to interpolate, combine entries, draw inferences, or\notherwise manipulate the contents of the table in order to\ndetermine the correct answer. Rather, the learner should\nonly be required to scan the list to find the correct target en-\ntry.\n\u2022 Type size used in the table should be between 8 and 12 point.\n\u2022 Items should be arranged vertically in the table rather than\nhorizontally (i.e., the list of target entries should be vertical).\n\u2022 Items within columns should be grouped and separated\nfrom other groups by either white space or rules (lines) in\n177 order to facilitate reading without accidentally moving to\nanother row. Groups should contain no more than five\nitems.\n\u2022 Redundant abbreviations of units should not be included\nwithin the table entries [although they should be included in\nthe column or row headings].\n\u2022 \u2018Landmarks\u2019 or sub-headings \u2013 certain target entries in the\ntable highlighted by using bold type or a larger font (e.g.,\nevery tenth entry, starting with 10, 20, 30, etc.) as an in-\ntended aid to locating entries \u2013 should not be used, since\nthey appear to be ineffective and possibly confusing.\n\u2022 It is useful to have adjacent columns printed in different\nfonts or styles to distinguish between them. That is, there is\nless chance of erroneous reading of the table if the column of\ntarget entries is in normal text (for example) and the column\nof associated answers is in boldface text.\n\u2022 Related pairs of items in adjacent columns should be spaced\nclosely together (i.e., the eyes should not have to traverse a\ngreat distance between the target entry and the associated\nanswer).\n\u2022 Whenever possible, columns should be arranged so that the\ntarget entries are to the left of the answers.\nEhrenberg (1977) provides some more general guidelines for the\nconstruction of tables for the general public and non-\nprofessional audiences:\n\u2022 Numbers should be rounded off to no more than two signifi-\ncant figures to facilitate learners\u2019 making comparisons.\n\u2022 Averages of rows and columns (as appropriate) should be\ngiven to facilitate learners\u2019 making comparisons of individ-\nual cell entries to them.\n178 \u2022 Put the most important comparisons into columns (rather\nthan rows), as columns make for the easiest comparisons.\n\u2022 Numbers in rows or columns should be arranged in some\nmeaningful order whenever possible (e.g., increasing or de-\ncreasing).\nBigwood and Spore (2003, 2013) discussed how to present\ncharts, numbers, and tables for easy communication. They pro-\nvided the following six rules of plain figures:\n\u2022 Put figures in a logical order, often from the largest to the\nsmallest.\n\u2022 Add focus to figures. Arithmetic means and medians make it\neasier to see exceptions and patterns in the data. Percen-\ntages show proportions. Totals provide overviews.\n\u2022 Keep numbers to be compared close. This proximity aids\ncomparisons.\n\u2022 Round figures for clarity. In many situations exact numbers,\nwith four decimals, does not matter. It may often be a good\nidea to use variable rounding and convert exact numbers to\ntwo, or three, effective digits, regardless of the size of the\nnumber.\n\u2022 Provide written summaries in the text of the charts, num-\nbers, and tables.\n\u2022 Use layout to guide the eye, and avoid distracting and un-\nnecessary decorative elements that interfere with the con-\ntent in graphs.\n179 Table 7. This vertically oriented table provides good legibility.\nHowever, sometimes more lines are needed.\nSales in $\nProducts\n2013 2014\nProduct 1 100 120\nProduct 2 200 180\nProduct 3 200 220\nProduct 4 300 320\nProduct 5 400 420\nThere are obviously many ways to design even a simple\ntable. It is easy to agree with the Publication Manual of the\nAmerican Psychological Association (1996, 121) where the\nAmerican Psychological Association concludes \u201cthat an author\u2019s\nthoughtful preparation makes the difference between a table\nthat confuses and one that informs the reader.\u201d\nCaptions\nMost pictures are capable of several interpretations until an-\nchored to one by a caption (Barthes, 1977). McDougall and\nHampton (1990, p. ix) concluded that photographs nearly al-\nways need a partnership with words that will confirm, clarify\nand reinforce their messages.\nPlacement of caption\nEach picture should have its own caption, unless two pictures or\na series of pictures are closely together. A caption may be placed\nin many ways. The caption should always be located close to the\n180 picture. Readers usually expect to find the captions beneath the\npictures. However, captions can also be placed above, to the left,\nor to the right, of the picture, but never inside the picture frame.\nUse flushed right text if you want to put the caption to the left of\nthe picture. Use flushed left text if you want to put the caption\nto the right of the picture. When the caption is put above or be-\nneath the picture, we can use justified text or flushed left text\nand sometimes even centred text. Sometimes triangles or\narrows pointing from the caption towards the picture are used,\nespecially when pictures are gathered together many on a page,\ne.g., in a magazine.\nPlacing the caption inside the picture makes it harder for\npeople to read the picture as well as the text. Nor should the\ncaption be located on some other page, as happens far too often\nin reference books and textbooks used in schools.\nHere are different ways to place captions. Readers usually ex-\npect to find captions beneath the picture as in the first example\nto the left.\nTypography of caption\nThe caption should have a different typographic size or even a\ndifferent typeface so it can be easily distinguished from the\nmain text. The captions should not be in negative form in a col-\nour picture since the slightest misalignment in printing makes\n181 the captions extremely difficult to read. Never make the caption\ntype larger than the main text. The title of the caption could be\nprinted in boldface.\n(See the book Information Design 2\u2013Text Design for fur-\nther information about captions.)\nQuotations\nSometimes quotations are included in a text. Short quotations\ncan be integrated into the body text, but long quotations should\nbe distinctly separated from the rest of the text. Quotations are\noften indented, sometimes also on the right side. Any quotation\nthat is used must have the source of reference cited, in keeping\nwith common rules of writing. Below is an example of a short\ntext segment (blue) with an embedded quotation (here green).\nThe full paragraph indent is shown with a blue rectangle.\nOn occasion, unfortunately, communication does not seem\nto function. This may depend on insufficient information, but it\nmay also be because we have difficulty reaching each other. By\nway of example, the following text is cited as a warning in The\nTechnical Writer's Handbook by Young (1989, p. 206):\nConditional symbolic modified single-digit arithmetic using\noptical content-addressable memory logic elements: Condi-\ntional symbolic modified signed-digit arithmetic operators.\nEsoteric and impenetrable jargon like this can be perceived as\nincomprehensible by the uninitiated. Since readers who do not\nknow the code are left out, its use poses the risk of \u2018one-way-\nonly\u2019 communication, and has no value outside of initiated\ncircles.\n182 In this example, the body text and the quotation are set with 12\npoint Georgia with 16 point line spacing. Quite often the quota-\ntion is set in a smaller type. Between the text and the quotation,\nthere are spaces that each corresponds to half a line, in this case\neight points. Blank space (blank lines) like these can be used in\nvarious contexts to provide space above and below, for example,\npictures, tables, and lists. In fact, we may use \u201cempty lines\u201d for\nvertical separation of text elements rather than printed lines of\nany kind. In this book the firsts paragraphs below quotations\nand examples are not indented.\nLists\nPutting information into list form can facilitate comprehension\n(Hartley, 1987; Frase and Schwartz, 1970). There are several\ntypes of lists used in technical documentation. A book, for ex-\nample, usually contains a table of contents, a subject index, and\na bibliography. It may even contain lists of pictures and tables,\nor of authors or other persons. The text in the book may have\nvarious lists of characteristics, criteria, requirements, or pros-\npects. Within a body text, there may be various lists of charac-\nteristics, criteria, items, requirements, persons, and products.\nBullets and numbers are used for items of the first degree. Hy-\nphens are used for lists within such a list. In a numbered list,\nthe various items are ordered according to their importance,\nunlike the unnumbered list. In an unnumbered list items may\nbe ordered alphabetically, or not at all. It is also possible to use\nupper case letters or upper case roman figures for items of the\nfirst degree, numbers in Arabic figures for the second degree,\nbullets for the third degree, and hyphens for the fourth degree.\n183 Table of contents\nThe table of contents may have justified or unjustified text. The\nimportant thing is that the structure of the content in the\ndocument is clearly visible to the reader.\nThe table of contents immediately follows heading level\none, (\u201cContents\u201d) and may be set in 12 point normal type with\n14 point line spacing, left-aligned, and without any extra space\nbefore each entry. Chapter designations may be set in bold face,\nwhile section designations usually are set in normal typeface.\nPage-numbers follow each text on the same line. They may also\nbe flushed right.\nWhen a table of contents is extensive, it may be rendered in\ntwo columns. References to page numbers are often shown for\nheading levels one, two and three, with indents for each succes-\nsive level. Heading levels four and more are usually not shown\nin a table of contents. This would impair the possibility to get an\noverview and understanding of the overall structure.\nBibliographies\nReferences to cited works are usually put in a reference list at\nthe end of a chapter or at the end of a book. When each chapter\nhas its own bibliography, the heading \u201cBibliography\u201d or \u201cRefer-\nences\u201d may be set as a heading 2 in the document. When there\nis only one bibliography for a factual study book, heading level 1\nis used.\nBibliographies are often voluminous and may take up a\ngreat deal of space. Since the reader will usually peruse such a\nlist to find only certain entries, they should be made easy to\nfind. Therefore, the text should be distinct even though it is\nrelatively compact. One common bibliography may be a good\n184 idea when several references are the same in more than one\nchapter.\nIn a printed book bibliographies may be set in ten point\ntype with 11 point line spacing, with 12 point negative indents.\nAbove them, there may be 2 or 3 points of space, but no extra\nspace is needed below. Indents make it easy to find single refer-\nences.\nA bibliography may be laid out to cover the full width of the\ncolumn. If the bibliography is very extensive we should divide it\ninto two columns that are equal in size, even if the body of the\ntext in the document is arranged in one wide column.\nThe subject index\nA well-constructed subject index, \u201cIndex,\u201d is often an indispen-\nsable tool for quickly finding information in books. As is the\ncase with bibliographies, the readers are usually looking only for\ncertain information when they refer to a list of this kind.\nA subject index may be set in three 50-millimetres-wide\ncolumns, in ten point type on 11 point lines, with 12 point in-\ndents. It is not necessary to have extra space between the lines.\nHowever, there may be a half a line of space between groups of\nwords that begin with successive letters of the alphabet. The\ntitle of the subject index may be set as a header 1.\nLists of items\nWithin a body text, there may be various lists of characteristics,\ncriteria, items, requirements, persons, and products. Bullets\nand numbers are used for items of the first degree. Hyphens are\nused for lists within such a list. In a numbered list, the various\nitems are ordered according to their importance, unlike the un-\nnumbered list. In an unnumbered list items may be ordered\nalphabetically, or not at all. It is also possible to use upper case\n185 letters or upper case roman figures for items of the first degree,\nnumbers in Arabic figures for the second degree, bullets for the\nthird degree, and hyphens for the fourth degree.\nNotes\nNotes tend to fray the reading fabric. If notes are required, they\nmay be collected in a numbered list at the end of each chapter\nimmediately before the bibliography, and arranged like a list of\nitems with numbers instead of characters to mark them. Occa-\nsional notes and brief references may be placed as footnotes at\nthe bottom of the page, or sometimes in the left or right margin\nor at the end of the chapter or article. Usually a smaller type size\nor a different typeface is used for footnotes. A horizontal line\ncan separate the footnotes from the running text. When there\nare two or more columns on a page footnotes should be placed\nat the end of the document\nThe title pages\nA book begins with a title page with the title of the book, the\nname(s) of the writer(s), and the name of the publisher. On the\nsecond page, the imprint page, administrative information such\nas the name of the document, a document number, a security\nclassification, revision or version number, and date of publica-\ntion may be provided at the top of the page. Information about\nthe ISBN- or the ISSN-number and the copyright holder are\nusually provided at the bottom of the imprint page. There are\nusually no pagination on the title and imprint pages.\nOn the third page in a book, there is the preface. The\nheader \u201cPreface\u201d may be set as heading one. A preface will usu-\nally not exceed two pages. Page three is usually the first page\nwith pagination. On the fifth page, or the first odd page after\npage five, the table of contents starts. The header \u201cContents\u201d\n186 may be set as header one. However, in e-books intended for\nreading on screens the table of contents may start on page four.\nThe pages with preface and table of contents are often pagi-\nnated with lower-case roman figures. The book is numbered\nwith Arabic figures.\nMiscellaneous\nThis section contains short notes on a limited number of items\nin graphic design.\nAbstract, a short summary of a paper put in the beginning, be-\nlow the author lines and above the body text.\nAchromatic colours are black and white.\nActive space or positive space in a visual is the part represent-\ning different objects. Space has no meaning in itself, but it may\nbe used to separate or bring together different picture elements.\nAgate lines are vertical measurement of space, there are four-\nteen agate lines to an inch.\nArtistic layout may please the individual artistic graphic de-\nsigner, but may have no relation to the content of the message.\nAscender. The part of a lower case letter (b, d, f, h, k, l) that as-\ncend above its x-height. These letters may be taller than the cap\nheight.\nAuthor lines are the lines at the beginning of a paper with the\nname of the author or the authors. It is often centred and set in\nsmaller type than the heading.\n187 Balance is the sum of all the elements, the verticals and hori-\nzontals, the darks and lights, that make up the design.\nBleed is text and/or pictures that extend beyond the trim edge\nof the printed page.\nBlowup is an enlarged picture.\nBold type, or boldface, members of a family of type in which\nletters are heavy, bold.\nBorders are ornamental rules around the edge of a page or a\npage component.\nBoxes.\nSpecially important messages like summaries can be boxed-in\nto gain special attention. If the lines are shorter the effect is\neven more obvious. Boxes usually have thin lines. Boxes may\nsometimes be filled with a background colour.\nBullets (\u2022) are commonly used in lists of items in \u201cpoint form\u201d\nwithout numbers. Bullets are more powerful than hyphens (-) or\nasterisks (*).\nCamera-ready is a final printout of a page with text and pic-\ntures that is ready for reproduction, and also or art that is ready\nfor reproduction.\nCap height or H-height. The size of capital letters in a typeface,\nexpressed as a percentage of the point size. (See illustration in\nchapter 2.)\nCapital letters, caps, are harder to read than a combination of\nupper and lower case letters.\n188 Caps is short for capital letters.\nCheck box. Check boxes (\uf0a3) can be used in instructional ma-\nterials when learners may make check marks when they have\nfinished assignments.\nChop-mark is the symbol of a printer specializing in printing of\nfine arts, such as etchings, etc.\nChromatic colours are blue, green, red and yellow.\nColour-key is a process for obtaining process colours on film by\nexposure to light.\nColour-spacing. Positioning letters so that balances of negative\nand positive spaces are pleasing.\nColumn is a vertical segment of a printed page.\nColumn rules are vertical lines between two columns.\nCondensed. Horizontally narrow type designs.\nContinuous-tone is a complete range of gray, from black to\nwhite.\nContrast is the result from differences along a common visual\ndimension that can be observed between various elements in a\ndesign.\nCopy is usually the text in a design, but also all the elements of a\nfinished design.\nCredits. In books it is quite common to give credits to artists\nand photographers in a special \u201cList of illustrations\u201d. In maga-\nzines and in newspapers credits are usually put next to the ac-\n189 tual illustration, often in a vertical position. Credits to the\nauthor are usually in the form of a byline.\nCutoff rules are horizontal lines that separate unrelated items\nabove and below the line.\nCyan, the particular blue used in four colour process printing.\nDash. With the typewriters we had to create a dash (\u2014) with two\nhyphens (--). With desktop publishing and typography this is\nnot necessary. In 12 point Georgia the em dash is 12 points\nwide. In desktop publishing we can create the em dash or em\nrule (\u2014), the en dash or en rule (\u2013), as well as the hyphen (-).\nThe em dash is used to indicate a break in thought. There\nshould be no space before or after the em dash. The en dash is\nused between numerals (e.g., pp. 33\u201345 and as a minus sign\n(e.g., \u201312).\nDescender is the part of some lower case letters (g, j, p, q, y)\nthat descend below the baseline.\nDidot system, a system for measuring size in typography, 12\npoints = 4.511 mm.\nDifferentiation. It is essential to be able to differentiate ele-\nments from one another.\nDisinformation is the opposite of information design.\nDot. A dot is a full stop (.) to mark the end of a complete sen-\ntence.\nDrop caps are lowered initial letters.\nDropout is a halftone in which no dots fall on white areas.\n190 Dust cover or jacket is the paper wrapper of a hardbound book.\nEllipsis. An ellipsis (...) is normally used to indicate that a part\nof a text is missing in a quotation.\nEm is the square of the body of type. See Dash.\nExtended. Horizontally wide type designs.\nFace is the printing surface of type; also, any particular style of\ntype.\nFill-in blanks. Fill-in blanks (_) can be used in assignments,\nand in lists of various kinds, for people to mark their choices.\nFolder. A folder consists of a single sheet, usually printed on\nboth sides, and folded two or more times.\nFont of type is a complete assortment of characters of the same\nstyle and size. However, in computer manuals the word font is\nsometimes used to mean typeface, which is confusing.\nFooters. When present, footers appear at the bottom of every\npage. Like headers, footers may carry page numbers.\nFormal balance has total symmetry and it is felt to be static and\nharmonious. It may, however, also be boring. Composition can\nbe used to direct the viewers.\nGlossy is a reproduction proof of type.\nGraphical media include products such as almanacs, cata-\nlogues, children\u2019s books, dictionaries, educational materials,\nencyclopaedias, forms, graphic symbols, handbooks, indexes,\nmaintenance information, manuals, maps, non-fiction books,\n191 plans, product descriptions, reference books, reports, textbooks,\nand tickets.\nGraphics editors work on schematic pictures that are delivered\nby subject matter experts and writers. They produce finished\nschematic pictures.\nGrid, a geometric pattern used as a base for layout.\nGrouping. By grouping headings, paragraphs, illustrations, and\ncaptions, the designer aids communication.\nGutter. The margin at the binding edge of a page, or inside edge\nof unbound pages.\nH-height, or cap height, is the size of capital letters in a type-\nface, expressed as a percentage of the point size.\nHairline. A hairline is the finest line in metal type. Hairlines are\noften used to divide columns.\nHalftone. A halftone is a reproduction in which tones have been\nphotographed through a screen. The picture is divided into dots.\nSize of dots governs darks and lights.\nHanging indent, or outdentation, is the reverse of indentation.\nExamples are lists with bullets.\nHarmony describes the effect of the pleasing interaction of all\nthe design elements in a design.\nHeaders. When present headers, or running heads, appear at\nthe top of every page. Like footers, headers may also carry page\nnumbers.\n192 Hot type, hot lead typesetting, hot metal typesetting, mechani-\ncal typesetting, metal type, refers to 19th-century technologies\nfor typesetting text. Hot melted type metal is injected into\nmoulds. The resulted characters are used for printing ink onto\npaper.\nInterest. Scale, contrast, and colour may add visual interest to a\ndesign.\nInterline distance is the vertical distance from one baseline to\nanother baseline in a text.\nIntroductions to chapters in a book or to articles in a magazine\nor a newspaper are very often set in different type than the fol-\nlowing running text. Sometimes the introduction is set with lar-\nger type size, sometimes in italic or bold typefaces.\nItalic type, italic, or italics, are members of a family of type in\nwhich letters slant to the right. Italics are designed to comple-\nment the normal vertical design. See the section Stylistic vari-\nation of type.\nJacket or dust cover is the paper wrapper of a hardbound book.\nJim dashes are short cut-off rules that separate unrelated items\nabove and below the line.\nKern (verb) manually adjusting the space between characters to\nachieve better legibility, (noun) the amount of space added or\nsubtracted in the process. See the section Spacing.\nLeading, spacing between lines in a text. See the section Inter-\nline distance.\nLetterform is the design of individual characters of a typeface.\n193 Letterhead is the top of a designed writing paper.\nLetterspace (verb) to add extra space between letters; (noun)\nthe amount of extra space added.\nLigatures. Ligatures are letters combined to new characters.\nExamples are \u00c6 (A+E) and \u0152 (O+E).\nLine length is the horizontal measure of a line.\nLine space is the vertical distance from one baseline to another\nbaseline. See the section Interline distance.\nLines. Various lines are often used for decoration to make a\nmore aesthetically pleasing or artistic product. However, lines\ncan also be used to aid communication.\nHorizontal lines can separate sections or paragraphs or hold\nthem together. Horizontal black lines are usually one to four\npoints. When horizontal lines are printed in other colours they\nmay be wider.\nWhen two or more columns are used on a page, vertical lines\ncan be used to clearly separate the text blocks from one another.\nBy tradition vertical lines are thin, usually half a point or one\npoint.\nLinotype is a machine for setting hot type line by line.\nLithography is a printing process based on the fact that oil and\nwater don\u2019t mix.\nLower case is the un-capitalized \u201csmall\u201d letters of the alphabet\n(a, b, c etcetera).\n194 Magenta is the particular red used in process printing with four\ncolours.\nMargins are the areas surrounding the text and pictures on a\nprinted page. See the section Text layout.\nModern type is a typeface with thin, flat serifs. See the section\nTypefaces.\nMoir\u00e9 is an undesirable pattern in a picture that occurs by re-\nscreening halftone copy.\nMonotype is a machine for setting hot type letter by letter.\nNegative space is the space between and around pictures, and\nalso between the elements within a picture.\nOblique is an \u201cartificial italic.\u201d It is formed by electronically\nslanting a vertical typeface. Italics, however, are specially de-\nsigned.\nOffset is a kind of lithographic printing in which ink is trans-\nferred to a rubber blanket, then to the paper.\nOpen ended boxes are boxes with rules only at the top and bot-\ntom.\nOrnaments. Various ornaments and patterns can be used to\nseparate different sections in a text. In instructional materials\nthey are often used to mark specific activities. They can also be\nused for decoration, to make a more aesthetically pleasing or\nartistic product. Dingbats is a special PostScript font in desktop\npublishing systems\nOutdentation, or hanging indent, is the reverse of indentation.\nExamples are lists with bullets.\n195 Point, is used for measurement of letter size, see the section Size\nof type.\nPointers are lines combining labels with elements in a picture.\nPrimary colours, red, yellow, and blue; all others can be mixed\nfrom these.\nProcess colours are magenta, cyan, yellow and black. These are\nthe inks used in four-colour process printing.\nQuotation marks, \u2018 \u2019 \u201c \u201d \u00ab \u00bb, are used according to the different\nstandards in different languages.\nRough is a preliminary layout.\nRules are vertical and horizontal straight lines used in typogra-\nphy and layout.\nRun-arounds. When text is \u201cwrapped\u201d around an irregularly\nshaped illustration this is known as a \u201crun-around.\u201d Run-\narounds almost never represent any improvements and should\nbe avoided.\nSans serif is a typeface without serifs.\nScale describes the relative size or magnitude of a given design\nelement in relation to other elements and to the design as a\nwhole.\nSeparation. Use of separation devices such as bullets, numbers,\nand letters facilitate recall of information in list form.\nSerifs are the terminal strokes, normally at the top and bottom\nof the main strokes of letters in a Roman type style.\n196 Shaded letters have strong three-dimensional quality by use of\nheavy shadows on one side of main stroke.\nSmall caps or small capitals are an alternative set of capitals\nused for text setting. These SMALL CAPITALS are smaller than\nstandard CAPITALS.\nSpecial designs. Chemical, mathematical, astronomical, and\nmedical signs are important for use in these subject matters.\nSpreads are two facing pages in books, etc.\nSubscript is a character set lower than the body of text, like the\nfigure 2 in x . See Superscript.\n2\nSummaries. Important messages like summaries can be boxed-\nin to gain special attention. If the lines are shorter, the effect is\neven more obvious. Boxes usually have thin lines. Boxes may\nsometimes be filled with a background colour.\nSuperscript is a character set higher than the body of text, like\nthe figure 2 in x2. See Subscript.\nSymbols. Various symbols can be used to aid communication in\na book or a magazine. An example is a mark for continuation\n(>). Many ornaments may be used as symbols.\nTitle Case, each word begins with a capital letter, is sometimes\nused in titles and in figure texts.\nType. The term type refers to all characters that are used in\nprinting. See the section Typefaces.\nUpper case is a term for capital letters of the alphabet (A, B, C\netcetera).\n197 x-height is the vertical distance equal to the height of lowercase\nletters such as x (without ascenders and descenders).\nLayout of text and pictures\nA typical page in a telephone directory is almost filled with text.\nThere are no pictures, and margins are narrow. The text may\ncover 90 percent of the page. In dictionaries the text covers 75-\n80 percent, and in specialist books and factual study books the\ntext often covers 50-60 percent of the page. In pure literature\nand children\u2019s books, the text area is often even smaller than\nthat. When a picture covers the entire page, there is no space for\ntext or margins. The third extreme is an empty page.\nDifferent layouts\nA picture without a caption has no or almost no informational\nvalue. A picture is too ambiguous on its own. A picture caption\nmust describe the picture and guide the reader to the interpre-\ntation the informer wished to convey to the reader. Both words\nand pictures may possess an emotive force that is not easily\nforeseen. A number of different value judgments may slip into a\ntext when the purpose of the text is merely to supply informa-\ntion.\nThe reader\u2019s emotions may be aroused by seemingly insig-\nnificant details in a visual or nuances in the wording of a text.\nSo sufficient effort must be invested in the editing of both texts\nand pictures. Interest can be focused on the central message in\npictures through careful picture selection and editing, primarily\nby means of cropping, which is, deleting non-essential portions.\nSometimes different visuals benefit from being presented in a\ngroup. This may be the case for a photograph and an explana-\n198 tory drawing, or several photographs or drawings forming a\nmini-series or related picture sequence.\nWhen texts and visuals are collected for informative pages\nand spreads, \u201cmessage transmission\u201d must be a central con-\nsideration. As previously noted this kind of \u201cinformation layout\u201d\ndiffers from a \u201cdecoration layout\u201d in which purely aesthetic as-\npects are allowed to predominate.\nThe preparation and production of maps is called cartogra-\nphy. The product of a cartographer\u2019s efforts is a mathematically\ndefined depiction of a reality based on measurements. Maps\ndescribe reality and shed light on a number of conditions, such\nas terrain, political subdivisions, the prevalence of certain types\nof soil, minerals, etc. The utilization of variations in shape and\ncolour creates map symbols that provide a picture of the reality\nthey represent. A carefully processed map contains more infor-\nmation per square inch than any other form of printed informa-\ntion.\nIn newspaper layout many different messages have to be\ncommunicated. The problem is to communicate a series of dis-\nconnected messages of infinitely varying significance within a\nlimited space, time, and economy with a recognizably consistent\nstyle for each section of the paper. Many readers will only spend\ntime on a limited amount of information in a newspaper. It is\nknown that elements like headlines, photos, drawings, and in-\nformation graphics attract attention and often are entry points\ninto a page. Size and placement of such elements influence how\nthe reader will read a page. It is possible that many readers may\njump over too large pictures and never look at them at all. In\nmagazine layout visuals are often very large.\nQuite often the visuals have no or a very limited contact\nwith the text. Here White (1987) asks for less typographic\n199 amusement and more serious character building. Fiction layout\ncertainly does not work very well in instructional message de-\nsign. However, even in traditional non-fiction publishing, it is\noften very hard to access the information.\nPicture placement has very often been based on aesthetic\nrather than instructional characteristics. The appearance of\nelements on the page can provide powerful cues to the reader.\nThus, visuals should be located in close proximity to the parts of\nthe text in which pictured motifs are discussed. Visuals plus\ntheir captions should preferably be inserted into the text be-\ntween two paragraphs, not in the middle of a paragraph, so they\ndo not disrupt reading rhythm.\nCaptions and visuals are often piled up in different areas\nand sometimes even on different pages. Here, an effort should\nreally be made to achieve the best possible interplay of words\nand visuals. Visuals interact with the captions, other visuals,\nheadings, running text, tables, and maps on a page and on a\nspread in a book, a magazine, or a newspaper. The layout of the\nwhole spread should be attractive. However, the mere use of a\nlot of pictures is not at all enough. In an artistic layout, the mes-\nsage may actually be effectively hidden. The message is more\neffectively conveyed by an informative layout.\nThe basics for instructional message design could be sum-\nmarized in the following: Select Arrangement, Balance and Col-\nour to maximize Dynamism, Emphasis, Fidelity and Graphic\nHarmony.\nBalance in design\nIn nature balance is normal. A design should usually display\n\u201cgood balance\u201d. Elements of the design should fit together in an\naesthetic and harmonious relationship in a manner that is in-\n200 teresting but not distracting. Man has an intuitive sense of bal-\nance. When a single element is too large or too small, too light\nor too dark, too prominent or too indistinct, the entire design\nwill suffer from this imbalance. However, good balance is some-\nthing subjective. Different people may have quite different opin-\nions on any aesthetic issues.\nA composition is balanced when the visual weight of\ngraphical elements on either side of the centre of balance are\napproximately equal. As with a physical balance, lighter ele-\nments can balance heavier elements if their size or value is in-\ncreased, or if they are moved farther away from the centre of\nbalance. It is also possible to move the heavier elements closer\nto the centre of balance. Mullet and Sano (1995, 51) noted that\naltering even a single attribute of one part in a complex compo-\nsition could have a significant impact on the balance, the unity,\nand ultimately the harmony of the whole. When a single ele-\nment is too large or too small, too light or too dark, too promi-\nnent or indistinct, the entire design suffers.\nImbalance creates an uncomfortable feeling in the reader\nand should often be avoided. Imbalance, however, can be used\nto attract attention within a picture or within a material. Unex-\npected, irregular, and unstable design will attract attention. As\nsoon as instability is introduced in a design the result is a pro-\nvocative visual expression. The eye will struggle in order to ana-\nlyze the relationships and the balance within the picture.\nBalance can be formal with total symmetry or informal.\nFormal balance is felt to be static and harmonious. Informal\nbalance contributes to a feeling of dynamism. However, the\nmind needs stimulation and surprise. Contrast and imbalance\ncan dramatize a design and attract attention. Several artists use\n201 a visual strategy, such as combinations of dark and bright, large\nand small, round and square, to sharpen meaning.\nIf the lines used as pointers to elements in a picture are\nheavier than the lines in the picture itself this will create noise\nand clutter in the illustration. Pointers should be light in com-\nparison with the lines in a picture.\nImage placement\nPictures are frequent in most factual study books. A picture may\nbe placed on a page in many different ways. It is usually, but not\nnecessarily, adjusted to the width of the text column. A page\nwith more than one column has more possibilities for place-\nment of pictures. Usually, pictures are placed in a column of\ntext, and are centred. As a rule, they may be placed where they\nbest serve the presentation. Very small pictures can be placed in\nthe narrow column. On the other hand, wide pictures may cover\nthe entire text area of the page. Too many pictures will confuse\nthe layout and reduce the chances of the reader getting involved\nin the text. Too few pictures appear to increase the size of the\nbody text.\nA picture may expand beyond the width of the column and\ncover the margins and sometimes the whole page. \u201cBleed\u201d (cov-\nering the entire page, with no margins) may be used construc-\ntively and creative to expand the impact of important attention-\ngetting images. We should avoid too much text within the pic-\ntures. The text that is absolutely necessary (that is, key words)\nmay be set in nine point Helvetica with ten-point line spacing.\nSingle words that are especially important or have a compre-\nhensive function may be shown in bold face. In English texts,\nkey words usually begin with capital letters.\n202 A few examples of pages with text, pictures and their captions.\nAs previously noted many authors have noted that in ma-\nterials for information a picture should be located as close to the\nrelevant text passage as possible. It is usually a good idea to put\npictures between the appropriate paragraphs in the text to get\nmaximum impact (Pettersson, 1989, 1993). Pictures that are put\nwithin a paragraph will interfere with the reading of the text.\nAbove the picture, there should be at least one blank line, if, of\ncourse, the picture is not at the top of the page, in which case\nthe upper margin will provide sufficient empty space.\nA picture can be tilted on the page. Tilting of a picture may\ndraw special attention to it. Pictures on odd-numbered pages\nattract more attention than pictures on even pages. In news-\npapers and magazines it is quite often a correlation between\nplacement of pictures and perceived importance. The higher up\non a page a picture is placed, the more important it is con-\nsidered to be (White, 1987). Many visuals have a built in \u201cdirec-\ntion,\u201d e.g., a person on a photograph may be looking to the left.\nSuch a picture should usually be placed on the right page for the\nperson to look into the gutter and not out of the book or the\nmagazine.\nPeople who have not learned to read or write do not neces-\nsarily look at pictures in the order that has been intended by the\n203 designer. Therefore it often proves helpful, as messages are be-\ning tested, to ask several groups of people to arrange the indi-\nvidual message into a sequence that seems most logical to them\n(Zimmermann and Perkin, 1982; Wileman, 1993, p. 105). This\nis a way to better get to know the intended audience.\nImage framing\nA frame or box around an image, or sometimes around an il-\nlustration and text, may have different functions. Image fram-\ning can be functional and/or attentional. A frame will separate\nthe image from the surrounding context and draw special atten-\ntion to information within the frame. In a newspaper, framing is\na way of helping the readers to combine the corresponding text\nand pictures on the page.\nInterplay of visuals\nIn many situations it is a good idea to use more than one visual\nto be able to convey information. We can use image pairs or se-\nquences of images.\nImage pairs\nIn many situations it is a good idea to use pairs of visuals in\nwhich one is true-to-life, such as a photograph, and the other\nrepresents an analytical representation, such as a simple line\ndrawing. The analytical visual makes it easier for us to under-\nstand the content, and the realistic visual enables us to believe\nin the content. So the two visuals should be closely linked in a\ncarefully thought-out relationship. The actual size of two pic-\ntures may reflect a natural relationship of scale, but it may also\nreflect a relationship of importance.\n204 !\"#$%&'#()*\n!\"#$%\"&#'()*%)(+\"'#()#('#%#,++-#(-.%#)+#*'.#/%(0'#+1#2('*%3'#(\"#45(65#+\".#('#)0*.7\n)+73(1.8#'*65#%'#%#/5+)+,0%/58#%\"-#)5.#+)5.0#0./0.'.\")'#%\"#%\"%3&)(6%3#0./0.'.\"7\n)%)(+\"8#'*65#%'#%#'($/3.#3(\".#-0%4(\",9#:5.#%\"%3&)(6%3#2('*%3#$%;.'#()#.%'(.0#1+0\n*'#)+#*\"-.0')%\"-#)5.#6+\").\")8#%\"-#)5.#0.%3(')(6#2('*%3#.\"%<3.'#*'#)+#<.3(.2.#(\"\n)5.#6+\").\")9#=+#)5.#)4+#2('*%3'#'5+*3-#<.#63+'.3&#3(\";.-#(\"#%#6%0.1*33&#)5+*,5)7\n+*)#0.3%)(+\"'5(/9#\n! $ \" & %\n+,%&-.\"/(0#1(.0&.2&'(-13)%*&4&#05&6&(*&(*&3*3#778&/%11%)&1.&3*%&1,#0&1,%&-.\"/(0#1(.0&.2&\n'(-13)%*&9&#05&4:&+,%&#-13#7&*(;%&.2&1<.&'(-13)%*&=>&#05&?@&\"#8&)%27%-1&#&0#13)#7&)%7#A\n1(.0*,('&.2&*-#7%B&/31&(1&\"#8&#7*.&)%27%-1&#&)%7#1(.0*,('&.2&(\"'.)1#0-%:\n:+#.\"5%\"6.#6+$$*\"(6%)(+\"#()#('#2.0&#,++-#(1#)5.0.#('#%#3+,(6%3#0.3%)(+\"7\n'5(/#<.)4..\"#/(6)*0.'#/3%6.-#\".>)#)+#.%65#+)5.09#:5('#0.3%)(+\"'5(/#$%&#<.\n< %'.-#+\"#6+\"'(').\"6&#+0#+\"#6+\")(\"*()&9\nCS%eDv%0e1n%%t0e&e*3n/ Es%u-1b*&jDe(%c<ts%5 v&#i&e5w)#<ed(0 $a&. d2&1r<a.w&278in(0g$ &oFf. 3tw*%&oG f#l)y1(i0n*g:&+ H,%o&)u%-s.e)5 M%5&a2(HrA-\n#1(.0*&,#D%&/%%0&'7.11%5&.0&1,%&.317(0%*&1.&1,%&)($,1:&I(0%&*3/E%-1*&D(%<%5&1,%&D%)*(.0&\ntins.

However, sometimes it is necessary to divide a mes-\n!\"#\nsage content into a series of visuals. The amount of details can\nbe great or the content can include a certain period of time.\nTime scales and charts provide a reference in time and space. A\nsequence of pictures can be used to explain a development over\ntime. It can be used in instructions. A sequence of pictures tell-\ning parts of the same story can be used to hold a chapter to-\ngether to enhance the depth dimension in a printed material. A\nseries of pictures can approximate the impression of a motion\npicture sequence. Several consecutive enlargements of a specific\npart will help the reader to understand the detailed structure of\nan object.\n205 This example shows four ways of arranging a group of three\npictures with reference to (dotted) \u201clines of balance\u201d. (Captions\nare not visible in this example.)\nUnderstanding of a series of pictures is dependent upon the\nability to recognize that the object or person in each frame is the\nsame. For an exhibition, pictures and prints can be put on a wall\nor on a board in many different ways. Balance in the layout can\nbe achieved by putting all pictures on a joint base line or bottom\nedge. Balance can also be achieved by putting all pictures cen-\ntred on a \u201ccentral\u201d line. A third possibility is to put all the pic-\ntures on the wall with a joint upper edge. When we want to have\ntwo rows of pictures on the wall we can achieve balance with\nreference to a central line or cross or with reference to joint bot-\ntom and upper edges and joint side edges. A fourth possibility is\nto put all the pictures in a vertical sequence.\nThe picture area index\nEvans, Watson and Willows (1987) discussed the use of visuals\nin Canadian textbooks. They analyzed 11,236 textbook pages.\n8,304 pages had illustrations. Like Willows, Borwick and Hay-\nvren (1981) they used two different methods of measuring visu-\n206 als/pictures/illustrations. They calculated an \u201cindex of fre-\nquency,\u201d that is the number of pages with any visuals in percent\nof all pages (except title pages and indexes). The average index\nof frequency was 74% (8,304 pages with illustrations is 74% of\nall 11,236 pages). In lower grades almost all pages had illustra-\ntions (95-99%). For higher grades the index of frequency went\ndown considerably.\nIn textbooks, however, many pages have more than one pic-\nture. When visuals are used for information the \u201cactual number\nof illustrations\u201d seem to be much more important than the\nnumber of pages with illustrations. A \u201cpicture index,\u201d defined as\nthe average number of pictures for 100 pages, will no doubt be a\nbetter measure and more suited for international and inter-\ncultural comparisons of textbooks (Pettersson, 1990). It is pos-\nsible to calculate both the index of frequency and the picture\nindex from the data given by Evans et al. (1987) in their Appen-\ndices B and C. As seen from these data the index of frequency\nand the picture index really give complementary information\nabout the textbooks. It is easy to see how the character of these\ntextbooks changes from the lower to the higher grades within\neach group of subject matter.\nEvans, Watson and Willows (1987) also indexed the sizes of\nillustrations according to the percentage of the page occupied by\nthe illustrations. Illustrated pages were mentally divided into\nquarters and each illustration coded as occupying up to 25% of\nthe page, 26 to 50% of the page, 51 to 75% of the page, or more\nthan 75% of the page. For lower grades illustrations usually co-\nvered more than half of the page size. For higher grades the av-\nerage picture size usually decreased.\nMetallinos et al (1990) mentally divided the page into six\nequal parts, sixths, and indexed the sizes of illustrations in\n207 secondary school geography textbooks. The most common size\nwas 1/6 in Australia and Japan, and 2/6 in Greece, Sweden and\nthe US. They defined the \"average picture size\" as the average\npart of a page covered by pictures.\nIt is however not enough to get information about the sizes\nof the pictures. We can also use an index showing how the\navailable printed area in a book is divided between text and pic-\ntures. Thus the \"picture area index\" is defined as the average\npercentage of the text-face utilized for pictures. A book without\nany pictures will obviously have a picture area index of 0 (zero).\nWhen the index is 50 half of the total text-face in the book is\ncovered with pictures. A picture area index of 100 leaves no\nroom at all for any text in the book (except for texts printed in\nthe actual pictures).\nSome samples among textbooks for the 9\u2013year Swedish\ncomprehensive school showed that 60-80% of the text-face was\ncovered by illustrations in textbooks used for elementary level\n(year 1.3). For intermediate level (year 4\u20136) the percentage was\n50-70, and for senior level (year 6\u20139) it was 30-60, with a big\ndifference between various textbooks (Pettersson, 1991).\nToo be able to judge the quality of \"mental indexing\" of pic-\nture sizes and the possibility to use such data for calculations of\npicture area indexes the following study was done. One chapter\nin each of three textbooks were used and the picture area in-\ndexes were calculated with three different methods. (Melin and\nPettersson studied these three textbooks with respect to cap-\ntions, 1991).\nExact measurement\nFor each textbook the text-face was measured and calculated.\nThen all the pictures were measured. The heights and widths\n208 were measured in millimetres. The areas of the pictures were\ncalculated and added up to a total picture area. Then the picture\narea index was calculated. In the table below these results are\ncalled \"the real picture area index\".\nEstimation with quarters\nBased on the method used by Evans, Watson and Willows\n(1987) the text-faces (and not the pages) in each book were\nmentally divided into quarters and each illustration coded as\noccupying 0\u20131/4, 1/4\u20132/4, 2/4\u20133/4, and 3/4\u20134/4 of the text-\nface. (It is of course also easy to use a grid, drawn on a transpar-\nent foil.) Some pictures may actually be larger than the text-\nface. Such pictures are coded in the 3/4\u20134/4 category. The\nnumber of pictures within each category was multiplied by the\ntheoretical mean size for each group (that is 12.5%, 37.5%,\n62.5%, and 87.5% respectively). The added total picture area\nwas then divided by the total text-face resulting in an \"esti-\nmated picture area index\".\nEstimation with sixths\nBased on the method used by Metallinos et al (1990) the text-\nfaces (and not the pages) in each book were mentally divided\ninto sixths and each illustration coded as occupying 0\u20131/6, 1/6\u2013\n2/6, 2/6\u20133/6, 3/6\u20134/6, 4/6\u20135/6, and 5/6\u20136/6 of the text-face.\n(It is of course also easy to use a grid, drawn on a transparent\nfoil.) Some pictures may actually be larger than the text-face.\nSuch pictures are coded in the 5/6\u20136/6 category. The number\nof pictures within each category was multiplied by the theoreti-\ncal mean size for each group (that is 8.8%, 25.0%, 41.6%,\n58,3%, 75.0%, and 91,5% respectively). The added total picture\narea was then divided by the total text-face resulting in an \"es-\ntimated picture area index\".\n209 Calculation results\nTo be able to compare the three methods the differences be-\ntween the \"real picture area index\" and the two \"estimated pic-\nture area indexes\" were calculated. As we can see in the table\nbelow these differences are small with both methods.\nEstimation with quarters resulted in a mean difference of 2.3%,\nand estimation with sixths resulted in a mean difference of .4%.\nThese results indicate that the method of \"Estimation with\nquarters\" is \"good enough\" for practical work. This method is\nvery quick and easy and far less labour-intensive than the la-\nborious method of exact measurement.\nThe picture area index (%)\nThe picture area index Book 1 Book 2 Book 3\nNumber of pictures in chapter 16.0 37.0 53.0\nNumber of pages 21.0 23.0 26.0\nThe real picture area index 26.9 32.6 26.5\nEstimated picture area index, quarters 25.0 29.9 32.2\nDifference 1 1.9 2.7 5.7\nThe real picture area index 26.9 32.6 26.5\nEstimated picture area index, sixths 27.0 34.0 30,5\nDifference 2 0.1 1.4 4.0\nIt would be interesting to make a collection of picture area\nindex-data for \"typical textbooks\" used in different countries. At\nthe same time one should also calculate the \"picture index\", de-\nfined as the average number of pictures for 100 pages (Petters-\nson, 1990).\n210 Also see the discussion on the verbal and visual area dia-\ngram in the section Text, picture, and background in the chap-\nter Information graphics.\n211 Graphic symbols\nTaking up only a very small amount of space, symbols can pro-\nvide or convey information, equivalent to one or more sentences\nof text. Eco (1976) suggested that the verbal equivalent of an\niconic sign is not a word but a phrase or indeed a whole story.\nThis is, of course, also the case with the large number of Chinese\nkanji-characters, designating different words or sometimes\nphrases.\nUse of graphic symbols\nThe use of graphic symbols has a long tradition. Functional,\ninstructive graphic symbols are actually older than words. They\nare found in every culture however primitive. In specific areas\nsymbols are a supplement to all languages to help create better\nand faster understanding. Symbols first appeared as paintings\nor carvings on caves and stone walls as early as 50,000 BC, with\nthe first depiction of humans dating back about 11,000 years\n(Dewar, 1999). There is also a need for various symbols in mod-\nern societies.\nSince 1974, the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)\nand the United States Department of Transportation (DOT)\nhave collaborated to a symbol system that will help travellers\nnavigate their way through airports, bus and train stations,\nlarge international events, and unfamiliar public places. This\nsystem, 2013 consisting of 50 symbols, is designed to guide\npeople, regardless of age or culture, to where they are trying to\ngo or what they are trying to reach.\n212 Groups of graphic symbols\nI distinguish between two main categories of representations,\n(I) figurative representations, and (II) non-figurative represen-\ntations (Pettersson, 2002). Figurative representations include\ntwo groups, 1) visuals and 2) graphic symbols. The group\ngraphic symbols include three subgroups 1) pictorial symbols,\n2) abstract symbols, and 3) arbitrary symbols.\nPictorial symbols\nPictorial symbols (or representational symbols) are \u201cimage re-\nlated\u201d and simplified pictures. Pictorial symbols resemble the\nobjects they represent. They can be characterized as silhouettes,\nshadows, or profiles with no surface detail. A traffic sign with a\nsilhouette of a locomotive, to denote a railroad crossing, is an\nexample of a pictorial symbol. In the design process, some pic-\ntorial symbols may be successively simplified into abstract\ngraphic symbols.\nAbstract symbols\nAbstract graphic symbols can look like the objects they repre-\nsent but have less detail than pictorial symbols. Good abstract\ngraphic symbols are intuitive and we should be able to under-\nstand their meaning.\nThe modern symbols typically found in airports and in\ntravel guides are intended to convey generalities of the same\norder of abstractness as words. Their characteristic graphic neu-\ntrality is perhaps the most significant aspect of their invention\nby the Isotype Institute (Neurath, 1936).\nIn athletic contests, like the Olympic games, abstract\ngraphic symbols are often used to denote the different sports.\nGood abstract graphic symbols are intuitive and we should be\nable to understand their meaning.\n213 Arbitrary symbols\nSome figurative symbols are arbitrary symbols. They are in-\nvented and constructed out of the designer's imagination. Usu-\nally arbitrary graphic symbols have no resemblance at all to the\nobjects or the ideas they represent. Many are based only on the\nuse of geometric shapes and colours. Many signposts and some\ntraffic signs are examples of signs with arbitrary symbols. Arbi-\ntrary symbols are unambiguous by convention. We agree and\ndecide on their meaning. Just as new terms have to be learned\nwhen we begin to study a new topic; we have to learn arbitrary\ngraphic symbols. Every motorist has to pass a test in order to\nget a driver\u2019s licence.\nCochenour, Rezabek and Westhoff (1998) studied the in-\nterpretations of 12 arbitrary graphic symbols. In this case, 96\nrespondents showed a wide disparity in their interpretations,\nwith as many as 51 different categories of meaning for a single\nsymbol. The average number of no-meaning responses was 13.\nVisual terms\nQuirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik (1985) noted that picto-\ngrams most reliably can substitute for words in \u201cblock lan-\nguage\u201d \u2013 single-word captions, headings, and labels \u2013 as dis-\ntinct from sentenced language. Graphic symbols may be in-\ntended to convey generalities of the same order of abstractness\nas verbal terms. In some cases we can see graphic symbols as\nvisual terms.\nSymbols may be visually more distinctive than text. Their\nsyntax and semantics may be simpler. Image perception is\nrapid, virtually \u201cinstantaneous\u201d. Reading and comprehending\nthe equivalent message in words takes much more time, and\nmay fail if it is hard to read the text. So symbols permit rapid\n214 reading and comprehension, and they may require less time and\neffort for learning. This is important in numerous situations,\ne.g., in traffic, in industry, and in aviation.\nObjectives\nThere are many reasons to use symbols. Graphical symbols can\nbe used effectively in manuals and on screens to help readers to\nquickly recognize and identify a specific message. Symbols can\nbe used to create an overview and provide a holistic perspective.\nThis property is utilized in maps and informative signs as well\nas in catalogues and project reports.\nGraphic symbols may be used to identify information, il-\nlustrate spatial and geographic position, illustrate size relation-\nships, navigate in databases, provide a holistic perspective, rec-\nognize information, and represent an organization, a service, or\na product. Graphic symbols may supply information and supply\ninstructions. Graphic symbols have evolved to the point of uni-\nversal acceptance in such areas as music, mathematics, and in\nmany branches of science.\nPettersson (1985, 1987) concluded that perceived image\ncontent often is different from intended image content. Even\nsimple pictures and also symbols may cause many different as-\nsociations. A given set of basic picture elements and symbols\ncan be combined to form completely different images. Moriarty\nand Sayre (1993) studied intended and perceived advertising\nmeanings. They also found a high level of disagreement between\nintended and perceived messages. More than half of the re-\nsponses were different from those intended, and expected by\nthe message creators. Symbols must be meaningful, legible,\nlearnable, memorable and used consistently (Dewar, 1999).\n215 Interpretation of meaning\nThe meaning of a symbol is seldom easy to guess (Pettersson,\n1989, 1993). Griffin and Gibbs (1993) and Olmstead (1999)\nfound that graphic symbols were interpreted in many different\nways. Sometimes only a few persons will understand the in-\ntended meaning of a symbol. Thus, the sender will always have\nto supply explanations for the symbols used in any specific\nsituation.\nSymbols in business presentations\nGriffin et al. (1994) studied how international business people\ninterpreted and understood commonly used clip art symbols.\nThe symbols were taken from a Harward Graphics software\npackage for business presentations. Based on 4.530 opinions\nexpressed by 302 subjects in Japan, Sweden, Tanzania and\nUSA, regarding 15 of the symbols in the software package, Grif-\nfin et al. made the following two conclusions:\n\u2022 There are many ways to interpret symbols. Very few people\nshare the same understanding of any given symbol.\n\u2022 There are strong cultural differences in interpreting the\nmeanings of symbols.\nFour verbal symbols resulted in many interesting observations.\nSymbols in this category were either understood or not under-\nstood at all. There were 90% appropriate answers from the sub-\njects in the USA and 80% from the subjects in Sweden. For Tan-\nzania and Japan, the corresponding numbers were 27% and\n29% respectively. The rank ordering of the mean numbers of\nappropriate answers for seven pictorial symbols was 80% for\nUSA, 69% for Sweden, 60% for Tanzania, and 48% for Japan.\n216 The remaining four abstract symbols were the most diffi-\ncult symbols for all audiences to comprehend. Here definitions\ndiffered strongly by symbol and by country. In this study, it was\ncommon for the subjects to give several meanings for each sym-\nbol. For example, the 81 Swedish subjects gave 20 different in-\nterpretations of a symbol with the shape of a star.\nTelecom symbols\nNilsson and Lindqvist (1995) examined a random selection of\ntelecom publications. They browsed about 1,000 pages. From\nthis material they selected 100 pictures and registered about\n350 symbols. This study concluded that:\n\u2022 A certain meaning is explained with several different sym-\nbols.\n\u2022 A certain symbol has several different meanings.\nWithin the Swedish R&D-company Ellemtel, several people de-\nsigned their own graphic symbols, which they used in various\ncombinations in schematic pictures in their own documents. In\na sample of documents no less than 29 different \u201ctelephone-\npictures\u201d were used. Some of the telephone-pictures were well-\ndrawn schematic pictures, some were pictorial symbols, and\nsome were abstract symbols. All these symbols were replaced by\ntwo graphic abstract symbols for telephones, passive, and active\nto be used in schematic pictures.\nSepulchral symbols\nCochenour and Rezabek (1997) studied the interpretations of 21\nsepulchral symbols. Respondents showed a wide disparity re-\ngarding their ability to understand the meanings of the symbols.\nNineteen percent of the responses indicated that no meaning at\n217 all was conveyed, while 31% were considered as \u201cunderstanding\nof the intended meaning\u201d.\nIt was concluded that symbols carry a variety of meanings\nfor different people and when used alone as a means of visual\ncommunication cannot be expected to always convey a simple\nand direct meaning.\nInternational communication\nAt the end of his book on writing for science and technology,\nKirkman (1992) noted the possibility of using symbols in inter-\nnational communication (p. 155): \u201cPerhaps, since use of words\ncauses so much difficulty in international communication, we\nshould abandon words wherever possible, and use icons in-\nstead.\u201d\nKirkman used the term \u201cicon\u201d in the same meaning as I use\nthe term \u201csymbol\u201d here. Symbols may very well become more\nand more common in international communication. Kirkman\ncommented (p. 156): \u201cI have no doubt that we shall gradually\nhave to include more and more icons in our presentations of\ninformation, especially in our onscreen presentations.\u201d\nMany pictograms are culturally biased (Mangan, 1978) and\nthus arbitrary to those from other cultures. For example, when\nusing a guidebook with symbols, we often have to look them up\nin a key in much the same way as we look up unfamiliar words\nin a dictionary. Their iconic origins may only become apparent\nafter we are aware of their intended meaning (Waller, 1987).\nBaron (1981) reported that iconicity is a surprisingly unimpor-\ntant factor in the learning of sign languages for the deaf, autis-\ntic, or mentally retarded.\n218 Warnings\nMany symbols are used for warnings. Wogalter (1999, p. 94)\nconcluded that warnings should contain certain elements:\n\u2022 A signal word such as \u201cDanger\u201d and \u201cCaution\u201d that enables\npeople to recognize that the message is a warning, that a\nhazard is present, as well as providing information on the\nhazard level (with \u201cDanger\u201d signalling more serious and\nprobable injury than \u201cCaution\u201d);\n\u2022 A description of the hazard, e.g. in the case of a no diving\nsign, a statement such as \u201cShallow water\u201d provides informa-\ntion about the specific danger involved;\n\u2022 A description of the consequences that could occur if the\nperson fails to obey the warning\u2019s directions, e.g. \u201cYou can\nbe permanently paralysed\u201d;\n\u2022 The directions or instructions, i.e., the specific actions that\nshould or should not be done, e.g. \u201cNo diving\u201d.\nTraffic signs\nTraffic signs and signposts are various devices with symbols,\nplaced along, beside, or above a highway, roadway, pathway, or\nany other route in order to guide and help with directions, regu-\nlate the traffic and warn for dangers. The symbols may also be\npainted on the streets, and sometimes on the walls of houses.\nThe traffic may include many kinds of motor vehicles, bicycles,\npedestrians, equestrians, and other travellers.\nRoad signs and signposts may be divided into four main\ngroups: 1) warning signs, 2) mandatory signs, 3) prohibitory\nsigns, 4) information signs, and the STOP sign. Today road\nsigns are manufactured in different materials such as alu-\nminium, galvanized sheet iron, and flat or canned panel. The\n219 symbols on the signs may be painted, printed or duplicated in\nother ways. The motifs are designed in different ways even if\nthey carry the same or similar messages.\nIn order to be effective a warning must reach the intended\naudience and make them adopt the desired behaviour. Several\nsteps are needed here. Initially any warning, and any symbol,\nmust attract and capture the attention of the intended audience,\nthe persons who need the information. The message must be\nlegible at the appropriate distance, and must often be legible\nwhen seen for a short period of time under bad lighting condi-\ntions. A driver on a highway may only have a second or two to\nread a signpost. Then the message in the warning must be men-\ntally processed and understood correctly by the intended audi-\nence. The action to be taken should be immediately obvious.\nFurthermore the message in the warning must be able to moti-\nvate the audience to comply with the desired behaviour.\nWogalter pointed out that warnings should have properties\nthat allow them to be seen in degraded conditions such as low\nillumination, smoke or fog. In addition warnings should be ad-\nequately lit by direct light or by backlighting and/or have good\nreflectance so that they are visible under reduced-light condi-\ntions.\nThe United States Department of Transportation (2002)\nsays that roadway signs in the United States increasingly use\nsymbols rather than words to convey their messages. Thus it is\nimportant that these symbols maintain a consistency in colour,\nlayout, position, shape, space, and text.\nProject \u201ccrossing road signs\u201d\nIn communication senders want to communicate messages or\nmake information sets available to receivers or rather interpret-\n220 ers. In the case of warning for and information about pedestrian\ncrossing road signs the city authorities are the senders. The\nwarning sign for a pedestrian crossing convey a simple, but\nimportant message to the motorists: \u201cLook out and slow down,\nthere is a pedestrian crossing ahead.\u201d\nThe warning sign is usually triangular, sometimes with soft\ncorners. The actual symbol consists of a wide line forming a red\ntriangle on a light background. Graphical elements, dots, lines,\nand areas, are combined to form a simple figurative and ab-\nstract representation of a person. Some graphical elements may\nalso represent street lines showing a pedestrian crossing.\nA warning sign and an infor-\nmation sign (from Germany\nand Lithuania). These sym-\nbols are classified as abstract.\nThe information sign is usually rectangular, sometimes\nwith soft corners. This particular sign is from Lithuania. The\ntriangle is white. The four graphical elements representing a\nperson and the three graphical elements representing street\nlines are black. The person appears to be running to the right.\nThis symbol is classified as abstract. In Lithuania there are also\nsigns with the person moving to the left. Graphical elements,\ndots, lines, and areas, are combined to form a simple figurative\nrepresentation of a person. Some graphical elements may also\nrepresent street lines showing a pedestrian crossing\nAn information sign about a pedestrian crossing convey\nslightly different messages for two different groups of receivers.\nThe message to the motorists and other road-users is: \u201cLook out\n221 and slow down, pedestrians are told to cross the street here.\u201d\nThe message to the pedestrians is: \u201cThis is the place where you\nshould cross the street.\u201d\nIn several locations this information sign is replaced by\ntraffic lights. Traffic lights convey more distinct and \u201csharp\u201d\ninstructions to motorists as well as to pedestrians than pedes-\ntrian crossing warning and information road signs. Here the\ninstructions may be expressed as: Drive now!, Do not drive!,\nWalk now!, and Do not walk! respectively. The design of traffic\nlights may vary substantially. However, design of traffic lights is\nnot included in this study, and not the sign explaining that chil-\ndren may be playing alongside the road as well as on the road.\nI have studied 52 different pedestrian warning and infor-\nmation crossing road signs from 32 countries (Argentina,\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, China, Cyprus, Czech Repub-\nlic, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Iceland, India, Ireland,\nItaly, Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco,\nNorway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Turkey, and USA). Some of these road signs were\nbrought to Stockholm for a public exhibition in 1998. The\ngraphic designer Anders K\u00f6rling put together the exhibition The\nWorld Walks in Stockholm as an event during Stockholm \u201898,\nStockholm \u2013 Cultural City of Europe 1998.\nI have taken photographs of the crossing road signs at this\nexhibition. I have also taken photographs during my travels in\nvarious countries. In addition, people have provided me with\nphotographs of crossing road signs in a few cases. The pictures\npresented in this report have been scanned and retouched using\nAdobe PhotoshopTM. The design of pedestrian warning and in-\nformation crossing road signs wary with respect to shape,\ncolours, size, and number of graphic elements in the symbols.\n222 Pedestrian warning and information crossing road signs\nwary with respect to their shape, colours, size, and the design of\nthe figurative representations. Differences in material and in\nthe construction of the signs and signposts are not discussed\nhere.\nShape\nPedestrian crossing warning and information road signs vary in\nshape in different parts of the world. In Europe warning signs\nare triangular, and information signs are rectangular. In other\nparts of the world the information sign may be rhombic or cir-\ncular. On the signs from Argentina and Australia (below) the\npictorial symbols are black on yellow backgrounds without indi-\ncations of street lines.\nThe rhombic sign is from\nArgentina. The circular sign\nis from Australia.\nThese symbols are classified\nas pictorial.\nColours\nPedestrian crossing warning and information road signs vary in\ncolour in different parts of the world. In Europe warning signs\nusually have white, black and red colours. In Sweden warning\nsigns are yellow, red and black. In many countries the informa-\ntion signs are blue, white and black. In some countries the\ncolours are white and blue; white, yellow and black; or yellow\nand black. The figurative representations are usually black, on a\nwhite, blue or yellow ground.\n223 Size\nPedestrian crossing warning and information road signs vary in\nsize in accordance with different situations. In this sample the\nsmallest sign is 40 cm (Cyprus) and the largest is 102 cm (Ar-\ngentina). Most signs are between 55 and 75 cm. Thus the im-\npression of the pictures printed here corresponds to the impres-\nsion from viewing the real signs on a distance of five to seven\nmetres.\nMr. Walker\nThe symbol on pedestrian crossing warning and information\nroad signs varies to a large extent. Almost all are different with\nrespect to their design. The person in the symbol is always \u201cMr.\nWalker\u201d. Nowhere is the figure representing a woman (Jofs,\n1998). (However, in 2010 Sweden introduced Mrs. Walker.) In\nthis study Mr. Walker is an abstract graphic symbol (27), or a\npictorial graphic symbol (25).\nAs would be expected, there are no arbitrary graphic sym-\nbols in this sample of symbols. In one case (Australia) the sign\nonly shows the lower parts of the legs and the feet. For some\nreason most figures on the signs (44) are crossing the street to\nthe left. The remaining figures (8) cross in the other direction,\nto the right. Estonia and Lithuania have both versions of signs.\nMost figures (42) seem to be walking across the street over\nto the other side, but some (9) appear to be running. In one case\n(Mexico) the figure appears to be standing and waiting for a\npossibility to cross the street. In two other symbols from Mexico\nthe person appears to be walking. Some symbols are very clear\nand distinct; others are \u201cblurred\u201d by a large number of graphical\nelements.\n224 The person is an abstract graphic symbol on the left warning\nsign from Malta, and a pictorial graphic symbol on the middle\nsign from Switzerland. In both cases the person is apparently\nwalking to the left. The number of graphical elements varies to\na large degree. On the sign to the right, from France, there are\na total of 21 graphical elements. However, Mr. Walker consists\nof only one graphical element.\nThe numbers of graphical elements that are used to build\nthe Mr. Walker figure vary (1\u20134), as the total number of graphi-\ncal elements (2\u201321) in the symbols. The painted street lines\nform a graphic world of their own. The number varies to a large\ndegree. In some cases the street lines may actually confuse peo-\nple. Some signs have no street lines. I don\u2019t know to what extent\nthe number of street lines varies in different countries. In\nSweden there are four graphical elements on the symbols repre-\nsenting the lines painted on the streets. The number of painted\nlines may vary.\nMessage and symbol\nThere are probably pedestrian crossing road signs in most cit-\nies, at least where there are cars. In accordance with interna-\ntional conventions and national legislations on road signs and\nsignals, most road signs have a similar design. For example, the\nofficial manual for signing in the United States is the Manual of\nUniform Traffic Control Devices. Warning signs are triangular.\n225 Information or instructional signs are rectangular or rhombic.\nProhibitory signs and mandatory signs are round, but with dif-\nferent colours. However, the symbols on the signs may differ in\nseveral respects. Every country has its own version, or rather\nversions, because some road signs differ between regions. Some\nof these signs may be old versions, waiting to be replaced.\nThere are several requirements that must be fulfilled for\nroad signs to be effective communicators of information. The\ndesigns of the symbols, as well as the contexts in which the\nsigns appear are important factors for our perception of the\nmessage. The abstract or pictorial graphic symbol on the sign\nmust have good legibility and be easy to read from a distance.\nObviously pedestrian crossing road signs must be placed in such\na way that the motorists as well as the pedestrians can see them.\nSigns should be placed as necessary for safety and proper regu-\nlation of traffic. However, the use of too many signs within a\ngiven location severely reduces the effectiveness of each indi-\nvidual sign at that specific location. There is a distinct risk that\nwe will not see, or pay attention to, some of the signs.\nIt is quite obvious that traffic symbols are designed in many\ndifferent ways, even when they convey the same or similar in-\nformation to people who see them. This may not seem to be an\nimportant issue, since people have to learn the meaning of all-\nimportant symbols within their own society. However, with re-\nspect to the fact that international travel seems to increase all\nthe time, and more people visit different countries, it would\nprobably be an advantage to have a \u201cworld standard\u201d for a set of\nbasic symbols, including traffic signs. This would probably re-\nduce the number of misunderstandings and traffic accidents.\nThe above study supports the assumptions noted in the\nintroduction. We may conclude that:\n226 1. A specific message may be communicated to the receiver/s\nor interpreter/s with several different symbols.\n2. A specific symbol may be used to communicate several dif-\nferent messages.\n3. People have to learn the meaning of all-important symbols\nwithin their own society.\nThe first two points may also be visually represented in the fol-\nlowing two schematic pictures:\nA specific message (left red circle) may be communicated to the\nreceiver/s or interpreter/s (right red circle) with several dif-\nferent symbols (middle blue circles) as long as people learn the\nintended meanings of the symbols.\nA specific symbol (middle blue circle) may be used to com-\nmunicate several different messages (left circles) to the re-\nceiver/s (right circles) as long as people learn the intended\nmeanings of the symbol.\nWith respect to the design and the use of symbols it may\nfurther be concluded that:\n227 1. Receivers may interpret symbols in many ways.\n\u2013 Few people share the same understanding of any given\nsymbol.\n\u2013 People can usually not guess the meaning of symbols.\n\u2013 There are strong cultural differences in interpreting the\nmeanings of symbols.\n2. The senders will always have to supply explanations for\nsymbols.\n\u2013 Symbols should be used in a consistent way.\n\u2013 A symbol must always have the same meaning within a\nspecified context.\n3. A good symbol is designed so it can be used in many differ-\nent situations and in many contexts. A good symbol:\n\u2013 Is simple\n\u2013 Is clear\n\u2013 Has optimal size\n\u2013 Has good contrast in form, dimension, and colour\n4. Graphical symbols may be intended to convey generalities of\nthe same order of abstractness as verbal terms. In some\ncases we can see graphical symbols as visual terms. Graphi-\ncal symbols may be used to:\n\u2013 Create an overview\n\u2013 Identify information\n\u2013 Illustrate position\n\u2013 Illustrate size relationships\n\u2013 Navigate in databases\n\u2013 Provide a holistic perspective\n\u2013 Recognize information\n\u2013 Represent an organization, a service, or a product\n\u2013 Supply information or instructions\n228 Design of graphic symbols\nWith the increase in international travel and trade, there is a\ngrowing need to communicate with people who do not under-\nstand the language of the country they are in. The use of sym-\nbols is one of the most common ways to deal with this situation.\nHowever, there may also be some disadvantages with symbols.\nSymbols may be less efficient than text in conveying abstract, as\nwell as detailed information.\nDewar (1999) pointed out that the specific criteria for indi-\nvidual symbols or sets of symbols depend on their application.\nLegibility distance is essential in the case of traffic signs and\nmany building signs, but not for symbols on maps or consumer\nproducts. There is a need to have as much uniformity as pos-\nsible across different information systems.\nWhen designers in different countries are working on simi-\nlar problems they may create different solutions and different\ndesigns. In each case, they may have clear intentions and objec-\ntives with his or her information sets. However, it is always up\nto the interpreter/s to conceive or misconceive information, to\nuse or not use it, to use or misuse it. It is reasonable to assume\nthat 1) a specific message may be communicated to the re-\nceiver/s or interpreter/s with several different symbols. It is\nalso reasonable to assume that 2) a specific symbol may be used\nto communicate several different messages. If the assumptions\nabove are correct it would indicate that 3) we will normally have\nto learn the intended meaning of symbols.\nSymbols are often composed of simple graphical elements,\nsuch as lines, circles, ovals, squares, rectangles, triangles, or\ncombinations thereof. Distinctively shaped letters are often\nutilized in modern symbols. Regular, simple, geometrical fig-\nures are identified more quickly than complex ones. Keates\n229 (1982) noted that discriminatory responses to map symbols de-\npend on contrast in form, dimension, and colour. The problem\nof discrimination is generally more critical in monochrome\nmaps, in which only contrasts in form and dimensions are pos-\nsible for lines and small symbols.\nRestriction Warning Prohibition Direction\nLeft Right Motion Up\nDown In Out Increase\nHere are some basic symbols that appear and reappear in\nmany different situations in various countries throughout the\nworld.\nThe graphic symbol should be simple and clear with a dis-\ntinct contrast to the background. A clear and stable figure to\nground articulation is essential (Dewar, 1999; Easterby, 1970).\nThe figure (\u201cforeground\u201d) should be stable, i.e. spontaneously\norganised as one unit. This is achieved by close boundaries, ap-\npropriate line thickness and any other graphical means that\nhelp the visual system to organise the figure as one unit. It is\nmost appropriate to use silhouette (side) views of certain com-\nponents such as vehicles (Dewar, 1999). The graphic symbol\n230 should be as symmetrical as possible. It should appear in an\noptimal size.\nA good symbol is designed so it can be used in many differ-\nent situations and in many contexts. For example, the McDon-\nald\u2019s M or \u201cgolden arch\u201d is designed to work in every conceiv-\nable size, from a few millimetres high in a brochure to more\nthan six feet high in outdoor signs. It is often an advantage that\na symbol is iconic, that is, that it looks like the real thing it rep-\nresents. Then it may be intuitive to the users. In technical and\nscientific systems and documentation, hardware may be sym-\nbolised by squares and rectangles or the like. Softer forms, such\nas circles or ovals, may represent software.\nGraphic symbols often make use of bright colours to inten-\nsify their meaning \u2013 in fact in some instances a change of colour\ncreates a diametric change of meaning. Common hues are pure\nyellow, red, blue, green, white and black, or combinations of the\nsame. Colour creates instant impact. It becomes a vital part of\nthe first impression created. Industry employs colour coding in\nmany areas. The countless wires in a complex cable are in-\nstantly traced by their hue; the colours of knobs and buttons on\nvehicles and machinery signify what they control (Dreyfuss,\n1972).\nHowever, since many people are colour-blind colour can\nonly be used to code the information redundantly. Colour may\nbe combined with shape or position. Complementary colours\ncontrast and provide a warm \u2013 cool effect. Colours may have\nmany different meanings; some common meanings and their\nattention getting values are listed in the table on next page.\n231 Colours and their attention getting values.\nHue Meaning Attention\nAlarm, danger, financial loss, fire, heat, stop,\nRed Good\nunsafe, warning\nOrange Warning Good\nYellow Caution, danger, hazard, oil, slow, warning Good\nGreen Go, normal state, safe, satisfactory Poor\nLight blue Advisory, aerated water, cool Bad\nDark blue Advising, untreated water Poor\nMagenta Alarm state Good\nWhite Advisory, stem Poor\nBlack Financial gain Poor\nWarnings should have high contrast relative to the back-\nground (Barlow & Wogalter, 1991; Sanders & McGormick,\n1993). They should have large, legible bold-faced alphanumeric\ncharacters (Wogalter, 1999). Legibility of symbols can be en-\nhanced with the application of a few simple guidelines:\n\u2022 Use realistic figures rather than abstract forms.\n\u2022 Make important figures and characters large.\n\u2022 Eliminate unnecessary elements.\n\u2022 Use solid figures, not outline figures.\n\u2022 Maximize separation between features in symbols.\n\u2022 Maximize the luminance between a symbol and its back-\nground.\n\u2022 Maximize the colour contrast between a symbol and its\nbackground.\n232 According to Keates (1982), the use of colour on maps intro-\nduces a large number of variables that can enhance contrast,\nand therefore extend the number of perceptual differences that\ncan be employed in discrimination. The effect is to aid legibility,\nand therefore to increase the total range of information which\nthe map can present. Shape and colour components are often\nused for designating a link or relationship between groups of\nmessages. The recognition of geographical features is much en-\nhanced when areas are differentiated by hue. At the same time,\ncomplex colour arrangements may raise problems in discrimi-\nnation, so that although multi-colour maps enlarge the graphic\npossibilities, they also increase the probability of errors in the\njudgment of discrimination.\nAccording to Keates (1982), the most common case of\nquantitative judgment on maps occurs in the use of propor-\ntional symbols, that is, point or line symbols constructed to rep-\nresent specific quantities. Cochenour, Lee and Wilkins (1995)\nprovided the following design guidelines for functional image\nmaps on the World Wide Web (p. 172):\n\u2022 Use simple graphics.\n\u2022 Use smaller rather than larger image sizes.\n\u2022 Clearly define hot spots.\n\u2022 Use unified rather than scattered groupings.\n\u2022 Choose icons to accurately represent information.\n\u2022 Design image maps to model the structure of information.\n\u2022 Use a minimal number of layers.\n\u2022 Limit the number of choices.\n\u2022 Include site-specific help.\nBefore beginning to design new symbols, it is a good idea to\nconsider employing already existing symbols. Standardisation\n233 bodies like ISO (International Standards Organisation) and IEC\n(Commissioin Electrotechnique Internationale) officially rec-\nommend many symbols. There are a large number of existing\nsymbols for different areas. Symbols are employed in different\nmedia. They are static and immutable in graphical media and\nmay be more changeable in computer-based media. As noted in\nthe introduction designers in different countries may be work-\ning on similar problems, and they will often create different de-\nsigns. Most, if not all, countries have traffic signs. In order to\nstudy similarities and differences in the design of a highly re-\nstricted message I have analyzed pedestrian warning and in-\nformation signs. This study is presented in the following sec-\ntion.\n234 Information graphics\nA particular message is sometimes presented through the pur-\nposeful integration of text, pictures, and graphic design into a\nclearly delineated and structured area, i.e., a functioning whole.\n(However, nowadays this term is used in a broader sense.) The\nresult of this work is a product called information graphics, in-\nfographics, or just \u201cgraphics\u201d. Infographics are widely used in\nnewspapers and newscasts (Lamb et al., 2014; Smiciklas, 2012).\nExamples of confusing, misleading, and ineffective graphics\nare everywhere. The three essential elements of good informa-\ntion graphics are rich content, inviting visualizations, and so-\nphisticated execution (Wong, 2010, p. 14). Rich content brings\nmeaning to the graphic. Inviting visualizations interprets the\ncontent and highlights the essence of the information for the\nreader. Sophisticated execution brings the content and the\ngraphics to life.\nGraphics\nInformation graphics are informative and may be entertaining.\nThey aid communication, enabling better understanding and\ncomprehension. Information graphics are attention-getters\nwhen they appear on a page in a newspaper. They may improve\nreadability and increase retention. In the past, information\ngraphics were produced by hand, a tedious work process. Today\nmost information graphics are produced with computers. Ideas\ncan be tested in less time and good solutions may be found. In\nthe case of newspapers, information graphics can be the key to\nattract new readers and to hold on to old readers.\nMost visualizations originating from quantitative data in-\nclude axes or scales, coordinate systems, or glyphs that use spe-\n235 cific data values as an input (Schroeder & Martin, 2005; Tver-\nsky, 2011). The appearance of a glyph corresponds directly to\ndata as a result of the principled mapping of data variables to\nvisual features such as position, size, shape, and colour (Heer,\nBostock, & Ogievetsky, 2010, p. 67).\nInformation graphics provide the reader with a rapid and\neasily grasped overall view of a message and are therefore\nhighly suitable as an introduction to and summary of a subject.\nHowever, conventionally illustrated text is better for analysis,\ndiscussion, and study of details. So information in graphical\nmedia can utilize text, pictures, information graphics, and\ngraphical design in conveying its message. We should note that\nthe word \u201cgraphics\u201d can be used for completely different con-\ncepts:\n1. One or more art forms in which copies can be made on pa-\nper or the same original.\n2. Activity involving the printing of the written word.\n3. Integrated presentation of text, pictures, and graphical de-\nsign, in, e.g., the daily press, information graphics.\n4. The technique of presenting data in the form of figures on a\nvideo display screen.\nWainer (2009, p. 31) observed: \u201cgraphical representation has\nbeen shown repeatedly over the past two hundred years to be\nperhaps the best way to communicate complex technical infor-\nmation to an intelligent, lay audience.\u201d\nModern information graphics has its origin in the tradition\nof making posters and advertisements. These visual forms of\ncommunication spring from a past in older times, when pictures\nand texts were combined into information on circus and theatre\nposters, and on signs on inns. The oldest posters were created at\n236 the end of the 14th century, when printing on paper started in\nEurope. Leaflets with text and simple pictures were used by\nbooksellers and travelling theatre companies and for political\nagitation. The posters\u2019 roots are traced back to antique Athens,\nwhere the City Fathers put up notices with regulations.\nOn the 15 September 1982, a new type of daily paper was\npublished in the USA. From a central editorial office in Arling-\nton, Virginia, the produced pages were sent via a satellite to\nprinting houses in eleven cities, where USA TODAY was\nprinted. As early as after one year, the daily edition was more\nthan one million copies. Today, the paper is widely spread in the\nUSA and in several other countries. The paper is as fragmented\nas the news on television, and is often being criticized for being\ntoo superficial.\nUSA TODAY is the paper of the television generation. It is\ndivided into four separate sections: news, money, sports, and\nlife. Each section has its own cover story and a large number of\neasily read mini-notices. The headings are effective, and the text\nis often heavily edited. The notice has replaced the article. There\nare many photographs, drawings, diagrams, and tables in the\npaper. USA TODAY introduced modern information graphics,\nand has been imitated all over the world. It is the most copied\npaper in modern times.\nBaer and Vaccara (2010) provided a range of interesting\ncase studies, from print projects to interactive and envi-\nronmental information systems.\nAccording to Lankow (2012) a test of the efficacy of an in-\nfographic is based on the first-century architect, author, and\nengineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollios principles of good design. We\nneed to measure the utility, the soundness, and the beauty of\ninfographics. Utility refers to whether the infographic meets the\n237 designer\u2019s objectives or not. Soundness refers to whether the\ninformation presented in the infographic is complete, correct,\nand valuable to the viewer. Beauty refers to whether or not the\ndesign of the infographic is appealing and appropriate.\nObjectives\nAccording to Malamed (2011) the goal with information graph-\nics is to re-present data in such a way that the intended audi-\nence is able to quickly grasp the content primarily by sight. In-\nfographics are a popular visual approach to deliver abstract,\ncomplex, and dense messages in small areas (Lamb et al., 2014).\nIn order to facilitate an audience\u2019s engagement any in-\nfographic must exhibit appearance and explanation (Stone &\nHall, 1997). Visual appeal attracts viewers\u2019 attention. The expla-\nnatory power of the infographic makes complex subject matter\napprehensible and intelligible.\nInformation graphics can be classified according to differ-\nent criteria, such as objectives, medium, size, and time for pro-\nduction (Pettersson, 1993). One specific graphic may very well\nbelong to several of these groups. We can produce information\ngraphics in order to achieve several different objectives.\nContent graphics or everyday graphics are used for infor-\nmation about the content in packages, e.g., with food. Decora-\ntive and artistic graphics can also be found in both newspapers\nand television. Even though informative graphics can be both\ndecorative and aesthetically attractive, the informative function\nalways predominates. So purely decorative and artistic graphics\nare not information graphics. Explanatory graphics depict the\nways things were, are, or will be, for example, the weather.\nThese graphics range from simple drawings to complex combi-\nnations of drawings, maps, and photographs.\n238 Expo graphics are used at exhibitions and trade fairs. A\nsubject matter is presented using verbal and visual technique\nand the real objects. The graphical information may aid under-\nstanding of how the real objects can be used. Instruction graph-\nics are used for instructions, e.g., in instructional manuals. In-\nstruction graphics may deal with how to use, e.g., a machine or\nhow to prepare, e.g., a meal step by step. Locating graphics are\nused to give the physical location of an event or of an object.\nBased on one or more maps, movements of an object can be\nexplained. Maps are often also included in other kinds of graph-\nics.\nNews graphics are used to convey all kinds of news that are\nfit to see rather than to read as a printed story. News graphics\nare found in, e.g., newspapers and some magazines, and also on\ntelevision. Presentation graphics depict facts and are often used\nfor different types of statistical tabulations. A graph or chart can\nbe integrated into a symbolic image to heighten impact and\nidentify the subject. Presentation graphics are often used for\n\u201cbusiness presentations\u201d. They are often called business graph-\nics. Signal graphics are small-scale graphics used to add impact\nand visual relief to a text.\nWe encounter information graphics in many different me-\ndia. In graphical media (books in particular), information\ngraphics are often referred to as lexivision or lexi-visual infor-\nmation. In the corresponding manner, lexigraphy is a special\nversion of infography for lexi-visual presentation of text, pic-\ntures, and information graphics in graphical media and com-\nputer media. Graphics are called reference book graphics in re-\nference books and dictionary graphics in dictionaries and ency-\nclopaedias.\n239 There are a number of different types of information graph-\nics, and we will probably see more types in the future (Lankow\net al., 2012; Marcel, 2014).\nTime for production\nThe American national daily newspaper USA TODAY was a pio-\nneer in the field of news graphics and has acquired imitators in\nmany different countries. \u201cNews graphics\u201d is a summarizing\ndesignation for several somewhat differing forms of information\ngraphics. Due to available time for production, news graphics\ncan be divided into several groups.\nBusiness graphics are found in computer programs and\nnewspapers. Business graphics is a general designation for in-\nformation graphics that present economic and statistical data,\nfor example: \u201cthe production of crude oil over the past five\nyears\u201d.\nDaily graphics is generally produced against tight dead-\nlines. News must be published in the next edition or in the next\nTV news slot.\nFeature graphics is a general designation for information\ngraphics that describe more timeless subjects, such as popular\nscience. Here, the producer may have several weeks or even\nmonths to create the copy and acquire the photographs.\nPlanned graphics is the designation for information graph-\nics that the editors of news graphics have a few days to produce.\nThis provides more opportunities for checking facts and more\ncarefully thought-out execution.\nWeather graphics are information graphics describing\nwhat the weather has been like and how it is likely to be accord-\ning to available forecasts. The colourful weather graphics in\n240 USA TODAY have inspired a large number of dailies to intro-\nduce information graphics.\nGeorge-Palilonis and Spillman (2013) asked 53 editors\nabout their attitudes and practices about use of infographics.\nMost editors supported production of infographics. However,\nthe availability of time and in-house expertise, as well as cost\neffectiveness influenced their decisions.\nEveryday graphics\nToday, we can study some of the classical posters from last cen-\ntury in art books and in museums, such as the Mus\u00e9e des Arts\nD\u00e9coratifs in Paris. It is possible \u2013 and even plausible \u2013 that\nsome of the information graphics of today will find their way\ninto art and design museums at the turn of this century or at the\nbeginning of the 21st Century. (See Information Design 6 \u2013\nPredecessors & Pioneers.)\nIn several respects, everyday graphics differs from other\ntypes of information graphics. Contrary to the producer of news\ngraphics, but in conformity with the producer of posters, the\nproducer of everyday graphics often has time enough to plan\nand design the messages in an optimal way. However, the space\nis often very limited for everyday graphics. The amount of the\narticle and the size of the product decide the space available for\nthe design of the verbal and visual message. In practice, how-\never, there is the same space for about the same amount of in-\nformation on a small label as on a normal-sized poster. When\nwe read a label of 4x4 cm at normal reading distance (30-40\ncm), it corresponds to a poster of 100 x 100 cm when reading it\nat a distance of 7-10 metres. When it comes to reading posters,\nthe most common way of reading is at a distance.\n241 Just as posters, everyday graphics have short and concen-\ntrated messages, expressed in a clear and distinct way. We read\neveryday graphics close at hand, but the retinal picture is about\nthe same as the retinal picture of a poster. Usually, we do not\ntake much interest in a label or a package. The same applies as\nfor posters: it must not take too much time to perceive the mes-\nsage in everyday graphics. Just one glance should be enough to\nperceive the contents of a package. Does the bag contain sugar,\nsalt, or pepper? Is there raspberry jam or strawberry jam in the\njar? Is the content poisonous, or harmful for us in any other\nway? In several respects almost the same conditions apply when\ntaking in information printed on a poster and on a label or a lid.\nWhen it comes to small packages, the message still has to\nbe designed in order to fit in all the necessary information.\nSometimes, there is a national law on how to describe the con-\ntents in detail. For some products, there may also exist different\ntypes of instruction, enclosed inside the package. As producers\nof posters, the producers of everyday graphics are usually totally\nanonymous to the consumers. In other forms of information\ngraphics, however, the names of the originators are often men-\ntioned, and thus known. Everyday graphics may have different\npurposes. It may be used to instruct, to inform, and to tempt a\npresumptive customer to buy the product in question.\nInstructing\nSometimes, schematic pictures are used to show how something\nis to be performed in several steps, in a practical, simple, quick,\nand safe way. One example is how to open a vacuum package\nwith cheese, and another example is how to put together several\nseparate parts in a box into a chair or a table. Symbols are often\nused. An arrow, for example, may be used to show where to\n242 open a package and to explain in which order and in which way\nto join different parts.\nInforming\nEveryday graphics informs on the contents of the package, and\nthe characteristics of the article or product. When it comes to\nprovisions, for example, there is a legislation in some countries\nthat sanctions that some types of data must be on the package.\nThis may be information on the contents of the product, day of\nmanufacture, keeping qualities, producer, and place of manu-\nfacture. Also trade agreements and practice within different\ntrades may demand that a certain kind of information \u2013 for ex-\nample, the price of a certain package and the price per kilogram\n\u2013 is presented to the customer/user.\nOften, a large and lifelike colour picture \u2013 a photograph or\na realistic drawing \u2013 gives the reader direct information or an\nassociation on the type of contents in the package. The picture\nis often reinforced with a heading in a large size of type and a\nclear typeface, often in upper-case letters. There is often a short\ntext with detailed information describing the characteristics of\nthe article or product.\nThe declaration of contents may be presented as a compact\ntable or a short text. These texts are often set in a small size of\ntype and printed in a colour with little contrast to the back-\nground. It always takes much more time to read the text than to\nread the picture.\n243 Two examples of everyday graphics printed directly on the lids\non individual portions of strawberry jam (life-size). The pro-\nducts are from Denmark (left) and Germany (right).\nA graphic symbol, such as an arrow, will often show where\nto get hold of the lid and the direction where to pull, in order to\nopen the package. Often a text and a logotype show the name of\nthe company that produced the jam. The address to the com-\npany may be small. There may also be information about the\nweight of the content as well as an identification code. Figures\nwritten with an ink-jet printer show when the jam was packaged\nand/or a \u201cbest-before date.\u201d\nEveryday graphics with clear pictures may also work inter-\nnationally, with people that do not know the language in ques-\ntion. Here, the context is very important. The pictures of or-\nanges, strawberries, raspberries, or peaches on individual por-\ntions of jam serve as a good guidance of the people who queue\nat the hotel's breakfast buffet. On several occasions, I have wit-\n244 nessed how people after a quick glance on different packages\nmake their choices. Obviously, just a few eye fixations on a\npackage are enough to tell the contents.\nAn example of everyday graphics printed directly on the lid on\ntwo individual portions from a company in the USA, with\nstrawberry jam and orange marmalade (life-size).\nTempting to buy\nOften, the purpose of everyday graphics is to tempt consumers\nto buy a certain product in competition with other, more or less\nsimilar and equally good, products. Regarding everyday graph-\nics, the \u201csender\u201d often has the possibility to turn to experts for\nhelp to design the message. Experienced marketing people and\npublicity expert\u2019s work closely together to produce verbal and\nvisual messages that function well. The text, pictures, and\ngraphical design of everyday graphics are, therefore, given the\nfinal design with great care and consideration.\nEveryday graphics may be both aesthetically attractive and\ndecorative. There are also examples of everyday graphics that\n245 are not successful. A label or package are often a part of a series:\na part of a carefully prepared \u201cwhole\u201d. Products from one com-\npany may be kept together with the help of a common logotype\nor symbol, and with similar graphical design for the choice of\ntypeface and size of type, the placing of texts, and the use of pic-\ntures, colours, and decorative patterns. The intention is that a\nspecific graphical profile will make it easier for the re-\nceiver/customer/reader to quickly and easily find articles and\nproducts from the same supplier.\nTempting to buy? Here is an example of an elegant and free\nand easy design from France (left), and an example of a less\nsuccessful design from Belgium (right).\nThe illustration above contains a life-size example of an\nelegant and free and easy design of a lid on an individual por-\ntion of strawberry jam from a French company. The semicircu-\nlar text contains information in several languages on the con-\ntents. The three strawberries are printed in colours that look\n\u201cwarmed by the sun\u201d and naturally yellow-orange-red. There is\n246 no doubt about the contents or about the trademark. Compare\nwith the life-size example of a less successful design of a lid on\nan individual portion of strawberry jam, from a Belgian com-\npany. Here the message \u201cstrawberry jam\u201d is clear, but the ber-\nries do not look appetizing enough. The colours are not success-\nful and the trademark is very dominating.\nText, pictures, and background\nWithin a given area \u2013 such as a page in a book, a poster, or a\nlabel \u2013 the designer may distribute text, picture, and back-\nground (margins, space, and patterns and designs without any\nsignificant picture elements). A typical page in a telephone di-\nrectory is almost filled with text. There are no pictures, and the\nmargins are narrow. Here, the text may cover 90 percent of the\npage. In dictionaries the text covers 75-80 percent, and in spe-\ncialist books and factual study books the text often covers 50-60\npercent of the page. In pure literature and children\u2019s books, the\ntext area is often even smaller than that. When a picture covers\nthe entire page, there is no space for text or margins. The third\nextreme is an empty page.\nIn order to easily compare the relationship between text\narea, picture area, and background area in different graphical\nverbal and visual messages, I have developed a \u201cverbal and\nvisual area diagram\u201d. This diagram has three axes: text area,\npicture area, and background area. The three axes are graded\nfrom zero to 100 percent. The text and picture axis have a com-\nmon starting-point, and there is a right angel (90 degrees) be-\ntween them. The background axis is situated at a 45-degree an-\ngel to both the other axis, and it is graded from the outside to-\nwards the starting point of the other axis. Consequently, where\n247 the text and picture areas are zero, 100 percent is back-\nground/emptiness.\n100%\nText\n0%\narea\nBackground\narea\nPicture area\n100%\n0% 100%\nThis is the structure for the verbal and visual area diagram.\nThe three axes are graded from zero to 100 percent.\nVisual area diagrams for a fiction book without illustrations\n(green), and an illustrated book for children (red) may look\nlike these two diagrams.\n248 Here are the verbal and visual area diagrams on the mean\nvalues of four posters to the left (picture area 68%, text area\n15%, background area 17%), and on the mean values of four-\nteen lids on jam packages to the right (picture area 30%, text\narea 33%, background area 37%).\nThe areas for text, picture, and background have been cal-\nculated by putting a transparency with a grid over enlarged\ncopies (300 percent) of the everyday graphics, and over reduced\ncopies of some posters. By counting the number of squares for\neach category, the percentage distribution of text area, picture\narea, and background area is easily calculated. When text is\nprinted on a picture, the area is equally divided between the two\ncategories. Text logotypes are regarded as text. Symbols are re-\ngarded as pictures. Depending on the shape and size of the lids,\nthe number of squares varied between 180 and 270. For the\nposters, the number of squares varied between 345 and 450.\nConsequently, a single square always represents less than a per-\ncent of the area \u2013 often less than half a percent.\n249 In the artful posters exemplifying this chapter, the picture\narea strongly dominates the areas for both text and background.\nThis is shown in a very clear way in a verbal and visual area dia-\ngram. On the lids of the jam packages there is much more bal-\nance between the text area, picture area, and background area.\nArea diagrams on the mean values of the fourteen information\ngraphics products in this analysis show great correspondence\nwith a page in a book containing the same amount of text, pic-\ntures, and background.\nHowever, among the information graphics products that\nhave been studied, there are some examples with a similar dis-\ntribution of the area as on the posters. We may consider today\u2019s\neveryday graphics as a development of the posters from the turn\nof the last century. In several respects, the two groups have\nsimilar functions, and there are similarities in their designs. A\nreason for differences in the designs between the two groups\nmay be the great difference between the products to be \u201csold\u201d.\nCh\u00e9ret\u2019s advertising for aperitif, books, and foodstuff looks\nmore like today\u2019s everyday graphics than the posters in this\nstudy. Here, the division of the area is very similar to the French\npackage, \u201cConfiture de fraises\u201d. Everyday graphics usually have\na very good balance between text, picture, and background. It is\nprobably a good idea to employ this balance also in the produc-\ntion of other kinds of information graphics, as well as in the\nproduction of learning materials.\n250 Dubonnet Aperitif is a typical poster (116 x 83 cm) designed by\nJules Ch\u00e9ret, 1895. To the right is the verbal and visual area\ndiagram for this poster, (text area 25%, picture area 47%,\nbackground area 28%).\nHere is an everyday graphic printed directly on the lid on an\nindividual portion of jam from France. The verbal and visual\narea diagram is shown to the right (text area 33%, picture\narea 47%, background area 20%).\n251 References\nAbe Pittman, L. (2012). Typography & Feelings.
