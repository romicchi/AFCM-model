Ross and Elizabeth Robar\nMarch MMXXIII ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS\nJacobus A. Naud\u00e9 and Cynthia L. Miller-Naud\u00e9,\nGenerative Linguistics as a Theoretical Framework for\nthe Explanation of Problematic Constructions in\nBiblical Hebrew\nThis article provides a brief, historical overview of seven decades\nof generative linguistic theory, from its inception by Chomsky in\n1957 to the present day, with special emphasis on its emerging\nconcepts. The major contributions of the application of genera-\ntive linguistic theory to the identification and explication of prob-\nlematic constructions in Biblical Hebrew are illustrated. Finally,\nthe article describes the prospects for further research in Biblical\nHebrew using linguistics in general and generative linguistics in\nparticular through a programmatic approach to the meaning-\nmaking processes of the languages of the biblical text.\nKeywords: Pronominalisation, topicalisation, left dislocation,\nextraposition, quantification, negation\nRandall Buth, Functional Grammar and the\nPragmatics of Information Structure for Biblical\nLanguages\nFunctional grammars include pragmatic information within for-\nmal grammar. Information structure refers to how languages\nkeep track of the topics and introductory material of a text, and\nhow they present the salient main points of a text. There are\ndifferences between normal handling of topical material and Abstracts and Keywords xvii\nspecial marking of topical material. Likewise, there are default\nways of presenting the main points and specially marked ways.\nThe Functional Grammar of Simon Dik is helpful in pointing out\nconstituents that carry pragmatic marking through word order.\nThis facilitates reading for meaning in the biblical languages so\nthat readers may recognise special presentations of material in\ntext. The linking of sentences together in a text with marked\nTopics, recognising Focus constituents, some unit discontinuities\nin a text, and some rhetorical features in a text, can be described.\nFunctional Grammar describes how audiences may perceive\nthese features in various languages and process them rapidly.\nThis adds both to the accuracy and enjoyment of listening to a\ntext or reading it. Extensive application and illustration are pro-\nvided in Hebrew with additional application to Greek. Modern\nreaders of ancient languages, where normal processes of lan-\nguage internalisation may not have taken place, may receive a\nspecial benefit from considering the interactions of Functional\nGrammar and information structure.\nKeywords: Topic, Focus, Functional Grammar, word order,\nHebrew, Greek\nWilliam A. Ross, Cognitive Linguistic Theory and the\nBiblical Languages\nThis chapter introduces Cognitive Linguistic theory with special\nattention to its application to the study of the ancient languages\nof the Bible. Beginning with a brief survey of the historical back-\nground and origins of Cognitive Linguistics, this chapter then xviii Linguistic Theory and the Biblical Text\nidentifies four key theoretical commitments that unify an other-\nwise diverse approach. Subsequently, this chapter identifies six\nmajor concepts within Cognitive Linguistics\u2014image schemas,\nframe semantics, domains and conceptual metaphor, mental\nspaces and conceptual blending, prototypes and semantic exten-\nsion, and cognitive approaches to grammar\u2014explaining them in\nsome detail and demonstrating their application to biblical texts\nin either Greek or Hebrew. The chapter concludes with a discus-\nsion of the use of Cognitive Linguistics within biblical studies\nover the past few decades, highlighting recent applications and\nidentifying potential for future research.\nKeywords: Cognitive Linguistics, Greek, Hebrew, biblical lan-\nguages, biblical studies\nKaspars Ozoli\u0146\u0161, Historical Linguistics and the Biblical\nLanguages\nHistorical linguistics enjoys a venerable history among the many\nsubfields of linguistic study. Many of the tools employed in his-\ntorical linguistics, as well as some of its theoretical concepts, are\nwell-suited for biblical studies which engage in the ancient\nlanguages of the Bible. Knowledge about the kinds of language\nchange common to many of the world\u2019s languages can be useful\nas one type of evidence for the periodisation of biblical books.\nAdditionally, knowledge about the external linguistic influences\nthat shaped the biblical languages, as well as their prior histories\n(both Semitic and Indo-European), provides a helpful context for\nstudying many synchronic aspects of the texts of Scripture. Fur-\nthermore, text-critical judgments about the biblical text can be Abstracts and Keywords xix\nstrengthened when informed by knowledge of language change\nacross the manuscript tradition. In short, historical linguistics\noffers a number of unique insights for biblical scholars engaging\nin the study of the biblical languages.\nKeywords: Historical linguistics, diachronic, sound change, anal-\nogy, Indo-European, Semitic\nWillem Th. van Peursen, Computational Linguistic\nAnalysis of the Biblical Text\nThis chapter discusses the various ways in which computational\nlinguistics has been applied to biblical languages. It describes the\ndevelopment that started in the 1970s and 1980s with the first\nattempts in text representation and that continued with the cre-\nation of morphological and syntactic databases. Until the early\ntwenty-first century, most computational linguistic approaches\nconcerned rule-based linguistic analysis, which allowed for a\nsystematic and distributional analysis of biblical corpora. Since\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century, statistical approaches\nand machine learning have entered the field of biblical studies,\nalthough most of their applications to the Bible still have an\nexperimental character. Because of the various computational\napproaches that have emerged in the last decades, computational\nlinguistics is not one single theory, but rather an amalgam of\napproaches in a rapidly changing field. The relation with other\nlinguistic theories is complex, because the databases that are used\nin the computational analysis of the Bible are each rooted in\ndifferent linguistic theories. However, the various computational\napproaches have developed further in ways that are typical of xx Linguistic Theory and the Biblical Text\ncomputational corpus linguistics and that go beyond the linguis-\ntic theories underlying the annotations in the respective data-\nbases. Because of the large amount of data it can handle, com-\nputational linguistics provides valuable contributions to well-\nestablished fields in the study of the biblical languages, such as\northography or syntax. In addition, more advanced computation-\nal techniques, such as author clustering and text-classification,\nprovide new ways to approach long-standing problems such as\nsource-critical questions and genre distinctions. The application\nof computational linguistics to the biblical languages also touches\nupon fundamental questions about the interpretation of the Bible,\nbecause it blurs the traditional distinction between the sciences,\nconceived of as a mode of scholarship involving calculation and\npattern recognition, and the humanities, understood as a herme-\nneutic and critical mode of scholarship.\nKeywords: Computational linguistics, databases, syntax, trans-\nparency and reproducibility\nSophia L. Pitcher, Emerging from Silos of Analysis: A\nComplexity Theory Approach to the Study of Biblical\nTexts\nThis chapter surveys a Complexity Theory (CT) approach applied\nin five areas of biblical scholarship: diachrony, language ped-\nagogy, translation theory, syntax, and the Masoretic accents of\nthe Hebrew Bible. A complexity approach to linguistic theory\nforemostly recognises that language is a complex system and\naccordingly aims to situate a particular subject of study within a\ncontext that more closely resembles the complex interactions of Abstracts and Keywords xxi\nvarious dimensions of the system. CT is different from the other\nlinguistic theories presented in this volume in that it functions as\na metatheory. An understanding of the general principles of CT\ncan mitigate an inclination towards reductionist analysis and\nenable researchers to perceive fundamental properties and inter-\nactions of language phenomena that remain opaque to traditional\ntheoretical frameworks. As a metatheory, CT can provide a help-\nful perspective for the scholar or practitioner, transforming an\nanalysis via the questions it raises, the manner in which answers\nto these questions are pursued, and the conclusions ultimately\ndrawn. A brief overview of CT is provided with particular atten-\ntion to its application in the field of linguistics.\nKeywords: Complexity Theory, complex systems, linguistics,\nbiblical studies  INTRODUCTION\nElizabeth Robar\nScholarship on biblical languages is rooted in Classical Philology,\nbut Classical Philology has all but disappeared after birthing the\nfull range of humanities. The linguistics portion of philology has\ndeveloped several separate schools of linguistic thought, each of\nwhich offers a different perspective on how to analyse and\nexplain language. These different perspectives heavily influence\nhow we interpret the biblical text, which places a burden on the\nstudent and scholar not to remain ignorant about formative\ninfluences behind their own interpretations.\nThis edited volume presents the most important linguistic\ntheories in use today for interpreting the biblical languages, with\nthe intent of educating the student and scholar about what lies\nbehind many of their favourite language tools and resources. All\ntoo often, both student and scholar are unaware of the prior theo-\nretical commitments that drive many of the conclusions in these\nresources.\nAll work is, of necessity, done within a theoretical frame-\nwork of some kind. When that framework remains unexamined\nand unarticulated, it becomes a liability for interpretations based\non it. Ignorance of theoretical frameworks has become perva-\nsive and problematic enough, even in academic circles, that one\n\u00a92023 Elizabeth Robar, CC BY-NC 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358.07 2 Robar\nresponse is to require that linguistic proposals submitted for con-\nferences express \u2018a well-articulated linguistic method\u2019 in order to\neven be considered for acceptance (Society of Biblical Literature,\nLinguistics and Biblical Hebrew section).\nThis volume is a response to the need for students and\nscholars first to understand the various theories on offer, in order\nto be able to decide which theoretical framework is most suitable\nfor their own work. The chapters fall into three categories:\n1. Distinct linguistic theories, each with their own presuppo-\nsitions, purpose and methods. Scholars with a strong theo-\nretical background will often identify with one of these in\nparticular.\na. Generative linguistics (Chapter 2)\nb. Functional Grammar (Chapter 3)\nc. Cognitive Linguistics (Chapter 4)\nd. Historical linguistics (Chapter 5)\n2. Practical implementation of a theory, which has been\napplied to each of the above theories.\na. Computational linguistic analysis (Chapter 6)\n3. Umbrella theory that seeks to enable interaction between\ntheories, as a practical form of interdisciplinarity.\na. Complexity Theory (Chapter 7)\nSignificant areas of linguistic theory not covered in this\nvolume include structuralism and typological linguistics. The\ninfluence of these theories on biblical studies has either been\nindirect or very localised. Chapter 3 (Ross) provides an overview\nof structuralism as it bears on generative linguistics and Cogni-\ntive Linguistics. Typological linguistics, in connection to Biblical Introduction 3\nHebrew, is best known from John Cook\u2019s application of Bybee,\nPerkins, and Pagliuca (1994) in his Time and the Hebrew Verb\n(2012).\nIt should be noted that Chapter 4 is entitled Computational\nLinguistic Analysis rather than Computational Linguistics, because,\nas van Peursen writes, application of computational linguistics\nhas been largely restricted to syntactic databases of the biblical\ntext, along with a few dissertations on machine learning. The\nterm computational linguistics now tends to refer to Natural Lan-\nguage Processing (NLP) and machine learning, which are only in\ntheir infancy within biblical studies.\nThese linguistic theories differ in specific areas. One such\narea is how the nature of language itself is understood. Ferdinand\nde Saussure famously distinguished between la parole (spoken\nlanguage, with all the messiness of everyday interaction) and la\nlangue (the abstract system of language, as found in edited writ-\ning). Spoken language may be broadened to communication,\nwhether largely linguistic (Functional Grammar) or embodied\nand extending far beyond language (Cognitive Linguistics). For-\nmal (written) language is understood as grammatical (following\nthe rules) or ungrammatical (generative linguistics).\nThe nature of grammar flows from the understanding of\nlanguage: it can be inherently meaningful, a key to interpreting\ncommunication; or it can be a formal system explicating the\nabstract linguistic system. Theories approaching language as an\nabstract system have different purposes for their grammatical\nanalysis: the diachronic (historical) development of language 4 Robar\n(historical linguistics), the synchronic reality (e.g., structural-\nism), or the delimitation of acceptable (\u2018grammatical\u2019) construc-\ntions (e.g., generative linguistics).\nWhile not a focus of this volume, the extent of language\nanalysed has also been a significant distinguishing factor between\ntheories: whether a theory addresses grammar of linguistic levels\nat the sentence and below (e.g., structuralism, generative linguis-\ntics), or linguistic levels above the sentence (e.g., discourse analy-\nsis), or conceptual representations beyond language itself (e.g.,\nCognitive Linguistics).\nA final distinction between these theories is the priority\nthey accord to various linguistic levels: morphology (e.g., struc-\nturalism and historical linguistics), semantics (e.g., Cognitive Lin-\nguistics), syntax (e.g., generative linguistics), and pragmatics\n(e.g., Functional Grammar).\nComplexity Theory stands out for not taking an explicit\nstance on any of these questions, precisely because its purpose is\nto enable different systems to interact while preserving their own\ninternal composition. For perhaps each of the theories, theoreti-\ncal clarity, in the form of dogmatic claims, has often come at the\ncost of explanatory adequacy, when confronted with the com-\nplexity of real language and texts. No one theory can explain\neverything. Complexity Theory aims to create space for each sep-\narate theory both to operate on its own and to interact with other\ntheories.\nEach chapter follows the same format: history and develop-\nment of the theory; key theoretical commitments and major\nconcepts; use and contributions in biblical studies to date; and Introduction 5\nprospects for further study, application, and collaboration. Each\nchapter concludes with both a handful of suggestions for next\nreading (handbooks, introductions, and foundational texts) as\nwell as a full bibliography for fuller research. Each chapter is\ntherefore self-contained and may be read on its own, but the par-\nallel structure should facilitate comparison and contrast between\ntheories, as the reader seeks to evaluate each theory.\nThe biblical text has come to us as written language, a\nreduced form of the original communication. The various linguis-\ntic theories have done much to illuminate that text and that com-\nmunication. May this volume be one more step in furthering the\npursuit of studying the text for the sake of understanding.\nReferences\nBybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994.

GENERATIVE LINGUISTICS AS A\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE\nEXPLANATION OF PROBLEMATIC\nCONSTRUCTIONS IN BIBLICAL HEBREW1\nJacobus A. Naud\u00e9 and Cynthia L. Miller-Naud\u00e9\n1.0. Introduction\nDo linguistic theories, in general, and generative linguistics, in\nparticular, benefit the interpretation of a biblical text in any way\nand, if so, how? This is the question addressed in this chapter.\nIn the meaning-making process of textual interpretation,\nlinguistic knowledge provides interpreters of the text with\nknowledge of language structure, metalanguage, and methodol-\nogy through which they can describe and explain problematic\ninstances of language use in the text under consideration. The\n1 This work is based on research supported in part by the National\nResearch Foundation of South Africa (Jacobus A. Naud\u00e9 UID 85902 and\nCynthia L. Miller-Naud\u00e9 UID 95926).

Miller-Naud\u00e9, https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358.01\nCC BY-NC 4.0 Generative Linguistics 7\nprocess of linguistic inquiry proceeds by observation, description,\nand explanation of language use. Explanation of language use is\nthe stage at which linguists endeavour to establish the underlying\nrules that speakers internalise to construct and use sounds,\nwords, and sentences, as well as the ways in which meanings are\nassigned to these units of language in order to communicate\n(Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 2020, 15). By developing a consistent\nanalysis of the systematic regularities in the language of a text,\nlinguistics contributes to interpretation (Traugott and Pratt 1980,\n20). A linguistic reading that is sensitive to the grammatical,\nsociological, and psychological aspects of language (such as\nchoices of words and sentence types) possesses conventional\nreverberations and associations for readers (Fowler 1977, 4). We\nwill argue that the linguistic knowledge contributed by linguistic\ntheories, in particular generative linguistics, is indispensable for\nthe text interpretation process.\n2.0. Historical Development and Concepts of\nGenerative Linguistics\n2.1. Goal of the Generative Enterprise\nNoam Chomsky (1928\u2013), Institute Professor Emeritus in the\nDepartment of Linguistics and Philosophy at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology, introduced generative grammar with his\nbook Syntactic Structures (1957). The main purpose of the genera-\ntive enterprise is to suggest an explanatory hypothesis concerning\nthe nature of language and ultimately human thought (Chomsky\n1982a, 5\u201358; 2019, 265\u201366). Accordingly, the object of linguistic 8 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nstudy from a generative point of view is the knowledge that\nnative speakers possess that enables them to produce and under-\nstand sentences. A generative grammar is thus an analysis of the\nmental mechanisms that enumerate all the grammatical sen-\ntences of a language\u2014and only those that are grammatical\u2014and\nassign to each an appropriate structural description (Chomsky\n1965, 4\u20135). Chomsky (1986a, 3; 1991a, 6) formulated three basic\nquestions that frame this inquiry: (1) what constitutes knowledge\nof language, (2) how is such knowledge acquired, and (3) how is\nsuch knowledge put to use?\nConcerning the first question, the internalised knowledge\nof speakers is called \u2018language competence\u2019 (Chomsky 1965, 3\u2013\n9). It refers to the knowledge of finite sounds and rules of pho-\nnology, finite words and rules for the formation of meaningful\nwords, as well as finite rules for the production of an infinite\nnumber of sentences and their meanings. The notion of language\nas generative (i.e., language as a system that provides for infinite\nuse of finite means) lies at the heart of generative linguistics and\nprovides a solution to Von Humboldt\u2019s problem of what consti-\ntutes knowledge of language (Chomsky 1991a, 6\u201314).\nThe second problem is known as \u2018Plato\u2019s problem\u2019: how is\nit possible that children acquire language so early, effortlessly,\nand with so little experience with language data, in comparison\nto the acquisition of number systems and writing systems, which\ntake many years to learn? Furthermore, how is this rich system\nof language knowledge shared (Chomsky 1986a, 51\u2013220; 1991a,\n15\u201317)? Chomsky proposed that the innate component of the lan-\nguage faculty as represented in the mind/brain makes early child Generative Linguistics 9\nlanguage acquisition effortless. This biologically innate language\nfaculty (or Universal Grammar, UG) helps children to make sense\nof the language data to which they are exposed and to build an\ninternal grammar (I[nternal]-language; Chomsky 1986a, 21\u201324),\nwhich is used to produce the sentences the children utter\n(E[xternal]-language; Chomsky 1986a, 19\u201321).\nThe third question concerns the individual\u2019s use of lan-\nguage knowledge in acts of communication\u2014namely speech pro-\nduction and speech perception\u2014which Chomsky (1965, 10\u201315)\ncalled \u2018language performance\u2019. In this regard, Descartes and his\nfollowers made three observations (Chomsky 1972a, 5\u201314).\nFirstly, normal use of language is innovative; utterances are\nmostly new and not a repetition or even similar in pattern to\nprevious utterances. This is similar to Chomsky\u2019s (1957, 15) view\nthat a speaker is able to understand/interpret and produce an\ninfinite number of new, previously unheard utterances. Secondly,\nhumans do not have to communicate in response to stimuli or\ninstinct; humans are free to think and express themselves at will.\nThis is similar to Chomsky\u2019s (2002 [1966], 52\u201362) view that\nnormal use of language is free from stimulus control and can\ntherefore serve as an instrument of thought and self-expression.\nThirdly, the normal use of language is coherent and appropriate\nto the situation. This creative aspect of language use provides an\nanswer to Descartes\u2019s problem of how knowledge of language is\nput to use (Chomsky 2002 [1966], 51\u201371; 1991a, 15\u201319). One\ncan explain the complex creative linguistic behaviour of humans\nonly by concluding that it is determined by intrinsic properties\nof mental organisation. This happens as an internal grammar 10 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\n(I-language) generates structural descriptions or representations\nthat specify the linguistic elements for each expression (E-\nlanguage; Chomsky 1964c, 7\u20139; 2002 [1966], 72\u201393; 1991a, 17\u2013\n20).\nThe goal of generative linguistics is therefore \u201cto construct\na formalized general theory of linguistic structure\u201d to account for\nthese states of affairs and provide solutions for many other\nrelated problems for which the theory was not actually designed\n(Chomsky 1957, 5). To achieve this goal, focus is specifically on\n\u201csyntactic structure, both in the broad sense (as opposed to\nsemantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed to phonemics and\nmorphology)\u201d (Chomsky 1957, 5). Although generative linguists\nuse deduction and intuition to construct theories of language\nstructure, they test them against actual language data.\n2.2. Autonomy of Syntax\nChomsky\u2019s Syntactic Structures (1957) introduced the theoretical\nstudy of syntax. To derive sentences, Chomsky (1957, 45\u201346)\nformalised a tripartite arrangement of grammar, consisting\nof phrase structure, transformational structure, and morpho-\nphonemics. The output of phrase structure is a sequence of mor-\nphemes, though not necessarily in the correct order. The rules of\nthe transformational structure may rearrange, add, or delete mor-\nphemes to yield a string of words. The morphophonemic rules\nconvert this string of words into a string of phonemes. In short,\nto encode dependencies between sentence parts (word order), a\nsystem of phrase structure rules produces basic sentences, while\ntransformational rules derive all other sentences from these basic Generative Linguistics 11\nsentences. For example, active sentences are considered basic,\nwhereas passive sentences are derived from active sentences\nby means of transformational rules (Chomsky 1957, 42\u201343).\nAccordingly, transformations must involve important semantic\nconsequences.\nAlthough Chomsky (1957, 13\u201317, 92\u2013105) considered the\nquestion of how the meaning of a sentence is related to its syn-\ntactic form, his conclusion was that grammar is \u201cbest formulated\nas a self-contained study independent of semantics\u201d (106). To\navoid misunderstanding of the nature of the relationship between\nsyntax and semantics, this conclusion must be understood in light\nof the following statement by Chomsky (1957, 102):\nWe can judge formal theories in terms of their ability to\nexplain and clarify a variety of facts about the way in\nwhich sentences are used and understood. In other words,\nwe should like the syntactic framework of the language\nthat is isolated and exhibited by the grammar to be able to\nsupport semantic description, and we shall naturally rate\nmore highly a theory of formal structure that leads to\ngrammars that meet this requirement more fully.\nInstead of viewing the emergence of the theory of linguistic\nstructure as a succession of different models with numerous mod-\nifications, it must rather be viewed as a single model that is con-\ntinually subject to critical assessments in terms of new questions\nand insights, and that is accordingly modified (Van Riemsdijk\nand Williams 1986, 171). The various terms used to designate the\nmodel are used to refer to the respective periods in the history of\ngenerative linguistics over nearly seven decades. The following\nsections provide an overview of these respective periods. 12 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\n2.3. Standard Theory Model\nThe success of a linguistic theory is tested for adequacy by the\ndegree to which the structures generated by the syntactic rules\nform a suitable basis for semantic interpretation. In 1962,\nChomsky (1964a, 936; 1964b, 77; 1964c, 51) considered the\nincorporation of semantics into generative grammar:\nIn general, as syntactic description becomes deeper, what\nappear to be semantic questions fall increasingly within its\nscope; and it is not entirely obvious whether or where one\ncan draw a natural bound between grammar and \u2018logical\ngrammar\u2019, in the sense of Wittgenstein and the Oxford\nphilosophers. Nevertheless, it seems clear that explanatory\nadequacy for descriptive semantics requires, beyond this,\nthe development of an independent semantic theory\n(analogous, perhaps, to the theory of universal phonetics\nas mentioned below) that deals with questions of a kind\nthat can scarcely be coherently formulated today, in\nparticular, with the question: what are the substantive and\nformal constraints on systems of concepts that are con-\nstructed by humans on the basis of presented data?\nThis role of semantics was addressed by Katz and Fodor (1963)\nand Katz and Postal (1964; see Chomsky 1964c, 14). In the same\nway that Chomsky (1957) wanted to make explicit what the\nspeaker knows of syntactic structure, they wanted to make\nexplicit what the speaker knows of the meanings of words and\nsentences. These proposals led to the incorporation of semantics\ninto the model known as the Standard Theory (ST; Chomsky\n1969, 5), which was described by Chomsky (1965, 132\u201336).\nThe ST exhibits a triangular organisation containing a\nsyntactic component and two interpretive components, one Generative Linguistics 13\nphonological and one semantic (Chomsky 1964c, 9\u201310; 1965,\n15\u201318; Katz and Postal 1964, 161). Chomsky (1965, 135) puts\nforward the hypothesis that semantic interpretation is made only\nin the underlying or deep structure. Specifically, the syntactic\ncomponent consists of a base sub-component and a transforma-\ntional sub-component (Chomsky 1965, 106\u201311, 141). The former\ngenerates a deep structure where words from the lexicon are\ninserted into a preterminal string of dummy elements of the\ncategorial part (Chomsky 1965, 120), which is submitted to the\nsemantic component for semantic interpretation. Without chang-\ning meaning, the transformational sub-component maps deep\nstructure into surface structure by reordering elements (Chomsky\n1965, 123\u201324), which enter the phonological component for\nphonetic interpretation by the rules for pronunciation (Chomsky\n1965, 135).\nThe interpretive components play no part in the recursive\ngeneration of sentence structures (Chomsky 1965, 141). Syntax\nis self-contained (see Chomsky 1965, 226 n. 15). For the inter-\npretation of a sentence, the syntactic component of the grammar\nrelates a semantic interpretation of the underlying structure to a\nphonetic representation on surface level (Chomsky 1965, 136).\nChomsky (1965, v\u2013vi) clearly states that this hypothesis is merely\ntentative and emerging.\n2.4. Generative Semantics\nKatz and Postal (1964, 71) argued that semantic interpre-\ntations are uniquely assigned to deep structures, a viewpoint\nalso reflected in the ST. This requirement means that the 14 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\ntransformational sub-component of the syntactic component does\nnot contribute in any way to semantic interpretation. \u201cTrans-\nformations do not affect meaning\u201d became known as the Katz-\nPostal Hypothesis (Chomsky 1965, 132, 135; 1977a, 140\u201343).\nKatz and Postal (1964, 72\u2013156) defend their hypothesis by re-\nexamining apparent counterexamples, for example, the deriva-\ntions of active/passive, negatives, imperatives, questions, etc.,\nand claim that \u201ctheir present formulation is not entirely ade-\nquate\u201d (71). Unsurprisingly, this model, known as \u2018interpretive\nsemantics\u2019 (Chomsky 1977a, 145), was soon challenged, espe-\ncially because of the exclusive link it postulated between seman-\ntics and deep structure.\nIn his exposition of the ST, Chomsky (1965, 224 n. 9)\nalready expressed his doubts about the Katz-Postal Hypothesis.\nChomsky (1977a, 151) mentioned the critique of Ray Jackendoff\nas the first to show that surface structure plays a role in semantic\ninterpretation. Chomsky (1972a, 100\u201314) argued that this\nrestriction on the nature of transformations is too strong; there\nare cases where transformations have semantic effects. Both deep\nand surface structure enter into the determination of meaning:\ndeep structure inter alia for predication and modification, and\nsurface structure for focus, presupposition, topic and comment,\nthe scope of logical elements (including quantifiers), and pro-\nnominal reference, a view that eventually led to the Extended\nStandard Theory model (see \u00a72.5).\nGeorge Lakoff laid the foundations for the development of\nGenerative Semantics in his dissertation published in 1970.\nLakoff and others argued that, if the deep component were of a Generative Linguistics 15\nsemantic rather than a syntactic nature, and if the difference\nbetween the semantic component and the deep syntactic compo-\nnent were erased, meaning differences could all be expressed as\nan underlying semantic representation. Consequently, the inde-\npendent deep syntactic component of the ST would cease to exist\nas an independent level of description and become indistinguish-\nable from the semantic level. From 1966 until the early 1970s,\nthe theory of Generative Semantics was developed, which\nreplaced the base of the ST with an abstract semantic level from\nwhich meanings were mapped into surface structures by trans-\nformations according to a unilinear structure of input-output\nrelations (Lakoff 1968, 1\u201384; 1971, 232\u201396). This approach is\nknown as the transformationalist position (Chomsky 1972b, 17).\nChomsky argued that transformational derivation in\nGenerative Semantics cannot naturally capture structures that\nexhibit significant syntactic differences, when they are assigned\nidentical underlying structures (Chomsky 1966, 48\u201349; 1972b,\n11\u201361). Jackendoff (1972, xi) opted for the formulation of proper\nrules of semantic interpretation to account for semantic phenom-\nena and to leave the syntactic component as free of semantic\nintervention as it was in Syntactic Structures. Katz (1972; 1977)\ncontinued to pursue the basic approach to semantics as exposed\nin Katz and Fodor (1963).\nAlthough Generative Semantics was eventually unsuccess-\nful because of the failure to distinguish between syntactic and\nnon-syntactic properties of sentence structure, it served as a cata-\nlyst for the further study of semantics (Van Riemsdijk and\nWilliams 1986, 88). 16 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\n2.5. Extended Standard Theory Model\nIn 1972, Chomsky published a more refined theory of semantic\ninterpretation. Chomsky (1972b, 11\u2013202) described in three\nessays the shortcomings that arose within the ST, resulting in the\nemergence of the Extended Standard Theory (EST; Chomsky\n1970, 10). In EST, the semantic component does not operate\nsolely on the output of the deep syntactic component, but also on\nthe output of the transformational component (Chomsky 1972b,\n5). This constitutes the Chomskyan departure from the ST set out\nin Katz and Postal (1964) and Chomsky (1965). In EST, semantic\nrepresentation is shared between the underlying structure (for\nthematic and case structure) and the surface structure (for rules\nof anaphora and quantification; Chomsky 1972b, 62\u2013119). In\nother words, the semantic component relates both the deep struc-\nture and the surface structure to a semantic representation.\nHowever, the grammatical relations expressed in a sentence are\ninherent in the syntactic deep structure. A separate semantic\ncomponent with a purely interpretive role is still assumed\n(Chomsky 1972b, 120\u2013202).\nChomsky (1972b, 11\u201361) also extends grammatical theory\nto incorporate syntactic features, thus formulating the \u2018lexicalist\nposition\u2019. He also presents evidence that EST is to be preferred\nover Generative Semantics on methodological as well as empiri-\ncal grounds (62\u2013202).\n2.6. Revised Extended Standard Theory Model\nChomsky (1975a) proposed further theoretical refinements, in\nparticular the Revised Extended Standard Theory (REST), where Generative Linguistics 17\nsemantic representation appears only in the surface structure.\nThe syntactic and semantic properties of the deep structures of\nthe ST and the EST are dissociated (Chomsky 1975a, 81\u201382).\nChomsky (1975a, 82) also dropped the term \u2018deep structure\u2019,\nutilising instead \u2018initial phrase marker\u2019, but retaining the term\n\u2018surface structure\u2019 (see also Chomsky 1977a, 169\u201379). This theo-\nretical change was made possible by the introduction of \u2018traces\u2019\n(called \u2018copies\u2019 since 1995), which mark the original positions of\nmoved elements in the underlying structure (Chomsky 1975a,\n86\u2013103; 1977a, 165). As a result, the rules of thematic and case\nstructure were applied to surface structure, thereby simplifying\nthe semantic component (Chomsky 1975a, 116\u201318).\nAccordingly, derivations within the REST model are as\nfollows (Chomsky 1975a, 103\u20135; 1977a, 165). The rules of the\ncategorial component (i.e., the lexical categories) and the lexicon\nprovide initial phrase markers. The rules of the transformational\ncomponent convert the initial phrase markers to surface struc-\ntures (including traces), which undergo semantic interpretation\n(involving bound anaphora, scope, thematic relations, etc.) to\nconvert the surface structures into logical forms (Chomsky\n1977a, 165\u201366). For fuller representation of meaning, the gene-\nrated logical forms are subject to further interpretation by other\nsemantic rules that interact with other cognitive structures.\nThe picture which emerged with the REST model suggests\nthat the grammar consists of various autonomous components\n(syntax, phonology, semantics), which have their own rules and\ninteract with each other only at the relevant interface (Van\nRiemsdijk and Williams 1986, 174). In the description and 18 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nexplanation of a particular language, each of these components\nand their interrelations must come into its own.\nEnriched with idiosyncratic transformational rules, the\nmodel at this stage faced the problem of how to characterise the\ninitial state of the language faculty (to have explanatory ade-\nquacy) and show how it maps language experience to the final\nstate attained (to have descriptive adequacy). To achieve explan-\natory adequacy, a theory of the initial state can allow only limited\nvariation. This insight led to a refinement of generative grammar\nwith the shift towards the Principles-and-Parameters approach\n(Chomsky 1981a; 1991b, 417), discussed below, where the initial\nstate of language is represented as a system of innate formal\nprinciples with associated open parameters, the values of which\nare fixed by linguistic experience for each specific language.\n2.7. Principles-and-Parameters Approach\nSo far the emphasis was on the similarities between languages.\nThe question was how to account for the differences between\nlanguages. Chomsky realised that the apparent complexity and\nvariety of languages can be viewed as superficial, the result of\nminor changes in a fixed and invariant system. Accordingly, it is\npossible to attribute only limited variation to the innate language\nfaculty (or UG) so that explanatory adequacy can be achieved.\nIn a series of publications, Chomsky (1977b; 1977c; 1978;\n1980; Chomsky and Lasnik 1977) dismantled the rich idiosyn-\ncratic transformational rules of the previous models. The rethink-\ning of many problematic aspects of the theory of grammar during\nthis period is discussed in Chomsky (1982a, 61\u2013120). The process Generative Linguistics 19\nresulted in the Pisa Lectures (Chomsky 1981b), which are an\nexposition of the Principles-and-Parameters approach (Chomsky\n1991b, 417) or so-called Government-Binding theory\u2014the prin-\nciple of \u2018government\u2019 relates items to one another; the princi-\nple of \u2018binding\u2019 determines which nominals in a sentence are\nco-referential. Chomsky (1991b, 448 n. 1) depicted the name\nGovernment-Binding theory as \u201ca misleading term that should\nbe abandoned.\u201d The model consists of a subsystem of rules and\na subsystem of parameterised principles. Chomsky (1982b, 7)\nremarked:\nIn the course of this work, there has been a gradual shift\nof focus from the study of rule systems, which have\nincreasingly been regarded as impoverished (as we would\nhope to be the case) to the study of systems of principles,\nwhich appear to occupy a much more central position in\ndetermining the character and variety of possible human\nlanguages.\nAccording to Chomsky (1991b, 417), \u201ca language is not, then, a\nsystem of rules, but a set of specifications for parameters in an\ninvariant system of principles of Universal Grammar (UG).\u201d\nThe subsystem of rules is reduced as follows: the notions of\ndeep- and surface-structures have been renamed D-structure and\nS-structure, respectively, since their roles are similar but not\nidentical. The levels of D-structure and S-structure are mapped\nby the transformational operation of Move \u03b1 (\u2018move alpha\u2019),\nwhere \u03b1 is a variable, meaning that a structure may be altered\nby movement of one or more elements; independent principles\ndetermine what can move and where it can move (Chomsky\n1981b, 5). Semantic representation is replaced by the notion 20 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nLogical Form (LF) as a level of representation, which is a partial\nrepresentation of the structural meaning of a sentence. Quantifier\nscope, the scope of question-words, and reflexive interpretation\nare examples that are dealt with on this level. Similarly, the pho-\nnetic representation is replaced by Phonetic Form (PF; Chomsky\n1981b, 18).\nThe subsystem of universal principles consists of bounding\ntheory (subjacency), government theory, theta-theory (assign-\nment of thematic roles), binding theory (co-referentiality of\nnominals), Case theory (assignment of abstract Case), and control\ntheory (reference of abstract pronominals; Chomsky 1981b, 5\u20136).\nEach of these theories comprises a principle or set of principles.\nEach of the principles has a parameter which has to be set as\nplus/minus on the basis of language-specific evidence. Parame-\ntric settings account for variation across languages, as well as for\nlanguage acquisition (Hyams 1986). The rules of a specific lan-\nguage are the principles of UG as parameterised for that specific\nlanguage (Chomsky 1991b, 417).\nThe setting of parameters provides the opportunity for a\nnew comparative syntax to explain language variation histori-\ncally and cross-linguistically. An example is the null subject or\npro-drop parameter, which distinguishes languages that do not\nallow a subject pronoun to be omitted (e.g., English) and those\nthat do (e.g., Italian; Rizzi 1982, 117\u201384). Certain properties sys-\ntematically correlate with the null subject property, for example\nthat an overt subject can occupy a postverbal position (Chomsky\n1981b, 240\u201348). In \u00a73.2, the null subject or pro-drop parameter Generative Linguistics 21\nis used to explain the syntactic distribution of independent per-\nsonal pronouns in Biblical Hebrew.\nGenerative grammar, and specifically the Principles-and-\nParameters approach, is couched in traditional grammatical\nterminology. Lexical categories include N(oun), V(erb), A\n(adjective/adverb), and P(reposition); functional/grammatical\ncategories include D(eterminer), T(ense), Asp(ect), M(ood), and\nC (complementiser/coordinator). Whereas lexical categories are\nacquired, can be translated, borrowed, and have meaning, func-\ntional grammatical categories do not have lexical meaning, are\nrarely borrowed, and may be contracted or lack stress. All of\nthese categories project into phrases (i.e., groups of words that\nbelong together), which are named after their most important\npart, the head. Phrases may be formed from lexical categories\n(verb phrase, noun phrase, etc.) and functional/grammatical\ncategories (determiner phrase, tense phrase, etc.).\nFrom 1982 to 1991, Chomsky proposed numerous refine-\nments to the Principles-and-Parameters approach (see 1982b;\n1986a; 1986b; 1988; Chomsky and Lasnik 1993). The most\nimportant of these refinements (which directly influenced exis-\nting syntactic analyses of Biblical Hebrew syntax and have impli-\ncations for further analyses) concerns functional projections\n(Pollock 1989; Abney 1987; Rizzi 1997). These include the VP-\nInternal Subject Hypothesis, which proposes that the thematic\nposition of the subject is internal to the VP (verb phrase), as well\nas the Split INFL (Inflection) Hypothesis, which proposes that\nInflection be decomposed into two separate functional heads,\nAGR (Agreement) and T (Tense; Pollock 1989). These two 22 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nfunctional projections have implications for the analysis of the\ninfinitive in Biblical Hebrew as well as for verb agreement and\npro-drop (see \u00a7\u00a73.2, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.8). A third functional projec-\ntion is the DP (determiner phrase) Hypothesis, which proposes\nthat noun phrases are in fact projections of a functional head, the\ndeterminer (D; Abney 1987). This functional projection has\nimpli cations for the analysis of the quantifier \u05dc\u05db, which may\noccur inside or outside of the DP to produce different meanings\n(see \u00a73.6). A fourth innovation is the Split CP (complementiser\nphrase) Hypothesis, which concerns \u201cthe fine structure of the left\nperiphery\u201d (Rizzi 1997, 281). A central point of departure is that\nthe discourse-pragmatic orientation of sentences is expressed\nwithin the CP domain. Accordingly, the C (complementiser) head\nis divided into four heads, each with its own projection, namely,\nTopic, Focus, Force (overt morphological encoding for declara-\ntives, questions, relatives, etc.), and Finiteness (expresses a dis-\ntinction related to tense and other inflectional specifications).\nThis refinement accounts for at least the distribution of the\nwayyiq\u1e6dol/waw consecutive construction as well as for left\ndislocation and topicalisation in Biblical Hebrew (see \u00a73.3).\n2.8. Minimalist Programme\nConsiderations of conceptual naturalness that have some inde-\npendent plausibility, which the human language faculty should\nbe expected to satisfy\u2014such as simplicity, economy, symmetry,\nand nonredundancy (see Chomsky 1975b, 113\u201328; 1991b, 417\u2013\n54; 2019, 264\u201365)\u2014led to further refinements in the 1990s with\nthe Minimalist Programme, the most recent instantiation of Generative Linguistics 23\ngenerative syntax. Despite some differences, many of the con-\ncepts developed in the Principles-and-Parameters approach carry\nover to the Minimalist Programme and the challenge is how to\nintegrate them (e.g., V[erb]-movement).\nChomsky introduced the Minimalist Programme in three\npublications (1992; 1994; 1995). In the main source (Chomsky\n1995), the computational system of language (i.e., the syntactic\ncomponent) is assumed to contain only what is necessary to build\nrepresentations that connect meaning to sound (or signs or wri-\nting); these representations are the same for all languages. In\nother words, the computational system of language serves as\ninput to the semantic component, which maps (or converts) the\nsyntactic structure into a corresponding semantic representation\n(i.e., a representation of linguistic aspects of its meaning). The\nsemantic representation interfaces with systems of thought,\nnamely, the Conceptual-Intentional system (responsible for inter-\npretation and non-linguistic knowledge). The computational sys-\ntem of language serves also as input to the Phonetic Form (PF)\ncomponent, which maps the syntactic structure into a PF\nrepresentation (i.e., a representation that provides a phonetic\n\u2018spellout\u2019, or pronunciation, of sentences). The PF representation\ninterfaces with the Sensory-Motor system (responsible for exter-\nnalising the derivation in speech systems, i.e., providing spoken,\nbut also signed or written, representations). The Minimalist\nmodel for deriving a sentence involves making a selection from\nthe lexicon (which contains all the lexical items in a language as\nwell as their linguistic properties) and then using the compu-\ntational operation \u2018Merge\u2019 to bring these items together from 24 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nbottom to top. Merge includes what was previously referred to as\n\u2018move\u2019 (e.g., when the merging element is taken from inside the\nderivation and copied). Refinements of the Minimalist Programme\nfollowed (Chomsky 1998; 1999).\nDerivations and structural representations have become\nextremely bare in the Minimalist Programme. In recent years, the\nfocus has shifted from a rich UG to innate mechanisms that are\npart of more general cognitive principles of organic systems\n(Chomsky 2004; 2005; 2007; 2013; 2015; 2019):\na) Chomsky (2004; 2005) identifies the factors that are cru-\ncial in the development of language, namely, the previous two\nfactors\u2014UG and experience (the input of a specific language)\u2014\nand a new factor, principles of efficient computation (not specific\nto the language faculty), which include the Economy Principles.\nb) Chomsky (2007) follows Borer (1984), where parame-\nters are seen as choices of feature specifications as the child\nacquires a lexicon, the so-called Borer-Chomsky Conjecture (see\nBaker 2008, 156). The computational system of every language\nis identical, but the parametric choices are lexical and account\nfor the variety of languages, as well as, for example, the determi-\nnation of linear order.\nc) Representation by means of trees is common in genera-\ntive grammar, but they are no longer used in the Problems-of-\nProjection approach to phrase/clause structure, according to\nChomsky (2013; 2015). A derivation is not labelled when it is\nbuilt. The labelling is done when the syntax hands over its com-\nbined sets to the interfaces, the interaction between components\nof grammar. Generative Linguistics 25\nd) Chomsky (2019) reviews some foundational aspects of\nthe theory of structure building\u2014essentially, Merge and Label\u2014\nwhile still accounting for recursive structure, displacement, and\nreconstruction (as the main empirical goals of the Minimalist\nProgramme).\nTo summarise, Chomsky\u2019s vision of a fixed syntactic com-\nponent with cross-linguistic variation triggered by differences in\nthe lexicon continues as the most productive avenue of research\nin the Minimalist Programme, whose core assumption is that\ngrammars are minimally complex systems of optimal design with\nparameters set by features of lexical items. The main innate\nmechanism of UG is seen as Merge, an operation by which two\nconstituents are combined to form a single larger constituent\n(e.g., a complement merges first with its head and then the spec-\nifier of the head is merged to this complex). In other words, a\nderivation starts with a selection from the lexicon and then\nmerges these elements from bottom to top. The derivation pro-\nceeds as follows: a verb phrase (VP), which includes the verb with\nits aspectual information and the arguments with their thematic\nroles; a tense phrase (TP), which connects the VP to information\non finiteness, tense, agreement, and case; a complementiser\nphrase (CP), which connects the TP to pragmatic information\n(mood, topic, focus) or to another clause. Movement of constitu-\nents may include movement of topic, focus, and wh-elements\n(that is, a question/interrogative word or relative item, such as\nwhat, who, which, when, why, how) as well as head-movement of\nthe verb (V) and tense (T). 26 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nThe most productive work using generative grammar to\nexplain syntactic constructions in Biblical Hebrew has been done\nin terms of the Principles-and-Parameters approach and the\nrefinements in the Minimalist Programme. An overview of these\ncontributions will be provided in the following section.\n3.0. Contributions of Generative Linguistics to\nBiblical Hebrew\n3.1. Introduction\nAs is clear from the overview of the development of Chomskyan\ngenerative linguistics in the preceding section, the focus has been\non the syntactic structure of language. For this reason, the exam-\nples selected for discussion in this section relate primarily to syn-\ntax. The focus on syntax, however, should not detract from the\nfact that generative linguistics has developed and contributed to\nother linguistic subdisciplines (e.g., phonology, morphology,\nsemantics, pragmatics), which have also benefitted Biblical\nHebrew.2\n2 These linguistic subdisciplines include: phonology and morphology\n(e.g., Prince 1975; Rappaport 1984; McCarthy 1985 [1979]; Malone\n1993; Dresher 1994; Churchyard 1999; Coetzee 1999; DeCaen 2003;\nDresher 2009a; 2009b; Himmelreich and Bat-El Foux 2021);\nphonological aspects of the Masoretic accentual system (e.g., Dresher\n1994; DeCaen and Dresher 2021; Pitcher 2021); and the morphology,\nsyntax, and semantics/pragmatics of the Biblical Hebrew verbal system\nand verb phrase (e.g., DeCaen 1995; Hatav 1997; DeCaen 1999;\nHarbour 1999; Pereltsvaig 2002; Hatav 2004; 2006; Holmstedt 2009; Generative Linguistics 27\n3.2. Null Subjects, Constituent Order, and the\nMeaning-Making of Independent Pronouns\nAn important typological classification based on the Principles-\nand-Parameters approach concerns the observation that lan-\nguages can be divided into those with grammatically optional sub-\njects (i.e., null subject languages or pro-drop languages) like\nHebrew and those with obligatory subjects (i.e., non-null subject\nlanguages or non-pro-drop languages) like English. In this regard,\nChomsky (1981b, 65) introduced the \u2018Avoid Pronoun Principle\u2019,\nwhich imposes the choice of a null subject over an overt subject\npronoun where possible. The availability of null subjects in\nHebrew correlates with the inflectional richness of agreement on\nthe finite verb form (Borer 1989). Naud\u00e9 (1991a; 1993b; 1994a;\n1994b) demonstrates the specific aspects of null subjects for BH\nand Qumran Hebrew, where the qa\u1e6dal/perfect, yiq\u1e6dol/imperfect,\nwayyiq\u1e6dol, and w\u0259qa\u1e6dal verb forms allow null subjects. Subject\npronouns that are used with null subject verb forms can be\nutilised only as subject topics (see \u00a73.3 below on topicalisation\nand the differences between Biblical Hebrew and Qumran\nHebrew in this regard). By contrast, participles functioning as the\npredicate in clauses do not allow null subjects. As a result, an\novert subject with a participial predicate, as in (1), is not\n\u2018marked\u2019 for topic or focus; it is neutral because an overt subject\nis grammatically required:\nHatav 2011; 2017; 2020; Boulet 2021; Cowper and DeCaen 2021;\nDoron 2021; Grasso 2021; Hatav 2021). 28 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\n(1) \u05dd \u05d9\u05b4\u05e8\u05b8\u05e6\u05b0\u05de\u05b4 \u05da\u05b0\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea\u05d1\u05b0 \u05d0\u05e6\u05b5\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d0\u05b2 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d9\u05b0\u05dc\u05bc\u05b7\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05ea\u05b9 \u05e6\u05d7\u05b2\u05db\u05bc\u05b7\n\u2018Towards midnight I will go out in the midst of the\nEgyptians.\u2019 (Exod. 11.4)\nThe \u2018Avoid Pronoun Principle\u2019 of the Principles-and-\nParameters approach and the Economy Principles of the Mini-\nmalist Programme explain the distribution of independent sub-\nject pronouns as opposed to null subjects in BH in a principled\nsyntactic way for the first time. With the qa\u1e6dal/perfect and yiq\u1e6dol/\nimperfect, the subject pronouns as topics appear only in pre-\nverbal position, but with wayyiq\u1e6dol and w\u0259qa\u1e6dal verb forms they\noccur only in postverbal position. In the following section, we\ndemonstrate that there are syntactic mechanisms that explain\nthis asymmetry.\nGovernment and Binding also provides insight into the syn-\ntax of BH participial forms. For example, the structure of BH\nallows the use of participles in attributive constructions while\nmaintaining the verbal characteristics of the verbal form (i.e., its\nverbal valency; e.g., Num. 13.32 , \u05e5\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d4\u05bc\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b9 \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u05dc \u05b8 \u05d4\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e2\u05b8 \u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05e5\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8\n\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05b4 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05d9\u05d1\u05b6 \u05e9\u05b0 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 \u05ea\u05dc\u05b6\u05db\u05b6\u05d0\u05b9 \u2018 the land which we crossed into it to explore it is\na land eating its inhabitants\u2019). English, in contrast, does not allow\nattributive participial constructions, but requires that a relative\nclause be used.\n3.3. Non-Canonical Constituent Order and Meaning-\nMaking at Sentence Edges\nFrom its conception, one of the central concerns of generative\nlinguistics has been to characterise the positions in which nom-\ninal elements can appear in a specific language, that is, word\norder (both canonical and non-canonical positions). In early Generative Linguistics 29\nforms of generative linguistics, this was achieved by a transfor-\nmation (see \u00a72.7) in Principles-and-Parameters and by \u2018Merge\u2019 in\nthe Minimalist Programme, which also entails movement. These\ntheoretical advances made it possible to formally identify and\ndifferentiate the constituents that occur at the edges of sentences,\na necessary prerequisite for determining what each construction\ncontributes to meaning.3\nA syntactic construction involving constituents moved to\nnon-canonical positions at the initial sentence periphery is topi-\ncalisation. This construction was described in Naud\u00e9 (1994a) as\ninvolving movement to the preverbal topic position:\n(2) \u05d5 \u05e0\u05ea\u05b5 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d7\u05d0\u05b2 \u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05c2\u05b6 \u05d4\u05e9\u05c2\u05b6 \u05e2\u05b2 \u05d9\u05b7 \u05d4\u05e0\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d6\u05db\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\n\u2018Like a whore should he treat our sister ?\u2019 (Gen.\nlike a whore\n34.31)\nIn this example, the topicalised constituent (underlined) is a\nprepositional phrase that has been moved to the very beginning\nof the sentence from its normal position at the end of the sen-\ntence. A zero trace (or copy) marks the location where the con-\nstituent originally occurred in the sentence (indicated by sub-\nscripted type; see \u00a72.6 and \u00a73.8). As indicated in the previous\nsection, the qa\u1e6dal/perfect and yiq\u1e6dol/imperfect verbal forms in BH\nand Qumran Hebrew allow an independent subject pronoun as a\nsubject topic before these verbal forms, but not after them\n(Naud\u00e9 2001).\nNaud\u00e9 (1996a, 181) demonstrates that when the verb is\none of the so-called consecutive verb forms in BH, this topic\n3 Five of these six edge-constructions in BH were treated together for\nthe first time from a generative perspective in Holmstedt (2014). 30 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nposition is not preverbal but postverbal. Independent pronouns\nthat occur with consecutive verbs in BH sentences are still subject\ntopics, even though they occur postverbally:\n(3) \u05d0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d4\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d4\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05bc\u05b7 \u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05d1 \u05b8 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d4\u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b7\u05d9\u05b0 \u05ea\u05d0\u05b5 \u05de\u05b5 \u05d5\u05bc \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b4 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d8 \u05ea\u05d0\u05b5 \u05de\u05b5 \u05d5\u05bc \u05d9\u05d3\u05bc\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d7\u05b6\u05de\u05b5 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d2\u05bc\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05ea\u05d0\u05b5 \u05de\u05b5 \u05d7\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d5\u05b9\u05e7 \u05dc\u05b8\n\u05dc \u05d1\u05b6\u05d1\u05b8\u05de\u05b4 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05d1\u05b8 \u05be\u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8 \u05e0\u05b0\u05e4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05e6\u05b0\u05be\u05df\u05d1\u05b6 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8 \u05e9\u05b4 \u05d0\u05b9\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05b5 \u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05d1\u05b8 \u05d5\u05bc\n\u2018Take from the exiled community, from Heldai, Tobijah,\nand Jedaiah, who have come from Babylon\u2014and (you) will\ngo, you, proceed on that day\u2014you will go to the house of\nJosiah son of Zephaniah.\u2019 (Zech. 6.10)\nNaud\u00e9 (1996a) argues that the sentence-initial position of the\nconsecutive verb forms is the result of obligatory verb movement\n(\u2018verb raising\u2019 in generative grammar). This parameter occurs in\nBH, but not in later forms of Hebrew (e.g., Qumran Hebrew and\nMishnaic Hebrew) or Biblical Aramaic. As a result, consecutive\nverb forms in Qumran Hebrew, for example, are not attested with\nthe independent subject pronoun following the verb. Generative\ngrammar thus provides a principled means to distinguish the\nappearance and absence of independent subject pronouns with\nfinite, pro-drop verbs. It also assists in identifying the locus of\nboth language difference and language change (see further \u00a73.9\nbelow).\nThe second construction, left dislocation (identified in\nNaud\u00e9 1990), involves a constituent that occurs outside of the\nsentence (indicated by double underlining) and has a resumptive\nelement that occurs within the sentence (indicated by under-\nlining and bold type):\n(4) \u05d4\u05bc\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05de \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 \u05d3\u05e2\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d3\u05dc\u05b6 \u05d9\u05b8 \u05d4\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4\u05b8\u05be\u05d0\u05b9 \u05dc \u05dc\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05e9\u05b8 \u05be\u05ea\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7 \u05dc\u05db\u05bc\u05b7\u05d9\u05de\u05b4 \u05dc\u05b0\u05d5\u05bc\n\u2018To Michal daughter of Saul, there was to her no child (i.e., she\nhad no child) until the day of her death.\u2019 (2 Sam. 6.23) Generative Linguistics 31\nIn this example, the resumptive element occurs in situ, that is, in\nthe normal position of the constituent in the sentence. It is also\npossible for the resumptive element itself to be in a preverbal\ntopic position so that it occurs at the beginning of the sentence\nproper:\n(5) \u05d4\u05d3\u05b8\u05d1\u05b5\u05db\u05b8\u05d0\u05b4 \u05dd\u05de\u05b8 \u05e2\u05b4 \u05ea\u05b0 \u05e8\u05b0\u05de\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05ea\u05d5\u05b9\u05d4\u05de\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05d4\u05b8\u05be\u05dd\u05e2\u05b4\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018...and among the slave girls that you speak of, among\nthem I will be honoured .\u2019 (2 Sam. 6.22)\namong them\nIn other words, the example exhibits both left dislocation of a\nconstituent and its resumption in the matrix sentence, and also\ntopicalisation of the resumptive element within the matrix sen-\ntence. Because topicalisation and left dislocation may occur in\nthe same sentence, they must be distinct constructions. Analyses\nthat indiscriminately merge the two constructions into \u2018fronting\u2019\n(or casus pendens) obscure the distinctive features and thus the\nmeanings of the constructions.\nA third construction is like topicalisation in having no\nresumptive element within the sentence, although a constituent\napparently occurs outside of the left edge of the sentence. Naud\u00e9\n(1990, 124; see also 1999), who first identified this construction,\nreferred to it as a variety of topicalisation. Holmstedt (2014)\nrefers to it as \u2018heavy topic fronting\u2019.

In addition to the heavy topicalisation\nconstruction discussed above, Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2021)\nidentify five kinds of left dislocations, namely: clitic left disloca-\ntion, where a dislocated constituent exhibits case agreement with\nits resumptive (11); hanging topic, where the dislocated constitu-\nent is always a noun phrase, but the resumptive within the matrix 34 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nsentence may bear any grammatical relation to the predication\n(12); left dislocation with deictic resumptive which is corefer-\nential with the dislocated constituent (13); left dislocation with\nindependent pronoun resumptive (14); and left dislocation with\na noun phrase resumptive (15).\n(11) \u05dd\u05d9\u05ea\u05b4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05b8 \u05e0\u05b0 \u05ea\u05b0 \u05d0\u05bc\u05b7 \u05da\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4 \u05ea\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u05e2\u05b2 \u05d5\u05b9\u05ea\u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d5 \u05b0 \u05da\u05b0\u05ea\u05b5 \u05de\u05b8 \u05d6\u05b4\u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6\n\u2018Your wickedness and your abominations, you bear them\u2019\n(Ezek. 16.58)\n(12) \u05dd\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0 \u05d4\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b7 \u05df\u05d9\u05de\u05b4 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d5 \u05b0 \u05df\u05d5\u05b9\u05e4\u05e6\u05b8\n\u2018North and south, you created them\u2019 (Ps. 89.13)\n(13) \u05d5\u05bc \u05d3\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d9\u05b8 \u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05df\u05d4\u05b6 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b5 \u05d1\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0\u05b5 \u05dc\u05b8 \u05d4\u05e9\u05b6 \u05e2\u05b1\u05d0\u05b6 \u05be\u05d4\u05de\u05b8 \u05d9\u05ea\u05bc\u05b7 \u05e0\u05b9 \u05d1\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018\u2026and for my daughters, what should I do for these today\nor for their sons which they have borne?\u2019 (Gen. 31.43)\n(14) \u05dd\u05db\u05b6\u05dc\u05b8 \u05dd\u05d7\u05b5\u05dc\u05b8\u05d9\u05b4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d4 \u05dd\u05db\u05b6 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b5\u05e4\u05b0 \u05dc \u05b4 \u05da\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05b9\u05d4\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05dd\u05db \u05b6\u05d9\u05d4\u05b5\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d4\u05d5\u05b8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b0\n\u2018The LORD your God who goes before you, he will fight for\nyou.\u2019 (Deut. 1.30)\n( 15) \u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05e2\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05ea\u05d0\u05b8 \u05de\u05b0 \u05d8\u05bb \u05d5\u05b0 \u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05bc\u05b7 \u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05dd\u05d9\u05de\u05b4 \u05dc\u05b8\u05e9\u05b0 \u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d7\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05d6\u05b6\u05de\u05b4 \u05e8\u05e9\u05b8 \u05d1\u05b8 \u05dc\u05db\u05bc\u05b7\u05d0\u05b9\u05ea\u05be\u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05e9\u05e4\u05b6 \u05e0\u05b6\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7\u05d5\u05b0\n\u05d4\u05b8 \u05d9\u05de\u05b6 \u05e2\u05bc\u05b7\u05de\u05b5 \u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05b4\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05e9\u05e4\u05b6 \u05e0\u05b6\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d4\u05ea\u05b8 \u05e8\u05b0 \u05db\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018But the person who eats flesh from the sacrifices of\nwellbeing which belong to the LORD and his uncleanness\nis upon him, that person shall be cut off from his relatives.\u2019\n(Lev. 7.20)\nA further insight was the discovery of the \u2018frame of reference\u2019\nconstruction, which is neither left dislocation nor topicalisation,\nbut rather a detached noun phrase, which provides the frame of\nreference for the discourse that follows (Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9\n2021): Generative Linguistics 35\n(16) \u05dd \u05dc\u05b8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05be\u05d3\u05e2\u05bc\u05b7 \u05da\u05e0\u05b0 \u05d9\u05d1\u05b5 \u05d5\u05bc \u05d9\u05e0\u05b4 \u05d9\u05d1\u05b5 \u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05b0 \u05d4\u05e0\u05b5 \u05d4\u05b4 \u05d4\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b8 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d0\u05b2 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05d3\u05b4 \u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05e8\u05d1\u05b8 \u05d3\u05b8\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018And the word which we spoke, I and you\u2014behold the\nLORD is between me and between you forever.\u2019 (1 Sam.\n20.23)\n3.4. Pronominal Syntax and the Meaning-Making of\nPronominal Reference\nThe so-called tripartite verbless clause in BH consists of two nom-\ninal phrases and a 3ms pronominal element. In the differentiation\nof the pronominal element, it is either a resumptive element of a\nleft dislocation construction or it is a \u2018last resort\u2019 syntactic strat-\negy in which the pronominal element is a pronominal clitic,\nproviding agreement features for the subject in order to prevent\nambiguity in the assignment of subject and predicate (Naud\u00e9\n1990; 1993b; 1994c; 1999; 2002a; 2002b). Disjunctive and con-\njunctive accents provide important evidence for prosodic phras-\ning, which can be utilised for differentiating the role of the\npronoun in these two types of sentences, which are otherwise\nstructurally identical (Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 2017). Cross-\nlinguistically, left dislocation involves a \u2018gap\u2019 at the boundary\nbetween the dislocated constituent and the matrix sentence. In\nspoken language, this gap may be realised by a small pause or an\ninterjection (Berman and Grosu 1976); in the MT it is marked by\na disjunctive accent. In this case the pronominal element is a\nresumptive of a left dislocation construction:\n(17) \u05df \u05d8\u05b8\u0591\u05b8\u05e7\u05b8\u05d4\u05b7 \u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05a3 \u05d3\u05d5\u05b4\u0596\u05b4\u05d3\u05b8\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018And (as for) David, he was the youngest.\u2019 (1 Sam. 17.14)\nWhere it is marked by a conjunctive accent, there is no gap\nand the pronominal element is utilised as a \u2018last resort\u2019 syntactic 36 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nstrategy. The pronominal element is a pronominal clitic, which is\nused to prevent ambiguity in the assignment of subject and predi-\ncate (see Doron 1986):\n(18) \u05d4 \u05d5\u05b4\u0596\u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05b0 \u05d0 \u05d5\u05d4\u059b \u05e7\u05d9\u05d3\u05bc\u05b4\u05a5 \u05b4\u05e6\u05b7\n\u2018A righteous one (he) is the LORD.\u2019 (Lam. 1.18)\nThe pronominal clitic is used to indicate that the adjectival con-\nstituent should be understood as the subject, rather than the\npredicate. The conjunctive accent on the first constituent and the\npronominal clitic that follows it indicates that the sentence\nshould be interpreted as \u2018A righteous one is the LORD\u2019, not as\n\u2018The LORD is righteous\u2019 (with the adjective as the predicate).\nGenerative linguistics has also been used to provide new\nand insightful analysis of several syntactic constructions involv-\ning pronouns. First, the so-called ethical dative with the preposi-\ntion lamed is not a sentence constituent but a reflexive anaphor\nthat is translated in English as x-self (e.g., Gen. 22.2 \u05be \u05dc\u05d0\u05b6 \u05da\u05b8\u0594 \u05dc\u05b0\u05be\u05da\u05b0\u05dc\u05b6 \u05d5\u05b0\n\u05d4\u05b8\u0591\u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4 \u05de\u05b9 \u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05e5\u05e8\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b6\u0596\u05b6 \u2018and take yourself to the land of Moriah\u2019; Naud\u00e9 1995,\n1997).\nSecond, all of the dative constructions in BH can be differ-\nentiated with attention to their syntactic features as identified by\ngenerative grammar (Naud\u00e9 2013); these are summarised in\nTable 1.

Holmstedt 2009; Scheumann 2020). In\nlight of the characteristics of null subject languages generally, it\nis preferable to identify so-called coordinate subjects with\nindependent personal pronouns in BH as adjuncts rather than\nsentence subjects (e.g., Judg. 11.37 \u05d4 \u05db\u05b6\u05d1\u05b0\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d5\u05b0 \u05dd\u05d9\u05e8\u05b8\u0594\u05b4\u05d4\u05b8\u05d4\u05b5\u05bd\u05b6\u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d9\u05ea\u05b4\u05a3\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05e8\u05bc\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05d5\u05b0 \u05d4 \u05db\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05bd\u05b5\u05d5\u05b0\n\u05d9\u05ea\u05b5\u05bd\u05b8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05e8\u05b5\u05d5\u05b0 \u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u0596\u05b4\u05e0\u05b9 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05d9\u05dc\u05bc\u05b7\u05b8\u0594\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u05d1\u05b0 \u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05bc\u05b7 \u2018and I will go up and down on the mountains\nand mourn for my virginity, I and my companions\u2019). The structural\nposition of an independent pronoun as a coordinate subject\ncoincides with that of a dislocated constituent in a left/right\ndislocation, namely, a constituent that is base generated in an\nadjunct position (Naud\u00e9 1999, 75\u201399).\nFinally, generative syntax provides a means to distinguish\nbetween pronouns and anaphora (i.e., linguistic units deriving\ntheir interpretation from a previously expressed unit of meaning,\nviz., an antecedent, such as reflexive pronouns and reciprocal\npronouns). Because pronouns and anaphora in BH have identical\nmorphological forms (contrast English pronouns I, me, my as 38 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\ndistinct from the reflexive anaphor myself and the reciprocal\nanaphor ourselves), one can only distinguish pronouns and ana-\nphora in BH on the basis of the theoretical syntactic principles of\ngenerative grammar; contrast the translation of the pronominal\nsuffix on \u05d5\u05b9\u05dc with the pronoun (\u2018him\u2019) in Neh. 13. 5 as opposed to\nthe anaphor (\u2018himself\u2019) in 1 Chron. 15.1. The syntax of the two\nsentences appears to be identical unless one appropriates the\ninsights afforded by generative linguistic theory (see Miller-\nNaud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 2019). Identifying whether a Hebrew form is\nan anaphor as opposed to a pronoun is critical for translating and\ninterpreting these biblical sentences.\n3.5. Lexical Categories and the Meaning-Making of\nLexical Morphology\nLexical categorisation or word classes (traditionally called \u2018parts\nof speech\u2019) in generative grammar is part of Universal Grammar.5\nAs indicated above in \u00a72.7, each lexical item in the mental\nlexicon is identified as a member of a particular category. For\nlexical categories (as opposed to functional/grammatical cate-\ngories\u2014see \u00a73.6), generative grammar employs the traditional\nphilological terms N(oun), V(erb), A (adjective/adverb), and\nP(reposition).\nA generative approach to lexical categories provides a\nheuristic method for lemmatisation within lexica as well as a\n5 See Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2017a, 276\u201388) for a description of\ncategorisation in generative grammar and a comparison of\ncategorisation in Functional Grammar, Cognitive Linguistics, and\nlinguistic typology. Generative Linguistics 39\nframework for differentiating morphosyntactic characteristics of\nlexical items as a basis for determining their semantic and prag-\nmatic value(s). As an example of a generative approach to lexical\ncategories, an analysis of \u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d8 demonstrates that it must be cate -\ngorised as an adjective and not a noun on the basis of morpho-\nlogical as well as internal and external syntactic features (Miller-\nNaud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 2017a, 288\u2013303; see also \u00a73.8).\n3.6. Quantification and the Meaning-Making of\nQuantifiers\nQuantifiers are a functional category in generative linguistics.\nQuantifiers specify the amount or quantity of the referents of a\nnoun. In this section, two kinds of quantification are considered:\nnegation and the quantifier \u05dc\u05db.\n3.6.1. Negation\nGenerative linguistics has contributed to a nuanced understand-\ning of the semantics of negation in BH through the concept of\nnegative scope, which allows interpreters to distinguish between\na negative marker that has scope over the entire predication\n(sentential negation) as opposed to scope over only a constituent\n(constituent negation; see Snyman and Naud\u00e9 2003; Snyman\n2004; Naud\u00e9 and Rendsburg 2013; Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9\n2015; 2017b).\nSentential negation requires the negative marker to\nimmediately precede the verb (e.g., Jer. 23.21 \u05be \u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d9\u05ea\u05b4 \u05d7\u05b0 \u05dc\u05b7\u05a5\u05bc\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8 \u05be\u05d0\u05b9 \u05dc\n\u05dd\u05d9\u05d0\u05b6\u0596 \u05b4\u05d1\u05b4 \u05e0\u05b0\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u2018I did not send the prophets\u2019). By contrast, constituent\nnegation immediately precedes a non-verbal constituent (e.g., 40 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nGen. 45.8 \u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05b8\u0591\u05b4\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u0596\u05b4 \u05d4\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b8\u0594\u05b5 \u05d9\u05ea \u05b4 \u05d0\u05b9 \u05dd\u05ea\u05bc\u05b6\u05a4\u05b6\u05d7\u05b0 \u05dc\u05bc\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0 \u05dd\u05ea\u05b6\u05bc\u05b6\u059e \u05d0\u05bc\u05b7 \u05be\u05d0\u05b9\u05dc\u05b5\u05bd \u05d4\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05b8\u0597 \u05e2\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d5\u05b0 \u2018 And now you\ndid not send me here, but rather God\u2019). For the negative cycle in\nBH, see \u00a73.9.\n3.6.2. Quantifier \u05dc\u05db\nGenerative linguistics allows interpreters to distinguish four\nsyntactic constructions involving the quantifier \u05dc\u05db, differentiated\nby specific features of the noun phrase ( NP) modified by \u05dc\u05db (see\nTable 2).6 The most important features are definiteness and\nnumber, but countability (count nouns, mass nouns, collectives),\nnominal status, and specificity are also relevant. Each construc-\ntion conveys various semantic nuances: singular definite (e.g., \u05be \u05dc\u05db\u05b8\n\u05d0 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d4\u05b6\u0596 \u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9 \u05d9\u05b7\u05a5\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u2018all that day\u2019 Exod. 10 .13), plural definite (e.g., \u05d9\u05de\u05b7\u05a5\u05b5\u05d9\u05b0\u05be\u05dc\u05db\u05b8\n\u05da\u05d9\u05d9\u05b5\u05bd\u05b6 \u05d7\u05bc\u05b7 \u2018all the days [totality of the specific group] of your life\u2019 Gen.\n3. 14), singular indefinite (e.g., \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u0597\u059c \u05d9\u05bc\u05b8\u0597 \u05be\u05dc\u05db\u05b8 \u2018every day\u2019 Ps. 140 .3), plural\nindefinite (e.g., \u05d4 \u05dc\u05b9\u05b5\u05bd\u05e9\u05b4 \u05d1\u05b0 \u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05b6\u0596\u05b4\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d4\u05b8\u05be\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05b5 \u05ea\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05b7\u05a5\u05d4\u05b1 \u05d9\u05de \u05b5\u05d9\u05b0\u05be\u05dc\u05db\u05b8 \u2018all [each and every\none of] the days the house of God was in Shiloh\u2019 Judg. 18.31).\nWhen the noun refers to a unique entity or a collective, the\nsingular definite quantified phrase means \u2018the whole\u2019 (e.g., \u05be\u05dc\u05db\u05b8\n\u05e5\u05e8 \u05b6\u05d0\u05b8\u0594\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8 \u2018the whole earth\u2019 Gen. 1.29; \u05dc\u05d4\u05b6\u0596\u05b8\u05e7\u05b8\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7\u05be\u05dc\u05db\u05b8 \u2018 the whole assembly\u2019\nEzra 2.64).\n6 See Naud\u00e9 (2011a; 2011b) for BH and Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2015;\n2022) and Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2020b) for Qumran Hebrew.

Relative Clauses and the Meaning-Making of\nRelative Nominal Modification\nThe fact that relative clauses in BH may be either restrictive\n(identifying the precise referent of the head noun) or non-\nrestrictive (qualifying but not identifying the head noun) in their\nsemantics went unnoticed by philologically-orientated Hebrew\ngrammars, but it is an important linguistic distinction with exe-\ngetical ramifications.\nHolmstedt (2016, 194\u2013215) provides the linguistic analysis\nof the two types of relative clauses and the linguistic indicators\nfor differentiating them.7 For example, in 2 Chron. 15.11 (\u05d5\u05bc \u05d7\u05bc\u05b6\u05a4 \u05d1\u05b0\u05d6\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d5\u05bc\u05b7\n\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u0591 \u05b4\u05d4\u05b5 \u05dc\u05dc\u05b6\u0596\u05b8\u05e9\u05b8 \u05d4\u05bc\u05b7\u05be\u05df\u05de\u05b4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d4\u05b8\u0594 \u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05b4\u05a3\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d4 \u05d5 \u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05bc\u05b7 ), the relative clause is syntactically\nmarked as restrictive because of the zero marked relative with a\ndefinite head (by contrast, zero marked relative clauses with an\nindefinite head are non-restrictive). The translation must be \u2018and\nthey sacrificed to the LORD on that day from the booty that they\nhad brought\u2019 (restrictive), rather than \u2018and they sacrificed to the\nLORD on that day from the booty, which they had brought\u2019 (non-\nrestrictive; see Holmstedt 2016, 210).\n7 For the restrictions on the resumptive element in Biblical Aramaic\nclauses, see Naud\u00e9 (1991b; 1996). Generative Linguistics 43\n3.8. Empty Categories, Null Constituents, and the\nMeaning-Making of Invisible Structure\nGenerative grammar employs a number of null (or, zero) items.\nNull items are present in the underlying structure of language but\nnot in the surface structure. Nonetheless, null items affect both\nthe surface realisation of language and its semantic inter-\npretation. A few of these null items are mentioned briefly in this\nsection.\nIn \u00a73.2, null subjects of finite verbs were discussed. These\nsubjects are not expressed in the surface structure, but they can\nnonetheless serve as an antecedent (see also \u00a73.4).\nIn \u00a73.3, the edge constructions that involve movement of a\nconstituent to the left (beginning) of the sentence (viz. topicali-\nsation) or to the right (end) of the sentence (viz. extraposition)\ncontain a null constituent. Moved constructions leave a trace in\ntheir original position, which may affect the structure of the\nsentence.\nRelative clauses may optionally have two types of null\nconstituents. Null heads are used frequently in BH (Holmstedt\n2016, 113\u201328) instead of a NP as head (contrast Gen. 27.45\nwith a null head and Gen. 24.66 with an overt NP as head; see\nHolmstedt 2016, 114). Interpretation of the semantics of the null\nhead depends upon both \u201cthe position of the gap (or trace) or\nresumptive within the relative clause and the discourse context\u201d\n(Holmstedt 2016, 115). Zero relatives also occur in BH, alongside\na range of overt relative markers (Holmstedt 2016, 81\u201383). As\nindicated in \u00a73.7, zero marked relative clauses have a restrictive\nsemantic interpretation when the head of the relative is definite, 44 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nwhereas overtly marked relative clauses may have a restrictive\nor non-restrictive semantic interpretation.\nRecognising that adjectives in BH may modify a null noun\nprovides a principled way to handle the identification of the\n\u2018 adjective\u2019 lexical category. For example, in Gen. 29.16 (\u05d9 \u05ea\u05b4\u05a3\u05b5\u05e9\u05b0 \u05df\u05d1\u05b6\u0596\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05d5\u05bc\n\u05dc \u05d7\u05b5\u05bd\u05b5\u05e8\u05b8 \u05d4\u05e0\u05b6\u0596\u05b8\u05d8\u05bc\u05b7 \u05e7\u05b0 \u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05dd\u05e9\u05b7\u05a5\u05b5\u05d5\u05b0 \u05d4\u05d0\u05b8\u0594\u05b8 \u05dc\u05b5 \u05d4 \u05dc\u05b8\u05b9\u05d3\u05d2\u05bc\u05b0\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u05dd\u05e9\u05bc\u05b6\u05a4\u05b5 \u05ea\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u0591\u05d1\u05b8 ), the determined adjectives \u05d4 \u05dc\u05b8\u05b9\u05d3\u05d2\u05bc\u05b0\u05d4\u05bc\u05b7\n\u2018the big\u2019 and \u05d4 \u05e0\u05b6\u0596\u05b8 \u05d8\u05bc\u05b7 \u05e7\u05b0 \u05d4\u05bc\u05b7 \u2018the small\u2019 must be understood as morpho-\nlogically agreeing with and modifying the null noun \u05ea\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7 , so that\nthe adjectives refer to \u2018the elder [daughter]\u2019 and \u2018the younger\n[daughter]\u2019 (see Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 2016). Recognition\nthat an adjective may modify a null noun provides a principled\nlinguistic argument against so-called \u2018substantival adjectives\u2019 in\nBH.\nAnother advance has been made in recognising that so-\ncalled \u2018verbless sentences\u2019 should be understood as sentences in\nwhich the copular verb \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 is a null constituent (see, e.g. Naud\u00e9\n1993a; DeCaen 1999; Sinclair 1999; Cowper and DeCaen 2017;\nWilson 2020). Recognition that all predications in Biblical\nHebrew have the same underlying structure provides a simplified\nand unified analysis.\nFinally, ellipsis comprises a number of distinct syntactic\nconstructions in which one or more required constituents are\npresent in the underlying representation but are absent in the\nsurface structure (see Miller-Naud\u00e9 2005; 2007a; 2007b; 2007c;\n2008; 2011; 2013; Holmstedt 2021). Ellipsis therefore requires\nthe hearer/reader to be able to reconstruct appropriate seman-\ntic interpretations of sentences with apparently incomplete\nstructures. Generative Linguistics 45\n3.9. Historical Linguistics and Meaning-Making\nthrough Language Change and Variation\nGenerative linguistics provides a way to identify language change\nand variation through the change of feature parameters. In exam-\nining the change of feature parameter settings between BH and\nQumran Hebrew, Naud\u00e9 (2000; see also 1996a) identifies the\nfollowing types of changes: change in syntactic category descrip-\ntion (viz. grammaticalisation); change in subcategorisation frame\nof some lexical verbs (e.g., the use of the preposition \u05d1\u05b0 to mark\nthe accusative; contrast Jer. 7.26 with 4Q506 131\u2013132.IV.13)\nand lexical nouns (contrast Isa. 48.17 and 1QIsaa XL:23); and\nchanges in lexical features of both nouns and verbs.\nAnother important development in historical linguistics\nrelates to cyclic change, the observation that change often occurs\nin stages, with later stages of the language resembling earlier\nstages (Van Gelderen 2011). One important cycle that has been\nidentified in many languages involves the negative existential\n(see Veselinova 2016), which is also operative in pre-modern\nHebrew (see Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 2016; Naud\u00e9, Miller-\nNaud\u00e9, and Wilson 2019; 2022). One of the most important\ninsights for Biblical Hebrew is the fact that the stages of a cycle\nare usually overlapping, resulting in synchronic variation along-\nside diachronic change.\n4.0. Prospects for Further Study\nThe survey of the study of BH in Van der Merwe, Naud\u00e9, and\nKroeze (2017, 6\u201312) reveals that comparatively little work has\nbeen conducted from the theoretical standpoint of generative 46 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\nlinguistics, in spite of its rich and insightful contributions to the\nstudy of language in general and to the study of languages in\nparticular. As a point of comparison, Radford\u2019s (1997a; 1997b;\n2004; 2009) analyses of the structure of English from a Mini-\nmalist perspective demonstrate how generative linguistics can be\napplied to the study of a specific language to produce comprehen-\nsive grammatical analyses. There is, unfortunately, nothing even\nremotely comparable for BH from a generative perspective. The\nresearch described in the previous sections only begins to scratch\nthe surface of some of the numerous important, unsolved prob-\nlems in the structure of BH, which have direct implications for\nthe meaning-making enterprise of textual interpretation.\nTo conclude, we return to our initial questions. Is linguis-\ntics necessary for the interpretation of the languages of the bib-\nlical texts? Is it not better\u2014and easier\u2014just to read the texts\nwithout theory? In our view, the reading of the biblical texts in\nthe light of linguistic analysis can be compared to the work of\nmeteorologists. Meteorologists study weather patterns scientifi-\ncally, employing relevant theories for the observation, descrip-\ntion, and prediction of weather patterns. The results of meteoro-\nlogical inquiry feed into weather reports, which are delivered in\nsimple, accessible terms for ordinary people to understand.\nAlthough sustained observation of the weather by laypersons\n(e.g., in farming almanacs) may sometimes prove to produce\naccurate forecasts, it is not theoretically informed and does not\nrest upon scientifically proven methodology. It is therefore vastly\ninferior to the analysis of weather produced by meteorologists. Generative Linguistics 47\nIf linguistics is necessary for insightful understanding of the\nbiblical text, then which linguistic theory should be used? We\nneed to break with the tradition of viewing linguistics through\nthe reductive lenses of schools, theories, or interdisciplinary\nexchanges. Instead of the fragmentation of knowledge, the focus\nmust be on the progress of knowledge by its growth or accumu-\nlation (see D\u2019hulst and Gambier 2018). Furthermore, the search\nfor knowledge must be a purposeful, meaning-making activity\nthat is functionalist in orientation (Nord 2018). In other words,\nthe search for knowledge within a discipline must be nuanced\nand it must be typified by the purpose for which it is intended.\nIn applying the discipline of linguistics to the study of the\nbiblical text, instead of competition between linguistic theories,\nthe move should be to a search for a complex viewpoint, seeing\nthe study of BH as a complex whole (Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9\n2020a; Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 2020). However, within a com-\nplex approach, the significant and insightful generative linguistic\ncontributions to understanding BH language structure cannot be\nminimised or ignored.\n5.0.

FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR AND THE\nPRAGMATICS OF INFORMATION\nSTRUCTURE FOR BIBLICAL LANGUAGES\nRandall Buth\nThe pragmatics of information structure, and Functional Gram-\nmar in particular, encourage and provide a framework for\nstudents and scholars of the biblical languages to read with\nincreased nuance and precision.\n1.0. Historical Development\nFunctional grammatical approaches include semantic and prag-\nmatic information in a grammatical description. Pragmatics\nrefers to the effects that are made within communication and will\nbe discussed below. This inclusion of pragmatic information\nwithin a formal grammatical description can be contrasted to\ntransformational-generative approaches that adopt a policy of\nautonomous syntax. The Functional Grammar (FG) developed by\nSimon Dik in particular reflects the confluence of two develop-\nments in linguistics: (1) the pragmatics of information struc-\nture as extrapolated, for example, from Functional Sentence\n\u00a9 2023 Randall Buth, CC BY-NC 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358.02 68 Buth\nPerspective (FSP)1 and (2) generative-transformational grammars\nthat stem from Noam Chomsky, especially 1957\u20131980. The pri-\nmary pragmatic functions that were incorporated in the early\nsentence grammar of FG were Topic and Focus, discussed below.\nGenerative and transformational grammar were a major\nimpetus for FG. A generative grammar wants to know the rules\nthat will produce all acceptable, grammatical sentences of a\nlanguage and restrict the production of unacceptable, ungram-\nmatical sentences. The primary difference between a strictly\ngenerative approach and functional approaches can be summa-\nrised in the notion \u2018autonomous syntax\u2019, which is the restricted\ndomain of formal grammar without including semantic or prag-\nmatic information in the rules. Functional approaches to gram-\nmar, on the other hand, reject such a restriction and recognise\nthat pragmatic functions like Topic and Focus exert direct influ-\nence on the rules. In addition to including pragmatics in formal\ngrammatical description, FG eschews the idea of transformations\nand filtering devices in formal grammar as psychologically prob-\nlematic, as discussed below.\nDik published the basis of this approach in two volumes\n(1978; 1980). From the beginning, he embraced a principle of\n1 For examples, see Dane\u0161 (1974) and Firbas (1992). The roots of FSP\nprecede World War II. FSP broadly analyses communication as\ncomprising known or assumed information as a base that is called the\nTheme. New or salient information is then added to the Theme as the\nintended communication. This salient meaning is termed the Rheme. In\nEnglish, these two perspectives are often called Topic and Comment,\nrespectively. Functional Grammar 69\nrigorous formalism in his theory. The various systems of syntax\n(like predicates, subjects, and objects), semantic roles (like agent,\nexperiencer, and patient), and pragmatics (like Topic and Focus)\nare assumed to influence the final output of a sentence and\nshould be included within formal grammar. However, as these\nideas were applied in studies on various languages, the complexi-\nties inherent in these notions have led to increasingly complex\nnotation. Dik (1989) expanded many kinds of Topics and Foci.\nSome ideas from discourse analysis and greater attention to prag-\nmatics led to positing multiple layers of underlying represen-\ntation before the surface level sentences would be generated or\ninterpreted within a grammar.\nA former student and colleague, Kees Hengeveld, edited\nand published Dik\u2019s work posthumously in 1997. Hengeveld and\nJ. Lachlan McKenzie then went on to include a formal discourse\nframework within that theory, ideas that developed out of a con-\ncern to include syntax, semantics, and pragmatics within formal\ngrammatical theory. Hengeveld and McKenzie forged these into\na comprehensive theory with four abstract layers. They published\ntheir collaborative effort in 2008, Functional Discourse Grammar\n(FDG; for a brief description of FDG, see Hengeveld and\nMcKenzie 2005, 668\u201376). Since then, FDG has been considered\nthe successor of FG and current studies tend to use the 2008\nvolume as a starting point. However, the complex metalanguage\nof later developments presents a barrier for those primarily inter-\nested in biblical languages, while the initial pragmatic functions\nin FG are more accessible. Concepts from information structure\nare widely used within other functional grammars (see, e.g., 70 Buth\nGiv\u00f3n 1984, who downplays rigorous formalism, and then Giv\u00f3n\n2001, where he reincorporates some formalism; see also Foley\nand Van Valin 1984). The pragmatic functions of information\nstructure within FG will therefore be the primary focus here.\n2.0. Key Theoretical Commitments and Major\nConcepts\nPeople communicate with language, prototypically with sound,\nbut also in written media and in sign languages. A signal is\nintended to communicate meaning. In \u2018The girl walked to the\nmarket\u2019, the speaker wants the hearer to think about a particular\ngirl, a particular market, and communicates that the girl walked\nthere. Grammatical theories attempt to explain how that sentence\nis produced.\nWith this in mind, FG aims at several goals.2 These include,\nfirst, typological adequacy, meaning the theory should be formu-\nlated in terms of rules and principles that apply to any natural\nlanguage. Second, pragmatic adequacy, meaning the theory\nshould explain how linguistic expressions may be used in com-\nmunication. Third, psychological adequacy, meaning that what\nthe theory says about a language should be compatible with what\nis known about the psychological mechanisms involved in natu-\nral language processing.\nTo these ends, FG has identified certain functions that\naffect the output of a predication into sentences. These include:3\n2 See Dik (1980, 2).\n3 See Dik (1980, 3). Functional Grammar 71\nSEMANTIC FUNCTIONS (Agent, Patient, Recipient, etc.),\nwhich define the roles that participants play in states of\naffairs, as designated by predications.\nSYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS (Subject and Object), which define\ndifferent perspectives through which states of affairs are\npresented in linguistic expressions.\nPRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS (Theme and Tail, Topic and Focus),\nwhich define the informational status of constituents of\nlinguistic expressions. These relate to the embedding of\nthe expression in ongoing discourse and are determined\nby the status of the pragmatic information of Speaker and\nAddressee as it develops in verbal interaction.\nUsing these functions, FG posits that an underlying abstract\npredication frame could produce the following sentences:\n(1) The girl walked to the market in the morning.\n(2) In the morning the girl walked to the market.\n(3) As for the girl, she walked to the market in the morning.\nThe predication frame comes from the abstract lexicon of a lan-\nguage and would join three arguments (sentence constituents) to\nthat predication, \u2018to walk\u2019: the girl, to the market, and in the\nmorning. These arguments receive different taggings for syntax,\nsemantic roles, and optionally pragmatics. In (1), the girl\n[Subject,\nis a syntactic Subject and semantic Agent, while to the market\nAgent]\nis a semantic Goal and in the morning is a semantic Time.\n[Goal] [Time]\nThe semantic taggings are the same for (2), however in the\nmorning is both semantic Time and pragmatic Topic. In\n[Time, Topic]\n(3), as for the girl is a pragmatic Theme, a framework for\n[Theme] 72 Buth\nthe sentence similar to Topic but outside the sentence syntax. She\nis a syntactic Subject and semantic Agent, while to the\n[Subject, Agent]\nmarket is a semantic Goal. Notice the difference between (1)\n[Goal]\nand (2). The predication frame and the semantics are the same,\nbut the pragmatics differ. In (1) the Time in the morning is part of\nthe new, salient, rhemic/comment information, but in (2) in the\nmorning has been placed at the beginning according to pragmatic\nplacement rules. There the argument is tagged a Topic to provide\na pragmatic setting or situational orientation for the communica-\ntion that follows.4\nFG assumes that predications use the functions explained above\nto generate sentences, a process which occurs with abstract\ntemplates specific to a particular language. The template speci-\nfies where certain functions may appear, and positions in the\ntemplates can be filled by individual words, phrases, and clauses.\nSo discussions about word order are actually about constituents\nor \u2018pieces\u2019 of a sentence that are positioned to fulfil one of the\nsyntactic, semantic, or pragmatic functions. A sentence is able to\norganise and output the functions as follows:5\n(4) Theme; Pragmatic positions, Syntactic positions; Tail\nWithin this template, syntactic positions might involve numer-\nous variations, such as S\u2013O\u2013X; S\u2013V\u2013O\u2013X; V\u2013S\u2013O\u2013X, etc. But\n4 A Topic is pragmatically marked material that orientates a sentence to\nits context. It does not have Focus intonation and is not necessarily the\nbroader subject matter of the sentence.\n5 The templates in (4) are also simplified and without the algebraic\nnotation of much of FG and FDG. Functional Grammar 73\npragmatic positions appear before syntactic positions, which is\nfundamentally important for FG and for human communication\nin general.6 Such a pragmatic position allows FG to explain a\nphenomenon in V\u2013S\u2013O languages, namely the possibility of S\u2013V\u2013\nO as an/the alternative order (see Dik 1980, 155).\nWhile syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions are all\nnecessary for FG as a theory, understanding pragmatic functions\nmay help readers of biblical languages most. Pragmatic functions\nare part of all natural language and must be internalised to com-\nmunicate in any given language. Two of the pragmatic functions\nnoted in (4) operate outside sentence syntax and are separated\nby semicolons in the templates. First, the Tail is an afterthought,\nprototypically at the end of a sentence, whether as a side com-\nment or reinforcement. Also, a phrase like an appositive or paren-\nthetical comment can be treated as a Tail that may be placed\ninside a syntactical sentence. Second, the Theme is any intro-\nductory, setting, or topical material that is prototypically at the\nbeginning of a sentence, traditionally treated as a casus pendans\nand called left dislocation in linguistics.\nThe FSP distinction between Topic and Comment has led\nto a foundational distinction of marked information structure in\nFG: Topic and Focus. A Topic constituent is specially marked\n6 As part of typological adequacy, FG theorises that a potential\npragmatic position exists at the beginning of a main clause of whatever\nthe basic order may be. FG does not claim that devices like intonation,\nmorphology, or special vocabulary do not also play roles in informa-\ntional pragmatics. But placement rules and positions before the main\nsyntactic components are stipulated as universal. 74 Buth\ninformation that is presupposed or already established. It is a\nstarting point for the rest of the sentence and potentially linked\nto the larger context. A sentence constituent that functions as\nTopic is eligible for placement in a pragmatic position before the\nmain, default sentence order. But a Topic is not necessarily the\nsyntactic Subject, which often creates confusion. In English, the\nword \u2018topic\u2019 is a synonym of \u2018subject\u2019. But in FG a marked Topic\nis specifically a constituent that provides a framework and link\nto the larger context in which a sentence occurs. It may be a\nSubject, but it may also be some other constituent. Given this\npotential confusion, I use the term Topic in this article when\ntrying to relate primarily to FG and broader linguistic literature.\nBut I use the term Contextualising Constituent (CC) when includ-\ning the multivalent nature of pragmatic Topics that goes beyond\nmarked constituents as subjects and settings.\nA Focus constituent is a specially marked part of the Com-\nment, which contains the new or most important information of\na sentence. Focus may be marked by word order, particles, and\noften intonation. It can include many kinds of Comment infor-\nmation, including new, supplemental, reinforced old, contrastive,\nor contra-expected information.7\nFG thus helps identify pragmatic placements in word order\nand the resulting nuances of understanding. But because FG aims\nat both psychological and pragmatic adequacy, it does not allow\nunmotivated, ad hoc rules to correct mis-predictions of hypothe-\nsised rules. This can be stated in four principles:\n7 Lambrecht (1994) adds \u2018sentence focus\u2019 to the Topic and Focus of\ninformation structure, as discussed below. Functional Grammar 75\n1. Avoid transformations in the sense of structure-changing\noperations;\n2. Avoid empty elements in underlying structure that are\nunexpressed;\n3. Disallow filter devices;\n4. Disallow abstract lexical decomposition (instead, account\nfor meaning with definitions).\nSo if a constituent is pragmatically placed at the beginning of the\nclause, and the language regularly follows with V\u2013S, then that\nlanguage shows a basic order of V\u2013S. FG does not unnecessarily\nmultiply rules. FG would not suggest an abstract S\u2013V order, place\na pragmatic function in front, and then add a filter to flip the S\u2013\nV order to match the data. An additional rule that would switch\nthe placement of S and V after a pragmatic placement would be\nad hoc. Instead, FG asks simple questions: Would such rules be\npsychologically real? Is there any pragmatic motivation for the\nrule? Are such rules necessary? If the not, then Occam\u2019s Razor\nand the minimal abstractness principle of FG declare such a rule\nto be contra-indicated and ad hoc.\nThese principles have been particularly helpful in describ-\ning word order patterns in Germanic languages, but may also be\napplied to the biblical languages.8 For illustration, FG can demon-\nstrate a continuum between various V\u2013S languages to the point\nwhere one may develop into an S\u2013V language. Four categories of\nthese languages are described:\n8 Dik (1980, 152\u201377) devotes a whole chapter to this question. 76 Buth\nV1 (verb first), where the statistical majority of sentences\nshow V\u2013S at the beginning of the clause.\nThere do not appear to be any V\u2013S languages that do not also\nallow S\u2013V word order. This fact supports the typological ade-\nquacy of FG, which assumes a pragmatic position before a main\nclause of whatever the basic order may be.\nV2 (verb second), where the majority of sentences show some\nnon-verb element first in a pragmatic position.\nIn these languages, a pragmatic position rule is activated fairly\ncommonly.\nV2s (verb strongly second), where all sentences, allowing for\nsome pragmatic exceptions, show the verb in a second\nposition.\nA V2s language might look like an S\u2013V language at first glance.\nA pragmatic positioning rule becomes mandatory, thereby dilut-\ning the strength of the pragmatic marking. The only choice is\nwhether the Subject or some other constituent fills the pragmatic\nposition. \u201cA V2s language will only have the following constitu-\nent orderings: a. SVO, b. XVS(O)\u201d (Dik 1980, 158). In terms of\npragmatics, the S\u2013V orders in a V2s language will function simi-\nlarly to the way that Subjects function in real S\u2013V languages.\nV3 (verb third), where the verb comes third whenever a con-\nstituent is pragmatically placed at the beginning, before\nthe syntactic S\u2013V.\nIn V3 languages, the Subject follows the pragmatic position, so\nthat the Verb comes third. Without a pragmatically positioned Functional Grammar 77\nconstituent, the Verb may appear second, after the Subject. In\nother words, a V3 language is a true S\u2013V language, as is English.9\nNot only can FG meaningfully describe the various cate-\ngories of word order, but FG also predicts historical development\nwith increasing optional use of pragmatic placement rules\nthrough time. Eventually, a V2s language can become a V3 lan-\nguage. Dik (1980, 169\u201375) lists Celtic languages and Welsh as\nexamples of V1. Then, within Germanic languages, Old Icelandic,\nOld High German, and Middle Dutch are V2; Icelandic, Norse,\nDanish, and others are V2s; and finally English is V3 (SVO).\nThe importance of these basic concepts of FG is best appre-\nciated when looking at the data of real languages. The next sec-\ntion shows how an FG approach can aid the reading and under-\nstanding of biblical texts.10\n9 This does not mean that additional patterns do not exist. For example,\nEnglish has a vestigial question order \u2018When did the girl return?\u2019 The\norder \u2018did the girl\u2019 is V\u2013S and reflects an archaic word order pattern in\nthe history of Germanic languages.\n10 FG also deals with highly presupposed information that is attracted\nto Verbs in what is called Language Independent Preferred Order of\nConstituents (LIPOC), as well as secondary clines of post-verbal\nsaliency. These ideas are not discussed in this essay, as they are less\nimportant for the general reader of biblical languages. 78 Buth\n3.0. Use and Contributions of FG in Biblical\nStudies\n3.1. Application to Hebrew\nSome scholars of Biblical Hebrew have claimed that the language\nis based on S\u2013V order, while a majority counter that it has a V\u2013S\norder. Even claims that there is no basic order must still explain\nthe examples of both S\u2013V and V\u2013S order.11 Recognising constitu-\nents in communication that have special pragmatic marking can\nbe a powerful tool for readers and for an audience. Pragmatic\nsignals add information and perspective beyond the basic refer-\nential semantics of a communication.\n3.1.1. A Test for V\u2013S\u2013O in Hebrew\nDik (1980, 154) provides a simple test that has explanatory\npower for Biblical Hebrew:\nIf, whenever some constituent other than the Subject is\nbrought to P1, the Subject itself appears in preverbal\nposition, then the language is a \u2018real\u2019 SVO language with\nbasic pattern P1SVO.\n11 See Hornkohl (2018), who has provided a review of word order\nstudies and found the arguments for a S\u2013V word order unpersuasive. He\nalso recognises that this means that all S\u2013V orders would need prag-\nmatic explanations, both by those positing a V\u2013S default order and by\nthose who might claim that all orders are pragmatically motivated in\nBH. Functional Grammar 79\nIf on the other hand, the Subject appears in postverbal\nposition in that condition, then the basic pattern must have\nbeen P1VSO.\nThis is so because FG provides no other means for explain-\ning the occurrence of postverbal Subjects than the assump-\ntion that the basic position of the Subject is postverbal in\nsuch cases. In particular, purported rules of Subject Post-\nposing of Subject Verb Inversion simply cannot be formu-\nlated within the framework of FG. Part of the aim of this\nchapter is to demonstrate that this is an advantage rather\nthan a weakness.\nAccording to the criterion formulated above, English is a\nreal P1SVO language. On the other hand, Dutch, German,\nand in fact all the other living Germanic languages come\nout as P1VSO languages according to this criterion.\nGenerally speaking, in BH, when some item other than a con-\njunction and a Subject is pre-verbal, the remaining order is V\u2013S,\nwhich is what FG predicts for a V\u2013S\u2013O language, as in (5a):\n(5) (a) \u05d7 \u05b7 \u05e0\u05b9 \u05be\u05da\u05b0\u05dc\u05b6 \u05d4\u05b7\u05ea\u05b0 \u05d4\u05b4 \u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d4\u05b8\u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6\n\u2018With God Noah walked\u2019 [X \u2013V\u2013S] (Gen. 6.9)\nFocus\n(b) \u05da\u05dc\u05b6\u05d4\u05b7\u05ea\u05b0 \u05d4\u05b4 \u05d7\u05b7 \u05e0\u05b9 \u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d4\u05b8\u05be\u05ea \u05d0\u05b6 * [X \u2013S \u2013V]12\nFocus\nAn S\u2013V model with the same contextual pragmatics would have\nincorrectly predicted (5b).13 The texts in (6) and (7) provide\n12 In linguistics, an asterisk marks either an incorrect/ungrammatical or\nan unattested form.

Topic and Focus in a VSO Framework\nSeveral examples in Hebrew can illustrate how Topic and Focus\nfunction in a V\u2013S\u2013O framework before looking at greater\nsentence-level effects.\nLooking first at examples of Focus, consider (8):\n(8) \u05ea\u05d0\u05b9\u05d6 \u05d9\u05ea\u05b4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05b4 \u05e2\u05b8 \u05d9\u05e4\u05b7 \u05db\u05b7 \u05df\u05b9 \u05d9\u05e7\u05b0 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0 \u05d5\u05bc \u05d9\u05d1\u05b4 \u05d1\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05be\u05dd\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d1\u05b0\n\u2018with an innocent heart and clean hands I did this\u2019\n[Focus]\n(Gen. 20.5)\nIn this example, the pre-verbal material is the main point, part of\nthe Comment and a marked Focus construction. Something simi-\nlar occurs in (9): Functional Grammar 81\n(9) \u05d9 \u05ea\u05bc\u05b4 \u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05d3\u05b4 \u05d9\u05e1\u05b4\u05e2\u05b0\u05db\u05b7\u05d5\u05b0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05b4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05b4 \u05d1\u05b9 \u05e8\u05de\u05b5 \u05be\u05d9\u05db\u05b4\n\u2018because from much thought and anger I was speaking\u2019\n[Focus]\n(1 Sam. 1.16)\nIn the context, Hanna is explaining her own behaviour, so the\nwords \u2018much thought and anger\u2019 are the salient, main part of the\nComment of the sentence. They are placed in front of the verb as\na marked Focus. As a final example, answers to questions fre-\nquently use fronting for the most meaningful part of an answer,\nas in (10):\n(10) \u05da \u05d9\u05d3\u05b6\u05d1\u05b8\u05e2\u05b2 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05d1\u05b8 \u05d3\u05d0\u05b9 \u05de\u05b0 \u05d4\u05e7\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d7\u05e8\u05b0 \u05e5\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05b6 \u05de\u05b5 \u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b5 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05de\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b9\u05d9\u05d5 \u05b7 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05b9\u05d1\u05ea\u05bc\u05b8 \u05df\u05d9\u05b4\u05d0\u05b7 \u05de\u05b5 \u05d5\u05bc\n\u2018\u201c\u2026and from where would you be coming?\u201d And they said\nto him, \u201cFrom a very far country have come your\n[Focus]\nservants\u201d\u2019 (Josh. 9.8\u20139)\nTurning now to consider pragmatic Topics, the text in (11)\nprovides a good example:\n(11) \u05dd \u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05e8\u05de\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b9 \u05d9\u05d5\u05b7 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b8\u05d9\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4\u05b7 \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b7 \u05d4\u05de\u05b9 \u05dc\u05b9\u05e9\u05b0 \u05be\u05dc\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05b8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b0 \u05d4\u05d0\u05b8 \u05e8\u05b0 \u05e0 \u05b4 \u05df\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05d1\u05b0\u05d2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\n\u2018In Gibeon appeared the LORD to Solomon in a night\n[Topic]\ndream, and God said\u2026\u2019 (1 Kgs 3.5)\nThis is classic syntax of V\u2013S where the MT has a pragmatic Topic\n(CC) that provides a locational setting to the sentence and the\ngreater context.14 Something similar occurs in (12):\n(12) (a) \u05d4 \u05de\u05b8 \u05d7\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b4 \u05dc \u05b7 \u05dd\u05d9\u05ea\u05bc\u05b4 \u05e9\u05b0 \u05dc\u05b4\u05e4\u05b0 \u05ea\u05d0\u05e8\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0 \u05dc\u05b4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05b5 \u05e8\u05b8\u05e9\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b4 \u05d0\u05e6\u05b5 \u05d9\u05b5\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and Israel went out to the Philistines for war\u2019\n[VS]\n(b) \u05e8 \u05d6\u05b6\u05e2\u05b5\u05d4\u05b8 \u05df\u05d1\u05b6\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d4\u05b8\u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05b7 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05d7\u05b2 \u05d9\u05b7\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and they camped at Even-Ezer \u2019\n[VX]\n14 The place Gibeon provides a Setting for the scene rather than a subject\nof a sentence, which is why the term Topic can be misleading and why\nI prefer Contextualising Constituent. 82 Buth\n(c) \u05e7 \u05e4\u05b5 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05d1\u05b7 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05d7\u05b8 \u05dd\u05d9\u05ea\u05bc\u05b4 \u05e9\u05b0 \u05dc\u05b4\u05e4\u05b0 \u05d5\u05bc\n\u2018and the Philistines camped at Afeq\u2019 (1 Sam.\n[S, Topic]\n4.1)\nIn this example, the Philistines are marked as a Topic that pro-\nvides comparison and contrast with Israel.\n3.1.3. Subordinating Clause with Focus\nMost subordinating conjunctions in BH introduce a V\u2013S clause.\nHowever, pragmatic frontings may occur. The following two\nexamples have subordinating conjunctions, one with a fronted\nSubject and one with a fronted Object. Both fronted constituents\nare pragmatically marked as Focus.\n(13) \u05dd \u05ea\u05b7 \u05d1\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d2\u05b0 \u05dc\u05d7\u05b5\u05e8\u05b8 \u05d9\u05db\u05b4 \u05d1\u05b9\u05e7\u05e2\u05b2\u05d9\u05b7 \u05e2\u05d3\u05b7 \u05d9\u05b8\u05be\u05d0\u05b9 \u05dc\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018And Jacob did not know]V-S[ that Rachel stole them\n[S, Focus]\n[the household gods]\u2019 (Gen. 31.32)\nThe Subject comes before the Verb inside this \u05d9\u05db-clause. \u2018Rachel\u2019\ncan be read as a Focus and as exclusive and contra-expected\ninformation from Jacob\u2019s perspective. He already knew that a\ntheft had occurred. Consider also (14):\n(14) \u05d4 \u05e9\u05b8 \u05e2\u05b8 \u05d4\u05e7\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05e6\u05b0\u05be\u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05d2\u05db\u05b0\n\u2018as a nation that righteousness it did\u2019 (Isa. 58.2)\n[Focus, Obj]\nAgain, placing the Object before the Verb can be explained here\nas Focus, because \u05d4\u05e7\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8 \u05e6\u05b0 \u2018righteousness, justice\u2019 is a contra-\nexpected point for irony: \u2018as if they were a nation that did what\nwould be, in fact, right\u2019.\nIn general, subordinating conjunctions provide a link to a\ncontext themselves, so they do not regularly need a pragmatic\nTopic to link to the context. Thus, if the subordinate clause marks\na pragmatic position, it is most often Focus, with the most salient Functional Grammar 83\npart of a sentence placed before the Verb. This, too, helps the\naudience and readers, who would add a Focal intonation to dif-\nferentiate Focus from Topic.\n3.1.4. Template for Participles in Hebrew\nThe advantage of a rule-based approach to word orders can be\nillustrated with participles as well. Most grammarians recognise\nthat the Hebrew participle fits a pattern that is more congruent\nto a Verbless clause than to a clause with a finite verb (for more\ndetails, see Buth 1999). In FG, the template for Biblical Hebrew\nparticiples is thus\n(+/- Topic) (+/- Focus) S\u2013Predicate\nwhere the \u2018+/-\u2019 notation makes explicit that the use of either a\nTopic or a Focus is optional. In the case of participles, the pred-\nicate would be Participle + Complements. Consider the follow-\ning example:\n(15) (a) \u05d5 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b0 \u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4 \u05d4\u05d0\u05b6 \u05b9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b7 \u05be\u05d4\u05de\u05b8\n\u2018What do you see, Jeremiah?\u2019\n[O, Focus]\n(b) \u05d4 \u05d0\u05b6\u05b9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d0\u05b2 \u05d3\u05e7\u05bc\u05b5\u05e9\u05b8 \u05dc\u05e7\u05bc\u05b5 \u05de\u05b7\n\u2018An almond stick I see.\u2019 [S\u2013V ]\n[O, Focus] Participle\n(c) \u05ea \u05d5\u05b9\u05d0\u05e8\u05b0 \u05dc\u05b4 \u05ea\u05bc \u05b8 \u05d1\u05b0 \u05d8\u05b7 \u05d9\u05d4\u05b5\n\u2018You\u2019ve done well to see\u2019\n(d) \u05d5\u05b9\u05ea\u05b9 \u05e9\u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b7 \u05d9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d1\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05b7 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d0\u05b2 \u05d3\u05e7\u05bc\u05b5 \u05b9\u05e9\u05be\u05d9\u05db\u05b4\n\u2018for diligent am I on my word to do it\u2019\n[Focus]\n(Jer. 1.11\u201312)\nIn (15), a question word \u2018what?\u2019 in (15a) is positioned as Focus\nand helps us recognise the salient, new information in the fol-\nlowing answer. Jeremiah\u2019s answer in (15b), \u2018an almond stick\u2019, has 84 Buth\nbeen placed ahead of the Subject\u2013Participle, in the pragmatic\nposition as Focus, as the pragmatically marked new information.\nThe main sentence in (15b), \u2018I see\u2019, is known, pre-supposed infor-\nmation and follows the Focal Object. The Subject immediately\nahead of the participle is not pragmatically marked.\nParticipial clauses and verbless clauses have a default,\nSubject\u2013Predicate word order, different from finite verbal clauses\nwith V\u2013S order. When a word order of Participle\u2013Subject occurs,\nthen, as in (15d) and (16) below, there is pragmatic marking of\nthe Participle, most often Focus:\n(16) \u05d9\u05db\u05b4 \u05e0\u05b9 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05df\u05d3\u05b8 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b9\u05d1\u05e2\u05b2 \u05d9\u05b7 \u05e8\u05e9\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b2 \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05d2\u05d4\u05b7\u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05dd\u05d2 \u05b7\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018and in addition, the nation that they serve (as slaves)\n[Topic]\nI am going to judge \u2019 (Gen. 15.14)\n[Focus]\nIn (16), the long Object \u2018the nation that they serve\u2019 is positioned\nas a Topic to provide the starting point and contextual link for\nthe sentence \u2018I am going to judge the nation\u2019. However, contrary\nto the basic Subject\u2013Participle word order, the participle comes\nbefore the Subject so that the participle is a second, pragmatically\npositioned constituent. The immediate and most natural reading\nis that the \u2018judging\u2019 is Focus, contra-expected, and specially\nmarked.\nWe should also note the pattern of Topic\u2013Focus order in all\nof the above examples that have more than one pragmatically\npositioned constituent. This Topic\u2013Focus order is normal in BH\nand fits with a universal tendency seen in languages around the\nworld. Consider the text in (17):\n(17) (a) \u05da \u05dc\u05bc\u05b5 \u05b9\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\n\u2018A generation goes,\u2019 Functional Grammar 85\n(b) \u05d0 \u05d1\u05b8 \u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018a generation comes,\u2019\n(c) \u05ea \u05d3\u05b6\u05de\u05b8 \u05b9\u05e2 \u05dd\u05dc\u05b8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05dc\u05b0 \u05e5\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018and as for the earth it remains forever \u2019\n[Topic] [Focus]\n(Eccl. 1.4)\nIn (17c), \u2018the earth\u2019 is not first because it is a grammatical\nSubject, but because it is pragmatically marked. In this verse, the\nrules of pragmatic placement help the reader to interpret the\nfunctions of the sentence pieces. The adverbial complement \u05dd\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05dc\u05b0\n\u2018forever\u2019 in (17c) has been pragmatically placed before the main\nsentence, most transparently as a Focus, since it is specific, new\ninformation that also contrasts with the notion of temporality in\nthe previous clauses. Note that the word order is not \u05e5\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05dd\u05dc\u05b8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05dc\u05b0\u05d5\u05bc*\n\u05ea\u05d3\u05b6 \u05de\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05e2 \u2018and forever the earth remains\u2019, which has only a pragmati-\ncally marked Focus. In (17c), the Subject is also placed before the\npragmatically marked Focus, such that it, too, is pragmatically\nmarked as a Topic. The earth is marked as a Topic because it is\nbeing compared to and contrasted with passing generations. Then\nthe main point is brought out with a Focus structure, \u05dd\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05dc\u05b0\n\u2018(remain) forever\u2019, which is pragmatically marked salient\ninformation.\nIt is this mix of interpreting pragmatically positioned infor-\nmation with the need to account for all of the results through rule\nidentification that makes the recognition of pragmatic functions\na powerful tool for practised readers of the biblical text.\n3.1.5. Sentence Marking and Discourse Pragmatics\nThe above examples have illustrated pragmatic functions of\nFocus and Topic (CC) within a V\u2013S perspective. However, 86 Buth\nscholars agree that there are many examples of seemingly insipid\nTopics.15 Many sentences have a fronted constituent that is not\nthe most salient point of a sentence and thus is not a candidate\nfor Focus intonation as a Focus function. Likewise, the constitu-\nent does not provide a contextual comparison or set up a new\nTopic chain. Instead, the Topic introduces an isolated sentence\non its own with interesting Semantics and discourse Pragmatics.\nHornkohl (2018, 44) has summarised the problem:\nFrequently in BH, elements are fronted for purposes of\nmarking something special about the entire clause. Though\nsome formulations of information structure include the\npossibility of whole-clause marking by means of a fronted\nconstituent\u2014for example, Lambrecht\u2019s sentence focus,\nwhich may usefully explain certain cases of preverbal posi-\ntioning in BH\u2014this is inappropriate for the vast majority\nof XV instances in BH in which X is neither topic nor focus.\nWe need to define and identify the \u2018signal\u2019 and then discuss\nproposed meanings or function. A fronted constituent is only\npart of the signal. We can assume that intonation would have\ndistinguished a Focus from a Topic.16 So we may call a fronted\n15 Moshavi (2010, 119) lists over 43% of her examples in Genesis as not\nclearly either Topic or Focus. Atkinson (2021, 227\u201330) lists between\n281 and 451 out of 1,029 examples in Samuel\u2013Kings as being not clearly\nTopic or Focus, which would be 27%\u201344%. He lists 281 examples as\n\u2018thetic\u2019 and 170 as unclear.\n16 Khan and van der Merwe (2020, 361) point out that it is reasonable\nto assume that an intonational distinction existed even if we do not have\naccess to it. Functional Grammar 87\nconstituent for Focus a different signal from a fronted constituent\nfor Topic.\nBut these signals are not alone. They come with an entail-\nment in BH: placing a constituent in front of the verb means that\na wayyiq\u1e6dol verb cannot be used. It means that the functions sig-\nnalled by a wayyiq\u1e6dol verb are blocked. This consideration is vital\nin a small, closed system. Bickerton (1981, 90) points out the\nconstraints of meaning in a closed system, and although his com-\nments are about tense, mood, and aspect, they equally apply to\nany closed system, like wayyiq\u1e6dol V\u2013X order versus X\u2013V orders:\nWe must note a particular characteristic of TMA [tense-\nmood-aspect] systems which, though seemingly obvious,\nhas been ignored by virtually all work up to and including\nComrie\u2019s (1976) influential study of aspect. ... What each\nmarker of modality, tense, or aspect means will be largely\ndetermined by how many markers of these things there are\nin the system and by what each of the others mean.\nThe restrictions of a closed system affect meaning, not just for\nthe structure itself but against the other structures with which it\nis in contrast. The functions of fronted constituents in Hebrew are\nmorpho-syntactically restricted to being non-wayyiq\u1e6dol or non-\nweqa\u1e6dal. These X\u2013V sentences become a signal that expands the\nTopic signal\u2014structurally, a fronted constituent without a Focus\nintonation\u2014into a sentence-level structural signal, rather than\nsimply being a signal for the fronted constituent. The fronted\nconstituent blocks and breaks any continuation of a wayyiq\u1e6dol\nor weqa\u1e6dal. Although a single constituent, it affects the whole\nsentence and becomes a signal for discourse functions of\nvarious kinds of discontinuities: temporal non-sequentiality, 88 Buth\nbackgrounding, and discourse discontinuity (see Hornkohl 2018,\n45\u201351, for examples and discussion).\nKhan and van der Merwe (2020, 349\u201350) agree that dis-\ncourse pragmatics are the primary motivation for these kinds of\nnon-focus, non-topic structures, stating: \u201cWe shall argue that sub-\njective choices concerning discourse structure and organization\nare the ultimate motivations for using thetic sentences.\u201d17 They\nanalyse such X\u2013V sentences as \u2018thetic\u2019, a concept discussed fur-\nther in the next section. But they also define thetic sentences\nnotionally and not uniquely as a structure, saying that \u201cthetic\nsentences may be expressed by constructions other than constitu-\nent fronting and have different contours\u201d (2020, 361).\n3.1.6. Fronting and Thetic Sentences\nThe discussion of thetic sentences is a contribution to Hebrew\nstudies that is congruent to the concept of Background in dis-\ncourse studies, although it comes from a different analysis of\ninformation structure and is broader.18 A thetic sentence \u2018posits\u2019\nthe whole predication without assuming a clear Theme\u2013Rheme\nstructure (also called Topic\u2013Comment, meaning pre-supposed/\nestablished versus salient/non-established information). Proto-\ntypically, a thetic sentence answers a question like \u2018What\nhappened?\u2019, where the whole predication that follows is new\n17 Both Khan and van der Merwe (2020) and Atkinson (2021) link\nfronted non-focal fronted constituents to \u201cthetic sentences.\u201d\n18 The idea of thetic sentences was first proposed in Linguistics by Sige-\nYuki Kuroda (1972) and Hans-J\u00fcrgen Sasse (1987). Functional Grammar 89\ninformation and thus there is little expectation of Theme\u2013Rheme\ninformation structure.\nOne may ask whether thetic sentences are driving the\nHebrew word order or if, within Hebrew, the word order is sig-\nnalling something else that happens to be broadly congruent with\nwhat one might call thetic. A point to remember is that the\nfronted Contextualisation (Topicalisation) breaks any chain of\nwayyiq\u1e6dol clauses or weqa\u1e6dal clauses. In doing that, it is an iconic\nstructure where the fronted constituent provides a discourse-level\nfunction of breaking some continuity that would otherwise have\nbeen implied by a wayyiq\u1e6dol structure. This function of signalling\ndiscontinuity is acknowledged by Atkinson (2021, 119), who says\nthat \u201cthe notion discontinuity correlates well with theticity, in that\na new entity is introduced into the CG [i.e., common ground of\nshared understanding], or an inaccessible event which closes,\ntransitions, or opens discourse units.\u201d\nWe can start to answer our questions from \u00a73.1.5 about\nwhat is driving X\u2013V sentence orders and what the structure is\nsignalling by looking at a few of the prototypical situations that\nwould produce a fully salient thetic information structure.

The relationship between\nthe participle clause and the finite verb clause is the same in (22)\nand (21). In (22), the participle is describing an ongoing progres-\nsive imperfective situation in the future, then the prophet will\nenter at that moment and complete the discussion with the king.\nThe simultaneity is signalled by the CC, which prevents the use\nof the foregrounding weqa\u1e6dal.23\nstory with a foregrounded event. However, the wayyiq\u1e6dol does not have\nthe effect of \u2018just then\u2019 that comes with the discontinuity of the CC +\nqa\u1e6dal.\n23 This is described concisely by Fassberg (2019, 84, translation mine):\n\u201cThe storyline in the Bible advances through continuities of verbs that\nare connected by conversive-waw. The biblical story teller deviates from\nthe continuity (qa\u1e6dal...) wayyiq\u1e6dol... wayyiq\u1e6dol and from the continuity\n(yiq\u1e6dol...) weqa\u1e6dal... weqa\u1e6dal when he wishes to signal to the reader that\nthis does not deal with a direct development in the story line. The sign\nfor stopping the continuity is placing a word before the verb and the\npresentation of the verb without conversive-waw.\u201d 94 Buth\n3.1.7. Pragmatic Effects of Contextualising Constituents\nPractically, the processing for communication follows a simple\norder. If a constituent is placed before a finite Verb, the author\nhas provided a signal for pragmatic effects.24 The audience is led\nto recognise and interpret a special signal. If there is a Focus into-\nnation, it is interpreted as specially marked salient information.\nWithout Focus intonation, the fronted constituent is a Topic/\nContextualisation structure that simultaneously breaks any\nwayyiq\u1e6dol chain. The signal would be easy to perceive, although\nits application would be multivalent.\nThere are many examples where a Focus interpretation is\nruled out and yet an analysis as a prototypical Topic may not be\nreadily apparent:\n(23) (a) \u05d5\u05b9 \u05ea\u05bc\u05e9\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05b8\u05d7\u05b7 \u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05e2\u05d3\u05b7 \u05d9\u05b8 \u05dd\u05d3\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018And the man knew Eve his wife \u2019\n[S\u2013V]\n(b) \u05df \u05d9\u05b4\u05e7\u05b7\u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d3\u05dc\u05b6 \u05ea\u05bc\u05b5 \u05d5\u05b7 \u05e8\u05d4\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05b7 \u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and she conceived and gave birth to Cain\u2019\n(c) \u05d4 \u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05b0\u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05e9\u05d9\u05d0\u05b4 \u05d9\u05ea\u05b4 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05e7\u05b8 \u05e8\u05de\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b9 \u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and said, \u201cI have acquired a man with the Lord.\u201d\u2019\n(Gen. 4.1)\nThe Subject \u05dd\u05d3\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8 \u2018the man\u2019 is not an extended topic of this verse\nor the following verses, nor does this Subject provide any natural\nframework for these immediate verses. In terms of information\nstructure, the whole sentence posits a new situation.25 The\n24 Conjunctions are not included in this statement, as they precede the\nclause in their own special position.\n25 It would probably rightly be classed as thetic by Khan and van der\nMerwe (2020) and Atkinson (2021). Functional Grammar 95\nSubject and Object are equally re-established in this sentence,\nwhich serves as a setting or starting point for the story that fol-\nlows. The Subject is not marked, salient information, so it is not\na Focus in FG terms. But in what sense should \u05dd\u05d3\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8 be called\nTopic?

Within BH, the\nmarked constituent simultaneously breaks the continuity of the\nthematic verb system (sometimes called sequential or consecu-\ntive verbs).26 The Topic/CC sets off the whole sentence with prag-\nmatic marking, and iconically signals some sense of a break in\ncontinuity. Consider (24):\n(24) (a) \u05dd\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4\u05b7 \u05be\u05dc\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05d2\u05b0\u05be\u05d7\u05b7 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05b4 \u05d4\u05b5 \u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018And the Lord threw down a big wind to the sea\u2019\n[S\u2013V]\n(b) \u05dd\u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7 \u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05d2\u05b8\u05be\u05e8\u05e2\u05b7 \u05e1\u05b7 \u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and there was a big storm in the sea\u2019\n(c) \u05e8 \u05d1\u05b5\u05e9\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b0 \u05d4\u05d1\u05b8\u05e9\u05b0 \u05d7\u05b4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d0\u05b3 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018and the boat planned to break apart\u2019 (Jon. 1.4)\n[S\u2013V]\nThe text in (24) shows a similar problem to (23). The Subject\ncomes before the Verb, but it does not make a transparent Topic\nfor the following verses. It is not a Focus, either, since \u2018throwing\n26 These verb categories of wayyiq\u1e6dol in the past/realis/perfective and\nweqa\u1e6dal in the future/irrealis/imperfective are often called sequential\nverbs. However, they do not uniquely entail strict temporal sequential-\nity, nor do they induce their Tense-Mood-Aspect from a previous verb,\nso a more abstract term like thematic may be preferable as providing a\nterm for unit structure and for foregrounding. 96 Buth\ndown a wind\u2019 is really the newest and most salient information\nin the story at this point. The sentence is not answering an\nimplied question (\u2018who threw down a wind?\u2019), but is presenting\nthe wind as a new development, a new setting or scene, but\nwithout using the normal wayyiq\u1e6d ol syntax (... \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d8\u05b6 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d5\u05b7*).\nThese examples, as well as hundreds more, lead to a recog-\nnition that a non-Focal pragmatic positioning can also mark the\nwhole clause as a pragmatic signal for the larger discourse and\nnot just for the constituent itself. For example, Rashi, one of the\noutstanding medieval commentators, suggested that the word\norder at Gen. 4.1 was used to mark a break in the timeline of the\nstory and the conception (and maybe the birth) took place while\nthe couple was still in Eden (see Rashi 1986, 68). Such a sugges-\ntion is possible because choosing a pragmatic function that uses\nfronting prevents the use of the most common narrative struc-\nture, wayyiq\u1e6dol (the thematic past-tense verb). Thus, the prag-\nmatic positioning of pieces of a Hebrew clause is directly linked\nto the verb system.\nHebrew is a language with an interesting information pack-\naging strategy. For over 1,000 years, the language used two bina-\nry, finite verb systems: qa\u1e6dal (past-realis-perfective) versus yiq\u1e6dol\n(future-irrealis-habitual) on the one hand and wayyiq\u1e6dol (past-\nrealis-perfective) versus weqa\u1e6dal (future-irrealis-imperfective) on\nthe other hand, the latter being a \u2018thematic finite verb\u2019 system.\nThe wayyiq\u1e6dol thematic verb system provided a packaging struc-\nture in narrative and past contexts, and the weqa\u1e6dal provided a\nsimilar structural packaging in future contexts, volitional contexts, Functional Grammar 97\nand as continuing habitual sentences in the past.27 The thematic\nverb system requires a V\u2013S order. By contrast, the non-thematic\nsystem has an X\u2013V order. This means that if an author wants to\nuse a non-thematic verb and break a thematic sequence, he must\nuse a pragmatic constituent between a conjunction and the verb.\nIn other words, a Topic (CC) may be used to create a non-\nthematic sentence, as well as to mark a Topic constituent.\nSuch sentences may be used in multiple ways. In their most\nbasic sense, they break the flow of the thematic sentences\n(wayyiq\u1e6dol and weqa\u1e6dal). This structure is chosen to signal a break,\nand the break may be (a) a break in time (whether simultane-\nously or as a flashback); or (b) a break in structure (whether a\nunit boundary with a transitional setting or a parenthetical com-\nment); or simply (c) a break for rhetorical-literary effect. Both\n(23) and (24) can be interpreted as unit boundaries in the dis-\ncourse, as the story time advanced forward in each. Similar situa-\ntions occur in the following exmaples.\n(25) (a) \u05dd \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7 \u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d4\u05e1\u05b8\u05e0 \u05b4 \u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d5\u05b0 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0\u05b5 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05dd\u05d9\u05e8\u05b4 \u05d1\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7 \u05e8\u05d7\u05b7\u05d0\u05b7 \u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018And it happened after these events and God tested\nAbraham \u2019 (Gen. 22.1)\n[S-V]\n(b) \u05dd \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7 \u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05e1 \u05e0\u05b7\u05d9 \u05b0 \u05d5\u05b7 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0\u05b5 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05dd\u05d9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d1\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7 \u05e8\u05d7\u05b7\u05d0\u05b7 \u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d5\u05b7*\nThe word order in (25a) is S\u2013V, where the Subject does not\nappear to be a Focus as the most salient information, nor is it\n27 With a binary verbal system, it should be assumed that the description\nhere is necessarily simplified. A binary tense-mood-aspect finite verb\nsystem must describe most of the distinctions in the world of\ncommunication, including time, modality, and aspect, with only two\nverb forms. 98 Buth\nreadily explained as a Topic. Rather, the whole sentence is set\napart, and here it appears to be like a section heading that\nsummarises the following story in 22:2\u201316. The V\u2013S word order\nin (25b) would make use of the thematic verb system and would\nimply that this is the first foregrounded event that develops the\nstory proper after the time setting \u2018and it happened after these\nevents\u2019. But by using S\u2013V order with a Topic/CC, the author was\nable to signal a discontinuity, setting the whole first sentence\napart and presenting a summary of the whole story.\nSuch a summary sentence can be understood as one of\nmany kinds of literary settings before the development of the\nstory, as in (26):\n(26) (a) \u05d5\u05bc \u05d4\u05b9\u05d1\u05d5\u05b8 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d4\u05b9\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05b8 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b8 \u05e5\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018And the earth was empty chaos\u2019\n(b) \u05dd \u05d5\u05b9\u05d4\u05ea\u05b0 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b5\u05e4\u05b0 \u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05b7 \u05da\u05b0\u05e9\u05b6 \u05b9\u05d7\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018and darkness [was] on the surface of the deep water\u2019\n(c) \u05dd\u05d9\u05b4\u05de\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b7 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b5\u05e4\u05b0 \u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05b7 \u05ea\u05e4\u05b6 \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b7\u05de\u05b0 \u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05d7\u05b7 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018and God\u2019s spirit was hovering over the water surface\u2019\n(d) \u05e8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05b0 \u05dd \u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05dc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b1 \u05e8\u05de\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b9 \u05d9\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and God said \u201cLet there be light,\u201d\u2019\n(e) \u05e8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d0\u05be\u05d9\u05d4\u05b4 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and there was light.\u2019 (Gen. 1.2\u20133)\nIn (26), lines (a) through (c) set the stage for the main event in\n(d) and (e). The S\u2013V order in (26a) avoids a thematic verb and\navoids implying that this is the first main event of the narrative.\nThe whole sentence becomes a setting for the story that follows.\nLikewise, the verbless clause and the participial clause in (b) and\n(c) continue a description of the background setting. They do not\nadvance the events of the story, so they do not use the wayyiq\u1e6dol Functional Grammar 99\nstructure. We thus find a satisfying reading of the authorial\nchoice of S\u2013V order in (26a).\nThe example in (27) provides a similar case:\n(27) \u05d4 \u05de\u05b8 \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05e6\u05b0\u05de\u05b4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05b7\u05d5\u05bc\u05d4 \u05e3\u05e1\u05b5 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018And Joseph had been taken to Egypt\u2019 (Gen. 39.1)\n[S\u2013V]\nThis verse returns the story in Genesis to Joseph and Egypt after\na long, multi-generational hiatus in chapter 38. The S\u2013V order\nmight be called a Topic in order to return to discussing Joseph.\nHowever, it also blocks the thematic, wayyiq\u1e6dol verb system and\nrepeats the action that had already been narrated at Gen. 37.28\nand 36. Therefore, the sentence as a whole marks a chronological\nreordering in the story, conveying a pluperfect sense to the\naudience.\nIn (28), we might try to explain the S\u2013V word order as a\nTopic/CC in order to compare the sailors\u2019 action and Jonah\u2019s\naction.\n(28) \u05dd\u05d3\u05b7\u05e8\u05b8\u05d9\u05b5\u05d5\u05b7 \u05d1\u05db\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b4\u05d5\u05b7 \u05d4\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9\u05e4\u05b4 \u05e1\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7 \u05d9\u05ea\u05b5\u05db\u05b0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b7\u05be\u05dc\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d3\u05e8\u05b7 \u05d9\u05b8 \u05d4\u05e0\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05d5\u05b0\n\u2018And Jonah went down to the back of the ship and lay\n[S\u2013V]\ndown and went into a deep sleep\u2019 (Jon. 1.5b)\nHowever, one should consider that Jonah went below and went\nto sleep before the storm and the actions of the sailors.

However, the second clause in (30b) is also S\u2013V, a\nseemingly unnecessary word order since \u05dd\u05d9\u05e9\u05b4 \u05e0\u05b8\u05d0\u05b2 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d7\u05dc\u05b0 \u05e9\u05c1\u05bb \u05d9\u05b0\u05d5\u05b7* \u2018and the\nmen were sent off\u2019 would have fit normal thematic verbs and\nwould have been expected. The next clause in (30c) is also S\u2013V,\nalso without conjunction, and with the S\u2013V order created by what\nmight be seen as an unnecessary pronoun, since \u05e8 \u05d9\u05e2\u05b4\u05d4\u05b8\u05be\u05ea\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05e6\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d5\u05b7*\nwould have worked fine. The next clause in (30d) is a negative,\nineligible for a thematic wayyiq\u1e6dol verb, and without a conjunc-\ntion. Finally, Joseph\u2019s speech is introduced in (30e) with S\u2013V\ninstead of the usual \u05e8\u05de\u05b6 \u05d0\u05b9 \u05d9\u05d5\u05b7*. The lack of conjunction in (30a) and\n(30c) gives a sense of a double beginning, while the negative\nclause becomes a parenthetical comment. In parallel with this,\nthe avoidance of thematic verbs, despite an appropriate context\nfor them, does not allow the story to progress normally. All of the\nverb forms here \u2018break\u2019 the obvious forward implications of the\nreal-time events. The literary scene appears to have stalled in\nliterary time with all of the actions piled on top of each other. If\nthat is the intended effect of the author, we may call this a rhe-\ntorical use of the pragmatically marked sentences. The story has\npaused with a break extended literarily and syntactically, even 102 Buth\nthough the real time has moved forward.29 In literary terms, we\ncould call this a kind of dramatic pause, perhaps leading to some\nkind of climax. If so, the suspense is held for considerable time,\nsince it is thirty-two verses later, at Gen. 45.3, that Joseph dra-\nmatically reveals himself to his brothers.\nThe idea of a literary and syntactic pause can explain the\nexample above in (24c). One would have expected the thematic\nform \u05e8 \u05d1\u05b5\u05e9\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b0 \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d0\u05b3 \u05d4\u05b8\u05bd\u05b8 \u05d1\u05e9\u05b5 \u05d7\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05b0 \u05d5\u05b7 * \u2018and the boat planned to break apart\u2019.\nHowever, the S\u2013V order and the seemingly unnecessary CC\n(Topic) present a pragmatically marked sentence that breaks the\nforward movement of the unit and story, despite the real world\nadvance in time. It rhetorically and syntactically pauses the story\nat a point of dramatic tension\u2014a dramatic pause. The content, as\nwell, leaves the outcome open-ended and on the verge of disaster.\n3.1.9. Multiple Pragmatic Constituents in Hebrew\nWith multiple pragmatic constituents before the Verb, there is\ntypically a scale from the more presupposed constituent(s), i.e.,\nTopic/CC, to the most salient Focus. Consider (31).\n(31) \u05e2 \u05d3\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d0\u05b2 \u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 \u05e9\u05b8 \u05e4\u05b0 \u05be\u05d9\u05db\u05b4\n\u2018because my sins I myself would recognise\u2019 (Ps.\n[O,Topic] [S,Focus]\n51.5 [7])\nThe syntactic Object of the sentence is \u05d9\u05e2\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8 \u05e4\u05b0 \u2018my rebellious sins\u2019.\nIts position in the sentence can be explained as linking to the sins\nmentioned in other verses, that is, as a Topic function that uses\n29 See, for example, Esth. 7.6\u20138 for a similar long string of non-thematic\nS\u2013V sentences at a climax. Also, Gen. 19.23\u201325 in the description of the\ndestruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Functional Grammar 103\nestablished information to lead into the Comment and newer\ninformation of the sentence. Then, the explicit Subject \u2018I\u2019 is recog-\nnised as pragmatically fronted and as reinforced Focal infor-\nmation that is contra-expected by human nature.\nTo have both constituents before the Verb demands an\nexplanation in an FG approach to a V\u2013S language. In the example\nin (31), the first is a Topic/CC and the second a Focus.\n(32) \u05df\u05ea\u05bc\u05b5 \u05d9\u05b4 \u05d5\u05b9\u05de\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0 \u05d6\u05b9\u05e2 \u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05b0\n\u2018the Lord will give strength TO HIS PEOPLE \u2019\n[CC1] [CC2] [Focus]\n(Ps. 29.11)30\nAn FG approach provides for insightful reading. FG lets the audi-\nence know that there are three pragmatically marked constitu-\nents in (32), culminating in \u2018to his people\u2019. The Psalmist wrote\nthis text to exhort the audience to remain with the people of the\ncovenant, since that is where the blessings of their incomparable\nGod rest. That purpose is reflected in the word order choices.\n3.2. Application to Greek\nIn Greek there are structural, frequency, and complexity dif-\nferences from Hebrew. Nevertheless, the principles of FG and\nmarked information structure pay dividends for those reading\nGreek texts. We can illustrate how pragmatics in FG are helpful\nfor Greek in similar ways, although many of the issues go beyond\nthe scope of a simple article.\n30 \u05d6\u05e2 \u2018str ength\u2019 is also a word of praise from v. 1. There is a crescendo of\nsaliency, leading from the less salient to the more salient. The final,\nmost salient item would receive Focus intonation. 104 Buth\nSeveral obvious differences from Hebrew can be stated at\nthe start. While Hebrew builds texts with finite verb sentences,\nGreek uses much more subordination. Participial phrases hang\non finite-verb sentences seemingly everywhere. Greek has a more\ngranular connective system and uses many more particles in\nshaping and presenting a text. The verbal system in Greek is\nhighly aspectual, requiring users to encode aspect in imperatives,\nsubjunctives, optatives, infinitives, and participles, as well as\nwith finite indicatives in the past.31 In word order, Greek has\nmore flexibility, with words attracted phonologically to phrasal\nHeads (enclitics), phrases split and positioned differently (hyper-\nbaton), flexible orders with Noun + Adjective, and more usage\nof pragmatic functions. However, those pragmatic functions of\nTopic and Focus provide much information to the practised\naudience.\n3.2.1. Greek is V\u2013S\u2013O\nGreek, like Hebrew, was a V\u2013S language, as linguists working\nboth within and outside of FG have concluded.32 Here is a\nsummary from Runge (2010, 189\u201390) in support:\n31 The binary verbal system in Hebrew was more time-mood orientated\nand had difficulty expressing aspect in comparison with Greek. See\nHornkohl (2018); Buth (2019).\n32 Helma Dik (1995, 12) uses a template P1\u2013P\u00d8\u2013V\u2013X. The P1 is prag-\nmatic Topic, the P\u00d8 is Focus, followed by the syntactic template V\u2013X.\nNote that the numbers on the P position are different from those used\nby Runge (2010), although they are referring to the same concepts. Functional Grammar 105\nSimon Dik has proposed that there are two different pre-\nverbal positions that may or may not be filled in any given\nclause, which he calls Position 1 (P1) and Position 2 (P2).\n\u2026 The meaningful distinction between P1 and P2 is based\nlargely upon whether the fronted information is presup-\nposed or newly asserted, respectively.\nOne or more established (i.e., topical) elements of the\nclause may be placed in position P1. These P1 elements\nestablish a new frame of reference,33 creating an explicit\nmental grounding point for the clause that follows. Posi-\ntion P2, on the other hand, is where newly asserted or focal\ninformation is placed.\nDik\u2019s preverbal template is given by Runge (2010, 191) as \u201c(P1)\n(P2) Verb X.\u201d To this we may add another comment from Runge\n(2010, 207):\nKoin\u00e9 Greek is a verb-prominent language, where the least-\nmarked and most basic order of clause components is for\nthe verb to be placed in the initial position. When other\nelements are placed in the initial position, such placement\nis motivated by some pragmatic reason.\n3.2.2. Application to Greek Texts\nThe example in (33) provides a simple example to reinforce the\nclaim that FG can help readers to recognise pragmatic signals\nand, thus, to enhance interpretation skills.\n33 Here Runge footnotes and acknowledges other terminology that\ncovers the same kind of pragmatic function: \u2018topicalisation\u2019\n(Lambrecht), \u2018point of departure\u2019 (Levinsohn), \u2018contextualising\nconstituent\u2019 (Buth). 106 Buth\n(33) \u1f18\u03bd \u03b1\u0313\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u0345\u0342 \u03b7\u0313\u0342\u03bd \u03bf\u0314 \u03bb\u03bf\u0301\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03bf\u0314 \u03bb\u03bf\u0301\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b7\u0313\u0342\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u0300\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u0300\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u0301\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u0300\u03c2 \u03b7\u0313\u0342\u03bd \u03bf\u0314\n\u03bb\u03bf\u0301\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2.\n\u2018In beginning was the Word, and the Word was\n[Topic,X] [Topic,Sub]\nwith God, and the Word was God .\u2019 (John 1.1)\n[Focus,Comp]\nThe whole sentence is technically new because it starts the book.\nHowever, the phrase \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u0313\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u0345\u0342 \u2018in beginning\u2019 is clearly fronted\nbefore the Verb as a non-Focal constituent, and therefore as a\nTopic/CC. It turns out to be the most presupposed information in\nits clause and provides a framework for the rest of the sentence,\neven though it is not the larger topic of the sentence. The clause\nis a Setting, Background, and Thetic. That is why a name like\n\u2018Contextualising Constituent\u2019 for the fronted constituent is more\ntransparent in English than \u2018Topic\u2019 (cf. Runge\u2019s \u2018Frame of refer-\nence\u2019 above). Syntactically, \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u0313\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u0345\u0342 \u2018in beginning\u2019 is an adverbial\ncomplement to the Verb, something labelled \u2018X\u2019 in many of the\ntemplates above. This X has been chosen to function as a broadly\ndefined Topic or CC. In addition, the Subject, \u03bf\u0314 \u03bb\u03bf\u0301\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u2018the word\u2019,\nfollows the Verb and suggests that Greek is a real Verb\u2013Subject\u2013\nObject language. (Obviously, a sample of three clauses can only\nbe an illustration, not a substantive argument.)\nIn the second clause, the phrase \u03bf\u0314 \u03bb\u03bf\u0301\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u2018the word\u2019 can be\ninterpreted as a Topic/CC that marks and establishes the Subject\nas the primary topical link of the clause to the sentence. The\n\u2018word\u2019 is not the new or most salient information of the clause\nand it is not to be read as Focus or with Focal intonation.\nFinally, the phrase \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u0301\u03c2 \u2018God\u2019 is the new, salient information\nof the clause and it comes before the default V\u2013S order, so it is\nclearly marked as Focus. Again, the order of the Subject supports\nthe idea that this is a V\u2013S\u2013O language and not S\u2013V\u2013O. We can try Functional Grammar 107\nto paraphrase the pragmatic signals of the three clauses in\nEnglish: \u2018In the beginning the Word existed. (Let's establish \u2018the\nWord\u2019 as our wider Topic): it was with God, and it was, in fact,\nGod.\u2019 Presumably, the intonation of the Greek sentence would\nreinforce this reading and make the differences between the CC\nand the Focus transparent. All of this can be processed rapidly\nand subliminally by an accomplished reader or audience.\nThese verses in John are uncharacteristically simple for\nGreek, but that makes them good for illustrating how FG allows\na speaker to encode word order and for an audience to interpret\nthe text with the clues of the word order.

All\n[Topic,Sub]\nthings through him came to be, and outside of\n[Topic,Sub] [Focus,X]\nhim came to be nothing that came to be. In him\n[Topic,X] [Topic,X]\nwas life , and the life was the light of\n[Focus,Sub/Comp] [Topic,Sub]\npeople, and the light shines in the darkness\n[Topic,Sub] [Focus,X]\nand the darkness did not comprehend it .\u2019\n[Topic,Sub] [Focus?,Obj]\n(John 1.2\u20135)\nEvery clause makes use of pragmatic functions to help the audi-\nence follow the thoughts and grasp the points.\nThe first clause has a Topic \u03bf\u03c5\u0314\u0342\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u2018this\u2019 that restates items\nfrom the first verse, and the sentence re-establishes the starting\nbase for the points that follow. The second clause may be read in 108 Buth\ntwo ways. As a Topic, \u03c0\u03b1\u0301\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u2018all things\u2019 would introduce items\nthat are assumed to be part of the beginning. The salient,\nimportant point in the clause would be that they came into being\nthrough the Word.34 That salient point \u2018through him, the Word\u2019\nwas placed before the Verb and given prominence as Focus as\nbeing contra-expected. A reader/listener could distinguish these\nTopic and Focus placements through the use of a Focus intona-\ntion. On the other hand, \u03c0\u03b1\u0301\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u2018all things\u2019 is technically newer\ninformation than the pronoun \u2018through it/him\u2019 and it could have\nbeen intended for Focus intonation with \u2018through it/him\u2019 remain-\ning as a Topic. Such an order of Focus\u2013Topic is rare.35 In the next\nclause, the phrase \u2018outside of him\u2019 serves as a Topic that reiterates\nthe idea of the previous clause with default word order.\nThe Word continues to serve as a pragmatic Topic \u2018in him\u2019,\nand the clause introduces marked (i.e., fronted), salient infor-\nmation, \u2018life\u2019, as Focus before the Verb. This begins a chain of\n34 I have translated the pronoun as \u2018him\u2019, even though it refers to an\nabstract noun. That noun isn\u2019t fully personalised until vv. 10\u201318.\n35 A fairly unambiguous example of Focus before marked Topic occurs\nat Gal. 3.2, \u1f10\u03be \u03b5\u0313\u0301\u03c1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u03bd\u03bf\u0301\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u0300 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u0342\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u0301\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b7\u0313\u0300 \u1f10\u03be \u03b1\u0313\u03ba\u03bf\u03b7\u0342\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b9\u0301\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2; \u2018Did you\nreceive the spirit from works of law or from hearing of faith?\u2019 The\nphrases \u1f10\u03be \u03b5\u0313\u0301\u03c1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u03bd\u03bf\u0301\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u2018from works\u2019 and \u1f10\u03be \u03b1\u0313\u03ba\u03bf\u03b7\u0342\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b9\u0301\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u2018from hearing of\nfaith\u2019 are the Focal question constituents. However, \u2018from works \u2019\n[Focus]\ncomes before the Topical Object \u03c4\u03bf\u0300 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u0342\u03bc\u03b1 \u2018Spirit \u2019.

So \u03c0\u03b1\u0301\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 is functionally\n[Sub,Topic] [X,Focus]\nambiguous and could have been read with two intonations. Functional Grammar 109\nclauses in which any salient information becomes a marked Topic\nin the following clause.\nOne tricky point of reading comes in the last clause. There\nmay be two marked Topics in the clause \u2018and the darkness, it, did\nnot comprehend\u2019. Both \u2018darkness\u2019 and \u2018it [the light]\u2019 appear to be\npre-supposed, established, topical constituents and may not\nreceive any special reinforcement, therefore without focal intona-\ntion, leaving the negated Verb as most salient. So, although there\nare two pragmatic constituents before the Verb, there is no Focus\nconstituent marked by word order. Alternatively, \u2018it\u2019 may be read\nwith Focal intonation for a coming contrast with \u2018him\u2019 in verse\n10.\n4.0. Prospects for Further Application\nFunctional Grammar helps identify pragmatic markings in a lan-\nguage. Learning to identify pragmatic material in texts is a gate-\nway to a wider world, whether in linguistic, literary, or biblical\nstudies in particular.\nSome researchers may want to work directly in the field of\nformalising grammar and knowledge about human language and\nthe iterations that are found in Biblical Hebrew and ancient\nGreek. Many questions remain for formalising syntax. This is true\nfor linguistics in general and for FG. Areas like the linguistic side\nof FG, word order, or discourse analysis and pragmatics in either\nHebrew or Greek continue to develop. There is a continuum from\nstudying how stories are constructed all the way down to the nuts\nand bolts of a language. Functional linguistics is poised to address\nthat challenge. At the end of the day, these are tools that are used 110 Buth\nfor describing and understanding messages in both their structure\nand their meaning. Research and understanding in both Hebrew\nand Greek literatures are enhanced as one develops a sensitivity\nto the pragmatic signals and language choices that are woven\ninto every sentence in a text.\n5.0.

COGNITIVE LINGUISTIC THEORY AND\nTHE BIBLICAL LANGUAGES1\nWilliam A. Ross\nStudy of the Bible has always involved study of its languages. But\nthe study of language has not always involved linguistic theory\nas such. It has only been over the past sixty years or so that\nwestern biblical scholarship has begun to appropriate and apply\ninsights from general linguistics to better understand the ancient\ntexts. Over that time, the bulk of linguistically-informed biblical\nlanguage research has adopted formalist linguistic theories, such\nas structuralism or generativism.2 This trend is due in part to the\n1 I am grateful to Elizabeth Robar, Travis Wright, and my two peer\nreviewers for their useful input on earlier versions of this chapter. My\nthanks go to Joey Hyatt for his capable research assistance preparing\nthe bibliography.\n2 Taylor (2002, 4\u20135) concisely explains formalist approaches as those\nthat \u201cregard a language as a self-contained system, whose properties are\nencapsulated in a Grammar, i.e. a device which generates, or defines,\nthe set of well-formed sentences which constitute the language. A\ngeneral feature of formalist approaches is to regard a language as a\ndisembodied object, which is independent, as it were, of the speakers\nwho use it and the purposes for which they use it.\u201d More specifically\nwith reference to mainstream generativism, \u2018formal\u2019 tends to mean\n\u00a9 2023 William A. Ross, CC BY-NC 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358.03 118 Ross\nfact that formalist theories are older and better known in com-\nparison with the alternatives. But it is also due to the tendency\nof interdisciplinary research never to be truly up-to-date on all\nfronts. That being the case, it is only in the last twenty years that\nbiblical scholarship has come into direct contact with Cognitive\nLinguistics, a topic that is the focus of this chapter.\n1.0. The History of Cognitive Linguistics\nIt is important to understand at the outset that Cognitive Lin-\nguistics is not a unified field of research. It is, as Geeraerts\n(2006b, 2) puts it, \u201can archipelago rather than an island,\u201d one\nwhose members are described below (cf. Geeraerts and Cuyckens\n2007a, 5\u20136). Even so, Cognitive Linguistics is a research perspec-\ntive that is characterised by several key theoretical commitments\nconcerning language, and these commitments do grant coherence\nand unity to the discipline as a whole, if not total uniformity. As\ndiscussed further below, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s\nthat major developments\u2014and controversies\u2014in general lin-\nguistics at large created the necessary conditions from which the\nfoundational pillars of Cognitive Linguistic theory would begin\nto emerge. But to understand why and how that happened\nrequires a broader historical perspective than one might expect.\nCognitive Linguistics is not unique among theories for its\nfocus on language as a mental phenomenon. Generativism, for\nexample, is also \u2018cognitive\u2019 in a basic sense, in that it attributes a\nexplicit, non-embodied, and rationalist, which makes semantics describ-\nable with abstract, rule-governed predicate logic. Cognitive Linguistics 119\nmental status to language.3 But Cognitive Linguistics does rep-\nresent the revival of interest among linguists in the meaning-\nbearing function of language for communication alongside its\npsychological character. In other words, Cognitive Linguistic\ntheory is interested not only in knowledge of a language, but also\nin language as a form of knowledge, even an \u201cintegral part of\ncognition\u201d itself (Janda 2015, 131). For most of the twentieth\ncentury, this kind of outlook had receded entirely from view in\nlinguistic theorising, in favour of an almost exclusive focus on\nextrapolating abstract structures or rules taken to account for\nlanguage as a self-contained system. But it was not always so.\n1.1. Early Modern Foundations\nLinguistics emerged as a scientific discipline\u2014if one wishes to\nuse such terminology\u2014in the nineteenth century, as it became\ndistinct from the older and broader practices of philology.4 This\nwas the era of diachronic, comparative linguistics.5 In many\n3 Hence the capitalisation of \u2018Cognitive Linguistics\u2019 as a point of distinc-\ntion from other theoretical approaches that also consider cognitive\naspects of language (Siewierska 2013, 485 n. 1).\n4 Linguists themselves disagree over whether and how linguistics can be\nconsidered a \u2018science\u2019, properly speaking. Harris (1993, 11) satisfyingly\ndismisses such bickering, saying that linguistics \u201cis some sort of system-\natic, truth-seeking, knowledge-making enterprise, and as long as it\nbrings home the epistemic bacon by turning up results about language,\nthe label [\u2018science\u2019] isn\u2019t terribly important.\u201d\n5 Diachronic study looks at the development of phenomena over time,\nas compared with synchronic study, which looks at phenomena within\na specific point or period of time. 120 Ross\nways, this phase of language study and its particular methods\narrived upon the broader tide of historical reconstruction and\ncomparativism that was rising throughout the academy at large\nin this period (De Maurio and Formigari 1990; Bod 2013, 143\u2013\n83). Scholars tirelessly sought parallels in sound-meaning pairs\nas a way to chart the history of what would come to be known as\nthe Indo-European language family.\nAlthough many of their conclusions have stood the test of\ntime remarkably well, nineteenth-century comparative linguists\nwere also prone to indulging in wild speculation (see Eco 1995).\nThese scholars were heirs to the old notion that languages are\nlinked to the thought patterns of the people who use them\n(Robins 1997, 152\u2013206). Some took this idea down dark, more\ndeterministic pathways in the intensifying atmosphere of Roman-\ntic nationalism in fin de si\u00e8cle Europe (see Olender 1992; Turner\n2014, 125\u201346; Joseph 2020, 145\u201363). But at a general level, most\nscholars viewed the study of language as concerned with com-\nmunication and also as a corollary in some way to the study of\nthe mind and therefore to all of human society. Language was\nunderstood as essentially psychological and thus imbricated with\nhuman experience (Campbell 2003, 93\u201394; Geeraerts 2010, 9\u2013\n16).\n1.2. Formalist Peregrinations\nThe study of language changed shape at the turn of the twentieth\ncentury. Perhaps the most important bellwether was the post-\nhumous appearance of the Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale by\nFerdinand de Saussure (1857\u20131913) in 1916, which set out to Cognitive Linguistics 121\ndefine the task of linguistics. Saussure\u2019s work had lasting effects.\nOne was to reorientate linguistic inquiry away from diachronic\nquestions of historical reconstruction, which had predominated\nprevious scholarship, towards synchronic questions. Another was\nto move away from viewing language as a social phenomenon.\nInstead, Saussure distinguished linguistic behaviour (parole) from\nthe supposed abstract system underlying it (langue). Only the\nlatter was the proper object of linguistic research, understood as\na self-contained system of interrelated signs.\nThis basic outlook became the foundation of structuralism\nas it took root in America in the work of Franz Boas (1858\u20131942),\nEdward Sapir (1884\u20131939), and especially Leonard Bloomfield\n(1887\u20131949). It was the latter in particular who dispensed with\nthe mind as entirely irrelevant to linguistic inquiry and descrip-\ntion. Bloomfieldian structuralism as it was articulated in his 1933\nLanguage was highly systematic and method-orientated, position-\ning itself as having no overlap with other disciplines. Behav-\niourist theory helped justify the anti-psychological posture of\nstructuralism, which instead focused on creating mechanisms to\nempirically verify linguistic descriptions of phonology and mor-\nphology. Ultimately, structuralism came to be entirely about the\nsignifier but not at all about the signified; always the winter of\ngrammar but never the Christmas of meaning. The latter was\nmessy and much better left to the psychologists or sociologists\n(Bloomfield 1933, 140; cf. Harris 1993, 16\u201328; Robins 1997,\n222\u201359; Campbell 2003, 95-100).\nThe face of linguistics changed again in the mid-twentieth\ncentury as the empiricist outlook of structuralism began to give 122 Ross\nway to the new theoretical paradigm developed by Noam\nChomsky (1923\u2013), the intellectual progenitor of transformational\n(later generative) grammar. The history and key commitments of\ngenerativism are recounted elsewhere in this volume (Naud\u00e9 and\nMiller-Naud\u00e9) and need not be given in any detail here (see also\nBlevins 2013; Freidin 2013). But with Chomsky, linguistics\nbecame rationalist once again, turning attention back to the\nrelationship between language and the mind. In broad strokes,\nChomsky\u2019s approach focused on syntax and aimed to articulate\nthe formal principles that describe how the mind of a speaker\ngenerates grammatical sentences given the parameters of a spe-\ncific language. These principles were understood as being both\nuniversal across all languages and innate in the human mind.\nGenerativism remained the predominant linguistic framework for\nmost of the twentieth century, certainly in North America and in\nmany cases elsewhere, until a theoretical parting of ways\noccurred in the 1980s (Robins 1997, 260\u201363; Campbell 2003,\n100\u201303).6\n1.3. Cognitive Realisations\nThe advent of Cognitive Linguistics is linked with a broader\nmovement away from formalist theories that is known as func-\ntionalism (see Buth in this volume). Although generativism is\ninterested in cognitive aspects of language as a system for\nexpressing thought, it also gives little to no attention to the\n6 It is probably correct to say that generativism is still the dominant\nlinguistic framework today, although only in certain areas, especially\nsyntax. Cognitive Linguistics 123\ncommunicative purpose of language, and intentionally so.7 This\norientation is not unique to generativism but can be traced back\nto Saussure\u2019s disinterest in parole in favour of langue. By contrast,\nfunctionalist theories focus on language as a means of commu-\nnication and how grammar arises from use of the language. Func-\ntional and Cognitive Linguistics have distinct but very much\noverlapping histories, such that linguists disagree as to whether\nand how the latter is properly understood as part of the former\n(see Van Valin Jr. 2003; Nuyts 2010). Still, the two labels identify\na set of theoretical frameworks that are rightly understood as\nfellow travellers on a road that has departed from the highway\nof generativism.\nThat departure was complete by the late 1980s, after over\na decade of increasingly heated controversy within Chomskyan\ncircles over theoretical developments known as Generative\nSemantics.8 Certain participants in the debate were increasingly\ndissatisfied with the level of abstract restrictiveness that genera-\ntivism had reached. In contrast to this formalism, the Cognitive\n7 In the words of Chomsky (2002, 76\u201377): \u201cLanguage is not properly\nregarded as a system of communication. It is a system for expressing\nthought, something quite different.\u201d Another example is Chafe (1994,\n8; quoted in Ariel 2010, 76), who states that \u201cthere are many important\nthings about language that can never be understood by constructing\nsequences of words that begin with John and end with a period, and\nasking oneself whether or not they are sentences of English.\u201d Cited in\nAriel (2010, 76). My thanks to Travis Wright for drawing my attention\nto these quotes.\n8 See the lively history by Harris (1993), now updated in an excellent\nsecond edition (2021). 124 Ross\nLinguistic and functionalist approaches agreed that language is\nnot an autonomous mental system but rather is integrated with\nhuman cognition as a whole.9 One of the leading figures advanc-\ning this idea in the Cognitive Linguistics movement was George\nLakoff (1941\u2013), who in 1987 published one of the seminal texts\nin Cognitive Linguistics, entitled Women, Fire, and Dangerous\nThings. It was in that same year that Ronald W. Langacker\n(1942\u2013) published Foundations of Cognitive Grammar, which\nwould become another foundational text for Cognitive Linguis-\ntics, alongside The Body in the Mind by Mark Johnson (1987). As\ndiscussed in the next section, these texts and others soon to fol-\nlow set out key theoretical commitments, largely in direct con-\ntrast to generativism, that make Cognitive Linguistics uniquely\ncentred on the nature of linguistic meaning as part of human\ncognition as a whole. Today, Cognitive Linguistics is widely rec-\nognised as one of the major frameworks in theoretical linguistics\nas a discipline, and it continues to grow in popularity and appli-\ncation in numerous venues around the world (Taylor 2007, 566\u2013\n71, 574\u201376; Nerlich and Clarke 2010, 590\u201392; see also Howe and\nSweetser 2013, 123\u201324).10\n9 In generativism specifically, language is handled as a separate module\nwithin the human mind that is unconnected from other cognitive abili-\nties, hence it is fundamentally disembodied.\n10 For a more in-depth discussion of the origins of Cognitive Linguistics,\nsee Ross (forthcoming). Cognitive Linguistics 125\n2.0. Key Theoretical Commitments and Major\nConcepts\nCognitive Linguistics as it has developed over the last forty years\nis focused on understanding the communicative function of lan-\nguage, specifically in terms of the experiential basis for struc-\ntured relationships that exist between language and cognition. At\na basic level, Cognitive Linguistics views language as a dynamic\nbut shared repertoire of form-meaning pairings used to symboli-\ncally encode and transmit thought to others. Language in this\nsense involves a \u201crepository of world knowledge, a structured\ncollection of meaningful categories that help us deal with new\nexperiences and store information about old ones\u201d (Geeraerts and\nCuyckens 2007a, 5).\n2.1. Four Commitments\nFour key theoretical commitments characterise Cognitive Lin-\nguistics as a whole and help bear out its view of language. The\ndescriptions of these commitments below are brief and abstract,\nbut are illustrated further below with the six concepts that flow\nout of them.\n2.1.1. Language Arises from Embodied Cognition\nCognitive Linguistics hypothesises that the human mind has no\nautonomous or innate faculty of some kind where language pro-\ncessing occurs, separate from other cognitive processes, which is\na basic assumption in Chomskyan generative grammar. Instead,\nCognitive Linguistics maintains that linguistic knowledge is rep-\nresented in the mind and processed in basically the same way as 126 Ross\nall other conceptual structures. Linguistic knowledge\u2014the pair-\ning of form and meaning\u2014is therefore conceptual, an integral\npart of cognition in general, and organised and governed in the\nsame ways as the cognitive abilities that are applied in other\nbodily tasks such as visual perception and sensorimotor activity.\nLanguage is distinguishable as a cognitive ability, but it is not\nunique in terms of the mental processes that are involved. An\nimportant corollary of this view of cognition is that linguistic\nmeaning itself is embodied\u2014not purely rational\u2014since it reflects\nhuman experience in the world (Croft and Cruse 2004, 2\u20133;\nGeeraerts 2006b, 4\u20135; Janda 2015, 132\u201333).11\n2.1.2. Language is Perspectivised\nA fundamental commitment of Cognitive Linguistic theory is that\nconceptual structure\u2014and thus also linguistic knowledge\u2014is not\nreducible to mere truth-conditional correspondence to the exter-\nnal world. Rather, language bears meaning because it construes\nthe world in a perspectivised, embodied way, imposing a struc-\nture upon it rather than just reflecting objective reality.12 So in\n11 For example, in his discussion of the word grasp from a cognitive\nscientific perspective, Feldman (2008, 166) explains how \u201cthe embod-\nied neural approach to language suggests that the complex neural\ncircuitry that supports [the physical action of] grasping is the core\nmeaning of the word.\u201d\n12 A basic example would be the word sunset, which only bears meaning\n(indeed only exists within language) because of the physical organisa-\ntion of external objects relative to human perception. Note that this\ncommitment does not entail an endorsement of philosophical relativ-\nism. From its earliest stages, theorists within the Cognitive Linguistic Cognitive Linguistics 127\nCognitive Linguistics, conceptual structure is likewise subject to\nconstrual in its organisation and how categories are formed. To\narticulate this commitment another way, grammar is conceptu-\nalisation, since linguistic structure reflects conceptual structure.13\nCognitive Linguistics thus maintains that language provides vari-\nous ways of portraying and profiling the information being com-\nmunicated (Croft and Cruse 2004, 1, 3; Geeraerts 2006b, 4; Evans\nand Green 2006, 40\u201343).\n2.1.3. Language is Symbolic\nCognitive Linguistic theory emphasises the primacy of meaning\nin linguistic analysis by assuming that the basic function of lan-\nguage is to express thought and therefore must involve meaning,\nincluding pragmatic meaning. The way language expresses\nthought is by using symbols, which consist of forms\u2014whether\nspoken, written, or even signed\u2014and meanings with which the\nforms are paired by convention. Linguistic symbols bear meaning\nthat is associated not with a particular referent in the external\nworld, but rather with a concept or mental representation, which\nitself is derived from categorisation of our experience in the\nmovement have argued against both foundationalism and relativism, as\nfor example in Johnson (1987, 194\u2013212). He argues (202) that \u201cwe are\nin touch with our world but always in a mediated fashion. There is thus\nno single, God\u2019s-Eye way of carving up the world. But it does not follow\nfrom this that we can carve it up any way we wish.\u201d See also Harder\n(2007, esp. 1253).\n13 Moreover, linguistic utterances are meant to elicit a shared concep-\ntual structure between speakers. 128 Ross\nexternal world. Notably, because Cognitive Linguistics hypothe-\nsises that linguistic cognition is indistinct from cognition in gen-\neral (the first commitment), categorisation occurs not only with\nphysical entities but also with language itself. As a result, linguis-\ntic phenomena are not strictly divided into the traditional \u2018levels\u2019\nof phonology, morphology, syntax, and so on. Rather, language\nis viewed as a unified phenomenon for which these terms serve\nas convenient labels for what are in reality overlapping catego-\nries. (Evans and Green 2006, 6\u20137, 28\u201330; Geeraerts and Cuyckens\n2007a, 5).\n2.1.4. Language is the Conventions of Use\nAs noted above, Cognitive Linguistics shares with functionalism\nits focus on language as a means of communication and actual\nusage events among speakers. In Cognitive Linguistic theory,\nknowledge of language is understood to emerge from use, such\nthat the abstraction of linguistic categories and structures by\nlanguage learners and users occurs inductively. On this view, a\nlanguage is nothing more than the set of form-meaning pairings\nused by convention in a speech community (Croft 2000, 26, 95\u2013\n99).14 Those form-meaning pairings, moreover, occur at every\nlevel of language, from morpheme all the way up to syntax and\neven discourse. A corollary of this commitment is the unpre-\ndictability of language owing to variability in usage events over\ntime, which leads to language change. Language change occurs\n14 Cognitive Linguistics tends to use the term \u2018utterance\u2019 for communica-\ntion usage events, which are understood as particular, actual instances\nof spoken or written forms by a language user (Evans 2007, 217\u201318). Cognitive Linguistics 129\nnot only because speakers themselves change, but because the\nexternal world does, too (Croft 1990, 257). At the same time,\nlanguage change is not considered unpredictable. Although\nCognitive Linguistics is not interested in uncovering linguistic\nuniversals in the same sense as in formalist theories, it does\nacknowledge universal tendencies in human language use that\nare constrained and motivated by shared cognitive abilities and\nprocesses, and therefore result in similar patterns of diachronic\nchange across languages (Croft and Cruse 2004, 3\u20134, 71\u201373;\nGeeraerts 2006b, 4, 5\u20136).15\n2.2. Six Concepts\nIn addition to these four key theoretical commitments in Cogni-\ntive Linguistic theory, there are numerous concepts that flow\nfrom them. While there are more than space allows for here, the\nsix concepts discussed below are widely considered central to\nCognitive Linguistics as a framework for the study of language.\nIn anticipation of the next section, each concept discussed here\nis illustrated with reference to the biblical text and languages.\n2.2.1. Image Schemas\nSince Cognitive Linguistics understands conceptual structure to\nbe grounded in embodiment, semantic structure is reckoned the\nsame way. That is what it means for language to be embodied. In\nother words, part of what makes language meaningful is the\n15 On grammaticalisation theory, see especially Narrog and Heine\n(2011), Hopper and Traugott (2012), and Kouteva et al. (2019). 130 Ross\nhuman embodied experience with which it is associated.16 One of\nthe foundational ways of illustrating and accounting for this\nconceptual association between embodied experience and lin-\nguistic meaning is what Cognitive Linguistics calls the image\nschema, originally developed by Johnson (1987). According to\nSullivan (2017, 398), image schemas are \u201csimple cognitive struc-\ntures that represent spatial configurations independently of a\nsingle sensory modality.\u201d They arise directly from repeated sen-\nsory interactions with the world, including the visual, auditory,\nhaptic (touch), and vestibular (balance) systems of the body.\nImage schemas are not detailed ideas, but are rather abstract or\n\u2018schematic\u2019 in nature (hence the name), and thus provide a foun-\ndation for richer conceptual and semantic structures. In this\nsense, image schemas are pre-conceptual and subconscious.17\nTo label and describe image schemas, Cognitive Linguistics\nuses SMALL CAPITALS and simple diagrams, respectively. For exam-\nple, because the human body has a unidirectional visual appa-\nratus (i.e., eyes that look in one direction), axial orientation is\ninherently part of embodied experience. This simple reality of\nhuman embodiment gives rise to a number of image schemas,\n16 Or, as Evans and Green (2006, 158\u201360) put it, \u201cSemantic structure is\nconceptual structure,\u201d and conceptual structure is embodied.\n17 In a series of studies, Mandler (1988; 1992; 1996; 2005; 2010) has\nshown how image schemas arise in conjunction with physical and psy-\nchological development during early childhood (even in the womb)\nthrough what she calls perceptual meaning analysis. See also Evans\n(2014, esp. 118\u201326; 2015, 122\u201353). Cognitive Linguistics 131\nsuch as FRONT-BACK, LEFT-RIGHT, and\u2014given the universal expe-\nrience of gravity and three-dimensional space\u2014UP-DOWN and\nNEAR-FAR as well. These image schemas are interconnected in\nhuman visual experience, as are many others. For example,\nFigure 1 shows the CONTAINER image schema at the far left. The\ndiagrams in the centre and at right involve the CONTAINER image\nschema as well, but do so as part of the related image schemas\nfor IN and OUT, respectively.18\nFigure 1: Image schemas for CONTAINER, IN, and OUT\nLM LM LM\nTR TR\nNote too the use of \u2018LM\u2019 and \u2018TR\u2019 in Figure 1, which stand for\n\u2018Landmark\u2019 and \u2018Trajector\u2019, respectively. These terms refer to\nelements that are related in any given construal, but are profiled\nin different ways as either focal (Trajector/TR) or non-focal\n(Landmark/LM). For example, in the centre diagram, the TR\nentity is IN the CONTAINER LM, while in the right diagram the TR\nis OUT (Evans and Green 2006, 176\u201391; Gibbs and Colston 2006;\nEvans 2007, 106\u201308; Oakley 2007).19\n18 Other image schemas that CONTAINER helps to structure could be\nelaborated, such as TOP-BOTTOM, OVER-UNDER, and FULL-EMPTY, etc.\n19 There are numerous image schemas that Cognitive Linguistics has\ncollectively identified, although these are not exclusive of others that\nmay be proposed. See Evans (2019, 235\u201336) for a synthesised list. 132 Ross\nThe notion of an image schema may seem simple, but\nbecause it helps analyse conceptual structures it also has signifi-\ncant explanatory power for linguistic structures, as illustrated in\nthe clauses in example (1) below.\n(1) (a) \u05e8 \u05d9\u05e2\u05b4 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05be\u05df\u05de\u05b4 \u05d4\u05e0\u05b8\u05d5\u05b9 \u05d9 \u05d0\u05e6\u05bc\u05b5 \u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018Then Jonah went out of the city\u2019\n(b) \u05e8 \u05d9\u05e2\u05b4 \u05dc\u05b8 \u05dd\u05d3\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05c1\u05b6 \u05de\u05b4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05c1\u05b6 \u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and sat east of the city,\u2019\n(c) \u05d4 \u05db\u05b8 \u05e1\u05bb \u05dd\u05e9\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b9\u05dc \u05e9\u05c2\u05e2\u05b7\u05d9\u05b7\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018and he made a booth there for himself.\u2019\n(d) \u05dc \u05e6\u05bc\u05b5 \u05d1\u05b7 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05d9\u05ea\u05c1\u05b6 \u05d7\u05b0 \u05ea\u05b7 \u05d1\u05e9\u05c1\u05b6 \u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018And he sat under it in the shade\u2019 (Jon. 4.5a)\nIn (1a) Jonah is a TR that is portrayed as OUT of the boundaries\nof the city, which itself is construed as a CONTAINER LM. In addi-\ntion, the verbal event in (1a) is structured by the SOURCE-PATH\nimage schema that involves linear motion. Similarly, Jonah\u2019s\nresting place \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7\u05de \u2018east\u2019 of the city in (1b) involves a CENTRE-\nPERIPHERY image schema in which the city is construed as central\nand Jonah\u2019s spatial position in (1b) as peripheral to the scene.\n(As discussed in more detail in \u00a72.2.5 below, the geographical\nsense \u2018east\u2019 for \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7\u05de arises from a FRONT-BACK image schema\ninvolved in the semantic structure of the word.) In (1d), Jonah is\nagain a TR, but now profiled against two LMs, one being the\nbooth as an elevated SURFACE under which Jonah sits and the\nother being the shade produced by the booth as a CONTAINER in\nwhich Jonah is located.20\n20 Note, too, that utterances involve perspective or situatedness in the\nspatial construal (Croft and Cruse 2004, 58\u201363). In (1) the construal is Cognitive Linguistics 133\n2.2.2. Frame Semantics\nAn important aspect of the commitment to embodied cognition\nin Cognitive Linguistic theory is the related thesis that meaning\nis encyclopedic in nature. That is, semantic structure (form/\nmeaning pairing) is inextricably linked\u2014in fact it is understood\nto \u2018grant access\u2019\u2014to a complex inventory of structured know-\nledge about the world. That knowledge is encyclopaedic in that\nit derives from both physical and sociocultural dimensions of\nhuman experience.21 The theories of Frame Semantics and Con-\nceptual Domains are two approaches in Cognitive Linguistics to\nextrapolate this understanding of linguistic meaning. These theo-\nries are distinct, but in many ways complementary. This section\nfocuses on Frame Semantics, leaving Conceptual Domains aside\nuntil the next section.22\nA semantic frame is a schematisation of experience that\nis represented conceptually and held in long-term memory. In\nessence, a frame is a knowledge structure of interrelated concepts\nassociated with an identifiable, culturally-embedded scene in\nhuman experience. Frames contribute to meaning construction\nby virtue of their gestalt quality. That is, without knowledge of\nthe relationship structure of the frame as a whole, knowledge of\nallocentric, taking a kind of bird\u2019s-eye view of the scene, rather than a\n\u2018Jonah\u2019s-eye view\u2019. On the typological diversity of spatial models of\nconstrual, see for example Mawyer and Feinberg (2014).\n21 As van Wolde (2009, 51\u2013103) puts it, words are \u201ctips of encyclopedic\nicebergs.\u201d\n22 Frame Semantics originated with Fillmore (1982; 1985), while Con-\nceptual Domains were developed by Langacker (1987). 134 Ross\nany given concept within it is incomplete. Fillmore (2006, 373)\nmakes this same point, explaining that a frame is \u201cany system of\nconcepts related in such a way that to understand any one of\nthem you have to understand the whole structure in which it fits;\nwhen one of the things in such a structure is introduced into a\ntext, or into a conversation, all of the others are automatically\nmade available.\u201d For example, the concept associated with the\nword \u2018Monday\u2019 is linked to, prompts, and can only be fully under-\nstood within the frame WEEK, which is simpler and more basic\nthan its parts.23 Although frames are basic modes of knowledge\nrepresentation in this sense, they are not static. Rather, a frame\nis updated, modified, and adapted on the basis of ongoing experi-\nence (see further Evans and Green 2006, 206\u201347; Ungerer and\nSchmid 2006, 207\u201318; Cienki 2007; Evans 2007, 85\u201386).\nUnderstanding frame semantics comes more easily by illus-\ntration. In CL, a semantic frame is denoted using SMALL CAPITALS,\nmuch like an image schema. So, for example, the BAKING frame\nincludes categories for at least one participant, the BAKER, who is\nin the BAKING role working with elements like INGREDIENTS and\nTOOLS that themselves have properties like WET, DRY, SHARP, and\nHOT. In an ancient Greek context, the BAKING frame provides the\nbackground and motivation for categories associated with words\nlike \u03c3\u03b5\u03bc\u1f77\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (\u2018fine flour\u2019), \u03b6\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b7 (\u2018leaven\u2019), \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u1f71\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9 (\u2018to knead\u2019),\n\u03c6\u1f7b\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 (\u2018dough\u2019), \u03ba\u03bb\u1f77\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (\u2018oven\u2019), and \u1f04\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (\u2018bread loaf\u2019).\n23 I am grateful to one of my peer reviewers for his helpful illustration. Cognitive Linguistics 135\nAn interesting example of the BAKING semantic frame at\nwork appears in Matthew 16.

He cautions his disciples against \u1f21\n\u03b6\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b7 (\u2018the leaven\u2019) of their religious opposition. In (2c) the dis-\nciples, having no bread with them but hearing Jesus mention\n\u03b6\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b7, become confused. Understanding how words grant access\nto semantic frames that structure encyclopaedic knowledge helps\naccount for that confusion, as the word \u03b6\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b7 naturally prompts\nthe BAKING frame, although that is not the right frame for under-\nstanding Jesus\u2019 warning. The preceding events involving bread\nand the disciples\u2019 ongoing mental preoccupation with having 136 Ross\nforgotten to bring any on their journey further explain their ini-\ntial (mis)interpretation in (2c) of Jesus\u2019 words in (2b). But as seen\nin (2d), Jesus\u2019 comment is in fact not straightforwardly about\nbread, but rather about teaching. The connections between those\ntwo ideas are extensive and rich, as are the implications, and they\nare explored in more detail in \u00a72.2.4 below. Before doing that,\nhowever, another major concept within Cognitive Linguistics\nneeds explanation.24\n2.2.3. Domains and Conceptual Metaphor\nOne of the best-known parts of Cognitive Linguistics as a whole\nis conceptual metaphor theory, originally developed by Lakoff\nand Johnson (1980; see Tay 2014).25 In essence, the theory holds\nthat metaphor in language is no mere stylistic or rhetorical fea-\nture, but in fact helps to structure cognition and meaning itself\nvia embodied experience. Conceptual metaphor involves two\ndomains, a source and a target, the former being mapped or \u2018pro-\njected\u2019 unidirectionally onto the latter such that richer or more\ncomplex meaning arises through correspondence. A domain is\n24 Further illustration of frame semantics for Hebrew appears in Ziegert\n(2021, 29\u201331) and de Blois (2004). See also the application of frame\nsemantics to English available online at https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.\nedu, accessed 29 June 2023, which also offers a very useful glossary of\nterms.\n25 Cognitive Linguistics has also proposed a theory of metonymy, which\nis not outlined here for reasons of space, though some have proposed\nmetonymy as an even more basic cognitive process than metaphor. See\nCroft (2006); Evans and Green (2006, 310\u201327); Polzenhagen et al.\n(2014). Cognitive Linguistics 137\nsimilar to a semantic frame, as discussed above, but is not neces-\nsarily associated with experience of a particular scene. Rather,\ndomains are cognitive entities of varying levels of complexity and\norganisation that provide background information against which\na concept is understood. Typically, concepts are structured with\nmultiple domains in a kind of matrix.\nSome domains are basic, deriving directly from embodied\nexperience, and are thus pre-conceptual. As such, basic domains\nare similar to image schemas, but the latter are built upon the\nformer, which are also not necessarily imagistic. Examples of\nbasic domains, which again are denoted in Cognitive Linguistics\nusing SMALL CAPITALS, would include SPACE, TEMPERATURE, TIME,\nVOLUME, and COLOUR, among others (see further in Evans and\nGreen 2006, 234\u201335). These domains often provide the source in\npervasive conceptual metaphors that structure linguistic mean-\ning, but more complex domains may also appear. What makes\nthese conceptual and not merely rhetorical metaphors is their\nmotivation and usefulness at the level of thought itself. Several\nexamples below will illustrate this theory (Evans and Green\n2006, 230\u201347, 286\u2013310; Ungerer and Schmid 2006, 114\u201327;\nEvans 2007, 33\u201335, 61\u201362; Grady 2007).\nThe first example demonstrates the pervasiveness of certain\nconceptual metaphors across languages and cultures owing to\nmotivation by common human physical experience, as shown in\nexample (3).\n(3) (a) \u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05e7\u05b8 \u05d9\u05db\u05b4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\u05d9\u05b0\u05be\u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d1\u05b8 \u05be\u05d9\u05db\u05b4 \u05e5\u05e8\u05c1\u05b6\u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8 \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05b5\u05e9\u05b0 \u05bc\u05b9\u05d9 \u05dc\u05bc\u05b9\u05db \u05d5\u05bc\u05d6\u05d2\u05b0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\n\u2018Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day\nof the LORD is coming; it is near\u2019 (Joel 2.1) 138 Ross\n(b) \u05e8 \u05bc\u05b9\u05d1\u05e2\u05b2 \u05d9\u05b7 \u05d9\u05db\u05b4 \u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05de\u05ea\u05b0 \u05d0\u05c1\u05b6 \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05db\u05b0 \u05da\u05b8\u05d9\u05e0\u05c1\u05b6\u05d9\u05e2\u05bc\u05b5\u05d1\u05b0 \u05dd\u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05e9\u05b8 \u05e3\u05dc\u05c1\u05b6\u05d0\u05c1\u05b6 \u05d9\u05db\u05b4\n\u2018For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday\nwhen it is past\u2019 (Ps. 90.4)\nOne of the most pervasive conceptual metaphors is to understand\nTIME in terms of either SPACE or MOTION. In (3a) we see the FUTURE\nEVENTS ARE AHEAD metaphor, which arises from our experience of\nlooking in the direction in which we are physically moving, so\nthat as entities get closer to us they become visually larger.\nPhysical movement through space also involves temporal pro-\ngression, such that arrival at a distant destination corresponds to\na future point in time. Along these same lines, a converse meta-\nphorical entailment appears in (3b), where PAST EVENTS ARE\nBEHIND.\nThe second set of examples is more specific to the con-\nceptual environment of ancient Israelite prophetic literature, in\nwhich the relationship between God and his people is portrayed\nas a marriage. This idea appears vividly in Ezekiel 16, where in\nverse 8 God says: \u201cI also swore to you and entered into a covenant\nwith you so that you became mine.\u201d In that chapter and others\nthroughout the prophetical books there are statements like the\nfollowing:\n(4) (a) \u05da\u05b0 \u05de\u05bc\u05b5 \u05e9\u05b0 \u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05b7 \u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05ea\u05b4 \u05d5\u05b7 \u05da\u05b0\u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05e4\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05b4 \u05d8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b0\u05ea\u05b4 \u05d5\u05b7\n\u2018But you trusted in your beauty and became a whore\nbecause of your fame\u2019 (Ezek. 16.15)\n(b) \u05d4\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05b9\u05d6 \u05d4\u05e2\u05b8 \u05bc\u05b9\u05e6 \u05ea\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b7 \u05df\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b2\u05e8\u05b7 \u05e5\u05e2\u05bc\u05b5 \u05be\u05dc\u05db\u05b8 \u05ea\u05d7\u05b7 \u05ea\u05b7 \u05d5\u05b0 \u05d4\u05d4\u05b8\u05bc\u05b9\u05d1\u05d2\u05b0 \u05d4\u05e2\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05d2\u05b4\u05be\u05dc\u05db\u05b8 \u05be\u05dc\u05e2\u05b7 \u05d9\u05db\u05b4\n\u2018For on every high hill and under every green tree you\nhave lain down as a whore\u2019 (Jer. 2.20b)\nAt the foundation of verses like these is the conceptual meta-\nphor COVENANT IS MARRIAGE. However, a number of derivative Cognitive Linguistics 139\nmetaphors also emerge as a result of the structure of MARRIAGE\u2014\nat least as it was understood in the ancient Israel\u2014as a concep-\ntual domain. For example, in (4a) God\u2019s people are condemned\nin the broader contexts of the sentences in (4) on the basis of the\nmetaphor IDOLATRY IS ADULTERY. The same metaphor appears in\n(4b), but with the additional implication that HIGH PLACES ARE\nSITES OF SEXUAL LIAISON. Of course, both examples in (4) are linked\nto the broader conceptual metaphor WORSHIP IS SEX.26\n2.2.4. Mental Spaces and Conceptual Blending\nConceptual blending is a theory initially posited by Fauconnier\n(1994) and further developed by Fauconnier and Turner (2002),\nwho argue that meaning is constructed in larger units of language\n(i.e., the sentence level and above) by integrating knowledge\nstructures in novel and creative ways that give rise to a \u2018blend\u2019.\nConceptual blending is a basic, effortless cognitive process in\nhuman thought and imagination that is prompted directly in the\ndynamic context of communication. Again, Cognitive Linguistic\ntheory hypothesises that language grants access to encyclopaedic\nknowledge of the external world as a kind of prompt for con-\nceptualisation. This approach entails that meaning construction\nis grounded in language use, such that there is no principled divi-\nsion between semantics and pragmatics, as in formal approaches\n(Turner 1991, 206; Birdsell 2014).27\n26 Further illustration of conceptual metaphor theory for Hebrew\nappears in Ziegert (2021, 31\u201333).\n27 That is, they are not absolutely distinct. Cognitive Linguistic theory\nplaces semantics and pragmatics on a continuum of form-meaning\npairings that may move from the pragmatic pole to the semantic pole 140 Ross\nMeaning construction through conceptual blending involves\nthe integration of mental spaces. Fauconnier (2007, 351) defines\nmental spaces as \u201cvery partial assemblies constructed as we think\nand talk for purposes of local understanding and action. They\ncontain elements and are structured by frames and cognitive\nmodels\u2026 [and] are connected to each other by various kinds of\nmappings, in particular identity and analogy mappings.\u201d As\nEvans and Green (2006, 369) put it, \u201cyou can think of a mental\nspace as a \u2018thought bubble\u2019.\u201d Mental space theory is distinct from\nconceptual blending theory, but the two are closely related and\nfunction in a similar way to conceptual metaphor, though with\nimportant differences. Whereas conceptual metaphor involves\nunidirectional mapping of domains, conceptual blending involves\nselective integration of mental spaces into a novel elaboration.\nWhereas conceptual metaphors are stable and widely shared\nknowledge structures held in long-term memory, conceptual\nblends may be temporary and unique conceptualisations of\ninformation for creative purposes specific to ongoing discourse\n(although even blends may become conventionalised in long-\nterm habitual cognitive structures).\nConsider the example of conceptual blending in (5) below.\nThis text is part of the same passage as example (2) above, and\ndescribes the resolution to the disciples\u2019 misconstrual of Jesus\u2019\nwarning.\nas they become conventionalised in the language over time through\nentrenchment.

The input\nspaces share features that are explicated in the generic space at\nthe top of the figure. Through conceptually projecting and\nintegrating input features, a novel conceptualisation emerges,\nrepresented at the bottom in the \u2018blended space\u2019. Note that this\nmapping is selective; not all properties and elements in the input\nspaces are necessarily involved in the blend (Fauconnier 1994; Cognitive Linguistics 143\n1997; Fauconnier and Turner 1998; Evans and Green 2006, 363\u2013\n444; Evans 2007, 12\u201313, 114\u201315; Fauconnier 2007).\nAs noted above in \u00a72.2.2, at first the disciples misunder-\nstand because they are conceptualising Jesus\u2019 comments within\nthe BAKING semantic frame alone. But after Jesus reminds them\nthat obtaining actual bread for food is not the real problem (Matt.\n16.9\u201310), they reconceptualise his words in terms of the blend\nportrayed in Figure 2. Jesus\u2019 clarification in (5a) prompts\ndynamic and temporary meaning construction in the context of\ntheir communication. As the features of each input space are\nintegrated in the conceptual blend, novel meaning construction\noccurs. That meaning is represented in a limited way in the\nblended space, where the implications can be conceptually elabo-\nrated. For example, in the blend, the PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES\n(or perhaps just TEACHERS) ARE BAKERS, the SYNAGOGUE IS A\nKITCHEN, and anyone there as A LISTENER IS DOUGH. As Jesus\nexplains, TEACHING IS LEAVEN, which has a disproportionate and\ndeterminative effect upon the outcome of DOUGH, for better or\nworse, when it is baked. In this sense, then, a DISCIPLE IS A LOAF\nOF BREAD. In a context where bread was a major part of daily diet\nand local bakers and bread quality would have been well known,\nthis conceptual blend would have had readily accessible explana-\ntory power.\n2.2.5. Prototypes and Semantic Extension\nThe cognitive approach to lexical semantics understands words\nas lexical items whose meanings are associated with a complex\nbut structured conceptual category (or categories). This view of 144 Ross\ncategorisation was originally posited by Rosch (1978) and\ndeveloped by Lakoff (1987), Taylor (2003), and others. Cognitive\nLinguistic theory hypothesises that conceptual categories form\nbecause humans gather as much information about our environ-\nment as possible with the least possible cognitive effort. The cate-\ngorisation process also occurs because humans perceive con-\nsistent correlation between features of the external world. The\nprinciple of economy gives rise to differing levels of inclusiveness\nfor categories and their members, while the principle of correla-\ntion informs the organisation of category members around a\ncentral exemplar, which is called a prototype. As such, the\ncategories are radial, organised around the prototype to include\nother, gradually more peripheral members that are distinct but\nrelated. Prototype theory applies to lexical semantics insofar as\nany given word also forms a category\u2014held in the \u2018mental\nlexicon\u2019\u2014with a prototypical meaning (or sense) at its centre and\nwith other meanings extending from the prototype in a semantic\nnetwork.28 This model of lexical semantics integrates other\naspects of Cognitive Linguistic theory, especially image schemas,\nsemantic frames, and conceptual metaphor theory. It is primarily\n28 Note that prototype theory is applicable to both onomasiology and\nsemasiology. The former deals with how words are used to categorise\n(or name) objects in the external world, whereas the latter deals with\nthe network of concepts (or meanings) of a word understood as a\ncategory itself. Cognitive lexical semantics deals with both, but the\ndiscussion below is semasiological. The term mental lexicon refers to\nthe inventory of words known by a language speaker, which is\norganised and detailed but nevertheless latent knowledge. See further\nAitchison (2012); Taylor (2012). Cognitive Linguistics 145\nby these cognitive mechanisms that Cognitive Linguistics has\naccounted for word meaning as a semantic network in which less\nprototypical senses derive from more prototypical senses through\nmotivated (though not always predictable) meaning extension\n(Taylor 2003, 41\u201383; Evans and Green 2006, 328\u201363, 445\u201367;\nGeeraerts 2006c; Evans 2007, 175, 176\u201377; Lewandowska-\nTomaszczyk 2007; Geeraerts 2010, 182\u2013272; 2015).\nTo illustrate prototype theory, cognitive semantics, and\nembodied cognition, we will revisit \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7\u05de from example (1b),\nabove. This lexical item is a compound of the preposition \u05df \u05de\n(\u2018from\u2019) and \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7, the latter of which will come into focus here\nfirst. The prototypical sense of this nominal appears to be front\nas an embodied, spatial concept.

Even so, the front meaning associated with both \u05d4\u05e0\u05e4 and \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7\narose from the embodied construal of the human face as the axial\nfront of a person given the orientation of visual perception.29\n29 The same construal underlies the verb \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7 \u2018 to meet, confront\u2019, which\nlikely derived from the nominal. 146 Ross\nTwo other senses of \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7 extend from the spa tial prototype,\neach of which is motivated by different metaphorical construals\nof SPACE and TIME as semantic domains. Owing to embodied expe-\nrience and encyclopaedic knowledge, the period of time catego-\nrised as a DAY is associated with the light of the SUN, which\u2014as\ndepicted with the arrow labelled A in Figure 3\u2014follows a con-\nsistent directional trajectory from the temporal BEGINNING of the\nperiod in the east to its END in the west.30\nFigure 3: Semantic extension of \u05dd \u05d3\u05e7\nA\nB\nEND/BACK/WEST BEGINNING/FRONT/EAST\n30 Although space constraints prohibit fuller substantiation of this lexi-\ncal semantic proposal, it is noteworthy that the polysemy of the Hebrew\nword \u05df \u05d9\u05de\u05d9 supports it, as the word can mean both right (side) or south.\nThe former is the spatial prototype; the latter is a metonymic extension\nthat can only be motivated within an eastward-facing construal, as I am\nproposing for \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7. It seems that eastwardness was construed as the\nunmarked/default directionality (e.g., Zebulun\u2019s boundary runs \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05e7\n\u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d6\u05de, \u2018forwards, towards sunrise\u2019 to Gath-hepher in Josh. 19.13). In\naddition, eastward orientation was significant in other aspects of\nIsraelite culture, as in the geographical orientation of the entrance to\nthe Tabernacle and later Solomon\u2019s Temple (like many other ancient\nNear Eastern religious structures) towards the east (see Exod. 26.18\u201322;\n1 Kgs 7; cf. Gen. 3.24 below). Cognitive Linguistics 147\nThose earliest and latest temporal periods of the DAY period may\nbe metaphorically construed as its spatial FRONT and BACK through\nthe cognitively routine conceptual metaphor TIME IS SPACE, or,\nmore specifically in this instance, THE BEGINNING IS THE FRONT.

It is in this way that the proto-\ntypical spatial meaning of \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7 \u2018f ront\u2019 can extend metaphorically\nto the temporal sense \u2018before\u2019.\nA second semantic extension occurs, however, when the\nconcept of directionality is added (with the affixed preposition\n\u05df\u05de) to the spatial construal of a DAY, as depicted with the arrow\nlabelled B in Figure 3.

In this way, the third sense\n\u2018east\u2019 is motivated by the conceptual metaphor EASTWARDNESS IS\nPROXIMITY TO SUNRISE. 31\n2.2.6. Cognitive Approaches to Grammar\nThe study of grammar was at the centre of the emergence of\nCognitive Linguistics out of generativism in the 1970s and 1980s.\nSince that time, two broad approaches to grammar have appeared\nas trunks of a single Cognitive Linguistic tree; distinct but\ngrounded in the same spot. On the one hand there is Cognitive\nGrammar, a broad theoretical framework developed by Langacker\n(1987; 1991) that is to date the most influential (see the over-\nviews in Langacker 2007 and Bennett 2014). It is also very\ndetailed and expansive, to the extent that the introduction by\nTaylor (2002) covers topics ranging from phonology and mor-\nphology to verbal tense and idioms. On the other hand, there is\n31 The use of \u05df\u05de (\u2018from\u2019) with \u05dd\u05d3\u05e7 in this sense indicates a different\nconstrual of focal and non-focal entities as compared with English\ndirectional expressions. When correlating entities with cardinal direc-\ntions, native English speakers construe eastward positionality as com-\npleted movement from the focal entity(1) to the non-focal entity(2) (e.g.,\nJonah(2) was [positioned to the] east of the city(1)). Hebrew speakers,\nhowever, appear to have had EAST as a directionally-stable third concept\nin the construal, such that eastward positionality of the non-focal\nentity(2) was construed as completed movement from the EAST(3) towards\nthe focal entity(1) (e.g., Jonah(2) was [positioned from the] east(3) of the\ncity(1)). Cognitive Linguistics 149\nConstruction Grammar, the roots of which appear in Kay and\nFillmore (1999) and Goldberg (1995), and which was later devel-\noped by Croft (2001) and others.32\nIt is important to note that the six key concepts of Cognitive\nLinguistics discussed so far have been focused on semantics, spe-\ncifically how meaning emerges in linguistic structures from con-\nceptual structures. Cognitive approaches to grammar use these\nsame key concepts to focus more directly on the linguistic system\nitself. In doing so, there are certainly differences between Cog-\nnitive and Construction Grammars, but they nevertheless share\ntwo guiding principles and are therefore compatible (see further\nBroccias 2006). The first is the symbolic thesis, which holds that\nthe basic unit of grammar is a form-meaning pairing as a linguis-\ntic unit. In contrast to formalist approaches, this thesis entails\nthat grammatical structure is not treated separately from mean-\ning. Cognitive approaches to grammar take all form-meaning\npairings into consideration as a unified and structured inventory\nof conventional linguistic units, from the level of bound mor-\nphemes, to lexical items, to syntactic configurations, understand-\ning these units as existing along a continuum. The second guiding\nprinciple is the usage-based thesis, discussed above in \u00a72.1.4.\nWithin the realm of grammar, this thesis entails that each lan-\nguage user develops a kind of mental grammar through experi-\nence, with no sharp division between knowledge of a language\n32 See the overviews in Croft (2007) and Ramonda (2014). See also\nHoffmann and Trousdale (2013) and the recent work by Hoffmann\n(2022). The earliest Construction Grammar proposal was Fillmore, Kay,\nand O\u2019Connor (1988). 150 Ross\nand use of a language (Croft and Cruse 2004, 225\u201390; Evans and\nGreen 2006, 475\u2013511; Ungerer and Schmid 2006, 244\u201356).\nThis section will focus only briefly on two examples to\nillustrate Construction Grammar in particular, building on \u00a72.2.2\nabove. Construction Grammar helps to account for both \u2018irregu-\nlar\u2019 idiomatic expressions as well as \u2018regular\u2019 syntactic expres-\nsions as linguistic units called constructions. While the former are\nnot discussed here for reasons of space, the example in (9) below\nhelps illustrate the latter in terms of the argument structure of\nconstructions at the sentence level.\n(9) \u03a3\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f41 \u03ba\u1f7b\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1f7b\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1f77\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f73\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f71\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7.\n\u2018Then out of pity that servant\u2019s master released him and\nforgave him the debt.\u2019 (Matt. 18.27)\nThis use of \u1f00\u03c6\u1f77\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 as a ditransitive verb meaning forgive is com-\nmon in the New Testament (cf. Matt. 6.12; 12.31), involving a\nsyntactic construction that we will call Forgive Y Z and that can\nbe represented as X RESOLVES Y FOR Z (or, even more simply,\nCAUSE-RECEIVE with the Y resolution in view). In this construction,\nX is the AGENT, Y the PATIENT, and Z the BENEFICIARY (SVOdirOind),\nwith each argument expressed in the nominative, accusative, and\ndative cases, respectively.33\nGoldberg\u2019s Construction Grammar approach to verb argu-\nment structure can also help account for sense distinctions by\nvirtue of semantic frames. For example, the Forgive Y Z Construc-\ntion in (9) involves the FINANCIAL TRANSACTION frame in which\n33 For further discussion of this construction and how it can be repre-\nsented at semantic and syntactic levels, see Goldberg (2006, 20\u201322). Cognitive Linguistics 151\nthe conceptual metaphor SIN IS DEBT TO GOD appears. But the verb\n\u1f00\u03c6\u1f77\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 also has a permit sense, which still has three arguments but\ninvolves a different construction and semantic frame, as shown\nin (10).\n(10) \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f24\u03c6\u03b9\u03b5\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u1f79\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f94\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f79\u03bd.\n\u2018And he would not permit the demons to speak, since they\nknew him.\u2019 (Mark 1.34b; cf. Matt. 8.22; Luke 8.51; Rev.\n11.9)\nThe construction here might be called Allow Y to Z and can be\nrepresented as X ALLOWS Y TO PERFORM Z ACTION. This is a varia-\ntion of the CAUSE-RECEIVE construction, where X is still the AGENT\nand Y the PATIENT, but Z is now another verb in the infinitive\n(SVOI), which will involve its own construction. The semantic\nframe varies depending upon what fills the Y and Z roles, but in\nmany cases it is an AUTHORITY or CONTROL frame.\n3.0. Cognitive Linguistics in Biblical Studies\nBecause Cognitive Linguistic theory itself is not a single set of\nclearly defined procedures and approaches, as noted above, it is\nno surprise that the use of Cognitive Linguistics within biblical\nscholarship is similarly variegated (Howe and Sweetser 2013,\n122). The earliest application of Cognitive Linguistics to the\nstudy of the Bible and its languages was the use of conceptual\nmetaphor theory by Brettler (1989), a substantial revision of his\ndoctoral dissertation. \u2018Use\u2019 may be too strong a word, however,\nas the interaction is limited to five total citations of the work of\nLakoff and Johnson (1980), all of which appear in the introduc-\ntory chapter on method. The word \u2018cognitive\u2019 does not appear 152 Ross\nanywhere in Brettler\u2019s work and even \u2018conceptual metaphor\u2019\noccurs only once (23).\nStill, Brettler\u2019s study brought Cognitive Linguistics in its\nearly phase to the attention of biblical scholarship, particularly\nin the study of Hebrew. Green and Howe (2014, 1) call this a\n\u201cfirst wave,\u201d which was followed in the 1990s and early 2000s\nby a number of journal articles and conference papers that mostly\napplied Cognitive Linguistic theory to the Hebrew Bible. The\n\u201csecond wave\u201d of influence they identify as the formation of \u2018The\nUse of Cognitive Linguistics in Biblical Interpretation\u2019 consulta-\ntion at the 2006 annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Lit-\nerature, under the leadership of Mary Therese DesCamp, Joel B.\nGreen, Bonnie Howe, and Eve Sweetser. Howe and Sweetser\n(2013, 124\u201325) give a useful overview of the first six years of\nactivity in this group, which ultimately culminated in the pub-\nlication of a volume of collected essays that nicely balances\nHebrew and Greek studies (Howe and Green 2014).34\nBiblical scholars have of course continued to employ Cogni-\ntive Linguistic theory in their work to great effect, both indepen-\ndently and in connection with the SBL annual meeting. The fol-\nlowing discussion highlights contributions in each of the respec-\ntive biblical languages. Because Howe and Sweetser (2013, 125\u2013\n34 It is my honour to serve presently as a member of the steering commit-\ntee of the current iteration of this same group, now known as the Cogni-\ntive Linguistics in Biblical Interpretation programme unit. At present,\nmembers of the committee are working towards an edited volume intro-\nducing Cognitive Linguistics for biblical scholars that is to be published\nwith SBL Press. Cognitive Linguistics 153\n27) provide a useful survey of Cognitive Linguistics in bibli-\ncal studies up through 2012, this section focuses on work that\nhas appeared in the ten years since then, but is by no means\nexhaustive.35\nAs may be evident already in this section, it is true that\nmost of the application of Cognitive Linguistics in biblical schol-\narship has so far gone to Hebrew. By far the best introduction to\nand overview of this Hebrew scholarship to date is van der\nMerwe (2021). In a bibliography of just over one hundred publi-\ncations dealing with Cognitive Linguistics in biblical studies in\nthe last ten years (which is nevertheless surely not exhaustive),\nalmost sixty percent of the bibliography relates to Hebrew, with\njust under twenty percent to Greek. Overall, the great majority\nof publications are essay-length, appearing in either journals or\nedited volumes. Despite their narrower scope, these contributions\ndo not merely address finer linguistic matters. For example, Ross\n(2019) considers how attention to the conceptual blends con-\nstructed in Ps. 51 offers a different and perhaps better under-\nstanding of the final verses than has otherwise been considered.\nMany interpreters regard vv. 18\u201319 (Hebrew vv. 20\u201321) as a later\ninterpolation, assuming that the plea that the LORD would \u201cbuild\nup the walls of Jerusalem\u201d is an abrupt change of topic that must\nhave arisen in a postexilic context. But these verses in fact\ninteract and cohere with the entire psalm to prompt a conceptual\nblend in which David himself is Zion/Jerusalem whose damaged\nspiritual walls require restoration by God the builder. This\n35 Key works from these earlier years would include, for example,\nDanove (2001) and van Wolde (2009), among others. 154 Ross\napplication of Cognitive Linguistics thus goes beyond language\nitself to help address interpretive debates and even compositional\nhistory.\nIn the scope of publications, far fewer in number are mono-\ngraphs that apply Cognitive Linguistics to the biblical languages.\nWhen these do appear, such studies tend to be the published form\nof doctoral dissertations (a notable exception here is van Wolde\n2009). As such, these works can be extremely helpful on a\nbroader topic, but of course still remain limited by default in\nwhat they address. A good example here is Robar (2015), who\nemploys Cognitive Linguistics to address the function of the\nHebrew wayyiq\u1e6dol form at a discourse level to indicate schematic\ncontinuity (see also Robar 2021). Biblical scholarship has also\nbegun to see Cognitive Linguistics applied in part or whole in\ncollaborative edited volumes. For example, Ross and Runge\n(2022) present a collection of essays focused on understanding\nthe semantics of postclassical Greek prepositions in Cognitive\nLinguistic perspective, particularly using prototype theory, point-\ning to new possibilities in lexicography and drawing out interpre-\ntative implications. Similarly, the volume edited by Garc\u00eda Ure\u00f1a\net al. (2022) applies cognitive semantic theory to the lexicogra-\nphy of colour terms related to green within the Hebrew, Greek,\nand Latin Scriptures, analysing meaning at both the lexical and\nsymbolic or cultural levels.\nRarest of all at this point are large-scale works that employ\nCognitive Linguistics in the more standard or traditional categories\nof biblical studies publications. While there are some grammars,\nfor example, that do reflect a much more up-to-date linguistic Cognitive Linguistics 155\nframework, such as van der Merwe, Naud\u00e9, and Kroeze (2017),\nto date none attempt to apply Cognitive Linguistics systemati-\ncally. It is also fair to say that syntax has received virtually no\nattention within biblical scholarship from a Cognitive Linguistic\nperspective, despite the remarkable explanatory power of Con-\nstruction Grammar for phenomena that so far have been exam-\nined only within a generative framework. Lexical semantics has\nfared better than syntax in biblical studies, but still lexicography\nproper has seen comparatively few results in print. However,\nfollowing calls by van der Merwe (2006, 88\u201389) for attention to\nencyclopedic information in lexical entries, Reinier de Blois has\nbeen at work editing the Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew.\nAlthough the project is ongoing, its approach is based firmly in\nCognitive Linguistic theory and the initial results are highly\npromising.36\n4.0. Prospects for Research and Application\nThis essay has only begun to outline the theory and potential of\nCognitive Linguistics, which is now widely recognised as one of\nthe major linguistic frameworks, one that continues to grow in\npopularity and application in numerous venues around the\nworld. One of those venues has certainly been biblical studies.\nYet despite the fact that Cognitive Linguistics has been present\nwithin biblical scholarship for thirty years, its effects and influ-\nence are far from pervasive, for several reasons. One simple rea-\nson is that, while much of the activity in biblical studies involves\n36 The dictionary is freely available online at https://\nsemanticdictionary.org/, accessed 4 May 2023. 156 Ross\nthe biblical languages, only a small proportion of scholarship\nfocuses directly on refining contemporary understanding of the\nbiblical languages themselves.37 Another reason, alluded to at the\noutset, is that even scholars who engage regularly with the lan-\nguages tend not to be acquainted with linguistic theory per se.38\nKnowledge of the differences between structuralism and genera-\ntivism, for example, is nowhere within the expertise of many,\nperhaps most, biblical scholars. Given the scope and complexity\nof linguistics itself, that is rather unsurprising. But the practical\neffect is to leave biblical scholars in the dark as to what sort of\ntheoretical framework underpins their favourite biblical lan-\nguage tool and what that might entail, if they even understand\nthat there are indeed entailments. It is precisely this situation in\nthe discipline that this volume seeks to remedy, at least in part\n(to mix several metaphors) by offering some teaser trailers, land-\nmarks for orientation, and goods to test out.\nIn the end, however, biblical scholars must learn a hard\nlesson: If we truly wish to understand Cognitive Linguistics as a\ntheoretical framework and apply it to better understand the\nancient languages, it is directly to the primary literature itself\n37 One might add that there is a sizeable portion of biblical scholarship\nthat gives little to no attention to the biblical languages at all. Profi-\nciency in the biblical languages seems ever more to be a specialisation\nunto itself.\n38 There are exceptions that prove this general rule, notably the volume\nby Hornkohl and Khan (2021), which brings together specialists in\nBiblical and Rabbinic Hebrew and theoretical linguists. Cognitive Linguistics 157\nthat we must go. Although some may worry they have no busi-\nness or no hope in so doing, it is worth noting that the abundant\nproliferation of introductions, handbooks, and companions over\nthe last decade or so has not been limited to areas of biblical\nscholarship. Happily, the same phenomena characterise other\ndisciplines as well, including linguistics. On a very simple level,\nthen, one of the most promising prospects for Cognitive Lin-\nguistics in biblical studies is for biblical scholars to take up and\nread such resources as are listed in the section below. Under-\nstanding and applying Cognitive Linguistic theory is much more\neasily within reach than might be expected. For those already\nacquainted with Cognitive Linguistics\u2014or at least those on their\nway\u2014the prospects for research in the biblical languages and\napplication in interpretation of Scripture are virtually limitless.\n5.0.

HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS AND THE\nBIBLICAL LANGUAGES\nKaspars Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nThe student of Biblical Hebrew can observe with relative ease\nthat the language of the Old Testament not only differs from\ngenre to genre and author to author, but also that it exhibits\nvariation across its diachronically diverse writings.1 Likewise, the\nclassicist engaging with the Greek of the New Testament will note\nthat it differs in important ways from the Greek of earlier time\nperiods. Language change is a fact of life, and the biblical text is\ncertainly no exception to this. Yet the rigorous application of the\nfindings and methodology of historical linguistics to biblical\nstudies has been less prevalent and less thorough than might be\nexpected. This chapter provides a broad introduction to historical\nlinguistics\u2014the study of language change\u2014especially as applied\nto biblical studies.\n1 This point, like almost anything in biblical scholarship, is disputed.\nYet even those who would argue that the Old Testament is entirely the\nproduct of a single era still claim that certain authors employed an\narchaising style that reflects a diachronically earlier state of the lan-\nguage.

The History of Historical Linguistics\nAlthough it has important historical precursors, modern linguis-\ntics developed in the wake of the Scientific Revolution of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe. Historical linguis-\ntics in particular plays a special role in the historical development\nof linguistic inquiry, since the first systematic investigations into\nthe nature of language were undertaken by scholars specifically\ninterested in language change and the relationships among\nlanguages.2\nInitial linguistic investigation, especially in the nineteenth\ncentury, was focused on the classification and comparison of the\nolder languages of Europe and southwest Asia (the language\nfamily that came to be known as Indo-European). The growing\nimpetus for these investigations occurred towards the end of the\neighteenth century, as Europeans gradually became familiar with\nthe languages and cultures of ancient India. In this connection, a\nfamous statement from a speech delivered by Sir William Jones\nto the Asiatic Society in 1786 has been frequently quoted\n(Fortson 2010, 9):\nThe Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a\nwonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more\ncopious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than\n2 There are also other important terms that are used to describe the\nfield. One is comparative linguistics, which emphasises the comparative\nmethod as a means for reconstructing linguistic history (see \u00a72.2.3).\nAnother is diachronic linguistics, a term that is perhaps less ambiguous\nthan historical linguistics, since the latter could possibly be interpreted\nas the study of the history of the field of linguistics in toto. 174 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\neither, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both\nin the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could\npossibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed,\nthat no philologer could examine them all three, without\nbelieving them to have sprung from some common source,\nwhich, perhaps, no longer exists; there is a similar reason,\nthough not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the\nGothick and the Celtick, though blended with a very differ-\nent idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the\nold Persian might be added to the same family.\nJones\u2019 somewhat hyperbolic and subjective descriptions of these\nlanguages might strike the modern reader as being rather quaint.\nNevertheless, a fundamental axiom of historical linguistics posits\nthat descendent languages are related to one another via a now-\nlost parent language. Even geographically and chronologically\ndiverse languages can be unexpectedly related. Table 1 compares\ncognates in English, ancient Greek, Latvian (a Baltic language\nspoken in Northern Europe), classical Latin, and Hittite (an\nextinct language originally spoken in present-day Turkey).\nTable 1: Cognates in select Indo-European languages\nEnglish Greek Latvian Latin Hittite\nwater \u1f51\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1 \u016bdens Umbr. utur w\u0101t-ar, -en-\nbrother \u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1 br\u0101lis fr\u0101ter negna\u0161\nthree \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 tr\u012bs tr\u0113s tere\u0161\ncow \u03b2\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 govs b\u014ds GUD\n(I) am \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af esmu sum \u0113\u0161mi\nnight \u03bd\u03cd\u03be nakts nox nekuz\nThese languages exhibit similar basic vocabulary even though\nthey range from the second millennium BC to the present day\nand from Turkey (Hittite) to Northern Europe (Latvian). The\nclose resemblances demonstrate a genetic link between these Historical Linguistics 175\ngeographically diverse languages (two modern, three ancient)\nand rule out accidental resemblance or borrowing. Following\nJones, nineteenth-century scholars were preoccupied with the\nrelationships of these similar languages and they endeavoured to\nreconstruct their parent language, which came to be called Proto-\nIndo-European.\nHowever, after the appearance of Ferdinand de Saussure\u2019s\nclassic Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale in 1916, the diachronic\ndimension of language study became more of a minor player in\nlinguistics and was replaced by a primary focus in the twentieth\ncentury on the synchronic study of language.3 Such a neat bifur-\ncation is of course an oversimplification, for diachrony and syn-\nchrony are always in relation with one another in language. In\nfact, a renewed appreciation for the centrality of diachrony in\nlinguistics has grown in recent decades (see, for example, Bybee\n2010; Hartmann 2021).\nAn overview of the history of the discipline will ideally\nfocus on the study of the biblical languages, which are naturally\nof primary interest to biblical scholars. The languages of the Old\nand New Testaments (Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek) belong to\ntwo linguistic families: Semitic and Indo-European. As such, it is\nappropriate to approach the field of historical linguistics from the\nperspective of these two language families. As it happens, most\nwork in historical linguistics has thus far been done within these\nsame two language families.\n3 Ironically, some of Saussure\u2019s greatest early work was in the area of\nhistorical linguistics (see \u00a71.1. below). 176 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\n1.1. Indo-European Studies\nKoine Greek, the language of the New Testament era, belongs to\nthe Greek (or Hellenic) branch of the Indo-European family of\nlanguages. The designation Koine (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae meaning \u2018common\u2019)\nrefers to the lingua franca status of the Attic-Ionic dialect that\nspread throughout the Greek empire, launched by the conquests\nof Alexander the Great. Two earlier major periods in the written\nhistory of Greek may be identified: Classical/Archaic Greek and\nMycenaean Greek (late second millennium BCE). The latter is of\ninterest to Indo-Europeanists and other scholars because of its\nearly attestation and its peculiar writing system, deciphered in\nthe 1950s by Michael Ventris (see Ventris and Chadwick 1973).\nThe Indo-European family of languages contains several\nhundred languages (depending on classification) and is the\nlargest such linguistic grouping in the world, by number of\nspeakers. The designation Indo-European is intended to (roughly)\nencompass most of the languages spoken in the lands of Europe\nand Southwest Asia.4 The major subfamilies are (in order of\nearliest written attestation): Anatolian, Indic, Iranian, Greek (or\n4 The German term indogermanisch is somewhat more precise, since the\nwesternmost territory (namely, Scandinavia and Iceland) is inhabited\nby speakers of Germanic languages. (The equivalent term Indo-Germanic\nis now outdated in English.) The extinct Tocharian languages are a\ngeographical outlier, having been spoken in the modern Chinese\nprovince of Xinjiang (in central Asia). A few languages in Europe are\nnon-Indo-European, notably the Finno-Ugric languages Estonian,\nFinnish, and Hungarian. Basque (Spain and France) is a famous lan-\nguage isolate, while Maltese is a Semitic language. Historical Linguistics 177\nHellenic), Italic, Celtic, Germanic, Armenian, Tocharian, Slavic,\nBaltic, Albanian. 5 Several Indo-European languages enjoy a\nlengthy period of written attestation (rivalled only by some\nSemitic languages). The earliest attested written records are from\nthe extinct Anatolian family (spoken in present-day Turkey), in\nparticular, Hittite, dating back roughly to the Late Bronze Age.6\nEarly scholarly efforts at reconstructing Proto-Indo-\nEuropean were influenced by the prestige of Sanskrit, the classi-\ncal language of India (equivalent in status to that of Latin in\nEurope). This led scholars to reconstruct Proto-Indo-European\nwith broadly similar features, especially in its vowel system. Sub-\nsequent study revealed that Greek, with its inherited five-vowel\ndistinction, was in fact more archaic than the three-vowel distinc-\ntion of Sanskrit.7\n5 Several larger subgroupings are typically made by scholars. The most\nclear is Indo-Iranian (Indic together with Iranian). Most scholars would\nalso group together Baltic and Slavic (Balto-Slavic). Much more contro-\nversial is Italo-Celtic. Additionally, certain shared isoglosses lead many\nscholars to group together Balto-Slavic and Germanic in a northern\ndialect group, as well as Greek, Indo-Iranian, Armenian, and the poorly\nattested Phrygian into a southern dialect group.\n6 The earliest attested record of any Indo-European material is found in\nthe form of Hittite loanwords in Old Assyrian texts from Kani\u0161, dating\nto the Middle Bronze Age (18th century BCE). See Kloekhorst (2019).\n7 Indo-Iranian (the sub-branch in which Sanskrit is located) distin-\nguishes three vowel qualities (\u012b,\u0306 \u0101,\u0306 \u016b)\u0306 , with *\u0113 \u0306 and *\u014d \u0306 having merged to\n\u0101.\u0306 Note that the asterisk symbol is universally used in historical linguis-\ntics to denote a linguistic reconstruction that is prehistoric (i.e., prior to\nwritten records). 178 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nA major milestone in Indo-European studies was the recon-\nstruction of a class of consonants called laryngeals, first hypo-\nthesised by Ferdinand de Saussure (1879). His rather brilliant\nreasoning is akin to the method now known as internal recon-\nstruction.8 The empirical existence of these consonants was con-\nfirmed by the discovery of Hittite (of the Anatolian branch) in\nthe early twentieth century. The laryngeals were partly preserved\nintact in Anatolian, while in other branches they were lost,\nalthough they left various important traces (such as adjacent\nvowel colouring, compensatory lengthening, and other effects).\nMost scholars today reconstruct three laryngeals, conventionally\ndesignated *h , *h , *h . Their actual phonetic values are still\n1 2 3\nunknown, though many scholars hypothesise that they were\nfricatives of some type, perhaps glottal and pharyngeal.9\n8 In retrospect, one can see a kinship between Saussure\u2019s later\ninfluential ideas on structuralism and the reasoning he employed here.\n9 An illustration of the crucial role that laryngeals play in Indo-\nEuropean linguistics is seen, for example, in the interplay of\nmorphological vowel alternations (called ablaut) and root structure in\nthe singular and plural perfect stems of verbs like \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9 \u2018leave\u2019 (e.g., \u03bb\u03ad-\n\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0-\u03b1 and \u03bb\u03b5-\u03bb\u03af\u03c0-\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd). Notice that the singular features an o-grade\nvowel in the root, whereas the plural lacks this. In another pair of forms,\nsuch as \u03b4\u03ad-\u03b4\u03c9-\u03ba\u03b1 (1 sg.) and \u03b4\u03ad-\u03b4\u03bf-\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (1 pl.), the difference observed is\na vowel length distinction. However, with the postulation of a laryngeal\nfor this second verbal root, the morphological symmetry is restored:\n*de-doh - (sg.) ~ *de-dh - (pl.). The loss of the laryngeal was not without\n3 3\neffects: compensatory lengthening in the singular stem (*de-doh - >\n3\n\u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03c9-) and vowel epenthesis in the plural stem (*de-dh - > \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf-).\n3\nCompare the reconstructed stems for \u03bb\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1 ~ \u03bb\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd: *le-loikw- (sg.)\n~ *le-likw- (pl.). Historical Linguistics 179\nA landmark multi-volume work appearing towards the end\nof the nineteenth century (1886\u20131900) is Brugmann and Delbr\u00fcck\u2019s\nGrundri\u00df der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen\nSprachen. This represented the state of current knowledge at the\ntime, prior to the discovery of Anatolian and Tocharian early in\nthe following century. As it turns out, a considerable amount of\ntime would pass before the insights of Tocharian, and especially\nAnatolian, were to alter the picture of Indo-European.\nIn recent decades it has become clear that Anatolian was\nthe first to break off as a separate speech community (followed\nnext by Tocharian). Some of the morphologically rich categories\ncommon to (Vedic) Sanskrit and Greek are now thought to have\nbeen later innovations shared by the core inner-IE branches after\nthe breaking off of Anatolian (which appears to have lacked\nthem).\nA major ongoing area of study is the history and status of\nthe so-called -\u1e2bi and -mi conjugations in Anatolian and Indo-\nEuropean. In core Indo-European, only the familiar -mi conjuga-\ntion (cf. Gk \u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9 \u2018give\u2019) is attested, though, interestingly, the\nlong 1 sg. ending -\u03c9 of thematic verbs is standardly viewed as\ngoing back to *-o-h (with the laryngeal ending ultimately related\n2\nto the -\u1e2bi conjugation).10 Scholarship has demonstrated that the\nperfect tense-stem and the middle voice are clearly historically\nlinked to the Anatolian -\u1e2bi conjugation. The exact relationship is\n10 The so-called thematic verbs (much more common in Greek) belong\nto the same class as -mi verbs; compare the endings of Gk \u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9 with\nthe thematic verb bhar-a- \u2018bear; carry\u2019 in Sanskrit: 1 sg. bh\u00e1r-\u0101-mi (from\nearlier *bhar\u0101, cognate with Gk \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9), 2 sg. bh\u00e1r-a-si, 3 sg. bh\u00e1r-a-ti. 180 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\ncontroversial and has been much debated. A comprehensive\ntheory of the Indo-European verb, developed by Jay Jasanoff\nsince the 1970s, has been steadily gaining adherents (see Jasanoff\n2003).\n1.2. Semitic Studies\nHebrew and Aramaic, the languages of the Old Testament, belong\nto the Semitic family of languages, itself part of a larger grouping\ncalled Afro-Asiatic (which links Semitic with a number of lan-\nguages spoken in northern and central Africa).11 The immediate\nsub-branch to which both Hebrew and Aramaic belong is desig-\nnated Northwest Semitic. Also classified as Northwest Semitic is\nUgaritic, an extinct language spoken at Ugarit, a city state on the\nnorthern Levantine coast.12\nSemitic linguistics has been shaped by particular con-\nstraints and methodological challenges. Semitic languages are\ncharacterised by a distinctive concatenative morphology, which\nfeatures (mostly) triconsonantal verbal roots (C -C -C ) com-\n1 2 3\nbined with particular vowel patterns. For example, k-t-b \u2018write\u2019\n11 Afro-Asiatic linguistics is still in its infancy, and many of the non-\nSemitic languages are poorly known and poorly attested. Additionally,\nthe specific linguistic affiliation of the sub-branches is controversial.\n12 Discovered by accident in 1928, the archaeological site of Ugarit (Tell\nRas Shamra) has yielded thousands of cuneiform tablets and other\nsignificant artefacts. Ugaritic studies over the past century has offered\nimportant linguistic, cultural, and theological insights into the Old\nTestament. For a broad introduction to Ugaritic studies, see Watson and\nWyatt (1999). Historical Linguistics 181\ncombined with a particular vowel pattern to form a verbal adjec-\ntive in Proto-Semitic: *k\u0101tib- (Hebrew qal \u05d1\u05ea\u05b5 \u05bc\u05b9\u05db, Aramaic pe\u02bfal \u05d1\u05ea\u05b5 \u05db\u05bc\u05b8 ,\nUgaritic G-stem k\u0101tibu, Arabic form I k\u0101tibun). A different vowel\npattern with the same root yields a different grammatical form,\ne.g., the G-stem infinitive *kat\u0101b-. Unfortunately, the reconstruc-\ntion of the various vocalic patterns for both Proto-Semitic and\nintermediate branches is complicated by the fact that many\nancient Semitic writing systems tended to leave out vowels. The\nwritings of the Old Testament, for example, were originally\nwritten with a (largely) consonantal writing system, which was\nonly later supplemented by the medieval Masoretic notation\nsystem of vowels (niqqud).\nFor example, the exact vocalisation of the Ugaritic word \u0161d\n\u2018field\u2019 must be ascertained from other evidence (since the native\nUgaritic orthography is largely consonantal). Its reconstructed\nform in Proto-Semitic featured an intervocalic glide (between the\nsecond root vowel and the case vowel): *s\u0301adayum. The outcome\nof these so-called triphthong sequences varied from language to\nlanguage.13 In Biblical Hebrew, for example, III -\u05d4 nouns (origi -\nnally derived from III-y/w roots) feature word-final segol in\nthe absolute (e.g., \u05d4 \u05d3\u05b6 \u05e9\u05c2\u05b8 \u2018field\u2019), with regular loss of final *m\n13 The term triphthong (derived from diphthong) is somewhat of a misno-\nmer, as these sequences are better described from the standpoint of\nSemitic phonology as two vowels separated by an intervocalic glide:\nV wV and V yV .\n1 2 1 2 182 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\n(originally used in Proto-Semitic to indicate unbound nomi-\nnals).14 Fortunately, among the archaeological finds at Ugarit are\nnumerous cuneiform tablets which contain lists of Ugaritic words\nspelled with the logosyllabic orthography peculiar to Akkadian.\nOne such example is \u0161a-du-u \u2018field\u2019 (RS 20.123+), indicating to\nus that the outcome of this triphthong sequence in Ugaritic was\n/-\u016b/.\nAnother challenge historical linguists face in dealing with\nSemitic languages has been determining linguistic subgroupings.\nThe most important criterion for establishing a subgroup is\nshared innovations between languages. Unfortunately, the sig-\nnificant linguistic contact between Semitic languages in the rel-\natively small Middle East region has meant that genuine shared\ninnovations are often hard to distinguish from borrowings. For\nmore detail about the criteria of shared innovations, as well as\nthe two major models of linguistic affiliation (the tree and wave\nmodels), see \u00a72.1.4.\nImportant work by Robert Hetzron in the 1970s led to\nmainstream adoption of a Central Semitic node which, in the\ncurrent standard view, includes three main sub-branches: North-\nwest Semitic, Arabic, and Old South Arabian (\u1e62ayhadic). The\nprimary shared innovation justifying this node was the replace-\nment of the imperfective yaqa\u1e6d\u1e6dal verbal form with the yaq\u1e6dulu\nform (the ancestor of the familiar yiq\u1e6dol form in Hebrew).\nSome scholars have rejected Hetzron\u2019s model, pointing out\nthat there appears to be a set of shared features justifying a\n14 The less common biform \u05d9\u05d3\u05b7 \u05e9\u05bc\u05b8 \u2018field\u2019 indicates the original III -y root\nshape. Historical Linguistics 183\n\u2018south\u2019 Semitic branch.15 For example, Arabic, Old South Arabian,\nand Modern South Arabian, as well as Ethiopian, all exhibit a\ndistinctive *p > f sound change. Furthermore, the phenomenon\nof so-called \u2018broken\u2019 (or internal) plurals is widespread among\nthese languages, whereas it is less prevalent (and never occurs\nwithout an overt plural suffix) in Northwest Semitic. Huehnergard\nand Rubin (2011) argue persuasively that these (and other) fea-\ntures are in some cases trivial, while in other cases they provide\nevidence for intensive contact between the \u2018southern\u2019 languages\nafter the split of Central Semitic from the rest of West Semitic.16\nThe status of some other sub-groupings in Semitic also con-\ntinues to be debated. Potentially of interest to biblical scholars is\nthe ongoing discussion about the status of Aramaic, Ugaritic, and\nthe Canaanite dialects (including Hebrew) within Northwest\nSemitic (see Pat-El and Wilson-Wright 2018).\n2.0. Key Theoretical Commitments and Major\nConcepts\nIn historical linguistics, several crucial theoretical commitments\nare a necessary foundation for the investigation of language\nchange in all its dimensions. These are described below, followed\nby an exploration of some of the field\u2019s major concepts.\n15 The \u2018south Semitic\u2019 view was standard among earlier generations of\nSemitists.\n16 Kogan\u2019s recent detailed lexical study (2015) of Semitic isoglosses,\nincluding between Arabic and Northwest Semitic, finds additional sup-\nport for a Central Semitic node. 184 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\n2.1. Theoretical Commitments\nAny scientific discipline contains within it various assumptions\n(sometimes unstated or otherwise unknown to non-specialists)\nwithout which its specific concepts and methods could not\nbe coherent or justified. Four such primary commitments are\nsketched here.\n2.1.1. Pervasiveness of Language Change across All Levels\nHuman language is the object of all linguistic investigation. A sine\nqua non within the subfield of historical linguistics is the assump-\ntion that all natural human languages are everywhere and always\nsubject to continuous and perpetual language change at all levels.\nConsider the somewhat idealised Figure 1 below. All subsystems\nwithin a given language (whether phonetics, phonology, etc.) are\nsubject to change over time.17 This process is generally gradual\n(although it is not always uniform in intensity), such that speak-\ners do not generally perceive the change to be very great within\ntheir own lifetimes. Over a larger timespan, however, such as\ncenturies or millennia, the accumulated changes can result in\ndrastic differences.\n17 This neat segmentation is of course conceptual, and in reality all\nschools of linguistic thought acknowledge that the boundaries between\nlanguage domains are highly permeable and interconnected (hence\nterms such as morphosyntax, pragmatico-semantic, etc.). Historical Linguistics 185\nFigure 1: Multi-level language change\nTime\nLanguage states\nPhonetics Phonetics \u2026 Phonetics\n1 2 x\nPhonology Phonology \u2026 Phonology\n1 2 x\nMorphology Morphology \u2026 Morphology\n1 2 x\nSyntax Syntax \u2026 Syntax\n1 2 x\nSemantics Semantics \u2026 Semantics\n1 2 x\nPragmatics Pragmatics \u2026 Pragmatics\n1 2 x\nHistorical linguists assume that any natural language\u2014even if\npoorly understood or as yet unknown\u2014will be subject to this\nphenomenon.18\n2.1.2. The Regularity of Sound Change\nThe study of sound change lies at the heart of the discipline of\nhistorical linguistics. One key reason for this is the regularity of\nsound change in all human languages\u2014a far-reaching theoretical\ncommitment. Early nineteenth-century observers of language\nchange (e.g., Rasmus Rask, August Schleicher, Franz Bopp, etc.)\n18 In fact, one of the distinguishing factors in classifying languages as\n\u2018living\u2019 (as opposed to \u2018extinct\u2019 or \u2018dead\u2019) is whether they are (or were)\nin the process of undergoing change. Nevertheless, the classification of\na language as \u2018dead\u2019 is somewhat controversial, given phenomena such\nas the widespread use of Latin in medieval Europe, for example. 186 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nnoted systematic sound correspondences between sets of cognate\nvocabulary, leading them to postulate consistent sound laws to\naccount for these differences (see \u00a72.2.3. on the comparative\nmethod). The consistency of the sound correspondences was seen\nto apply across the board in a given language (for example, the\nsame sound change affected verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc., without\nexception). The regularity of sound change is largely what makes\nlinguistic reconstruction of prehistoric language states possible.\nIn its strongest form, this claim is linked to the nineteenth-\ncentury German Neogrammarians (Ger. Junggrammatiker), espe-\ncially expounded in Osthoff and Brugmann (1878).\nThe actual degree of regularity of sound changes is a topic\nof some controversy in historical linguistics. Some types of pro-\ncesses (for example, dissimilation and metathesis) appear to be\nless than fully regular. Closely tied to this issue is the question of\nthe actual locus of sound change. Does it take place mainly\nduring the language acquisition process of children? Or is it\nrather to be located in fluent adult speakers? Or both? What is\nthe relationship and interplay between \u2018regular\u2019 sound change\nand other types of change in language (especially analogy)? For\nour purposes, it is enough to note that most scholars accept a\ngeneral regularity in language sound change (what could be\nperhaps termed \u2018qualified exceptionlessness\u2019).\n2.1.3. Linguistic Reconstruction from Sound Change\nLinguistic reconstruction is the systematic recovery of chrono-\nlogically earlier language states (often thousands of years earlier).\nThis process includes proto-languages, intermediate daughter Historical Linguistics 187\nbranches, and all other intermediate language states. The end\ngoal of linguistic reconstruction is to provide as comprehensive a\nhistory as possible for a given language within its language\nfamily. This activity is a constant work-in-progress for scholars\nengaging with each language family, and in some cases, scholar-\nship has been working towards this goal for centuries.\nAlthough all levels of language are subject to change over\ntime as seen above, the investigation of sound change (phonetics\nand phonology) in language is agreed to be the major starting\npoint and the foundation for the entire enterprise of linguistic\nreconstruction. This is partly due to the regularity of sound\nchange, discussed above, but there are additional reasons. Lan-\nguage subsystems exist in a roughly hierarchical arrangement,\nhence sound change naturally becomes the foundation for other,\nhigher-level linguistic reconstruction. This is because higher lan-\nguage domains (such as morphosyntax) ultimately terminate at\nthe phonological/phonetic domains.\nAll syntactic constructions, for example, consist of a dis-\ncrete sequence of morphemes. Each morpheme in turn consists\nof a discrete sequence of phonemes (contrastive speech sounds\nwithin a given language).19 Finally, each phoneme is an abstract\nrepresentation of a set of phones (the final, phonetic domain),\nwhose distribution in the language is governed by complex lan-\nguage-specific rules.\n19 Naturally, some morphemes in languages can consist of only a single\nphoneme; but a conceptual distinction between the two is still\nnecessary. 188 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nAs an example, Figure 2 below illustrates the hierarchical\nrelationships in the Classical Greek present participle \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\n\u2018the things taking place\u2019.20 Notice that the complete word (level\nIII) consists of five discrete morphemes in the morphological\nlevel (II), of which the first, a present-stem reduplicant gi-, is\nespeciallly noteworthy.21 Finally, the five morphemes comprise\nnine distinctive phonemes in the phonological level (I).\nFigure 2: Morphological hierarchy of \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\nIII \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\nII gi- -gn- -o- -men- -a\nI /g/ /i/ /g/ /n/ /o/ /m/ /e/ /n/ /a/\nHowever, a consequence of this bottom-up schema is that any\nsound changes will have cascading consequences for higher-level\ndomains. For example, the historic loss of the preconsonantal\nphoneme /g/ in post-classical Greek (/gignomena/ > /g\u012bnomena/)\noccasioned compensatory lengthening of /i/ > [i\u02d0]. This is\nevidenced by the consistent spelling of {\u03b5\u03b9} in this and related\n20 This schema is necessarily simplified, and therefore does not capture\nthe internal hierarchical structures at each of the three levels.\n21 Not to be confused with the perfect-stem reduplicant C e- (cf. \u03b3\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1).\n1 Historical Linguistics 189\npresent-tense forms in the biblical manuscript tradition, e.g.,\nLuke 9.7: P7 5 \u05d0 D {\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1}.22\nThis change in the language, although originating at the\nphonetic/phonological level, has consequences for higher levels\nof the language. In place of a clear phonological boundary\nbetween the present-stem reduplicant gi- and the root -gn-, one\nobserves a new opaque present-stem g\u012bn-. Speakers would now\ninternalise a quasi-suppletive set of verbal stems (e.g., present\ng\u012bn- [\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9], aorist -gen- [\u1f10\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf], perfect -gon- [\u03b3\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5]). This\nnew structure is depicted in Figure 3 below.\nFigure 3: Revised morphological hierarchy of \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\nIII \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\nII g\u012bn- -o- -men- -a\nI /g/ /i\u02d0/ /n/ /o/ /m/ /e/ /n/ /a/\nFrom this illustration one sees the foundational role that sound\nchange plays in linguistic structures, as well as how it enjoys\na certain priority in historical linguistics. Although language\nchange can occur in any language domain, the most secure and\n22 See Williams (2018) for a defence of the view that {\u03b9} ~ {\u03b5\u03b9} spelling\ninterchanges are not uniformly haphazard, as is usually assumed (part\nof a larger phenomenon known as \u2018itacism\u2019). 190 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nlogical foundation for linguistic reconstruction is the phonetics/\nphonology domain (i.e., sound change).23\n2.1.4. Language Branching and Speech Communities\nA language or dialect is a more or less unified speech community\nwith a set of shared (though unconsciously accepted) conventions\nthat constitute a particular grammar. A grammar may be con-\nceived of as a collection of form-and-meaning pairings.\nThe language of such a speech community (say, speech\ncommunity x) undergoes innovations over time, such that all of\nits members (= speakers) essentially hold together linguistically.\nSuppose, however, that a separation takes place within this\nspeech community, such that in place of x there are now two\nseparate speech communities, y and z (typically separated by\ngeography). An important consequence of this development is\nthat all subsequent language change in speech communities y and\nz will be distinctive, unless language contact is reestablished\nbetween the communities. This is the central concept known as\nlanguage branching. See Figure 4 below for a standard model of\nNorthwest Semitic.\n23 In practice, this usually means that the most developed linguistic\nreconstructions tend to be phonological in nature, followed by morpho-\nsyntax and semantics (though these other, less well-developed areas of\nstudy in Indo-European historical linguistics have experienced signifi-\ncant advances in recent decades). Historical Linguistics 191\nFigure 4: Standard model of Northwest Semitic\nProto-Northwest-Semitic\nAramaic Canaanite Ugaritic\nHebrew Phoenician Moabite Ammonite\nOver time, the iterative branching process yields a family \u2018tree\u2019,\nwhere each \u2018twig\u2019 (or dialect) is linked to a larger series of \u2018bran-\nches\u2019 (or distinctive languages), while all branches ultimately\nconverge into a single \u2018trunk\u2019 (the proto-language).24 While all\nspeech communities are ultimately related to one another within\na given family, a hierarchical structure relates each language in\na more precise way that captures the individual relationships\nbetween any two members.\nOnce separated, the different changes that two speech\ncommunities undergo are generally not predictable beforehand.\nWithin a given language family, when speech communities are\nno longer in contact with one another, the changes they subse-\nquently undergo will not always be identical.25 The more time\n24 This specialised field, known as cladistics (from Gk \u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u2018branch\u2019), is\nalso important for several other non-linguistic scientific disciplines, for\nexample, textual criticism.\n25 An active topic of discussion among historical linguists is the degree\nto which linguistic trajectories can be mapped out, given the common\nstarting point of separated speech communities. In part, this depends\non whether language change is best characterised as prophylactic or 192 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nthat passes, the more distinctive each speech community becomes.\nHere, the imprecise, yet useful, terms dialect and language apply.\nGiven enough time, separated speech communities sharing a lan-\nguage will develop distinctive dialects. These dialects will grow\nprogressively less mutually intelligible, until, at some point, they\nare conventionally considered distinctive languages.26\nIn reality, this neat model is complicated by the phenom-\nenon of language contact between distinctive speech commu-\nnities. Prolonged language contact (whether minor or intensive)\ncan lead to new shared linguistic innovations over time. These\ninnovations (or isoglosses) can create challenges in the estab-\nlishment of linguistic affiliations between the languages of a\nlanguage family (as even in the example of Northwest Semitic;\nsee \u00a71.2).\nTo capture this reality, an alternative (but complementary)\nwave model has been used by historical linguists to account for\nfeatures and changes that spread throughout any speech commu-\nnities in contact with one another (whether they are linguistically\nhomogeneous or not). The metaphor of a spreading wave (or\nbetter: ripples in a pond) nicely illustrates how language change\nreparative. In other words, does language change primarily occur in\norder to avoid certain phenomena that are unconsciously disfavoured\nby speakers, or, rather, does language change occur as a subsequent tool\nfor repairing already existing changes which themselves are\ndisfavoured?\n26 Something of the imprecision in these categories may be observed\nwhen considering that the Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian,\nand Danish) are largely mutually intelligible, yet the numerous dialects\nof Modern Arabic or the varieties of Chinese are not. Historical Linguistics 193\nis often much more complex than imagined. The wave model is\npopular with dialectologists, especially in the context of the study\nof a dialect continuum (or language continuum). Many linguists\ntoday do not view the tree and wave models as mutually exclu-\nsive, but in fact as complementary, the former accounting for\ngenetic relationships, the latter accounting for subsequent exter-\nnal linguistic influences.\n2.2. Major Concepts\nBuilding on the previous section, the following is a necessarily\nbrief exploration of some of the methods and tools used by his-\ntorical linguists in their exploration of language change.\n2.2.1. The Role of Philology\nAs we have seen, linguistics was birthed in the context of the\nstudy of ancient languages, which is described in part as philol-\nogy. Nevertheless, historical linguistics eventually grew to be a\nseparate scientific discipline in its own right, distinct from phi-\nlology. Consequently, the term philology nowadays more properly\ndescribes the various tools employed by scholars (not just lin-\nguists) in order to study ancient texts. Philology, which has been\nneatly encapsulated as the art of reading slowly, includes diverse\ndisciplines such as archaeology, paleography, textual criticism,\nand other historical fields of inquiry.\nThese tools are still highly relevant for historical linguists,\nsince scholars prize the early written records of a language as a\nmeans of conducting linguistic reconstruction. Unfortunately, the 194 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nquality and accuracy of such data are uneven for the documenta-\ntion of a historically prior stage of a spoken language (irrespec-\ntive of whether that language is currently extinct or living).\nKnowledge about writing systems (paleography, etc.) is vital for\nunderstanding the conventions that native (and non-native)\nspeakers chose in representing a given language. Furthermore, if\nan ancient text can only be accessed by scholars as the product\nof a chain of textual transmission (i.e., scribal copying), the\ndiscipline of textual criticism must be employed in order to sort\nout genuine linguistic data from non-linguistic scribal errors or\nsupposed corrections that have arisen in the manuscript tradition.\nIn fact, any written representation of language, whether\nancient or modern, is always incomplete and imprecise due to\nvarious factors. To begin with, speakers do not require or depend\non a precise phonetic (or even phonological) transcription of lan-\nguage in order to achieve comprehension. An illustration of vari-\nous levels of transcriptional detail in the Masoretic system and\nthe International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is given in the example\nbelow.\n( 1) (a) \u05d5\u05e0\u05d3\u05e4\u05d0 (\u2018his palace\u2019; Dan. 11.45)\nConsonantal representation\n(b) \u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05d3\u05b0 \u05e4\u05b7 \u05d0\u05b7\nApproximate phonemic representation\n(c) /\u0294ap\u02d0adno/\nBroad (phonemic) IPA transcription\n(d) \u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u0594\u05d3\u05b0 \u05e4\u05b7 \u05d0\u05b7\nApproximate suprasegmental representation\n(e) [\u0294ap.pa\u00f0.\u02c8no\u02d0]\nNarrow (phonetic) IPA transcription Historical Linguistics 195\nVarying levels of detail and accuracy are presented for the hapax\n\u05d5\u05e0\u0594\u05d3\u05b0 \u05e4\u05b7 \u05d0\u05b7 \u2018his palace\u2019 (Dan. 11.45) in the example, on a spectrum from\n(a)\u2013(e). Notice, however, that each non-IPA representation is not\nfully consistent (hence the designation \u2018approximate\u2019). This is an\nartefact of complex historical factors. For example, the consonan-\ntal representation is not fully consonantal, since it includes a final\nvowel letter ( \u05d5\u2013).27 Additionally, while the Masoretic system itself\naccounts for vowel quality and generally indicates supraseg-\nmental stress, it does not record vowel length, even though this\nis generally thought to have been at least partly phonemic in\nTiberian Hebrew.28\nWhat is particularly interesting about this example, how-\never, is that it is plausibly one of a select few examples of a non-\naspirated /p/ in the entire Masoretic reading tradition of the Old\nTestament. We know from Latin and Greek transcriptions that the\nnormal pronunciation of \u05e4\u05b9 appears to have been not [p], but an\naspirated stop [p h], e.g., \u05d3\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05b7\u0596\u05b7\u05db\u05b0\u05e4\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b7 \u05d5\u05b0 (Gen 10:22) // \u0391\u03c1\u03c6\u03b1\u03be\u03b1\u03b4. Geoffrey\nKhan adduces testimony from the medieval grammarian Saadya\nGaon for the hapax legomenon \u05d5\u05e0\u0594\u05d3\u05b0 \u05e4\u05b7 \u05d0\u05b7 \u2018his palace\u2019 at Dan. 11.45,\n27 The use of vowel letters can be documented from the early first mil-\nlennium BCE, and it is generally thought that the initial point of contact\nwas the monophthongisation of particular diphthongs in Northwest\nSemitic. Thus, for example, *mawt {mwt} > m\u014dt {mwt} \u2018death\u2019 (cons.),\nwhere w came to represent \u014d.\n28 There has been something of a revolution in our understanding of the\nphonology of Tiberian Hebrew in recent decades, largely thanks to the\ndetailed work of Geoffrey Khan. For an excellent brief overview of the\nhistory of scholarly interpretation of the Masoretic vocalic system, see\nSuchard (2018). 196 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nwhich he describes as \u201cbetween bet and pe with dagesh\u201d (Khan\n2020, 215). This appears to be an attempt to capture the hearer\u2019s\nperception of a non-aspirated stop (since bet was not aspirated).\nKhan argues that the reading tradition for this loanword essen-\ntially inherited its non-aspiration from its Old Persian source\n(which lacked aspiration), probably with pharyngealisation, as a\nphonetic approximation of the loanword in Hebrew. Incredibly,\nthere is even some corroborating evidence for this pronunciation\nfrom Latin and Greek transcriptions: e.g., \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9 (Theodoretus,\nfifth century AD).29\nAs can be seen from just one example, historical linguists\nrely heavily on the methods and findings of philology in order to\ndo good linguistic work on language states that are inaccessible\nwith traditional field work methodology. The soundness of their\nreconstructions and theoretical models in large part depends on\nsound philological work.\n2.2.2. Borrowing30\nLinguistic borrowing is in fact a pervasive feature of many dis-\ntinctive speech communities in human societies, since they are\nfrequently in contact (sometimes extensive contact) with other\nlanguage communities. This contact can take many different\n29 For the full argument, as well as more complete evidence, see Khan\n(2020, 214\u201320).\n30 This discussion on borrowing is deliberately placed prior to the sec-\ntions that follow because discerning and eliminating borrowed linguis-\ntic material is an important criterion for establishing legitimate cor-\nrespondence sets when using the comparative method. Historical Linguistics 197\nforms. Sometimes it is limited and sporadic; at other times and\ncontexts it can be significant, such that a high level of bilingual-\nism exists between two speech communities.31 The term borrow-\ning generally refers to lexemes and semantic notions which are\ntransferred from one speech community to another. (Note that\nthis excludes other types of linguistic influence, such as syntax,\nwhich are no less genuine.)\nThe actual process of borrowing, like with other diachronic\naspects of language, is not instantaneous. A borrowed lexeme\nbegins life as a recognisably foreign element that over time may\nbecome progressively integrated into a speech community, such\nthat eventually its users will no longer perceive it as foreign, but\nperfectly native. When examining lexical material in a speech\ncommunity, or even in an ancient text (say, that of the Bible), it\nis important to ascertain where on the scale of adoption a given\nlexical item is diachronically situated (at the time of its usage).\nDepending on the analysis, foreign words in a text might be\ndescribed either as loanwords or alternatively as an example of\ncode-switching.\nA helpful illustration for understanding borrowing is the\nso-called \u2018Latinisms\u2019 in the Gospel of Mark. As shown in Table 2,\nthese include the following (adapted from Zeichmann 2017):\n31 Various complex factors (linguistic and non-linguistic) can play a role\nin determining the degree of contact, such as the linguistic relatedness\nof the two speech communities, their relative social ranking, and the\ndegree of societal integration between them. 198 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nTable 2: Latin-Greek Borrowing\nLatin Greek References (GMark)\ngrab\u0101tus \u2018cot\u2019 \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 2.4, 9, 11, 12; 6.55\nmodius \u2018a measure\u2019 \u03bc\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd 4.21\nlegi\u014d \u2018legion\u2019 \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd 5.9, 15\nspecul\u0101tor \u2018scout\u2019 \u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1 6.27\nd\u0113n\u0101rius \u2018a day\u2019s wage\u2019 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd 6.37; 12.15; 14.5\npugnus \u2018fist\u2019 \u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae 7.3\nsext\u0101rius \u2018a measure\u2019 \u03be\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 7.4\nc\u0113nsus \u2018census\u2019 \u03ba\u1fc6\u03bd\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 12.14\nCaesar \u2018Caesar\u2019 \u03ba\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1 12.14, 16, 17 [2\u00d7]\nquadr\u0101ns \u2018a coin\u2019 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 12.42\nvae \u2018woe\u2019 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b1\u03af 13.17; 14.21\nflagell\u014d \u2018to whip\u2019 \u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c9 15.15\npraet\u014drium \u2018palace\u2019 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd 15.16\ncenturi\u014d \u2018centurion\u2019 \u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd 15.39, 44, 45\nThe presence of so many Latin words in Mark\u2019s Gospel has been\ntaken by many commentators as fairly strong evidence for a\nRoman (i.e., Western) provenance for the writing. Other scholars,\nhowever, argue for a Syrian or Palestinian setting. Zeichmann\nexamines the character of these Latinisms and concludes that\nthey are poorly internalised borrowings. Some of the senses Mark\nuses for the Latin words are quite atypical (for example \u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae as\n\u2018hand\u2019). The very presence of Latinisms most likely indicates a\npost-70 CE writing date if in Palestine (when the Roman occu-\npation, the use of Latin, and the prevalence of Roman items, such\nas coins, increased dramatically). On the other hand, Mark\u2019s\nrather rough and irregular use of Latin words may indicate only Historical Linguistics 199\na rudimentary acquaintance with the language, which is con-\nsistent with a Roman provenance.32\nAnother application of studies in loanwords and linguistic\nborrowing for biblical studies is the use of loanwords to obtain\nrelative dates for the composition of a text. If the historical time\nperiod during which cultural and linguistic contact took place\nbetween two speech communities is known, in theory approxi-\nmate dates of composition could be assigned to texts containing\nparticular loanwords. For example, the presence of Greek loan-\nwords in the book of Daniel has frequently been used as an\nargument in favour of a Hellenistic-era composition. A recent re-\nexamination of the evidence by Benjamin Noonan (2018),\nhowever, argues that the phonological makeup of these Greek\nloanwords (mainly musical terms) indicates that they were bor-\nrowed from a non-Attic source (i.e., not the dialect which spread\nas a consequence of Alexander\u2019s Hellenisation). This debate illus-\ntrates that linguistic evidence can play a role in assessing the date\nof a text\u2019s composition, but that one should be cautious in relying\non such evidence for a conclusive decision (see \u00a73.0 below).33\n32 Zeichmann himself favours a post-war Syrian or Palestinian prove-\nnance, though this is on the assumption that \u201cthe author of Mark was\n[not] a Judaean denizen writing from Rome or a refugee of the Jewish\nWar\u201d (Zeichmann 2017, 47).\n33 A vivid illustration of such overconfidence is the famous assessment\nof S. R. Driver (1900, lxiii, emphasis original) with regard to the date\nof Daniel: \u201cThe verdict of the language of Daniel is thus clear\u2026 the\nGreek words demand, the Hebrew supports, and the Aramaic permits, a\ndate after the conquest of Palestine by Alexander the Great.\u201d 200 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\n2.2.3. The Comparative Method\nThe comparative method has already been mentioned, but in this\nsection it is explained in more detail, especially as a process. This\nis one of the most important tools historical linguists make use of\nwhen conducting research into a family of languages. As its name\nsuggests, the method involves a comparison of assembled lexical\nitems between two or more genetically related languages. It is\nimportant to state at the outset that the method is necessarily\niterative by nature, as several assumptions required by the\nmethod are themselves clarified in the course of implementing\nthe selfsame method. In the initial phase, of course, it may not\nnecessarily have been established that the languages in question\nare in fact related, as superficial resemblances are not enough to\nestablish such a link (since they could be chance similarities).\nHence, there is a necessary element of circularity in the method;\nan initial provisional hypothesis is usually sufficient to begin. The\npervasive presence of a core set of vocabulary that appears to be\nshared between two languages is a valid starting point for the\napplication of the comparative method.34\nThe first step involves the assembling of a list of lexical\nitems which are plausibly cognate with one another. At this stage,\nit is critical to exclude any borrowed lexemes in any language,\nsince they would inevitably skew the analysis (see the previous\nsection). This, too, is not always easy to accomplish, as there is a\n34 Sometimes the similarities between two languages have been much\nobscured by many layers of sound change. For example, it was not\nimmediately obvious to scholars that Old Irish was Indo-European until\nthe meticulous work of Franz Bopp. Historical Linguistics 201\ndegree of circularity in ascertaining which lexemes are borrowed\nand which ones are inherited.35 Table 3 below shows a sample\ncorrespondence set between Hebrew, Aramaic, and Ugaritic.36\nAlthough of course these three languages are now known to be\ngenetically related to one another, it is helpful to see exactly how\nthis claim can be established. As one examines the list of corre-\nspondences, certain observations emerge. (In the following, only\nthe voiced coronal consonants /d/, /z/, and /\u00f0/ will be exam-\nined, though the correspondence sets above also reveal other pat-\nterns.) Not only do most of the words look fairly similar to one\nanother, but particular patterns are evident.\nFor example, sometimes all three witnesses agree in sharing\nthe same consonant /d/: \u05dd\u05d3\u05bc\u05b8 | \u05d0\u05b9 \u05de\u05d3 | dm \u2018blood\u2019.

A final correspondence set, the relative/\ndemonstrative pronoun \u05d4\u05d6\u05b6 | \u05d9\u05d3\u05bc\u05b4 | \u1e0f/d reveals that Ugaritic appar-\nently features two (dialectal) outcomes of the same segment. All\nthese correspondences are then conveniently tabulated on a sep-\narate chart (Table 4 below). The next step is the analysis of the\nsets of segments in order to propose a single reconstructed pho-\nneme per set. The full agreement between the three languages\nwith regard to sets 1 (/z/) and 3 (/d/) allows us to hypothesise Historical Linguistics 203\nthat the immediate ancestor of the languages (Proto-Northwest-\nSemitic) featured a phonemic inventory with the same two seg-\nments: *z and *d.\nTable 4: Segment correspondence in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Ugaritic\nHebrew Aramaic Ugaritic\nSet 1 /z/\u05d6 / z/\u05d6 z /z/\nSet 2 /z/\u05d6 / d/\u05d3 \u1e0f /\u00f0/ ~ d /d/\nSet 3 /d/\u05d3 / d/\u05d3 d /d/\nThis is the most economical explanation, as it would be highly\nunlikely that each language independently innovated in the same\ndirection, resulting in such correspondences.\nSet 2, however, presents some challenges. Which segment\nought we to reconstruct? In the majority of cases, Ugaritic agrees\nwith Aramaic in sharing a /d/ segment (over against the /z/ of\nHebrew). The interesting case of the relative pronoun \u1e0f /\u00f0/, how-\never, reveals that in at least some cases, the reflex of this corre-\nspondence set in Ugaritic was a voiced interdental fricative. A\nfeature analysis (Table 5) shows that /\u00f0/, although a fricative, is\nnot a sibilant like /z/, and is therefore situated midway between\n/d/ and /z/. Cross-linguistic patterns further show that it is quite\ncommon for interdental fricatives to become sibilants (e.g., *\u00f0 >\n/z/; viz. Hebrew), or else to be \u2018strengthened\u2019 to a stop (e.g., *\u00f0\n> /d/; viz. Aramaic).\nTable 5: Feature analysis of /z/, / \u00f0/, and /d/\nCoronal Voiced Sibilant Stop\n/z/ + + \u05b9+ \u2013\n/\u00f0/ + + \u2013 \u2013\n/d/ + + \u2013 + 204 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nAs there is nothing apparent in the environment of these words\n(from the correspondence sets) to motivate a change in Aramaic\nor Ugaritic, we must instead hypothesise that an unconditioned\nmerger took place in Hebrew between *\u00f0 and *z (> /z/) that is\nabsent in Aramaic. Correspondingly, a separate unconditioned\nmerger must have taken place in Aramaic between *\u00f0 and *d (>\n/d/). The reconstructed segments in each of the correspondence\nsets are given below in Table 6 in the left column.\nTable 6: Reconstructed segments of *z, *\u00f0, and *d\nHebrew Aramaic Ugaritic\n*z \u05d6/z/ \u05b9 \u05d6/z/ z /z/\n*\u00f0 \u05d6/z/ \u05d3/d/ \u1e0f /\u00f0/ ~ d /d/\n*d \u05d3/d/ \u05d3/d/ d /d/\nThe results of this analysis indicate that Proto-Northwest-Semitic\nfeatured a series of three voiced coronal phonemes, which were\nreduced to two in Hebrew and Aramaic (though in different\nways).\n2.2.4. A Typology of Sound Change\nThe previous discussion illustrated the importance of understand-\ning the phonology of the segments in correspondence sets assem-\nbled between cognate languages. Additionally, knowledge of com-\nmon patterns of sound change in other languages provides valua-\nble information for the comparative method. This section pro-\nvides a brief overview of various types of phonological processes.\nA pervasive phenomenon in sound change is lenition, or\nconsonantal weakening. In general, consonantal segments fre-\nquently tend to change along certain common pathways, poten-\ntially leading to segment loss. In table 7 below, three different Historical Linguistics 205\nplaces of articulation (bilabial, alveolar, and velar) are arranged\nin parallel to show common pathways towards \u2205 (though other\npathways are also possible). For example, a common process in\nlanguages is for geminated segments to be degeminated. Voice-\nless (non-geminated) stops will often become voiced in the envi-\nronment of surrounding vowels (which are usually voiced in most\nlanguages).\nTable 7: Pathways towards consonantal weakening\nBilabial Alveolar Velar\nGeminate /p\u02d0/ /t\u02d0/ /k\u02d0/\nDegemination /p/ /t/ /k/\nVoicing /b/ /d/ /g/\nSpirantisation /\u03b2/ /\u00f0/ /\u0263/\nDebuccalisation /h/ /h/ /h/\nSegment loss \u2205 \u2205 \u2205\nThe final stage prior to segment loss is called debuccalisation, in\nwhich the oral segment loses its original place of articulation,\nmoving to the glottis (/h/).38\nConsider an example of lenition from Biblical and Byzantine\nGreek. The spelling of \u03a3\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 (m. gen. sg.) \u2018Silvanus\u2019 at 2 Cor.\n1.19, a loanword from Latin Silv\u0101nus /silwa\u02d0nus/, varies some-\nwhat in the manuscript tradition (in which we also find lunate\nsigma):\n(2) (a) \u03f2\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\nP46 c \u05d0 A B C K L P \u03a8 1739 rell\n(b) \u03f2\u03b9\u03bb\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\nP46* D F G\n38 A far less common cross-linguistic process than lenition is its reverse,\ncalled fortition. The change of *\u00f0 > /d/ in Aramaic is one such example. 206 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nThe spelling \u03f2\u03b9\u03bb\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 in (2b) indicates that for some later Byzantine\nscribes, the phoneme represented by {\u03b2} had already shifted from\na voiced stop /b/ to a fricative /\u03b2/, which was perceived as the\nclosest rendering of the Latin proper name (with /w/).39\nAnother common category of sound change is the loss of\nvocalic segments. Syllables which have lost articulatory promi-\nnence in words tend to lead to vowel reduction, and finally loss,\nwhich is called apocope. The loss of word-internal vowels is called\nsyncope. A pervasive example of apocope in Hebrew is the loss\nof old Semitic case vowels (e.g., nominative *malk-u, genitive\n*m alk-i, accusative *malk -a, all losing their final vowel in \u05da\u05b0\u05b9\u05dc\u05b6 \u05de\u05b6\n\u2018king\u2019).40\nThe juxtaposition of a consonantal segment next to a follow-\ning sound articulated close to the palate of the mouth (whether a\nvowel or consonant) leads to a common sound process in many\nlanguages called palatalisation. For example, in Pre-Greek, the co-\noccurrence of certain consonants before the palatal glide /j/\n(usually spelled as a y in English) led to a series of widespread\nsound changes, including changes in place of articulation (/l/ >\n/lj/, with a palatal co-articulation), changes in manner of artic-\nulation (stop > affricate), among others. The examples in (3)\n39 The IPA symbol for a voiced bilabial fricative is a Greek beta.\nManuscript data taken from Royse (2007, 852). Note that the use of\n{\u03bf\u03c5} is itself an attempt to render Latin /w/ in Greek.\n40 An intermediate step was the form *malk, which subsequently\ndeveloped an anaptyctic vowel to break up the final consonant cluster\n-lk. This widespread phenomenon in Hebrew is termed segolisation (after\nthe name of the final vowel seen in the so-called segolates). Historical Linguistics 207\nbelow in Greek are illustrations from various present formations\nwith the Indo-European *-jo- suffix (contrasted with aorist):\n(3) (a) *bal-jo- > *baljo- > *ba\u028e\u02d0o- > \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9 \u2018throw\u2019\n(present); *(e-)bal- > \u1f14\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (aorist)\n(b) *klep-jo- > *klepjo- > *klept\u0361\u0283o- > \u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 \u2018steal\u2019\n(present); *(e-)klep-sa- > \u1f14\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03c8\u03b1 (aorist)\n(c) *phulak-jo- > *phulakjo- > *phulat\u0361\u0283\u02d0o- > \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9\n\u2018guard\u2019 (present); *(e-)phulak-sa- > \u1f10\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03b1\n(aorist)\nA very common process in sound change is the assimilation\nof a segment (or segments) in part or in whole to the features of\nan adjacent segment. For example, in Biblical Hebrew hitpa\u02bf\u02bfel\nstems, certain features of the root-initial segment spread back-\nwards to the alveolar t of the stem prefix. This is referred to as\nregressive assimilation (the reverse is called progressive assimila-\ntion). For instance, the verbal root \u05e8\u05d1\u05d3 formed a hitpa\u02bf\u02bfel with\nregressive voicing assimilation: e.g., *mit-dabir- > *mid-dabir- >\n\u05e8\u05d1\u05bc\u05b5\u05a3\u05b5 \u05d3\u05b7 \u05de\u05bc\u05b4 (Num. 7.89).\nSometimes this assimilation in hitpa\u02bf\u02bfel stems was combined\nwith yet another (often seemingly sporadic) process called meta-\nthesis, which involves the exchange of two or more segments,\nsometimes even when they are non-adjacent. This is a well-known\nphenomenon in hitpa\u02bf\u02bfel stems with roots which begin with a\nsibilant. For example, the verbal root \u05e7\u05d3\u05e6 \u2018to be just\u2019 formed a\nhitpa\u02bf\u02bfel in which the emphatic feature of the root-initial sibilant\nspread to the adjacent dental of the prefix (assimilation). Addi-\ntionally, the emphatic sibilant was swapped with the dental pre-\nfix: *nit-s\u0323adiq- > *nis\u0323\u1e6dadiq- > \u05e7\u05d3\u05bc\u05b8\u0591\u05bc\u05b8\u05d8\u05b7 \u05e6\u05b0\u05e0\u05bc\u05b4 (Gen. 44.16; pausal form). 208 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\n2.2.5. Analogy\nIn some ways, the two great \u2018engines\u2019 of language change are\nsound change and analogy (often competing with one another in\nterms of their effect on a given language). Analogy may be\ndescribed as the process whereby speakers, in perceiving simi-\nlarities (potentially of various kinds) between two linguistic\nstructures, proceed to further advance the similarities in other\naspects of the same linguistic structures.\nFor example, some scholars hold that the weqa\u1e6dal form in\nBiblical Hebrew is perhaps an analogical development drawing\nfrom the wayyiq\u1e6dol. When final short vowels were lost, the Semitic\njussive-preterite form yaq\u1e6dul merged in most contexts with the\nimperfective yaq\u1e6dulu. In Biblical Hebrew, the old (short) yiq\u1e6dol\nlives on mainly in the wayyiq\u1e6dol form. The imperfective (long)\nyiq\u1e6dol, by contrast, is used to indicate various modal nuances, as\nwell as imperfective aspect. Later speakers, unaware of this ear-\nlier development, could have perceived in the prefixed waw of\nthe wayyiq\u1e6dol as having a \u2018converting\u2019 effect, transforming an\nimperfective yiq\u1e6dol into a perfective preterite (hence the waw-\nconversive terminology in some Biblical Hebrew pedagogy). The\nanalogy comes into play when speakers took the suffix conjuga-\ntion form, prefixed it with waw, and \u2018converted\u2019 its meaning from\nperfective to imperfective (i.e., the inverse of wayyiq\u1e6dol). Thus the\nwayyiq\u1e6dol, on this analysis, represents a direct historical develop-\nment of the original jussive-preterite yaq\u1e6dul, while the weqa\u1e6dal\nrepresents an analogical development that was constructed on\nthe model of wayyiq\u1e6dol. Historical Linguistics 209\nWhen engaging in the task of linguistic reconstruction, it is\ncritical to distinguish between genuine historical sound changes\nand various analogical effects (which sometimes even serve to\nundo particular sound changes in languages). One common form\nof analogy is paradigm levelling. Speakers over time tend to reduce\ninflectional distinctions in verbal or nominal paradigms, usually\ntriggered by various kinds of analogy. For example, the 3mp pre-\nfix conjugation in Ugaritic features a t- element (thus in contrast\nto the y- of Biblical Hebrew). An example may be cited from a\nletter, KTU 2.63: \u1ec9lm t\u0121rk t\u0161lmk \u2018may the gods (mp) guard you\n[and] keep you\u2019. Notice that both verbs have a masculine subject\n(\u1ec9lm \u2018gods\u2019), yet feature a t-prefix. Likewise, an Amarna Canaanite\nletter (EA 252) contains an unambiguous example of a 3mp prefix\nconjugation form with a t- element: ti-ma-\u1e2ba-s\u0323\u00fa-ka \u2018they strike\nyou\u2019.\nThis feature (from second millennium BCE Amarna Canaanite\nand Ugaritic) is used by Robyn Vern in part to argue against the\nview that there is such a thing as \u2018archaic\u2019 Biblical Hebrew Poetry.\nFor her, one would need to demonstrate the presence of traces of\nthis feature (among others) in Biblical Hebrew passages that are\npresumed to be archaic in order to sustain such a claim: \u201cIf there\nis sustainable evidence that there are second millennium rem-\nnants of the 3mp t-preformative, these poetic texts may be con-\nsidered of second millennium typology with regard to this par-\nticular linguistic feature\u201d (Vern 2011, 203).\nYet a consideration of two alternative models for the recon-\nstructed paradigm of the prefix conjugation in Northwest Semitic\nindicates that the change of *ya- \u2192 ta- is analogically justified 210 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nwith Reconstruction B, while the reverse is manifestly not under\neither A or B.41 It seems that paradigm levelling in Amarna\nCanaanite and Ugaritic was brought about by the pressure to\nunify all plural prefixes (apart from 1c) under ta-, a scenario\nfavouring Reconstruction B. See Figure 5 below for an illustration\nof this mechanism.\nFigure 5: Reconstructed paradigm of the prefix conjugation in\nNorthwest Semitic\nReconstruction A Reconstruction B\n3m *ya-q\u1e6dul-\u016b *ya-q\u1e6dul-\u016b\n3f *ya-q\u1e6dul-na *ta-q\u1e6dul-na\n2m *ta-q\u1e6dul-\u016b *ta-qtul-\u016b\n2f *ta-q\u1e6dul-na *ta-q\u1e6dul-na\n1c *na-q\u1e6dul *na-q\u1e6dul\nIn considering two alternative reconstructions, historical lin-\nguists generally favour paradigmatic heterogeneity (all things\nbeing equal).\nA final type of analogy to be discussed is folk etymology. A\nclassic example in Biblical Hebrew is the traditional rendering of\n\u05ea\u05d5\u05b6\u05de\u05bc\u05b8 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e6\u05b7 \u2018shadow of death\u2019, which occurs eighteen times in the Old\nTestament (most famously in Psalm 23.4). This understanding is\nbased on a morphological segmentation \u05dc\u05e6 \u2018shadow\u2019 + \u05ea\u05b9 \u05d5\u05de\n\u2018death\u2019. Such an interpretation is already seen in the ancient\ntranslations, e.g., the Septuagint (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u2018shadow of\ndeath\u2019) and the Ta rgums (\u05d0\u05ea\u05d5\u05de\u05d3\u05b9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d8 \u2018the shadow of death\u2019) . Its\n41 Some scholars make use of an arrow (\u2192) or a double greater-than\nsign (\u226b) in order to distinguish analogical change from sound change\n(>). Note that Reconstruction A is based on the homogeneity (with *ya-\n) exhibited by all major, early languages. Historical Linguistics 211\nparallels in poetry, however, imply that the word is somehow\nassociated with darkness, which is not a necessary interpretation\nof the phrase \u2018shadow of death\u2019. An apparent cognate in Ugaritic,\n\u0121 lmt \u2018darkness\u2019 (variant spelling \u1e93lmt), suggests that \u05ea\u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05e6 should\nprobably be segmented as a derivative in -\u016bt from an unattested\nstative root \u05dd\u05dc\u05e6* \u2018to be dark\u2019 (cf. Akkadian s\u0323al\u0101mu \u2018to be dark\u2019).\nOne can grasp by this example how folk etymology works. It\noccurs when speakers accidentally reinterpret a word or a phrase\nby morphological resegmentation. The original word \u05ea\u05d5\u05bc\u05de\u05dc\u05b0 \u05e6\u05b7*\n\u2018darkness\u2019 would have been reanalysed as \u05dc\u05e6 \u2018shadow\u2019 + \u05ea\u05b9 \u05d5\u05de\n\u2018death\u2019, leading to sound change ( \u05ea\u05d5\u05bc\u05de- > \u05ea\u05d5\u05b6\u05de\u05bc\u05b8 -) that appears to be\nirregular.\n2.2.6. Other theoretical concepts\nSpace precludes discussion of the many other kinds of language\nchange (including syntactic change and semantic change), as well\nas additional methods historical linguists use to recover such\nchanges (for example, internal reconstruction). As with many\nother fields of linguistics, historical linguistics is a broad field,\nwith many sub-disciplines. Scholars continue to make progress in\na number of increasingly specialised fields, while at the same\ntime interdisciplinary approaches are growing in popularity,\neven drawing on fields outside of linguistics (for example,\nthe recent application of Bayesian phylogenetics to language\nclassification). 212 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\n3.0. Historical Linguistics in Biblical Studies\nThe methods and tools of historical linguistics have been applied\nto biblical studies with ever growing intensity over the past few\ndecades. The main area of application by far has been the Old\nTestament, which by its nature is arguably more amenable to\nsuch research. Despite this, improvement in work done in both\nthe Old and New Testaments is a desideratum, as some of it can\nbe uninformed at times about a number of generally accepted\nassumptions of historical linguistics.\nWithin Old Testament studies, historical linguistics has\nbeen applied most significantly (and increasingly controversially)\nto the question of the dating of its various texts. Fassberg (2016)\noffers an excellent overview of the history of scholarship in this\narea. He outlines three major time periods, the first beginning\nin the nineteenth century with the publication of Gesenius\u2019\nGeschichte der hebr\u00e4ischen Sprache und Schrift (1815) and con-\ncluding with the publishing of the first fragments of Ben Sira in\n1896 by Solomon Schechter. The second period continues with\nthe incorporation of the insights about the language of Ben Sira,\nas well as that of the Damascus Document (published in 1910),\nuntil the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) in 1947. The\nthird period continues unto the present day, as the data about the\nDSS and especially the language contained in its non-biblical\ntexts continues to be analysed. Especially noteworthy are the\nrigorous methodological principles for dating texts developed by\nAvi Hurvitz and continued by his students. A significant mono-\ngraph that represents the cumulation of this research is Hurvitz\u2019s\nlexicon of Late Biblical Hebrew (2014). Historical Linguistics 213\nRezetko and Young (2019) argue persuasively that a fourth\nperiod may be discerned, which began in the 2000s. Within this\ncurrent period, the heretofore accepted practice of dating biblical\ntexts by means of linguistic features began to be seriously chal-\nlenged by a number of scholars, most particularly in a series of\nworks by Ian Young, Robert Rezetko, and Martin Ehrensv\u00e4rd\n(Young, Rezetko, and Ehrensv\u00e4rd 2008; Rezetko and Young\n2014). Their work has generated intense debate and fresh research\nin this area. In the last decade, several major monographs on the\nquestion of diachrony in biblical Hebrew have emerged (e.g.,\nMiller-Naud\u00e9 and Zevit 2012; Moshavi and Notarius 2017).\nAlthough a definitive consensus has not yet emerged from all the\ndebate, the discussions have fostered much more methodological\ncaution in deriving actual dates (or even rough time periods)\nfrom the results of investigations into the language of particular\ntexts of the Old Testament. To take but a single example, consider\nthe presence of the apparent Aramaism \u05d5\u05bc\u05b9 \u05e0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b7 \u05d9\u05b0 \u2018they recount\u2019 (Judg.\n5.11) in the linguistically archaic Song of Deborah and Barak.42\nThe presence of Aramaisms in Biblical Hebrew texts is typically\ntaken to be evidence of a late date of composition. Yet this is\nprobably an oversimplification, since there would have been\nearly language contact between Aramaic-speaking peoples and\nthose of Canaanite stock (such as Biblical Hebrew speakers). Such\nforms indicate that care must be taken in assigning dates to the\nlanguage of biblical texts.\n42 The Old Greek rendering \u03b4\u03ce\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u2018they give\u2019 appears to be an\nalternative vocalisation reflecting an expected \u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05ea\u05b0 \u05d9\u05bc\u05b4. 214 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nAn overall assessment of the debate can be briefly offered\nhere. It seems that the confidence exhibited by an earlier genera-\ntion of scholars has been tempered somewhat. (One thinks of\nDriver\u2019s [1900, lxiii] famously confident assertion about the dat-\ning of Daniel over a century ago, also mentioned in \u00a72.2.2 above:\n\u201cThe verdict of the language of Daniel is thus clear\u2026 the Greek\nwords demand, the Hebrew supports, and the Aramaic permits, a\ndate after the conquest of Palestine by Alexander the Great\u201d\n[emphasis original].) Even if absolute dates for language states\ncould be established, there is no exact correspondence between\nlanguage states and ancient biblical texts, which are composite\ndocuments received via centuries of textual transmission.\nFurthermore, the contributions of scholars such as Gary\nRendsburg have helpfully introduced the dialectal dimension to\nthe diachronic debate: the language variation we see in the Old\nTestament text should not only be attributed to diachronic fac-\ntors. To this might also be added other sociolinguistic phenomena\nsuch as register and even an author\u2019s idiolect.\nAt the same time, the extreme scepticism of Rezetko, Young,\nand Ehrensv\u00e4rd seems unwarranted. As Aaron Hornkohl (2017,\n75) notes: \u201cWe may\u2026 reasonably accept that BH has a history\nand that the general lines of this history may be traced in the\nMasoretic editions of biblical literature.\u201d The textual tradition for\nthe Old Testament is reasonably secure (certainly for the pur-\nposes of detecting diachronic change). The Masoretic tradition\nhas been demonstrated to have faithfully preserved minute lin-\nguistic nuances (even comparing favourably to many earlier texts Historical Linguistics 215\nfrom the Dead Sea, which exhibit a degree of linguistic updating\nand harmonisation).\nThe scholarship of Avi Hurvitz and his students has pro-\nduced fairly rigorous criteria for evaluating potential diachronic\nchanges. For example, the criterion of linguistic opposition estab-\nlishes evidence for real linguistic change in the complementary\ndistribution of lexemes such as \u05e9\u05e9\u05b5 \u2018linen\u2019 (Classical Biblical\nHebr ew) and \u05e5\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1 \u2018linen\u2019 (Late Biblical Hebrew). Furthermore,\nalthough the extra-biblical evidence is meagre, it corroborates\nthe picture we see within the biblical texts.\nIn short, while the vigorous debate in recent decades has\nproduced positive improvements in methodology and it has help-\nfully tempered some of the more confident claims of an earlier\ngeneration of scholarship, it does not seem to have overturned\nthe basic consensus: the Old Testament is a collection of texts\nproduced over a period of several centuries, and these texts give\nevidence of diachronic linguistic development.\n4.0. Prospects for Further Study and Application\nNo such equivalent application of the methods and tools of his-\ntorical linguistics currently exists in New Testament studies. New\nTestament Greek, however, is a potential growth area and histori-\ncal linguistics may well provide some tools for better understand-\ning the Greek verb (especially from its Indo-European vantage\npoint). A promising development in this regard is the recent pub-\nlication of The Greek Verb Revisited by editors Steven Runge and\nChristopher Fresch (2016). Within this collection of essays, one 216 Ozoli\u0146\u0161\nsees a new focus on the diachronic dimension as a necessary dia-\nlogue partner in the serious current scholarly disputes of the\nnature of the Koine Greek verb (see in particular the essays by\nRutger Allen, Peter Gentry, and Amalia Moser).\nHistorical linguistics as a discipline stands as a welcome\ntool to scholars of all backgrounds engaged in the study of the\nbiblical languages (as well as other ancient languages). Even the\nstudy of a single time period of a language is the study of a lan-\nguage in a state of perpetual (though gradual) diachronic flux\nand transition. This chapter has hopefully demonstrated that the\ntools and methods that historical linguists employ can be profit-\nably used by biblical scholars as a means of advancing the state\nof our exegetical and historical knowledge of the biblical texts.\n5.0.

Introduction\nThe application of computational linguistics to the Bible is part\nof the broader field of \u2018Bible and Computer\u2019 as it was coined in\nthe 1970s and which encompasses, besides linguistic research, an\never-increasing field of computational textual analysis applied to\nthe biblical text. It takes place at the intersection of biblical stud-\nies and the rapidly developing field of Digital Humanities.\nThis chapter deals with computational linguistics as a\nmethod, besides the other methods described in this volume. It\nshould be recalled, however, that computational linguistics is\ninterwoven with other approaches. When we compare the vari-\nous available syntactic databases of the Hebrew Bible, we can\nobserve, for example, that of the three most well-known data-\nbases the Andersen\u2013Forbes database is explicitly eclectic in its\nlinguistic theory (cf. Andersen and Forbes 2012).1 On the other\n1 For project documentation and bibliographical references, see\nhttp://andersen-forbes.org, accessed 1 May 2023.\n\u00a9 2023 Kaspars Ozoli\u0146\u0161, CC BY-NC 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358.05 224 van Peursen\nhand, the ETCBC database or BHSA (cf. Kingham and Van Peursen\n2018) builds on the form-to-function approach developed by\nJaap Hoftijzer and Wolfgang Richter (Van Peursen 2007, 140\u2013\n41) and is influenced by the text-syntactic approach developed\nby Harald Weinrich and Wolfgang Schneider (Van Peursen\n2020a, 140\u201355). Holmstedt\u2019s and Abbegg\u2019s Accordance Hebrew\nSyntax Database (Holmstedt and Cook 2018) is highly informed\nby generative linguistics (Accordance documentation 2014).2\nBecause of these observations, it would be an oversimpli-\nfication to treat computational linguistics as a method distinct\nfrom, for example, generative linguistics or Cognitive Linguistics.\nEach computational linguistic analysis uses a digital corpus and\neach of these corpora is rooted in linguistic theories (see below,\n\u00a72.3). Moreover, computational linguistics is a broad field that\nincludes various approaches such as rule-based computer-science,\nstatistics, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning.3 All these\napproaches have been applied to the biblical languages, and\nhence this chapter will present various approaches rather than\none single method. Nevertheless, we shall see that these com-\nputational approaches have some common features that justify\ntreating them together and that they have developed further in\nways that are typical for computational corpus linguistics and go\n2 For other database projects on Biblical Hebrew that were active over\nthe last decades see Kroeze (2013).\n3 In addition, computational linguistics as a discipline also covers\napproaches such as speech recognition or natural language generation\nthat fall outside the scope of the current chapter. For an overview see,\ne.g., Clark, Fox, and Lappin (2010); Jurafsky and Martin (2021). Computational Linguistic Analysis 225\nbeyond the linguistic theories underlying the annotations in the\nrespective databases. This reality justifies a separate chapter in\nthe current volume devoted to computational linguistics as a\nmethod by itself.\n1.2. The Beginnings\nFrom our remarks in the introduction, it will be evident that it is\nimpossible to give a historical survey of the application of compu-\ntational linguistics to Biblical Hebrew without considering the\nwider context. This is the context of text and computing as an\nemerging field of studies in the twentieth century. Leaving aside\nfor the moment predecessors such as the mechanical machines\nthat were made, or at least designed, in the nineteenth century,\nsuch as the design for a mechanical general-purpose computer by\nCharles Babbage, we will start this survey with the emergence of\nthe forerunners of the modern computers in the 1940s and 1950s.\nIn this period, we see the transformation of the calculation\nmachine into the universal machine: that is, a machine that can\ndo any task for which it is programmed. In these early years,\nRobert Busa started his famous project of the Index Thomisticus,\nwhich involved the complete lemmatisation of the works of\nThomas Aquinas (which consists of 181 works, comprising 11\nmillion words). This monumental project started in 1949 and\nlasted about thirty years.\nThe first universal computers created were not primarily\nmeant for text processing. It should be recalled that the combi-\nnation of text/language and computation/calculation is not as\nself-evident as it now seems. Even long before the emergence of 226 van Peursen\ncomputers, the fuzziness and ambiguity of natural language frus-\ntrated projects like those of Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716), who\nfor \u201chis whole life\u2026 continued to believe in the construction of\na language consisting of logical symbols that could be manipu-\nlated by means of a calculator. Such a language, and a machine\nto \u2018calculate\u2019 it, would enable any philosophical debate to be\nsettled with the click of a button\u201d (Van der Weel 2011, 106).\nLikewise, \u201caround a hundred years ago, polymaths like Bertrand\nRussell were furiously fighting to capture the nuances of lan-\nguage with a view to developing a universal formal language,\u201d\nwhich remained an ongoing academic pursuit that continued in\nthe field of computer science, but appeared to be a highly chal-\nlenging project (see action.ai 2021).\nIt was only in the 1960s and the 1970s that the marriage\nbetween computer and text took place. In the 1960s, computers\nbecame able to process text. A milestone was the first edition of\nthe ASCII standard in 1963. This standard involved a 7-bit encod-\ning in which, for example, 1000000 stands for @, 1000001 for\nA, and 1000010 for B, and 1000011 for C. In total, the ASCII\nstandard contained 128 codes. Accordingly, the first attempts to\ncreate electronic versions of the Hebrew Bible had to accommo-\ndate this standard.\nThese attempts started in the 1970s. In 1970, Francis\nAndersen and Dean Forbes started a project that finally resulted\nin the Andersen\u2013Forbes database. In the same year, Christof Felix\nHardmeier (1970) from Greifswald reported on his own experi-\nments in his article on the new potential of electronic data\nprocessing. Somewhat later, in 1977, the Werkgroep Informatica Computational Linguistic Analysis 227\nVrije Universiteit (WIVU) was established in Amsterdam under\nthe guidance of Eep Talstra (after whom the WIVU was rebap-\ntised as the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer [ETCBC]\nin 2013), which marked the start of the WIVU/ETCBC database.\nAt Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, J. Alan\nGroves started pioneering work which initiated the research at\nwhat is now called the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Bibli-\ncal Research. This work resulted in the Westminster Leningrad\nCodex (first released in 1987), to be followed by the Westminster\nHebrew Morphology (also known as the Groves-Wheeler mor-\nphology) and the Westminster Hebrew Syntax.\nPioneers such as Andersen, Forbes, Hardmeier, and Talstra\nfound each other in the Association Internationale Bible et\nInformatique (AIBI), which was established in 1982 and held its\nfirst conference in 1985 in Louvain-la-Neuve. Besides the pio-\nneers already mentioned (and others such as Marc Vervenne or\nEmanuel Tov), a driving force behind this organisation was R. F.\nPoswick from the Benedictine monastery of Maredsous. The\ntheme of the first AIBI conference was \u2018the text\u2019, and that was\nprecisely the main challenge during those years: how to represent\nthe Hebrew text and linguistic annotations. There was no\nUnicode, no markup language like HTML and XML, and not even\na PC back then. The first challenge these pioneers faced was\nbuilding electronic text corpora, displaying them on the screen,\nand handling the right-to-left writing direction for Hebrew. 228 van Peursen\n1.3. Interface, Office and Network\nMajor changes took place in the 1980s and 1990s, which were\nrelated to such terms and abbreviations as GUI (Graphical\nUser Interface), the DTP (Desktop Publishing) revolution, and\nWYSISWYG (What You See Is What You Get). These changes can\nbe illustrated by the introduction of the Apple Lisa in 1983, the\nfirst version of the program PageMaker in 1984, and the first\nrelease of Microsoft Office in 1989. These developments marked\na change in the application of the computer towards more office-\nrelated activities. With this development, the use of the computer\nbecame much more widespread, both in number of users and in\ntypes of applications. In the field of biblical studies this resulted\nin the appearance of software packages such as BibleWorks (first\nrelease in 1992) and Accordance (first release in 1994).\nThese new tools became extremely helpful for biblical\nscholars. One could now display the Hebrew Bible and the\nancient versions side by side, search for words and word com-\nbinations in the electronic text instead of consulting a printed\nconcordance, and store large commentaries on one\u2019s disk rather\nthan on one\u2019s bookshelves.4 A side-effect of this development,\nhowever, was a shift of focus. The early pioneers of \u2018Bible and\nComputer\u2019 were mainly concerned with the computer as an ana-\nlytical tool, but in practice, it rather became a useful office tool.\nBeing able to search for a word with a query instead of looking\n4 But often, again, the computer was used to generate concordances that\nwere published in print. Thus, e.g., Postma, Talstra, and Vervenne\n(1983); cf. Oosting (2016, 195). Computational Linguistic Analysis 229\nit up in a printed concordance may be a little bit faster, but it\nis not a methodological improvement. A burning question that\noccupied the early pioneers but seemed to be hardly a concern\nfor the broader community of biblical scholars was: How can we\ngo beyond the imitation of the traditional instruments?5\nAnother effect of the developments in the 1980s described\nhere was that some of the databases that were initiated in the\n1970s and 1980s became commercial products. To my best\nknowledge, it is only the ETCBC database that is publicly avail-\nable,6 while the Andersen\u2013Forbes database is only available in\nthe commercial Bible software packages of Logos and Accord-\nance, and the more recent Holmstedt\u2013Abbegg database only in\nAccordance.7 This has hindered further development within the\nscholarly community, because one of the primary conditions of\n5 See the telling title of Talstra and Dyk (2006): \u2018The Computer and\nBiblical Research. Are there Perspectives beyond the Imitation of\nClassical Instruments?\u2019\n6 https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa, accessed 4 May 2023. Recently, also\nthe MACULA Hebrew syntax trees have become available at https://\ngithub.com/Clear-Bible/macula-hebrew, accessed 4 May 2023. These\nsyntax trees have been developed by Clear Bible, Inc. together with the\nGroves Cente and build on the Westminster Hebrew Syntax Without\nMorphology and the Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible morphology (serv-\ning in place of the Westminster Hebrew Morphology). The Groves\nCenter has also released the Westminster Hebrew Syntax Without\nMorphology at https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-hebrew/tree/\nmain/sources/GrovesCenter, accessed 4 May 2023.\n7 Cf. Accordance documentation (2014), for the advantages that\nHolmstedt and Abbegg considered for integrating their database into\nthe Accordance software right from the start. 230 van Peursen\ncomputational linguistics is that the analyses are retrievable and\nthat the underlying algorithms are available on online platforms\nsuch as GitHub (cf. below, \u00a74.3).\nIn the 1990s, a new element radically changed the digital\nlandscape: networking. The World Wide Web was launched in\n1991 and in the same year the first version of Unicode was\nreleased. These two milestones were closely related, because only\nwith the unequivocal definition of characters in Unicode was it\npossible to exchange text that remained stable regardless of the\nenvironment in which it was read. For PC users, the internet\nbecame accessible through the browsers that came onto the mar-\nket, such as Netscape Navigator in 1994 and Internet Explorer in\n1995.\nThis new development was also soon picked up by biblical\nscholars. Electronic journals in the field of biblical studies were\ninitiated, such as TC: A Journal of Biblical Textual Criticism and\nthe Journal of Hebrew Scriptures, which both started in 1996.8\nAt the turn of the century, a new stage started with the\nintroduction of more interactive forms of publication and com-\nmunication, in which the users became both consumers and\ncontributors and in which the dividing line between information\nconsumption and information creation was blurred. This is often\nlabelled \u2018Web 2.0\u2019. Milestones include the launch of Wikipedia\n(2001) and the emergence of social media such as Facebook\n(2004) and Twitter (2006).\n8 Mention should also be made here of Hugoye, a journal in the field of\nSyriac studies, which started in 1998. Computational Linguistic Analysis 231\nThis ever-growing field of textual and social computer\napplications affected biblical studies. The use of electronic tools\nwas no longer the privilege of biblical scholars. More and more,\neveryone had an increasing number of online Bibles and Bible\nstudy tools at their disposal. Likewise, the field of \u2018Bible and Com-\nputer\u2019, as defined by the AIBI, was expanding as well. At the sixth\nAIBI conference held in Stellenbosch in 2000, there were sections\non grammar, statistics, and discourse, but also on education,\nmulti-media, publishing, and community, all in relation to the\nBible and the computer.\n1.4. Reorientation: Methodological Innovation?\nThe development described above was not the programme that\nthe pioneers of the 1970s and 1980s had in mind when they\nstarted their work. A re-orientation took place in the first decade\nof the twenty-first century. The seventh AIBI conference (con-\nvened by Marc Vervenne, Leuven, 2004) and the eighth confer-\nence (convened by Luis Vegas Montaner, Madrid, 2008) were\nboth presented as expert meetings focusing on the question of\nhow the computer can play an innovative role in biblical schol-\narship.9 How could the computer be used as an analytical tool,\nrather than merely as a library, an office tool, and an imitation\nof traditional tools, which it apparently had become in the\n1990s?\nThe question regarding the role of the computer in meth-\nodological innovation touched upon the more encompassing\n9 See the overview given in Poswick (2010), but note that the Leuven\n2004 conference is absent from Poswick\u2019s overview. 232 van Peursen\nquestion regarding textual scholarship as a humanities discipline\nin relation to computer science, which typically belongs to the\nsciences. Computation and the related scientific mode of inquiry\ngave the ability to sort, quantify, reproduce, and report text, but\nhow could this be fruitfully combined with interpretation as the\nvalued mode of assigning or discovering meaning as understood\nin traditional scholarship and the related reflexive concepts of\nindividualism and subjectivity (Van Peursen 2010)?\nThe final decades of the twentieth century had witnessed a\nshift in the humanities from the hermeneutic and critical tradi-\ntion of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries towards the identi-\nfication and representation of patterns by digital means in the\nsecond half of the twentieth and the early years of the twenty-\nfirst century. Rens Bod (2013) coined the two phases \u2018Humanities\n1.0\u2019 and \u2018Humanities 2.0\u2019. (Note that \u20182.0\u2019 is used here differently\nto in \u2018Web 2.0\u2019 discussed above). Humanities 1.0 embodied the\ntraditional understanding of the humanities as it was framed at\nthe end of the nineteenth century. Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911)\nand others advocated a clear-cut distinction between the humani-\nties and the sciences, the first mainly involved in Verstehen\n(understanding) the second in Erkl\u00e4ren (explanation). This dis-\ntinction had a significant impact on modes of scholarship, but\nalso on the organisation of academia, where most institutions\nhave separate departments for the humanities and the sciences.\nWith the appearance of the computer as a tool for textual schol-\narship (Humanities 2.0), this distinction was blurred. How could\nthis distinction be maintained now that computer scientists\nseemed to be analysing texts in the same way in which natural Computational Linguistic Analysis 233\nscientists analysed DNA structures? Rens Bod (2013, 177) has\nargued that this new mode of scholarship should not be the end\npoint, but that a next step should be taken (which he labelled\nHumanities 3.0), in which Humanities 1.0 and Humanities 2.0\nare combined and in which the hermeneutic and critical tradition\nof Humanities 1.0 should be applied to the tools and patterns\nobtained by Humanities 2.0.\n1.5. From Rule-Based Analysis to Machine Learning\nWhile biblical scholars and textual scholars in general were busy\nincorporating computer science into their disciplines, computer\nscience itself developed further with astonishing speed. Let us\nillustrate this with the example of machine translation. From the\nearly days of computational linguistics, it was evident that it\nwould be tremendously useful if the computer could be used to\ntranslate a text from one language into another. As early as the\n1970s, attempts were made to achieve this task by rule-based\nmachine translation. In this approach, the input that the com-\nputer receives is the text to be translated and language rules.\nThese rules include, for example, a bilingual lexicon, mor-\nphology, and syntax. The more refined those rules, the fewer\nerrors the translation contains and the better it becomes. How-\never, after decades of improvements, the results did not meet the\nhigh expectations. Natural language appeared more unruly than\npeople thought (cf. above, \u00a71.1). The rule-based techniques of\nthe 1970s to the 1990s were replaced by statistical approaches in\nthe 1990s until the 2010s. However, although there was sig-\nnificant progress, the real breakthrough came only with the 234 van Peursen\napplication of machine learning. Here the input is no longer a\ntext to be translated and a set of rules to carry out this task, but\nrather a large collection of training data, in this case of parallel\ntexts in two languages, from which the computer itself can learn\nhow to translate. Although the mechanisms that are at work are\nlargely hidden, the performance is outstanding.\nIf we define machine learning more precisely, we can say\nthat it is the ability to learn without being explicitly pro-\ngrammed. It is a subgroup of Artificial Intelligence, which refers\nto any technique that enables computers to mimic human behav-\niour or, more precisely, the effort to automate intellectual tasks\nnormally performed by humans. Artificial Intelligence (AI) went\nthrough various stages by itself, from symbolic AI, which was\nprevalent until the 1980s and involved the application of explicit\nrules and the manipulation of logic, to machine learning, where\nthe computer goes beyond the instruction and rules it is given\nand learns by itself how to perform a certain task. A subgroup of\nmachine learning is deep learning, which refers to the extraction\nof patterns from data with the help of neural networks. In the\ncase of machine learning, we can distinguish between supervised\nmachine learning, in which the machine learns from human-\nlabelled examples, and unsupervised learning, in which the\nmachine has to detect patterns in the unlabelled data by itself.\nSupervised methods include attempts for text classification. In\nbiblical studies, an example is Dicta (see n. 10), which provides\nan exciting collection of tools for author recognition and text\nclassification, such as the Tiberias Stylistic Classifier (cf. below, Computational Linguistic Analysis 235\n\u00a7\u00a72.5 and 3.3).10 These tools can be used, for example, to classify\na text of debated origin along the lines of early and late Biblical\nHebrew.\nExperts may challenge the rather simple definitions given\nhere for machine learning, deep learning, and Artificial Intel-\nligence, and there is much debate about the exact nature and\ndefinitions of the various designations given here. But the main\npoint to be made is that a major shift has taken place, which\naffects our whole understanding of using the computer in linguis-\ntic analysis. Elsewhere I have suggested that the transformations\nthat are taking place now with the transition from rule-based\napproaches to machine learning may even mark a more drastic\ndiscontinuity with existing methods of biblical interpretation\nthan the appearance of the computer as an exegetical tool in the\nlast decades of the twentieth century (Van Peursen 2020b, 310).\nWhereas many of the rule-based approaches could somehow\nmimic traditional approaches (e.g., queries replacing concord-\nances or manually created lists), machine learning opens up\ncompletely new avenues of scholarship that may lead to new\nforms of human-computer interaction in the interpretation of\ntexts.\n1.6. Corpora and Fuzzy Data\nThe application of computational linguistics to the Bible implied\nthat the Bible was considered a corpus, and thus it entered the\nfield of corpus linguistics. However, in this field of studies, the\n10 See https://tiberias.dicta.org.il/, accessed 4 May 2023. 236 van Peursen\nHebrew Bible did not match the corpora from other languages\nand periods. There are huge differences between, for example,\nthe British National Corpus (BNC) and the Hebrew Bible. The\nBNC has more than 100 million words, as against 420,000 words\nin the Hebrew Bible. The BNC has extensive metadata about, for\nexample, author and date of origin, whereas for almost every part\nof the Hebrew Bible authors and provenance are debated issues.\nThe BNC has been carefully selected to create a representative\nlinguistic corpus, whereas the Hebrew Bible, whatever the selec-\ntion processes that made it the biblical canon that we now have,\nwas never intended to be linguistically representative and was\nselected along completely different criteria. Accordingly, at least\nuntil the turn of the century, the computational analysis of the\nHebrew Bible was a questionable undertaking according to the\ndeveloping standards of computational linguists. When in the\nearly 1990s Eep Talstra once presented his research on Deuteron-\nomy to an audience of computational linguists, he met with much\nmisunderstanding. How could he study a corpus of which he did\nnot know the date of origin? Unaware of the complex questions\nregarding sources and editorial processes in the Hebrew Bible\nthat have puzzled biblical scholars for centuries, one of the\nrespondents suggested that Talstra should first clean up his data\n(that is: stripping it of any later additions so that what remains is\na corpus of which the date and provenance are clear) before any\nlinguistic or textual analysis could start (Talstra 2010, 54).\nThis situation has completely changed since the above-\nmentioned emergence of Web 2.0. Currently, much linguistic\nresearch is conducted on tweets, blogposts, and other digitally Computational Linguistic Analysis 237\nborn texts that represent a kind of fuzzy data, with little context\nand little metadata, all of which resembles the Hebrew Bible\nmuch more than the BNC does. Thanks to these developments,\ncomputational research into the Bible has found a better con-\nnection with the wider field of Digital Humanities than in the last\nthree to four decades of the twentieth century.\n2.0. Key Theoretical Commitments and Major\nConcepts\n2.1. Solid Criteria instead of Subjective Intuition\nBiblical scholars were among the first who experimented using\nthe computer as a tool for the study of texts and languages. In the\n1970s, at the dawn of computer-aided textual analysis and more\nspecifically in the newly emerging field of \u2018Bible and Computer\u2019,\nthe mission of the pioneers (above, \u00a71.2.) was clear: Make mean-\ningful, substantiated statements about the Bible. Such an effort\ndid not guarantee the correct interpretation, but at least it could\nidentify interpretations that did not match the facts. Traceability\nand transparency played an important role in this development.11\n11 A typical example is Hardmeier\u2019s above-mentioned article. Addres-\nsing the question as to whether the computer can help in traditional\nsource criticsm, Hardmeier (1970, 180) argues: \u201cDie maschinelle\nKonkordanzarbeit erm\u00f6glicht dagegen ein Zweifaches: Einmal kann der\nKriterienkatalog \u00fcber die Wortschatzstatistik hinaus auf neue, rein\nformale Struktureigent\u00fcmlichkeigen bestimmter Texte ausgedehnt werden\n(\u2026) Zum anderen kan \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden, wieweit lexikalische und\nformale Merkmale f\u00fcr bestimmte Textschichten \u00fcberhaupt charak-\nteristisch sind.\u201d It was, however, only after the emergence of machine 238 van Peursen\nThis mission fit in a positivist, modernist climate, and was\nespecially opposed to an unbridled theologising based on indi-\nvidual words and etymologies, which has made, among others,\nKittel\u2019s Theologisches W\u00f6rterbuch zum Neuen Testament (1942\u2013\n1979) famous (or infamous). In the 1960s, James Barr assessed\nthis approach critically on the basis of general linguistic and\nphilological insights (see Barr 1961). Talstra, who earlier in the\n1970s had studied with Barr in Manchester, would certainly\nagree with Barr\u2019s criticism, and started creating a database that\nwas not focused on etymology and semantics, but on syntax.\nThis mission of those pioneers in Digital Humanities (at\nthat time other labels were used such as Alpha-Informatics) still\nplays an important role and is reflected in open science practices.\nStatements about occurrences of words or patterns can be made\ntraceable and reproducible, for example by publishing queries on\nthe SHEBANQ website of the ETCBC.12 At the same time, we have\nalso seen developments in computational textual analysis that\nrun counter to the ideals of the pioneers (above, \u00a71.3).\n2.2. Deep Blue and AlphaGo\nThe introduction of the computer in the workplace of the exegete\nin the last decades of the twentieth century enabled the biblical\nscholar to be more systematic, objective, and quantitative. The\nqualification \u2018objective\u2019 does not mean that computational data\nlearning that the computer was used fruitfully to address the traditional\nsource-critical questions; cf. below, \u00a73.3.\n12 See https://shebanq.ancient-data.org, accessed 4 May 2023. For the\nunderlying ideas and the role of annotation, see Roorda (2018). Computational Linguistic Analysis 239\nis theory-neutral or that the computer provides the final answer\n(as it is sometimes misunderstood), but it does indicate another\nmode of scholarship. The added value of this work lies in its\nsystematic approach, which reduces the role of intuitive ad hoc\ninterpretations, on the one hand, and in the increasing complex-\nity of searches and analyses, on the other.\nIn the 1970s\u20132000s, the claim that the computer was more\nsystematic and objective was frequently met with scepticism by\ntraditional scholars, who often found those computer guys weird\nand imagined that using the computer as a tool in biblical studies\nwas in fact building an echoing well: what you get out of the\ncomputer depends on what you put into it. Often the question\nwas raised: What does the computer deliver that could not be\ndelivered without it? To parry this criticism, I often used the\nanalogy of the chess computer, which seemed especially apt since\nDeep Blue had beaten Gary Kasparov in 1997. The mind of the\nhuman chess player works efficiently because it recognises pat-\nterns and therefore has a useful selection mechanism, whereas\nthe computer, so to speak, calculates everything (still an interest-\ning study is De Groot 1946). However, the speed with which the\ncomputer does so (which has increased over the years) is so\nimmense that it surpasses human capacities. Likewise, once you\nhave an annotated database, questions that would take months\nor years when addressed manually\u2014e.g., a statistical overview of\nplene or defective spellings, or a collection of all clause patterns\nin the Hebrew Bible where the object precedes the verb (for\nexamples, see \u00a73 below)\u2014can now be answered in very short\ntime periods. 240 van Peursen\nWhereas the analogy of the chess computer worked well\nuntil the first years of the twenty-first century, it does not capture\nthe developments that have taken place over the last two dec-\nades, described above (\u00a71.5), such as the emergence of machine\nlearning. For these developments, we can rather use the analogy\nof the Go computer (see Dorobantu 2022). Whereas the human\nworld champion of chess was defeated by the computer in 1997,\nit took until 2016 before a computer program defeated the\nhuman world champion in Go. The difference between chess and\nGo is that with Go the complexity of the game and the number\nof possible continuations is exponentially higher than with chess.\nMoreover, in Go there is also a strong aesthetic aspect. Because\nof the infinite number of possibilities and the aesthetic aspects,\ncomputational calculation power is not enough to win the game.\nRule-based approaches (enabled by calculation power) were\ninsufficient, but learning capabilities (enabled by pattern recog-\nnition) succeeded. Likewise, in textual analysis the computer is\nno longer merely a powerful calculation or sorting machine. It\nhas become a much more complex instrument, and to some\nextent less dependent on human input (above, \u00a71.5).\n2.3. The Role of Linguistic Theory in the Creation of\nText Databases\nThe different endeavours to create linguistic databases of the\nHebrew Bible reflected the different approaches that were and\nare current in biblical linguistics. Each approach has its advan-\ntages and disadvantages. And even in those cases where the\nbuilders of a database try to be as theory-neutral as possible, it Computational Linguistic Analysis 241\nwill be evident that any database and any choice that is made is\ninformed by one\u2019s position about Biblical Hebrew and about lan-\nguage in general. This is not only a challenge for computational\napproaches. It is the case in any linguistic or textual study of the\nHebrew Bible or Greek New Testament.\nLet us have a look how linguistic theory functions in the\nthree most well-known databases (above, \u00a71.1; see also Miller-\nNaud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 2018, 7), which we will discuss in the order of\ntheir age. First, the Andersen\u2013Forbes database is eclectic and\nhence somewhat ambiguous in its relation to generative gram-\nmar. Andersen and Forbes explicitly reject Chomskyan linguistics\nbut also \u201cfind much of value in the work of the generativists,\nespecially generalized phrase structure grammar\u201d (Andersen and\nForbes 2012, 14; see also Van Peursen 2015, 301). One of the\nmain reasons for their rejection of Chomskyan linguistics is their\nclaim that Biblical Hebrew belongs to the non-configurational\nlanguages, which are \u201ca serious impediment to the transforma-\ntionalists\u2019 quest for Universal Grammar\u201d (Andersen and Forbes\n2012, 87).13 Andersen was also influenced by structuralism and\nby Kenneth Pike\u2019s tagmemics (Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 2018, 7).\nInformed by syntax, function, and semantics, they developed a\nrich set of annotation labels, including, among others, seventy-\nsix part-of-speech labels.\nSecond, the ETCBC tried to be more independent of linguis-\ntic theory by following the principles of distributional analysis,\n13 For a different view on the question as to whether Biblical Hebrew is\na configurational language, partly in response to Andersen and Forbes,\nsee Kaajan (2019). 242 van Peursen\nform-to-function, and bottom-up. Unlike the Andersen\u2013Forbes\ndatabase, the ETCBC database has a rather minimal parts-of-\nspeech set (Kingham 2018). And unlike the other databases, the\nETCBC database does not immediately assign functions to forms,\nbut starts with a distributional analysis of linguistic phenomena\n(at all levels, for example varying from morphemes to clause\npatterns) before functional labels are assigned. Moreover, the\ndeduction of functions from formal criteria is transparently and\ntraceably documented in auxiliary files that are part of the data\ncreation workflow (Kingham 2018; Kingham and Van Peursen\n2018).\nThe \u2018bottom-up\u2019 description is used for approaches that\nstart from the identification of morphemes and word level analy-\nsis and move from there to the higher levels of phrases, clauses,\nsentences, and text-syntactic relations. It is often combined with\nthe form-to-function principle, which holds that we should first\nmake a distributional analysis of forms and patterns before any\nfunction can be deduced. It starts from the awareness that we\nknow little about the biblical languages and that to avoid cre-\nating an echoing well out of our own analysis or database, we\nshould start with observable textual phenomena before we pro-\nceed to function or even semantics.\n\u2018Bottom-up\u2019 is often contrasted with \u2018top-down\u2019. In Biblical\nHebrew linguistics, the latter is represented, for example, in the\ntextlinguistic approach of Robert Longacre (1989), which is\nmuch more informed by cross-linguistic evidence and applies\ncategories known from other languages (such as narrative,\npredictive, hortatory, or expository genres; techniques for, for Computational Linguistic Analysis 243\nexample, distinguishing between mainline and offline informa-\ntion or for indicating the peak of a text or discourse). Likewise,\nthe distributional analysis of forms and patterns, which to some\nextent is like Construction Grammar or exemplar-based syntax as\nit developed in the 1980s and 1990s, is often considered as a\ncounter-reaction to the generative linguistic framework.\nThird, the Holmstedt\u2013Abbegg database, also called the\nAccordance Hebrew Syntactic Database, is based on a generative\nframework (cf. Accordance documentation 2014). Whereas the\nAndersen\u2013Forbes and ETCBC databases started in the 1970s, the\nHolmstedt\u2013Abbegg database started more recently, in 2008.\nTheir intention was to create a database upon a model of Hebrew\nsyntax that differed from the two existing databases, with \u201ca tight\nfocus on syntax, grounded in (but not bound by) Chomskyan\ngenerative linguistic theory\u201d (Holmstedt and Cook 2018, 2).14\nMore specifically, they adhered to Chomskyan minimalism,\nwhich was developed in the 1990s from the Government-and-\nBinding model that was prevalent in the 1980s, but they also\nrealised that \u201cto base the database and its underlying tagging\nscheme on a fully articulated minimalist framework would be\ninappropriate.\u201d For this reason, they combined their adherence\nto Chomskyan theory with the motto \u201cdata primary, theory wise\u201d\n(Holmstedt and Cook 2018, 3).\nThat the Holmstedt\u2013Abbegg database is grounded in\nChomsky\u2019s generative approach is visible, among other things,\nin the inclusion of so-called null constituents. Because of the\n14 For other databases, which are not yet available publicly, such as\nRichter\u2019s database, see Kroeze (2013). 244 van Peursen\ngenerative principle that every phrase has a \u2018head\u2019, a null marker\nhas been inserted in every phrase that lacks an overt head. That\nHolmstedt et al. were not bound by the generative approach is\nvisible, for example, in their non-binary hierarchical clause\nanalysis, thus differing from Chomsky\u2019s minimalist syntax (as\nwell as the Government-and-Binding model), which adopts a\nstrictly binary approach to constituent structure (Holmstedt and\nCook 2018, 10).\n2.4. Back to the Black Box?\nThe emergence of author recognition techniques, neural net-\nworks, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning in recent\nyears provided new potential for biblical studies, but it also posed\nnew challenges. The results are astonishing, but exactly what the\nalgorithms do takes place in an impenetrable \u2018black box\u2019. (The\nreality of machine learning is that the computer pieces together\na set of patterns increasingly sophisticated until they fit the\nstarter data, and then these patterns are used to interpret new\ntexts. There is no known way to describe or articulate these pat-\nterns, however, which is why machine learning algorithms are\nspoken of as a \u2018black box\u2019.) This seems to be a development that\nis the reverse of the openness and traceability that the \u2018Bible and\nComputer\u2019 pioneers stood for. The attempts to make Artificial\nIntelligence understandable to humans in the field of \u2018explainable Computational Linguistic Analysis 245\nAI\u2019 (for example, in the DIANNA project [Deep Insight in Neural\nNetwork Analysis]) is still in its infancy.15\nThese transformations are perhaps even more drastic than\nthose of the 1970s. That early period from the 1970s showed, to\nsome extent, a continuation of pre-digital scholarly practices. For\nexample, it became possible to look up words with a search query\nin a digital text file instead of a paper concordance, but that did\nnot imply any methodological innovation.\nIn recent years, there have been various attempts to inte-\ngrate these new developments into biblical studies by making\nuse of advanced statistical analysis (Naaijer 2020; cf. below,\n\u00a73.2), topic modelling (Vlaardingerbroek 2017), Markov Chains\n(Kingham et al. 2018), stylometrics (Van Hecke 2018; Van Hecke\nand De Joode 2021), and neural networks (Van der Schans et al.\n2020; Naaijer 2020, 149\u201375). Here the main challenge is to\ndetermine how the results of the \u2018black box\u2019 relate to current\nscholarship.16\nA case in point are the projects in which text clustering\nmethods are applied to questions related to linguistic dating to\nsee whether we can distinguish certain groups or collections of\n15 See \u2018Deep Insight And Neural Network Analysis\u2014DIANNA\u2019,\nhttps://www.esciencecenter.nl/projects/deep-insight-and-neural-\nnetworks-analysis-dianna/, accessed 25 May 2023.\n16 Most examples in this section are taken from the ETCBC, because the\npresent author is most acquainted with it, but the situation with other\ninstitutions and with individual researchers seems to be similar. Schol-\nars recognise the great potential of recent developments in computer\nscience but are still in an experimenting phase to find out how it can be\nmade useful to biblical studies. 246 van Peursen\ntexts that agree with current scholarly notions such as Standard\nBiblical Hebrew versus Late Biblical Hebrew. The challenge is, if\nthe outcomes agree with current scholarship, the computational\nanalysis does not really add to our knowledge, except for con-\nfirming existing theories. But if the outcome seems to be at odds\nwith current scholarship, should we search for explanations that\nstill fit the traditional framework (e.g., labelling outliers in an\nalleged early corpus as later additions), or should we rather chal-\nlenge and tweak the algorithms? And if we improve the algo-\nrithms so that they better yield the expected results, how do we\navoid the risk of creating a circular argument?17\nFor all the layers of linguistic analysis that were explored\nwith rule-based approaches and distributional analysis from the\n1970s onwards, these new approaches have the potential to\naccelerate, refine, or automate analytical procedures. Although\nthere are now various databases containing a morphological\nanalysis of the Hebrew Bible, when extending the corpus to other\nHebrew texts or corpora of other Northwest-Semitic languages,\nmachine learning can be used to accelerate the process of the\nmorphological analysis.18 Likewise, with the search for phrase\npatterns, new methods searching for patterns using n-grams, flex\n17 Cf. below, \u00a73.3, for the example of the distinction between P and non-\nP by author-clustering algorithms.\n18 Thus, the eScience Center project \u2018Morphological Parser for Inflec-\ntional Languages Using Deep Learning\u2019 aims to accelerate the analytical\nprocedures by having the computer make more accurate predictions\nabout the morphological analysis based on the ETCBC\u2019s existing\nHebrew- and Syriac-encoded texts (Naaijer and Van Peursen 2022). Computational Linguistic Analysis 247\ngrams, etc. can replace the pattern-matching tools that func-\ntioned in the distributional analysis with which the ETCBC\nstarted (or the manual assignment of phrase patterns based on\nhuman intuition in other projects).19 In the text-syntactic analysis,\nautomatic anaphora resolution can complement existing methods\nof computer-assisted, text-hierarchical analysis based on clause\nrelations (cf. Erwich 2021). The identification of participants is\nthe first step to establishing their relationships as the basis for\nsocial network analysis, and other emerging approaches in which\ncomputational linguistics and literary analysis meet (cf. Canu\nH\u00f8jgaard 2021).\n2.5. From Talstra to Tiberias\nThe projects and experiments described in \u00a72.4 show a difference\nfrom the various approaches in the early years of \u2018Bible and Com-\nputer\u2019. In the projects of Andersen, Forbes, and Talstra, the lucid-\nity of the rules that were applied served as an argument for the\nvalidity of the analysis. In those new approaches, the proof for\nthe validity is not so much the structure of the algorithms or the\nanalytical steps, but rather the results of test cases.20 In, for exam-\nple, the author-clustering tools that are used for Tiberias (above,\n\u00a71.5), what counts as convincing argument for the analysis is the\n19 This happens in the CLARIAH Fellowship project \u2018PaTraCoSy:\nPAtterns in TRAnslation: Using COlibriCore for the Hebrew Bible corpus\nand its SYriac translation\u2019 (Coeckelbergs 2022).\n20 In the case of the Tiberias Stylistic Classifier (see the following\ndiscussion), at the moment of this writing the algorithms used are not\npublicly available. 248 van Peursen\nresults of a test set.21 In their case they point to the successful\ndeconstruction of an artificially mixed book, consisting of ran-\ndomly merged segments from Jeremiah and Ezekiel, coined \u2018Jer-\niel\u2019. The algorithms successfully distinguished between the two\ncomponents of this artificial book with an accuracy of 89 to 95\npercent (Dershowitz et al. 2015).\nIn conclusion, the potential of the machine learning algo-\nrithms is unprecedented, and the results are impressive. How-\never, what exactly those algorithms do, and how they arrive at\ntheir results, is beyond human understanding. The insightful and\ntraceable analyses that were the showpiece of emerging computa-\ntional Bible research (above, \u00a72.1) are now giving way to a black\nbox that, while yielding great results, allows little insight into\nwhat goes on inside that box. Even if the output of the algorithms\nprovides some insights (e.g., the Tiberias programs list the phe-\nnomena on which the results are based, such as typical linguistic\nelements of a selected corpus, which distinguish it from another\ncorpus), the human researchers will have to find out by them-\nselves the typical linguistic or stylistic features of a certain corpus\nor collection (cf. below, \u00a73.3).\n21 The term \u2018author clustering\u2019 is in this context more precise than\n\u2018author recognition\u2019; cf. Dershowitz et al. (2015, 255). Computational Linguistic Analysis 249\n3.0. Use and Contributions in Biblical Studies to\nDate\n3.1. Orthography\nAfter the emergence of databases of the Hebrew Bible, it soon\nbecame clear that computational analysis enabled types of\nresearch that were hardly imaginable without digital tools. As\nearly as the 1980s, Francis Andersen and Dean Forbes (1986)\npublished their monumental work on spelling in the Hebrew\nBible, filled with tables and mathematical formulas to investigate\nthe distribution of matres lectionis over the entire biblical corpus.\nThey could make observations about the extent to which these\nvowel letters were used in the biblical corpus, about the relation\nof the Masoretic Text to the more defective pre-exilic inscriptions\nand the more plene spellings of the last centuries BC, and about\ndifferences between the various parts of the Hebrew Bible, with\nthe Pentateuch having the most conservative spelling. More\nrecently, Johan de Joode and Dirk Speelman (2020) have applied\nquantitative linguistic methods to the orthographic heterogeneity\nwithin the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n3.2. Syntax\nWhen syntactic databases became available, all kinds of research\nquestions could be addressed more effectively, ranging from\nmajor questions about diachronic developments (Siebesma-\nMannens 2014), to the extent to which poetic structure affects\nclause patterns (Bosman 2019), to corresponding phrase and\nclause patterns in the Hebrew Bible and the Peshitta (Van 250 van Peursen\nPeursen 2007; Dyk and Van Keulen 2013), and to the interpre-\ntation of specific grammatical phenomena or translation issues.\nIt is now easy to find parallels for the construction in the phrase\n\u05d0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d4\u05d4\u05b7 \u05dd\u05d5\u05d9\u05b9\u05bc\u05d1\u05b7 \u05dd\u05e2\u05b7\u05e0\u05b9 \u05d9\u05d1\u05b9\u05b4\u05d0\u05b2 \u05be\u05df\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc \u05e7\u05e8\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b9\u05b8\u05bc \u05d5\u05bc \u05d4\u05e8\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5\u05d1\u05b9\u05d3\u05b0\u05bc \u05e8\u05e9\u05b7 \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc \u05d5\u05b7 \u2018On that day Deborah and\nBarak son of Abinoam sang (f. sg.)\u2019 (Judg. 5.1), where the verb\npreceding the compound subject agrees with the first element of\nthis subject. Those parallels show that this is a common phe-\nnomenon and that an emendation of the verb or the deletion of\nthe second part of the subject (\u2018and Barak\u2026\u2019) is not needed\n(Sandborg-Petersen 2011; Meeuse 2021, 10). Likewise, a careful\nanalysis of the verb valence pattern used shows that the phrase\n\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0 \u05df\u05d9\u05b4\u05e7\u05b7 \u05dc\u05b0\u05bc \u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05a4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05d9\u05b0\u05bc \u05dd\u05e9\u05b6\u05bc \u05d9\u05b9\u05bc\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5\u05b7 (Gen. 4.15) should be translated \u2018And the LORD\nset a sign in place on behalf of Cain\u2019 rather than with \u2018And the\nLORD put a mark on Cain\u2019, which is the rendering of the NRSV\nand many other translations (Dyk, Glanz, and Oosting 2013, 30\u2013\n32; Meeuse 2021, 6\u20137).\nThe more advanced applications of statistical analysis and\nmachine learning enable new possibilities for charting the dis-\ntribution of clause patterns over the Hebrew Bible in relation to\nvarious parameters, such as assumed date of origin, genre, text\ntype, and sentence pattern. An interesting case concerns the dis-\ntribution of \u2018to be\u2019 constructions. In Biblical Hebrew, there are\nfive ways in which \u2018to be\u2019 can be expressed: Bipartite and tripar-\ntite nominal clauses; constructions with the particles \u05e9\u05d9\u05b5 (\u2018there\nis\u2019) and \u05df\u05d9\u05d0\u05b5 (\u2018there is not\u2019); and clauses containing the verb \u05d4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05b8\u05bc (\u2018to\nbe\u2019). On the basis of quantitative analysis taking all these parame-\nters into account, Martijn Naaijer (2020) has convincingly argued\nthat in the alleged Early Biblical Hebrew corpus the so-called Computational Linguistic Analysis 251\nnarrative text type and the direct speech sections differ consid-\nerably, and that the direct speech sections show similarities with\nthe Late Biblical Hebrew texts (regardless of the distinction\nbetween narrative and direct speech in the latter). In other\nwords: in late texts, there is less of a difference between narrative\nand direct speech.\n3.3. Author Clustering\nPerhaps the most cutting-edge application of machine learning\nand computational linguistics to biblical studies can be found at\nthe research group at Bar Ilan University that is responsible for\nthe Tiberias Stylistic Classifier for the Hebrew Bible (above,\n\u00a7\u00a71.5., 2.4., and 2.5.). Their tools distinguished between Priestly\n(P) and non-Priestly (non-P) texts in the Pentateuch, thus agree-\ning with a major conclusion of the Documentary Hypothesis\n(Dershowitz et al. 2015).22 This is not only a milestone in the\napplication of computational linguistics in biblical studies. It also\nshows where the interaction between computational linguistics\nand biblical scholarship can now take place, because the outcome\nof the computational analysis is not merely an \u2018objective proof\u2019\nof a scholarly hypothesis, but rather the start of new scholarly\nreflection as articulated and tested with the iterative develop-\nment and application of computer algorithms. Questions that\narise are: How can we account for the few verses that have been\nclassified as non-P in traditional scholarship, but were assigned\n22 Another interesting case study is the assignment of Isaiah 34\u201335, for\nwhich it has been argued that these chapters were written by Deutero-\nIsaiah (Berman 2021). 252 van Peursen\nP in the computational analysis and vice versa? Do they reveal\nflaws in the algorithms, or should we rather reconsider their\nassignment to P or non-P? (For this dilemma see also above,\n\u00a72.4.) What does the outcome tell about the other elements of\nthe Documentary Hypothesis, such as the J, E, and D sources, that\ncannot be distinguished by the algorithms?23 Would scholars ever\nhave set out to answer such a question with computational lin-\nguistics if the hypothesis had not already existed? The algo-\nrithm\u2019s ability to distinguish between P and non-P means they\nconsistently differ, but what confidence do we have that they\ndiffer in the way scholars have claimed they do (e.g. in terms of\nauthorship and date)?\nAnother question relates to the notion of author recognition\nand computer programs that are built to detect unconscious indi-\nvidual elements of language use and an author\u2019s \u201csubtle stylistic\npreferences\u201d (Dershowitz et al. 2015, 253). How can such an\napproach be applied to compositions such as P that in Old Testa-\nment scholarship are usually considered the work of groups of\nscribes, or as consisting of successive editorial layers?24 The algo-\nrithms will not reproduce S. R. Driver\u2019s (1913, 131\u201335) list of\nwords and phrases typical of P, and the notion of an author as an\nindividual that can be identified on the basis of unconscious\n23 Cf. Dershowitz et al. (2015, 270): \u201cThere appear to be two possible\nexplanations for this: (1) the J and E source are not sufficiently distinct\nfrom one another in terms of word usage (\u2026); (2) the traditional J/E\ndivision is flawed.\u201d\n24 See, e.g., Smend (1978, 57), on the supposed successive stages of the\ncomposition of P. Computational Linguistic Analysis 253\nauthorial fingerprints seems to be remote from the priestly circles\nlike the alleged Sitz im Leben of P in traditional Old Testament\nscholarship. Yet, traditional source criticism and cutting-edge\nauthor-clustering algorithms largely arrive at a similar distinc-\ntion between P and non-P. Here is both the requirement and\nopportunity to reconcile the claims of what has been called\n\u2018algorithmic criticism\u2019 (Verhaar 2016) with those of traditional\nscholarship. Or in other words, to proceed from Humanities 1.0\n(traditional source criticism) through Humanities 2.0 (source\ndetection with author-clustering algorithms) to Humanities 3.0\n(cf. above, \u00a71.4).\n4.0. Prospects for Further Study, Application, and\nCollaboration\n4.1. Syntax and Semantics\nMost of the database projects that began in the 1970s and the\n1980s started with syntax. The Andersen\u2013Forbes database also\nincludes semantic roles, but the way in which the labels have\nbeen assigned is not always clear and hence they are difficult to\nreproduce (and therefore assess). The other databases currently\navailable also have a strong focus on syntax. This focus is under-\nstandable from the positivist climate in which these projects orig-\ninated and the uneasiness that was felt with contemporaneous\netymologising lexicographical approaches. But now, about half a\ncentury later, it is crucial to investigate how computational lin-\nguistics can be applied to the semantics of Biblical Hebrew. Oth-\nerwise, what happens is that advanced syntactic databases are 254 van Peursen\nenriched with digital representatives of the scholarly knowledge\nof the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as it is codified, for\nexample, in Brown, Driver, and Briggs\u2019s 1910 lexicon. This is\nwhat we see happen in the commercial or semi-commercial Bible\nsoftware packages in which both the advanced syntactic data-\nbases discussed in this chapter and the older lexicographical\nresources have become available.\nThere are two clear ways in which the current syntactic\ndatabases could be extended towards semantic analysis. The first\nrelates to the intersection of syntax and semantics. The search for\nvalence patterns provides new insights about the meaning and\nusage of a verb. Hence one way to proceed is to enrich the syn-\ntactic labels with verbal valence patterns and the associated\nsemantic roles according to strict criteria of how valence patterns\nand meaning interrelate (cf. Dyk 2016). For the study of verbal\nvalence and clause patterns, the application of existing approach-\nes, especially those that have been applied successfully in compu-\ntational linguistics such as Role and Reference Grammar, appears\nto be promising (cf. Canu H\u00f8jgaard 2019).\nAnother way in which the current database could be\nextended to semantic analysis is the application of methods that\nhave been developed in computational lexicography and seman-\ntics to the Hebrew Bible. Obviously, not everything that has been\ndeveloped in this field is applicable to the Bible, which is, lin-\nguistically speaking, a limited corpus without native speakers.\nThus, building a WordNet for Biblical Hebrew would meet with\nmany complications. What could be promising, however, is to\nexperiment with approaches such as co-occurrence analysis, Computational Linguistic Analysis 255\ntopic modelling, and similar methods to establish the relations\nbetween words.25\n4.2. Linked Data and Geospatial Analysis\nAn extension of semantic and lexicographic information may be\nthe interlinking with other resources. In recent years, the ETCBC\nhas explored the potential use of Linked Data in which textual\ndata is linked to encyclopedic or geospatial data. Pilot projects\ninclude Linking Syriac Data (2017\u20132018);26 Linking Syriac Litur-\ngies (Van Peursen and Veldman 2018); and Linking Syriac Geo-\ngraphic Data (see Van Peursen 2018). Although it is wonderful\nthat this brings the textual data (in these projects: Syriac data)\ninto the Linked Data universe, there is the danger that encyclo-\npedic information takes the place of sound syntactic analysis. If,\nfor example, we want to map all the geographical entities men-\ntioned in the Syriac Book of the Laws of the Countries, we have\nto decide how to identify the places mentioned or to locate the\npeoples mentioned in those texts. The same can be said of the\nfamous catalogue of nations and peoples gathered at Jerusalem\nin Acts 2:9\u201311 (Van Altena 2022, 135\u201357). Such questions may\n25 Such new initiatives could be linked with or even incorporated in the\nmost up-to-date digitally-available lexicographical and semantic resources,\nsuch as those of the Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew (https://\nsemanticdictionary.org, accessed 4 May 2023) and the Semantics of\nAncient Hebrew Database (https://www.sahd.div.ed.ac.uk, accessed 4\nMay 2023) projects.\n26 See https://github.com/hvlaardingerbroek/LinkSyr, accessed 4 May\n2023. 256 van Peursen\nbe even more challenging in the case of biblical studies, because\nof the debate over the extent to which the biblical accounts can\nbe related to the history and geography of ancient Israel and\ngiven the uncertainties about the identification of places and\nevents in the Bible.\nIn addition to these interpretive difficulties, there is the\nchallenge that we mentioned in \u00a71.3 above. If linked geospatial\ndata do not go beyond a mere digital representation of the\nwell-known traditional atlases of the Bible, or of the maps of\nJerusalem, ancient Israel, the ancient Near East, and the Roman\nEmpire often included in printed Bibles, this only serves practical\npurposes, rather than representing a methodological innovation.\nHowever, given the \u2018spatial turn\u2019 in biblical studies (cf. Van\nAltena 2022, 41), it is to be expected that geospatial analysis,\nwhen applied properly, can lead to new insights and a better\nunderstanding of the Bible, even though its application to the\nBible is still in its infancy.\n4.3. Collaboration and Open Science\nAnother field where progress can be made is the comparison of\nthe various linguistic databases of the Hebrew Bible. Each data-\nbase has its specific approach, and the user is most helped by\nbeing able to compare the various databases, their underlying\nassumptions, and the way in which these assumptions resulted in\nthe annotations in each verse of the Bible.27 It is a pity, however,\nthat anyone who wants to compare the three most elaborate\n27 A nice comparison is made in Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2018). Computational Linguistic Analysis 257\ndatabases available to date (cf. \u00a7\u00a71.1 and 2.3) needs to purchase\nthem in commercial software packages. Only the ETCBC database\nand the Westminster Hebrew Syntax Without Morphology (cf.\nn. 6 above) are publicly available. Bringing the other databases\ninto the open access domain is easier said than done, given copy-\nright issues and business models, as well as practical challenges,\nbut hopefully these challenges can be resolved in the near future.\nThis will be necessary to enable scholarly pursuits engaging with\nall the databases.\nOpen Science, however, is more than making databases\navailable. It relates also to the transparency of analytical proce-\ndures and the availability of queries and algorithms. A break-\nthrough in the application of computational linguistic analysis to\nthe Hebrew Bible would be the availability of the workflows of\nthe data creation processes and the programs that have been used\nin the creation of those databases and of the algorithms that are\ncurrently being developed for advanced cutting-edge approaches\nas those mentioned in \u00a7\u00a72.4. and 3.3.\n4.4. Computational Linguistics and the New\nTestament\nThis chapter focused on the use of computational linguistics in\nOld Testament studies. In New Testament studies we see parallel\ndevelopments, although syntactic databases emerged somewhat\nlater than in Old Testament studies.28\n28 For the pioneering work in the 1970s and 1980s see Mealand (1988).\nHowever, in the first decades of the emerging field of \u2018Bible and\nComputer\u2019 relatively more attention was paid to the Old Testament and 258 van Peursen\nThe morphological encoding started, as in the case of the\nOld Testament, in the 1970s, with, e.g., the GRAMCORD Greek\nNew Testament (first published 1977); the work of Timothy and\nBarbara Friberg, who produced the Analytical Greek New Testa-\nment (first published 1981); and MorphGNT, which was initiated\nin the 1980s by Robert Kraft at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s\nCenter for Computer Analysis of Texts (CCAT) and received\nmajor updates and corrections by James Tauber from the 1990s\nonwards.29\nThe computational syntactic analysis of the New Testament\nreceived an impetus from two projects that started in the first\nyears of the twenty-first century.30 The first project is the Greek\nHebrew than to the New Testament and Greek. This is reflected, for\nexample, in the contributions to the AIBI conferences (cf. above, \u00a71.2).\nThe contributions to the first AIBI conference (Leuven, 1985) included\ntwelve contributions that dealt exclusively with Hebrew and the Old\nTestament and only four that dealt with Greek and the New Testament\n(besides eight other contributions). The second conference (Jerusalem,\n1988) showed similar statistics. It contained seventeen contributions on\nHebrew and the Old Testament, two on the Septuagint, two on Greek\nand the New Testament and one on the Greek works of Gregorius of\nNyssa (besides thirteen other on general issues or discussing both the\nOld and the New Testament).\n29 Available on GitHub: https://github.com/morphgnt, accessed 4 May\n2023.\n30 Because of copyright issues, these open-source projects are often\nbased on the older editions by Nestle, Tischendorf and Westscott, and\nHort, or on the SBL Greek New Testament, rather than on the most\nrecent Nestle-Aland edition. For a morphologically annotated version of Computational Linguistic Analysis 259\nNew Testament of the OpenText.org initiative by Stanley E. Porter\nat McMaster Divinity College and partners. The goal of this pro-\nject is, according to its website, \u201cto construct a representative\ncorpus of Hellenistic Greek (including the entire New Testament\nand selected Hellenistic writings of the same period) to facilitate\nlinguistic and literary research of the New Testament docu-\nments.\u201d At clause level their annotations include four major\ncategories: Subject, Predicator, Complement, and Adjunct.\nSome more syntactic categories (e.g., object, second object)\nare distinguished in a project of the Asia Bible Society, namely\nthe Greek syntax trees produced by Andi Wu and Randall K. Tan\n(who was also involved in the OpenText.org project) and made\navailable through Clear Bible (formerly Global Bible Initiative).31\nThese data interact well with other tools such as the Lowfat\nSyntax Tree Browser.32\nthe Byzantine Text see https://github.com/byztxt, accessed 4 May\n2023.\n31 Greek syntax trees: https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-\nnew-testament/tree/master/syntax-trees, accessed 4 May 2023; Clear\nBible: https://www.clear.bible, accessed 4 May 2023.\n32 See https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament/\ntree/master/syntax-trees/reader/doc, accessed 4 May 2023.

The computer program Collate, developed by Peter\nRobinson in the late 1980s (succeeded in 2010 by Collatex34) was\nsoon adopted by New Testament scholarship in Birmingham and\nM\u00fcnster for text comparison and text editing. In the early 1990s,\nGerd Mink, one of the editors of the Editio Critica Maior (ECM) of\nthe Greek New Testament, developed the Coherence-Based Gene-\nalogical Method (CBGM; Wachtel 2019). This method was partic-\nularly apt to deal with the typical features of the transmission of\nthe New Testament, such as the high degree of contamination,\nwhich hinders the traditional genealogical tree-model (Gurry\n2016).\nNew Testament scholarship has also made great progress in\nmanuscript imaging (see various contributions in Hamidovi\u0107 et\nal. 2019). Hundreds of manuscripts have been digitised and high-\nquality images can be studied and annotated in the Virtual Manu-\nscript Room of the Institut f\u00fcr Neutestamentliche Textforschung\n33 See https://github.com/CenterBLC/NA, accessed 4 May 2023.\n34 See https://collatex.net/about, accessed 4 May 2023. Computational Linguistic Analysis 261\n(INTF) in M\u00fcnster.35 And as in the case of Old Testament studies,\nnew experiments with data meaning, text reuse detection, and\nthe use of NLP for semantic information extraction have appeared\non the scene (for examples see Hamidovi\u0107 et al. 2019).36\n5.0. Further Reading\nThe various databases discussed in this chapter do not provide\nfinal answers, but are useful tools, each of them situated in the\ncomplex field of linguistic theories. It is therefore extremely\nimportant to use them in consultation with the documentation\nlisted below.\nThose who want to do more advanced analysis are advised\nto develop some basic programming skills and use the datasets\nthat are available as a whole on GitHub or another platform,\nrather than only with a user-friendly search interface.\nIn the case of the ETCBC database, for example, Meeuse\n(2021) is a good starting point for exploring the database through\nthe user interface of the SHEBANQ website, but much more\nadvanced research (as in the examples mentioned in \u00a73.2) is\npossible for those who have mastered Python and use the Python\npackage Text-Fabric to analyse the Hebrew Bible.37\n35 See https://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de, accessed 4 May 2023.\n36 See also above, \u00a74.2 on geospatial analysis in New Testament studies.\n37 SHEBANQ website: https://shebanq.ancient-data.org; ETCBC data-\nbase on GitHub: https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa; Text-Fabric: https://\ngithub.com/annotation/text-fabric; Python courses: https://www.\ncodecademy.com or https://www.udemy.com/user/fredbaptiste.

EMERGING FROM SILOS OF ANALYSIS: A\nCOMPLEXITY THEORY APPROACH TO\nTHE STUDY OF BIBLICAL TEXTS\nSophia L. Pitcher\nLanguage is a complex system (Larsen-Freeman 1997; Larsen-\nFreeman and Cameron 2008; Ellis and Larsen-Freeman 2009a).\nTogether, the many dimensions of language comprise an intricate\nnexus of heterogenous components that often interact in sur-\nprising ways. Some of the dimensions of language\u2014grammar,\northography and the written transmission of texts, language\nacquisition, and language variation\u2014comprise complex systems\nin themselves. For example, language acquisition, or more pre-\ncisely an individual\u2019s developing proficiency in a language (see\nLarsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 157; D\u00f6rnyei 2009; Ellis and\nLarsen-Freeman 2009b; Naud\u00e9 2012, 64), involves dynamic\ninteractions between multiple agents. Speech communities, in\nconstant flux, are comprised of individuals at various levels of\nproficiency who exhibit varying patterns of language use (see\nMufwene 2008, 3; Beckner et al. 2009, 12\u201315; Naud\u00e9 2012, 67\u2013\n68, 69). Language variation is similarly complex, as it encom-\npasses variation manifested synchronically and diachronically.\nSynchronic language variation happens in real time at the level\nof individual speakers (viz. idiolects) and communities of\n\u00a9 2023 Sophia L. Pitcher, CC BY-NC 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358.06 274 Pitcher\nspeakers (viz. dialects; see Mufwene 2008, 15\u201328; Beckner et al.\n2009, 7, 9, 12\u201315; Blythe and Croft 2009, 48; Naud\u00e9 2012, 67\u2013\n68), while diachronic language variation involves the interplay\nbetween culturally transmitted linguistic structures that \u201cpersist\nfor millennia\u201d (Naud\u00e9 2012, 73) and those that do not, resulting\nin the \u201crenovation of morphosyntactic structure\u201d (Giv\u00f3n 2009,\n43; Naud\u00e9 2012, 73) over time (see also Beckner and Bybee\n2009).\nHigher-level dimensions of language can be reduced to\nreveal complex components at lower levels of organisation. For\nexample, the components of the grammar of a language include\nsyntax, morphology, phonology, semantics, and discourse-\npragmatics. These components interface at various levels and to\nvarying degrees, forming dynamic and often nonlinear phenom-\nena. For example, the phonological dimension not only includes\na language\u2019s sound system as represented by its consonants,\nvowels, and lexical tones (if present) but also prosodic phonol-\nogy, with its own array of constituent features that interact with\nmorphological, syntactic, semantic, and discourse-pragmatic\ndomains.\nConceptualised as a complex system, language consists of\nmulti-dimensional layers that are distinct but nonetheless inter-\nrelated\u2014each layer influencing the other, while simultaneously\nshaping the system as a continuously evolving whole. This hier-\narchical interconnectedness characterises the nature of complex\nsystems. As Baicchi (2015, 10) describes, complex systems are\n\u201cheterogeneous entities that, interacting with each other and\nwith their environment, generate multiple layers of collective Complexity Theory 275\nstructure exhibiting hierarchical self-organization without cen-\ntralized control.\u201d Characterising language in such a way encour-\nages analyses that are also multi-dimensional and that seek to\naccount for linguistic phenomena as they exist within the system.\nAlthough a complex systems approach may threaten analysis\nwith a bewildering degree of variability, it offers two clear and\ncompelling benefits: (1) an awareness of the empirical nature of\nthe object of study, which includes the presence of other phenom-\nena that share its nexus, and (2) theoretical grounding that aims\nto provide greater analytical integration of seemingly disparate\nfactors operating within the system.\nIn other words, a complex-systems approach to language\nrecognises that isolated analyses artificially simplify and often\nobscure the object of study (see Larsen-Freeman 1997; Larsen-\nFreeman and Cameron 2008, 9; Schwartzhaupt 2013, 262). Per-\nhaps more fundamentally, it \u201coffers greater coherence in explain-\ning what [is] already know[n]\u201d (Larsen-Freeman and Cameron\n2008, 11). It is for these reasons that a complexity approach to\nlanguage is beginning to influence the way language phenomena\nare understood within certain subfields of linguistics. This sys-\ntems view is also beginning to impact the way biblical scholars\nanalyse, teach, and translate biblical texts.\nTo introduce the merits of a complexity approach to the\nstudy of biblical texts, this paper will discuss the origins of Com-\nplexity Theory (CT) and its historical development within the\nfield of linguistics (\u00a71), the seven core attributes of complex sys-\ntems (\u00a72), and the ways in which a complexity approach has been\nfruitfully applied to biblical scholarship (\u00a73). 276 Pitcher\n1.0. Complexity Theory: Origins and Historical\nDevelopment\nBaicchi (2015, 10) identifies the ancient Greek philosopher\nHeraclitus (ca 500 BCE) as articulating the earliest philosophical\nexpressions on the dynamism and unity of natural phenomena\n(see also Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 6). Heraclitus\ndescribed the material world as interconnected and in continuous\nflux. This perspective challenged a static philosophy of the mate-\nrial world, \u201cwhich described reality as if it were composed of\nstatic individuals and the state of being as conceptually \u2018simple\u2019,\ninternally unchangeable and undifferentiated\u201d (Baicchi 2015,\n10). Baicchi (2015, 10) also cites the \u2018process philosophy\u2019 of\nAlfred Whitehead as advancing Heraclitus\u2019 notion of dynamicity\nand originating \u2018systems thinking\u2019 in the early twentieth century.\nIn his essay Process and Reality, Whitehead (1929) argues for a\nphilosophical balance between \u201cthe metaphysics of substance\u2026\nand the metaphysics of flux\u201d (1929, 209). Whitehead does this\nby postulating that a \u201cparticular existent\u201d or entity is character-\nised by the notion of concrescence\u2014a \u201cfluency inherent in [its]\nconstitution\u201d (1929, 210). He argues that \u201cthe real internal\nconstitution of a particular existent\u201d (1929, 210) is an intercon-\nnected, dynamic process of a larger whole (1929, 211, 214\u2013215):\n\u2018Concrescence\u2019 is the name for the process in which the\nuniverse of many things acquires an individual unity in a\ndeterminate relegation of each item of the \u2018many\u2019 to its\nsubordination in the constitution of the novel \u2018one\u2019. The\nmost general term \u2018thing\u2019\u2014or, equivalently, \u2018entity\u2019\u2014\nmeans nothing else than to be one of the \u2018many\u2019 which find\ntheir niches in each instance of concrescence. Each Complexity Theory 277\ninstance of concrescence is itself the novel individual\n\u2018thing\u2019 in question.\u2026 The notion of \u2018organism\u2019 is combined\nwith that of \u2018process\u2019 in a twofold manner. The community\nof actual things is an organism; but it is not a static organ-\nism. It is an incompletion in process of production.\u2026 In\nthis sense, an organism is a nexus. Secondly, each actual\nentity is itself only describable as an organic process. It\nrepeats in microcosm what the universe is in macrocosm.\nIt is a process proceeding from phase to phase, each phase\nbeing the real basis from which its successor proceeds\ntowards the completion of the thing in question. Each\nactual entity bears in its constitution the \u2018reasons\u2019 why its\nconditions are what they are. These \u2018reasons\u2019 are the other\nactual entities objectified for it.\u2026 Thus each actual entity,\nalthough complete so far as concerns its microscopic pro-\ncess, is yet incomplete by reason of its objective inclusion\nof the macroscopic process.\nWhitehead understands an individual category or entity to be the\nperception of a process at a particular moment in time. Further-\nmore, he concludes that an individual entity or occasion may be\nanalysed, but the analysis is by nature transitory.\nWhile these philosophical antecedents of complexity are\nnoteworthy, Larsen-Freeman and Cameron (2008, 2\u20133) credit\nmid-twentieth century scientists with formulating the most influ-\nential precursors of CT. They cite Conrad Waddington\u2019s descrip-\ntion of embryogenesis in 1940 as a pivotal systems description.\nWithin this conceptual framework, an embryo is not fully deter-\nmined by genetic information, but rather (Larsen-Freeman and\nCameron 2008, 2):\neach step in the process of development creates the condi-\ntions for the next one. In other words, \u201cthe form of the 278 Pitcher\nbody is literally constructed by the construction process\nitself\u2014and is not specified in some pre-existing full instruc-\ntion set, design or building plan\u2026\u201d (van Geert 2003, 648\u2013\n649).\nIn a similar vein, in 1950, biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy pro-\nposed a general systems theory that described \u201can entity as the\nsum of the properties of its parts\u201d (Larsen-Freeman and Cameron\n2008, 2). In doing so, he eschewed reducing an entity to any one\nof its parts, underscoring the importance of the \u201crelationships\namong the parts which connect them to the whole\u201d (Larsen-\nFreeman and Cameron 2008, 3).\nOver the next three decades, scientists continued to develop\na systems approach to natural phenomena (see Larsen-Freeman\nand Cameron 2008, 3\u20134).1 In the 1980s, this field of research\nculminated in the founding of the Santa Fe Institute. The institute\nquickly became the hub for exploring the nature of complex\nadaptive systems, where CT was formalised and multidisciplinary\nresearch flourished (Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 3). The\napplication of CT has been extended to such diverse fields (see\nLarsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 3\u20137; see also Pearce and\nMerletti 2006) as business management (Battram 1998), physics\n(Gell-Mann 1994), epidemiology (Pearce and Merletti 2006),\npsychology (Spivey 2007), economics (Arthur 2013), and trans-\nlation and development studies (Marais, 2014).\n1 Marais (2014, 19) also cites chaos theory as an influential precursor\nto the development of CT. Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics that\nexplores the underlying order of systems that exhibit random states of\ndisorder and irregular patterns (e.g., the weather as demonstrated by\nthe butterfly effect [Gleick 1987, 9\u201331; Dooley 2009]). Complexity Theory 279\nAt the close of the century, Larsen-Freeman pioneered a\ncomplexity approach to applied linguistics, exploring the merits\nof a complexity model for language acquisition and second lan-\nguage instruction. Her primary hope for developing complexity\nthinking within her field was that \u201cthe dynamics of complex\nnonlinear systems [would] discourage reductionist explanations\u201d\n(Larsen-Freeman 1997, 142). For Larsen-Freeman, much of the\ntheoretical appeal of CT lies in the dynamic and holistic meta-\nphor that it engenders, enabling researchers to perceive funda-\nmental properties and interactions of language phenomena that\nremain opaque to traditional theoretical frameworks. She argues\nthat the insights that emerge from a complexity approach are not\nequally accessible to these frameworks because at their core they\nreduce or isolate the object of study, and in doing so obscure it.\nAccording to Larsen-Freeman and Cameron (2008, 6), lin-\nguists have typically taken a binary approach to the description\nof language phenomena, as either an inner perspective of the\nmind (see Chomsky 1965), or an outer perspective of the world\n(see Weinreich et al. 1968). Linguists who take the inner per-\nspective typically investigate \u201cmental competence rather than\nperformance\u201d (2008, 6), while those who have taken the outer\nperspective often seek to create \u201ca model of language which\naccommodates the facts of variable usage\u201d (2008, 6). Larsen-\nFreeman and Cameron (2008, 6) assess the deficiencies of these\npolar approaches to language theory in the following way:\nApplied linguists have\u2026 preferr[ed] to explain the facts of\nlanguage\u2026 either through an appeal to a mental compe-\ntence\u2026 or by taking language use factors into account,\nshowing patterns in variability.\u2026 But mental competence, 280 Pitcher\nwhen it is seen to be \u201cirreducibly self-contained, cannot\nmeaningfully relate to the world outside\u201d (Leather and van\nDam 2003, 6)\u2014which applied linguists must do\u2014and the\nhybridity of more socially-oriented approaches have\ntended to treat the world (context) as an independent\nvariable that influences linguistic form, not as a dynamic\nsystem itself. Here, perhaps, Complexity Theory may\ncontribute to a resolution.\nA complexity approach to language resolves the tension of this\ndichotomy by rejecting the view that the environment is \u201cexter-\nnal to and independent from the organism\u201d (Larsen-Freeman and\nCameron 2008, 7) and advancing the view that the dimensions\nof language \u201cemerge from interrelated patterns of experience,\nsocial interaction, and cognitive mechanisms\u201d (Beckner et al.\n2009, 2).\nPerhaps most fundamentally, Larsen-Freeman (2013, 370)\nunderstands CT to be a metatheory \u201cstill necessitating object\ntheories\u201d (viz. discipline theories). According to Larsen-Freeman,\nit is precisely this characteristic that endows CT with one of its\ngreatest advantages\u2014transdisciplinarity: CT \u201cavoids the splin-\ntering of disciplinary knowledge and creates instead new forms\nof knowledge, which are thematic, cutting across disciplinary\nboundaries\u201d (2013, 370). In fact, Marais (2014, 18) considers the\ntrajectory of Western scholarship towards interdisciplinarity and\ncomplexity frameworks to be inevitable:\nIn a sense, complexity thinking seems to be inevitable. The\nwhole program of Western science has focused on ana-\nlyzing the parts of reality in order to understand them\nbetter\u2026. Now, the realization is dawning on scholars that\nanalysis can only take you so far, because only a small part Complexity Theory 281\nof reality is to be explained by the way parts are, or only a\nsmall part of reality can be understood by understanding\nthe parts of it. Much of reality is to be explained not by the\nparts themselves but by the way in which they relate to\none another or by the way in which they are becoming, the\nway in which constituent parts form wholes\u2026 The focus\nhas thus shifted from an analysis of parts to a focus on the\nrelationships and connections between parts and between\nparts and wholes. Also, the focus has shifted from an inter-\nest in phenomena to an interest in processes, that is, the\nway in which phenomena are the result of the interaction\nof their constituent parts.\nMarais is also quick to point out that while the notions of\nmovement, process, and interdisciplinary synthesis factor into\nthe descriptions of complex systems, they are not of primary\nimportance. For Marais (2014, 18), stasis, being, and disciplinary\nanalysis are equally important notions since they too characterise\nreality:\nThe philosophical problems of stasis and movement, and\nof how both constitute reality, are within the purview of\ncomplexity thinking. Let me hurry to say that I do not sug-\ngest replacing analysis with synthesis or being with pro-\ncess. I hope to incorporate these binaries in a complexity\nview in which both sides of the binary find their rightful\nplace in thinking about a particular phenomenon.\n2.0. Seven Core Characteristics of Complex\nSystems\nCT is chiefly concerned with the description and modelling of the\nrelationships between the components of complex systems\u2014par-\nticularly, the relationships that emerge from changing and often 282 Pitcher\nunexpected interactions among the components. According to\nLarsen-Freeman and Cameron (2008), seven core attributes char-\nacterise complex systems: 1) dynamism, 2) heterogeneity, 3) open-\nness, 4) interconnectedness, 5) emergence, 6) nonlinearity, and\n7) adaptation.\nFirst, complex systems are dynamic. The dynamism of a\ncomplex system refers to its non-static nature; it is a system in\nconstant flux (Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 29\u201330). In\nfact, Larsen-Freeman and Cameron assert that dynamism is likely\nthe defining feature of language as a complex system (2008, 25)\nbecause \u201clanguage, language use, and language development are\ncontinuously in action\u201d (2008, 29).\nSecond, unlike simple systems (e.g., a traffic light; see\nLarsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 27) that are comprised of \u201ca\nsmall set of similar components\u2026 connected in predictable and\nunchanging ways\u201d (2008, 27), complex systems embody a multi-\nplicity of dynamic, heterogeneous components.\nThird, complex systems are open. Unlike closed systems,\nthose that are open allow energy, matter, or other influences to\nenter from the outside (Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 32).\nFor example, a closed highway system would be one with a fixed\nnumber of vehicles and a fixed road capacity. However, in an\nopen road system (2008, 31) where traffic continually increases\nbut road capacity remains static, the roads will eventually \u201creach\nequilibrium in the form of gridlock\u201d (2008, 32). Such a result\ninitiates pressure to add road capacity, thereby influencing the\ncontext of the system. So, in an open highway system, free-\nflowing equilibrium can only be maintained by introducing Complexity Theory 283\nadditional road capacity to the system. This means that open\nsystems \u201cnot only adapt to their contexts but also initiate change\nin those contexts; these systems are not just dependent on context\nbut also influence context\u201d (Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008,\n34).\nA linguistic example of this attribute is provided in the\nlexicon\u2014a subsystem of language that exhibits varying degrees\nof openness. Certain classes of words in the lexicon are more open\nthan others; the addition or attrition of nouns, for example, is\ngreater than that of prepositions. Furthermore, as an open sys-\ntem, the lexicon can undergo transformation generated by the\ninteraction of lexical inputs and other dimensions of language.\nFor example, the loss of case in Biblical Hebrew (see Waltke and\nO\u2019Connor 1990, \u00a78.1.c), a morphological change, initiated a pho-\nnological process that changed the vowel structure of segolate\nnouns. Specifically, the loss of the vocalic case marker resulted\nin a consonant cluster, triggering an epenthetic vowel, which\nthen effected vowel harmony in the first syllable (e.g. *malk >\nmalek > melek \u2018king\u2019; see Blau 2010, 54).\nThis leads to the fourth attribute of complex systems\u2014\ninterconnectedness. Complex systems exhibit interconnectedness\nbetween their numerous components, dimensions, and contex-\ntual factors. A linguistic example of this attribute is illustrated in\nthe morphophonemics of the Biblical Hebrew conjunction waw.\nAs is well known, the coordinating waw morpheme has multiple\nallophones depending on its phonological context. However,\nRevell (2015, 43; 2016, 75\u201376) and Scheumann (2020, 58\u201359)\nobserve that the proclitic allophones of waw are also determined 284 Pitcher\nby their prosodic contexts\u2014particularly, the position of waw\nwithin a phrase segmented by a disjunctive t\u0323a\u02bfam.\nConjunction waw takes a [qames\u0323] before the second con-\njunct of each pair that has an initial accent [viz. an accent\non the first syllable] [\u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u0594\u05d5\u05b8 \u05d4\u05dc\u05b8\u05d9\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05a3 1 Kgs 8. 29].\u2026 Conversely,\nwhen a waw is attached to the first conjunct in each pair,\nit takes a schwa, even though these conjuncts also have an\ninitial accent [ \u05d4\u05dc\u05b8 \u05d9\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u0596 \u05d5\u05b8 \u05dd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05a5\u05d5\u05b0 Gen. 8.22].\u2026 The phonetics of the\naccented syllable do not play a decisive role for this vocal-\nisation of waw.\u2026 The vocalic change cannot be explained\nby phonetic assimilation or dissimilation rules. Rather, the\ndistribution of the allophone \u05d5\u05b8 is determined by prosody\n(Scheumann 2020, 58\u201359).\nMoreover, scholars have proposed additional factors (see\nScheumann 2020, 59\u201360) that may influence the phonological\nrealisation of the conjunction waw with qames\u0323, including syn-\ntactic distribution (see Gesenius 1910; Revell 1981; Waltke and\nO\u2019Connor 1990; Jo\u00fcon and Muraoka 2006; van der Merwe et al.\n2017), semantics (Waltke and O\u2019Connor 1990; van der Merwe et\nal. 2017; see also Revell 2015; 2016), and rhythm (Gesenius\n1910; Jo\u00fcon and Muraoka 2006).\nThe fifth attribute of complex systems is emergence. Com-\nplex systems exhibit emergent behaviour when dynamic interac-\ntions between lower-level components and dimensions of the\nsystem give rise to new phenomena that contribute to the nature\nof the system (Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 58\u201360;\nMarais 2019b, 47\u201349). For example, \u201csubatomic particles give\nrise to atoms, atoms to molecules, molecules to organisms; or\nphonemes to words, words to propositions, propositions to Complexity Theory 285\ndiscourses\u201d (Reid 2021, 33). In each case, the whole of the sys-\ntem\u2014organism or discourse\u2014is not simply the sum of its parts,\nbut what emerges when the parts of the system interact. Ellis and\nLarsen-Freeman (2009a, 14\u201315) describe both idiolects and\ndialects as characteristically emergent:\nLanguage exists both in individuals (as idiolect) and in the\ncommunity of users (as communal language). Language is\nemergent at these two distinctive but interdependent\nlevels: An idiolect is emergent from an individual\u2019s lan-\nguage use through social interactions with other indi-\nviduals in the communal language, whereas a communal\nlanguage is emergent as the result of the interaction of the\nidiolects.\nThe sixth attribute of complex systems is nonlinearity.\nLarsen-Freeman and Cameron (2008, 31) define this feature as\n\u201cchange that is not proportional to input\u201d (2008, 31; see also\nBeckner et al. 2009, 16). An idiom is perhaps a simple example\nof nonlinearity because it is semantically non-compositional\u2014the\nmeaning of the whole expression (viz. output) cannot be derived\nfrom the meaning of its individual parts (viz. input; van den\nHeever 2013, II:106\u2013110, 178).2 For example, the input of \ufb2a\u05e7\u05d1\n(\u2018seek\u2019) and \ufb2a\u05e4\u05e0\u05be\u05ea\u05d0 (\u2018the life\u2019) yields an semantic output of \u2018to\nwant or try to kill someone\u2019, not \u2018to look for someone\u2019s life\u2019 (van\nden Heever 2013, 189\u201390).\n2 Idioms (and their formation) constitute complex phenomena in them-\nselves (see van den Heever 2013). Van den Heever defines semantic\nnon-compositionality as a complex concept \u201cwhose global meaning is a\nsemantic extension of the combined meanings of its constituent\nelements\u201d (2013, 178). 286 Pitcher\nAnother illustration of linguistic non-linearity is the process\nof grammaticalisation whereby a lexical item loses its semantic\ncontent and develops a grammatical function. For example, there\nis abundant cross-linguistic evidence for the diachronic grammat-\nicalisation of the copula into a focus marker (see Heine and Reh\n1984; Harris and Campbell 1995; Heine and Kuteva 2002;\nLehmann 2015; Khan 2019). One of the pathways to grammat-\nicalisation of the copula (viz. input) begins with cleft sentences,\nand over time, in some languages, the copula ceases to serve as\na verb (viz. output), and instead is interpreted as a particle\nmarking focus.3 For the languages where this has not occurred,\nLehmann (2015, 125) states that the very existence of the\n\u201cautonomous pattern\u201d of the cleft sentence demonstrates that\n\u201cthe communicative function of focus is already minimally\ngrammaticalized.\u201d4\nFinally, complex systems are adaptive. Larsen-Freeman and\nCameron (2008) define adaptation as \u201cthe process in which a\nsystem adjusts itself in response to changes in its environment\u201d\n3 In many languages, the cleft sentence is the most explicit way of mark-\ning focus (Lehmann 2015, 123\u201324). An example of a cleft construction\nin English is the sentence \u2018It is X that Y\u2019, where X is the focused NP and\nY is the comment regarding the NP: It is JOHN that loves Mary (Khan\n2019, 14).\n4 In some languages, cleft sentences exhibit evidence of further gram-\nmaticalisation as the syntactic complexity of the construction simplifies\nthrough the loss of certain morphemes, such as the relativiser introduc-\ning the subordinate clause: \u2018It is X Y\u2019 (Khan 2019, 15; see also Lehmann\n2015, 124). Khan (2019, 15) provides examples of this type of cleft\nsentence in Israeli Hebrew and Syriac. Complexity Theory 287\n(2008, 33). This attribute is evident in the written transmission\nof sacred texts, where editors adapt their translations to accom-\nmodate a variety of editorial considerations (see Naud\u00e9 and\nMiller-Naud\u00e9 2019, 201, 182\u201383; Reid 2021, 38\u201341). For exam-\nple, Samaritan scribes chose to continue to use the paleo-Hebrew\nscript instead of adopting the Aramaic square script. By doing so,\nthey created an immediate visual distinctive for readers of the\nSamaritan Pentateuch (Reid 2021, 53). According to Reid (2021,\n53), the social schism between the Judean Jews and Samaritan\nJews encouraged the use of a different script, which \u201ctransformed\nthe visual impact of the manuscript and gave it a Samaritan\nidentity\u201d (2021, 53).\n3.0. Complexity Thinking in Biblical Scholarship\nThis section provides an overview of complexity thinking as\napplied to five distinct areas of biblical scholarship. Naud\u00e9 and\nMiller-Naud\u00e9 have pioneered this approach, exploring complex-\nity models for diachrony (\u00a73.1), language pedagogy (\u00a73.2), and\nthe translation of sacred texts (\u00a73.3). This framework has been\nextended to include a complexity model for the Masoretic accents\nof the Tiberian Masoretic Reading Tradition (Pitcher 2020; \u00a73.5),\na complexity approach to syntactic coordination in Biblical\nHebrew (Scheumann 2020; \u00a73.4), and a paradigm for under-\nstanding the Samaritan Pentateuch as an intralingual translation\n(Reid 2021; \u00a73.3). 288 Pitcher\n3.1. Diachrony\nNaud\u00e9 (2012) models a complexity approach to the description\nof language change and diffusion in Biblical Hebrew. His stated\naim for this approach (2012, 61) is to promote \u201cviewing the\ndiverse aspects of language change holistically (that is, under-\nstanding the causal dependencies and emergent processes among\nthe elements that constitute the whole system) rather than\nviewing them partially and in isolation.\u201d Naud\u00e9 enumerates four\nfundamental dimensions of language change and diffusion that\nmust be accounted for in any substantive systems description of\ndiachrony: (1) the dimension of the individual idiolect, (2) the\nsocial dimension within a community of speakers, (3) the dimen-\nsion of the process of chronological change over time, and (4) the\ndevelopment of written texts. He argues that an understanding of\nthe dynamic interplay between each of these dimensions renders\n\u201cthe simple linear model of Ancient Biblical Hebrew, Early Bibli-\ncal Hebrew, Late Biblical Hebrew, and Mishnaic Hebrew\u201d unten-\nable, yielding a more accurate and complex model of the lan-\nguage development (2012, 71).\nWithin his system of diachrony, Naud\u00e9 (2012, 72) describes\nthe dimension of the individual as a domain where the formation\nof idiolects arises from the \u201cinnate grammar of an individual\nspeaker.\u201d He states that language change at this level reflects the\ndifferences between the grammar of the individual and \u201cthat of\nthe input source (for example, child versus parents).\u201d Change at\nthis level is ongoing throughout the individual\u2019s life and \u201calways\nemergent\u201d (2012, 72) as cognition develops and continues to Complexity Theory 289\nshape the individual\u2019s competencies in the use of grammar (2012,\n70, 72; see also Giv\u00f3n 2009).\nThe social dimension of diachrony encompasses the changes\nthat emerge within the dialects of communities of speakers. In\nthis dimension, the diffusion of idiolects is at work, as \u201cone dif-\nfering grammar becomes dominant and gains acceptance by the\nlocal speech community and later by society at large\u201d (Naud\u00e9\n2012, 72). Naud\u00e9 notes that diffusion always involves multiple\nidiolects that are at once competing with and being influenced\nby the standard language.\nThe dimension of time recognises that language change and\ndiffusion are processes that develop chronologically and often in\nobservable patterns (2012, 72\u201373; see also Pintzuk 2003).\nAccording to Naud\u00e9 (2012, 73), linguistic structures accumulate\nthrough the daily communicative interactions of speakers in a\ncommunity, many of which are culturally transmitted to future\ngenerations in the form of \u201cfossilized linguistic structures.\u201d The\ncomplex process by which some linguistic structures (e.g., mor-\nphological, phonological, syntactic) \u201cpersist for millennia,\u201d while\nother structures simplify or completely erode, is called the \u201cdia-\nchronic cycle.\u201d It is through this cycle that language undergoes\n\u201cdeep structured changes.\u201d\nThe fourth dimension of diachrony is the development of\nwritten texts. In order to account for this dimension, Naud\u00e9\n(2012, 73) asserts that the differences between speech and writ-\ning must be identified. One fundamental difference is that\n\u201cwriting is secondary to speech and employs special forms\u2026 for\nits unique purposes (for example, the use of devices for the 290 Pitcher\norganization of discourse).\u201d Understanding these differences\nincludes accounting for the use of the text and the context out of\nwhich it arises.\nFor example, for Biblical Hebrew, it is important to under-\nstand the context of the Ancient Near East, where the written text\nwas often used as an administrative tool and did not necessarily\nreflect \u201ca connection with spoken language\u201d (Naud\u00e9 2012, 73);\nthis was an \u201cadvantage for [outstretched empires] and linguisti-\ncally unrelated agents.\u201d Naud\u00e9 (2012, 74\u201375) argues that this\ncontextual description must also consider the socio-cultural\nnature of the epigraphic and biblical texts, including scribal\nculture; the political and economic circumstances at the time of\ncomposition or redaction; the types of discourses produced (viz.\nroyal, history, law, prophecy) and the audiences they address\n(viz. the monarchy, the people, personal second person versus\nimpersonal third person). Furthermore, biblical texts have an\nadded layer of complexity because \u201cthey were transmitted\nthrough multiple editors and copyists, rather than archaeologi-\ncally excavated straight from their original context\u201d (2012, 74).\nNaud\u00e9 maintains that all these factors must be considered when\nexplaining the process of diachrony in biblical languages.\nNaud\u00e9 (2012, 75) illustrates the complexity of the dia-\nchronic cycle that \u201cbegan in Biblical Hebrew, escalated in\nQumran Hebrew, and was finished in Mishnaic Hebrew\u201d using\ndata \u201con the waw-consecutive and distribution of the independ-\nent personal pronouns in Biblical and Qumran Hebrew.\u201d He\ntraces the chronological use of consecutive waw with perfective\nverb forms and notes that this form is statistically more prevalent Complexity Theory 291\nin Biblical Hebrew than Qumran Hebrew, and almost completely\nabsent in Mishnaic Hebrew (2012, 76\u201377). While changes in\nthese verbal forms throughout the various stages of Hebrew have\nbeen well-documented (2012, 77, n. 2), the theory of diachrony\nthat Naud\u00e9 (2012, 77\u201378) develops explains their significance:\nIn the biblical period, the change occurred in one or more\nidiolects. The change then diffused so that, by the time of\nQumran, there were fewer examples of the consecutive\nform and more examples of conjunctive waw. The exam-\nples of consecutive forms that remained were stylistic fos-\nsils. By the time of the Mishnah, the cycle of change was\ncomplete: the consecutive forms occurred only in biblical\nquotations, and the vernacular language was structurally\ndifferent from the language in the Bible.\nThe system of diachrony advanced in Naud\u00e9 (2012) moves tra-\nditional descriptions of language development beyond notions\nthat characterise the various forms and stages of biblical lan-\nguages according to the \u201csynchronic styles available to biblical\nauthors\u201d (2012, 71).\n3.2. Language Pedagogy\nMiller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2014) present a complex systems\napproach to teaching and learning Biblical Hebrew by reading the\nbiblical text\u2014an approach that systematises some of the best\nteaching practices for Biblical Hebrew instruction. The method-\nology they employ is based on pedagogical complexity models,\nwhich assume a theory of second language development that is\nmulti-dimensional and involves \u201ca process of dynamic adaptation\u201d 292 Pitcher\n(2014, 95; see Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008; Ellis and\nLarsen-Freeman 2009a).5\nMiller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2014, 92) select the act of read-\ning as the basis of an effective complexity model for teaching\nbiblical languages because the act of reading requires a range of\ncomplex skills ranging from \u201clower-level visual processing\ninvolved in decoding the print to higher-level skills involving\nsyntax, semantics, and discourse, and even to skills of text rep-\nresentation and integration of ideas with the reader\u2019s global\nknowledge\u201d (Nassaji 2009, 173). Furthermore, they argue that\nthe socio-political context of their classroom at a South African\nuniversity itself provides grounds for developing such an\napproach. Their description of \u201cthe \u2018new\u2019 South Africa (since\n1994)\u201d (2014, 92) celebrates a country with twelve official lan-\nguages and the integration of peoples who were once rigidly sep-\narated from one another. Accordingly, one key dimension of their\npedagogical approach has been to hire a multi-cultural and multi-\nlingual teaching staff that is able not only to teach in multiple\nlanguages (viz. Afrikaans, English, Sesotho), but also to provide\nparallel linguistic examples and explanations of Hebrew linguis-\ntic structures in these diverse languages.\nAnother key contextual dimension that Miller-Naud\u00e9 and\nNaud\u00e9\u2019s (2014) pedagogical model accounts for is the manner\nin which South Africa\u2019s national teaching requirements train\n5 The model of language development proposed here contrasts with\nmodels of language acquisition which describe learners accessing a\nfixed \u201cmental architecture of language\u201d (Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 2014,\n95). Complexity Theory 293\nstudents to learn new information. They observe that these\nmodes of learning tend to conflict with traditional methods for\nteaching Biblical Hebrew. Particularly, they have found that\nSouth Africa\u2019s outcomes-based educational system is focused \u201ctoo\nmuch on the application of knowledge\u201d (2014, 93):\nAs a result, students/learners typically have not acquired\nthe skills for memorization. Traditionally, the teaching of\nBiblical Hebrew has relied upon memorization for the\nacquisition of vocabulary and verbal paradigms, but this\nmethod is almost impossible for students whose previous\nacademic experience has exclusively relied on Outcomes\nBased Learning (2014, 93).\nThe six dimensions of Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9\u2019s (2014) com-\nplexity model for teaching Biblical Hebrew are as follows: (1) the\nuse of a typological framework for introducing grammatical fea-\ntures, (2) the use of the five complex cognitive skills that must be\ndeveloped when learning to read, (3) building students\u2019 vocabu-\nlary, (4) reading, singing, listening, and simplified speaking, (5)\nincreasing students\u2019 understanding of the cultural context of the\nbiblical text, and (6) the application of exegesis and theology to\nthe biblical text.\nThe first dimension of the model involves establishing a\ntypological framework for teaching the grammatical features of\nthe biblical language. A typological framework is particularly\nsuited for this because it classifies languages that are \u201cgenetically\nunrelated and that have no geographical proximity\u201d (2014, 96)\naccording to \u201cshared formal characteristics\u201d (Whaley 1997, 7).\nMiller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 argue that language typology is a key\npedagogical feature because it allows instructors \u201cto describe the 294 Pitcher\ngrammatical features of [the biblical language] to speakers with\ndifferent mother tongues\u201d (2014, 96). For example, they observe\nthat English- and Afrikaans-speaking students often find the\nHebrew construct phrase more difficult to grasp because in these\nlanguages \u201cthe genitive precedes the noun\u2026 a predominant\npattern among the world\u2019s languages\u201d (2014, 96). However,\nspeakers of African languages such as Sesotho quickly grasp this\nconcept because the noun-genitive pattern in these languages\ncorresponds to the pattern found in Hebrew. Miller-Naud\u00e9 and\nNaud\u00e9 (2014, 96\u201397) state that these types of conceptual difficul-\nties with the features of a biblical language can be mitigated by\nexplaining them in terms of the typological differences found\namong the languages of the world.\nThe second dimension of the model is quite complex in\nitself because it incorporates the five following cognitive skills of\nreading (2014, 97\u201398): (1) learning to interpret and pronounce\nthe orthography; (2) developing the ability to visually process\nwords (viz. learning to identify a word by recognising the string\nof consonants); (3) developing reading comprehension skills by\nlearning to \u201c[select] the meaning of the word that is relevant\nto the context\u201d (2014, 98); (4) learning to identify discourse-\nlevel features;6 and (5) learning to interpret \u201cculturally relevant\n6 According to Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2014, 98), discourse-level\nfeatures include \u201ccompound sentences, identification of the narrative\nstructures of on-line and off-line information, volitive chains, the\nembedding of direct and indirect speech, and genre-specific features\nsuch as poetic lineation and poetic word pairs.\u201d Complexity Theory 295\ninformation for processing the pragmatic inferences of biblical\ntexts\u201d (2014, 97).\nThe third dimension of the model encompasses the teach-\ning of vocabulary. For Miller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2014, 100),\nvocabulary instruction includes equipping students with not only\nsound files for hearing and pronouncing words but also the cul-\nturally relevant information needed to understand them in their\ntextual contexts.\nThe fourth dimension of the model involves several key\nactivities\u2014reading, singing, listening, and simplified speaking\u2014\nthat all reinforce new skills and allow students to integrate and\npractise the concepts that they are being taught. For example,\nreading activities include both an intensive and an extensive\ncomponent. Intensive reading \u201cinvolves close, deliberate study of\nshort texts with attention to vocabulary, grammar and discourse\nof the text\u201d (2014, 102), while extensive reading \u201cinvolves a wide\nrange of texts of different genres, text structures and language\npatterns.\u201d Additionally, students are provided with audio files of\ntheir classroom materials, which affords them ample opportunity\nto listen to the biblical language. Finally, singing biblical verses\nand performing simplified oral drills and dialogues reinforces\n\u201cspecific morphological forms, syntactic constructions and\nvocabulary items\u201d (2014, 101) in engaging ways.\nThe fifth dimension of the model provides students with the\nnecessary cultural information regarding the ancient biblical\nworld so that they can \u201cbridge the gap between their cultural\ncontext\u2026 and that of ancient Israel\u201d (2014, 100). 296 Pitcher\nFinally, the sixth dimension of the model involves the\napplication of exegesis and theology to the biblical text. For\nMiller-Naud\u00e9 and Naud\u00e9 (2014, 100), this is the \u201cultimate goal\nof Biblical Hebrew language teaching\u201d and the reward for stu-\ndents within the religious context of their institution. This dimen-\nsion enables students to apply and appreciate their growing\nknowledge of the language and culture of the biblical text.\n3.3. Translation Theory\nMarais (2019b, 43; see also 2014) describes translation as a com-\nplex process that emerges out of cause-and-effect relationships\namong a variety of dimensions, including \u201clinguistics, pragmat-\nics, culture, society, ideology, power, a brain, a human personal-\nity and meaning\u201d (2019b, 46\u201347). Marais (2019b, 44) argues that\nthe process of translation\u2014that is, \u201cthe process of making mean-\ning\u201d\u2014is fundamentally a sign-process (viz. semiosis), entailing\nthe interrelatedness of three elements: (1) the sign, (2) a mental\nrepresentation of the referent triggered by the sign, and (3) the\nactual referent, \u201ceither an idea of something or the thing itself.\u201d\nConceptualising translation as a process means that the mental\nconstruct is only relevant for \u201ca particular moment in the semio-\nsis\u201d\u2014that is, the mental construct is \u201cnot absolutely final, only\npragmatically final\u201d (2019b, 44).\nFurthermore, Marais (2019b, 43, 46) argues that the incipi-\nent text is as much an emergent phenomenon as the subsequent\ntext, and that the process of translating is not linear or binary\u2014\nthere is no direct line from incipient text to subsequent text. For\nMarais (2014; 2019b, 46), a complexity model for translation not Complexity Theory 297\nonly means that the translation process is recursive but also that\nthe \u2018turns\u2019 of translation are not mutually exclusive. As such,\nprevious translations of a text are not invalidated by subsequent\nones, but instead are viewed as \u201ccomplementary perspectives\nthat contribute to a fuller understanding of the complexity of\ntranslation\u201d (2019b, 46; see also Robinson 2017).\nNaud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2019) explore Marais\u2019 complexi-\nty model using the Book of Ben Sira in the Septuagint as a case\nstudy. Their complexity framework for Ben Sira serves as an\nalternative to the frameworks that are utilised in two recent\nmodern translations\u2014namely, the Septuaginta Deutsch project\n(LXX.D) and the New English Translation of the Septuagint project\n(NETS).7 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2019, 181) consider these\ntranslations to be reductionist approaches because the former\ndomesticates the text, while the latter renders it foreign to the\nreader. For example, NETS employs a literal translation of the\nGreek and incorporates transliterated terms. They observe the\nopposite, but equally reductionist, phenomenon with LXX.D as it\nveers too heavily in the direction of favouring German culture at\nthe expense of the culture of the incipient text (2019, 181).\nMarais (2014, 40) describes the pull of these types of reductionist\ntranslation models as either being \u201ctoo strongly biased toward\nthe direction of the target [text],\u201d as in the case of LXX.D, or \u201ctoo\nstrongly biased toward the source [text],\u201d as in the case of NETS.\nNaud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 argue that their complexity\napproach to Ben Sira resolves this stark dichotomy by both\n7 See Ross (2021) for an overview of the range of recent Septuagint\ntranslation projects. 298 Pitcher\n\u201crespecting its alterity\u201d (2019, 203) and being sensitive to \u201cissues\nof intelligibility and representation.\u201d They accomplish this by\nidentifying two sets of dimensions that are inherent in sacred\nwritings and incorporating them into the production of the trans-\nlated text, largely in the form of footnotes.\nThe first set of dimensions characterise the religious nature\nof sacred texts. These dimensions explore the psychological and\nsociological aspects of religion, as well as the influence that the\noral-writing traditions of the text have wielded over time. The\npsychological dimension \u201cinfluences how individuals perceive\nand react to the environment in which they live,\u201d while the socio-\nlogical dimension encompasses a complex nexus of \u201cintercultural\nand interlinguistic communication influenced by socio-cultural,\norganizational, and situational factors that result in self-critical\ncorrections, adaptations, and apologies in religious discourse and\npractice\u201d (2019, 182). Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2019, 181\u2013182)\nobserve:\nSacred writings, which are texts beyond everyday life that\ninspire awe, respect, and even fear, are associated with\nreligion and have various special functions or roles within\na religious context (Sawyer 1999). As a complex phenome-\nnon, religion and its sacred writings form an inextricable\npart of culture. Religion is a central part of human experi-\nence, influencing how individuals perceive and react to the\nenvironments in which they live (Giddens 1993, 456).\nNaud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2019, 182) describe the oral-writing\ntradition of sacred texts as the words, texts, and language used in\npublic worship, \u201cwhich are the result of complex processes of\ncanonization and translation.\u201d They also recognise that most Complexity Theory 299\nreligious communities require translated versions of their sacred\ntexts, and that these texts \u201cquickly assume the status of incipient\n(source) texts and become central to the religious domain.\u201d\nSacred writings, then, exhibit complex webs of interaction\nbetween numerous emergent, complex adaptive systems\u2014\nthe religious communities who produce and use sacred\nwritings, the sacred writings as emergent incipient\n(source) texts, the sacred writings as emergent subsequent\n(target) texts, and in some instances, subsequent (target)\ntexts as emergent sacred writings (Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\n2019, 183).\nThe second set of contextual dimensions for the complexity\nmodel accounts for the complex nature of the Septuagint and the\nplace of Ben Sira within it. According to Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\n(2019, 183\u201384), the Septuagint is itself a complex adaptive\nsystem for the following historical, text-critical, editorial, and\nsocio-cultural reasons: (1) it has a complex history of origin and\ntransmission; (2) the source text(s) for the translated texts of the\nSeptuagint are pluriform and emergent \u201cin that it did not reach\nits final, canonical form until many centuries later\u201d (see also\nUlrich 2015); (3) the Septuagint comprises \u201cmultiple translations\n(e.g., into Latin and Syriac) and revisions (e.g., by Aquila and\nSymmachus)\u201d that were produced to serve the \u201cneeds and\nconcerns of various religious communities, especially since the\nProtestant Reformation;\u201d (4) although originally produced for\nJews, they subsequently rejected it after it was adopted by\nChristians as their sacred text.8 Furthermore, according to Naud\u00e9\n8 For an alternative view regarding this claim, see De Lange et al. 2009. 300 Pitcher\nand Miller-Naud\u00e9, while \u201cresearch on the Septuagint has been\ndriven primarily by the needs of textual criticism and modern\nphilology, either as a search for the Vorlage or Urtext (earliest)\nor as a search for the best or most authoritative final text,\u201d a new\nphilology approach to the Septuagint views each individual\nmanuscript \u201cas a meaningful, historical artifact, and variants\nfound in these manuscripts are viewed... interesting in their own\nright.\u201d9\nNaud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 argue that a complexity model\nfor Ben Sira, then, considers and incorporates these multiple\ndimensions. One of their strategies for avoiding foreignising or\ndomesticating the text is by making use of footnotes in order to\nboth provide the modern reader with access to the alterity (viz.\nforeignness) of the Hebrew incipient text and make this alterity\ncomprehensible.\nFor example, Ben Sira 24.13\u201317 depicts Lady Wisdom in\nterms of \u201ca variety of flora that are mentioned in their ecological\ncontexts\u201d (2019, 189). According to Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9\n(2019, 190), since this portion of text lacks a Hebrew incipient\ntext, these terms must be translated with respect to \u201cboth the cul-\ntural world of ancient Israel and the appropriation of those cul-\ntural terms in metaphorical contexts.\u201d In this poetic passage, they\n9 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2019, 184) state that \u201cnew philology as a\nphilological perspective within the larger field of editorial theory pro-\nvides a model broadly conceived for understanding texts, text produc-\ntion, and transmission\u2014and for exploring texts in their manuscript\ncontexts.\u201d Note that Brill\u2019s Septuagint Commentary Series assumes this\napproach (see Porter 2021 for a description). Complexity Theory 301\nprovide three examples where the NETS translation chooses an\nEnglish term whose referent either is not found in Israel or does\nnot fit the metaphorical function of the plant in the passage, or\nboth (2019, 190\u201393). Furthermore, in instances where additional\ninformation is needed to fill out a modern reader\u2019s understanding\nof the term, footnotes \u201copen up the cultural world of the text to\nthe modern reader by indicating both the botanical characteris-\ntics and the social functions of the plant. The alterity of the text\nis retained and respected but without domestication of its for-\neignness\u201d (2019, 193). For Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2019, 193),\nfootnotes are powerful metatexts that help retain the complexity\nof text by making the alterity of the incipient text accessible and\nintelligible to a modern reader.\nFollowing Marais (2014; 2019a; 2019b) and Naud\u00e9 and\nMiller-Naud\u00e9\u2019s (2019) models for translation, Reid (2021) demon-\nstrates a similar use of complexity principles in his analysis of the\nSamaritan Pentateuch as an intralingual translation\u2014that is, a\nrewording or reinterpretation of a text in the same language. Reid\npresents a paradigm for understanding the Samaritan Penta-\nteuch, particularly, the variants found in the text, \u201cthe choices\nmade by the editors\u2026 the context they worked in, and the reason\nthey embarked on the project\u201d (2021, 2). Unlike interlingual\ntranslations that \u201cmight be done simply to facilitate communica-\ntion between speakers of different languages\u201d (2021, 50), Reid\nargues that \u201cintralingual translations must be done for a particu-\nlar reason or skopos, as the original material is already accessible 302 Pitcher\nin the target language.\u201d10 Reid concludes that the skopos for the\nSamaritan Pentateuch is rooted in a particular set of scribal\ninterventions that emerge from a complex interaction of multiple\ntexts\u2014e.g., proto-Masoretic, pre-Samaritan, Septuagint (2021,\n10\u201322, 71)\u2014and multi-dimensional factors, including (1) the\ndiachronic development of the Samaritan dialect and inter-\ndialectic variants (2021, 59\u201360); (2) editorial considerations,\ne.g., choosing to preserve the paleo-Hebrew script (2021, 53) and\nsubstituting archaic grammatical forms for those that were more\ncommonly used (2021, 58); and (3) the \u201ccultural rich points\u201d that\ndifferentiate the Jewish and Samaritan traditions, e.g., the\ncorrect place of worship, Gerizim versus Jerusalem, (2021, 60\u2013\n64).\n3.4. Syntax\nScheumann (2020) applies complexity thinking to the grammat-\nical feature of phrasal coordination in Biblical Hebrew because\nhe recognises that \u201csemantic observations of clausal coordina-\ntion\u201d do not yield a comprehensive description of coordination,\nand that a purely syntactic analysis is equally insufficient (2020,\n11). His complexity approach provides a metatheory for the\nMinimalist Programme (see Chomsky 1995) that undergirds his\nsyntactic analysis, allowing for other relevant dimensions of\nlanguage to be considered (2020, 6, 10):\n10 In accordance with Vermeer (2004), Reid defines skopos as \u201cthe aim\nor purpose of a translation\u201d (Vermeer 2004, 227; see also Reiss and\nVermeer 2014; Nord 2018). Complexity Theory 303\nI approach [Biblical Hebrew] language as a connected\nwhole with the interacting levels of syntax, semantics,\nprosody, morphophonology, and discourse.\u2026 Moreover,\nbecause coordination is so pervasive in the Pentateuch, it\nrequires a grasp of many areas of [Biblical Hebrew] syntax\nthat intersect with phrasal coordination: prosody, pronoun\nbinding, information structure, word order, null elements,\nellipsis, differential object marking, prepositions, nega-\ntion, markedness, apposition, subordination, and verbal\nagreement.\nUsing cross-linguistic data to support his claim for the syntactic\nstructure of coordination in Biblical Hebrew, Scheumann (2020,\n30\u201332, 56) proposes an asymmetric, hierarchical structure based\non the following complex features: (1) asymmetric prosodic\nbreaks exhibiting the segmentation between conjuncts at the\nphrasal and clausal levels (2020, 30); (2) the cliticisation of the\ncoordinating particle to one of the conjuncts (2020, 30\u201331); (3)\nsyntactic constraints on the locus of a coordinator within a clause\n(2020, 31); (4) constraints on which conjuncts are able to do the\njoining or binding within a clause (2020, 32); and (5) asymme-\ntries between verbal agreement and the structure of coordination\n(2020, 224\u201325).\nScheumann observes that his hierarchical model for coor-\ndination has implications for understanding instances of partial\nverbal agreement and conjoined subjects (e.g., 2 Sam. 2.12). He\nconcludes that partial agreement is the default pattern when the\ncoordinate complex is post-verbal (e.g., Gen. 33.7), and that \u201cthe\nverb always agrees with the initial conjunct (e.g., Exod. 21.4),\nwhether the coordinate complex is post-verbal or pre-verbal\u201d\n(2020, 227). 304 Pitcher\nWhile Scheumann determines that syntax is the primary\nfactor for understanding coordination and verbal agreement\nasymmetries, he recognises that syntactic analysis alone is insuf-\nficient to explain the different types of asymmetries that are\nfound in Biblical Hebrew (2020, 238, 261). Having established\nthe underlying syntactic structure for coordination, he deter-\nmines (2020, 246\u201349, 261) that the role discourse plays in the\npartial agreement of verbs with coordinated subjects is more\naccurately understood when considered together with other fac-\ntors such as conjunct word order, conjunct binding (viz. a coref-\nerential pronoun that binds to the second conjunct [2020, 84]),\nand the subsequent use of pro-drop (2020, 262):\nWe have seen that in sentences with a post-verbal coordi-\nnate structure headed by a pronoun, the number of the\nverb is noteworthy. The compound is not the subject, but\nfunctions as a [quantifier phrase] that modifies the subject.\nA singular verb, thus, has discourse significance, because\nthe subject is singular, which is coreferential with the\npronoun conjunct. In this way, the pronoun referent is the\nprincipal actor because, syntactically, it is the only actor\nin terms of subjecthood. The prominence of the pronoun is\nhighlighted further with conjunct binding and with a\nsubsequent singular pro-drop verb. Conversely, a plural\nverb does not mark the conjuncts as equally-prominent\nactors. While both conjuncts in the [quantifier phrase]\nexplicate the plural pro subject reference, the initial\nconjunct in the [quantifier phrase] can still be discourse-\nprominent, much like how the first conjunct in a com-\npound subject can be the principal actor, whether the verb\nis singular or plural. Complexity Theory 305\n3.5. Masoretic Accents of the Tiberian Masoretic\nReading Tradition\nThe current accepted analytical model for the Masoretic accents\nof the Tiberian Masoretic Reading Tradition is rooted in a\nnineteenth-century philological algorithm known as the Law of\nContinuous Dichotomy (LCD, Wickes 1887), which reduces (i.e.,\nartificially simplifies) the accents to a system of pausal segmen-\ntation. However, Pitcher\u2019s (2020; 2023; see also 2021) model for\nthe accentual system departs from the LCD as a tool of analysis\nin order to advance a complexity approach that integrates the\nsystem\u2019s features, structures, and functions within a wholly\nlinguistic framework. Pitcher argues that LCD-based analyses\ncannot appropriately account for or accommodate the complex\nlinguistic data represented by the accentual system, and should,\ntherefore, be replaced by a cross-linguistic complexity model for\nsix main reasons: (1) LCD-based algorithms were designed to\nreconstruct the \u2018correct\u2019 sequences of accents in a verse (Wickes\n1881, Preface, 5\u20137; see also Pitcher 2023), not to identify and\nexplain the complex linguistic data that they represent; (2) schol-\nars have long acknowledged the prosodic nature of the system\n(Spanier 1927; Lazarus 1942; Avenary 1963; Janis 1987; Dresher\n1994; Strauss 2009; DeCaen and Dresher 2020; Park 2020), but\nthe LCD does not treat the accents as natural speech phenomena;\n(3) the LCD is a philological algorithm with no theoretical basis\noutside of itself; (4) the LCD reduces the accentual system to\npausal segmentation; (5) a cross-linguistic complexity model\nprovides a more accurate description of the accentual system,\nintegrating its seemingly disparate features (viz. melody, stress, 306 Pitcher\nprosodic phrase structure, syntax interface, and meaning); and\n(6) a cross-linguistic complexity model provides the necessary\ntheoretical framework to test and substantiate the complex dimen-\nsions of the accentual system\u2019s features, structures, and functions.\nAt its core, a cross-linguistic complexity model for the accentual\nsystem recognises that the multifaceted dimensions of lan-\nguage\u2014including tonal and metrical structure, syntax, seman-\ntics, and discourse-pragmatics\u2014comprise a prosodic system, and\nthis model seeks to account for these dimensions within a com-\nprehensive linguistic analysis.\nThe basis for this new analysis is partly grounded in the\noral orientation of traditional descriptions of the accents and the\nnotion of recitation found therein (see Spanier 1927, 9\u201317;\nCrowther 2015, 54\u201363; Eldar 2018, 53\u201356; Shoshany 2022, 23\u2013\n24, 27\u201328; see also Khan 2013, 37, 43, 47; Khan 2020a, 1\u20133, 49\u2013\n53), as well as the system\u2019s close association with the vocalic\nphonology of the orally performed text (Khan 2013, 37\u201365; Eldar\n2018, 85\u201388; Khan 2020a, 96\u201397, 2020b, 1\u20133; Posegay 2021,\n25\u201326, 38\u201342, 82\u201384, 131; see also Crowther 2015, 50\u201351, 62\u2013\n63). Furthermore, according to Yeivin (1980, 158), the accents\nare traditionally understood to perform three functions: (1) to\nrepresent the melodies that accompany the reading of the text,\n(2) to mark the locus of lexical stress, and (3) to mark semantic\nunits (1980, 158)\u2014that is, to contribute to the meaning of the\ntext. A cross-linguistic complexity model unifies these functions\nwithin the theoretical framework of prosodic phonology. Within\nthis model, the accentual graphemes constitute a prosodic\northography, where conjunctive and disjunctive graphemes are Complexity Theory 307\niconic representations of pitch accents at three levels of contras-\ntive pitch\u2014low, high, and extra high (Pitcher 2023; see also\nWickes 1887, 13\u201314; Lazarus 1942, 283\u201386; Pitcher 2020, 145\u2013\n58, 189\u201392;)\u2014embedded within two domains of prosodic phrase\nstructure. In other words, the orthography of the accents repre-\nsents pitch fluctuations in the flow of speech that are associated\nwith the locus of lexical stress, with disjunctive accents addition-\nally indicating the locus of two types of cross-linguistically dis-\ntinct phrasal boundaries\u2014namely, those of the intermediate\nphrase (\u03c6) and the intonational phrase (\u03b9).\nThis cross-linguistic complexity model, however, not only\nidentifies the precise nature of the accentual system but also pro-\nvides a way to assess its functional semantic features. For exam-\nple, relative clauses, which have attested cross-linguistic prosodic\nfeatures (Nespor and Vogel 2007, 188), provide an accessible\nsyntactic domain to test how the prosodic system represented by\nthe accents contributes to the meaning of the biblical text.\nSemantically non-restrictive relative clauses, which provide sup-\nplemental information for an already identifiable referent, form\nintonational phrases separate from their head nouns. Semanti-\ncally restrictive relative clauses, which modify the head noun by\nrestricting the identification of the referent, form cohesive into-\nnational phrases with their head nouns.11\n11 The prosodic data of relative clauses within the 21 Books of the\nHebrew Bible also include prosodic formats that are prosodically ambig-\nuous with regard to restriction (Pitcher 2020, 333\u201355).

Using a\ncross-linguistic framework, Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2017, 233)\nnote that syntactic left dislocation \u201cinvolves a gap at the bound-\nary between the dislocated constituent and the matrix sentence,\u201d\nwhich can be realised by a pause, interjection (Berman-Aronson\nand Grosu 1976), or intonational contour (Korchin 2015, 14\u201315).\nNaud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 use this gap feature to disambiguate the\nsubject NP of a tripartite verbless clause from a left-dislocated NP\nconstruction. They observe that a left-dislocated NP in the bibli-\ncal text is phonologically characterised by a disjunctive accent\nthat separates it from the matrix clause, while the pronoun of a\ntripartite clause (PRON) is phonologically conjoined to the sub-\nject NP. The prosodic formats of these two types of constructions\nconfirm this analysis.\nExample (3) exhibits the prosodic format of a left-\ndislocated verbless construction, where a prosodic phrase bound-\nary separates the 3ms subject pronoun ( \u05d0\ufb35\u05d4\u05b7\u0596 ) from the topicalised\nNP (\u05dd \u05d7\u05b8\u0595\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b0 ).\n(3) \u03b9(\u03c6(\u05dd\u05d7\u05b8\u0595\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b0))\n\u03b9(\u03c6(\u05c3\u05df\u05e2 \u05e0\u05b5\u05bd\u05b8\u05db\u05b0 \u05d9\u05d1\u05a5\u05b4\u05d0\u05b2 ) \u03c6(\u05d0\ufb35 \u05d4\u05b7\u0596 ))\n((and.Ham)\u03c6)\u03b9\n((he)\u03c6 (father.of Canaan)\u03c6)\u03b9\n\u2018As for Ham, he was the father of Canaan.\u2019 (Gen. 9:18) 310 Pitcher\nExample (4) exhibits the prosodic format of a tripartite\nconstruction, where the 3ms pronoun ( \u05d0\ufb35\u05d4\u05b7\u0596 , i.e., PRON) shares the\nsame internal intermediate phrase with the subject NP ( \u05dd\ufb2a\u05a5\u05b8\ufb2f\u05d4\u05b8 ).12\n(4) \u03b9(\u03c6(\u05df\u05d4\u0594 \u05b9\ufb3b\u05dc ) \u03c6(\u05d0\u05b8\u0599 \ufb35\u05d4 \u05dd\ufb2a\u05a5\u05b8 \u05d0\u05b8 \u05d4\u05b8 )\u03c6(\u05ea\u05d0\ufb38\u05b8 \u05d7 \ufb3b \u05b7\u05a0 ) \u03c6(\u05d9\ufb3b\u05b4 \u05b4\u05a1 ))\n((for)\u03c6 (as.the.sin-offering)\u03c6 (the.guilt-offering PRON)\u03c6\n(to.the.priest)\u03c6)\u03b9\n\u2018For just like the sin-offering, the guilt-offering belongs to\nthe priest.\u2019 (Lev. 14:13)\nThese examples demonstrate that a cross-linguistic com-\nplexity approach to the Masoretic accents can more precisely\nidentify and unify what is already known about the system, while\nalso providing scientific avenues for exploring its semantic and\ndiscourse-pragmatic functions.\n4.0. Conclusion\nThis chapter introduced Complexity Theory, a metatheory whose\nprinciples provide a framework for understanding language as a\ncomplex system, in order to introduce the merits and budding\ndevelopments of complexity thinking in the study of biblical\ntexts. The core attributes of a complex system were presented\nalong with an overview of the ways in which complexity thinking\nhas been applied thus far to five areas of biblical scholarship:\ndiachrony, language pedagogy, translation theory, syntax, and\nthe Masoretic accents of the Hebrew Bible. These studies have\ndemonstrated the fruitful outcomes of such an approach and\n12 Naud\u00e9 and Miller-Naud\u00e9 (2017, 223) describe the pronoun in a\ntripartite verbless clause as a \u201clast resort syntactic strategy\u201d for\ndisambiguating the subject NP. Complexity Theory 311\nprovide models for pursuing similar complexity approaches to\nlinguistic research in biblical studies.\nComplexity Theory treats an object of study as part of\nan integrated and dynamic whole, not as an isolated or self-\ncontained phenomenon. Within the domain of language and\nculture, this metatheory aims to describe the complex nature of\nlinguistic phenomena as shaped by the interaction of multiple\ninternal dimensions and external influences, rather than as con-\ntained within a particular autonomous analytical silo. Most cru-\ncially, a complexity approach to biblical scholarship provides the\nresearcher with a model for thinking about the impact of adjacent\nand interrelated phenomena on the object of study, and for\nunderstanding how aspects of biblical languages and texts fit\ninto larger systems of language and culture, ultimately offering\n\u201cgreater coherence in explaining what [is] already know[n]\u201d\n(Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008, 11). A complexity approach,\nthen, can serve as a counterbalance to the powerful scholarly\ninclination to isolate one\u2019s object of study, encouraging the devel-\nopment of a research programme that takes into account the\nlarger systems in which the phenomenon occurs.\n5.0.

The Focus\nmay be marked by word order positions, intonation, or\nlexically.\nFunctional Categories\nCategories within Universal Grammar whose members are\nitems with no descriptive content, namely, D(eterminer), Glossary 327\nT(ense), Asp(ect), M(ood) C (complementiser/coordinator;\ncontrast lexical categories).\nFricative\nA class of consonants articulated with a narrow opening in\nthe vocal tract.\nGeminate\nThe lengthening of consonantal articulation.\nGenerative Linguistics\nA model of linguistic analysis developed by Noam Chomsky\nthat considers grammar as a set of rules that generates gram-\nmatical sentences in any given language from an innate uni-\nversal grammatical structure.\nGlottal\nA class of consonants articulated with the glottis.\nGrammaticalisation\nThe process by which a lexical item loses its semantic con-\ntent and develops a grammatical function.\nHeavy Extraposition\nThe movement of a constituent to the right (final) edge of\nconstruction across a sentence boundary.\nHeavy Topicalisation\nThe movement of a constituent to the left (initial) edge of\na construction across a sentence boundary.\nI-Language\nInternal language (see language competence).\nInformation Structure\nThe way a message is presented to an audience so that new\ninformation is built upon presumably shared information, 328 Linguistic Theory and the Biblical Text\nwhich may be explicit or implicit. The basic terms of infor-\nmation packaging are part of Topic-Comment analysis.\nInterdental\nA place of articulation between the teeth and the tongue.\nIntermediate Phrase\nThe intermediate phrase is the minor phrase domain of the\nprosodic hierarchy above the prosodic word. The intermedi-\nate phrase organises words into a cohesive prosodic unit. It is\nthe main prosodic domain of the syntax-phonology interface.\nIntonational Phrase\nThe intonational phrase is the major phrase domain of the\nprosodic hierarchy above the intermediate phrase. The into-\nnational phrase is primarily associated with post-lexical\nmeaning (viz. meaning above the word).\nIsogloss\nA linguistic innovation linking two or more speech\ncommunities.\nLanguage Competence\nThe finite internal language knowledge of speakers that\nallows them to produce an infinite number of sentences and\ntheir meanings.\nLanguage Diffusion\nA diachronic process by which a dominant language\nspreads.\nLanguage Typology\nA cross-linguistic comparison and classification of lan-\nguages and their components according to shared features.

Glossary 331\nPalatal\nA class of consonants articulated with the palate.\nParameter\nA language feature that may have different \u2018settings\u2019 in dif-\nferent languages (e.g., the pro-drop parameter is present in\nsome languages and absent in other languages).\nPharyngeal\nA class of consonants articulated with the pharynx.\nPhone\nAny distinct sound unit.\nPhoneme\nThe minimal sound unit; a building block for morphemes.\nPhonological Form\nThe final, phonological shape of language at surface structure.\nPitch Accents\nPitch fluctuations in the flow of speech that are associated\nwith accented syllables.\nPro-Drop Parameter\nSee null subject parameter.\nProsodic Hierarchy\nThe prosodic hierarchy is an abstract structure for con-\nceptualising the phonological organisation of constituent\ndomains within the flow of speech (e.g., higher-level con-\nstituents include the prosodic word, intermediate phrase,\nintonational phrase, and utterance). Since prosodic domains\nare organised from syntactic structures, the prosodic hier-\narchy mediates an indirect syntax-phonology interface. 332 Linguistic Theory and the Biblical Text\nProsodic Orthography\nA conventionalised writing system of the phrase structure\nand key phonological and phonetic features (e.g., intona-\ntion, stress, segmentation) of a prosodic system.\nProsodic Phonology\nA subfield of linguistics that provides the cross-linguistic\ntheoretical framework for understanding the complex sys-\ntems of sounds and interfaces that govern the organisation\nof speech.\nProsodic Phrase Structure\nThe grouping of words in an utterance, characterised by\nsmaller units embedded in larger ones.\nProsodic System\nA complex system (viz. interfacing with other dimensions\nof language including phonology, syntax, and discourse-\npragmatics) that regulates the way spoken language is real-\nised. The phonetic features of a prosodic system are pitch,\nstress, segmentation, and voice quality.\nProsodic Word\nAny word in an utterance that bears stress. In the prosodic\northography of Tiberian Hebrew (viz. the Masoretic accen-\ntual system), prosodic words are marked by either conjunc-\ntive or disjunctive graphemes.\nProto-Indo-European\nThe reconstructed ancestor of the Indo-European family of\nlanguages.\nProto-Language\nA reconstructed common ancestor of a family of languages.

Van Valin, in which language is\nconceived as a system of communicative social action and\nwhich focuses on the communicative functions of gram-\nmatical structures.\nSentential Negation\nNegation with scope over the entire sentence.\nSibilant\nA class of fricatives with acoustically prominent amplitude\nand pitch.\nSpirantisation\nThe change from a stop articulation to a fricative.\nStructuralism\nA model of linguistic analysis developed building on the\nworks of Ferdinand de Saussure, in which language is\nconceived as a self-contained system whose elements are\ndefined by their relationship to other elements within the\nsystem.\nStop\nA class of consonants produced by a momentary obstruc-\ntion of airflow in the vocal tract. 334 Linguistic Theory and the Biblical Text\nSurface Structure\nThe overt realisation of language structure.\nSupervised Learning\nA form of machine learning in which the machine learns\nfrom human-labelled examples.\nSuppletive Morphology\nA paradigm with phonemically unrelated morphemes.\nSuprasegmental\nPhonetic features that map across multiple segments.\nSyntax-Phonology Interface\nThe syntax-phonology interface refers to the interaction of\nsyntactic constituents with phonological constituents. It is\nprimarily observed in the phonological rules that reference\nsyntactic constituents as the domains for their application.\nTagmemics\nA model of linguistic analysis developed by Kenneth Pike,\nwhich takes the tagmeme as the basic unity of grammatical\ndescription, a tagmeme being defined as the correlation of\na grammatical slot and the class of words by which it can\nbe filled.\nTopicalisation\nThe movement of a constituent to the left (initial) edge\nof the sentence (see also extraposition and contrast left\ndislocation).\nTheme/Rheme\nAlternate names for Topic and Comment, respectively.

Cambridge Semitic\nLanguages and Cultures\nGeneral Editor Geoffrey Khan Cambridge Semitic Languages and Cultures\nAbout the series\nThis series is published by Open Book Publishers in collaboration with the\nFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies of the University of Cambridge.\nThe aim of the series is to publish in open-access form monographs in the\nfi eld of Semitic languages and the cultures associated with speakers of Semitic\nlanguages. It is hoped that this will help disseminate research in this fi eld to\nacademic researchers around the world and also open up this research to\nthe communities whose languages and cultures the volumes concern. This\nseries includes philological and linguistic studies of Semitic languages and\neditions of Semitic texts. Titles in the series will cover all periods, traditions\nand methodological approaches to the fi eld. The editorial board comprises\nGeoffrey Khan, Aaron Hornkohl, and Esther-Miriam Wagner.\nThis is the fi rst Open Access book series in the fi eld; it combines the high\npeer-review and editorial standards with the fair Open Access model offered\nby OBP. Open Access (that is, making texts free to read and reuse) helps spread\nresearch results and other educational materials to everyone everywhere, not\njust to those who can afford it or have access to well-endowed university\nlibraries.\nCopyrights stay where they belong, with the authors. Authors are encouraged\nto secure funding to offset the publication costs and thereby sustain the\npublishing model, but if no institutional funding is available, authors are not\ncharged for publication. Any grant secured covers the actual costs of publishing\nand is not taken as profi t. In short: we support publishing that respects the\nauthors and serves the public interest.\nThis book was copyedited by Anne Burberry.\nOther titles of the series\nAn Introduction to Andalusi Hebrew Metrics\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Delgado\ndoi.org/10.11647/OBP.0351\nThe Linguistic Classifi cation of the Reading Traditions of Biblical\nHebrew: A Phyla-and-Waves Model\nBenjamin Paul Kantor\ndoi.org/10.11647/OBP.0210\nMore information and a complete list of books in this series can be found at:\nhttps://www.openbookpublishers.com/series/2632-6914 "
