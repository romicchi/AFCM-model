It is intended for a typical 1000-level uni-\nversity introductory course in the Geosciences, although its contents could be applied to many other related courses.The\ntextbook is an amalgamation of existing open-source textbooks (An Introduction to Geology from Salt Lake Community\nCollege, Physical Geology from BCcampus, and Astronomy by OpenStax). It has been customized to match the Pathways\nGeneral Education Curriculum at Virginia Tech with a focus on Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) of Pathways Concept 4:\nReasoning in the Natural Sciences.\nThe sequence of chapters in this book may differ from a typical commercial publisher\u2019s introductory Earth Science text-\nbook. Selected concepts in the book have been reorganized to summarize elementary or foundation topics prior to dis-\ncussion of more complex topics in Earth Science. A foundational knowledge of minerals and rocks is essential in an\nintroductory Earth Science course. Oftentimes all three rock classifications are bundled into a single \u201crocks\u201d chapter but\nbecause they vary extensively in the way they form and their overall features, this textbook gives the three major rock types\ntheir own dedicated chapter. A similar issue occurs with mass wasting which is usually included as a small section within\nan overall \u201cwater\u201d chapter but in the geosciences, mass wasting is an important surficial process that moves material across\nthe surface of Earth. Therefore, mass wasting is dedicated to a single chapter. Geologic time is commonly paired with Earth\nhistory but both topics are uniquely important in a foundational knowledge of Earth and as such, each topic has its own\nchapter.\nThis textbook includes a chapter dedicated to the origin of the universe and our solar system. Many existing introductory\nEarth Science books lack a chapter dedicated to astronomy and the solar system. Understanding our solar system is impor-\ntant for a variety of reasons: it contains the only known example of a habitable planet, the only star observable close-up,\nand the only planets we can visit with modern technology such as satellites, probes, and landers. Knowledge of Earth\u2019s\nplace within the solar system is essential to understand the origin of planets, along with the conditions that allow life to\nexist on Earth.\nThis open-source textbook includes various important features designed to enhance the student learning experience in\nintroductory Earth Science courses. These include a multitude of high-quality figures and images within each chapter that\nhelp to clarify key concepts and are optimized for viewing online. Self-test assessment questions are embedded in each\nonline chapter that help students focus their learning. QR codes are provided for each assessment to allow students using\nprint or PDF versions to easily access the quiz from an internet-capable device of their choice. Selected graphics and tables\nhave been replaced or updated to enhance quality and clarity.\nFeatures of this book\n\u2022 Example-rich narrative\n\u2022 Graphic elements which illustrate and reinforce concepts\n\u2022 Linked online glossary (glossary appears at the end for PDF)\n\u2022 Embedded navigation and image alt-text for screen readers\n\u2022 QR Online interactive self-test quiz questions\n\u2022 Free online and in PDF, and in-print at vendor cost of production\n\u2022 Open license, Creative Commons BY NC-SA 4.0 permits customization and sharing\n\u2022 Instructor community portal enables sharing of ancillary resources\n\u2022 Register your Use form allows instructors to opt in to receive book updates\n\u2022 Errata and report-an-error/share-a-suggestion forms promote currency ABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAdapted by\nLaura Neser, Ph.D., is an Instructor in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech. Dr. Neser earned her B.S. in Geo-\nsciences at Virginia Tech in the spring of 2008 and completed her Ph.D. in Geological Sciences At the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) in 2014.

Science is more than just a body of knowledge, science provides a\nmeans to evaluate and create new knowledge without bias. Scientists use objective\nevidence over subjective evidence, to reach sound and logical conclusions.\nAn objective observation is without personal bias and the same by all individuals.\nHumans are biased by nature, so they cannot be completely objective; the goal is to\nbe as unbiased as possible. A subjective observation is based on a person\u2019s feelings\nand beliefs and is unique to that individual.\nAnother way scientists avoid bias is by using quantitative over qualitative measure-\nments whenever possible. A quantitative measurement is expressed with a specific\nnumerical value. Qualitative observations are general or relative descriptions. For\nexample, describing a rock as red or heavy is a qualitative observation. Determining\na rock\u2019s color by measuring wavelengths of reflected light or its density by measuring\nthe proportions of minerals it contains is quantitative. Numerical values are more pre-\nFigure 1.1: This is Grand Canyon of the\nYellowstone in Yellowstone National cise than general descriptions, and they can be analyzed using statistical calculations.\nPark.

Only after exhaustively eliminating false results,\ncompeting ideas, and possible variations does a hypothesis\nbecome regarded as a reliable scientific theory. This meticulous\nscrutiny reveals weaknesses or flaws in a hypothesis and is the\nstrength that supports all scientific ideas and procedures. In fact,\nproving current ideas are wrong has been the driving force behind\nmany scientific careers.\nFalsifiability separates science from pseudoscience. Scientists are\nFigure 1.2: Canyons like this, carved in the deposit left by the\nwary of explanations of natural phenomena that discourage or avoid\nMay 18th, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens is sometimes used\nfalsifiability. An explanation that cannot be tested or does not meet by purveyors of pseudoscience as evidence for the Earth\nscientific standards is not considered science, but pseudoscience. being very young. In reality, the unconsolidated and\nunlithified volcanic deposit is carved much more easily than\nPseudoscience is a collection of ideas that may appear scientific but\nother canyons like the Grand Canyon.\ndoes not use the scientific method. Astrology is an example of\npseudoscience. It is a belief system that attributes the movement of celestial bodies to influencing human behavior.\nAstrologers rely on celestial observations, but their conclusions are not based on experimental evidence and their state-\nments are not falsifiable. This is not to be confused with astronomy which is the scientific study of celestial bodies and the\ncosmos.\nScience is also a social process. Scientists share their ideas with\npeers at conferences, seeking guidance and feedback. Research\npapers and data submitted for publication are rigorously reviewed\nby qualified peers, scientists who are experts in the same field.\nThe scientific review process aims to weed out misinformation,\ninvalid research results, and wild speculation. Thus, it is slow, cau-\ntious, and conservative. Scientists tend to wait until a hypothesis\nis supported by overwhelming amount of evidence from many\nindependent researchers before accepting it as scientific theory.\nFigure 1.3: Geologists share information by publishing, attending\nconferences, and even going on field trips, such as this trip to\nthe Lake Owyhee Volcanic Field in Oregon by the Bureau of\nLand Management in 2019.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 1.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

At the\nforefront of the scientific method are conclusions based\non objective evidence, not opinion or hearsay.\nFigure 1.4: Diagram of the cyclical nature of the scientific method.\nStep One: Observation, Problem, or Research Question\nThe procedure begins with identifying a problem or research question, such as a geological phenomenon that is not well\nexplained in the scientific community\u2019s collective knowledge. This step usually involves reviewing the scientific literature to\nunderstand previous studies that may be related to the question.\nStep Two: Hypothesis\nOnce the problem or question is well defined, the scientist\nproposes a possible answer, a hypothesis, before conduct-\ning an experiment or field work. This hypothesis must be\nspecific, falsifiable, and should be based on other scientific\nwork. Geologists often develop multiple working hypothe-\nses because they usually cannot impose strict experimental\ncontrols or have limited opportunities to visit a field location.\nFigure 1.5: A famous hypothesis: Leland Stanford wanted to know if a\nhorse lifted all 4 legs off the ground during a gallop, since the legs are\ntoo fast for the human eye to perceive it. These series of photographs\nby Eadweard Muybridge proved the horse, in fact, does have all four\nlegs off the ground during the gallop. 4 | UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE\nStep Three: Experiment and Hypothesis Revision\nThe next step is developing an experiment that either supports or refutes the hypothesis.\nMany people mistakenly think experiments are only done in a lab; however, an experiment\ncan consist of observing natural processes in the field. Regardless of what form an experiment\ntakes, it always includes the systematic gathering of objective data. This data is interpreted to\ndetermine whether it contradicts or supports the hypothesis, which may be revised and tested\nagain. When a hypothesis holds up under experimentation, it is ready to be shared with other\nexperts in the field.\nStep Four: Peer Review, Publication, and Replication\nScientists share the results of their research by publishing articles in scientific journals, such as\nScience and Nature. Reputable journals and publishing houses will not publish an experimental\nstudy until they have determined its methods are scientifically rigorous and the conclusions\nFigure 1.6: An experiment at\nare supported by evidence. Before an article is published, it undergoes a rigorous peer review\nthe University of Queensland\nby scientific experts who scrutinize the methods, results, and discussion. Once an article is has been going since 1927. A\npetroleum product called\npublished, other scientists may attempt to replicate the results. This replication is necessary to\npitch, which is highly viscous,\nconfirm the reliability of the study\u2019s reported results. A hypothesis that seemed compelling in drips out of a funnel about\none study might be proven false in studies conducted by other scientists. New technology can once per decade.\nbe applied to published studies, which can aid in confirming or rejecting once-accepted ideas\nand/or hypotheses.\nStep Five: Theory Development\nIn casual conversation, the word theory implies guesswork or speculation. In the lan-\nguage of science, an explanation or conclusion made in a theory carries much more\nweight because it is supported by experimental verification and widely accepted by\nthe scientific community. After a hypothesis has been repeatedly tested for falsifia-\nbility through documented and independent studies, it eventually becomes\naccepted as a scientific theory.\nWhile a hypothesis provides a tentative explanation before an experiment, a theory\nis the best explanation after being confirmed by multiple independent experiments.\nConfirmation of a theory may take years, or even longer. For example, the continen-\ntal drift hypothesis first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912 was initially dismissed.\nAfter decades of additional evidence collection by other scientists using more\nadvanced technology, Wegener\u2019s hypothesis was accepted and revised as the the-\nory of plate tectonics.\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection is another example. Originating from the Figure 1.7: Wegener later in his life, ca.\n1924-1930.\nwork of Charles Darwin in the mid-19th century, the theory of evolution has with-\nstood generations of scientific testing for falsifiability. While it has been updated and revised to accommodate knowledge\ngained by using modern technologies, the theory of evolution continues to be supported by the latest evidence.

Athens was\ngoverned as a democracy, which encouraged individuals to think independently, at\na time when most civilizations were ruled by monarchies or military conquerors.\nForemost among the early philosopher/scientists to use empirical thinking was\nAristotle, born in 384 BCE. Empiricism emphasizes the value of evidence gained\nfrom experimentation and observation. Aristotle studied under Plato and tutored\nAlexander the Great. Alexander would later conquer the Persian Empire, and in the\nprocess spread Greek culture as far east as India.\nAristotle applied an empirical method of analysis called deductive reasoning,\nwhich applies known principles of thought to establish new ideas or predict new\noutcomes. Deductive reasoning starts with generalized principles and logically\nextends them to new ideas or specific conclusions. If the initial principle is valid,\nthen it is highly likely the conclusion is also valid. An example of deductive reason-\ning is if A=B, and B=C, then A=C. Another example is if all birds have feathers, and a\nsparrow is a bird, then a sparrow must also have feathers. The problem with deduc-\nFigure 1.8: Fresco by Raphael of Plato (left) tive reasoning is if the initial principle is flawed, the conclusion will inherit that flaw.\nand Aristotle (right).\nHere is an example of a flawed initial principle leading to the wrong conclusion; if\nall animals that fly are birds, and bats also fly, then bats must also be birds.\nThis type of empirical thinking contrasts with inductive reasoning, which begins from new observations and attempts to\ndiscern underlying generalized principles. A conclusion made through inductive reasoning comes from analyzing mea-\nsurable evidence, rather making a logical connection. For example, to determine whether bats are birds a scientist might\nlist various characteristics observed in birds\u2013the presence of feathers, a toothless beak, hollow bones, lack of forelegs, and\nexternally laid eggs. Next, the scientist would check whether bats share the same characteristics, and if they do not, draw\nthe conclusion that bats are not birds.\nBoth types of reasoning are important in science because they emphasize the two most important aspects of science:\nobservation and inference. Scientists test existing principles to see if they accurately infer or predict their observations.\nThey also analyze new observations to determine if the inferred underlying principles still support them. 6 | UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE\nGreek culture was spread by Alexander and then absorbed by the Romans, who help further\nextend Greek knowledge into Europe through their vast infrastructure of roads, bridges, and\naqueducts. After the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 CE, scientific progress in Europe stalled.\nScientific thinkers of medieval time had such high regard for Aristotle\u2019s wisdom and knowl-\nedge they faithfully followed his logical approach to understanding nature for centuries. By\ncontrast, science in the Middle East flourished and grew between 800 and 1450 CE, along\nwith culture and the arts.\nNear the end of the medieval period, empirical experimentation became more common in\nEurope. During the Renaissance, which lasted from the 14th through 17th centuries, artistic\nand scientific thought experienced a great awakening. European scholars began to criticize\nthe traditional Aristotelian approach and by the end of the Renaissance period, empiricism\nwas poised to become a key component of the scientific revolution that would arise in the\n17th century.\nAn early example of how Renaissance scien- Figure 1.9: Drawing of Avicenna\n(Ibn Sina).

Ptolemy was a highly regarded mathematician,\nand his mathematical calculations were widely accepted by the scientific\ncommunity. The view of the cosmos with Earth at its center is called the\nFigure 1.10: Geocentric drawing by Bartolomeu geocentric model. This geocentric model persisted until the Renaissance\nVelho in 1568.\nperiod, when some revolutionary thinkers challenged the centuries-old\nhypothesis.\nBy contrast, early Renaissance scholars such as astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed an alternative\nexplanation for the perceived movement of the Sun, Moon, and stars. Sometime between 1507 and 1515, he provided cred-\nible mathematical proof for a radically new model of the cosmos, one in which the Earth and other planets orbited around\na centrally located Sun. After the invention of the telescope in 1608, scientists used their enhanced astronomical observa-\ntions to support this heliocentric, Sun-centered, model.\nTwo scientists, Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei, are credited with jump-\nstarting the scientific revolution. They accomplished this by building on Coper-\nnicus work and challenging long-established ideas about nature and science.\nJohannes Kepler (1571-1630) was a German mathematician and astronomer\nwho expanded on the heliocentric model\u2014improving Copernicus\u2019 original cal-\nculations and describing planetary motion as elliptical paths. Galileo Galilei\n(1564 \u2013 1642) was an Italian astronomer who used the newly developed tele-\nscope to observe the four largest moons of Jupiter. This was the first piece of\ndirect evidence to contradict the geocentric model, since moons orbiting\nJupiter could not also be orbiting Earth.\nFigure 1.12: Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric model. UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE | 7\nGalileo strongly supported the heliocentric model and attacked the geocentric model,\narguing for a more scientific approach to determine the credibility of an idea. Because of\nthis he found himself at odds with prevailing scientific views and the Catholic Church. In\n1633 he was found guilty of heresy and placed under house arrest, where he would\nremain until his death in 1642.\nGalileo is regarded as the first modern scientist because he conducted experiments that\nwould prove or disprove falsifiable ideas and based his conclusions on mathematical\nanalysis of quantifiable evidence\u2014a radical departure from the deductive thinking of\nGreek philosophers such as Aristotle. His methods marked the beginning of a major shift\nin how scientists studied the natural world, with an increasing number of them relying on\nevidence and experimentation to form their hypotheses. It was during this revolutionary\ntime that geologists such as James Hutton and Nicolas Steno also made great advances\nin their scientific fields of study.\nFigure 1.11: Galileo\u2019s first mention of\nmoons of Jupiter.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 1.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

One major contributor was Nicolaus Steno (1638-1686), a Danish\npriest who studied anatomy and geology. Steno was the first to propose the Earth\u2019s surface\ncould change over time. He suggested sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone and shale,\noriginally formed in horizontal layers with the oldest on the bottom and progressively\nyounger layers on top.\nIn the 18th century, Scottish naturalist James Hutton (1726\u20131797) studied rivers and coast-\nlines and compared the sediments they left behind to exposed sedimentary rock strata. He\nhypothesized the ancient rocks must have been formed by processes like those producing\nthe features in the oceans and streams. Hutton also proposed the Earth was much older\nthan previously thought. Modern geologic processes operate slowly. Hutton realized if these\nprocesses formed rocks, then the Earth must be very old, possibly hundreds of millions of\nyears old.\nHutton\u2019s idea is called the principle of uniformitarianism and states that natural processes\nFigure 1.13: Illustration by Steno\noperate the same now as in the past, i.e. the laws of nature are uniform across space and showing a comparison between\ntime. Geologist often state \u201cthe present is the key to the past,\u201d meaning they can understand fossil and modern shark teeth.\nancient rocks by studying modern geologic processes.\nPrior to the acceptance of uniformitarianism, scientists such as German\ngeologist Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817) and French anatomist\nGeorges Cuvier (1769-1832) thought rocks and landforms were formed by\ngreat catastrophic events. Cuvier championed this view, known as cata-\nstrophism, and stated, \u201cThe thread of operation is broken; nature has\nchanged course, and none of the agents she employs today would have\nbeen sufficient to produce her former works.\u201d He meant processes that\noperate today did not operate in the past. Known as the father of verte-\nbrate paleontology, Cuvier made significant contributions to the study of\nancient life and taught at Paris\u2019s Museum of Natural History. Based on his\nstudy of large vertebrate fossils, he was the first to suggest species could\nFigure 1.14: Cuvier\u2019s comparison of modern elephant\ngo extinct. However, he thought new species were introduced by special\nand mammoth jaw bones.\ncreation after catastrophic floods.\nHutton\u2019s ideas about uniformitarianism and Earth\u2019s age were not\nwell received by the scientific community of his time. His ideas\nwere falling into obscurity when Charles Lyell, a British lawyer and\ngeologist (1797-1875), wrote the Principles of Geology in the early\n1830s and later, Elements of Geology. Lyell\u2019s books promoted Hut-\nton\u2019s principle of uniformitarianism, his studies of rocks and the\nprocesses that formed them, and the idea that Earth was possibly\nover 300 million years old. Lyell and his three-volume Principles of\nGeology had a lasting influence on the geologic community and\npublic at large, who eventually accepted uniformitarianism and\nmillionfold age for the Earth. The principle of uniformitarianism\nFigure 1.15: Inside cover of Lyell\u2019s Elements of Geology.\nbecame so widely accepted, that geologists regarded cata-\nstrophic change as heresy. This made it harder for ideas like the sudden demise of the dinosaurs by asteroid impact to gain\ntraction. UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE | 9\nA contemporary of Lyell, Charles Darwin (1809-1882) took Principles of Geology on his five-year trip on the HMS Beagle.\nDarwin used uniformitarianism and deep geologic time to develop his initial ideas about evolution. Lyell was one of the\nfirst to publish a reference to Darwin\u2019s idea of evolution.\nThe next big advancement, and perhaps the largest in the history of geology, is the\ntheory of plate tectonics and continental drift. Dogmatic acceptance of uniformitar-\nianism inhibited the progress of this idea, mainly because of the permanency placed\non the continents and their positions. Ironically, slow and steady movement of plates\nwould fit well into a uniformitarianism model. However, much time passed and a great\ndeal of scientific resistance had to be overcome before the idea took hold. This hap-\npened for several reasons. Firstly, the movement was so slow it was overlooked. Sec-\nondly, the best evidence was hidden under the ocean. Finally, the accepted theories\nwere anchored by a large amount of inertia. Instead of being bias free, scientists\nresisted and ridiculed the emerging idea of plate tectonics. This example of dog-\nmatic thinking is still to this day a tarnish on the geoscience community.\nPlate tectonics is most commonly attributed to Alfred Wegener, the first scientist to\ncompile a large data set supporting the idea of continents shifting places over time.\nFigure 1.16: J. Tuzo Wilson.\nHe was mostly ignored and ridiculed for his ideas, but later workers like Marie Tharp,\nBruce Heezen, Harry Hess, Laurence Morley, Frederick Vine, Drummond Matthews, Kiyoo Wadati, Hugo Benioff, Robert\nCoats, and J. Tuzo Wilson benefited from advances in sub-sea technologies. They discovered, described, and analyzed\nnew features like the mid-ocean ridge, alignment of earthquakes, and magnetic striping. Gradually these scientists intro-\nduced a paradigm shift that revolutionized geology into the science we know today.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 1.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Geology plays an important role in soci-\nety; its principles are essential to locating, extracting, and manag-\ning natural resources; evaluating environmental impacts of using\nor extracting these resources; as well as understanding and miti-\ngating the effects of natural hazards.\nGeology often applies information from physics and chemistry to\nthe natural world, like understanding the physical forces in a land-\nslide or the chemical interaction between water and rocks. The\nterm comes from the Greek word geo, meaning Earth, and logos,\nmeaning to think or reckon with.\n1.5.1 Why Study Geology? Figure 1.17: Girls into Geoscience inaugural Irish Fieldtrip.\nGeology plays a key role in how we use natural resources\u2014any\nnaturally occurring material that can be extracted from the Earth for\neconomic gain. Our developed modern society, like all societies\nbefore it, is dependent on geologic resources. Geologists are\ninvolved in extracting fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum;\nmetals such as copper, aluminum, and iron; and water resources in\nstreams and underground reservoirs inside soil and rocks. They\ncan help conserve our planet\u2019s finite supply of nonrenewable\nresources, like petroleum, which are fixed in quantity and depleted\nby consumption. Geologists can also help manage renewable\nresources that can be replaced or regenerated, such as solar or\nwind energy, and timber.\nFigure 1.18: Hoover Dam provides hydroelectric energy and\nstores water for southern Nevada.\nResource extraction and usage impacts our environment, which\ncan negatively affect human health. For example, burning fossil\nfuels releases chemicals into the air that are unhealthy for\nhumans, especially children. Mining activities can release toxic\nheavy metals, such as lead and mercury, into the soil and water-\nways. Our choices will have an effect on Earth\u2019s environment for\nthe foreseeable future. Understanding the remaining quantity,\nextractability, and renewability of geologic resources will help us\nbetter sustainably manage those resources.\nFigure 1.19: Coal power plant in Helper, Utah. UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE | 11\nGeologists also study natural hazards created by geologic\nprocesses. Natural hazards are phenomena that are potentially dan-\ngerous to human life or property. No place on Earth is completely\nfree of natural hazards, so one of the best ways people can protect\nthemselves is by understanding geology. Geology can teach peo-\nple about the natural hazards in an area and how to prepare for\nthem. Geologic hazards include landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis,\nfloods, volcanic eruptions, and sea-level rise.\nFinally, geology is where other scientific disciplines intersect in the\nconcept known as Earth System Science. In science, a system is a\nFigure 1.20: Buildings toppled from liquefaction during a 7.5\ngroup of interactive objects and processes. Earth System Science\nmagnitude earthquake in Japan.\nviews the entire planet as a combination of systems that interact\nwith each other via complex relationships. This geology textbook provides an introduction to science in general and will\noften reference other scientific disciplines.\nEarth System Science includes five basic systems (or spheres), the\nGeosphere (the solid body of the Earth), the Atmosphere (the gas\nenvelope surrounding the Earth), the Hydrosphere (water in all its\nforms at and near the surface of the Earth), the Cryosphere (frozen\nwater part of Earth), and the Biosphere (life on Earth in all its forms and\ninteractions, including humankind).\nRather than viewing geology as an isolated system, earth system sci-\nentists study how geologic processes shape not only the world, but all\nthe spheres it contains. They study how these multidisciplinary\nspheres relate, interact, and change in response to natural cycles and\nFigure 1.21: Oregon\u2019s Crater Lake was formed about 7700\nhuman-driven forces. They use elements from physics, chemistry,\nyears ago after the eruption of Mount Mazama.\nbiology, meteorology, environmental science, zoology, hydrology, and\nmany other sciences.\n1.5.2 Rock Cycle\nThe most fundamental view of Earth materials is the rock cycle, which\ndescribes the major materials that comprise the Earth, the processes\nthat form them, and how they relate to each other. It usually begins\nwith hot molten liquid rock called magma or lava. Magma forms\nunder the Earth\u2019s surface in the crust or mantle. Lava is molten rock\nthat erupts onto the Earth\u2019s surface. When magma or lava cools, it\nsolidifies by a process called crystallization in which minerals grow\nwithin the magma or lava. The rocks resulting rocks are igneous\nrocks. Ignis is Latin for fire.\nIgneous rocks, as well as other types of rocks, on Earth\u2019s surface are\nexposed to weathering and erosion, which produces sediments.\nWeathering is the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks into\nsmaller fragments. Erosion is the removal of those fragments from\ntheir original location. The broken-down and transported fragments or\nFigure 1.22: Rock cycle showing the five materials (such as\ngrains are considered sediments, such as gravel, sand, silt, and clay. igneous rocks and sediment) and the processes by which\none changes into another (such as weathering).\nThese sediments may be transported by streams and rivers, ocean\ncurrents, glaciers, and wind. 12 | UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE\nSediments come to rest in a process known as deposition. As the deposited\nsediments accumulate\u2014often under water, such as in a shallow marine\nenvironment\u2014the older sediments get buried by the new deposits. The\ndeposits are compacted by the weight of the overlying sediments and indi-\nvidual grains are cemented together by minerals in groundwater. These\nprocesses of compaction and cementation are called lithification. Lithified\nsediments are considered a sedimentary rock, such as sandstone and\nshale. Other sedimentary rocks are made by direct chemical precipitation of\nminerals rather than eroded sediments, and are known as chemical sedi-\nmentary rocks.\nFigure 1.23: Mississippian raindrop impressions\nover wave ripples from Nova Scotia.\nPre-existing rocks\nmay be transformed\ninto a metamorphic rock; meta- means change and -morphos\nmeans form or shape. When rocks are subjected to extreme\nincreases in temperature or pressure, the mineral crystals are\nenlarged or altered into entirely new minerals with similar chemi-\ncal make up. High temperatures and pressures occur in rocks\nburied deep within the Earth\u2019s crust or that come into contact with\nhot magma or lava. If the temperature and pressure conditions\nmelt the rocks to create magma and lava, the rock cycle begins\nanew with the creation of new rocks.\n1.5.3 Plate Tectonics and Layers of Earth\nFigure 1.24: Metamorphic rock in Georgian Bay, Ontario.\nThe theory of plate tectonics is the fundamental unifying principle\nof geology and the rock cycle. Plate tectonics describes how\nEarth\u2019s layers move relative to each other, focusing on the tectonic\nor lithospheric plates of the outer layer. Tectonic plates float, col-\nlide, slide past each other, and split apart on an underlying mobile\nlayer called the asthenosphere. Major landforms are created at the\nplate boundaries, and rocks within the tectonic plates move\nthrough the rock cycle. Plate tectonics is discussed in more detail\nin chapter 2.\nFigure 1.25: Map of the major plates and their motions along\nboundaries.\nEarth\u2019s three main geological layers can be categorized by\nchemical composition or the chemical makeup: crust,\nmantle, and core. The crust is the outermost layer and\ncomposed of mostly silicon, oxygen, aluminum, iron, and\nmagnesium. There are two types, continental crust and\noceanic crust. Continental crust is about 50 km (30 mi)\nthick, composed of low-density igneous and sedimentary Figure 1.26: The global map of the depth of the moho.\nrocks, Oceanic crust is approximately 10 km (6 mi) thick\nand made of high-density igneous basalt-type rocks. Oceanic crust makes up most of the ocean floor, covering about\n70% of the planet. Tectonic plates are made of crust and a portion the upper mantle, forming a rigid physical layer called\nthe lithosphere. UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE | 13\nThe mantle, the largest chemical layer by volume, lies below the\ncrust and extends down to about 2,900 km (1,800 mi) below the\nEarth\u2019s surface. The mostly solid mantle is made of peridotite, a\nhigh-density composed of silica, iron, and magnesium. The upper\npart of mantel is very hot and flexible, which allows the overlying\ntectonic plates to float and move about on it. Under the mantle is\nthe Earth\u2019s core, which is 3,500 km (2,200 mi) thick and made of iron\nand nickel. The core consists of two parts, a liquid outer core and\nsolid inner core. Rotations within the solid and liquid metallic core\ngenerate Earth\u2019s magnetic field (see figure 1.27).\nFigure 1.27: The layers of the Earth. Physical layers include\nlithosphere and asthenosphere; chemical layers are crust,\nmantle, and core.\n1.5.4 Geologic Time and Deep Time\nFigure 1.28: Geologic time on Earth, represented circularly, to show the individual time divisions and important events. Ga=billion years\nago, Ma=million years ago. 14 | UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE\n\u201cThe result, therefore, of our present enquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning; no prospect of an end.\u201d (James Hutton,\n1788)\nOne of the early pioneers of geology, James Hutton, wrote this about the age of the Earth after many years of geological\nstudy. Although he wasn\u2019t exactly correct\u2014there is a beginning and will be an end to planet Earth\u2014Hutton was expressing\nthe difficulty humans have in perceiving the vastness of geological time. Hutton did not assign an age to the Earth, although\nhe was the first to suggest the planet was very old.\nToday we know Earth is approximately 4.54 \u00b1 0.05 billion years old. This age was first calculated by Caltech professor Clair\nPatterson in 1956, who measured the half-lives of lead isotopes to radiometrically date a meteorite recovered in Arizona.\nStudying geologic time, also known as deep time, can help us overcome a perspective of Earth that is limited to our short\nlifetimes. Compared to the geologic scale, the human lifespan is very short, and we struggle to comprehend the depth\nof geologic time and slowness of geologic processes. For example, the study of earthquakes only goes back about 100\nyears; however, there is geologic evidence of large earthquakes occurring thousands of years ago. And scientific evidence\nindicates earthquakes will continue for many centuries into the future.\nEons are the largest divisions of time, and from oldest to youngest are\nnamed Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. The three old-\nest eons are sometimes collectively referred to as Precambrian time.\nLife first appeared more than 3,800 million of years ago (Ma). From 3,500\nMa to 542 Ma, or 88% of geologic time, the predominant life forms were\nsingle-celled organisms such as bacteria. More complex organisms\nappeared only more recently, during the current Phanerozoic Eon,\nwhich includes the last 542 million years or 12% of geologic time.\nThe name Phanerozoic comes from phaneros, which means visible, and\nzoic, meaning life. This eon marks the proliferation of multicellular ani-\nmals with hard body parts, such as shells, which are preserved in the\ngeological record as fossils. Land-dwelling animals have existed for 360\nmillion years, or 8% of geologic time. The demise of the dinosaurs and\nsubsequent rise of mammals occurred around 65 Ma, or 1.5% of geologic\ntime. Our human ancestors belonging to the genus Homo have existed\nsince approximately 2.2 Ma\u20140.05% of geological time or just 1/2,000th\nthe total age of Earth.\nThe Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three eras: Paleozoic, Mesozoic,\nand Cenozoic. Paleozoic means ancient life, and organisms of this era\nincluded invertebrate animals, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. The Meso-\nzoic (middle life) is popularly known as the Age of Reptiles and is charac-\nterized by the abundance of dinosaurs, many of which evolved into birds.\nThe mass extinction of the dinosaurs and other apex predator reptiles\nmarked the end of the Mesozoic and beginning of the Cenozoic. Ceno-\nzoic means new life and is also called the Age of Mammals, during which\nmammals evolved to become the predominant land-dwelling animals.\nFossils of early humans, or hominids, appear in the rock record only dur-\ning the last few million years of the Cenozoic. The geologic time scale,\nFigure 1.29: Geologic time scale showing time period\nnames and ages. geologic time, and geologic history are discussed in more detail in chap-\nter 7 and chapter 8. UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE | 15\n1.5.5 The Geologist\u2019s Tools\nIn its simplest form, a geologist\u2019s tool may be a rock hammer used for sampling a\nfresh surface of a rock. A basic tool set for fieldwork might also include:\n\u2022 Magnifying lens for looking at mineralogical details\n\u2022 Compass for measuring the orientation of geologic features\n\u2022 Map for documenting the local distribution of rocks and minerals\n\u2022 Magnet for identifying magnetic minerals like magnetite\n\u2022 Dilute solution of hydrochloric acid to identify carbonate-containing minerals\nlike calcite or limestone.\nIn the laboratory, geologists use optical microscopes to closely examine rocks and\nsoil for mineral composition and grain size. Laser and mass spectrometers precisely\nmeasure the chemical composition and geological age of minerals. Seismographs\nrecord and locate earthquake activity, or when used in conjunction with ground pen-\netrating radar, locate objects buried beneath the surface of the earth. Scientists apply\ncomputer simulations to turn their collected data into testable, theoretical models.\nFigure 1.30: Iconic Archaeopteryx\nHydrogeologists drill wells to sample and analyze underground water quality and lithographica fossil from Germany.\navailability. Geochemists use scanning electron microscopes to analyze minerals at\nthe atomic level, via x-rays. Other geologists use gas chromatography to analyze liquids and gases trapped in glacial ice\nor rocks.\nTechnology provides new tools for scientific observation, which leads to new evidence that helps scientists revise and\neven refute old ideas. Because the ultimate technology will never be discovered, the ultimate observation will never be\nmade.

This makes\nit easier for students to understand the complex material.\nAdvanced students will encounter more controversies as\nthey continue to study their discipline.\nSome groups of people argue that some established sci-\nentific theories are wrong, not based on their scientific\nmerit but rather on the ideology of the group. This section\nfocuses on how to identify evidence based information and\ndifferentiate it from pseudoscience.\n1.6.1 Science Denial\nFigure 1.31: Anti-evolution league at the infamous Tennessee v. Scopes\ntrial.\nScience denial happens when people argue that established sci-\nentific theories are wrong, not based on scientific merit but rather\non subjective ideology\u2014such as for social, political, or economic\nreasons. Organizations and people use science denial as a\nrhetorical argument against issues or ideas they oppose. Three\nexamples of science denial versus science are: 1) teaching evo-\nlution in public schools, 2) linking tobacco smoke to cancer, and 3)\nlinking human activity to climate change. Among these, denial of\nclimate change is strongly connected with geology. A climate\ndenier specifically denies or doubts the objective conclusions of\ngeologists and climate scientists.\nFigure 1.32: 2017 March for Science in Washington, DC. This and\nother similar marches were in response to funding cuts and\nanti-science rhetoric. UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE | 17\nScience denial generally uses three false arguments. The first argument tries\nto undermine the credibility of the scientific conclusion by claiming the research\nmethods are flawed or the theory is not universally accepted\u2014the science is\nunsettled. The notion that scientific ideas are not absolute creates doubt for\nnon-scientists; however, a lack of universal truths should not be confused with\nscientific uncertainty. Because science is based on falsfiabiity, scientists avoid\nclaiming universal truths and use language that conveys uncertainty. This\nallows scientific ideas to change and evolve as more evidence is uncovered.\nThe second argument claims the researchers are not objective and motivated\nby an ideology or economic agenda. This is an ad hominem argument in which\na person\u2019s character is attacked instead of the merit of their argument. They\nclaim results have been manipulated so researchers can justify asking for more\nfunding. They claim that because the researchers are funded by a federal grant,\nthey are using their results to lobby for expanded government regulation.\nFigure 1.33: Three false rhetorical arguments of\nThe third argument is to demand a balanced view, equal time in media cover- science denial.\nage and educational curricula, to engender the false illusion of two equally valid\narguments. Science deniers frequently demand equal coverage of their proposals, even when there is little scientific evi-\ndence supporting their ideology. For example, science deniers might demand religious explanations be taught as an alter-\nnative to the well-established theory of evolution. Or that all possible causes of climate change be discussed as equally\nprobable, regardless of the body of evidence. Conclusions derived using the scientific method should not be confused\nwith those based on ideologies.\nFurthermore, conclusions about nature derived from ideologies have no place in science research and education. For\nexample, it would be inappropriate to teach the flat Earth model in a modern geology course because this idea has been\ndisproved by the scientific method. The formation of new conclusions based on the scientific method is the only way to\nchange scientific conclusions. The fact that scientists avoid universal truths and change their ideas as more evidence is\nuncovered shouldn\u2019t be seen as meaning that the science is unsettled. Unfortunately, widespread scientific illiteracy allows\nthese arguments to be used to suppress scientific knowledge and spread misinformation.\nIn a classic case of science denial, beginning in the 1960s and\nfor the next three decades, the tobacco industry and their sci-\nentists used rhetorical arguments to deny a connection\nbetween tobacco usage and cancer. Once it became clear\nscientific studies overwhelmingly found that using tobacco\ndramatically increased a person\u2019s likelihood of getting cancer,\ntheir next strategy was to create a sense of doubt about on the\nscience. The tobacco industry suggested the results were not\nyet fully understood and more study was needed. They used\nthis doubt to lobby for delaying legislative action that would\nwarn consumers of the potential health hazards. This same\ntactic is currently being employed by those who deny the sig-\nnificance of human involvement in climate change.\nFigure 1.34: The lag time between cancer after smoking, plus the\nethics of running human trials, delayed the government in taking\naction against tobacco. 18 | UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE\n1.6.2 Evaluating Sources of Information\nIn the age of the internet, information is plentiful. Geolo-\ngists, scientists, or anyone exploring scientific inquiry must\ndiscern valid sources of information from pseudoscience\nand misinformation. This evaluation is especially important\nin scientific research because scientific knowledge is\nrespected for its reliability. Textbooks such as this one can\naid this complex and crucial task. At its roots, quality infor-\nmation comes from the scientific method, beginning with\nthe empirical thinking of Aristotle. The application of the\nscientific method helps produce unbiased results. A valid\ninference or interpretation is based on objective evidence\nor data. Credible data and inferences are clearly labeled,\nseparated, and differentiated. Anyone looking over the data\ncan understand how the author\u2019s conclusion was derived\nor come to an alternative conclusion. Scientific procedures\nFigure 1.35: This graph shows earthquake data. To call this data are clearly defined so the investigation can be replicated to\ninduced, due to fracking, would be an interpretation.\nconfirm the original results or expanded further to produce\nnew results. These measures make a scientific inquiry valid\nand its use as a source reputable. Of course, substandard work occasionally slips through and retractions are published\nfrom time to time. An infamous article linking the MMR vaccine to autism appeared in the highly reputable journal Lancet in\n1998. Journalists discovered the author had multiple conflicts of interest and fabricated data, and the article was retracted\nin 2010.\nIn addition to methodology, data, and results, the authors of a study should be investi-\ngated. When looking into any research, the author(s) should be investigated. An\nauthor\u2019s credibility is based on multiple factors, such as having a degree in a relevant\ntopic or being funded from an unbiased source.\nThe same rigor should be applied to evaluating the publisher, ensuring the results\nreported come from an unbiased process. The publisher should be easy to discover.\nGood publishers will show the latest papers in the journal and make their contact infor-\nmation and identification clear. Reputable journals show their peer review style. Some\njournal are predatory, where they use unexplained and unnecessary fees to submit\nand access journals. Reputable journals have recognizable editorial boards. Often, a\nreliable journal will associate with a trade, association, or recognized open source ini-\nFigure 1.36: Logo for The Geological\ntiative.\nSociety of America, one of the leading\ngeoscience organizations.

This allows reproduction of\nexperimental results, corrections of errors, and proper justification of the research to experts.\nCitation is not only imperative to avoid plagiarism, but also allows readers to investigate an author\u2019s line of thought and\nconclusions. When reading scientific works, it is important to confirm the citations are from reputable scientific research.\nMost often, scientific citations are used to reference paraphrasing rather than quotes.

Science is never finished because a full truth can never be known.\nHowever, science and the scientific method are the best way to understand the universe we live in. Scientists draw con-\nclusions based on objective evidence; they consolidate these conclusions into unifying models. Geologists likewise under-\nstand studying the Earth is an ongoing process, beginning with James Hutton who declared the Earth has \u201c\u2026no vestige of a\nbeginning, no prospect of an end.\u201d Geologists explore the 4.5 billion-year history of Earth, its resources, and its many haz-\nards. From a larger viewpoint, geology can teach people how to develop credible conclusions, as well as identify and stop\nmisinformation.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Several of these idea revolutions forced\nscientists to re-examine their entire field, triggering a paradigm shift that shook up their conventionally held knowledge.\nCharles Darwin\u2019s book on evolution, On the Origin of Species, published in 1859; Gregor Mendel\u2019s discovery of the genetic PLATE TECTONICS | 25\nprinciples of inheritance in 1866; and James Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin\u2019s model for the structure of DNA\nin 1953 did that for biology. Albert Einstein\u2019s relativity and quantum mechanics concepts in the early twentieth century did\nthe same for Newtonian physics.\nThe concept of plate tectonics was just as revolutionary for geology. The theory of plate tectonics attributes the move-\nment of massive sections of the Earth\u2019s outer layers with creating earthquakes, mountains, and volcanoes. Many earth\nprocesses make more sense when viewed through the lens of plate tectonics. Because it is so important in understanding\nhow the world works, plate tectonics is the first topic of discussion in this textbook.\n2.1 Alfred Wegener\u2019s Continental Drift Hypothesis\nAlfred Wegener (1880-1930) was a German scientist who specialized in meteorology and cli-\nmatology. His knack for questioning accepted ideas started in 1910 when he disagreed with\nthe explanation that the Bering Land Bridge was formed by isostasy, and that similar land\nbridges once connected the continents. After reviewing the scientific literature, he published\na hypothesis stating the continents were originally connected, and then drifted apart. While\nhe did not have the precise mechanism worked out, his hypothesis was backed up by a long\nlist of evidence.\n2.1.1 Early Evidence for Continental Drift Hypothesis\nWegener\u2019s first piece of evidence was\nthat the coastlines of some continents Figure 2.2: Wegener later in his\nfit together like pieces of a jigsaw life, ca. 1924-1930.\npuzzle. People noticed the similarities\nin the coastlines of South America and Africa on the first world maps,\nand some suggested the continents had been ripped apart. Antonio\nSnider-Pellegrini did preliminary work on continental separation\nand matching fossils in 1858.\nFigure 2.3: Snider-Pellegrini\u2019s map showing the continental\nfit and separation, 1858.\nFigure 2.4: Map of world elevations. Note the light blue, which are continental shelves flooded by shallow ocean\nwater. These show the true shapes of the continents. 26 | PLATE TECTONICS\nWhat Wegener did differently was synthesize a large amount of data in one place. He used true edges of the continents,\nbased on the shapes of the continental shelves. This resulted in a better fit than previous efforts that traced the existing\ncoastlines.\nWegener also compiled evidence by comparing similar rocks, moun-\ntains, fossils, and glacial formations across oceans. For example, the\nfossils of the primitive aquatic reptile Mesosaurus were found on the\nseparate coastlines of Africa and South America. Fossils of another\nreptile, Lystrosaurus, were found on Africa, India, and Antarctica. He\npointed out these were land-dwelling creatures could not have\nswum across an entire ocean.\nOpponents of continental drift insisted trans-oceanic land bridges\nallowed animals and plants to move between continents. The land\nbridges eventually eroded away, leaving the continents permanently\nseparated. The problem with this hypothesis is the improbability of a\nland bridge being tall and long enough to stretch across a broad,\nFigure 2.5: Image showing fossils that connect the\ncontinents of Gondwana (the southern continents of deep ocean.\nPangea).\nMore support for continental drift came from the puzzling evidence\nthat glaciers once existed in normally very warm areas in southern Africa, India, Australia, and Arabia. These climate\nanomalies could not be explained by land bridges. Wegener found similar evidence when he discovered tropical plant\nfossils in the frozen region of the Arctic Circle. As Wegener collected more data, he realized the explanation that best fit all\nthe climate, rock, and fossil observations involved moving continents.\n2.1.2 Proposed Mechanism for Continental Drift\nWegener\u2019s work was considered a fringe science theory for his entire\nlife. One of the biggest flaws in his hypothesis was an inability to pro-\nvide a mechanism for how the continents moved. Obviously, the conti-\nnents did not appear to move, and changing the conservative minds of\nthe scientific community would require exceptional evidence that sup-\nported a credible mechanism. Other pro-continental drift followers\nused expansion, contraction, or even the moon\u2019s origin to explain how\nthe continents moved. Wegener used centrifugal forces and preces-\nsion, but this model was proven wrong. He also speculated about\nseafloor spreading, with hints of convection, but could not substanti-\nate these proposals. As it turns out, current scientific knowledge\nFigure 2.6: The basic idea of convection: an uneven heat\nsource in a fluid causes rising material next to the heat reveals convection is one the major forces in driving plate movements,\nand sinking material far from the heat.\nalong with gravity and density. PLATE TECTONICS | 27\n2.1.3 Development of Plate Tectonic Theory\nWegener died in 1930 on an expedition in Greenland.\nPoorly respected in his lifetime, Wegener and his ideas\nabout moving continents seemed destined to be lost in\nhistory as fringe science. However, in the 1950s, evidence\nstarted to trickle in that made continental drift a more\nviable idea. By the 1960s, scientists had amassed enough\nevidence to support the missing mechanism\u2014namely,\nseafloor spreading\u2014for Wegener\u2019s hypothesis of conti-\nnental drift to be accepted as the theory of plate tecton-\nics. Ongoing GPS and earthquake data analyses continue\nto support this theory. The next section provides the pieces\nof evidence that helped transform one man\u2019s wild notion\ninto a scientific theory.\nMapping of the Ocean Floors Figure 2.7: GPS measurements of plate motions.\nFigure 2.8: The complex chemistry around mid-ocean ridges.\nIn 1947 researchers started using an adaptation of SONAR to map a region in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with poorly-\nunderstood topographic and thermal properties. Using this information, Bruce Heezen and Marie Tharp created the first\ndetailed map of the ocean floor to reveal the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a basaltic mountain range that spanned the length of\nthe Atlantic Ocean, with rock chemistry and dimensions unlike the mountains found on the continents. Initially scientists\nthought the ridge was part of a mechanism that explained the expanding Earth or ocean-basin growth hypotheses. In\n1959, Harry Hess proposed the hypothesis of seafloor spreading\u2014that the mid-ocean ridges represented tectonic plate\nfactories, where new oceanic plate was issuing from these long volcanic ridges. Scientists later included transform faults\nperpendicular to the ridges to better account for varying rates of movement between the newly formed plates. When\nearthquake epicenters were discovered along the ridges, the idea that earthquakes were linked to plate movement took\nhold. 28 | PLATE TECTONICS\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

With more time, researchers discov-\nered these thinner sediment layers were located close to mid-ocean ridges, indicating the ridges were younger than the\nsurrounding ocean floor. This finding supported the idea that the sea floor was not fixed in one place.\nPaleomagnetism\nThe seafloor was also mapped magnetically.

First-\nhand information about what is below the surface is very\nlimited; most of what we know is pieced together from\nhypothetical models, and analyzing seismic wave data\nand meteorite materials. In general, the Earth can be\ndivided into layers based on chemical composition and\nphysical characteristics.\n2.2.1 Chemical Layers\nCertainly the earth is composed of a countless combina-\ntion of elements. Regardless of what elements are\ninvolved two major factors\u2014temperature and pres-\nFigure 2.14: The layers of the Earth. Physical layers include lithosphere\nsure\u2014are responsible for creating three distinct chemical\nand asthenosphere; chemical layers are crust, mantle, and core.\nlayers.\nCrust\nThe outermost chemical layer and the one we currently reside on, is the crust. There are two types of crust. Continental\ncrust has a relatively low density and composition similar to granite. Oceanic crust has a relatively high density, especially\nwhen cold and old, and composition similar to basalt. The surface levels of crust are relatively brittle. The deeper parts of\nthe crust are subjected to higher temperatures and pressure, which makes them more ductile. Ductile materials are like\nsoft plastics or putty, they move under force. Brittle materials are like solid glass or pottery, they break under force, espe-\ncially when it is applied quickly. Earthquakes, generally occur in the upper crust and are caused by the rapid movement of\nrelatively brittle materials. PLATE TECTONICS | 31\nThe base of the crust is characterized by a large increase\nin seismic velocity, which measures how fast earthquake\nwaves travel through solid matter. Called the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107\nDiscontinuity, or Moho for short, this zone was discovered\nby Andrija Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 (pronounced mo-ho-ro-vee-\ncheech; audio pronunciation) in 1909 after studying earth-\nquake wave paths in his native Croatia. The change in wave\ndirection and speed is caused by dramatic chemical differ-\nences of the crust and mantle. Underneath the oceans,\nthe Moho is found roughly 5 km below the ocean floor.\nUnder the continents, it is located about 30-40 km below\nthe surface. Near certain large mountain-building events Figure 2.15: The global map of the depth of the Moho.\nknown as orogenies, the continental Moho depth is dou-\nbled.\nMantle\nThe mantle sits below the crust and above the core. It is the largest chemical\nlayer by volume, extending from the base of the crust to a depth of about 2900\nkm. Most of what we know about the mantle comes from seismic wave analy-\nsis, though information is gathered by studying ophiolites and xenoliths. Ophi-\nolites are pieces of mantle that have risen through the crust until they are\nexposed as part of the ocean floor. Xenoliths are carried within magma and\nbrought to the Earth\u2019s surface by volcanic eruptions. Most xenoliths are made\nof peridotite, an ultramafic class of igneous rock (see section 4.2 for explana-\ntion). Because of this, scientists hypothesize most of the mantle is made of\nperidotite.\nFigure 2.16: This mantle xenolith containing\nCore olivine (green) is chemically weathering by\nhydrolysis and oxidation into the\npseudo-mineral iddingsite, which is a complex\nThe core of the Earth, which has both\nof water, clay, and iron oxides.

Scientists looking at\nseismic data first discovered this innermost chemical layer in 1906. Through a\nunion of hypothetical modeling, astronomical insight, and hard seismic data,\nthey concluded the core is mostly metallic iron. Scientists studying meteorites,\nwhich typically contain more iron than surface rocks, have proposed the earth\nwas formed from meteoric material. They believe the liquid component of the\ncore was created as the iron and nickel sank into the center of the planet, where\nFigure 2.17: A polished fragment of the\nit was liquefied by intense pressure.\niron-rich Toluca Meteorite, with octahedral\nWidmanst\u00e4tten pattern.\n2.2.2 Physical Layers\nThe Earth can also be broken down into five distinct physical layers based on how each layer responds to stress. While\nthere is some overlap in the chemical and physical designations of layers, specifically the core\u2013mantle boundary, there\nare significant differences between the two systems. 32 | PLATE TECTONICS\nLithosphere\nLithos is Greek for stone, and the lithosphere is the outermost\nphysical layer of the Earth. It is grouped into two types: oceanic\nand continental. Oceanic lithosphere is thin and relatively rigid.\nIt ranges in thickness from nearly zero in new plates found around\nmid-ocean ridges, to an average of 140 km in most other loca-\ntions. Continental lithosphere is generally thicker and consider-\nably more plastic, especially at the deeper levels. Its thickness\nranges from 40 to 280 km. The lithosphere is not continuous. It is\nbroken into segments called plates. A plate boundary is where\ntwo plates meet and move relative to each other. Plate bound-\naries are where we see plate tectonics in action\u2014mountain\nbuilding, triggering earthquakes, and generating volcanic activity.\nFigure 2.18: Map of the major plates and their motions along\nAsthenosphere boundaries.\nThe asthenosphere is the layer below the lithosphere.\nAstheno- means lacking strength, and the most distinctive prop-\nerty of the asthenosphere is movement. Because it is mechan-\nically weak, this layer moves and flows due to convection\ncurrents created by heat coming from the earth\u2019s core cause.\nUnlike the lithosphere that consists of multiple plates, the\nasthenosphere is relatively unbroken. Scientists have deter-\nmined this by analyzing seismic waves that pass through the\nlayer. The depth of at which the asthenosphere is found is tem-\nperature-dependent. It tends to lie closer to the earth\u2019s surface\naround mid-ocean ridges and much deeper underneath\nmountains and the centers of lithospheric plates.\nFigure 2.19: The lithosphere\u2013asthenosphere boundary changes\nwith certain tectonic situations.\nMesosphere\nThe mesosphere, sometimes known as the lower mantle, is more rigid and immobile\nthan the asthenosphere. Located at a depth of approximately 410 and 660 km below\nthe earth\u2019s surface, the mesosphere is subjected to very high pressures and tempera-\ntures. These extreme conditions create a transition zone in the upper mesosphere\nwhere minerals continuously change into various forms, or pseudomorphs. Scientists\nidentify this zone by changes in seismic velocity and sometimes physical barriers to\nmovement. Below this transitional zone, the mesosphere is relatively uniform until it\nreaches the core.\nFigure 2.20: General perovskite\nstructure. Perovskite silicates (i.e.,\nBridgmenite, (Mg,Fe)SiO3) are\nthought to be the main component of\nthe lower mantle, making it the most\ncommon mineral in or on Earth. PLATE TECTONICS | 33\nInner and Outer Core\nThe outer core is the only entirely liquid layer within the Earth. It starts at a depth of\n2,890 km and extends to 5,150 km, making it about 2,300 km thick. In 1936, the Dan-\nish geophysicist Inge Lehmann analyzed seismic data and was the first to prove a\nsolid inner core existed within a liquid outer core. The solid inner core is about 1,220\nkm thick, and the outer core is about 2,300 km thick.\nIt seems like a contradiction that\nthe hottest part of the Earth is\nsolid, as the minerals making up\nthe core should be liquified or\nvaporized at this temperature.\nImmense pressure keeps the\nminerals of the inner core in a\nsolid phase. The inner core\ngrows slowly from the lower\nouter core solidifying as heat\nescapes the interior of the Earth\nFigure 2.21: Lehmann in 1932. and is dispersed to the outer lay-\ners.\nThe earth\u2019s liquid outer core is critically important in maintaining a\nFigure 2.22: The outer core\u2019s spin causes our protective\nbreathable atmosphere and other environmental conditions favorable\nmagnetic field.\nfor life. Scientists believe the earth\u2019s magnetic field is generated by the\ncirculation of molten iron and nickel within the outer core. If the outer core were to stop circulating or become solid, the\nloss of the magnetic field would result in Earth getting stripped of life-supporting gases and water. This is what happened,\nand continues to happen, on Mars.\nComplete this interactive activity to check your understanding.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this interactive activity via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Convergent boundary movement is divided\ninto two types, subduction and collision, depending on\nthe density of the involved plates. Continental lithos-\nphere is of lower density and thus more buoyant than the\nunderlying asthenosphere. Oceanic lithosphere is more\ndense than continental lithosphere, and, when old and\ncold, may even be more dense than asthenosphere.\nWhen plates of different densities converge, the higher\ndensity plate is pushed beneath the more buoyant plate in Figure 2.25: Geologic provinces with the Shield (orange) and Platform\n(pink) comprising the craton, the stable interior of continents.\na process called subduction. When continental plates\nconverge without subduction occurring, this process is\ncalled collision.\n2.3.1. Subduction\nSubduction occurs when a dense oceanic plate meets a\nmore buoyant plate, like a continental plate or warmer/\nyounger oceanic plate, and descends into the mantle.\nThe worldwide average rate of oceanic plate subduction\nis 25 miles per million years, about a half-inch per year. As\nan oceanic plate descends, it pulls the ocean floor down\ninto a trench. These trenches can be more than twice as\ndeep as the average depth of the adjacent ocean basin,\nwhich is usually three to four km. The Mariana Trench, for\nexample, approaches a staggering 11 km.\nFigure 2.26: Diagram of ocean\u2013continent subduction. 36 | PLATE TECTONICS\nWithin the trench, ocean floor sediments are scraped\ntogether and compressed between the subducting and\noverriding plates. This feature is called the accretionary\nwedge, m\u00e9lange, or accretionary prism. Fragments of con-\ntinental material, including microcontinents, riding atop\nthe subducting plate may become sutured to the accre-\ntionary wedge and accumulate into a large area of land\ncalled a terrane. Vast portions of California are comprised\nof accreted terranes.\nFigure 2.27: Microcontinents can become part of the accretionary prism\nof a subduction zone.\nWhen the subducting oceanic plate, or slab, sinks into the mantle,\nthe immense heat and pressure pushes volatile materials like water\nand carbon dioxide into an area below the continental plate and\nabove the descending plate called the mantle wedge. The\nvolatiles are released mostly by hydrated minerals that revert to\nnon-hydrated minerals in these higher temperature and pressure\nconditions. When mixed with asthenospheric material above the\nplate, the volatile lower the melting point of the mantle wedge, and\nthrough a process called flux melting it becomes liquid magma.\nThe molten magma is more buoyant than the lithospheric plate\nabove it and migrates to the Earth\u2019s surface where it emerges as vol-\ncanism. The resulting volcanoes frequently appear as curved\nmountain chains, volcanic arcs, due to the curvature of the earth.\nBoth oceanic and continental plates can contain volcanic arcs.\nHow subduction is\ninitiated is still a mat-\nter of scientific\ndebate. It is generally\naccepted that sub-\nduction zones start\nFigure 2.28: Accreted terranes of western North America.\nas passive margins,\nEverything that is not the \u201cAncient continental interior\n(craton)\u201d has been smeared onto the side of the continent where oceanic and\nby accretion from subduction. continental plates\ncome together, and\nthen gravity initiates subduction and converts the passive margin into an\nactive one. One hypothesis is gravity pulls the denser oceanic plate down\nor the plate can start to flow ductility at a low angle. Scientists seeking to\nanswer this question have collected evidence that suggests a new subduc-\ntion zone is forming off the coast of Portugal. Some scientists have pro-\nposed large earthquakes like the 1755 Lisbon earthquake may even have\nsomething to do with this process of creating a subduction zone, although\nthe evidence is not definitive. Another hypothesis proposes subduction Figure 2.29: Location of the large (Mw 8.5-9.0) 1755\nhappens at transform boundaries involving plates of different densities. Lisbon earthquake. PLATE TECTONICS | 37\nSome plate boundaries look like they should be active, but show no evidence of subduction. The oceanic lithospheric\nplates on either side of the Atlantic Ocean for example, are denser than the underlying asthenosphere and are not\nsubducting beneath the continental plates. One hypothesis is the bond holding the oceanic and continental plates\ntogether is stronger than the downwards force created by the difference in plate densities.\nSubduction zones are known for having the largest earthquakes\nand tsunamis; they are the only places with fault surfaces large\nenough to create magnitude-9 earthquakes. These subduc-\ntion-zone earthquakes not only are very large, but also are very\ndeep. When a subducting slab becomes stuck and cannot\ndescend, a massive amount of energy builds up between the\nstuck plates. If this energy is not gradually dispersed, it may\nforce the plates to suddenly release along several hundred kilo-\nmeters of the subduction zone. Because subduction-zone\nfaults are located on the ocean floor, this massive amount of\nmovement can generate giant tsunamis such as those that fol-\nlowed the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and 2011 T\u014dhoku\nEarthquake in Japan.\nFigure 2.30: Earthquakes along the Sunda megathrust subduction\nzone, along the island of Sumatra, showing the 2006 Mw 9.1-9.3\nIndian Ocean earthquake as a star.\nAll subduction zones have a forearc basin, a feature of the\noverriding plate found between the volcanic arc and\noceanic trench. The forearc basin experiences a lot of\nfaulting and deformation activity, particularly within the\naccretionary wedge.\nFigure 2.31: Various parts of a subduction zone. This subduction zone is\nIn some subduction zones, tensional forces working on ocean\u2013ocean subduction, though the same features can apply to\ncontinent\u2013ocean subduction.\nthe continental plate create a backarc basin on the inte-\nrior side of the volcanic arc. Some scientists have pro-\nposed a subduction mechanism called oceanic slab rollback creates extension faults in the overriding plates. In this\nmodel, the descending oceanic slab does not slide directly under the overriding plate but instead rolls back, pulling the\noverlying plate seaward. The continental plate behind the volcanic arc gets stretched like pizza dough until the surface\ncracks and collapses to form a backarc basin. If the extension activity is extensive and deep enough, a backarc basin can\ndevelop into a continental rifting zone. These continental divergent boundaries may be less symmetrical than their mid-\nocean ridge counterparts.\nIn places where numerous young buoyant oceanic plates are converging and subducting at a relatively high velocity,\nthey may force the overlying continental plate to buckle and crack. This is called back-arc faulting. Extensional back-\narc faults pull rocks and chunks of plates apart. Compressional back-arc faults, also known as thrust faults, push them\ntogether. 38 | PLATE TECTONICS\nThe dual spines of the Andes Mountain range include a example of compressional thrust faulting. The western spine is\npart of a volcanic arc. Thrust faults have deformed the non-volcanic eastern spine, pushing rocks and pieces of continen-\ntal plate on top of each other.\nThere are two styles of thrust fault deformation: thin-skinned faults that occur in superficial rocks lying on top of the\ncontinental plate and thick-skinned faults that reach deeper into the crust. The Sevier Orogeny in the western U.S.\nis a notable thin-skinned type of deformation created during the Cretaceous Period. The Laramide Orogeny, a thick-\nskinned type of deformation, occurred near the end of and slightly after the Sevier Orogeny in the same region.\nFlat-slab, or shallow, subduction caused the Laramide Orogeny.\nWhen the descending slab subducts at a low angle, there is more\ncontact between the slab and the overlying continental plate than\nin a typical subduction zone. The shallowly-subducting slab pushes\nagainst the overriding plate and creates an area of deformation on\nthe overriding plate many kilometers away from the subduction\nzone.\nFigure 2.32: Shallow subduction during the Laramide\nOceanic\u2013Continental Subduction\norogeny.\nOceanic-continental subduction occurs when an oceanic plate\ndives below a continental plate. This convergent boundary has a\ntrench and mantle wedge and frequently, a volcanic arc. Well-\nknown examples of continental volcanic arcs are the Cascade\nMountains in the Pacific Northwest and western Andes Mountains in\nSouth America.\nOceanic\u2013Oceanic Subduction\nFigure 2.33: Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a\ncontinental plate, forming a trench and volcanic arc.\nThe boundaries of oceanic-oceanic subduction zones show very different\nactivity from those involving oceanic\u2013continental plates. Since both\nplates are made of oceanic lithosphere, it is usually the older plate that\nsubducts because it is colder and denser. The volcanism on the overlying\noceanic plate may remain hidden underwater.. If the volcanoes rise high\nenough the reach the ocean surface, the chain of volcanism forms an\nFigure 2.34: Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath\nanother oceanic plate, forming a trench and an island island arc. Examples of these island arcs include the Aleutian Islands in the\narc.\nnorthern Pacific Ocean, Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea, and numerous\nisland chains scattered throughout the western Pacific Ocean. PLATE TECTONICS | 39\n2.3.2. Collisions\nWhen continental plates converge, during the closing of an ocean basin\nfor example, subduction is not possible between the equally buoyant\nplates. Instead of one plate descending beneath another, the two masses\nof continental lithosphere slam together in a process known as collision.\nWithout subduction, there is no magma formation and no volcanism. Col-\nlision zones are characterized by tall, non-volcanic mountains; a broad\nzone of frequent, large earthquakes; and very little volcanism.\nWhen oceanic crust connected by a passive margin to continental crust\nFigure 2.35: Two continental plates colliding. completely subducts beneath a continent, an ocean basin closes, and\ncontinental collision begins. Eventually, as ocean basins close, continents\njoin together to form a massive accumulation of continents called a supercontinent, a process that has taken place in\n~500 million year old cycles over earth\u2019s history.\nThe process of collision created Pangea, the supercontinent envisioned by Wegener\nas the key component of his continental drift hypothesis. Geologists now have evi-\ndence that continental plates have been continuously converging into superconti-\nnents and splitting into smaller basin-separated continents throughout Earth\u2019s\nexistence, calling this process the supercontinent cycle, a process that takes place in\napproximately 500 million years. For example, they estimate Pangea began separat-\ning 200 million years ago. Pangea was preceded by an earlier supercontinents, one\nof which being Rodinia, which existed 1.1 billion years ago and started breaking apart\n800 million to 600 million years ago.\nA foreland basin is a feature that\ndevelops near mountain belts, as the\ncombined mass of the mountains\nFigure 2.36: A reconstruction of\nforms a depression in the lithospheric\nPangaea, showing approximate\nplate. While foreland basins may positions of modern continents.\noccur at subduction zones, they are\nmost commonly found at collision boundaries.

In very rare cases, part of a\ncontinental plate may become trapped beneath a descending oceanic\nplate in a process called obduction. When a portion of the continental\ncrust is driven down into the subduction zone, due to its buoyancy it\nreturns to the surface relatively quickly.\nAs pieces of the continental lithosphere break loose and migrate upward\nFigure 2.38: Pillow lavas, which only form under\nthrough the obduction zone, they bring along bits of the mantle and ocean\nwater, from an ophiolite in the Apennine Mountains\nfloor and amend them on top of the continental plate. Rocks composed of central Italy.\nof this mantle and ocean-floor material are called ophiolites and they pro-\nvide valuable information about the composition of the mantle. 40 | PLATE TECTONICS\nFigure 2.39: India crashing into Asia.\nThe area of collision-zone deformation and seismic activity usually covers a broader area because continental lithos-\nphere is plastic and malleable. Unlike subduction-zone earthquakes, which tend to be located along a narrow swath near\nthe convergent boundary, collision-zone earthquakes may occur hundreds of kilometers from the boundary between the\nplates.\nThe Eurasian continent has many examples of collision-zone deformations covering vast areas. The Pyrenees mountains\nbegin in the Iberian Peninsula and cross into France. Also, there are the Alps stretching from Italy to central Europe; the\nZagros mountains from Arabia to Iran; and Himalaya mountains from the Indian subcontinent to central Asia.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 2.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Continental rift zones occur in weak spots in the continental lithospheric plate. A mid-ocean ridge usually origi-\nnates in a continental plate as a rift zone that expands to the point of splitting the plate apart, with seawater filling in the\ngap. The separate pieces continue to drift apart and become individual continents. This process is known as rift-to-drift. PLATE TECTONICS | 41\n2.4.1. Continental Rifting\nIn places where the continental plates are very thick, they reflect so\nmuch heat back into the mantle it develops strong convection cur-\nrents that push super-heated mantle material up against the overly-\ning plate, softening it. Tensional forces created by this convective\nupwelling begin to pull the weakened plate apart. As it stretches, it\nbecomes thinner and develops deep cracks called extension or\nnormal faults. Eventually plate sections located between large faults\ndrop into deep depressions known as rift valleys, which often con-\ntain keystone-shaped blocks of down-dropped crust known as\nFigure 2.40: Faulting that occurs in divergent boundaries. grabens. The shoulders of these grabens are called horsts. If only\none side of a section drops, it is called a half-graben. Depending on\nthe conditions, rifts can grow into very large lakes and even oceans.\nWhile seemingly occurring at random, rifting is dictated by two factors. Rifting\ndoes not occur in continents with older and more stable interiors, known as cra-\ntons. When continental rifting does occur, the break-up pattern resembles the\nseams of a soccer ball, also called a truncated icosahedron. This is the most\ncommon surface-fracture pattern to develop on an evenly expanding sphere\nbecause it uses the least amount of energy.\nUsing the soccer ball model, rifting tends to lengthen and expand along a par-\nticular seam while fizzling out in the other directions. These seams with little or\nno tectonic activity are called failed rift arms. A failed rift arm is still a weak spot\nin the continental plate; even without the presence of active extension faults,\nit may develop into a called an aulacogen. One example of a failed rift arm is\nthe Mississippi Valley Embayment, a depression through which the upper end\nFigure 2.41: The Afar Triangle (center) has the\nof the Mississippi River flows. Occasionally connected rift arms do develop con-\nRed Sea ridge (center to upper left), Gulf of\ncurrently, creating multiple boundaries of active rifting.

Narrow rifts are characterized by\na high density of highly active divergent boundaries. The East African Rift\nZone, where the horn of Africa is pulling away from the mainland, is an excel-\nlent example of an active narrow rift. Lake Baikal in Russia is another. Broad\nrifts also have numerous fault zones, but they are distributed over wide areas\nof deformation. The Basin and Range region located in the western United\nStates is a type of broad rift. The Wasatch Fault, which also created the\nWasatch Mountain Range in the state of Utah, forms the eastern divergent\nboundary of this broad rift (animation 1 and animation 2).\nFigure 2.42: NASA image of the Basin and Range\nhorsts and grabens across central Nevada. 42 | PLATE TECTONICS\nRifts have earthquakes, although not of the magnitude and frequency of other\nboundaries. They may also exhibit volcanism. Unlike the flux-melted magma found\nin subduction zones, rift-zone magma is created by decompression melting. As the\ncontinental plates are pulled apart, they create a region of low pressure that melts\nthe lithosphere and draws it upwards. When this molten magma reaches the weak-\nened and fault-riddled rift zone, it migrates to surface by breaking through the plate\nor escaping via an open fault. Examples of young rift volcanoes dot the Basin and\nRange region in the United States. Rift-zone activity is responsible for generating\nsome unique volcanism, such as the Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania. This volcano\nerupts lava consisting largely of carbonatite, a relatively cold, liquid carbonate min-\neral.\n2.4.2. Mid-ocean Ridges\nAs rifting and volcanic activity\nprogress, the continental lithos-\nphere becomes more mafic (see\nchapter 4) and thinner, with the\neventual result transforming the\nplate under the rifting area into\noceanic lithosphere. This is the Figure 2.43: India colliding into Eurasia to\ncreate the modern day Himalayas.\nprocess that gives birth to a new\nocean, much like the narrow Red\nSea emerged with the movement of Arabia away from Africa. As the\noceanic lithosphere continues to diverge, a mid-ocean ridge is formed.\nMid-ocean ridges, also known as spreading centers, have several dis-\ntinctive features. They are the only places on earth that create new\noceanic lithosphere. Decompression melting in the rift zone changes\nasthenosphere material into new lithosphere, which oozes up through\ncracks in oceanic plate. The amount of new lithosphere being created at\nmid-ocean ridges is highly significant. These undersea rift volcanoes\nproduce more lava than all other types of volcanism combined. Despite\nthis, most mid-oceanic ridge volcanism remains unmapped because the\nvolcanoes are located deep on the ocean floor.\nFigure 2.44: Progression from rift to mid-ocean ridge.\nIn rare cases, such as a few locations in Iceland, rift zones display the type\nof volcanism, spreading, and ridge formation found on the ocean floor. PLATE TECTONICS | 43\nThe ridge feature is created by the accumulation of hot lithosphere\nmaterial, which is lighter than the dense underlying asthenosphere.\nThis chunk of isostatically buoyant lithosphere sits partially submerged\nand partially exposed on the asthenosphere, like an ice cube floating\nin a glass of water.\nAs the ridge continues to spread, the lithosphere material is pulled\naway from the area of volcanism and becomes colder and denser. As\nit continues to spread and cool, the lithosphere settles into wide\nswathes of relatively featureless topography called abyssal plains with\nlower topography.\nFigure 2.45: Age of oceanic lithosphere, in millions of\nyears. Notice the differences in the Atlantic Ocean along\nThis model of ridge formation suggests the sections of lithosphere\nthe coasts of the continents.\nfurthest away from the mid-ocean ridges will be the oldest. Scientists\nhave tested this idea by comparing the age of rocks located in various locations on the ocean floor. Rocks found near\nridges are younger than those found far away from any ridges. Sediment accumulation patterns also confirm the idea of\nsea-floor spreading. Sediment layers tend to be thinner near mid-ocean ridges, indicating it has had less time to build up.\nAs mentioned in the section on paleomagnetism and the development of plate\ntectonic theory, scientists noticed mid-ocean ridges contained unique mag-\nnetic anomalies that show up as symmetrical striping on both sides of the ridge.\nThe Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis proposes these alternating reversals are\ncreated by the earth\u2019s magnetic field being imprinted into magma after it\nemerges from the ridge. Very hot magma has no magnetic field. As the oceanic\nplates get pulled apart, the magma cools below the Curie point, the tempera-\nture below which a magnetic field gets locked into magnetic minerals. The\nalternating magnetic reversals in the rocks reflects the periodic swapping of\nFigure 2.46: A time progression (with \u201ca\u201d being\nearth\u2019s magnetic north and south poles.

The ridges are often studded with\nhydrothermal vents, deep fissures that allow seawater to circulate through the\nupper portions of the oceanic plate and interact with hot rock. The super-\nheated seawater rises back up to the surface of the plate, carrying dissolved\ngasses and minerals, and small particulates. The resulting emitted hydrother-\nmal water looks like black underwater smoke.\nScientists had known about these geothermal areas on the ocean floor for\nsome time. However, it was not until 1977, when scientists piloting a deep sub-\nmergence vehicle, the Alvin, discovered a thriving community of organisms\nclustered around these hydrothermal vents. These unique organisms, which\ninclude 10-foot-long tube worms taller than people, live in the complete dark-\nness of the ocean floor deprived of oxygen and sunlight. They use geothermal\nenergy provided by the vents and a process called bacterial chemosynthesis\nto feed on sulfur compounds. Before this discovery, scientists believed life on\nearth could not exist without photosynthesis, a process that requires sunlight.\nSome scientists suggest this type of environment could have been the origin of Figure 2.47: Black smoker hydrothermal vent\nlife on Earth, and perhaps even extraterrestrial life elsewhere in the galaxy, such with a colony of giant (6\u2019+) tube worms.\nas on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 2.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This movement is described based on the perspective of an\nobserver standing on one of the plates, looking across the boundary at the\nopposing plate. Dextral, also known as right-lateral, movement describes\nthe opposing plate moving to the right. Sinistral, also known as left lateral,\nmovement describe the opposing plate moving to the left.\nFigure 2.48: The two types of transform/strike-slip\nfaults. Most transform boundaries are found on the ocean floor, around mid-\nocean ridges. These boundaries form aseismic fracture zones, filled with\nearthquake-free transform faults, to accommodate different rates of spreading occurring at the ridge. PLATE TECTONICS | 45\nSome transform boundaries produce significant seismic activity, primarily as earth-\nquakes, with very little mountain-building or volcanism. This type of transform boundary\nmay contain a single fault or series of faults, which develop in places where plate tec-\ntonic stresses are transferred to the surface. As with other types of active boundaries, if\nthe plates are unable to shear past each other the tectonic forces will continue to build\nup. If the built up energy between the plates is suddenly released, the result is an earth-\nquake.\nIn the eyes of humanity, the most significant transform faults occur within continental\nplates, and have a shearing motion that frequently produces moderate-to-large magni-\ntude earthquakes. Notable examples include the San Andreas Fault in California, North-\nern and Eastern Anatolian Faults in Turkey, Altyn Tagh Fault in central Asia, and Alpine\nFault in New Zealand.\n2.5.1 Transpression and Transtension Figure 2.49: Map of the San Andreas\nfault, showing relative motion.\nBends along transform faults may create compressional or\nextensional forces that cause secondary faulting zones. Transpression occurs where there is\na component of compression in addition to the shearing motion. These forces build up around\nthe area of the bend, where the opposing plates are restricted from sliding past each other. As\nthe forces continue to build up, they create mountains in the restraining bend around the fault.\nThe Big Bend area, located in the southern part of the San Andreas Fault includes a large area\nof transpression where many mountains have been built, moved, and even rotated.\nTranstension zones require a fault that includes a releasing bend,\nwhere the plates are being pulled apart by extensional forces. Depres-\nFigure 2.50: A sions and sometimes volcanism develop in the releasing bend, along\ntranspressional strike-slip the fault.

Tuzo Wilson who first described it\nin 1966, and it outlines the ongoing origin and breakup of supercon-\ntinents, such as Pangea and Rodinia. Scientists have determined this\ncycle has been operating for at least three billion years and possibly\nearlier.\nThere are a number of hypotheses about how the Wilson Cycle\nworks. One mechanism proposes that rifting happens because con-\ntinental plates reflect the heat much better than oceanic plates.\nWhen continents congregate together, they reflect more of the\nFigure 2.53: Diagram of the Wilson Cycle, showing rifting\nEarth\u2019s heat back into the mantle, generating more vigorous convec-\nand collision phases.\ntion currents that then start the continental rifting process. Some\ngeologists believe mantle plumes are remnants of these periods of increased mantle temperature and convection\nupwelling, and study them for clues about the origin of continental rifting.\nThe mechanism behind how supercontinents are created is still largely a mystery. There are three schools of thought\nabout what continues to drive the continents further apart and eventually bring them together. The ridge-push hypothesis PLATE TECTONICS | 47\nsuggests after the initial rifting event, plates continue to be pushed apart by mid-ocean spreading centers and their\nunderlying convection currents. Slab-pull proposes the plates are pulled apart by descending slabs in the subduction\nzones of the oceanic\u2013continental margins. A third idea, gravitational sliding, attributes the movement to gravitational\nforces pulling the lithospheric plates down from the elevated mid-ocean ridges and across the underlying asthenos-\nphere. Current evidence seems to support slab pull more than ridge push or gravitational sliding.\n2.7 Hotspots\nThe Wilson Cycle provides a broad overview of tectonic plate movement. To analyze plate\nmovement more precisely, scientists study hotspots. First postulated by J. Tuzo Wilson in\n1963, a hotspot is an area in the lithospheric plate where molten magma breaks through and\ncreates a volcanic center, islands in the ocean and mountains on land. As the plate moves\nacross the hotspot, the volcano center becomes extinct because it is no longer over an\nactive magma source. Instead, the magma emerges through another area in the plate to cre-\nate a new active volcano. Over time, the combination of moving plate and stationary hotspot\ncreates a chain of islands or mountains. The classic definition of hotspots states they do not\nmove, although recent evidence suggests that there may be exceptions.\nHotspots are the only types of\nvolcanism not associated with\nsubduction or rifting zones at\nplate boundaries; they seem\nFigure 2.54: Diagram showing\ntotally disconnected from any\na non-moving source of\nplate tectonics processes, such magma (mantle plume) and a\nas earthquakes. However, there moving overriding plate.\nare relationships between\nhotspots and plate tectonics. There are several hotspots,\ncurrent and former, that are believed to have begun at the time\nof rifting. Also, scientists use the age of volcanic eruptions and\nFigure 2.55: Map of world hotspots. Larger circles indicate more\nactive hotspots. shape of the chain to quantify the rate and direction of plate\nmovement relative to the hotspot.\nScientists are divided over how magma is generated in hotspots. Some suggest that hotspots originate from super-heated\nmaterial from as deep as the core that reaches the Earth\u2019s crust as a mantle plume. Others argue the molten material that\nfeeds hotspots is sourced from the mantle. Of course, it is difficult to collect data from these deep-Earth features due to\nthe extremely high pressure and temperature.\nHow hotspots are initiated is another highly debated subject. The prevailing mechanism has hotspots starting in divergent\nboundaries during supercontinent rifting. Scientists have identified a number of current and past hotspots believed to\nhave begun this way. Subducting slabs have also been named as causing mantle plumes and hot-spot volcanism. Some\ngeologists have suggested another geological process not involving plate tectonics may be involved, such as a large\nspace objects crashing into Earth. Regardless of how they are formed, dozens are on the Earth. Some well-known exam-\nples include the Tahiti Islands, Afar Triangle, Easter Island, Iceland, Galapagos Islands, and Samoan Islands. The United\nStates is home to two of the largest and best-studied hotspots: Hawaii and Yellowstone. 48 | PLATE TECTONICS\n2.7.1 Hawaiian Hotspot\nThe active volcanoes in Hawaii represent one of the most\nactive hotspot sites on earth. Scientific evidence indicates the\nHawaiian hotspot is at least 80 million years old. Geologists\nbelieve it is actually much older; however any rocks with proof\nof this have been subducted under the ocean floor. The big\nisland of Hawaii sits atop a large mantle plume that marks the\nactive hotspot. The Kilauea volcano is the main vent for this\nhotspot and has been actively erupting since 1983.\nThis enormous volcanic island chain, much of which is under-\nwater, stretches across the Pacific for almost 6,000 km. The\nseamount chain\u2019s most striking feature is a sharp 60-degree\nbend located at the midpoint, which marks a significant\nchange in plate movement direction that occurred 50 million\nyears ago. The change in direction has been more often linked\nto a plate reconfiguration, but also to other things like plume\nmigration.\nFigure 2.56: The Hawaii\u2013Emperor seamount and island chain.\nIn an attempt to map the Hawaiian mantle plume as far\ndown as the lower mantle, scientists have used tomogra-\nphy, a type of three-dimensional seismic imaging. This infor-\nmation\u2014along with other evidence gathered from rock ages,\nvegetation types, and island size\u2014indicate the oldest islands\nin the chain are located the furthest away from the active\nhotspot.\nFigure 2.57: Diagram of the Hawaiian hotspot and islands that it\nformed.\n2.7.2 Yellowstone Hotspot\nLike the Hawaiian version, the Yellowstone hotspot is formed by\nmagma rising through the lithosphere. What makes it different is\nthis hotspot is located under a thick, continental plate. Hawaii sits\non a thin oceanic plate, which is easily breached by magma com-\ning to the surface. At Yellowstone, the thick continental plate pre-\nsents a much more difficult barrier for magma to penetrate. When\nit does emerge, the eruptions are generally much more violent.\nThankfully they are also less frequent.\nOver 15 million years of eruptions by this hotspot have carved a\ncurved path across the western United States. It has been sug-\ngested the Yellowstone hotspot is connected to the much older\nColumbia River flood basalts and even to 70 million-year-old vol- Figure 2.58: The track of the Yellowstone hotspot, which\ncanism found in the Yukon region of Canada. shows the age of different eruptions in millions of years ago. PLATE TECTONICS | 49\nThe most recent major eruption of this hotspot created the Yel-\nlowstone Caldera and Lava Creek tuff formation approximately\n631,000 years ago. The eruption threw 1,000 cubic kilometers of\nash and magma into the atmosphere, some of which was found\nas far away as Mississippi. Should the hotspot erupt again, scien-\ntists predict it will be another massive event. This would be a\ncalamity reaching far beyond the western United States. These\nsuper volcanic eruptions fill the earth\u2019s atmosphere with so\nmuch gas and ash, they block sunlight from reaching the earth.\nNot only would this drastically alter climates and environments\naround the globe, it could affect worldwide food production.\nFigure 2.59: Several prominent ash beds found in North America,\nincluding three Yellowstone eruptions shaded pink (Mesa Falls,\nHuckleberry Ridge, and Lava Creek), the Bisho Tuff ash bed\n(brown dashed line), and the modern May 18th, 1980 ash fall\n(yellow).\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for sections 2.6 and 2.7 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In geology, the classic definition of a mineral is: 1) naturally occurring, 2) inorganic, 3) solid at room temperature, 4)\nregular crystal structure, and 5) defined chemical composition. Some natural substances technically should not be con-\nsidered minerals, but are included by exception. For example, water and mercury are liquid at room temperature. Both\nare considered minerals because they were classified before the room-temperature rule was accepted as part of the\ndefinition. Calcite is quite often formed by organic processes, but is considered a mineral because it is widely found and\ngeologically important. Because of these discrepancies, the International Mineralogical Association in 1985 amended the\ndefinition to: \u201cA mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a\nresult of geological processes.\u201d This means that the calcite in the shell of a clam is not considered a mineral. But once that\nclam shell undergoes burial, diagenesis, or other geological processes, then the calcite is considered a mineral. Typically,\nsubstances like coal, pearl, opal, or obsidian that do not fit the definition of mineral are called mineraloids.\nA rock is a substance that contains one or more minerals or mineraloids. As is discussed in later chapters, there are three\ntypes of rocks composed of minerals: igneous (rocks crystallizing from molten material), sedimentary (rocks composed\nof products of mechanical weathering (sand, gravel, etc.) and chemical weathering (things precipitated from solution),\nand metamorphic (rocks produced by alteration of other rocks by heat and pressure.\n3.1 Chemistry of Minerals\nRocks are composed of minerals that have a specific chemical composition. To understand mineral chemistry, it is essen-\ntial to examine the fundamental unit of all matter, the atom. 58 | MINERALS\n3.1.1 The Atom\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Atoms consists of subatomic particles\u2014protons, neutrons, and electrons. A simple model of the\natom has a central nucleus composed of protons, which have positive charges, and neutrons which have no charge. A\ncloud of negatively charged electrons surrounds the nucleus, the number of electrons equaling the number of protons\nthus balancing the positive charge of the protons for a neutral atom. Protons and neutrons each have a mass number of\n1. The mass of an electron is less than 1/1000th that of a proton or neutron, meaning most of the atom\u2019s mass is in the\nnucleus.\n3.1.2 Periodic Table of the Elements\nMatter is composed of elements which are atoms that have a specific number of protons in the nucleus. This number of\nprotons is called the Atomic Number for the element. For example, an oxygen atom has 8 protons and an iron atom has\n26 protons. An element cannot be broken down chemically into a simpler form and retains unique chemical and physical\nproperties. Each element behaves in a unique manner in nature. This uniqueness led scientists to develop a periodic table\nof the elements, a tabular arrangement of all known elements listed in order of their atomic number.\nFigure 3.1: The periodic table of the elements. MINERALS | 59\nThe first arrangement of elements into a periodic table was done by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 using the elements known\nat the time. In the periodic table, each element has a chemical symbol, name, atomic number, and atomic mass. The\nchemical symbol is an abbreviation for the element, often derived from a Latin or Greek name for the substance. The\natomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus. The atomic mass is the number of protons and neutrons in the\nnucleus, each with a mass number of one. Since the mass of electrons is so much less than the protons and neutrons, the\natomic mass is effectively the number of protons plus neutrons.\nThe atomic mass of natural elements represents an average mass of the atoms\ncomprising that substance in nature and is usually not a whole number as seen on\nthe periodic table, meaning that an element exists in nature with atoms having dif-\nferent numbers of neutrons. The differing number of neutrons affects the mass of an\nelement in nature and the atomic mass number represents this average. This gives\nFigure 3.2: Formation of carbon-14 from\nrise to the concept of isotope. Isotopes are forms of an element with the same\nnitrogen-14.\nnumber of protons but different numbers of neutrons. There are usually several iso-\ntopes for a particular element. For example, 98.9% of carbon atoms have 6 protons and 6 neutrons. This isotope of carbon\nis called carbon-12 (12C). A few carbon atoms, carbon-13 (13C), have 6 protons and 7 neutrons. A trace amount of carbon\natoms, carbon-14 (14C), has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.\nAmong the 118 known elements, the heaviest are fleeting\nhuman creations known only in high energy particle accel-\nerators, and they decay rapidly. The heaviest naturally\noccurring element is uranium, atomic number 92. The\neight most abundant elements in Earth\u2019s continental crust\nare shown in Table 1. These elements are found in the most\ncommon rock forming minerals.\nElement Symbol Abundance %\nOxygen O 47%\nSilicon Si 28%\nAluminum Al 8%\nIron Fe 5%\nCalcium Ca 4%\nSodium Na 3%\nPotassium K 3%\nMagnesium Mg 2%\nFigure 3.3: Element abundance pie chart for Earth\u2019s crust.\nTable 3.1: Eight most abundant elements in the Earth\u2019s con-\ntinental crust (% by weight). All other elements are less than 1%. (Source: USGS).\n3.1.3 Chemical Bonding\nMost substances on Earth are compounds containing multiple elements. Chemical\nbonding describes how these atoms attach with each other to form compounds, such\nas sodium and chlorine combining to form NaCl, common table salt. Compounds that\nare held together by chemical bonds are called molecules. Water is a compound of\nhydrogen and oxygen in which two hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded with one\nFigure 3.4: A model of a water oxygen making the water molecule. The oxygen we breathe is formed when one oxygen\nmolecule, showing the bonds\natom covalently bonds with another oxygen atom to make the molecule O2. The sub-\nbetween the hydrogen and oxygen.\nscript 2 in the chemical formula indicates the molecule contains two atoms of oxygen. 60 | MINERALS\nMost minerals are also compounds of more than one element. The common mineral calcite has the chemical formula\nCaCO3 indicating the molecule consists of one calcium, one carbon, and three oxygen atoms. In calcite, one carbon and\nthree oxygen atoms are held together by covalent bonds to form a molecular ion, called carbonate, which has a negative\ncharge. Calcium as an ion has a positive charge of plus two. The two oppositely charged ions attract each other and com-\nbine to form the mineral calcite, CaCO3. The name of the chemical compound is calcium carbonate, where calcium is Ca\nand carbonate refers to the molecular ion CO3-2.\nThe mineral olivine has the chemical formula (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, in which one silicon and four oxygen atoms are bonded with\ntwo atoms of either magnesium or iron. The comma between iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg) indicates the two elements\ncan occupy the same location in the crystal structure and substitute for one another.\nValence and Charge\nThe electrons around the atom\u2019s nucleus are located in shells representing different energy levels. The outermost shell is\ncalled the valence shell. Electrons in the valence shell are involved in chemical bonding. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a\nsimple model of the atom that states atoms are more stable when their outermost shell is full. Atoms of most elements\nthus tend to gain or lose electrons so the outermost or valence shell is full. In Bohr\u2019s model, the innermost shell can have\na maximum of two electrons and the second and third shells can have a maximum of eight electrons. When the innermost\nshell is the valence shell, as in the case of hydrogen and helium, it obeys the octet rule when it is full with two electrons.\nFor elements in higher rows, the octet rule of eight electrons in the valence shell applies.\nThe rows in the periodic table present the elements in order of atomic number and the columns\norganize elements with similar characteristics, such as the same number of electrons in their\nvalence shells. Columns are often labeled from left to right with Roman numerals I to VIII, and\nArabic numerals 1 through 18. The elements in columns I and II have 1 and 2 electrons in their\nrespective valence shells and the elements in columns VI and VII have 6 and 7 electrons in their\nrespective valence shells.\nFigure 3.5: The carbon\ndioxide molecule. Since\noxygen is -2 and carbon is In row 3 and column I, sodium (Na) has 11 protons in the nucleus and 11 electrons in three\n+4, the two oxygens bond shells\u20142 electrons in the inner shell, 8 electrons in the second shell, and 1 electron in the\nto the carbon to form a\nvalence shell. To maintain a full outer shell of 8 electrons per the octet rule, sodium readily\nneutral molecule.\ngives up that 1 electron so there are 10 total electrons. With 11 positively charged protons in the\nnucleus and 10 negatively charged electrons in two shells, sodium when forming chemical bonds is an ion with an overall\nnet charge of +1.\nAll elements in column I have a single electron in their valence shell and a valence of 1. These other column I elements\nalso readily give up this single valence electron and thus become ions with a +1 charge. Elements in column II readily give\nup 2 electrons and end up as ions with a charge of +2. Note that elements in columns I and II which readily give up their\nvalence electrons, often form bonds with elements in columns VI and VII which readily take up these electrons. Elements\nin columns 3 through 15 are usually involved in covalent bonding. The last column 18 (VIII) contains the noble gases. These\nelements are chemically inert because the valence shell is already full with 8 electrons, so they do not gain or lose elec-\ntrons. An example is the noble gas helium which has 2 valence electrons in the first shell. Its valence shell is therefore full.\nAll elements in column VIII possess full valence shells and do not form bonds with other elements.\nAs seen above, an atom with a net positive or negative charge as a result of gaining or losing electrons is called an ion. In\ngeneral the elements on the left side of the table lose electrons and become positive ions, called cations because they\nare attracted to the cathode in an electrical device. The elements on the right side tend to gain electrons. These are called\nanions because they are attracted to the anode in an electrical device. The elements in the center of the periodic table,\ncolumns 3 through 15, do not consistently follow the octet rule. These are called transition elements. A common example\nis iron, which has a +2 or +3 charge depending on the oxidation state of the element. Oxidized Fe+3 carries a +3 charge\nand reduced Fe+2 is +2. These two different oxidation states of iron often impart dramatic colors to rocks containing their\nminerals\u2014the oxidized form producing red colors and the reduced form producing green. MINERALS | 61\nIonic Bonding\nIonic bonds, also called electron-transfer bonds, are formed by the electrostatic attraction\nbetween atoms having opposite charges. Atoms of two opposite charges attract each other\nelectrostatically and form an ionic bond in which the positive ion transfers its electron (or elec-\ntrons) to the negative ion which takes them up. Through this transfer both atoms thus achieve a\nfull valence shell. For example one atom of sodium (Na+1) and one atom of chlorine (Cl-1) form\nan ionic bond to make the compound sodium chloride (NaCl). This is also known as the mineral\nhalite or common table salt. Another example is calcium (Ca+2) and chlorine (Cl-1) combining to\nmake the compound calcium chloride (CaCl2). The subscript 2 indicates two atoms of chlorine\nare ionically bonded to one atom of calcium. Figure 3.6: Cubic\narrangement of Na and Cl in\nhalite.\nCovalent Bonding\nIonic bonds are usually formed between a metal and a nonmetal. Another type, called a\ncovalent or electron-sharing bond, commonly occurs between nonmetals. Covalent bonds\nshare electrons between ions to complete their valence shells. For example, oxygen (atomic\nnumber 8) has 8 electrons\u20142 in the inner shell and 6 in the valence shell. Gases like oxygen\noften form diatomic molecules by sharing valence electrons. In the case of oxygen, two\natoms attach to each other and share 2 electrons to fill their valence shells to become the\ncommon oxygen molecule we breathe (O2). Methane (CH4) is another covalently bonded gas.\nThe carbon atom needs 4 electrons and each hydrogen needs 1. Each hydrogen shares its\nelectron with the carbon to form a molecule as shown in the figure.\nFigure 3.7: Methane molecule.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 3.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Three main ways this occurs in nature are: 1) pre-\ncipitation directly from an aqueous (water) solution with a temperature change, 2) crystallization from a magma with a\ntemperature change, and 3) biological precipitation by the action of organisms. 62 | MINERALS\n3.2.1 Precipitation From Aqueous Solution\nSolutions consist of ions or molecules, known as solutes, dissolved in a\nmedium or solvent. In nature this solvent is usually water. Many minerals can\nbe dissolved in water, such as halite or table salt, which has the composition\nsodium chloride, NaCl. The Na+1 and Cl-1 ions separate and disperse into the\nsolution.\nPrecipitation is the reverse process, in which ions in solution come together\nto form solid minerals. Precipitation is dependent on the concentration of\nions in solution and other factors such as temperature and pressure. The\npoint at which a solvent cannot hold any more solute is called saturation. Pre-\nFigure 3.8: Calcium carbonate deposits from hard\ncipitation can occur when the temperature of the solution falls, when the\nwater.\nsolute evaporates, or with changing chemical conditions in the solution. An\nexample of precipitation in our homes is when water evaporates and leaves behind a rind of minerals on faucets, shower\nheads, and drinking glasses.\nIn nature, changes in environmental conditions may cause the minerals dissolved in water to form bonds and grow into\ncrystals or cement grains of sediment together. In Utah, deposits of tufa formed from mineral-rich springs that emerged\ninto the ice age Lake Bonneville. Now exposed in dry valleys, this porous tufa was a natural insulation used by pioneers to\nbuild their homes with a natural protection against summer heat and winter cold. The travertine terraces at Mammoth Hot\nSprings in Yellowstone Park are another example formed by calcite precipitation at the edges of the shallow spring-fed\nponds.\nAnother example of precipitation occurs in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, where\nthe concentration of sodium chloride and other salts is nearly eight times\ngreater than in the world\u2019s oceans. Streams carry salt ions into the lake from\nthe surrounding mountains. With no other outlet, the water in the lake evapo-\nrates and the concentration of salt increases until saturation is reached and\nthe minerals precipitate out as sediments. Similar salt deposits include\nhalite and other precipitates, and occur in other lakes like Mono Lake in Cali-\nfornia and the Dead Sea.\nFigure 3.9: The Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah.\n3.2.2 Crystallization From Magma\nHeat is energy that causes atoms in substances to vibrate. Tempera-\nture is a measure of the intensity of the vibration. If the vibrations are\nviolent enough, chemical bonds are broken and the crystals melt\nreleasing the ions into the melt. Magma is molten rock with freely mov-\ning ions. When magma is emplaced at depth or extruded onto the sur-\nface (then called lava), it starts to cool and mineral crystals can form.\nFigure 3.10: Lava, magma at the Earth\u2019s surface. MINERALS | 63\n3.2.3 Precipitation by Organisms\nMany organisms build bones, shells, and body coverings by extracting ions\nfrom water and precipitating minerals biologically. The most common min-\neral precipitated by organisms is calcite, or calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Cal-\ncite is often precipitated by organisms as a polymorph called aragonite.\nPolymorphs are crystals with the same chemical formula but different crystal\nstructures. Marine invertebrates such as corals and clams precipitate arago-\nnite or calcite for their shells and structures. Upon death, their hard parts\naccumulate on the ocean floor as sediments, and eventually may become\nthe sedimentary rock limestone. Though limestone can form inorganically,\nthe vast majority is formed by this biological process. Another example is\nmarine organisms called radiolaria, which are zooplankton that precipitate\nFigure 3.11: Ammonite shell made of calcium\ncarbonate. silica for their microscopic external shells. When the organisms die, the shells\naccumulate on the ocean floor and can form the sedimentary rock chert. An\nexample of biologic precipitation from the vertebrate world is bone, which is composed mostly of a type of apatite, a\nmineral in the phosphate group. The apatite found in bones contains calcium and water in its structure and is called\nhydroxycarbonate apatite, Ca5(PO4)3(OH). As mentioned above, such substances are not technically minerals until the\norganism dies and these hard parts become fossils.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 3.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:\nhttps://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/introearthscience/?p=234#h5p-18\n3.3 Silicate Minerals\nMinerals are categorized based on their composition and structure. Silicate minerals are\nbuilt around a molecular ion called the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has a\npyramid-like shape with four sides and four corners. Silicate minerals form the largest\ngroup of minerals on Earth, comprising the vast majority of the Earth\u2019s mantle and crust.\nOf the nearly four thousand known minerals on Earth, most are rare. There are only a few\nthat make up most of the rocks likely to be encountered by surface dwelling creatures like\nus. These are generally called the rock-forming minerals.\nFigure 3.12: A tetrahedra. 64 | MINERALS\nThe silicon-oxygen tetrahedron (SiO4) consists of a single silicon atom at the center and four oxy-\ngen atoms located at the four corners of the tetrahedron. Each oxygen ion has a -2 charge and the\nsilicon ion has a +4 charge. The silicon ion shares one of its four valence electrons with each of the\nfour oxygen ions in a covalent bond to create a symmetrical geometric four-sided pyramid figure.\nOnly half of the oxygen\u2019s valence electrons are shared, giving the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron an\nionic charge of -4. This silicon-oxygen tetrahedron forms bonds with many other combinations of\nions to form the large group of silicate minerals.\nThe silicon ion is much smaller than the oxygen ions (see the figures) and fits into a small space in\nthe center of the four large oxygen ions, seen if the top ball is removed (as shown in the figure to\nthe right). Because only one of the valence electrons of the corner oxygens is shared, the silicon-\nFigure 3.13: Silicate\ntetrahedron. oxygen tetrahedron has chemically active corners available to form bonds with other silica tetra-\nhedra or other positively charged ions such as Al+3, Fe+2,+3, Mg+2, K+1, Na+1, and Ca+2. Depending on\nmany factors, such as the original magma chemistry, silica-oxygen tetrahedra can combine with other tetrahedra in sev-\neral different configurations. For example, tetrahedra can be isolated, attached in chains, sheets, or three dimensional struc-\ntures. These combinations and others create the chemical structure in which positively charged ions can be inserted for\nunique chemical compositions forming silicate mineral groups.\n3.3.1 The Dark Ferromagnesian Silicates\nOlivine Family\nOlivine is the primary mineral component in mantle rock such as peri-\ndotite and basalt. It is characteristically green when not weathered. The\nchemical formula is (Fe,Mg)2SiO4. As previously described, the comma\nbetween iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg) indicates these two elements\noccur in a solid solution. Not to be confused with a liquid solution, a solid\nsolution occurs when two or more elements have similar properties and\ncan freely substitute for each other in the same location in the crystal struc-\nture.\nOlivine is referred to as a mineral\nFigure 3.14: Olivine crystals in basalt.\nfamily because of the ability of iron\nand magnesium to substitute for\neach other. Iron and magnesium in the olivine family indicates a solid solution form-\ning a compositional series within the mineral group which can form crystals of all iron\nas one end member and all mixtures of iron and magnesium in between to all mag-\nnesium at the other end member. Different mineral names are applied to composi-\ntions between these end members. In the olivine series of minerals, the iron and\nmagnesium ions in the solid solution are about the same size and charge, so either\natom can fit into the same location in the growing crystals. Within the cooling\nFigure 3.15: Tetrahedral structure of\nolivine. magma, the mineral crystals continue to grow until they solidify into igneous rock.\nThe relative amounts of iron and magnesium in the parent magma determine which\nminerals in the series form. Other rarer elements with similar properties to iron or magnesium, like manganese (Mn), can\nsubstitute into the olivine crystalline structure in small amounts. Such ionic substitutions in mineral crystals give rise to the\ngreat variety of minerals and are often responsible for differences in color and other properties within a group or family of\nminerals. Olivine has a pure iron end-member (called fayalite) and a pure magnesium end-member (called forsterite).\nChemically, olivine is mostly silica, iron, and magnesium and therefore is grouped among the dark-colored ferromagnesian\n(iron=ferro, magnesium=magnesian) or mafic minerals, a contraction of their chemical symbols Ma and Fe. Mafic minerals\nare also referred to as dark-colored ferromagnesian minerals. Ferro means iron and magnesian refers to magnesium. Fer-\nromagnesian silicates tend to be more dense than non-ferromagnesian silicates. This difference in density ends up being MINERALS | 65\nimportant in controlling the behavior of the igneous rocks that are built from these minerals: whether a tectonic plate\nsubducts or not is largely governed by the density of its rocks, which are in turn controlled by the density of the minerals\nthat comprise them.\nThe crystal structure of olivine is built from independent silica tetrahedra. Minerals with independent tetrahedral struc-\ntures are called neosilicates (or orthosilicates). In addition to olivine, other common neosilicate minerals include garnet,\ntopaz, kyanite, and zircon.\nTwo other similar arrangements of tetrahedra are close in structure to the neosilicates and grade toward the next group of\nminerals, the pyroxenes. In a variation on independent tetrahedra called sorosilicates, there are minerals that share one\noxygen between two tetrahedra, and include minerals like pistachio-green epidote, a gemstone. Another variation are the\ncyclosilicates, which as the name suggests, consist of tetrahedral rings, and include gemstones such as beryl, emerald,\naquamarine, and tourmaline\nPyroxene Family\nPyroxene is another family of dark ferromagnesian minerals, typi-\ncally black or dark green in color. Members of the pyroxene family\nhave a complex chemical composition that includes iron, magne-\nsium, aluminum, and other elements bonded to polymerized sil-\nica tetrahedra. Polymers are chains, sheets, or three-dimensional\nstructures, and are formed by multiple tetrahedra covalently\nbonded via their corner oxygen atoms. Pyroxenes are commonly\nfound in mafic igneous rocks such as peridotite, basalt, and gab-\nbro, as well as metamorphic rocks like eclogite and blue schist.\nPyroxenes are built from long, single chains of polymerized silica\nFigure 3.16: Crystals of diopside, a member of\ntetrahedra in which tetrahedra share two corner oxygens. The sil-\nthe pyroxene family.\nica chains are bonded together into the crystal structures by metal\ncations. A common member of the pyroxene family is augite, itself containing several solid solution series\nwith a complex chemical formula (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al,Ti)(Si,Al)2O6 that gives rise to a number of individual mineral\nnames.\nThis single-chain crystalline structure bonds with many elements, which can also freely substitute for each\nother. The generalized chemical composition for pyroxene is XZ(Al,Si)2O6. X represents the ions Na, Ca, Mg,\nor Fe, and Z represents Mg, Fe, or Al. These ions have similar ionic sizes, which allows many possible substitu-\ntions among them. Although the cations may freely substitute for each other in the crystal, they carry different\nionic charges that must be balanced out in the final crystalline structure. For example Na has a charge of +1,\nbut Ca has charge of +2. If a Na+ ion substitutes for a Ca+2 ion, it creates an unequal charge that must be bal-\nanced by other ionic substitutions elsewhere in the crystal. Note that ionic size is more important than ionic\nFigure 3.17:\ncharge for substitutions to occur in solid solution series in crystals.\nSingle\nchain\ntetrahedral\nstructure in\npyroxene. 66 | MINERALS\nAmphibole Family\nAmphibole minerals are built from polymerized double silica\nchains and they are also referred to as inosilicates. Imagine two\npyroxene chains that connect together by sharing a third oxy-\ngen on each tetrahedra. Amphiboles are usually found in\nigneous and metamorphic rocks and typically have a long-\nbladed crystal habit. The most common amphibole, horn-\nblende, is usually black; however, they come in a variety of\ncolors depending on their chemical composition. The meta-\nFigure 3.19: Hornblende crystals.\nmorphic rock, amphibolite, is primarily composed of amphi-\nFigure 3.18: Elongated crystals\nbole minerals.\nof hornblende in orthoclase.\nAmphiboles are composed of iron, magnesium, aluminum, and other cations\nbonded with silica tetrahedra. These dark ferromagnesian minerals are commonly found in gabbro, baslt,\ndiorite, and often form the black specks in granite. Their chemical formula is very complex and generally writ-\nten as (RSi4O11)2, where R represents many different cations. For example, it can also be written more exactly\nas AX2Z5((Si,Al,Ti)8O22)(OH,F,Cl,O)2. In this formula A may be Ca, Na, K, Pb, or blank; X equals Li, Na, Mg, Fe, Mn,\nor Ca; and Z is Li, Na, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Co, Ni, Al, Cr, Mn, V, Ti, or Zr. The substitutions create a wide variety of\ncolors such as green, black, colorless, white, yellow, blue, or brown. Amphibole crystals can also include\nhydroxide ions (OH\u2013), which occurs from an interaction between the growing minerals and water dissolved in\nmagma.\n3.3.2 Sheet Silicates\nFigure\n3.20:\nSheet silicates are built from tetrahedra which share all three of their bot-\nDouble\ntom corner oxygens thus forming sheets of tetrahedra with their top corners chain\navailable for bonding with other atoms. Micas and clays are common types structure.\nof sheet silicates, also known as phyllosilicates. Mica minerals are usually\nfound in igneous and metamorphic rocks, while clay minerals are more often found in\nsedimentary rocks. Two frequently found micas are dark-colored biotite, frequently\nfound in granite, and light-colored muscovite, found in the metamorphic rock called\nschist.\nFigure 3.21: Sheet crystals of biotite\nmica.\nChemically, sheet silicates usually contain sili-\ncon and oxygen in a 2:5 ratio (Si4O10). Micas con-\ntain mostly silica, aluminum, and potassium.\nBiotite mica has more iron and magnesium and\nis considered a ferromagnesian silicate min-\neral. Muscovite micas belong to the felsic sili-\ncate minerals. Felsic is a contraction formed Figure 3.23: Sheet structure of\nfrom feldspar, the dominant mineral in felsic mica.\nrocks.\nFigure 3.22: Crystal of muscovite mica. MINERALS | 67\nThe illustration of the crystalline structure of mica shows the corner O atoms\nbonded with K, Al, Mg, Fe, and Si atoms, forming polymerized sheets of\nlinked tetrahedra, with an octahedral layer of Fe, Mg, or Al, between them.\nThe yellow potassium ions form Van der Waals bonds (attraction and repul-\nsion between atoms, molecules, and surfaces) and hold the sheets together.\nVan der Waals bonds differ from covalent and ionic bonds, and exist here\nbetween the sandwiches, holding them together into a stack of sandwiches.\nThe Van der Waals bonds are weak compared to the bonds within the\nsheets, allowing the sandwiches to be separated along the potassium layers.\nThis gives mica its characteristic property of easily cleaving into sheets.\nFigure 3.24: Crystal structure of a mica.\nFigure 3.25: Mica \u201csilica sandwich\u201d structure. In this analogy, you may start with one\n\u201csandwich\u201d: the top bun is a silica sheet, with a \u201cjam\u201d of anions filling the sandwich.\nThe bottom bun is another silica sheet. Then if you place this sandwich on top of an\nexisting sandwich, you may use butter to hold the two sandwiches together\u2014this\n\u201cbutter\u201d would be the large potassium ions forming Van der Waals bonds that hold\nthe two sandwiches\u2019 bottom and top buns (silica sheets) together.\nClays minerals occur in sediments formed by the weathering of\nrocks and are another family of silicate minerals with a tetrahe-\ndral sheet structure. Clay minerals form a complex family, and\nare an important component of many sedimentary rocks. Other\nsheet silicates include serpentine and chlorite, found in meta-\nmorphic rocks.\nClay minerals are composed of hydrous aluminum silicates.\nOne type of clay, kaolinite, has a structure like an open-faced\nsandwich, with the bread being a single layer of silicon-oxygen\ntetrahedra and a layer of aluminum as the spread in an octahe-\ndral configuration with the top oxygens of the sheets.\nFigure 3.26: Structure of kaolinite. 68 | MINERALS\n3.3.3 Framework Silicates\nQuartz and feldspar are the two most abundant minerals in the continental crust. In\nfact, feldspar itself is the single most abundant mineral in the Earth\u2019s crust. There are\ntwo types of feldspar, one containing potassium and abundant in felsic rocks of the\ncontinental crust, and the other with sodium and calcium abundant in the mafic rocks\nof oceanic crust. Together with quartz, these minerals are classified as framework sil-\nicates. They are built with a three-dimensional framework of silica tetrahedra in which\nall four corner oxygens are shared with adjacent tetrahedra. Within these frameworks\nin feldspar are holes and spaces into which other ions like aluminum, potassium,\nsodium, and calcium can fit giving rise to a variety of mineral compositions and mineral\nnames.\nFigure 3.27: Freely growing quartz\nFeldspars are usually\ncrystals showing crystal faces.\nfound in igneous rocks,\nsuch as granite, rhyolite, and basalt as well as metamor-\nphic rocks and detrital sedimentary rocks. Detrital sedi-\nmentary rocks are composed of mechanically weathered\nrock particles, like sand and gravel. Quartz is especially\nabundant in detrital sedimentary rocks because it is very\nresistant to disintegration by weathering. While quartz is\nthe most abundant mineral on the Earth\u2019s surface, due to\nits durability, the feldspar minerals are the most abundant\nminerals in the Earth\u2019s crust, comprising roughly 50% of\nthe total minerals that make up the crust.\nFigure 3.28: Mineral abundance pie chart in Earth\u2019s crust.\nFigure 3.29: Pink orthoclase crystals.\nQuartz is composed of pure silica, SiO2, with the tetrahedra arranged in a three dimensional framework. Impurities con-\nsisting of atoms within this framework give rise to many varieties of quartz among which are gemstones like amethyst,\nrose quartz, and citrine. Feldspars are mostly silica with aluminum, potassium, sodium, and calcium. Orthoclase feldspar\n(KAlSi3O8), also called potassium feldspar or K-spar, is made of silica, aluminum, and potassium. Quartz and orthoclase\nfeldspar are felsic minerals. Felsic is the compositional term applied to continental igneous minerals and rocks that\ncontain an abundance of silica. Another feldspar is plagioclase with the formula (Ca,Na)AlSi3O8, the solid solution (Ca,Na)\nindicating a series of minerals, one end of the series with calcium CaAl2Si2O8, called anorthite, and the other end with\nsodium NaAlSi3O8, called albite. Note how the mineral accommodates the substitution of Ca++ and Na+. Minerals in this\nsolid solution series have different mineral names. MINERALS | 69\nNote that aluminum, which has a similar ionic size to silicon, can substitute for sili-\ncon inside the tetrahedra. Because potassium ions are so much larger than sodium\nand calcium ions, which are very similar in size, the inability of the crystal lattice to\naccommodate both potassium and sodium/calcium gives rise to the two families\nof feldspar, orthoclase and plagioclase respectively. Framework silicates are\ncalled tectosilicates and include the alkali metal-rich feldspathoids and zeolites.\nFigure 3.30: Crystal structure of feldspar.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 3.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Many non-sili-\ncate minerals are economically important and provide\nmetallic resources such as copper, lead, and iron. They\nalso include valuable non-metallic products such as salt,\nconstruction materials, and fertilizer.\nFigure 3.31: Hanksite, Na22K(SO4)9(CO3)2Cl, one of the few minerals\nthat is considered a carbonate and a sulfate. 70 | MINERALS\nMineral group Examples Formula Uses\nNative elements Gold, silver, copper Au, Ag, Cu Jewelry, coins, industry\nCarbonates Calcite, dolomite CaCO3, CaMg(CO3)2 Lime, Portland cement\nOxides Hematite, magnetite, bauxite Fe2O3, Fe3O4, a mixture of aluminum oxides Ores of iron & aluminum, pigments\nHalides Halite, sylvite NaCl, KCl Table salt, fertilizer\nSulfides Galena, chalcopyrite, cinnabar PbS, CuFeS2, HgS Ores of lead, copper, mercury\nSulphates Gypsum, epsom salts CaSo4 \u00b7 2H2O, MgSO4 \u00b7 7H2O Sheetrock, therapeutic soak\nPhosphates Apatite Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH) Fertilizer, teeth, bones\nTable 3.2: Common non-silicatemineral groups.\n3.4.1 Carbonates\nCalcite (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) are the two\nmost frequently occurring carbonate minerals, and usu-\nally occur in sedimentary rocks, such as limestone and\ndolostone rocks, respectively. Some carbonate rocks,\nsuch calcite and dolomite, are formed via evaporation\nand precipitation. However, most carbonate-rich rocks,\nsuch as limestone, are created by the lithification of fos-\nsilized marine organisms. These organisms, including\nthose we can see and many microscopic organisms, have\nshells or exoskeletons consisting of calcium carbonate\n(CaCO3). When these organisms die, their remains accu- Figure 3.33: Limestone with small\nmulate on the floor of the water body in which they live fossils.\nand the soft body parts decompose and dissolve away.\nFigure 3.32: Calcite crystal in shape\nof rhomb. Note the The calcium carbonate hard parts become included in the sediments, eventually\ndouble-refracted word \u201ccalcite\u201d in\nbecoming the sedimentary rock called limestone. While limestone may contain large,\nthe center of the figure due to\nbirefringence. easy to see fossils, most limestones contain the remains of microscopic creatures and\nthus originate from biological processes.\nCalcite crystals show an interesting property called birefringence, meaning they polar-\nize light into two wave components vibrating at right angles to each other. As the two\nlight waves pass through the crystal, they travel at different velocities and are separated\nby refraction into two different travel paths. In other words, the crystal produces a dou-\nble image of objects viewed through it. Because they polarize light, calcite crystals are\nused in special petrographic microscopes for studying minerals and rocks.\nMany non-silicate minerals are referred to as salts. The term salts used here refers to\ncompounds made by replacing the hydrogen in natural acids. The most abundant nat-\nural acid is carbonic acid that forms by the solution of carbon dioxide in water. Carbon-\nate minerals are salts built around the carbonate ion (CO3-2) where calcium and/or\nFigure 3.34: Bifringence in calcite\nmagnesium replace the hydrogen in carbonic acid (H2CO3). Calcite and a closely\ncrystals.\nrelated polymorph aragonite are secreted by organisms to form shells and physical\nstructures like corals. Many such creatures draw both calcium and carbonate from dissolved bicarbonate ions (HCO3\u2013) in\nocean water. As seen in the mineral identification section below, calcite is easily dissolved in acid and thus effervesces in\ndilute hydrochloric acid (HCl). Small dropper bottles of dilute hydrochloric acid are often carried by geologists in the field\nas well as used in mineral identification labs. MINERALS | 71\nOther salts include halite (NaCl) in which sodium replaces the hydrogen in hydrochlo-\nric acid and gypsum (Ca[SO4] \u2022 2 H2O) in which calcium replaces the hydrogen in sul-\nfuric acid. Note that some water molecules are also included in the gypsum crystal.\nSalts are often formed by evaporation and are called evaporite minerals.\nThe figure shows the crystal structure of calcite (CaCO3). Like silicon, carbon has four\nvalence electrons. The carbonate unit consists of carbon atoms (tiny white dots)\ncovalently bonded to three oxygen atoms (red), one oxygen sharing two valence\nelectrons with the carbon and the other two sharing one valence electron each with\nthe carbon, thus creating triangular units with a charge of -2. The negatively charged\ncarbonate unit forms an ionic bond with the Ca ion (blue), which as a charge of +2.\n3.4.2 Oxides, Halides, and Sulfides\nAfter carbonates, the next most common Figure 3.35: Crystal structure of calcite.\nnon-silicate minerals are the oxides,\nhalides, and sulfides.\nOxides consist of metal ions covalently bonded with oxygen. The most familiar\noxide is rust, which is a combination of iron oxides (Fe2O3) and hydrated oxides.\nHydrated oxides form when iron is exposed to oxygen and water. Iron oxides\nare important for producing metallic iron. When iron oxide or ore is smelted, it\nproduces carbon dioxide (CO2) and metallic iron.\nThe red color in rocks is usually due to the presence of iron oxides. For exam-\nple, the red sandstone cliffs in Zion National Park and throughout Southern\nFigure 3.36: Limonite, a hydrated oxide of iron. Utah consist of white or colorless grains of quartz coated with iron oxide which\nserve as cementing agents holding the grains together.\nOther iron oxides include limonite, magnetite, and hematite. Hematite occurs in\nmany different crystal forms. The massive form shows no external structure.\nBotryoidal hematite shows large concentric blobs. Specular hematite looks like\na mass of shiny metallic crystals. Oolitic hematite looks like a mass of dull red\nfish eggs. These different forms of hematite are polymorphs and all have the\nsame formula, Fe2O3.\nOther common oxide minerals include:\n\u2022 ice (H2O), an oxide of hydrogen\n\u2022 bauxite (Al2H2O4), hydrated oxides of aluminum, an ore for producing\nmetallic aluminum\n\u2022 corundum (Al2O3), which includes ruby and sapphire gemstones.\nFigure 3.37: Oolitic hematite. 72 | MINERALS\nThe halides consist of halogens in column VII, usually fluorine or chlorine,\nionically bonded with sodium or other cations. These include halite or\nsodium chloride (NaCl), common table salt; sylvite or potassium chloride\n(KCl); and fluorite or calcium fluoride (CaF2).\nFigure 3.38: Halite crystal showing cubic habit.\nFigure 3.39: Salt crystals at the Bonneville Salt Flats.\nHalide minerals usually form from the evaporation of sea water or other isolated\nbodies of water. A well-known example of halide mineral deposits created by evap-\noration is the Bonneville Salt Flats, located west of the Great Salt Lake in Utah (see\nfigure 3.39).\nMany important metal ores are sulfides, in which met-\nals are bonded to sulfur. Significant examples include:\ngalena (lead sulfide), sphalerite (zinc sulfide), pyrite\n(iron sulfide, sometimes called \u201cfool\u2019s gold\u201d), and chal-\ncopyrite (iron-copper sulfide). Sulfides are well\nknown for being important ore minerals. For example,\nFigure 3.40: Fluorite. B shows\ngalena is the main source of lead, sphalerite is the fluorescence of fluorite under UV light.\nmain source of zinc, and chalcopyrite is the main cop-\nper ore mineral mined in porphyry deposits like the Bingham mine (see chapter 16). The\nFigure 3.41: Cubic crystals of largest sources of nickel, antimony, molybdenum, arsenic, and mercury are also sulfides.\npyrite.\n3.4.3 Sulfates\nSulfate minerals contain a metal ion, such as calcium, bonded to a sulfate ion. The\nsulfate ion is a combination of sulfur and oxygen (SO4\u20132). The sulfate mineral gyp-\nsum (CaSO4 \u2022 2H2O) is used in construction materials such as plaster and drywall.\nGypsum is often formed from evaporating water and usually contains water mole-\ncules in its crystalline structure. The 2H2O in the formula indicates the water mole-\ncules are whole H2O. This is different from minerals like amphibole, which contain a\nhydroxide ion (OH\u2013) that is derived from water, but is missing a hydrogen ion (H+). The\ncalcium sulfate without water is a different mineral than gypsum called anhydrite\n(CaSO4).\nFigure 3.42: Gypsum crystal. MINERALS | 73\n3.4.4 Phosphates\nPhosphate minerals have a tetrahedral phosphate unit (PO4-3) combined with various anions and\ncations. In some cases arsenic or vanadium can substitute for phosphorus. Phosphates are an\nimportant ingredient of fertilizers as well as detergents, paint, and other products. The best known\nphosphate mineral is apatite, Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH), variations of which are found in teeth and bones.\nThe gemstone turquoise [CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8\u00b74H2O ] is a copper-rich phosphate mineral that, like\ngypsum, contains water molecules.\nFigure 3.43: Apatite\ncrystal.\n3.4.5 Native Element Minerals\nNative element minerals, usually metals, occur in\nnature in a pure or nearly pure state. Gold is an\nexample of a native element mineral; it is not very\nreactive and rarely bonds with other elements so it\nis usually found in an isolated or pure state. The\nnon-metallic and poorly-reactive mineral carbon is\noften found as a native element, such as graphite\nand diamonds. Mildly reactive metals like silver,\ncopper, platinum, mercury, and sulfur sometimes\nFigure 3.44: Native sulfur deposited occur as native element minerals. Reactive metals Figure 3.45: Native copper.\naround a volcanic fumarole. such as iron, lead, and aluminum almost always\nbond to other elements and are rarely found in a native state.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 3.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In the field,\nwhere geologists may have limited access to advanced technology and\npowerful machines, they can still identify minerals by testing several\nphysical properties: luster and color, streak, hardness, crystal habit,\ncleavage and fracture, and some special properties. Only a few common\nminerals make up the majority of Earth\u2019s rocks and are usually seen as\nsmall grains in rocks. Of the several properties used for identifying miner-\nals, it is good to consider which will be most useful for identifying them in\nsmall grains surrounded by other minerals.\n3.5.1 Luster and Color\nThe first thing to notice\nabout a mineral is its\nFigure 3.46: The rover Curiosity drilled a hole in this\nsurface appearance, rock from Mars, and confirmed the mineral hematite,\nas mapped from satellites.\nspecifically luster and\ncolor. Luster describes\nhow the mineral looks. Metallic luster looks like a shiny metal such as\nchrome, steel, silver, or gold. Submetallic luster has a duller appear-\nance. Pewter, for example, shows submetallic luster.\nFigure 3.47: 15 mm metallic hexagonal molybdenite\ncrystal from Quebec.\nNonmetallic luster doesn\u2019t look like a metal and may be\ndescribed as vitreous (glassy), earthy, silky, pearly, and\nother surface qualities. Nonmetallic minerals may be\nshiny, although their vitreous shine is different from metal-\nlic luster. See the table for descriptions and examples of\nnonmetallic luster.\nFigure 3.48: Submetallic luster shown on an antique pewter plate.

Submetallic appearance can showing\noccur in metallic minerals because of weathering. submetallic\nluster\nTable 3.3: Nonmetallic luster descriptions and examples.\nSurface color may be helpful in identifying minerals, although it can be quite variable\nwithin the same mineral family. Mineral colors are affected by the main elements as well\nas impurities in the crystals. These impurities may be rare elements\u2014like manganese,\ntitanium, chromium, or lithium\u2014even other molecules that are not normally part of the\nmineral formula. For example, the incorporation of water molecules gives quartz, which\nis normally clear, a milky color.\nSome minerals predominantly show a single color. Malachite and azurite are green and\nblue, respectively, because of their copper content. Other minerals have a predictable\nrange of colors due to elemental substitutions, usually via a solid solution. Feldspars,\nthe most abundant minerals in the earth\u2019s crust, are complex, have solid solution series,\nand present several colors including pink, white, green, gray and others. Other minerals\nFigure 3.49: Azurite is ALWAYS a also come in several colors, influenced by trace amounts of several elements. The same\ndark blue color, and has been used\nelement may show up as different colors, in different minerals. With notable exceptions,\nfor centuries for blue pigment. 76 | MINERALS\ncolor is usually not a definitive property of minerals. For identifying many minerals. a more reliable indicator is streak,\nwhich is the color of the powdered mineral.\n3.5.2 Streak\nStreak examines the color of a powdered mineral, and can be\nseen when a mineral sample is scratched or scraped on an\nunglazed porcelain streak plate. A paper page in a field note-\nbook may also be used for the streak of some minerals. Miner-\nals that are harder than the streak plate will not show streak,\nbut will scratch the porcelain. For these minerals, a streak test\ncan be obtained by powdering the mineral with a hammer and\nsmearing the powder across a streak plate or notebook paper.\nWhile mineral surface colors and appearances may vary, their\nstreak colors can be diagnostically useful. An example of this\nproperty is seen in the iron-oxide mineral hematite. Hematite\noccurs in a variety of forms, colors and lusters, from shiny metal-\nlic silver to earthy red-brown, and different physical appear-\nances. A hematite streak is consistently reddish brown, no Figure 3.50: Different minerals may have different streaks.\nmatter what the original specimen looks like. Iron sulfide or\npyrite, is a brassy metallic yellow. Commonly named fool\u2019s gold, pyrite has a characteristic black to greenish-black streak.\n3.5.3 Hardness\nFigure 3.51: Mohs hardness scale. MINERALS | 77\nHardness measures the ability of a mineral to scratch other substances. The Mohs Hardness Scale gives a number show-\ning the relative scratch-resistance of minerals when compared to a standardized set of minerals of increasing hardness.\nThe Mohs scale was developed by German geologist Fredrick Mohs in the early 20th century, although the idea of iden-\ntifying minerals by hardness goes back thousands of years. Mohs hardness values are determined by the strength of a\nmineral\u2019s atomic bonds.\nThe figure shows the minerals associated with specific hardness values, together with some common items readily avail-\nable for use in field testing and mineral identification. The hardness values run from 1 to 10, with 10 being the hardest;\nhowever, the scale is not linear. Diamond defines a hardness of 10 and is actually about four times harder than corundum,\nwhich is 9. A steel pocketknife blade, which has a hardness value of 5.5, separates between hard and soft minerals on\nmany mineral identification keys.\n3.5.4 Crystal Habit\nMinerals can be identified by crystal habit, how their crystals grow and appear in rocks. Crystal shapes are determined\nby the arrangement of the atoms within the crystal structure. For example, a cubic arrangement of atoms gives rise to a\ncubic-shaped mineral crystal. Crystal habit refers to typically observed shapes and characteristics; however, they can be\naffected by other minerals crystallizing in the same rock. When minerals are constrained so they do not develop their typ-\nical crystal habit, they are called anhedral. Subhedral crystals are partially formed shapes. For some minerals character-\nistic crystal habit is to grow crystal faces even when surrounded by other crystals in rock. An example is garnet. Minerals\ngrown freely where the crystals are unconstrained and can take characteristic shapes often form crystal faces. A euhedral\ncrystal has a perfectly formed, unconstrained shape. Some minerals crystallize in such tiny crystals, they do not show a\nspecific crystal habit to the naked eye. Other minerals, like pyrite, can have an array of different crystal habits, including\ncubic, dodecahedral, octahedral, and massive. The table lists typical crystal habits of various minerals. 78 | MINERALS\nHabit Image Examples\nKyanite\nBladed\nKyanite, amphibole, gypsum\nLong and flat crystals\nMalchite\nBotryoidal/mammillary Hematite, malachite,\nBlobby, circular crystals smithsonite\nQuartz\n(var. amethyst)\ngeode\nCoating/laminae/druse Quartz, calcite, malachite,\nCrystals that are small and coat surfaces azurite\nCalcite,\nGalena\nCubic\nPyrite, galena, halite\nCube-shaped crystals\nPyrite\nDodecahedral\nGarnet, pyrite\n12-sided polygon shapes\nManganese\ndendrites,\nscale in mm\nDendritic\nMn-oxides, copper, gold\nBranching crystals MINERALS | 79\nHabit Image Examples\nOlivine\nEquant\nOlivine, garnet, pyroxene\nCrystals that do not have a long direction\nTremolite,\na type of\namphibole\nFibrous\nSerpentine, amphibole, zeolite\nThin, very long crystals\nMuscovite\nLayered, sheets\nMica (biotite, muscovite, etc.)\nStacked, very thin, flat crystals\nOrange\nwulfenite\non calcite\nLenticular/platy Selenite roses, wulfenite,\nCrystals that are plate-like calcite\nHanksite\nHexagonal\nQuartz, hanksite, corundum\nCrystals with six sides\nLimonite,\na\nhydrated\nMassive/granular oxide of\nLimonite, pyrite, azurite,\nCrystals with no obvious shape, microscopic iron\nbornite\ncrystals 80 | MINERALS\nHabit Image Examples\nFluorite\nOctahedral Diamond, fluorite, magnetite,\n4-sided double pyramid crystals pyrite\nTourmaline\nvar.

MINERALS | 81\nAnother crystal habit that may be\nused to identify minerals is striations,\nwhich are dark and light parallel lines\non a crystal face. Twinning is another,\nwhich occurs when the crystal struc-\nture replicates in mirror images along\ncertain directions in the crystal.\nFigure 3.53: Twinned staurolite found at Fairy\nStone State Park, located in Patrick County,\nVirginia.\nFigure 3.52: Gypsum with striations.\nStriations and twinning are related properties in some minerals including pla-\ngioclase feldspar. Striations are optical lines on a cleavage surface. Because of\ntwinning in the crystal, striations show up on one of the two cleavage faces of\nthe plagioclase crystal.\n3.5.5 Cleavage and Fracture\nMinerals often show characteris-\ntic patterns of breaking along\nFigure 3.54: Striations on plagioclase.\nspecific cleavage planes or show\ncharacteristic fracture patterns. Cleavage planes are smooth, flat, parallel\nplanes within the crystal. The cleavage planes may show as reflective sur-\nfaces on the crystal, as parallel cracks that penetrate into the crystal, or show\non the edge or side of the crystal as a series of steps like rice terraces.\nCleavage arises in crystals where the atomic bonds between atomic layers\nare weaker along some directions than others, meaning they will break pref-\nerentially along these planes. Because they develop on atomic surfaces in\nthe crystal, cleavage planes are optically smooth and reflect light, although\nFigure 3.55: Citrine, a variety of quartz showing\nconchoidal fracture. the actual break on the crystal may appear jagged or uneven. In such cleav-\nages, the cleavage surface may appear like rice terraces on a mountainside\nthat all reflect sunlight from a particular sun angle. Some minerals have a strong cleavage, some minerals only have weak\ncleavage or do not typically demonstrate cleavage. 82 | MINERALS\nFor example, quartz and olivine rarely show cleavage and typically break\ninto conchoidal fracture patterns.\nGraphite has its carbon atoms arranged into layers with relatively strong\nbonds within the layer and very weak bonds between the layers. Thus\ngraphite cleaves readily between the layers and the layers slide easily\nover one another giving graphite its lubricating quality.\nMineral fracture surfaces may be\nrough and uneven or they may be\nshow conchoidal fracture.\nUneven fracture patterns are\nFigure 3.56: Graphite showing layers of carbon atoms described as irregular, splintery,\nseparated by a gap with weak bonds holding the\nfibrous. A conchoidal fracture has\nlayers together.\na smooth, curved surface like a\nshallow bowl or conch shell, often with curved ridges. Natural volcanic glass,\ncalled obsidian, breaks with this characteristic conchoidal pattern.\nTo work with cleavage, it is important to remember that cleavage is a result of Figure 3.57: Cubic cleavage of galena; note\nbonds separating along planes of atoms in the crystal structure. On some minerals, how the cleavage surfaces show up as\ndifferent but parallel layers in the crystal.\ncleavage planes may be confused with crystal faces. This will usually not be an\nissue for crystals of minerals that grew together within rocks. The act of breaking\nthe rock to expose a fresh face will most likely break the crystals along cleavage planes. Some cleavage planes are parallel\nwith crystal faces but many are not. Cleavage planes are smooth, flat, parallel planes within the crystal. The cleavage\nplanes may show as parallel cracks that penetrate into the crystal (see amphibole below), or show on the edge or side of\nthe crystal as a series of steps like rice terraces. For some minerals characteristic crystal habit is to grow crystal faces\neven when surrounded by other crystals in rock. An example is garnet. Minerals grown freely where the crystals are uncon-\nstrained and can take characteristic shapes often form crystal faces (see quartz below).\nIn some minerals, distinguishing cleavage planes from crystal faces\nmay be challenging for the student. Understanding the nature of cleav-\nage and referring to the number of cleavage planes and cleavage\nangles on identification keys should provide the student with enough\ninformation to distinguish cleavages from crystal faces. Cleavage planes\nmay show as multiple parallel cracks or flat surfaces on the crystal.\nCleavage planes may be expressed as a series of steps like terraced rice\npaddies. See the cleavage surfaces on galena above or plagioclase\nbelow. Cleavage planes arise from the tendency of mineral crystals to\nbreak along specific planes of weakness within the crystal favored by\natomic arrangements. The number of cleavage planes, the quality of the\ncleavage surfaces, and the angles between them are diagnostic for\nmany minerals and cleavage is one of the most useful properties for\nidentifying minerals. Learning to recognize cleavage is an especially\nFigure 3.58: Freely growing quartz crystals showing important and useful skill in studying minerals.\ncrystal faces. MINERALS | 83\nAs an identification property of minerals, cleavage is usually\ngiven in terms of the quality of the cleavage (perfect, imperfect,\nor none), the number of cleavage surfaces, and the angles\nbetween the surfaces. The most common number of cleavage\nplane directions in the common rock-forming minerals are: one\nperfect cleavage (as in mica), two cleavage planes (as in\nfeldspar, pyroxene, and amphibole), and three cleavage planes\n(as in halite, calcite, and galena). One perfect cleavage (as in\nmica) develops on the top and bottom of the mineral specimen\nwith many parallel cracks showing on the sides but no angle of\nintersection. Two cleavage planes intersect at an angle. Com-\nmon cleavage angles are 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 120\u00b0. Amphibole has\ntwo cleavage planes at 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0. Galena and halite have\nthree cleavage planes at 90\u00b0 (cubic cleavage). Calcite cleaves\nFigure 3.59: Steps of cleavage along the same cleavage direction.\nreadily in three directions producing a cleavage figure called a\nrhomb that looks like a cube squashed over toward one corner giving rise to the approximately 75\u00b0 cleavage angles.

Ulexite has a fiber-optic prop-\nerty that can project images through the crystal like a high-\ndefinition television screen (see figure 3.61). A simple identifying\nspecial property is taste, such as the salty flavor of halite or com-\nmon table salt (NaCl). Sylvite is potassium chloride (KCl) and has a\nmore bitter taste.\nFigure 3.61: A demonstration of ulexite\u2019s image projection. 84 | MINERALS\nAnother property geologists may use to identify minerals is a property related\nto density called specific gravity. Specific gravity measures the weight of a\nmineral specimen relative to the weight of an equal volume of water. The\nvalue is expressed as a ratio between the mineral and water weights. To mea-\nsure specific gravity, a mineral specimen is first weighed in grams then sub-\nmerged in a graduated cylinder filled with pure water at room temperature.\nThe rise in water level is noted using the cylinder\u2019s graduated scale. Since the\nweight of water at room temperature is 1 gram per cubic centimeter, the ratio\nof the two weight numbers gives the specific gravity. Specific gravity is easy\nto measure in the laboratory but is less useful for mineral identification in the\nfield than other more easily observed properties, except in a few rare cases\nsuch as the very dense galena or native gold. The high density of these min-\nerals gives rise to a qualitative property called \u201cheft.\u201d Experienced geologists\ncan roughly assess specific gravity by heft, a subjective quality of how heavy\nthe specimen feels in one\u2019s hand relative to its size.\nA simple test for identifying calcite and dolomite is to drop a bit of dilute\nhydrochloric acid (10-15% HCl) on the specimen. If the acid drop effervesces or\nfizzes on the surface of the rock, the specimen is calcite. If it does not, the Figure 3.62: Native gold has one of the highest\nspecific gravities.\nspecimen is scratched to produce a small amount of powder and test with acid\nagain. If the acid drop fizzes slowly on the powdered mineral, the specimen is\ndolomite. The difference between these two minerals can be seen in the video. Geologists who work with carbonate rocks\ncarry a small dropper bottle of dilute HCl in their field kit. Vinegar, which contains acetic acid, can be used for this test and\nis used to distinguish non-calcite fossils from limestone. While acidic, vinegar produces less of a fizzing reaction because\nacetic acid is a weaker acid.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

MINERALS | 85\nSome iron-oxide minerals are magnetic and are attracted to magnets. A\ncommon name for a naturally magnetic iron oxide is lodestone. Others\ninclude magnetite (Fe3O4) and ilmenite (FeTiO3). Magnetite is strongly\nattracted to magnets and can be magnetized. Ilmenite and some types\nof hematite are weakly magnetic.\nSome minerals and miner-\naloids scatter light via a\nphenomenon called irides-\ncence. This property occurs\nin labradorite (a variety of\nFigure 3.63: Paperclips attach to lodestone (magnetite). plagioclase) and opal. It is\nalso seen in biologically\ncreated substances like pearls and seashells. Cut diamonds show iridescence\nand the jeweler\u2019s diamond cut is designed to maximize this property.\nStriations on mineral\nFigure 3.64: Iridescence on plagioclase, also\ncleavage faces are an opti-\nshowing striations on the cleavage surface.\ncal property that can be\nused to separate plagioclase feldspar from potassium feldspar (K-\nspar). A process called twinning creates parallel zones in the crystal that\nare repeating mirror images. The actual cleavage angle in plagioclase\nis slightly different than 90o and the alternating mirror images in these\ntwinned zones produce a series of parallel lines on one of plagioclase\u2019s\ntwo cleavage faces. Light reflects off these twinned lines at slightly dif-\nferent angles which then appear as light and dark lines called striations\non the cleavage surface. Potassium feldspar does not exhibit twinning\nFigure 3.65: Exsolution lamellae within potassium\nor striations but may show linear features called exsolution lamellae,\nfeldspar.\nalso known as perthitic lineation or simply perthite. Because sodium\nand potassium do not fit into the same feldspar crystal structure, the lines are created by small amounts of sodium\nfeldspar (albite) separating from the dominant potassium feldspar (K-spar) within the crystal structure. The two different\nfeldspars crystallize out into roughly parallel zones within the crystal, which are seen as these linear markings.\nOne of the most interesting special mineral properties is fluorescence. Certain\nminerals, or trace elements within them, give off visible light when exposed to\nultraviolet radiation or black light. Many mineral exhibits have a fluorescence room\nequipped with black lights so this property can be observed. An even rarer optical\nproperty is phosphorescence. Phosphorescent minerals absorb light and then\nslowly release it, much like a glow-in-the-dark sticker.\nFigure 3.66: Fluorite. B shows fluorescence\nof fluorite under UV light. 86 | MINERALS\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 3.5 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Mineral properties are determined by\ntheir atomic bonds. Most minerals begin in a fluid, and either crystallize out of cooling magma or precipitate as ions and\nmolecules out of a saturated solution. The silicates are largest group of minerals on Earth, by number of varieties and\nrelative quantity, making up a large portion of the crust and mantle. Based on the silicon-oxygen tetrahedra, the crystal\nstructure of silicates reflects the fact that silicon and oxygen are the top two of Earth\u2019s most abundant elements. Non-sil-\nicate minerals are also economically important, and providing many types of construction and manufacturing materials.\nMinerals are identified by their unique physical properties, including luster, color, streak, hardness, crystal habit, frac-\nture, cleavage, and special properties.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This molten material is called magma when it is in the\nground and lava when it is on the surface. Only the Earth\u2019s outer core is liquid; the Earth\u2019s mantle and crust is naturally\nsolid. However, there are a few minor pockets of magma that form near the surface where geologic processes cause melt-\ning. It is this magma that becomes the source for volcanoes and igneous rocks. This chapter will describe the classification\nof igneous rocks, the unique processes that form magmas, types of volcanoes and volcanic processes, volcanic hazards,\nand igneous landforms.\nLava cools quickly on the surface of the earth and forms tiny microscopic crys-\ntals. These are known as fine-grained extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rocks.\nExtrusive rocks are often vesicular, filled with holes from escaping gas bub-\nbles. Volcanism is the process in which lava is erupted. Depending on the\nproperties of the lava that is erupted, the volcanism can be drastically differ-\nent, from smooth and gentle to dangerous and explosive. This leads to differ-\nent types of volcanoes and different volcanic hazards.\nIn contrast, magma that cools\nFigure 4.1: Lava flow in Hawai\u2019i. slowly below the earth\u2019s surface\nforms larger crystals which can\nbe seen with the naked eye. These are known as coarse-grained intrusive,\nor plutonic, igneous rocks. This relationship between cooling rates and grain\nsizes of the solidified minerals in igneous rocks is important for interpreting\nthe rock\u2019s geologic history.\n4.1 Classification of Igneous Rocks\nFigure 4.2: Half Dome, an intrusive igneous\nIgneous rocks are classified based on texture and composition.

This IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 93\nrelates to the cooling history of the molten magma from which it came. Composition refers to the rock\u2019s specific mineral-\nogy and chemical composition. Cooling history is also related to changes that can occur to the composition of igneous\nrocks.\n4.1.1 Texture\nIf magma cools slowly, deep within the crust, the resulting rock is called intru-\nsive or plutonic. The slow cooling process allows crystals to grow large, giving\nintrusive igneous rock a coarse-grained or phaneritic texture. The individual\ncrystals in phaneritic texture are readily visible to the unaided eye.\nWhen lava is extruded onto the surface, or intruded\ninto shallow fissures near the surface and cools, the\nresulting igneous rock is called extrusive or vol-\ncanic. Extrusive igneous rocks have a fine-grained or\nFigure 4.3: Granite is a classic coarse-grained\naphanitic texture, in which the grains are too small to\n(phaneritic) intrusive igneous rock.

This is a common component of volcanic\nash and rocks like obsidian.\nSome igneous rocks have a mix of coarse-grained minerals surrounded by a matrix of\nfine-grained material in a texture called porphyritic. The large crystals are called phe-\nnocrysts and the fine-grained matrix is called the groundmass or matrix. Porphyritic\ntexture indicates the magma body underwent a multi-stage cooling history, cooling\nslowly while deep under the surface and later rising to a shallower depth or the surface\nwhere it cooled more quickly.\nResidual molten material expelled from igneous\nFigure 4.5: Porphyritic texture. intrusions may form veins or masses containing\nvery large crystals of minerals like feldspar,\nquartz, beryl, tourmaline, and mica. This texture, which indicates a very slow crys-\ntallization, is called pegmatitic. A rock that chiefly consists of pegmatitic texture is\nknown as a pegmatite. To give an example of how large these crystals can get, trans-\nparent cleavage sheets of pegmatitic muscovite mica were used as windows dur-\ning the Middle Ages.\nFigure 4.6: Pegmatitic texture.\nAll magmas contain gases dissolved in solution\ncalled volatiles. As the magma rises to the surface, the drop in pressure causes the dis-\nsolved volatiles to come bubbling out of solution, like the fizz in an opened bottle of soda.\nThe gas bubbles become trapped in the solidifying lava to create a vesicular texture, with\nthe holes specifically called vesicles. The type of volcanic rock with common vesicles is\ncalled scoria.\nFigure 4.7: Scoria. 94 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nAn extreme version of scoria occurs when volatile-rich lava is very quickly quenched and\nbecomes a meringue-like froth of glass called pumice. Some pumice is so full of vesi-\ncles that the density of the rock drops low enough that it will float.\nLava that cools extremely quickly may not\nform crystals at all, even microscopic ones.\nThe resulting rock is called volcanic glass.\nObsidian is a rock consisting of volcanic\nglass. Obsidian as a glassy rock shows an\nexcellent example of conchoidal fracture\nsimilar to the mineral quartz (see chapter\nFigure 4.8: Pumice.\n3).\nWhen volcanoes erupt explo-\nFigure 4.9: Obsidian (volcanic glass). Note sively, vast amounts of lava,\nconchoidal fracture. rock, ash, and gases are\nthrown into the atmosphere.\nThe solid parts, called tephra, settle back to earth and cool into rocks with\npyroclastic textures. Pyro, meaning fire, refers to the igneous source of the\ntephra and clastic refers to the rock fragments. Tephra fragments are\nnamed based on size\u2014ash (<2 mm), lapilli (2-64 mm), and bombs or blocks\n(>64 mm). Pyroclastic texture is usually recognized by the chaotic mix of\ncrystals, angular glass shards, and rock fragments. Rock formed from large\ndeposits of tephra fragments is called tuff. If the fragments accumulate\nFigure 4.10: Welded tuff.\nwhile still hot, the heat may deform the crystals and weld the mass\ntogether, forming a welded tuff.\n4.1.2 Composition\nComposition refers to a rock\u2019s chemical and mineral make-up . For igneous rock, composition is divided into four groups:\nfelsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic. These groups refer to differing amounts of silica, iron, and magnesium found\nin the minerals that make up the rocks. It is important to realize these groups do not have sharp boundaries in nature,\nbut rather lie on a continuous spectrum with many transitional compositions and names that refer to specific quantities of\nminerals. As an example, granite is a commonly-used term, but has a very specific definition which includes exact quan-\ntities of minerals like feldspar and quartz. Rocks labeled as \u2018granite\u2018 in laymen applications can be several other rocks,\nincluding syenite, tonalite, and monzonite. To avoid these complications, the following figure presents a simplified version\nof igneous rock nomenclature focusing on the four main groups, which is adequate for an introductory student. IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 95\nFelsic refers to a predominance of the light-colored (felsic) miner-\nals feldspar and silica in the form of quartz. These light-colored min-\nerals have more silica as a proportion of their overall chemical formula.\nMinor amounts of dark-colored (mafic) minerals like amphibole and\nbiotite mica may be present as well. Felsic igneous rocks are rich in sil-\nica (in the 65-75% range, meaning the rock would be 65-75% weight\npercent SiO2) and poor in iron and magnesium.\nIntermediate is a composition between felsic and mafic. It usually\ncontains roughly-equal amounts of light and dark minerals, including\nlight grains of plagioclase feldspar and dark minerals like amphibole.\nIt is intermediate in silica in the 55-60% range.\nFigure 4.11: Mineral composition of common igneous\nrocks. Percentage of minerals is shown on the vertical\nMafic refers to a abundance of ferromagnesian minerals (with magne-\naxis.

It is mostly made of dark minerals like pyroxene and olivine, compositions grading from one into another.\nwhich are rich in iron and magnesium and relatively poor in silica. Mafic\nrocks are low in silica, in the 45-50% range.\nUltramafic refers to the extremely mafic rocks composed of mostly olivine and some pyroxene which have even more\nmagnesium and iron and even less silica. These rocks are rare on the surface, but make up peridotite, the rock of the\nupper mantle. It is poor in silica, in the 40% or less range.\nOn the figure above, the top row has both plutonic and volcanic igneous rocks arranged in a continuous spectrum from\nfelsic on the left to intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic toward the right. Rhyolite thus refers to the volcanic and felsic\nigneous rocks, and granite thus refer to intrusive and felsic igneous rocks. Andesite and diorite likewise refer to extru-\nsive and intrusive intermediate rocks (with dacite and granodiorite applying to those rocks with composition between\nfelsic and intermediate). Basalt and gabbro are the extrusive and intrusive names for mafic igneous rocks, and peri-\ndotite is ultramafic, with komatiite as the fine-grained extrusive equivalent. Komatiite is a rare rock because volcanic\nmaterial that comes direct from the mantle is not common, although some examples can be found in ancient Archean\nrocks. Nature rarely has sharp boundaries and the classification and naming of rocks often imposes what appear to be\nsharp boundary names onto a continuous spectrum.\nFigure 4.12: Igneous rock classification table with composition as vertical\ncolumns and texture as horizontal rows. 96 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nAphanitic/phaneritic rock types\nFelsic composition\nGranite Rhyolite\nGranite is a course-crystalline felsic intrusive rock.

Gabbro is a major component of the\nEarth\u2019s surface, making up the entirety of the ocean floor (except\nlower oceanic crust.\nwhere covered by sediment).\nTable 4.1: Aphanitic and phaneritic rock types with images.\n4.1.3 Igneous Rock Bodies\nIgneous rocks are common in the geologic record, but surprisingly, it is the intrusive rocks that are more common. Extru-\nsive rocks, because of their small crystals and glass, are less durable. Plus, they are, by definition, exposed to the elements\nof erosion immediately. Intrusive rocks, forming underground with larger, stronger crystals, are more likely to last. There-\nfore, most landforms and rock groups that owe their origin to igneous rocks are intrusive bodies. A significant exception IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 97\nto this is active volcanoes, which are discussed in a later section on volcanism. This section will focus on the common\nigneous bodies which are found in many places within the bedrock of Earth.\nWhen magma intrudes into a weakness like a crack or fissure and solid-\nifies, the resulting cross-cutting feature is called a dike (sometimes\nspelled dyke). Because of this, dikes are often vertical or at an angle\nrelative to the pre-existing rock layers that they intersect. Dikes are\ntherefore discordant intrusions, not following any layering that was pre-\nsent. Dikes are important to geologists, not only for the study of\nigneous rocks themselves but also for dating rock sequences and\ninterpreting the geologic history of an area. The dike is younger than\nthe rocks it cuts across and, as discussed in the chapter on Geologic\nTime (chapter 7), may be used to assign actual numeric ages to sedi-\nmentary sequences, which are notoriously difficult to age date. Figure 4.13: Dike of olivine gabbro cuts across Baffin\nIsland in the Canadian Arctic.\nSills are another type of\nintrusive structure. A sill is a concordant intrusion that runs parallel to the sedi-\nmentary layers in the country rock. They are formed when magma exploits a\nweakness between these layers, shouldering them apart and squeezing\nbetween them. As with dikes, sills are younger than the surrounding layers and\nmay be radioactively dated to study the age of sedimentary strata.\nFigure 4.14: Igneous sill intruding between\nPaleozoic strata in Nova Scotia.\nA magma chamber is a large underground reservoir of\nmolten rock. The path of rising magma is called a diapir. The\nprocesses by which a diapir intrudes into the surrounding\nnative or country rock are not well understood and are the\nsubject of ongoing geological inquiry. For example, it is not\nknown what happens to the pre-existing country rock as the\ndiapir intrudes. One theory is the overriding rock gets shoul-\ndered aside, displaced by the increased volume of magma.\nAnother is the native rock is melted and consumed into the\nrising magma or broken into pieces that settle into the\nmagma, a process known as stoping. It has also been pro-\nposed that diapirs are not a real phenomenon, but just a\nseries of dikes that blend into each other. The dikes may be Figure 4.15: Quartz monzonite in the Cretaceous of Montana, USA.\nintruding over millions of years, but since they may be made\nof similar material, they would be appearing to be formed at the same time. Regardless, when a diapir cools, it forms an\nmass of intrusive rock called a pluton. Plutons can have irregular shapes, but can often be somewhat round. 98 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nWhen many plutons merge together in an extensive single feature, it is called a\nbatholith. Batholiths are found in the cores of many mountain ranges, including\nthe granite formations of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada of Califor-\nnia. They are typically more than 100 km2 in area, associated with subduction\nzones, and mostly felsic in composition. A stock is a type of pluton with less\nsurface exposure than a batholith, and may represent a narrower neck of mate-\nrial emerging from the top of a batholith. Batholiths and stocks are discordant\nintrusions that cut across and through surrounding country rock.\nLaccoliths are blister-like, con-\nFigure 4.16: Half Dome in Yosemite National cordant intrusions of magma\nPark, California, is a part of the Sierra Nevada that form between sedimentary\nbatholith which is mostly made of granite.\nlayers.

Higher temperature minerals shown at top (olivine) and\nlower temperature minerals shown at bottom (quartz).\nBowen\u2019s Reaction Series describes the temperature at which minerals crystallize when\ncooled, or melt when heated. The low end of the temperature scale where all minerals\ncrystallize into solid rock, is approximately 700\u00b0C (1292\u00b0F). The upper end of the range where\nall minerals exist in a molten state, is approximately 1,250\u00b0C (2,282\u00b0F). These numbers refer-\nence minerals that crystallize at standard sea-level pressure, 1 bar. The values will be differ-\nent for minerals located deep below the Earth\u2019s surface due to the increased pressure, which\naffects crystallization and melting temperatures. However, the order and relationships are\nmaintained.\nIn the figure, the righthand column lists the four groups of igneous rock from top to bottom:\nultramafic, mafic, intermediate, and felsic. The down-pointing arrow on the far right shows\nFigure 4.20: Olivine, the first\nmineral to crystallize in a melt. increasing amounts of silica, sodium, aluminum, and potassium as the mineral composition\ngoes from ultramafic to felsic. The up-pointing arrow shows increasing ferromagnesian\ncomponents, specifically iron, magnesium, and calcium. To the far left of the diagram is a temperature scale. Minerals\nnear the top of diagram, such as olivine and anorthite (a type of plagioclase), crystallize at higher temperatures. Minerals\nnear the bottom, such as quartz and muscovite, crystalize at lower temperatures. 100 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nThe most important aspect of Bowen's Reaction Series is to notice the relationships\nbetween minerals and temperature. Norman L. Bowen (1887-1956) was an early 20th Cen-\ntury geologist who studied igneous rocks. He noticed that in igneous rocks, certain minerals\nalways occur together and these mineral assemblages exclude other minerals. Curious as\nto why, and with the hypothesis in mind that it had to do with the temperature at which the\nrocks cooled, he set about conducting experiments on igneous rocks in the early 1900s. He\nconducted experiments on igneous rock\u2014grinding combinations of rocks into powder, seal-\ning the powders into metal capsules, heating them to various temperatures, and then cooling\nthem.\nWhen he opened the quenched capsules,\nhe found a glass surrounding mineral crys-\ntals that he could identify under his petro-\ngraphic microscope. The results of many of\nFigure 4.21: Norman L. Bowen.\nthese experiments, conducted at different\ntemperatures over a period of several years, showed that the common\nigneous minerals crystallize from magma at different temperatures. He\nalso saw that minerals occur together in rocks with others that crystallize\nwithin similar temperature ranges, and never crystallize with other miner-\nals. This relationship can explain the main difference between mafic and\nfelsic igneous rocks. Mafic igneous rocks contain more mafic minerals,\nand therefore, crystallize at higher temperatures than felsic igneous rocks.\nThis is even seen in lava flows, with felsic lavas erupting hundreds of\nFigure 4.22: Norman L.

The melt is made of ions from minerals that have\nliquefied. The solids are made of crystallized minerals floating in the liquid melt. These may be minerals that have already\ncooled Volatiles are gaseous components\u2014such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur, and chlorine\u2014dissolved in the\nmagma. The presence and amount of these three components affect the physical behavior of the magma and will be dis-\ncussed more below. IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 101\n4.3.1 Geothermal Gradient\nBelow the surface, the temperature of the Earth rises. This heat is caused by\nresidual heat left from the formation of Earth and ongoing radioactive decay.\nThe rate at which temperature increases with depth is called the geothermal\ngradient. The average geothermal gradient in the upper 100 km (62 mi) of the\ncrust is about 25\u00b0C per kilometer of depth. So for every kilometer of depth, the\ntemperature increases by about 25\u00b0C.\nThe depth-temperature graph\n(see figure 4.23) illustrates the\nrelationship between the geot-\nhermal gradient (geotherm, red\nline) and the start of rock melting\n(solidus, green line). The geot-\nFigure 4.23: Geothermal gradient. hermal gradient changes with\ndepth (which has a direct rela-\ntionship to pressure) through the crust into upper mantle.

At these pressures and temperatures, the crust and mantle are\nsolid. To a depth of 150 km (93 mi), the geothermal gradient line stays to\nthe left of the solidus line. This relationship continues through the mantle to the core\u2013mantle boundary, at 2,880 km (1,790\nmi).\nThe solidus line slopes to the right because the melting temperature of any substance depends on pressure. The higher\npressure created at greater depth increases the temperature needed to melt rock. In another example, at sea level with\nan atmospheric pressure close to 1 bar, water boils at 100\u00b0C. But if the pressure is lowered, as shown on the video below,\nwater boils at a much lower temperature.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The Bowen\u2019s Reaction Series shows that minerals\nmelt at different temperatures. Since magma is a mixture of different minerals, the solidus boundary is more of a fuzzy\nzone rather than a well-defined line; some minerals are melted and some remain solid. This type of rock behavior is called\npartial melting and represents real-world magmas, which typically contain solid, liquid, and volatile components.\n4.4 Volcanism\nWhen magma emerges onto the Earth\u2019s surface, the molten rock is called lava. A volcano is a type of land formation\ncreated when lava solidifies into rock. Volcanoes have been an important part of human society for centuries, though their\nunderstanding has greatly increased as our understanding of plate tectonics has made them less mysterious. This sec-\ntion describes volcano location, type, hazards, and monitoring.\n4.4.1. Distribution and Tectonics\nFigure 4.25: Association of volcanoes with plate boundaries.\nMost volcanoes are interplate volcanoes. Interplate volcanoes are located at active plate boundaries created by vol-\ncanism at mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones, and continental rifts. The prefix \u201cinter-\u201c means between. Some volcanoes\nare intraplate volcanoes. The prefix \u201cintra-\u201c means within, and intraplate volcanoes are located within tectonic plates, far\nremoved from plate boundaries. Many intraplate volcanoes are formed by hotspots. IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 103\nVolcanoes at Mid-ocean Ridges\nFigure 4.26: Map of spreading ridges throughout the world.\nMost volcanism on Earth occurs on the ocean floor along mid-ocean\nridges, a type of divergent plate boundary (see chapter 2). These\ninterplate volcanoes are also the least observed and famous, since\nmost of them are located under 3,000-4,500 m (10,000-15,000 ft) of\nocean and the eruptions are slow, gentle, and oozing. One exception is\nthe interplate volcanoes of Iceland. The diverging and thinning\noceanic plates allow hot mantle rock to rise, releasing pressure and\ncausing decompression melting. Ultramafic mantle rock, consisting\nlargely of peridotite, partially melts and generates magma that is\nbasaltic. Because of this, almost all volcanoes on the ocean floor are\nFigure 4.27: Pillow basalt on sea floor near Hawai\u2019i.\nbasaltic. In fact, most oceanic lithosphere is basaltic near the surface,\nwith phaneritic gabbro and ultramafic peridotite underneath.\nWhen basaltic lava erupts underwater it emerges in small explosions and/or forms pillow-\nshaped structures called pillow basalts. These seafloor eruptions enable entire underwater\necosystems to thrive in the deep ocean around mid-ocean ridges. This ecosystem exists\naround tall vents emitting black, hot mineral-rich water called deep-sea hydrothermal vents,\nalso known as black smokers.\nFigure 4.28: Black smoker\nhydrothermal vent with a\ncolony of giant (6\u2019+) tube\nworms. 104 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nFigure 4.29: Distribution of hydrothermal vent fields.\nWithout sunlight to support photosynthesis, these organisms instead utilize a process called chemosynthesis. Certain bac-\nteria are able to turn hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gas that smells like rotten eggs, into life-supporting nutrients and water.\nLarger organisms may eat these bacteria or absorb nutrients and water produced by bacteria living symbiotically inside\ntheir bodies.

The process of subduction expels water from\nhydrated minerals in the descending slab, which causes flux melt-\ning in the overlying mantle rock. Because subduction volcanism\noccurs in a volcanic arc, the thickened crust promotes partial melt-\ning and magma differentiation. These evolve the mafic magma from\nthe mantle into more silica-rich magma. The Ring of Fire surrounding\nthe Pacific Ocean, for example, is dominated by subduction-gener-\nated eruptions of mostly silica-rich lava; the volcanoes and plutons\nconsist largely of intermediate-to-felsic rock such as andesite, rhy-\nFigure 4.30: Distribution of volcanoes on the planet. Click\nolite, pumice, and tuff.\nhere for an interactive map of volcano distributions.\nVolcanoes at Continental Rifts\nSome volcanoes are created at continental rifts, where crustal thin-\nning is caused by diverging lithospheric plates, such as the East\nAfrican Rift Basin in Africa. Volcanism caused by crustal thinning\nwithout continental rifting is found in the Basin and Range Province\nin North America. In this location, volcanic activity is produced by ris-\ning magma that stretches the overlying crust. Lower crust or upper\nmantle material rises through the thinned crust, releases pressure,\nand undergoes decompression-induced partial melting. This\nmagma is less dense than the surrounding rock and continues to rise\nthrough the crust to the surface, erupting as basaltic lava. These\neruptions usually result in flood basalts, cinder cones, and basaltic\nlava flows (see video). Relatively young cinder cones of basaltic lava Figure 4.31: Basaltic cinder cones of the Black Rock Desert\nnear Beaver, Utah.\ncan be found in south-central Utah, in the Black Rock Desert Volcanic\nField, which is part of the zone of Basin and Range crustal extension.\nThese Utah cinder cones and lava flows started erupting around 6 million years ago, with the last eruption occurring 720\nyears ago. 106 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Hotspots occur when lithos-\npheric plates glide over a hot mantle plume, an ascending column of solid heated rock\noriginating from deep within the mantle. The mantle plume generates melts as material\nrises, with the magma rising even more. When the ascending magma reaches the lithos-\npheric crust, it spreads out into a mushroom-shaped head that is tens to hundreds of\nkilometers across.\nSince most mantle\nplumes are located\nbeneath the oceanic\nlithosphere, the early\nstages of intraplate vol-\ncanism typically take\nplace underwater. Over\ntime, basaltic volcanoes\nmay build up from the\nFigure 4.32: Diagram showing a sea floor into islands,\nnon-moving source of magma\nsuch as the Hawaiian\n(mantle plume) and a moving\noverriding plate.

IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 107\nA zone of actively erupting volcanism connected to a chain of extinct vol-\ncanoes indicates intraplate volcanism located over a hotspot. These vol-\ncanic chains are created by the overriding oceanic plate slowly moving\nover a hotspot mantle plume. These chains are seen on the seafloor and\ncontinents and include volcanoes that have been inactive for millions of\nyears. The Hawaiian Islands on the Pacific Oceanic plate are the active end\nof a long volcanic chain that extends from the northwest Pacific Ocean to\nthe Emperor Seamounts, all the way to the to the subduction zone beneath\nthe Kamchatka Peninsula.

A parasitic cone is\na small volcano located on the flank of a larger volcano such as\nShastina on Mount Shasta. Kilauea sitting on the flank of Mauna Loa is\nnot considered a parasitic cone because it has its own separate\nmagma chamber, 13) the vents of the parasite and the main volcano,\n14) the rim of the crater, 15) clouds of ash blown into the sky by the\neruption; this settles back onto the volcano and surrounding land.\nFigure 4.35: Mt. Shasta in Washington state with Shastina,\nits parasitic cone.\nThe largest craters are called calderas, such as the Crater\nLake Caldera in Oregon. Many volcanic features are pro-\nduced by viscosity, a basic property of a lava. Viscosity is\nthe resistance to flowing by a fluid. Low viscosity magma\nflows easily more like syrup, the basaltic volcanism that\noccurs in Hawai\u2019i on shield volcanoes. High viscosity\nmeans a thick and sticky magma, typically felsic or inter-\nmediate, that flows slowly, similar to toothpaste.\nFigure 4.36: Oregon\u2019s Crater Lake was formed about 7700 years ago\nafter the eruption of Mount Mazama.\nShield Volcano\nThe largest volcanoes are shield volcanoes. They are characterized by\nbroad low-angle flanks, small vents at the top, and mafic magma cham-\nbers. The name comes from the side view, which resembles a medieval\nwarrior\u2019s shield. They are typically associated with hotspots, mid-ocean\nridges, or continental rifts with rising upper mantle material. The low-\nangle flanks are built up slowly from numerous low-viscosity basaltic lava\nflows that spread out over long distances. The basaltic lava erupts effu-\nsively, meaning the eruptions are small, localized, and predictable.\nFigure 4.37: Kilauea in Hawai\u2019i. IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 109\nTypically, shield volcano eruptions are not much of a hazard to human\nlife\u2014although non-explosive eruptions of Kilauea (Hawai\u2019i) in 2018 produced\nuncharacteristically large lavas that damaged roads and structures. Mauna\nLoa (see USGS page) and Kilauea (see USGS page) in Hawai\u2019i are examples of\nshield volcanoes. Shield volcanoes are also found in Iceland, the Galapagos\nIslands, Northern California, Oregon, and the East African Rift.\nThe largest volcanic edifice in the\nSolar System is Olympus Mons on\nMars.

Lava emerging from fissures is typically mafic and very fluid. The\n2018 Kiluaea eruption included fissures associated with the lava flows.\nSome fissures are caused by the volcanic seismic activity rather than\nlava flows. Some fissures are influenced by plate tectonics, such as\nthe common fissures located parallel to the divergent boundary in Ice-\nland.\nCooling lava can con-\ntract into columns\nwith semi-hexagonal\nFigure 4.43: Devils Tower in Wyoming has columnar cross sections called\njointing.\ncolumnar jointing.\nThis feature forms the\nfamous Devils Tower in Wyoming, possibly an ancient volcanic vent from\nwhich the surrounding layers of lava and ash have been removed by ero-\nsion. Another well-known exposed example of columnar jointing is the\nGiant\u2019s Causeway in Ireland.\nFigure 4.44: Columnar jointing on Giant\u2019s Causeway in\nIreland.\nStratovolcano\nA stratovolcano, also called a composite cone volcano, has steep flanks, a sym-\nmetrical cone shape, distinct crater, and rises prominently above the surrounding\nlandscape. The term composite refers to the alternating layers of pyroclastic frag-\nments like ash and bombs, and solidified lava flows of varying composition. Exam-\nples include Mount Rainier in Washington state and Mount Fuji in Japan.\nStratovolcanoes usually have felsic\nto intermediate magma chambers,\nbut can even produce mafic lavas.\nFigure 4.45: Mount Rainier towers over\nStratovolcanoes have viscous lava\nTacoma, Washington.\nflows and domes, punctuated by\nexplosive eruptions. This produces volcanoes with steep flanks.\nLava Domes\nLava domes are accumula- Figure 4.46: Mt. Fuji in Japan, a typical stratovolcano,\nsymmetrical, increasing slope, visible crater at the\ntions of silica-rich volcanic\ntop.\nrock, such as rhyolite and\nobsidian. Too viscous to flow easily, the felsic lava tends to pile up near\nthe vent in blocky masses. Lava domes often form in a vent within the col-\nlapsed crater of a stratovolcano, and grow by internal expansion. As the\ndome expands, the outer surface cools, hardens, and shatters, and spills\nloose fragments down the sides. Mount Saint Helens has a good example\nof a lava dome inside of a collapsed stratovolcano crater. Examples of\nstand-alone lava domes are Chaiten in Chile and Mammoth Mountain in\nFigure 4.47: Lava domes have started the rebuilding California.\nprocess at Mount St. Helens, Washington. IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 111\nCaldera\nCalderas are steep-walled, basin-shaped\ndepressions formed by the collapse of a vol-\ncanic edifice into an empty magma chamber.\nCalderas are generally very large, with diameters\nof up to 25 km (15.5 mi). The term caldera specif-\nically refers to a volcanic vent; however, it is fre-\nquently used to describe a volcano type.\nCaldera volcanoes are typically formed by\neruptions of high-viscosity felsic lava having\nhigh volatiles content.\nCrater Lake, Yellowstone, and the Long Valley\nFigure 4.49: Wizard Island sits in the caldera at Crater\nCaldera are good examples of this type of vol-\nLake.\ncanism. The caldera at Crater Lake National\nPark in Oregon was created about 6,800 years ago when Mount Mazama, a composite volcano,\nerupted in a huge explosive blast. The volcano ejected large amounts of volcanic ash and\nrapidly drained the magma chamber, causing the top to collapse into a large depression that\nlater filled with water. Wizard Island in the middle of the lake is a later resurgent lava dome that\nformed within the caldera basin.\nThe Yellowstone volcanic system\nerupted three times in the recent geologic\npast\u20142.1, 1.3, and 0.64 million years\nago\u2014leaving behind three caldera basins.\nEach eruption created large rhyolite lava\nFigure 4.48: Timeline of flows as well as pyroclastic flows that\nevents at Mount Mazama.\nsolidified into tuff formations. These\nextra-large eruptions rapidly emptied the\nmagma chamber, causing the roof to collapse and form a caldera.\nThe youngest of the three calderas contains most of Yellowstone\nNational Park, as well as two resurgent lava domes. The calderas\nare difficult to see today due to the amount of time since their erup-\ntions and subsequent erosion and glaciation.\nFigure 4.50: Map of calderas and related rocks around\nYellowstone volcanism started about 17-million years ago as a Yellowstone.\nhotspot under the North American lithospheric plate near the Ore-\ngon/Nevada border. As the plate moved to the southwest over the stationary hotspot, it left behind a track of past vol-\ncanic activities. Idaho\u2019s Snake River Plain was created from volcanism that produced a series of calderas and lava flows.\nThe plate eventually arrived at its current location in northwestern Wyoming, where hotspot volcanism formed the Yel-\nlowstone calderas. 112 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nThe Long Valley Caldera near Mammoth, California, is the result\nof a large volcanic eruption that occurred 760,000 years ago.\nThe explosive eruption dumped enormous amounts of ash\nacross the United States, in a manner similar to the Yellowstone\neruptions. The Bishop Tuff deposit near Bishop, California, is\nmade of ash from this eruption. The current caldera basin is 17\nkm by 32 km (10 mi by 20 mi), large enough to contain the town\nof Mammoth Lakes, major ski resort, airport, major highway,\nresurgent dome, and several hot springs.\nCinder Cone\nCinder cones are Figure 4.51: Several prominent ash beds found in North America,\nsmall volcanoes including three Yellowstone eruptions shaded pink (Mesa Falls,\nHuckleberry Ridge, and Lava Creek), the Bisho Tuff ash bed\nwith steep sides,\n(brown dashed line), and the modern May 18th, 1980 ash fall\nand made of (yellow).\npyroclastic frag-\nments that have been ejected from a pronounced central vent. The small\nfragments are called cinders and the largest are volcanic bombs. The\neruptions are usually short-lived events, typically consisting of mafic lavas\nwith a high content of volatiles. Hot lava is ejected into the air, cooling and\nsolidifying into fragments that accumulate on the flank of the volcano. Cin-\nFigure 4.52: Sunset Crater, Arizona is a cinder cone. der cones are found throughout western North America.\nA recent and striking example of a cinder\ncone is the eruption near the village of Par\u00ed-\ncutin, Mexico that started in 1943. The cinder\ncone started explosively shooting cinders\nout of the vent in the middle of a farmer\u2019s\nfield. The volcanism quickly built up the\ncone to a height of over 90 m (300 ft) within a\nweek, and 365 m (1,200 ft) within the first 8\nmonths. After the initial explosive eruption of\ngases and cinders, basaltic lava poured out\nfrom the base of the cone.

During nine years of eruption activity, the ashfall covered about 260 km2 (100 mi2) and destroyed\nthe nearby town of San Juan. IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 113\nFlood Basalts\nFigure 4.55: World map of flood basalts. Note the largest is the Siberian Traps.\nA rare volcanic eruption type, unobserved in modern times, is the flood basalt. Flood basalts are some of the largest and\nlowest viscosity types of eruptions known. They are not known from any eruption in human history, so the exact mech-\nanisms of eruption are still mysterious. Some famous examples include the Columbia River Flood Basalts in Washington,\nOregon, and Idaho, the Deccan Traps, which cover about 1/3 of the country of India, and the Siberian Traps, which may\nhave been involved in the Earth\u2019s largest mass extinction (see chapter 8).\nFigure 4.56: Igneous rock types and related volcano types. Mid-ocean\nridges and shield volcanoes represent more mafic compositions, and\nstrato (composite) volcanoes generally represent a more intermediate or\nfelsic composition and a convergent plate tectonic boundary. Note that\nthere are exceptions to this generalized layout of volcano types and\nigneous rock composition. 114 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\n4.4.3 Volcanic Hazards and Monitoring\nWhile the most obvious volcanic hazard is lava, the dangers posed by volca-\nnoes go far beyond lava flows. For example, on May 18, 1980, Mount Saint\nHelens (Washington, United States) erupted with an explosion and landslide that\nremoved the upper 400 m (1,300 ft) of the mountain. The initial explosion was\nimmediately followed by a lateral blast, which produced a pyroclastic flow that\ncovered nearly 600 km2 (230 mi2) of forest with hot ash and debris. The pyroclas-\ntic flow moved at speeds of 80-130 kph (50-80 mph), flattening trees and eject-\ning clouds of ash into the air. The USGS video provides an account of this\nexplosive eruption that killed 57 people.\nFigure 4.57: General diagram of volcanic\nhazards.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 115\nIn 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius, located near Naples, Italy, violently erupted sending a pyroclastic flow over the Roman coun-\ntryside, including the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The buried towns were discovered in an archeological expedition\nin the 18th century. Pompeii famously contains the remains (casts) of people suffocated by ash and covered by 10 feet (3\nm) of ash, pumice lapilli, and collapsed roofs.\nFigure 4.59: Mount St. Helens, the day before the May 18th, 1980 eruption (left) and 4\nmonths after the major eruption (right).\nFigure 4.60: Image from the May 18,\n1980, eruption of Mt. Saint Helens,\nWashington.\nPyroclastic Flows\nThe most dangerous volcanic hazard are pyroclastic flows (video). These\nflows are a mix of lava blocks, pumice, ash, and hot gases between\n200\u00b0C-700\u00b0C (400\u00b0F-1,300\u00b0F). The turbulent cloud of ash and gas races down\nthe steep flanks at high speeds up to 193 kph (120 mph) into the valleys around\ncomposite volcanoes. Most explosive, silica-rich, high viscosity magma vol-\ncanoes such as composite cones usually have pyroclastic flows. The rock tuff\nand welded tuff is often formed from these pyroclastic flows.\nFigure 4.61: The material coming down from the\neruption column is a pyroclastic flow. 116 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nThere are numerous examples of deadly pyroclastic flows. In 2014, the Mount\nOntake pyroclastic flow in Japan killed 47 people. The flow was caused by magma\nheating groundwater into steam, which then rapidly ejected with ash and volcanic\nbombs. Some were killed by inhalation of toxic gases and hot ash, while others were\nstruck by volcanic bombs. Two short videos below document eye-witness video of\npyroclastic flows. In the early 1990s, Mount Unzen erupted several times with pyro-\nclastic flows. The pyroclastic flow shown in this famous short video killed 41 peo-\nple. In 1902, on the Caribbean Island Martinique, Mount Pelee erupted with a violent\npyroclastic flow that destroyed the entire town of St. Pierre and killing 28,000 peo-\nple in moments.\nFigure 4.62: The remains of St. Pierre.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

These landslides can be\ntriggered by magma movement, explosive eruptions, large\nearthquakes, and/or heavy rainfall. During the 1980 Mount St.\nHelens eruption, the entire north flank of the volcano col-\nlapsed and released a huge landslide that moved at speeds\nof 160-290 kph (100-180 mph).\nIf enough landslide material reaches the ocean, it may cause\na tsunami. In 1792, a landslide caused by the Mount Unzen\neruption reached the Ariaka Sea, generating a tsunami that\nkilled 15,000 people (see USGS page). When Mount Krakatau\nin Indonesia erupted in 1883, it generated ocean waves that\ntowered 40 m (131 ft) above sea level. The tsunami killed Figure 4.63: Sequence of events for Mount St. Helens, May 18th,\n1980. Note that an earthquake caused a landslide, which caused the\n36,000 people and destroyed 165 villages.\n\u201cuncorking\u201d of the mountain and started the eruption. IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES | 117\nTephra\nVolcanoes, especially composite volcanoes, eject large amounts\nof tephra (ejected rock materials), most notably ash (tephra frag-\nments less than 0.08 inches [2 mm]). Larger tephra is heavier and\nfalls closer to the vent. Larger blocks and bombs pose hazards to\nthose close to the eruption such as at the 2014 Mount Ontake dis-\naster in Japan discussed earlier.\nHot ash poses an immediate\ndanger to people, animals,\nplants, machines, roads, and\nbuildings located close to the\neruption. Ash is fine grained (<\nFigure 4.64: Aman sweeps ash from an eruption of Kelud, 2mm) and can travel airborne\nIndonesia. long distances away from the\neruption site. Heavy accumu-\nFigure 4.65: Micrograph of silica particle\nlations of ash can cause buildings to collapse. In people, it may cause respiratory\nin volcanic ash. A cloud of these is\nissues like silicosis. Ash is destructive to aircraft and automobile engines, which can capable of destroying an aircraft or\ndisrupt transportation and shipping services. In 2010, the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Ice- automobile engine.\nland emitted a large ash cloud into the upper atmosphere, causing the largest air-\ntravel disruption in northern Europe since World War II. No one was injured, but the service disruption was estimated to\nhave cost the world economy billions of dollars.\nVolcanic Gases\nAs magma rises to the surface the confining pressure decreases, and allows dissolved gases to escape into the atmos-\nphere. Even volcanoes that are not actively erupting may emit hazardous gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur diox-\nide (SO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen halides (HF, HCl, or HBr).\nCarbon dioxide tends to sink and accumulate in depressions and basins. In volcanic areas known to emit carbon dioxide,\nlow-lying areas may trap hazardous concentrations of this colorless and odorless gas. The Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort\nin California, is located within the Long Valley Caldera, is one such area of carbon dioxide-producing volcanism. In 2006,\nthree ski patrol members died of suffocation caused by carbon dioxide after falling into a snow depression near a fumarole\n(info).\nIn rare cases, volcanism may create a sudden emission of gases without warning. Limnic eruptions (limne is Greek for lake),\noccur in crater lakes associated with active volcanism. The water in these lakes is supercharged with high concentrations\nof dissolved gases. If the water is physically jolted by a landslide or earthquake, it may trigger an immediate and massive\nrelease of gases out of solution. An analogous example would be what happens to vigorously shaken bottle of carbon-\nated soda when the cap is opened. An infamous limnic eruption occurred in 1986 at Lake Nyos, Cameroon. Almost 2,000\npeople were killed by a massive release of carbon dioxide. 118 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nLahars\nLahar is an Indonesian word and is used to describe a volcanic mudflow\nthat forms from rapidly melting snow or glaciers. Lahars are slurries resem-\nbling wet concrete, and consist of water, ash, rock fragments, and other\ndebris. These mudflows flow down the flanks of volcanoes or mountains\ncovered with freshly-erupted ash and on steep slopes can reach speeds of\nup to 80 kph (50 mph).\nSeveral major cities,\nincluding Tacoma, are\nlocated on prehistoric\nFigure 4.66: Mud line shows the extent of lahars lahar flows that extend\naround Mount St. Helens. for many kilometers\nacross the flood plains\nsurrounding Mount Rainier in Washington (see map). A map of Mount\nBaker in Oregon shows a similar potential hazard for lahar flows (see\nmap). A tragic scenario played out recently, in 1985, when a lahar from\nthe Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia buried the town of Armero\nand killed an estimated 23,000 people.\nMonitoring\nGeologists use various instruments to detect changes or indications\nthat an eruption is imminent. The three videos show different types of\nvolcanic monitoring used to predict eruptions 1) earthquake activity; 2)\nincreases in gas emission; and 3) changes in land surface orientation\nand elevation.\nFigure 4.67: Old lahars around Tacoma, Washington.\nOne video shows how monitoring earthquake frequency, especially\nspecial vibrational earthquakes called harmonic tremors, can detect\nmagma movement and possible eruption. Another video shows how gas monitoring may be used to predict an eruption.\nA rapid increase of gas emission may indicate magma that is actively rising to surface and releasing dissolved gases out\nof solution, and that an eruption is imminent. The last video shows how a GPS unit and tiltmeter can detect land surface\nchanges, indicating the magma is moving underneath it.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Magma is generated from mantle material at several plate tec-\ntonics situations by three types of melting: decompression melting, flux melting, or heat-induced melting. Magma com-\nposition is determined by differences in the melting temperatures of the mineral components (Bowen\u2019s Reaction Series).\nThe processes affecting magma composition include partial melting, magmatic differentiation, assimilation, and col- 120 | IGNEOUS PROCESSES AND VOLCANOES\nlision. Volcanoes come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and are classified by a multiple factors, including magma\ncomposition, and plate tectonic activity. Because volcanism presents serious hazards to human civilization, geologists\ncarefully monitor volcanic activity to mitigate or avoid the dangers it presents.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This is because the majority of the Earth\u2019s surface is made up of sedimentary rocks\nand their common predecessor, sediments. Even though sedimentary rocks can form in drastically different ways, their\norigin and creation have one thing in common, water.\n5.1 The Unique Properties of Water\nWater plays a role in the formation of most sedimentary rock. It is one of the main\nagents involved in creating the minerals in chemical sedimentary rock. It also is a\nweathering and erosion agent, producing the grains that become detrital sedimen-\ntary rock. Several special properties make water an especially unique substance, and\nintegral to the production of sediments and sedimentary rock.\nFigure 5.1: A model of a water\nmolecule, showing the bonds The water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen\nbetween the hydrogen and oxygen. atom arranged in a specific and important geometry. The two hydrogen atoms are sep-\narated by an angle of about 105 degrees, and both are located to one side of the oxygen\natom. This atomic arrangement, with the positively charged hydrogens on one side and negatively charged oxygen on the\nother side, gives the water molecule a property called polarity. Resembling a battery or a magnet, the molecule\u2019s posi-\ntive-negative architecture leads to a whole suite of unique properties. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 127\nPolarity allows water molecules to stick to other substances. This is called adhe-\nsion. Water is also attracted to itself, a property called cohesion, which leads to\nwater\u2019s most common form in the air, a droplet. Cohesion is responsible for creating\nsurface tension, which various insects use to walk on water by distributing their\nweight across the surface.\nThe fact that water is attracted to itself leads to another\nimportant property, one that is extremely rare in the nat-\nural world\u2014the liquid form is denser than the solid form.\nThe polarity of water creates a special type of weak\nFigure 5.2: Dew on a spider\u2019s web.\nbonding called hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds\nallow the molecules in liquid water to sit close together. Water is densest at 4\u00b0C and is less dense\nabove and below that temperature. As water solidifies into ice, the molecules must move apart\nin order to fit into the crystal lattice, causing water to expand and become less dense as it freezes.\nFigure 5.3: Hydrogen\nbonding between water Because of this, ice floats and water at 4oC sinks, which keeps the oceans liquid and prevents\nmolecules.\nthem from freezing solid from the bottom up. This unique property of water keeps Earth, the\nwater planet, habitable.\nEven more critical for supporting life, water remains liquid over a very large range of\ntemperatures, which is also a result of cohesion. Hydrogen bonding allows liquid\nwater can absorb high amounts of energy before turning into vapor or gas. The wide\nrange across which water remains a liquid, 0\u00b0C-100\u00b0C (32\u00b0F-212\u00b0F), is rarely exhibited in\nother substances. Without this high boiling point, liquid water as we know it would be\nconstricted to narrow temperature zones on Earth, instead water is found from pole\nto pole. Further, water is the only substance that exists in all three phases, solid, liquid,\nand gas in Earth\u2019s surface environments.\nWater is a universal solvent, meaning it dissolves more substances than any other\ncommonly found, naturally occurring liquid. The water molecules use polarity and\nhydrogen bonds to pry ions away from the crystal lattice. Water is such a powerful Figure 5.4: A sodium (Na) ion in solution.\nsolvent, it can dissolve even the strongest rocks and minerals given enough time.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 5.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Weathering is a process that turns bedrock into\nsmaller particles, called sediment. Mechanical weathering includes pressure expansion, frost wedging, root wedging,\nand salt expansion. Chemical weathering includes carbonic acid and hydrolysis, dissolution, and oxidation.\nErosion is a mechanical process, usually driven by water, wind, gravity, or ice, which transports sediment (and soil) from\nthe place of weathering. Liquid water is the main agent of erosion. Gravity and mass wasting processes (see chapter 10)\nmove rocks and sediment to new locations. Gravity and ice, in the form of glaciers (see chapter 14), move large rock frag-\nments as well as fine sediment.\nErosion resistance is important in the creation of distinctive geological features. This is well-demonstrated in the cliffs of\nthe Grand Canyon. The cliffs are made of rock left standing after less resistant materials have weathered and eroded away.\nRocks with different levels of erosion resistance also create the unique-looking features called hoodoos in Bryce Canyon\nNational Park and Goblin Valley State Park in Utah.\n5.2.1 Mechanical Weathering\nMechanical weathering physically breaks bedrock into smaller pieces. The usual agents of mechanical weathering are\npressure, temperature, freezing/thawing cycle of water, plant or animal activity, and salt evaporation.\nPressure Expansion\nBedrock buried deep within the Earth is under high pressure and tempera-\nture. When uplift and erosion brings bedrock to the surface, its temperature\ndrops slowly, while its pressure drops immediately. The sudden pressure drop\ncauses the rock to rapidly expand and crack; this is called pressure expansion.\nSheeting or exfoliation is when the rock surface spalls off in layers. Spher-\noidal weathering is a type of exfoliation that produces rounded features and\nis caused when chemical weathering moves along joints in the bedrock.\nFigure 5.5: The outer layer of this granite is\nfractured and eroding away, known as\nexfoliation.\nFrost Wedging\nFrost wedging, also called ice wedging, uses the power of\nexpanding ice to break apart rocks. Water works its way\ninto various cracks, voids, and crevices. As the water\nfreezes, it expands with great force, exploiting any weak-\nnesses. When ice melts, the liquid water moves further into\nthe widened spaces. Repeated cycles of freezing and\nmelting eventually pry the rocks apart. The cycles can\nFigure 5.6: The process of frost wedging.\noccur daily when fluctuations of temperature between\nday and night go from freezing to melting. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 129\nRoot Wedging\nLike frost wedging, root wedging happens when plant roots work them-\nselves into cracks, prying the bedrock apart as they grow. Occasionally\nthese roots may become fossilized. Rhizolith is the term for these roots\npreserved in the rock record. Tunneling organisms such as earthworms,\ntermites, and ants are biological agents that induce weathering similar to\nroot wedging.\nSalt Expansion\nSalt expansion, which\nworks similarly to\nfrost wedging,\noccurs in areas of Figure 5.7: The roots of this tree are demonstrating the\ndestructive power of root wedging. Though this picture\nhigh evaporation or\nis a man-made rock (asphalt), it works on typical rock\nnear-marine environ- as well.\nments. Evaporation\ncauses salts to precipitate out of solution and grow and expand into\ncracks in rock. Salt expansion is one of the causes of tafoni, a series of\nholes in a rock. Tafonis, cracks, and holes are weak points that become\nsusceptible to increased weathering. Another phenomena that occurs\nwhen salt water evaporates can leave behind a square imprint pre-\nFigure 5.8: Tafoni from Salt Point, California. served in a soft sediment, called a hopper crystal.\n5.2.2 Chemical Weathering\nFigure 5.9: Each of these three groups of cubes has an equal volume. However, their surface areas are vastly different. On\nthe left, the single cube has a length, width, and height of 4 units, giving it a surface area of 6(4\u00d74)=96 and a volume of\n4^3=64. The middle eight cubes have a length, width, and height of 2, meaning a surface area of 8(6(2\u00d72))=8\u00d724=192.\nThey also have a volume of 8(2^3)=8\u00d78=64. The 64 cubes on the right have a length, width, and height of 1, leading to a\nsurface area of 64(6(1\u00d71))=64\u00d76=384. The volume remains unchanged, because 64(1^3)=64\u00d71=64. The surface area to\nvolume ratio (SA:V), which is related to the amount of material available for reactions, changes for each as well. On the\nleft, it is 96/64=0.75 or 3:2. The center has a SA/V of 192/64=1.5, or 3:1. On the right, the SA:V is 384/64=6, or 6:1. 130 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nChemical weathering is the dominate weathering process in warm, humid environments. It happens when water, oxygen,\nand other reactants chemically degrade the mineral components of bedrock and turn them into water-soluble ions which\ncan then be transported by water. Higher temperatures accelerate chemical weathering rates.\nChemical and mechanical weathering work hand-in-hand via a fundamental concept called surface-area-to-volume\nratio. Chemical weathering only occurs on rock surfaces because water and reactants cannot penetrate solid rock.\nMechanical weathering penetrates bedrock, breaking large rocks into smaller pieces and creating new rock surfaces. This\nexposes more surface area to chemical weathering, enhancing its effects. In other words, higher surface-area-to-volume\nratios produce higher rates of overall weathering.\nCarbonic Acid and Hydrolysis\nCarbonic acid (H2CO3) forms when carbon dioxide, the\nfifth-most abundant gas in the atmosphere, dissolves in\nwater. This happens naturally in clouds, which is why pre-\ncipitation is normally slightly acidic. Carbonic acid is an\nimportant agent in two chemical weathering reactions, Figure 5.10: Generic hydrolysis diagram, where the bonds in mineral in\nquestion would represent the left side of the diagram.\nhydrolysis and dissolution.\nHydrolysis occurs via two types of reactions. In one reaction, water molecules ionize into positively charged H+1 and OH\u22121\nions and replace mineral cations in the crystal lattice. In another type of hydrolysis, carbonic acid molecules react directly\nwith minerals, especially those containing silicon and aluminum (i.e. Feldspars), to form molecules of clay minerals.\nHydrolysis is the main process that breaks down silicate rock and creates clay minerals. The following is a hydrolysis\nreaction that occurs when silica-rich feldspar encounters carbonic acid to produce water-soluble clay and other ions:\nfeldspar + carbonic acid (in water) \u2192 clay + metal cations (Fe++, Mg++, Ca++, Na+, etc.) + bicarbonate anions (HCO3-1) + silica (SiO2)\nClay minerals are platy silicates or phyllosilicates (see chapter 3) similar to micas, and are the main components of very\nfine-grained sediment. The dissolved substances may later precipitate into chemical sedimentary rocks like evaporite\nand limestone, as well as amorphous silica or chert nodules.\nDissolution\nDissolution is a hydrolysis reaction that dissolves minerals in bedrock\nand leaves the ions in solution, usually in water. Some evaporites and car-\nbonates, like salt and calcite, are more prone to this reaction; however, all\nminerals can be dissolved. Non-acidic water, having a neutral pH of 7, will\ndissolve any mineral, although it may happen very slowly. Water with\nhigher levels of acid, naturally or man-made, dissolves rocks at a higher\nrate. Liquid water is normally slightly acidic due to the presence of car-\nbonic acid and free H+ ions. Natural rainwater can be highly acidic, with pH\nlevels as low as 2. Dissolution can be enhanced by a biological agent,\nsuch as when organisms like lichen and bacteria release organic acids\nonto the rocks they are attached to. Regions with high humidity (airborne\nmoisture) and precipitation experience more dissolution due to greater\nFigure 5.11: In this rock, a pyrite cube has dissolved (as contact time between rocks and water.\nseen with the negative \u201ccorner\u201d impression in the\nrock), leaving behind small specks of gold. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 131\nThe Goldich Dissolution Series shows chemical weathering rates are\nassociated to crystallization rankings in the Bowen\u2019s Reaction Series (see\nchapter 4). Minerals at the top of the Bowen series crystallize under high\ntemperatures and pressures, and chemically weather at a faster rate than\nminerals ranked at the bottom. Quartz, a felsic mineral that crystallizes at\n700\u00b0C, is very resistant to chemical weathering. High crystallization-point\nmafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene (1,250\u00b0C), weather relatively\nrapidly and more completely. Olivine and pyroxene are rarely found as end\nproducts of weathering because they tend to break down into elemental\nions.\nFigure 5.12: This mantle xenolith containing olivine\n(green) is chemically weathering by hydrolysis and\noxidation into the pseudo-mineral iddingsite, which\nis a complex of water, clay, and iron oxides. The\nmore altered side of the rock has been exposed to\nthe environment longer.\nFigure 5.13: Eroded karst topography in Minevre, France.\nDissolution is also noteworthy for the special geological features it\ncreates. In places with abundant carbonate bedrock, dissolution\nweathering can produce a karst topography characterized by sink-\nholes or caves (see chapter 10).\nTimpanogos Cave National Monument in Northern Utah is a well-\nknown dissolution feature. The figure shows a cave formation cre-\nated from dissolution followed by precipitation\u2014groundwater\nsaturated with calcite seeped into the cavern, where evaporation\ncaused the dissolved minerals to precipitate out.\nFigure 5.14: A formation called The Great Heart of\nTimpanogos in Timpanogos Cave National Monument. 132 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nOxidation\nOxidation, the chemical reaction that causes rust in metallic iron,\noccurs geologically when iron atoms in a mineral bond with oxygen.\nAny minerals containing iron can be oxidized. The resultant iron\noxides may permeate a rock if it is rich in iron minerals. Oxides may\nalso form a coating that covers rocks and grains of sediment, or lines\nrock cavities and fractures. If the oxides are more susceptible to\nweathering than the original bedrock, they may create void spaces\ninside the rock mass or hollows on exposed surfaces.\nThree commonly found minerals are produced by iron-oxidation\nreactions: red or grey hematite, brown goethite (pronounced \u201cGUR-\ntite\u201d), and yellow limonite. These iron oxides coat and bind mineral\ngrains together into sedimentary rocks in a process called cementa-\nFigure 5.15: Pyrite cubes are oxidized, becoming a new\ntion, and often give these rocks a dominant color.

When the minerals replacing existing minerals in bedrock are resistant to weathering, iron concretions may\noccur in the rock. When bedrock is replaced by weaker oxides, this process commonly results in void spaces and weak-\nness throughout the rock mass and often leaves hollows on exposed rock surfaces.\n5.2.3 Erosion\nErosion is a mechanical process, usually driven by water, gravity, (see chapter\n10), wind, or ice (see chapter 14) that removes sediment from the place of\nweathering. Liquid water is the main agent of erosion.\nErosion resistance is\nimportant in the creation of\ndistinctive geological fea-\ntures. This is well demon-\nstrated in the cliffs of the\nGrand Canyon. The cliffs\nare made of rock left\nFigure 5.16: A hoodoo near Moab, Utah.\nstanding after less resistant\nmaterials have weathered\nand eroded away. Rocks with different levels erosion resistant also cre-\nate the unique-looking features called hoodoos in Bryce Canyon\nNational Park and Goblin Valley State Park in Utah.\nFigure 5.17: Grand Canyon from Mather Point. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 133\n5.2.4 Soil\nSoil is a combination of air, water, minerals, and organic matter that forms at\nthe transition between biosphere and geosphere. Soil is made when weath-\nering breaks down bedrock and turns it into sediment. If erosion does not\nremove the sediment significantly, organisms can access the mineral content\nof the sediments. These organisms turn minerals, water, and atmospheric\ngases into organic substances that contribute to the soil.\nSoil is an important reservoir for organic components necessary for plants, ani-\nmals, and microorganisms to live. The organic component of soil, called\nhumus, is a rich source of bioavailable nitrogen. Nitrogen is the most common\nelement in the atmosphere, but it exists in a form most life forms are unable to\nuse. Special bacteria found only in soil provide most nitrogen compounds that\nare usable, bioavailable, by life forms.\nFigure 5.18: Sketch and picture of soil.\nThese nitrogen-fixing bacteria absorb nitrogen from the\natmosphere and convert it into nitrogen compounds.\nThese compounds are absorbed by plants and used to\nmake DNA, amino acids, and enzymes. Animals obtain\nbioavailable nitrogen by eating plants, and this is the\nsource of most of the nitrogen used by life. That nitrogen is\nan essential component of proteins and DNA. Soils range\nfrom poor to rich, depending on the amount of humus they\ncontain. Soil productivity is determined by water and nutri-\nent content. Freshly created volcanic soils, called andisols,\nand clay-rich soils that hold nutrients and water are exam-\nFigure 5.19: Schematic of the nitrogen cycle.\nples of productive soils.\nThe nature of the soil, meaning its characteristics, is determined primarily\nby five components: 1) the mineralogy of the parent material; 2) topography,\n3) weathering, 4) climate, and 5) the organisms that inhabit the soil. For\nexample, soil tends to erode more rapidly on steep slopes so soil layers in\nthese areas may be thinner than in flood plains, where it tends to accumu-\nlate. The quantity and chemistry of organic matter of soil affects how much\nand what varieties of life it can sustain. Temperature and precipitation, two\nmajor weathering agents, are dependent on climate. Fungi and bacteria\ncontribute organic matter and the ability of soil to sustain life, interacting\nFigure 5.20: Agricultural terracing, as made by the\nwith plant roots to exchange nitrogen and other nutrients.\nInca culture from the Andes, helps reduce erosion\nand promote soil formation, leading to better\nIn well-formed soils, there is a discernable arrangement of distinct layers farming practices.\ncalled soil horizons. These soil horizons can be seen in road cuts that\nexpose the layers at the edge of the cut. Soil horizons make up the soil profile. Each soil horizon reflects climate, topog-\nraphy, and other soil-development factors, as well as its organic material and mineral sediment composition. The hori-\nzons are assigned names and letters. Differences in naming schemes depend on the area, soil type or research topic. The\nfigure shows a simplified soil profile that uses commonly designated names and letters. 134 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nO Horizon: The top horizon is a thin layer of predomi-\nnantly organic material, such as leaves, twigs, and\nother plant parts that are actively decaying into\nhumus.\nA Horizon: The next layer, called topsoil, consists of\nhumus mixed with mineral sediment. As precipita-\ntion soaks down through this layer, it leaches out sol-\nuble chemicals. In wet climates with heavy\nprecipitation this leaching out produces a separate\nlayer called horizon E, the leaching or eluviation zone.\nB Horizon: Also called subsoil, this layer consists of\nsediment mixed with humus removed from the\nupper layers. The subsoil is where mineral sediment\nis chemically weathered. The amount of organic\nmaterial and degree of weathering decrease with\ndepth. The upper subsoil zone, called regolith, is a\nporous mixture of humus and highly weathered sed-\niment. In the lower zone, saprolite, scant organic\nmaterial is mixed with largely unaltered parent rock.\nC Horizon: This is substratum and is a zone of\nmechanical weathering. Here, bedrock fragments Figure 5.21: A simplified soil profile, showing labeled layers.\nare physically broken but not chemically altered. This\nlayer contains no organic material.\nR Horizon: The final layer consists of unweathered, parent bedrock and fragments.\nThe United States governing body for agriculture, the\nUSDA, uses a taxonomic classification to identify soil types,\ncalled soil orders. Xoxisols or laterite soils are nutrient-poor\nsoils found in tropical regions. While poorly suited for\ngrowing crops, xosisols are home to most of the world\u2019s\nmineable aluminum ore (bauxite). Ardisol forms in dry cli-\nmates and can develop layers of hardened calcite, called\ncaliche. Andisols originate from volcanic ash deposits.\nAlfisols contain silicate clay minerals. These two soil\norders are productive for farming due to their high content\nof mineral nutrients. In general, color can be an important\nfactor in understanding soil conditions. Black soils tend to\nFigure 5.22: A sample of bauxite. Note the unweathered igneous rock in be anoxic, red oxygen-rich, and green oxygen-poor (i.e.\nthe center. reduced).

Careless or uninformed\nhuman activity can seriously damage soil\u2019s life-supporting\nproperties. A prime example is the famous Dust Bowl dis-\naster of the 1930s, which affected the midwestern United\nStates. The damage occurred because of large-scale\nattempts develop prairieland in southern Kansas, Colorado,\nwestern Texas, and Oklahoma into farmland. Poor under-\nstanding of the region\u2019s geology, ecology, and climate led\nto farming practices that ruined the soil profile.\nThe prairie soils and native plants are well adapted to a\nrelatively dry climate. With government encouragement,\nsettlers moved in to homestead the region. They plowed Figure 5.23: A dust storm approaches Stratford, Texas in 1935.\nvast areas of prairie into long, straight rows and planted\ngrain. The plowing broke up the stable soil profile and destroyed the natural grasses and plants, which had long roots that\nanchored the soil layers. The grains they planted had shallower root systems and were plowed up every year, which made\nthe soil prone to erosion. The plowed furrows were aligned in straight rows running downhill, which favored erosion and\nloss of topsoil.\nThe local climate does not produce sufficient precipitation to support non-native grain crops, so the farmers drilled wells\nand over-pumped water from the underground aquifers. The grain crops failed due to lack of water, leaving bare soil that\nwas stripped from the ground by the prairie winds. Particles of midwestern prairie soil were deposited along the east coast\nand as far away as Europe. Huge dust storms called black blizzards made life unbearable, and the once-hopeful home-\nsteaders left in droves. The setting for John Steinbeck\u2019s famous novel and John Ford\u2019s film, The Grapes of Wrath, is Okla-\nhoma during this time.

Clastic or detrital sedimentary rocks are\nmade from pieces of bedrock, sediment, derived primarily by mechanical weathering. Clastic rocks may also include\nchemically weathered sediment. Clastic rocks are classified by grain shape, grain size, and sorting. Chemical sedimentary\nrocks are precipitated from water saturated with dissolved minerals. Chemical rocks are classified mainly by composi-\ntion of minerals in the rock. 136 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\n5.3.1 Lithification and Diagenesis\nLithification turns loose sediment grains, created by weathering and\ntransported by erosion, into clastic sedimentary rock via three inter-\nconnected steps. Deposition happens when friction and gravity over-\ncome the forces driving sediment transport, allowing sediment to\naccumulate. Compaction occurs when material continues to accumu-\nlate on top of the sediment layer, squeezing the grains together and\ndriving out water. The mechanical compaction is aided by weak attrac-\ntive forces between the smaller grains of sediment. Groundwater typi-\ncally carries cementing agents into the sediment. These minerals, such\nas calcite, amorphous silica, or oxides, may have a different composi-\ntion than the sediment grains. Cementation is the process of cement-\ning minerals coating the sediment grains and gluing them together into\na fused rock. Figure 5.24: Geologic unconformity seen at Siccar Point\non the east coast of Scotland.\nDiagenesis is an accompanying\nprocess to lithification and is a low-temperature form of rock metamorphism (see\nchapter 6). During diagenesis, sediments are chemically altered by heat and pres-\nsure. A classic example is aragonite (CaCO3), a form of calcium carbonate that makes\nup most organic shells. When lithified aragonite undergoes diagenesis, the aragonite\nreverts to calcite (CaCO3), which has the same chemical formula but a different crys-\ntalline structure. In sedimentary rock containing calcite and magnesium (Mg), diage-\nnesis may transform the two minerals into dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Diagenesis may\nalso reduce the pore space, or open volume, between sedimentary rock grains. The\nprocesses of cementation, compaction, and ultimately lithification occur within the\nrealm of diagenesis, which includes the processes that turn organic material into fos-\nFigure 5.25: Permineralization in\npetrified wood. sils.\n5.3.2 Detrital Sedimentary Rocks (Clastic)\nDetrital or clastic sedimentary rocks consist of preexisting sediment pieces that comes from weathered bedrock. Most\nof this is mechanically weathered sediment, although some clasts may be pieces of chemical rocks. This creates some\noverlap between the two categories, since clastic sedimentary rocks may include chemical sediments. Detrital or clastic\nrocks are classified and named based on their grain size. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 137\nGrain Size\nFigure 5.26: Size categories of sediments, known as the Wentworth scale.\nDetrital rock is classified according to sediment grain size, which is graded from large to small on the Wentworth scale\n(see figure 5.26). Grain size is the average diameter of sediment fragments in sediment or rock. Grain sizes are delin-\neated using a log base 2 scale. For example, the grain sizes in the pebble class are 2.52, 1.26, 0.63, 0.32, 0.16, and 0.08\ninches, which correlate respectively to very coarse, coarse, medium, fine, and very fine granules. Large fragments, or clasts,\ninclude all grain sizes larger than 2 mm (5/64 in). These include, boulders, cobbles, granules, and gravel. Sand has a grain\nsize between 2 mm and 0.0625 mm, about the lower limit of the naked eye\u2019s resolution. Sediment grains smaller than sand\nare called silt. Silt is unique; the grains can be felt with a finger or as grit between your teeth, but are too small to see with\nthe naked eye. 138 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nSorting and Rounding\nSorting describes the range of grain sizes within sediment or sedimentary\nrock. Geologists use the term \u201cwell sorted\u201d to describe a narrow range of\ngrain sizes, and \u201cpoorly sorted\u201d for a wide range of grain sizes (see figure\n5.27). It is important to note that soil engineers use similar terms with oppo-\nsite definitions; well graded sediment consists of a variety of grain sizes,\nand poorly graded sediment has roughly the same grain sizes.\nWhen reading the story told by rocks, geologists use sorting to interpret\nFigure 5.27: A well-sorted sediment (left) and a\nerosion or transport processes, as well as deposition energy. For example,\npoorly-sorted sediment (right).\nwind-blown sands are typically extremely well sorted, while glacial\ndeposits are typically poorly sorted. These characteristics help identify the type of erosion process that occurred. Coarse-\ngrained sediment and poorly sorted rocks are usually found nearer to the source of sediment, while fine sediments are\ncarried farther away. In a rapidly flowing mountain stream you would expect to see boulders and pebbles. In a lake fed by\nthe stream, there should be sand and silt deposits. If you also find large boulders in the lake, this may indicate the involve-\nment of another sediment transport process, such as rockfall caused by ice- or root-wedging.\nRounding is created when angular corners of rock frag-\nments are removed from a piece of sediment due to abra-\nsion during transport. Well-rounded sediment grains are\ndefined as being free of all sharp edges. Very angular sed-\niment retains the sharp corners. Most clast fragments start\nwith some sharp edges due to the bedrock\u2019s crystalline\nstructure, and those points are worn down during transport.\nMore rounded grains imply a longer erosion time or trans-\nport distance, or more energetic erosional process. Mineral Figure 5.28: Degree of rounding in sediments. Sphericity refers to the\nspherical nature of an object, a completely different measurement\nhardness is also a factor in rounding.\nunrelated to rounding.\nComposition and Provenance\nComposition describes the mineral components found in sediment or sedimentary\nrock and may be influenced by local geology, like source rock and hydrology. Other\nthan clay, most sediment components are easily determined by visual inspection (see\nchapter 3). The most commonly found sediment mineral is quartz because of its low\nchemical reactivity and high hardness, making it resistant to weathering, and its ubiq-\nuitous occurrence in continental bedrock. Other commonly found sediment grains\ninclude feldspar and lithic fragments. Lithic fragments are pieces of fine-grained\nbedrock, and include mud chips, volcanic clasts, or pieces of slate.\nWeathering of volcanic rock produces Hawaii\u2019s famous black (basalt) and green\n(olivine) sand beaches, which are rare elsewhere on Earth. This is because the local\nrock is composed almost entirely of basalt and provides an abundant source of dark\ncolored clasts loaded with mafic minerals. According to the Goldich Dissolution Series,\nclasts high in mafic minerals are more easily destroyed compared to clasts com-\nposed of felsic minerals like quartz.\nFigure 5.29: A sand grain made of\nbasalt, known as a microlitic volcanic\nlithic fragment.

Provenance is determined by analyz-\ning mineral composition and types of fossils present, as well as\ntextural features like sorting and rounding. Provenance is impor-\ntant for describing tectonic history, visualizing paleogeographic\nformations, unraveling an area\u2019s geologic history, or reconstruct-\ning past supercontinents.\nIn quartz sandstone, sometimes called quartz arenite (SiO2),\nprovenance may be determined using a rare, durable clast min-\nFigure 5.30: Hawiian beach composed of green olivine sand eral called zircon (ZrSiO4).

Typically, smaller sediment grains, collectively called ground-\nmass or matrix, fill in much of the volume between the larger clasts, and hold\nthe clasts together. Conglomerates are rocks containing coarse rounded\nclasts, and breccias contain angular clasts (see figure 5.31). Both conglomer-\nates and breccias are usually poorly sorted.\nMedium-grained rocks com-\nposed mainly of sand are called\nsandstone, or sometimes arenite\nif well sorted. Sediment grains in Figure 5.31: Megabreccia in Titus Canyon, Death\nValley National Park, California.\nsandstone can having a wide\nvariety of mineral compositions,\nroundness, and sorting. Some sandstone names indicate the rock\u2019s mineral\ncomposition. Quartz sandstone contains predominantly quartz sediment\ngrains. Arkose is sandstone with significant amounts of feldspar, usually greater\nthan 25%. Sandstone that contains feldspar, which weathers more quickly than\nFigure 5.32: Enlarged image of frosted and\nrounded windblown sand grains. quartz, is useful for analyzing the local geologic history. Greywacke is a term\nwith conflicting definitions. Greywacke may refer to sandstone with a muddy\nmatrix, or sandstone with many lithic fragments (small rock pieces).\nFine-grained rocks include mudstone, shale, siltstone, and clay-\nstone. Mudstone is a general term for rocks made of sediment grains\nsmaller than sand (less than 2 mm). Rocks that are fissile, meaning they\nseparate into thin sheets, are called shale. Rocks exclusively com-\nposed of silt or clay sediment, are called siltstone or claystone,\nrespectively. These last two rock types are rarer than mudstone or\nshale.\nFigure 5.33: The Rochester Shale, New York. Note the thin\nfissility in the layers. 140 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nRock types found as a mixture between the main classifications, may be named\nusing the less-common component as a descriptor. For example, a rock containing\nsome silt but mostly rounded sand and gravel is called silty conglomerate. Sand-\nrich rock containing minor amounts of clay is called clayey sandstone.\n5.3.3 Chemical, Biochemical, and Organic\nChemical sedimentary rocks are formed by processes that do not directly involve\nmechanical weathering and erosion. Chemical weathering may contribute the\ndissolved materials in water that ultimately form these rocks. Biochemical and Figure 5.34: Claystone laminations from\nGlacial Lake Missoula.\norganic sediments are clastic in the sense that they are made from pieces of organic\nmaterial that is deposited, buried, and lithified; however, they are usually classified as being chemically produced.\nInorganic chemical sedimentary rocks are made of minerals precipitated from ions dissolved in solution, and created\nwithout the aid of living organisms. Inorganic chemical sedimentary rocks form in environments where ion concentration,\ndissolved gasses, temperatures, or pressures are changing, which causes minerals to crystallize.\nBiochemical sedimentary rocks are formed from shells and bodies of underwater organisms. The living organisms extract\nchemical components from the water and use them to build shells and other body parts. The components include arago-\nnite, a mineral similar to and commonly replaced by calcite, and silica.\nOrganic sedimentary rocks come from organic material that has been deposited and lithified, usually underwater. The\nsource materials are plant and animal remains that are transformed through burial and heat, and end up as coal, oil, and\nmethane (natural gas).\nInorganic Chemical\nInorganic chemical sedimentary rocks are formed when minerals precip-\nitate out of an aqueous solution, usually due to water evaporation. The\nprecipitate minerals form various salts known as evaporites. For example,\nthe Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah flood with winter rains and dry out every\nsummer, leaving behind salts such as gypsum and halite. The deposition\norder of evaporites deposit is opposite to their solubility order, i.e. as water\nevaporates and increases the mineral concentration in solution, less solu-\nble minerals precipitate out sooner than the highly soluble minerals. The\ndeposition order and saturation percentages are depicted in the table,\nbearing in mind the process in nature may vary from laboratory derived val-\nues.

Tufa can form near degassing water and in saline lakes.\nWaterfalls downstream of springs often precipitate tufa as the turbulent\nwater enhances degassing of carbon dioxide, which makes calcite less\nsoluble and causes it to precipitate. Saline lakes concentrate calcium car-\nbonate from a combination of wave action causing degassing, springs in\nthe lakebed, and evaporation. In salty Mono Lake in California, tufa towers\nwere exposed after water was diverted and lowered the lake levels.\nCave deposits like stalac-\ntites and stalagmites are\nanother form of chemical\nFigure 5.37: Limestone tufa towers along the shores\nof Mono Lake, California. precipitation of calcite,\nin a form called traver-\ntine. Calcite slowly precipitates from water to form the travertine, which\noften shows banding. This process is similar to the mineral growth on\nfaucets in your home sink or shower that comes from hard (mineral rich)\nwater. Travertine also forms at hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Spring\nin Yellowstone National Park.\nFigure 5.38: Travertine terraces of Mammoth Hot\nSprings, Yellowstone National Park, USA.\nBanded iron formation\ndeposits commonly formed early in Earth\u2019s history, but this type of chemical\nsedimentary rock is no longer being created.

The iron oxide was deposited, usually\nin bands alternating with layers of chert.\nChert, another commonly found\nchemical sedimentary rock, is usually\nproduced from silica (SiO2) precipi-\nFigure 5.39: Alternating bands of iron-rich and\nsilica-rich mud, formed as oxygen combined with tated from groundwater.

Water deep underground is subjected to higher pressures\nand temperatures, which helps dissolve silica into an aqueous solution. As the\ngroundwater rises toward or emerges at the surface the silica precipitates out, often\nFigure 5.40: A type of chert, flint, shown\nas a cementing agent or into nodules. For example, the bases of the geysers in Yel- with a lighter weathered crust.\nlowstone National Park are surrounded by silica deposits called geyserite or sinter.\nThe silica is dissolved in water that is thermally heated by a relatively deep magma source.

Chert has many synonyms, some of which may have gem value\nsuch as jasper, flint, onyx, and agate, due to subtle differences in colors, striping, etc., but chert is the more general term\nused by geologists for the entire group.\nOolites are among the few limestone forms created by an inorganic\nchemical process, similar to what happens in evaporite deposition. When\nwater is oversaturated with calcite, the mineral precipitates out around a\nnucleus, a sand grain or shell fragment, and forms little spheres called\nooids (see figure 5.41). As evaporation continues, the ooids continue build-\ning concentric layers of calcite as they roll around in gentle currents.\nBiochemical\nBiochemical sedimentary rocks are not\nthat different from chemical sedimen-\ntary rocks; they are also formed from\nFigure 5.41: Ooids forming an oolite.\nions dissolved in solution. However,\nbiochemical sedimentary rocks rely on biological processes to extract the dissolved\nmaterials out of the water. Most macroscopic marine organisms use dissolved miner-\nals, primarily aragonite (calcium carbonate), to build hard parts such as shells. When\norganisms die the hard parts settle as sediment, which become buried, compacted and\ncemented into rock.\nThis biochemical extraction and secretion is the main process for forming limestone,\nthe most commonly occurring, non-clastic sedimentary rock. Limestone is mostly\nFigure 5.42: Fossiliferous limestone\n(with brachiopods and bryozoans) made of calcite (CaCO3) and sometimes includes dolomite (CaMgCO3), a close relative.\nfrom the Kope Formation of Ohio.

Entire coral reefs and their ecosystems can be preserved in\nexquisite detail in limestone rock (see figure 5.42). Fossiliferous lime-\nstone contains many visible fossils. A type of limestone called coquina\noriginates from beach sands made predominantly of shells that were\nthen lithified. Coquina is composed of loosely-cemented shells and shell\nfragments. You can find beaches like this in modern tropical environ-\nments, such as the Bahamas. Chalk contains high concentrations of\nshells from a microorganism called a coccolithophore.

For example, the shells of radiolarians (zooplankton) and diatoms (phytoplankton) are made of\nsilica, so they produce siliceous ooze.

Geologists use these structures to\ninterpret the processes that made the rock and the environment in which it formed. They use uniformitarianism to usually\ncompare sedimentary structures formed in modern environments to lithified counterparts in ancient rocks. Below is a sum-\nmary discussion of common sedimentary structures that are useful for interpretations in the rock record.\n5.4.1 Bedding Planes\nThe most basic sedimentary structure is bedding planes, the planes that\nseparate the layers or strata in sedimentary and some volcanic rocks.\nVisible in exposed outcroppings, each bedding plane indicates a\nchange in sediment deposition conditions. This change may be subtle.\nFor example, if a section of underlying sediment firms up, this may be\nenough to create a form a layer that is dissimilar from the overlying sed-\niment. Each layer is called a bed, or stratum, the most basic unit of\nstratigraphy, the study of sedimentary layering.\nAs would be expected, bed thick-\nFigure 5.47: Horizontal strata.\nness can indicate sediment deposi-\ntion quantity and timing. Technically, a bed is a bedding plane thicker than 1 cm (0.4 in)\nand the smallest mappable unit. A layer thinner than 1 cm (0.4 in) is called a lamina.\nVarves are bedding planes created when laminae and beds are deposited in repetitive\ncycles, typically daily or seasonally. Varves are valuable geologic records of climatic\nhistories, especially those found in lakes and glacial deposits.\nFigure 5.48: Students from the\nUniversity of Wooster examine beds\nof Ordovician limestone in central\nTennessee. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 145\n5.4.2 Graded Bedding\nGraded bedding refers to a sequence of increasingly coarse- or fine-\ngrained sediment layers. Graded bedding often develops when sedi-\nment deposition occurs in an environment of decreasing energy. A\nBouma sequence is graded bedding observed in clastic rock called tur-\nbidite. Bouma sequence beds are formed by offshore sediment gravity\nflows, which are underwater flows of sediment. These subsea density\nflows begin when sediment is stirred up by an energetic process and\nbecomes a dense slurry of mixed grains. The sediment flow courses\ndownward through submarine channels and canyons due to gravity acting\non the density difference between the denser slurry and less dense sur-\nrounding seawater. As the flow reaches deeper ocean basins it slows\ndown, loses energy, and deposits sediment in a Bouma sequence of\nFigure 5.49: Image of the classic Bouma sequence.\ncoarse grains first, followed by increasingly finer grains (see figure 5.49).\nA=coarse- to fine-grained sandstone, possibly with\nan erosive base. B=laminated medium- to\nfine-grained sandstone. C=rippled fine-grained\nsandstone. D=laminated siltstone grading to\nmudstone.\n5.4.3 Flow Regime and Bedforms\nIn fluid systems, such as moving water or wind, sand is the\nmost easily transported and deposited sediment grain.\nSmaller particles like silt and clay are less movable by fluid\nsystems because the tiny grains are chemically attracted to\neach other and stick to the underlying sediment. Under\nhigher flow rates, the fine silt and clay sediment tends to\nstay in place and the larger sand grains get picked up and\nmoved.\nBedforms are sedimentary structures created by fluid sys-\ntems working on sandy sediment. Grain size, flow velocity,\nand flow regime or pattern interact to produce bedforms\nhaving unique, identifiable physical characteristics. Flow\nregimes are divided into upper and lower regimes, which\nare further divided into uppermost, upper, lower, and low- Figure 5.50: Bedforms from under increasing flow velocities.\nermost parts. The table below shows bedforms and their\nassociated flow regimes. For example, the dunes bedform is created in the upper part of the lower flow regime.\nFlow regime (part) Bedform Description\nLower (lowest) Plane bed Lower plane bed, flat laminations\nLower (lower) Ripples Small (with respect to flow) inclined layers dipping downflow\nLower (upper) Dunes Larger inclined cross beds, \u00b1ripples, dipping downflow\nUpper (lower) Plane bed Flat layers, can include lined-up grains (parting lineations)\nUpper (upper) Antidunes Hard to preserve reverse dunes dipping shallowly upflow\nUpper (uppermost) Chutes/pools (rare) Erosional, not really a bedform; rarely found preserved\nTable 5.2: Bedforms and their associated flow regimes. 146 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nPlane Beds\nPlane beds created in the lower flow regime are like bedding planes, on a\nsmaller scale. The flat, parallel layers form as sandy sediment piles and move\non top of layers below. Even non-flowing fluid systems, such as lakes, can pro-\nduce sediment plane beds. Plane beds in the upper flow regime are created\nby fast-flowing fluids. They may look identical to lower-flow-regime beds;\nhowever, they typically show parting lineations, slight alignments of grains in\nrows and swaths, caused by high sediment transport rates that only occur in\nupper flow regimes.\nFigure 5.51: Subtle lines across this sandstone\n(trending from the lower left to upper right) are\nparting lineations.\nRipples\nRipples are known by several names: ripple marks, ripple cross beds, or\nripple cross laminations. The ridges or undulations in the bed are created\nas sediment grains pile up on top of the plane bed. With the exception of\ndunes, the scale of these beds is typically measured in centimeters. Occa-\nsionally, large flows like glacial lake outbursts, can produce ripples as tall\nas 20 m (66 ft).\nFirst scientifically described by\nFigure 5.52: Modern current ripple in sand from the\nHertha Ayrton, ripple shapes are Netherlands. The flow creates a steep side down\ndetermined by flow type and can current. In this image, the flow is from right to left.\nbe straight-crested, sinuous, or\ncomplex. Asymmetrical ripples form in a unidirectional flow. Symmetrical ripples\nare the result of an oscillating back-and-forth flow typical of intertidal swash\nzones. Climbing ripples are created from high sedimentation rates and appear as\noverlapping layers of ripple shapes (see figure 5.54).\nFigure 5.53: A bidirectional flow creates this\nsymmetrical wave ripple. From rocks in\nNomgon, Mongolia. Note the crests of the\nripples have been eroded away by\nsubsequent flows in places.\nFigure 5.54: Climbing ripple deposit from India. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 147\nDunes\nDunes are very large and prominent versions of ripples, and typical\nexamples of large cross bedding. Cross bedding happens when\nripples or dunes pile atop one another, interrupting, and/or cutting\ninto the underlying layers. Desert sand dunes are probably the first\nimage conjured up by this category of bedform.\nBritish geologist Agnold (1941) considered only Barchan and linear\nSeif dunes as the only true dune forms. Other workers have recog-\nnized transverse and star dunes as well as parabolic and linear\ndunes anchored by plants that are common in coastal areas as\nother types of dunes.\nDunes are the most common\nsedimentary structure found\nFigure 5.55: Lithified cross-bedded dunes from the high\nwithin channelized flows of air or country of Zion National Park, Utah. The complexity of\nbedding planes results from the three-dimensional network\nwater. The biggest difference\nof ancient dune flows.\nbetween river dunes and air-\nformed (desert) dunes is the depth of fluid system. Since the atmosphere\u2019s depth is\nimmense when compared to a river channel, desert dunes are much taller than those\nfound in rivers. Some famous air-formed dune landscapes include the Sahara Desert,\nDeath Valley, and the Gobi Desert.\nAs airflow moves sediment along, the grains accumulate on the dune\u2019s windward sur-\nface (facing the wind). The angle of the windward side is typically shallower than the\nleeward (downwind) side, which has grains falling down over it. This difference in slopes\ncan be seen in a bed cross-section and indicates the direction of the flow in the past.\nThere are typically two styles of dune beds: the more common trough cross beds with\nFigure 5.56: Modern sand dune in curved windward surfaces, and rarer planar cross beds with flat windward surfaces.\nMorocco.\nIn tidal locations with strong in-and-out flows, dunes can develop in opposite directions. This produces a feature called\nherringbone cross bedding.\nFigure 5.57: Herringbone cross-bedding from the\nMazomanie Formation, upper Cambrian of Minnesota. 148 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nAnother dune formation variant occurs when very strong, hurricane-\nstrength, winds agitate parts of the usually undisturbed seafloor. These beds\nare called hummocky cross stratification and have a 3D architecture of hills\nand valleys, with inclined and declined layering that matches the dune\nshapes.\nAntidunes\nAntidunes are so named\nbecause they share similar\ncharacteristics with dunes,\nbut are formed by a different, Figure 5.58: Hummocky-cross stratification, seen as\nopposing process. While wavy lines throughout the middle of this rock face.\nBest example is just above the pencil in the center.\ndunes form in lower flow\nregimes, antidunes come\nfrom fast-flowing upper flow regimes. In certain conditions of high flow\nrates, sediment accumulates upstream of a subtle dip instead of traveling\ndownstream (see figure 5.59). Antidunes form in phase with the flow; in\nrivers they are marked by rapids in the current. Antidunes are rarely pre-\nFigure 5.59: Antidunes forming in Urdaibai, Spain. served in the rock record because the high flow rates needed to produce\nthe beds also accelerate erosion.\n5.4.4 Bioturbation\nBioturbation is the result of organisms burrowing through\nsoft sediment, which disrupts the bedding layers. These\ntunnels are backfilled and eventually preserved when the\nsediment becomes rock. Bioturbation happens most\ncommonly in shallow, marine environments, and can be\nused to indicate water depth.\nFigure 5.60: Bioturbated dolomitic siltstone from Kentucky.\n5.4.5 Mudcracks\nMudcracks occur in clay-rich sediment that is submerged underwater\nand later dries out. Water fills voids in the clay\u2019s crystalline structure,\ncausing the sediment grains to swell. When this waterlogged sediment\nbegins to dry out, the clay grains shrink. The sediment layer forms deep\npolygonal cracks with tapered openings toward the surface, which can\nbe seen in profile. The cracks fill with new sediment and become visible\nveins running through the lithified rock. These dried-out clay beds are a\nmajor source of mud chips, small fragments of mud or shale, which\ncommonly become inclusions in sandstone and conglomerate. What\nmakes this sedimentary structure so important to geologists, is they only\nform in certain depositional environments\u2014such as tidal flats that form\nFigure 5.61: Lithified mudcracks from Maryland.\nunderwater and are later exposed to air. Syneresis cracks are similar in\nappearance to mudcracks but much rarer; they are formed when subaqueous (underwater) clay sediment shrinks. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 149\n5.4.6 Sole Marks\nSole marks are small features typically found in river deposits. They form at the\nbase of a bed, the sole, and on top of the underlying bed. They can indicate several\nthings about the deposition conditions, such as flow direction or stratigraphic up-\ndirection (see Geopetal Structures section). Flute casts or scour marks are grooves\ncarved out by the forces of fluid flow and sediment loads. The upstream part of the\nflow creates steep grooves and downstream the grooves are shallower. The\ngrooves subsequently become filled by overlying sediment, creating a cast of the\noriginal hollow.\nFormed similarly to flute casts but with a\nFigure 5.62: This flute cast shows a flow\nmore regular and aligned shape, groove\ndirection toward the upper right of the\nimage, as seen by the bulge sticking down casts are produced by larger clasts or\nout of the layer above.

While they are generally believed to be created by rainfall, they\nmay be caused by other agents such as escaping gas bubbles.\nFigure 5.65: Mississippian raindrop impressions\nover wave ripples from Nova Scotia. 150 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\n5.4.8 Imbrication\nImbrication is a stack of large and usually flat clasts\u2014cobbles, gravels, mud\nchips, etc.\u2014that are aligned in the direction of fluid flow. The clasts may be\nstacked in rows, with their edges dipping down and flat surfaces aligned to\nface the flow (see figure 5.66). Or their flat surfaces may be parallel to the layer\nand long axes aligned with flow. Imbrications are useful for analyzing paleocur-\nrents, or currents found in the geologic past, especially in alluvial deposits.\nFigure 5.66: Cobbles in this conglomerate are\npositioned in a way that they are stacked on\neach other, which occurred as flow went from\n5.4.9 Geopetal Structures\nleft to right.\nGeopetal structures, also called up-direction indicators, are used to identify which\nway was up when the sedimentary rock layers were originally formed. This is espe-\ncially important in places where the rock layers have been deformed, tilted, or over-\nturned. Well preserved mudcracks, sole marks, and raindrop impressions can be\nused to determine up direction. Other useful geopetal structures include:\n\u2022 Vugs: Small voids in the rock that usually become filled during diagenesis. If\nthe void is partially filled or filled in stages, it serves as a permanent record of a\nlevel bubble, frozen in time.\n\u2022 Cross bedding \u2013 In places where ripples or dunes pile on top of one another, Figure 5.67: This bivalve (clam) fossil was\nwhere one cross bed interrupts and/or cuts another below, this shows a partially filled with tan sediment, partially\nempty.

Intact fos-\nsilized coral reefs are excellent up indicators because of their large size and easily distin-\nguishable top and bottom. Index fossils, such as ammonites, can be used to age date\nstrata and determine up direction based on relative rock ages.\n\u2022 Vesicles \u2013 Lava flows eliminate gas upwards. An increase of vesicles toward the top of the\nflow indicates up.\nFigure 5.68: Eubrontes\ntrace fossil from Utah,\nshowing the geopetal\ndirection is into the image.

Knowing where\nand how a particular sedimentary rock was formed can help geologists paint a picture of past environments\u2014such as a\nmountain glacier, gentle floodplain, dry desert, or deep-sea ocean floor. The study of depositional environments is a\ncomplex endeavor; the table shows a simplified version of what to look for in the rock record. 152 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nCommon rock\nLocation Sediment Typical fossils Sedimentary structures\ntypes\nVery fine muds and oozes,\nAbyssal Chert Diatoms Few\ndiatomaceous Earth\nSubmarine Graded Bouma sequences,\nClastic rocks Rare Channels, fan shape\nfan alternating sand/mud\nContinental Shale, siltstone,\nMud, possible sand, countourites Rare Swaths\nslope limestone\nLower\nLaminated sand Sandstone Bioturbation Hummocky cross beds\nshoreface\nUpper\nPlanar sand Sandstone Bioturbation Plane beds, cross beds\nshoreface\nLittoral\nVery well sorted sand Sandstone Bioturbation Few\n(beach)\nShale, mudstone,\nTidal flat Mud and sand with channels Bioturbation Mudcracks, symmetric ripples\nsiltstone\nReef Lime mud with coral Limestone Many, commonly coral Few\nLagoon Laminated mud Shale Many, bioturbation Laminations\nChannelized sand with mud,\nDelta Clastic rocks Many to few Cross beds\n\u00b1swamp\nSand and mud, can have larger Sandstone, Cross beds, channels,\nFluvial (river) Bone beds (rare)\nsediments conglomerate asymmetric ripples\nAlluvial Mud to boulders, poorly sorted Clastic rocks Rare Channels, mud cracks\nLacustrine Invertebrates, rare (deep)\nFine-grained laminations Shale Laminations\n(lake) bone beds\nPaludal\nPlant material Coal Plant debris Rare\n(swamp)\nAeolian\nVery well sorted sand and silt Sandstone Rare Cross beds (large)\n(dunes)\nConglomerate\nGlacial Mud to boulders, poorly sorted Striations, drop stones\n(tillite)\nTable 5.3: Rock record and depositional environments.\n5.5.1 Marine\nMarine depositional environments are completely and constantly submerged in seawater. Their depositional character-\nistics are largely dependent on the depth of water with two notable exceptions, submarine fans and turbidites. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 153\nAbyssal\nFigure 5.70: Marine sediment thickness. Note the lack of sediment away from the continents.\nAbyssal sedimentary rocks form on the abyssal plain. The plain encompasses relatively flat ocean floor with some minor\ntopographical features, called abyssal hills. These small seafloor mounts range 100 m to 20 km in diameter, and are possi-\nbly created by extension. Most abyssal plains do not experience significant fluid movement, so sedimentary rock formed\nthere are very fine grained.\nThere are three categories of abyssal sediment. Calcareous oozes consist of calcite-rich plankton shells that have fallen\nto the ocean floor. An example of this type of sediment is chalk. Siliceous oozes are also made of plankton debris, but\nthese organisms build their shells using silica or hydrated silica. In some cases such as with diatomaceous earth, sedi-\nment is deposited below the calcite compensation depth, a depth where calcite solubility increases. Any calcite-based\nshells are dissolved, leaving only silica-based shells. Chert is another common rock formed from these types of sediment.\nThese two types of abyssal sediment are also classified as biochemical in origin (see biochemical section).\nThe third sediment type is pelagic clay. Very fine-grained clay particles, typically\nbrown or red, descend through the water column very slowly. Pelagic clay deposi-\ntion occurs in areas of remote open ocean, where there is little plankton accumula-\ntion.\nTwo notable exceptions to the\nfine-grained nature of abyssal\nsediment are submarine fan\nand turbidite deposits. Subma-\nrine fans occur offshore at the\nFigure 5.71: Diatomaceous earth.\nbase of large river systems.\nThey are initiated during times\nof low sea level, as strong river currents carve submarine canyons into\nthe continental shelf. When sea levels rise, sediment accumulates on\nthe shelf typically forming large, fan-shaped floodplains called deltas.\nPeriodically, the sediment is disturbed creating dense slurries that\nFigure 5.72: Turbidites inter-deposited within submarine\nflush down the underwater canyons in large gravity-induced events\nfans.\ncalled turbidites. The submarine fan is formed by a network of tur- 154 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nbidites that deposit their sediment loads as the slope decreases, much like what happens above-water at alluvial fans\nand deltas. This sudden flushing transports coarser sediment to the ocean floor where they are otherwise uncommon.\nTurbidites are also the typical origin of graded Bouma sequences. (see chapter 5).\nContinental Slope\nContinental slope deposits are not common in the rock\nrecord. The most notable type of continental slope\ndeposits are contourites. Contourites form on the slope\nbetween the continental shelf and deep ocean floor.\nDeep-water ocean currents deposit sediment into smooth\ndrifts of various architectures, sometimes interwoven with\nturbidites.\nLower Shoreface\nFigure 5.73: Contourite drift deposit imaged with seismic waves.\nThe lower shoreface lies below the normal depth of wave agita-\ntion, so the sediment is not subject to daily winnowing and depo-\nsition. These sediment layers are typically finely laminated, and\nmay contain hummocky cross-stratification. Lower shoreface\nbeds are affected by larger waves, such those as generated by\nhurricanes and other large storms.\nFigure 5.74: Diagram describing wavebase.\nUpper Shoreface\nFigure 5.75: Diagram of zones of the shoreline.\nThe upper shoreface contains sediments within the zone of normal wave action, but still submerged below the beach\nenvironment. These sediments usually consist of very well sorted, fine sand. The main sedimentary structure is planar\nbedding consistent with the lower part of the upper flow regime, but it can also contain cross bedding created by long-\nshore currents. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 155\n5.5.2 Transitional Coastline Environments\nTransitional environments, more often called shoreline or coastline environ-\nments, are zones of complex interactions caused by ocean water hitting land.\nThe sediment preservation potential is very high in these environments\nbecause deposition often occurs on the continental shelf and underwater.\nShoreline environments are an important source of hydrocarbon deposits\n(petroleum, natural gas).\nThe study of shoreline depositional environments is called sequence\nstratigraphy. Sequence stratigraphy examines depositional changes and\n3D architectures associated with rising and falling sea levels, which is the\nmain force at work in shoreline deposits. These sea-level fluctuations come Figure 5.76: The rising sea levels of transgressions\ncreate onlapping sediments, regressions create\nfrom the daily tides, as well as climate changes and plate tectonics. A\nofflapping.\nsteady rise in sea level relative to the shoreline is called transgression.\nRegression is the opposite, a relative drop in sea level. Some common components of shoreline environments are littoral\nzones, tidal flats, reefs, lagoons, and deltas. For a more in-depth look at these environments, see chapter 12.\nLittorals\nThe littoral zone, better known as the beach, consists of highly weath-\nered, homogeneous, well-sorted sand grains made mostly of quartz.\nThere are black sand and other types of sand beaches, but they tend to\nbe unique exceptions rather than the rule. Because beach sands, past or\npresent, are so highly evolved, the amount grain weathering can be dis-\ncerned using the minerals zircon, tourmaline, and rutile. This tool is called\nthe ZTR (zircon, tourmaline, rutile) index. The ZTR index is higher in more\nweathered beaches, because these relatively rare and weather-resistant\nminerals become concentrated in older beaches. In some beaches, the\nZTR index is so high the sand can be harvested as an economically viable\nsource of these minerals. The beach environment has no sedimentary\nFigure 5.77: Lithified heavy mineral sand (dark layers)\nstructures, due to the constant bombardment of wave energy delivered from a beach deposit in India.\nby surf action. Beach sediment is moved around via multiple processes.\nSome beaches with high sediment supplies develop dunes nearby. 156 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nTidal Flats\nTidal flats, or mud flats, are sedimentary environments\nthat are regularly flooded and drained by ocean tides. Tidal\nflats have large areas of fine-grained sediment but may\nalso contain coarser sands. Tidal flat deposits typically\ncontain gradational sediments and may include multi-\ndirectional ripple marks. Mudcracks are also commonly\nseen due to the sediment being regularly exposed to air\nduring low tides; the combination of mudcracks and ripple\nmarks is distinctive to tidal flats.\nTidal water carries in sediment, sometimes focusing the\nflow through a narrow opening called a tidal inlet. Tidal\nchannels, creek channels influenced by tides, can also\nfocus tidally-induced flow. Areas of higher flow like inlets\nand tidal channels feature coarser grain sizes and larger\nFigure 5.78: General diagram of a tidal flat and associated features. ripples, which in some cases can develop into dunes.\nReefs\nReefs, which most people would immediately associate with tropical\ncoral reefs found in the oceans, are not only made by living things. Nat-\nural buildups of sand or rock can also create reefs, similar to barrier\nislands. Geologically speaking, a reef is any topographically-elevated\nfeature on the continental shelf, located oceanward of and separate\nfrom the beach. The term reef can also be applied to terrestrial (atop\nthe continental crust) features. Capitol Reef National Park in Utah con-\ntains a topographic barrier, a reef, called the Waterpocket Fold.\nFigure 5.79: Waterpocket fold, Capitol Reef National Park,\nUtah.\nMost reefs, now and in the geologic past, originate from the biological\nprocesses of living organisms. The growth habits of coral reefs provide geol-\nogists important information about the past. The hard structures in coral\nreefs are built by soft-bodied marine organisms, which continually add new\nmaterial and enlarge the reef over time. Under certain conditions, when the\nland beneath a reef is subsiding, the coral reef may grow around and\nthrough existing sediment, holding the sediment in place, and thus pre-\nserving the record of environmental and geological condition around it.\nFigure 5.80: A modern coral reef. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 157\nSediment found in coral reefs is typically fine-grained, mostly\ncarbonate, and tends to deposit between the intact coral skele-\ntons. Water with high levels of silt or clay particles can inhibit the\nreef growth because coral organisms require sunlight to thrive;\nthey host symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae that provide the\ncoral with nourishment via photosynthesis. Inorganic reef struc-\ntures have much more variable compositions. Reefs have a big\nimpact on sediment deposition in lagoon environments since\nthey are natural storm breaks, wave and storm buffers, which\nallows fine grains to settle and accumulate.\nFigure 5.81: The light blue reef is fringing the island of\nVanatinai. As the island erodes away, only the reef will remain,\nforming a reef-bound seamount.\nReefs are found around shorelines and islands; coral reefs\nare particularly common in tropical locations. Reefs are also\nfound around features known as seamounts, which is the\nbase of an ocean island left standing underwater after the\nupper part is eroded away by waves. Examples include the\nEmperor Seamounts, formed millions of years ago over the\nHawaiian Hotspot. Reefs live and grow along the upper edge\nof these flat-topped seamounts. If the reef builds up above\nFigure 5.82: Seamounts and guyots in the North Pacific.\nsea level and completely encircles the top of the seamount,\nit is called a coral-ringed atoll. If the reef is submerged, due to erosion, subsidence, or sea level rise, the seamount\u2013reef\nstructure is called a guyot.\nLagoons\nLagoons are small bodies of seawater located inland from the shore or isolated\nby another geographic feature, such as a reef or barrier island. Because they\nare protected from the action of tides, currents, and waves, lagoon environ-\nments typically have very fine grained sediments. Lagoons, as well as estuar-\nies, are ecosystems with high biological productivity. Rocks from these\nenvironments often includes bioturbation marks or coal deposits. Around\nlagoons where evaporation exceeds water inflow, salt flats, also known as\nsabkhas, and sand dune fields may develop at or above the high tide line.\nFigure 5.83: Kara-Bogaz Gol lagoon,\nTurkmenistan. 158 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nDeltas\nDeltas form where rivers enter lakes or oceans\nand are of three basic shapes: river-domi-\nnated deltas, wave-dominated deltas, and\ntide-dominated deltas. The name delta\ncomes from the Greek letter \u0394 (delta, upper-\ncase), which resembles the triangular shape of\nthe Nile River delta. The velocity of water flow\nis dependent on riverbed slope or gradient,\nwhich becomes shallower as the river\ndescends from the mountains. At the point\nwhere a river enters an ocean or lake, its slope\nangle drops to zero degrees (0\u00b0). The flow\nFigure 5.85: Birdfoot river-dominated\nvelocity quickly drops as well, and sediment is\ndelta of the Mississippi River.\nFigure 5.84: The Nile delta, in Egypt. deposited, from coarse clasts, to fine sand,\nand mud to form the delta. As one part of the delta becomes overwhelmed by sed-\niment, the slow-moving flow gets diverted back and forth, over and over, and forms a spread out network of smaller dis-\ntributary channels.\nDeltas are organized by the dominant process that controls their shape:\ntide-dominated, wave-dominated, or river-dominated. Wave-dominated\ndeltas generally have smooth coastlines and beach-ridges on the land that\nrepresent previous shorelines. The Nile River delta is a wave-dominated type\n(see figure 5.84).\nThe Mississippi River delta is a river-dominated delta. shaped by levees along\nthe river and its distributaries that confine the flow forming a shape called a\nbirdfoot delta. Other times the tides or the waves can be a bigger factor, and\ncan reshape the delta in various ways.\nA tide-dominated delta is dominated by tidal currents. During flood stages\nwhen rivers have lots of water available, it develops distributaries that are sep-\narated by sand bars and sand ridges. The tidal delta of the Ganges River is the\nFigure 5.86: Tidal delta of the Ganges River.\nlargest delta in the world.\n5.5.3 Terrestrial\nTerrestrial depositional environments are diverse. Water is a major factor in these environments, in liquid or frozen states,\nor even when it is lacking (arid conditions). WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 159\nFluvial\nFluvial (river) systems are formed by water flowing in channels over the land.\nThey generally come in two main varieties: meandering or braided. In mean-\ndering streams, the flow carries sediment grains via a single channel that\nwanders back and forth across the floodplain. The floodplain sediment\naway from the channel is mostly fine grained material that only gets deposited\nduring floods.\nBraided fluvial systems gener-\nally contain coarser sediment\ngrains, and form a complicated\nseries of intertwined channels\nFigure 5.87: The Cauto River in Cuba. Note the\nthat flow around gravel and\nsinuosity in the river, which is meandering.\nsand bars (see chapter 11).\nFigure 5.88: The braided Waimakariri river in New\nZealand.\nAlluvial\nA distinctive characteristic of alluvial systems is the intermittent flow of water.\nAlluvial deposits are common in arid places with little soil development.\nLithified alluvial beds are the primary basin-filling rock found throughout the\nBasin and Range region of the western United States. The most distinctive\nalluvial sedimentary deposit is the alluvial fan, a large cone of sediment\nformed by streams flowing out of dry mountain valleys into a wider and more\nopen dry area. Alluvial sediments are typically poorly sorted and coarse\ngrained, and often found near playa lakes or aeolian deposits (see chapter\n13).\nFigure 5.89: An alluvial fan spreads out into a\nbroad alluvial plain. From Red Rock Canyon State\nPark, California.\nLacustrine\nLake systems and deposits, called lacustrine, form via processes some-\nwhat similar to marine deposits, but on a much smaller scale. Lacustrine\ndeposits are found in lakes in a wide variety of locations. Lake Baikal in\nsoutheast Siberia (Russia) is in a tectonic basin. Crater Lake (Oregon) sits\nin a volcanic caldera. The Great Lakes (northern United States) came\nfrom glacially carved and deposited sediment. Ancient Lake Bonneville\n(Utah) formed in a pluvial setting that during a climate that was relatively\nwetter and cooler than that of modern Utah. Oxbow lakes, named for\ntheir curved shape, originated in fluvial floodplains. Lacustrine sediment\ntends to be very fine grained and thinly laminated, with only minor contri-\nbutions from wind-blown, current, and tidal deposits. When lakes dry out\nFigure 5.90: Oregon\u2019s Crater Lake was formed about\nor evaporation outpaces precipitation, playas form. Playa deposits 7700 years ago after the eruption of Mount Mazama. 160 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nresemble those of normal lake deposits but contain more evaporite minerals. Certain tidal flats can have playa-type\ndeposits as well.\nPaludal\nPaludal systems include bogs, marshes, swamps, or other wetlands, and usually contain lots of organic matter. Paludal\nsystems typically develop in coastal environments, but are common occur in humid, low-lying, low-latitude, warm zones\nwith large volumes of flowing water. A characteristic paludal deposit is a peat bog, a deposit rich in organic matter that\ncan be converted into coal when lithified. Paludal environments may be associated with tidal, deltaic, lacustrine, and/or\nfluvial deposition.\nAeolian\nAeolian, sometimes spelled eolian or \u0153olian, are deposits\nof windblown sediments. Since wind has a much lower\ncarrying capacity than water, aeolian deposits typically\nconsists of clast sizes from fine dust to sand. Fine silt and\nclay can cross very long distances, even entire oceans sus-\npended in air.\nWith sufficient sediment influx, aeolian systems can\npotentially form large dunes in dry or wet conditions. The\nfigure shows dune features and various types. British geol-\nogist Ralph A. Bagnold (1896-1990) considered only\nBarchan and linear Seif dunes as the only true dune forms.\nOther scientists recognize transverse, star, parabolic, and\nlinear dune types. Parabolic and linear dunes grow from\nsand anchored by plants and are common in coastal areas.\nFigure 5.91: Formation and types of dunes.\nCompacted layers of wind-blown sediment is known as loess.\nLoess commonly starts as finely ground up rock flour created by\nglaciers. Such deposits cover thousands of square miles in the\nMidwestern United States. Loess may also form in desert regions Figure 5.92: Loess Plateau in China. The loess is so highly\ncompacted that buildings and homes have been carved in it.\n(see chapter 13). Silt for the Loess Plateau in China came from the\nGobi Desert in China and Mongolia. WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS | 161\nGlacial\nGlacial sedimentation is very diverse, and generally consists of the most\npoorly-sorted sediment deposits found in nature. The main clast type is\ncalled diamictite, which literally means two sizes, referring to the unsorted\nmix of large and small rock fragments found in glacial deposits. Many\nglacial tills, glacially derived diamictites, include very finely-pulverized\nrock flour along with giant erratic boulders. The surfaces of larger clasts\ntypically have striations from the rubbing, scraping, and polishing of sur-\nfaces by abrasion during the movement of glacial ice. Glacial systems are\nso large and produce so much sediment, they frequently create multiple,\nindividualized depositional environments, such as fluvial, deltaic, lacus-\ntrine, pluvial, alluvial, and/or aeolian (see chapter 14). Figure 5.93: Wide range of sediments near Athabaska\nGlacier, Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada.\n5.5.4 Facies\nIn addition to mineral composition and lithification process, geologists also classify sedimentary rock by its depositional\ncharacteristics, collectively called facies or lithofacies. Sedimentary facies consist of physical, chemical, and/or biological\nproperties, including relative changes in these properties in adjacent beds of the same layer or geological age. Geologists\nanalyze sedimentary rock facies to interpret the original deposition environment, as well as disruptive geological events\nthat may have occurred after the rock layers were established.\nIt boggles the imagination to think of all the sedimentary deposition environments working next to each other, at the same\ntime, in any particular region on Earth. The resulting sediment beds develop characteristics reflecting contemporaneous\nconditions at the time of deposition, which later may become preserved into the rock record. For example in the Grand\nCanyon, rock strata of the same geologic age includes many different depositional environments: beach sand, tidal flat\nsilt, offshore mud, and farther offshore limestone. In other words, each sedimentary or stratigraphic facies presents rec-\nognizable characteristics that reflect specific, and different, depositional environments that were present at the same time.\nFacies may also reflect depositional changes in the same location over time. During periods of rising sea level, called\nmarine transgression, the shoreline moves inland as seawater covers what was originally dry land and creates new off-\nshore depositional environments. When these sediment beds turn into sedimentary rock, the vertical stratigraphy\nsequence reveals beach lithofacies buried by offshore lithofacies.\nBiological facies are remnants (coal, diatomaceous earth) or evidence (fossils) of living organisms. Index fossils, fossilized\nlife forms specific to a particular environment and/or geologic time period, are an example of biological facies. The hori-\nzontal assemblage and vertical distribution of fossils are particularly useful for studying species evolution because trans-\ngression, deposition, burial, and compaction processes happen over a considerable geologic time range.\nFossil assemblages that show evolutionary changes greatly enhance our interpretation of Earth\u2019s ancient history by illus-\ntrating the correlation between stratigraphic sequence and geologic time scale. During the Middle Cambrian period (see\nchapter 7), regions around the Grand Canyon experienced marine transgression in a southeasterly direction (relative to\ncurrent maps). This shift of the shoreline is reflected in the Tapeats Sandstone beach facies, Bright Angle Shale near-off-\nshore mud facies, and Muav Limestone far-offshore facies. Marine organisms had plenty of time to evolve and adapt to\ntheir slowly changing environment; these changes are reflected in the biological facies, which show older life forms in the\nwestern regions of the canyon and younger life forms in the east. 162 | WEATHERING, EROSION, AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 5.5 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Clastic (detrital) rocks are made\nof mineral clasts or sediment that lithifies into solid material. Sediment is produced by the mechanical or chemical\nweathering of bedrock and transported away from the source via erosion. Sediment that is deposited, buried, com-\npacted, and sometimes cemented becomes clastic rock. Clastic rocks are classified by grain size; for example sandstone\nis made of sand-sized particles. Chemical sedimentary rocks comes from minerals precipitated out an aqueous solution\nand is classified according to mineral composition. The chemical sedimentary rock limestone is made of calcium car-\nbonate. Sedimentary structures have textures and shapes that give insight on depositional histories. Depositional envi-\nronments depend mainly on fluid transport systems and encompass a wide variety of underwater and above ground\nconditions. Geologists analyze depositional conditions, sedimentary structures, and rock records to interpret the paleogeo-\ngraphic history of a region.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 5 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Metamorphic rock material\nhas been changed by temperature, pressure, and/or flu-\nids. The rock cycle shows that both igneous and sedimen-\ntary rocks can become metamorphic rocks. And\nmetamorphic rocks themselves can be re-metamor-\nphosed. Because metamorphism is caused by plate tec-\ntonic motion, metamorphic rock provides geologists with\na history book of how past tectonic processes shaped our\nplanet.\n6.1 Metamorphic Processes\nMetamorphism occurs when solid rock changes in com-\nFigure 6.1: Rock cycle showing the five materials (such as igneous rocks\nposition and/or texture without the mineral crystals melt-\nand sediment) and the processes by which one changes into another\ning, which is how igneous rock is generated. Metamorphic (such as weathering).\nsource rocks, the rocks that experience the metamor-\nphism, are called the parent rock or protolith, from proto\u2013 meaning first, and lithos- meaning rock. Most metamorphic\nprocesses take place deep underground, inside the earth\u2019s crust. During metamorphism, protolith chemistry is mildly METAMORPHIC ROCKS | 171\nchanged by increased temperature (heat), a type of pressure called confining pressure, and/or chemically reactive fluids.\nRock texture is changed by heat, confining pressure, and a type of pressure called directed stress.\n6.1.1 Temperature (Heat)\nTemperature measures a substance\u2019s energy\u2014an increase in temperature represents an increase in energy. Temperature\nchanges affect the chemical equilibrium or cation balance in minerals. At high temperatures atoms may vibrate so vig-\norously they jump from one position to another within the crystal lattice, which remains intact. In other words, this atom\nswapping can happen while the rock is still solid.\nThe temperatures of metamorphic rock lies in between surficial processes (as in sedimentary rock) and magma in the\nrock cycle. Heat-driven metamorphism begins at temperatures as cold as 200\u02daC, and can continue to occur at temper-\natures as high as 700\u00b0C-1,100\u00b0C. Higher temperatures would create magma, and thus, would no longer be a metamor-\nphic process. Temperature increases with increasing depth in the Earth along a geothermal gradient (see chapter 4) and\nmetamorphic rock records these depth-related temperature changes.\n6.1.2 Pressure\nPressure is the force exerted over a unit area on a material. Like heat, pressure can affect the chemical equilibrium of min-\nerals in a rock. The pressure that affects metamorphic rocks can be grouped into confining pressure and directed stress.\nStress is a scientific term indicating a force. Strain is the result of this stress, including metamorphic changes within min-\nerals.\nConfining Pressure\nPressure exerted on rocks under the surface is due to the\nsimple fact that rocks lie on top of one another. When pres-\nsure is exerted from rocks above, it is balanced from below\nand sides, and is called confining or lithostatic pressure.\nConfining pressure has equal pressure on all sides (see fig-\nure 6.2) and is responsible for causing chemical reactions\nto occur just like heat. These chemical reactions will cause\nnew minerals to form.\nConfining pressure is measured in bars and ranges from 1\nbar at sea level to around 10,000 bars at the base of the\ncrust. For metamorphic rocks, pressures range from a rel-\natively low-pressure of 3,000 bars around 50,000 bars,\nwhich occurs around 15-35 kilometers below the surface.\nFigure 6.2: Difference between pressure and stress and how they\ndeform rocks. Pressure (or confining pressure) has equal stress (forces)\nin all directions and increases with depth under the Earth\u2019s surface.\nUnder directed stress, some stress directions (forces) are stronger than\nothers, and this can deform rocks. 172 | METAMORPHIC ROCKS\nDirected Stress\nDirected stress, also called differential or tectonic stress, is an unequal balance of\nforces on a rock in one or more directions (see previous figure). Directed stresses are\ngenerated by the movement of lithospheric plates. Stress indicates a type of force\nacting on rock. Strain describes the resultant processes caused by stress and\nincludes metamorphic changes in the minerals. In contrast to confining pressure,\ndirected stress occurs at much lower pressures and does not generate chemical\nreactions that change mineral composition and atomic structure. Instead, directed\nstress modifies the parent rock at a mechanical level, changing the arrangement,\nsize, and/or shape of the mineral crystals. These crystalline changes create identify-\nFigure 6.3: Pebbles (that used to be\ning textures, which is shown in the figure below comparing the phaneritic texture of\nspherical or close to spherical) in\nigneous granite with the foliated texture of metamorphic gneiss. quartzite deformed by directed stress.\nDirected stresses produce rock textures in many ways.\nCrystals are rotated, changing their orientation in space.\nCrystals can get fractured, reducing their grain size. Con-\nversely, they may grow larger as atoms migrate. Crystal\nshapes also become deformed. These mechanical\nchanges occur via recrystallization, which is when miner-\nals dissolve from an area of rock experiencing high stress\nFigure 6.4: An igneous rock granite (left) and foliated high-temperature\nand high-pressure metamorphic rock gneiss (right) illustrating a and precipitate or regrow in a location having lower stress.\nmetamorphic texture. For example, recrystallization increases grain size much\nlike adjacent soap bubbles coalesce to form larger ones.\nRecrystallization rearranges mineral crystals without fracturing the rock structure, deforming the rock like silly putty; these\nchanges provide important clues to understanding the creation and movement of deep underground rock faults.\n6.1.3 Fluids\nA third metamorphic agent is chemically reactive fluids that are expelled by crystallizing magma and created by meta-\nmorphic reactions. These reactive fluids are made of mostly water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), and smaller amounts of\npotassium (K), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and aluminum (Al). These fluids react with minerals in\nthe protolith, changing its chemical equilibrium and mineral composition, in a process similar to the reactions driven by\nheat and pressure. In addition to using elements found in the protolith, the chemical reaction may incorporate substances\ncontributed by the fluids to create new minerals. In general, this style of metamorphism, in which fluids play an important\nrole, is called hydrothermal metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration. Water actively participates in chemical reactions\nand allows extra mobility of the components in hydrothermal alteration.\nFluids-activated metamorphism is frequently involved in creating economically important mineral deposits that are\nlocated next to igneous intrusions or magma bodies. For example, the mining districts in the Cottonwood Canyons and\nMineral Basin of northern Utah produce valuable ores such as argentite (silver sulfide), galena (lead sulfide), and chal-\ncopyrite (copper iron sulfide), as well as the native element gold. These mineral deposits were created from the interac-\ntion between a granitic intrusion called the Little Cottonwood Stock and country rock consisting of mostly limestone and\ndolostone. Hot, circulating fluids expelled by the crystallizing granite reacted with and dissolved the surrounding lime-\nstone and dolostone, precipitating out new minerals created by the chemical reaction. Hydrothermal alternation of mafic\nmantle rock, such as olivine and basalt, creates the metamorphic rock serpentinite, a member of the serpentine sub-\ngroup of minerals. This metamorphic process happens at mid-ocean spreading centers where newly formed oceanic\ncrust interacts with seawater. METAMORPHIC ROCKS | 173\nSome hydrothermal alterations remove elements from the parent rock rather than deposit\nthem. This happens when seawater circulates down through fractures in the fresh, still-hot\nbasalt, reacting with and removing mineral ions from it. The dissolved minerals are usually\nions that do not fit snugly in the silicate crystal structure, such as copper. The mineral-laden\nwater emerges from the sea floor via hydrothermal vents called black smokers, named\nafter the dark-colored precipitates produced when the hot vent water meets cold seawater\n(see chapter 4). Ancient black smokers were an important source of copper ore for the\ninhabitants of Cyprus (Cypriots) as early as 4,000 BCE, and later by the Romans.\nFigure 6.5: Black smoker\nhydrothermal vent with a colony\nof giant (6\u2019+) tube worms.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 6.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

METAMORPHIC ROCKS | 175\n6.2.1 Foliation and Lineation\nFoliation is a term used that describes minerals lined up in planes. Certain minerals, most notably the mica group, are\nmostly thin and planar by default. Foliated rocks typically appear as if the minerals are stacked like pages of a book, thus\nthe use of the term \u2018folia\u2019, like a leaf. Other minerals, with hornblende being a good example, are longer in one direction, lin-\near like a pencil or a needle, rather than a planar-shaped book. These linear objects can also be aligned within a rock. This\nis referred to as a lineation. Linear crystals, such as hornblende, tourmaline, or stretched quartz grains, can be arranged\nas part of a foliation, a lineation, or foliation/lineation together. If they lie on a plane with mica, but with no common or\npreferred direction, this is foliation. If the minerals line up and point in a common direction, but with no planar fabric, this\nis lineation. When minerals lie on a plane AND point in a common direction; this is both foliation and lineation.\nFigure 6.6: Example of lineation where minerals are aligned like a stack of\nstraws or pencils.\nFigure 6.7: An example of foliation WITH lineation.\nFigure 6.8: An example of foliation WITHOUT lineation. 176 | METAMORPHIC ROCKS\nFoliated metamorphic rocks are named based on the style of their\nfoliations. Each rock name has a specific texture that defines and\ndistinguishes it, with their descriptions listed below.\nSlate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that exhibits a foliation\ncalled slaty cleavage that is the flat orientation of the small platy\ncrystals of mica and chlorite forming perpendicular to the direction\nof stress. The minerals in slate are too small to see with the\nunaided eye. The thin layers in slate may resemble sedimentary\nbedding, but they are a result of directed stress and may lie at\nangles to the original strata. In fact, original sedimentary layering\nmay be partially or completely obscured by the foliation. Thin slabs\nof slate are often used as a building material for roofs and tiles.\nFigure 6.9: Rock breaking along flat even planes.\nFigure 6.10: Foliation versus bedding. Foliation is caused by\nmetamorphism. Bedding is a result of sedimentary processes.\nThey do not have to align.\nPhyllite is a foliated metamorphic rock in which platy minerals have\ngrown larger and the surface of the foliation shows a sheen from light\nreflecting from the grains, perhaps even a wavy appearance, called crenu-\nlations. Similar to phyllite but with even larger grains is the foliated meta-\nmorphic rock schist, which has large platy grains visible as individual\ncrystals. Common minerals are muscovite, biotite, and porphyroblasts of\ngarnets. A porphyroblast is a large crystal of a particular mineral sur-\nrounded by small grains. Schistosity is a textural description of foliation\ncreated by the parallel alignment of platy visible grains. Some schists are\nnamed for their minerals such as mica schist (mostly micas), garnet schist\n(mica schist with garnets), and staurolite schist (mica schists with stauro-\nlite). Figure 6.11: Phyllite with a small fold. METAMORPHIC ROCKS | 177\nFigure 6.12: Schist.\nFigure 6.13: Garnet staurolite muscovite schist.\nFigure 6.14: Gneiss.\nGneissic banding is a metamorphic foliation in which visible silicate minerals separate into dark and light bands or lin-\neations. These grains tend to be coarse and often folded. A rock with this texture is called gneiss. Since gneisses form at\nthe highest temperatures and pressures, some partial melting may occur. This partially melted rock is a transition between\nmetamorphic and igneous rocks called a migmatite. 178 | METAMORPHIC ROCKS\nMigmatites appear as dark and light banded gneiss that may be swirled or\ntwisted some since some minerals started to melt. Thin accumulations of\nlight colored rock layers can occur in a darker rock that are parallel to each\nother, or even cut across the gneissic foliation. The lighter colored layers\nare interpreted to be the result of the separation of a felsic igneous melt\nfrom the adjacent highly metamorphosed darker layers, or injection of a fel-\nsic melt from some distance away.\n6.2.2 Non-foliated\nNon-foliated textures do not have lin-\neations, foliations, or other alignments Figure 6.15: Migmatite, a rock which was partially\nmolten.\nof mineral grains. Non-foliated meta-\nmorphic rocks are typically composed of just one mineral, and therefore, usually\nshow the effects of metamorphism with recrystallization in which crystals grow\ntogether, but with no preferred direction. The two most common examples of non-foli-\nated rocks are quartzite and marble. Quartzite is a metamorphic rock from the pro-\ntolith sandstone. In quartzites, the quartz grains from the original sandstone are\nFigure 6.16: Marble. enlarged and interlocked by recrystallization. A defining characteristic for distinguish-\ning quartzite from sandstone is that when broken with a rock hammer, the quartz\ncrystals break across the grains. In a sandstone, only a thin mineral cement holds the grains together, meaning that a bro-\nken piece of sandstone will leave the grains intact. Because most sandstones are rich in quartz, and quartz is a mechan-\nically and chemically durable substance, quartzite is very hard and resistant to weathering.\nFigure 6.17: Baraboo quartzite.\nMarble is metamorphosed limestone (or dolostone) composed of calcite (or\ndolomite). Recrystallization typically generates larger interlocking crystals of\ncalcite or dolomite. Marble and quartzite often look similar, but these minerals\nare considerably softer than quartz. Another way to distinguish marble from\nquartzite is with a drop of dilute hydrochloric acid. Marble will effervesce (fizz) if\nit is made of calcite.\nA third non-foliated rock is hornfels identified by its dense, fine grained, hard,\nblocky or splintery texture composed of several silicate minerals. Crystals in\nhornfels grow smaller with metamorphism, and become so small that special-\nized study is required to identify them. These are common around intrusive\nigneous bodies and are hard to identify. The protolith of hornfels can be even\nFigure 6.18: Macro view of quartzite. Note the\nharder to distinguish, which can be anything from mudstone to basalt. interconnectedness of the grains.

Low-grade metamorphism begins at\ntemperatures and pressures just above sedimentary rock conditions. The\nsequence slate\u2192phyllite\u2192schist\u2192gneiss illustrates an increasing metamor-\nphic grade.\nGeologists use index minerals that form at certain temperatures and pressures\nto identify metamorphic grade. These index minerals also provide important\nclues to a rock\u2019s sedimentary protolith and the metamorphic conditions that\ncreated it. Chlorite, muscovite, biotite, garnet, and staurolite are index miner-\nFigure 6.20: Garnet schist.\nals representing a respective sequence of low-to-high grade rock. The figure\nshows a phase diagram of three index minerals\u2014sillimanite, kyanite, and andalusite\u2014with the same chemical formula\n(Al2SiO5) but having different crystal structures (polymorphism) created by different pressure and temperature conditions. 180 | METAMORPHIC ROCKS\nComplete this interactive activity to check your understanding.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this interactive activity via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Chlorite schist includes the\nlow-grade index mineral chlorite. Muscovite schist contains the slightly higher grade muscovite, indicating a greater\ndegree of metamorphism. Garnet schist includes the high grade index mineral garnet, and indicating it has experienced\nmuch higher pressures and temperatures than chlorite.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 6.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The term facies is an objective description of a rock. In metamorphic rocks\nfacies are groups of minerals called mineral assemblages. The names of metamorphic facies on the pressure-tempera-\nture diagram reflect minerals and mineral assemblages that are stable at these pressures and temperatures and provide\ninformation about the metamorphic processes that have affected the rocks. This is useful when interpreting the history of\na metamorphic rock. METAMORPHIC ROCKS | 181\nFigure 6.21: Pressure\u2013temperature graphs of various metamorphic facies.\nIn the late 1800s, British geologist George Barrow mapped zones of index minerals in different metamorphic zones of\nan area that underwent regional metamorphism. Barrow outlined a progression of index minerals, named the Barrovian\nSequence, that represents increasing metamorphic grade: chlorite (slates and phyllites) -> biotite (phyllites and schists) ->\ngarnet (schists) -> staurolite (schists) -> kyanite (schists) -> sillimanite (schists and gneisses).\nThe first of the Barrovian sequence has a mineral group\nthat is commonly found in the metamorphic greenschist\nfacies. Greenschist rocks form under relatively low pres-\nsure and temperatures and represent the fringes of\nregional metamorphism. The \u201cgreen\u201d part of the name is\nderived from green minerals like chlorite, serpentine, and\nepidote, and the \u201cschist\u201d part is applied due to the pres-\nence of platy minerals such as muscovite.\nMany different styles of metamorphic facies are recog-\nnized, tied to different geologic and tectonic processes.\nRecognizing these facies is the most direct way to interpret\nthe metamorphic history of a rock. A simplified list of major\nmetamorphic facies is given below.\nFigure 6.22: Barrovian sequence in Scotland.\n6.4.1 Burial Metamorphism\nBurial metamorphism occurs when rocks are deeply buried, at depths of more than 2000 meters (1.24 miles). Burial meta-\nmorphism commonly occurs in sedimentary basins, where rocks are buried deeply by overlying sediments. As an exten-\nsion of diagenesis, a process that occurs during lithification (chapter 5), burial metamorphism can cause clay minerals,\nsuch as smectite, in shales to change to another clay mineral illite. Or it can cause quartz sandstone to metamorphose\ninto the quartzite such the Big Cottonwood Formation in the Wasatch Range of Utah. This formation was deposited as 182 | METAMORPHIC ROCKS\nancient near-shore sands in the late Proterozoic (see chapter 7), deeply buried and metamorphosed to quartzite, folded,\nand later exposed at the surface in the Wasatch Range today. Increase of temperature with depth in combination with an\nincrease of confining pressure produces low-grade metamorphic rocks with a mineral assemblages indicative of a zeo-\nlite facies.\n6.4.2 Contact Metamorphism\nContact metamorphism occurs in rock exposed to high temperature and low pressure, as might happen when hot\nmagma intrudes into or lava flows over pre-existing protolith. This combination of high temperature and low pressure\nproduces numerous metamorphic facies. The lowest pressure conditions produce hornfels facies, while higher pressure\ncreates greenschist, amphibolite, or granulite facies.\nAs with all metamorphic rock, the parent rock texture and chemistry are major factors in determining the final outcome\nof the metamorphic process, including what index minerals are present. Fine-grained shale and basalt, which happen to\nbe chemically similar, characteristically recrystallize to produce hornfels. Sandstone (silica) surrounding an igneous intru-\nsion becomes quartzite via contact metamorphism, and limestone (carbonate) becomes marble.\nWhen contact metamorphism occurs deeper in the Earth, meta-\nmorphism can be seen as rings of facies around the intrusion, result-\ning in aureoles. These differences in metamorphism appear as\ndistinct bands surrounding the intrusion, as can be seen around the\nAlta Stock in Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah. The Alta Stock is a\ngranite intrusion surrounded first by rings of the index minerals\namphibole (tremolite) and olivine (forsterite), with a ring of talc (dolo-\nstone) located further away.\n6.4.3 Regional Metamorphism\nRegional metamorphism occurs when parent rock is subjected to\nFigure 6.23: Contact metamorphism in outcrop.\nincreased temperature and pressure over a large area, and is often\nlocated in mountain ranges created by converging continental\ncrustal plates. This is the setting for the Barrovian sequence of rock facies, with the lowest grade of metamorphism\noccurring on the flanks of the mountains and highest grade near the core of the mountain range, closest to the conver-\ngent boundary.\nAn example of an old regional metamorphic environment is visible in the northern Appalachian Mountains while driving\neast from New York state through Vermont and into New Hampshire. Along this route the degree of metamorphism grad-\nually increases from sedimentary parent rock, to low-grade metamorphic rock, then higher-grade metamorphic rock,\nand eventually the igneous core. The rock sequence is sedimentary rock, slate, phyllite, schist, gneiss, migmatite, and\ngranite. In fact, New Hampshire is nicknamed the Granite State. The reverse sequence can be seen heading east, from\neastern New Hampshire to the coast. METAMORPHIC ROCKS | 183\n6.4.4 Subduction Zone Metamorphism\nSubduction zone metamorphism is a type of regional metamorphism\nthat occurs when a slab of oceanic crust is subducted under continental\ncrust (see chapter 2). Because rock is a good insulator, the temperature\nof the descending oceanic slab increases slowly relative to the more\nrapidly increasing pressure, creating a metamorphic environment of high\npressure and low temperature. Glaucophane, which has a distinctive blue\ncolor, is an index mineral found in blueschist facies (see metamorphic\nfacies diagram). The California Coast Range near San Francisco has\nblueschist\u2013facies rocks created by subduction-zone metamorphism,\nwhich include rocks made of blueschist, greenstone, and red chert.\nGreenstone, which is metamorphized basalt, gets its color from the index\nmineral chlorite. Figure 6.24: Blueschist.\n6.4.5 Fault Metamorphism\nThere are a range of metamorphic rocks made along faults.\nNear the surface, rocks are involved in repeated brittle fault-\ning produce a material called rock flour, which is rock ground\nup to the particle size of flour used for food. At lower depths,\nfaulting create cataclastites, chaotically-crushed mixes of rock\nmaterial with little internal texture. At depths below catacla-\nsites, where strain becomes ductile, mylonites are formed.\nMylonites are metamorphic rocks created by dynamic recrys-\nFigure 6.25: Mylonite.\ntallization through directed shear forces, generally resulting in\na reduction of grain size. When larger, stronger crystals (like feldspar, quartz, garnet) embedded in a metamorphic matrix\nare sheared into an asymmetrical eye-shaped crystal, an augen is formed.\nFigure 6.26: Examples of augens. 184 | METAMORPHIC ROCKS\n6.4.6 Shock Metamorphism\nShock (also known as impact) metamorphism is metamorphism resulting from meteor\nor other bolide impacts, or from a similar high-pressure shock event. Shock metamor-\nphism is the result of very high pressures (and higher, but less extreme temperatures)\ndelivered relatively rapidly. Shock metamorphism produces planar deformation fea-\ntures, tektites, shatter cones, and quartz polymorphs. Shock metamorphism produces\nplanar deformation features (shock laminae), which are narrow planes of glassy mate-\nrial with distinct orientations found in silicate mineral grains. Shocked quartz has planar\ndeformation features.\nShatter cones are cone-shaped pieces of rock\nFigure 6.27: Shock lamellae in a quartz\ncreated by dynamic branching fractures caused grain.\nby impacts. While not strictly a metamorphic\nstructure, they are common around shock metamorphism. Their diameter can\nrange from microscopic to several meters. Fine-grained rocks with shatter cones\nshow a distinctive horsetail pattern.\nShock metamorphism can also produce index minerals, though they are typically\nonly found via microscopic analysis. The quartz polymorphs coesite and stishovite\nFigure 6.28: Shatter cone.\nare indicative of impact metamorphism. As discussed in chapter 3, polymorphs\nare minerals with the same composition but different crystal structures. Intense\npressure (> 10 GPa) and moderate to high temperatures (700-1200 \u00b0C) are required to form these minerals.\nShock metamorphism can also produce glass. Tektites are gravel-size glass grains\nejected during an impact event. They resemble volcanic glass but, unlike volcanic\nglass, tektites contain no water or phenocrysts, and have a different bulk and isotopic\nchemistry. Tektites contain partially melted inclusions of shocked mineral grains.\nAlthough all are melt glasses, tektites are also chemically distinct from trinitite, which\nis produced from thermonuclear detonations, and fulgurites, which are produced by\nlightning strikes. All geologic glasses not derived from volcanoes can be called with\nthe general term pseudotachylytes, a name which can also be applied to glasses cre- Figure 6.29: Tektites.\nated by faulting. The term pseudo in this context means \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018in the appearance\nof\u2019, a volcanic rock called tachylite because the material observed looks like a volcanic rock, but is produced by significant\nshear heating.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 6.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Increases in temperature and pressure are the main causes of metamorphism, with fluids adding important\nmobilization of materials. The primary way metamorphic rocks are identified is with texture. Foliated textures come from\nplaty minerals forming planes in a rock, while non-foliated metamorphic rocks have no internal fabric. Grade describes\nthe amount of metamorphism in a rock, and facies are a set of minerals that can help guide an observer to an interpre-\ntation of the metamorphic history of a rock. Different tectonic or geologic environments cause metamorphism, including\ncollisions, subduction, faulting, and even impacts from space. 186 | METAMORPHIC ROCKS\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 6 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Working out Earth\u2019s history depended on realizing some key\nprinciples of relative time. Nicolas Steno (1638-1686) introduced basic principles of\nstratigraphy, the study of layered rocks, in 1669. William Smith (1769-1839), working\nwith the strata of English coal mines, noticed that strata and their sequence were con-\nsistent throughout the region. Eventually he produced the first national geologic map of\nBritain, becoming known as \u201cthe Father of English Geology.\u201d Nineteenth-century scien-\ntists developed a relative time scale using Steno\u2019s principles, with names derived from\nthe characteristics of the rocks in those areas. The figure of this geologic time scale\nshows the names of the units and subunits. Using this time scale, geologists can place\nall events of Earth history in order without ever knowing their numerical ages. The spe-\ncific events within Earth history are discussed in chapter 8.\nFigure 7.1: Nicolas Steno, c. 1670. 190 | GEOLOGIC TIME\n7.1 Relative Dating\nFigure 7.2: Geologic time scale.\nRelative dating is the process of determining if one rock or geologic event is older or younger than another, without know-\ning their specific ages\u2014i.e., how many years ago the object was formed. The principles of relative time are simple, even\nobvious now, but were not generally accepted by scholars until the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nJames Hutton (see chapter 1) realized geologic processes are slow and his ideas on uniformitarianism (i.e., \u201cthe present is\nthe key to the past\u201d) provided a basis for interpreting rocks of the Earth using scientific principles.\n7.1.1 Relative Dating Principles\nStratigraphy is the study of layered sedimentary rocks. This section discusses\nprinciples of relative time used in all of geology, but are especially useful in\nstratigraphy.\nPrinciple of Superposition: In an otherwise undisturbed sequence of sedi-\nmentary strata, or rock layers, the layers on the bottom are the oldest and\nlayers above them are younger.\nPrinciple of Original Horizontality: Layers of rocks deposited from above,\nsuch as sediments and lava flows, are originally laid down horizontally. The\nexception to this principle is at the margins of basins, where the strata can\nslope slightly downward into the basin.\nFigure 7.3: Lower strata are older than those lying\non top of them. GEOLOGIC TIME | 191\nFigure 7.4: Lateral continuity.\nPrinciple of Lateral Continuity: Within the depositional basin, strata are continuous\nin all directions until they thin out at the edge of that basin. Of course, all strata even-\ntually end, either by hitting a geographic barrier, such as a ridge, or when the deposi-\ntional process extends too far from its source, either a sediment source or a volcano.\nStrata that are cut by a canyon later remain continuous on either side of the canyon.\nPrinciple of Cross-Cutting Relationships: Deformation events like folds, faults and\nigneous intrusions that cut across rocks are younger than the rocks they cut across.\nPrinciple of Inclusions: When one rock formation contains pieces or inclusions of\nanother rock, the included rock is older than the host rock.\nPrinciple of Fossil Succession: Evolution has produced a succession of unique fos-\nsils that correlate to the units of the geologic time scale. Assemblages of fossils con-\ntained in strata are unique to the time they lived, and can be used to correlate rocks\nof the same age across a wide geographic distribution. Assemblages of fossils refers\nto groups of several unique fossils occurring together. Figure 7.5: Dark dike cutting across older\nrocks, the lighter of which is younger\nthan the grey rock.\nFigure 7.6: Fossil succession showing correlation among\nstrata. 192 | GEOLOGIC TIME\n7.1.2 Grand Canyon Example\nFigure 7.7: The Grand Canyon of Arizona.\nThe Grand Canyon of Arizona illustrates the stratigraphic principles. The photo shows layers of rock on top of one another\nin order, from the oldest at the bottom to the youngest at the top, based on the principle of superposition. The predom-\ninant white layer just below the canyon rim is the Coconino Sandstone. This layer is laterally continuous, even though the\nintervening canyon separates its outcrops. The rock layers exhibit the principle of lateral continuity, as they are found on\nboth sides of the Grand Canyon which has been carved by the Colorado River.\nThe diagram called \u201cGrand Canyon\u2019s Three Sets of Rocks\u201d\nshows a cross-section of the rocks exposed on the walls of\nthe Grand Canyon, illustrating the principle of cross-cut-\nting relationships, superposition, and original horizon-\ntality. In the lowest parts of the Grand Canyon are the\noldest sedimentary formations, with igneous and meta-\nmorphic rocks at the bottom. The principle of cross-cut-\nting relationships shows the sequence of these events.\nThe metamorphic schist (#16) is the oldest rock formation\nand the cross-cutting granite intrusion (#17) is younger. As\nseen in the figure, the other layers on the walls of the Grand\nCanyon are numbered in reverse order with #15 being the\noldest and #1 the youngest. This illustrates the principle of\nsuperposition. The Grand Canyon region lies in Colorado\nPlateau, which is characterized by horizontal or nearly hor-\nizontal strata, which follows the principle of original hori-\nzontality. These rock strata have been barely disturbed\nfrom their original deposition, except by a broad regional\nuplift.\nFigure 7.8: The rocks of the Grand Canyon. GEOLOGIC TIME | 193\nThe photo of the Grand Canyon here show strata that were originally\ndeposited in a flat layer on top of older igneous and metamorphic\n\u201cbasement\u201d rocks, per the original horizontality principle. Because\nthe formation of the basement rocks and the deposition of the\noverlying strata is not continuous but broken by events of metamor-\nphism, intrusion, and erosion, the contact between the strata and\nthe older basement is termed an unconformity. An unconformity\nrepresents a period during which deposition did not occur or ero-\nsion removed rock that had been deposited, so there are no rocks\nthat represent events of Earth history during that span of time at that\nplace. Unconformities appear in cross sections and stratigraphic\ncolumns as wavy lines between formations. Unconformities are dis-\ncussed in the next section.\nFigure 7.9: The red, layered rocks of the Grand Canyon\nSupergroup overlying the dark-colored rocks of the Vishnu\n7.1.3 Unconformities schist represents a type of unconformity called a\nnonconformity.\nThere are three types of unconformities, nonconformity, disconfor-\nmity, and angular unconformity.

Disconformities are\nunconformities that occur between parallel layers of strata indicating\neither a period of no deposition or erosion.\nThe Phanerozoic strata in most of the Grand Canyon are horizontal.\nHowever, near the bottom horizontal strata overlie tilted strata. This is\nknown as the Great Unconformity and is an example of an angular\nunconformity. The lower strata were tilted by tectonic processes that\ndisturbed their original horizontality and caused the strata to be\neroded. Later, horizontal strata were deposited on top of the tilted strata\ncreating the angular unconformity.\nHere are three graphical illustrations of the three types of unconformity.\nFigure 7.11: In the lower part of the picture is an angular\nunconformity in the Grand Canyon known as the Great\nUnconformity.

The\nsequence begins with the folded metamorphic gneiss on\nthe bottom. Next, the gneiss is cut and displaced by the\nfault labeled A. Both the gneiss and fault A are cut by the\nigneous granitic intrusion called batholith B; its irregular\noutline suggests it is an igneous granitic intrusion\nemplaced as magma into the gneiss.

This unconformity was actually an ancient landscape surface on which sedimentary rock\nC was subsequently deposited perhaps by a marine transgression. Next, igneous basaltic dike D cut through all rocks\nexcept sedimentary rock E. This shows that there is a disconformity between sedimentary rocks C and E. The top of dike\nD is level with the top of layer C, which establishes that erosion flattened the landscape prior to the deposition of layer E,\ncreating a disconformity between rocks D and E. Fault F cuts across all of the older rocks B, C and E, producing a fault\nscarp, which is the low ridge on the upper-left side of the diagram. The final events affecting this area are current erosion\nprocesses working on the land surface, rounding off the edge of the fault scarp, and producing the modern landscape at\nthe top of the diagram.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 7.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Based on Hutton\u2019s principle of unifor-\nmitarianism (see chapter 1), early geologists surmised geological\nprocesses work slowly and the Earth is very old. Relative dating\nprinciples was how scientists interpreted Earth history until the end\nof the 19th Century. Because science advances as technology\nadvances, the discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s provided\nscientists with a new scientific tool called radioisotopic dating. Using\nthis new technology, they could assign specific time units, in this\ncase years, to mineral grains within a rock. These numerical values\nare not dependent on comparisons with other rocks such as with rel-\native dating, so this dating method is called absolute dating. There\nFigure 7.16: Canada\u2019s Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt may\nhave the oldest rocks and oldest evidence life on Earth, are several types of absolute dating discussed in this section but\naccording to recent studies. radioisotopic dating is the most common and therefore is the focus\non this section. 196 | GEOLOGIC TIME\n7.2.1 Radioactive Decay\nAll elements on the Periodic Table of Elements (see chap-\nter 3) contain isotopes. An isotope is an atom of an ele-\nment with a different number of neutrons. For example,\nhydrogen (H) always has 1 proton in its nucleus (the atomic\nnumber), but the number of neutrons can vary among the\nisotopes (0, 1, 2). Recall that the number of neutrons added\nto the atomic number gives the atomic mass. When hydro-\ngen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons it is sometimes called pro-\ntium (1H), when hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron it is\ncalled deuterium (2H), and when hydrogen has 1 proton\nand 2 neutrons it is called tritium (3H).\nFigure 7.17: Three isotopes of hydrogen.\nMany elements have both stable and unstable isotopes.\nFor the hydrogen example, 1H and 2H are stable, but 3H is unstable. Unstable isotopes, called radioactive isotopes, spon-\ntaneously decay over time releasing subatomic particles or energy in a process called radioactive decay. When this\noccurs, an unstable isotope becomes a more stable isotope of another element. For example, carbon-14 (14C) decays to\nnitrogen-14 (14N).\nFigure 7.18: Simulation of half-life. On each left column, simulations with only a few atoms. On the right, simulations with many atoms.\nThe radioactive decay of any individual atom is a completely unpredictable and random event. However, some rock spec-\nimens have an enormous number of radioactive isotopes, perhaps trillions of atoms, and this large group of radioactive\nisotopes does have a predictable pattern of radioactive decay. The radioactive decay of half of the radioactive isotopes\nin this group takes a specific amount of time. The time it takes for half of the atoms in a substance to decay is called the\nhalf-life. In other words, the half-life of an isotope is the amount of time it takes for half of a group of unstable isotopes to\ndecay to a stable isotope. The half-life is constant and measurable for a given radioactive isotope, so it can be used to\ncalculate the age of a rock. For example, the half-life uranium-238 (238U) is 4.5 billion years and the half-life of 14C is 5,730\nyears.\nThe principles behind this dating method require two key assumptions. First, the mineral grains containing the isotope\nformed at the same time as the rock, such as minerals in an igneous rock that crystallized from magma. Second, the min-\neral crystals remain a closed system, meaning they are not subsequently altered by elements moving in or out of them. GEOLOGIC TIME | 197\nThese requirements place some constraints on the kinds of\nrock suitable for dating, with igneous rock being the best.\nMetamorphic rocks are crystalline, but the processes of\nmetamorphism may reset the clock and derived ages may\nrepresent a smear of different metamorphic events rather\nthan the age of original crystallization. Detrital sedimen-\ntary rocks contain clasts from separate parent rocks from\nunknown locations and derived ages are thus meaningless.\nHowever, sedimentary rocks with precipitated minerals,\nsuch as evaporites, may contain elements suitable for\nFigure 7.19: Granite (left) and gneiss (right). Dating a mineral within the\nradioisotopic dating. Igneous pyroclastic layers and granite would give the crystallization age of the rock, while dating the\ngneiss might reflect the timing of metamorphism.\nlava flows within a sedimentary sequence can be used to\ndate the sequence. Cross-cutting igneous rocks and sills\ncan be used to bracket the ages of affected, older sedimentary rocks. The resistant mineral zircon, found as clasts in many\nancient sedimentary rocks, has been successfully used for establishing very old dates, including the age of Earth\u2019s oldest\nknown rocks. Knowing that zircon minerals in metamorphosed sediments came from older rocks that are no longer avail-\nable for study, scientists can date zircon to establish the age of the pre-metamorphic source rocks.\nThere are several ways radioactive atoms decay. We will consider three of them\nhere\u2014alpha decay, beta decay, and electron capture. Alpha decay is when an alpha\nparticle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons, is emitted from the nucleus of\nan atom. This also happens to be the nucleus of a helium atom; helium gas may get\ntrapped in the crystal lattice of a mineral in which alpha decay has taken place. When\nan atom loses two protons from its nucleus, lowering its atomic number, it is transformed\ninto an element that is two atomic numbers lower on the Periodic Table of the Elements.\nFigure 7.20: An alpha decay: Two\nprotons and two neutrons leave the\nnucleus.\nFigure 7.21: Periodic table of the elements.\nThe loss of four particles, in this case two neutrons and two protons, also lowers the mass of the atom by four. For example\nalpha decay takes place in the unstable isotope 238U, which has an atomic number of 92 (92 protons) and mass number of\n238 (total of all protons and neutrons). When 238U spontaneously emits an alpha particle, it becomes thorium-234 (234Th).\nThe radioactive decay product of an element is called its daughter isotope and the original element is called the parent\nisotope. In this case, 238U is the parent isotope and 234Th is the daughter isotope. The half-life of 238U is 4.5 billion years, 198 | GEOLOGIC TIME\ni.e., the time it takes for half of the parent isotope atoms to decay into the daughter isotope. This isotope of uranium, 238U,\ncan be used for absolute dating the oldest materials found on Earth, and even meteorites and materials from the earliest\nevents in our solar system.\nBeta Decay\nBeta decay is when a neutron in its nucleus splits into an electron and a\nproton. The electron is emitted from the nucleus as a beta ray. The new\nproton increases the element\u2019s atomic number by one, forming a new\nelement with the same atomic mass as the parent isotope. For example,\n234Th is unstable and undergoes beta decay to form protactinium-234\n(234Pa), which also undergoes beta decay to form uranium-234 (234U).\nNotice these are all isotopes of different elements but they have the\nsame atomic mass of 234. The decay process of radioactive elements\nlike uranium keeps producing radioactive parents and daughters until a\nstable, or non-radioactive, daughter is formed. Such a series is called a\ndecay chain. The decay chain of the radioactive parent isotope 238U\nprogresses through a series of alpha (red arrows on the adjacent figure)\nand beta decays (blue arrows), until it forms the stable daughter isotope,\nlead-206 (206Pb).\nElectron capture is when a proton in the\nnucleus captures an electron from one of\nthe electron shells and becomes a neu-\ntron. This produces one of two different\neffects: 1) an electron jumps in to fill the\nmissing spot of the departed electron and Figure 7.22: Decay chain of U-238 to stable Pb-206\nthrough a series of alpha and beta decays.\nemits an X-ray, or 2) in what is called the\nAuger process, another electron is\nreleased and changes the atom into an ion. The atomic number is reduced by one and mass\nnumber remains the same. An example of an element that decays by electron capture is\npotassium-40 (40K). Radioactive 40K makes up a tiny percentage (0.012%) of naturally occur-\nFigure 7.23: The two paths of\nelectron capture. ring potassium, most of which not radioactive. 40K decays to argon-40 (40Ar) with a half-life\nof 1.25 billion years, so it is very useful for dating geological events.

GEOLOGIC TIME | 199\n7.2.2 Radioisotopic Dating\nFor a given a sample of rock, how is the dating procedure carried out?\nThe parent and daughter isotopes are separated out of the mineral\nusing chemical extraction. In the case of uranium, 238U and 235U iso-\ntopes are separated out together, as are the 206Pb and 207Pb with an\ninstrument called a mass spectrometer.\nHere is a simple example of age calcu-\nlation using the daughter-to-parent ratio\nof isotopes. When the mineral initially\nforms, it consists of 0% daughter and\n100% parent isotope, so the daughter-\nto-parent ratio (D/P) is 0. After one half-\nFigure 7.24: Mass spectrometer instrument.\nlife, half the parent has decayed so\nthere is 50% daughter and 50% parent, a 50/50 ratio, with D/P = 1. After two half-lives, there\nis 75% daughter and 25% parent (75/25 ratio) and D/P = 3. This can be further calculated for\nFigure 7.25: Graph of the amount a series of half-lives as shown in the table. The table does not show more than 10 half-lives\nof half life versus the amount of\nbecause after about 10 half-lives, the amount of remaining parent is so small it becomes\ndaughter isotope.\ntoo difficult to accurately measure via chemical analysis. Modern applications of this\nmethod have achieved remarkable accuracies of plus or minus two million years in 2.5 billion years (that\u2019s \u00b10.055%). Apply-\ning the uranium/lead technique in any given sample analysis provides two separate clocks running at the same time, 238U\nand 235U. The existence of these two clocks in the same sample gives a cross-check between the two. Many geological\nsamples contain multiple parent/daughter pairs, so cross-checking the clocks confirms that radioisotopic dating is highly\nreliable.\nHalf lives (#) Parent present (%) Daughter present (%) Daughter/parent ratio Parent/daughter ratio\nStart the clock 100 0 0 Infinite\n1 50 50 1 1\n2 25 75 3 0.33\n3 12.5 87.5 7 0.143\n4 6.25 93.75 15 0.0667\n5 3.125 96.875 31 0.0325\n10 0.098 99.9 1023 0.00098\nTable 7.2: Ratio of parent to daughter in terms of half-life.\nAnother radioisotopic dating method involves carbon and\nis useful for dating archaeologically important samples\ncontaining organic substances like wood or bone. Radio-\ncarbon dating, also called carbon dating, uses the unstable\nisotope carbon-14 (14C) and the stable isotope carbon-12\n(12C). Carbon-14 is constantly being created in the atmos-\nphere by the interaction of cosmic particles with atmos-\npheric nitrogen-14 (14N). Cosmic particles such as neutrons Figure 7.26: Schematic of carbon going through a mass spectrometer.\nstrike the nitrogen nucleus, kicking out a proton but leav-\ning the neutron in the nucleus. The collision reduces the atomic number by one, changing it from seven to six, changing\nthe nitrogen into carbon with the same mass number of 14. The 14C quickly bonds with oxygen (O) in the atmosphere to\nform carbon dioxide (14CO2) that mixes with other atmospheric carbon dioxide (12CO2) and this mix of gases is incorporated 200 | GEOLOGIC TIME\ninto living matter. While an organism is alive, the ratio of 14C/12C in its body doesn\u2019t really change since CO2 is constantly\nexchanged with the atmosphere. However, when it dies, the radiocarbon clock starts ticking as the 14C decays back to 14N\nby beta decay, which has a half-life of 5,730 years. The radiocarbon dating technique is thus useful for 57,300 years or so,\nabout 10 half-lives back.\nRadiocarbon dating relies on daughter-to-parent ratios derived\nfrom a known quantity of parent 14C. Early applications of carbon\ndating assumed the production and concentration of 14C in the\natmosphere remained fairly constant for the last 50,000 years.\nHowever, it is now known that the amount of parent 14C levels in\nthe atmosphere has varied. Comparisons of carbon ages with\ntree-ring data and other data for known events have allowed reli-\nable calibration of the radiocarbon dating method. Taking into\naccount carbon-14 baseline levels must be calibrated against\nother reliable dating methods, carbon dating has been shown to\nbe a reliable method for dating archaeological specimens and\nvery recent geologic events.\nFigure 7.27: Carbon dioxide concentrations over the last 400,000\n7.2.3 Age of the Earth years.\nThe work of Hutton and other scientists gained attention after\nthe Renaissance (see chapter 1), spurring exploration into the\nidea of an ancient Earth. In the late 19th century William Thomp-\nson, a.k.a. Lord Kelvin, applied his knowledge of physics to\ndevelop the assumption that the Earth started as a hot molten\nsphere. He estimated the Earth is 98 million years old, but\nbecause of uncertainties in his calculations stated the age as a\nrange of between 20 and 400 million years. This animation illus-\ntrates how Kelvin calculated this range and why his numbers\nwere so far off, which has to do with unequal heat transfer within\nFigure 7.28: Artist\u2019s impression of the Earth in the Hadean. the Earth. It has also been pointed out that Kelvin failed to con-\nsider pliability and convection in the Earth\u2019s mantle as a heat\ntransfer mechanism. Kelvin\u2019s estimate for Earth\u2019s age was considered plausible but not without challenge, and the discov-\nery of radioactivity provided a more accurate method for determining ancient ages.\nIn the 1950\u2019s, Clair Patterson (1922\u20131995) thought he could determine the age of the Earth using radioactive isotopes from\nmeteorites, which he considered to be early solar system remnants that were present at the time Earth was forming. Pat-\nterson analyzed meteorite samples for uranium and lead using a mass spectrometer. He used the uranium/lead dating\ntechnique in determining the age of the Earth to be 4.55 billion years, give or take about 70 million (\u00b1 1.5%). The current\nestimate for the age of the Earth is 4.54 billion years, give or take 50 million (\u00b1 1.1%). It is remarkable that Patterson, who was\nstill a graduate student at the University of Chicago, came up with a result that has been little altered in over 60 years, even\nas technology has improved dating methods. GEOLOGIC TIME | 201\n7.2.4 Dating Geological Events\nRadioactive isotopes of elements that are common in mineral crystals are useful for\nradioisotopic dating. The uranium/lead method, with its two cross-checking clocks, is\nmost often used with crystals of the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4) where uranium can substi-\ntute for zirconium in the crystal lattice. Zircon is resistant to weathering which makes it\nuseful for dating geological events in ancient rocks. During metamorphic events, zircon\ncrystals may form multiple crystal layers, with each layer recording the isotopic age of\nan event, thus tracing the progress of the several metamorphic events.\nGeologists have used zircon grains to do some amazing studies that illustrate how sci-\nentific conclusions can change with technological advancements. Zircon crystals from\nWestern Australia that formed when the crust first differentiated from the mantle 4.4 bil-\nlion years ago have been determined to be the oldest known rocks. The zircon grains\nwere incorporated into metasedimentary host rocks, sedimentary rocks showing signs\nof having undergone partial metamorphism. The host rocks were not very old but the\nembedded zircon grains were created 4.4 billion years ago, and survived the subse-\nquent processes of weathering, erosion, deposition, and metamorphism. From other Figure 7.29: Photomicrograph of\nzircon crystal.\nproperties of the zircon crystals, researchers concluded that not only were continental\nrocks exposed above sea level, but also that conditions on the early Earth were cool\nenough for liquid water to exist on the surface. The presence of liquid water allowed the processes of weathering and ero-\nsion to take place. Researchers at UCLA studied 4.1 billion-year-old zircon crystals and found carbon in the zircon crystals\nthat may be biogenic in origin, meaning that life may have existed on Earth much earlier than previously thought.\nIgneous rocks best suited for radioisotopic dating because their pri-\nmary minerals provide dates of crystallization from magma.\nMetamorphic processes tend to reset the clocks and smear the\nigneous rock\u2019s original date. Detrital sedimentary rocks are less\nuseful because they are made of minerals derived from multiple\nparent sources with potentially many dates. However, scientists can\nuse igneous events to date sedimentary sequences. For example,\nif sedimentary strata are between a lava flow and volcanic ash\nbed with radioisotopic dates of 54 million years and 50 million years,\nthen geologists know the sedimentary strata and its fossils formed\nbetween 54 and 50 million years ago. Another example would be a\nFigure 7.30: Several prominent ash beds found in North\nAmerica, including three Yellowstone eruptions shaded pink 65 million year old volcanic dike that cut across sedimentary\n(Mesa Falls, Huckleberry Ridge, and Lava Creek), the Bisho strata.

Potassium is\n1980 ash fall (yellow).\ncommon in evaporite sediments and has been used for potas-\nsium/argon dating. Primary sedimentary minerals containing radioactive isotopes like 40K, has provided dates for impor-\ntant geologic events. 202 | GEOLOGIC TIME\n7.2.5 Other Absolute Dating Techniques\nLuminescence (aka Thermoluminescence): Radioisotopic\ndating is not the only way scientists determine numeric\nages. Luminescence dating measures the time elapsed\nsince some silicate minerals, such as coarse-sediments of\nsilicate minerals, were last exposed to light or heat at the\nsurface of Earth. All buried sediments are exposed to radi-\nation from normal background radiation from the decay\nprocess described above. Some of these electrons get\ntrapped in the crystal lattice of silicate minerals like quartz.\nWhen exposed at the surface, ultraviolet radiation and heat\nfrom the Sun releases these electrons, but when the min-\nerals are buried just a few inches below the surface, the\nelectrons get trapped again. Samples of coarse sediments\ncollected just a few feet below the surface are analyzed by\nstimulating them with light in a lab. This stimulation releases\nthe trapped electrons as a photon of light which is called\nFigure 7.31: Thermoluminescence, a type of luminescence dating. luminescence. The amount luminescence released indi-\ncates how long the sediment has been buried. Lumines-\ncence dating is only useful for dating young sediments that are less than 1 million years old. In Utah, luminescence dating\nis used to determine when coarse-grained sediment layers were buried near a fault. This is one technique used to deter-\nmine the recurrence interval of large earthquakes on faults like the Wasatch Fault that primarily cut coarse-grained mate-\nrial and lack buried organic soils for radiocarbon dating.\nFission Track: Fission track dating relies on damage to the crystal lattice produced when\nunstable 238U decays to the daughter product 234Th and releases an alpha particle.\nThese two decay products move in opposite directions from each other through the crys-\ntal lattice leaving a visible track of damage. This is common in uranium-bearing mineral\ngrains such as apatite. The tracks are large and can be visually counted under an optical\nmicroscope. The number of tracks correspond to the age of the grains. Fission track dat-\ning works from about 100,000 to 2 billion (1 \u00d7 105 to 2 \u00d7 109) years ago. Fission track dating\nhas also been used as a second clock to confirm dates obtained by other methods.\nFigure 7.32: Apatite from Mexico.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 7.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

They may be actual remains of\nbody parts (rare), impressions of soft body parts, casts and molds of body parts (more\ncommon), body parts replaced by mineral (common) or evidence of animal behavior\nsuch as footprints and burrows. The body parts of living organisms range from the hard\nbones and shells of animals, soft cellulose of plants, soft bodies of jellyfish, down to\nsingle cells of bacteria and algae. Which body parts can be preserved? The vast major-\nity of life today consists soft-bodied and/or single celled organisms, and will not likely\nbe preserved in the geologic record except under unusual conditions. The best envi-\nronment for preservation is the ocean, yet marine processes can dissolve hard parts\nand scavenging can reduce or eliminate remains. Thus, even under ideal conditions in\nthe ocean, the likelihood of preservation is quite limited. For terrestrial life, the possibil-\nity of remains being buried and preserved is even more limited. In other words, the fos-\nsil record is incomplete and records only a small percentage of life that existed.\nAlthough incomplete, fossil records are used for stratigraphic correlation, using the\nFigure 7.33: Archaeopteryx Principle of Faunal Succession, and provide a method used for establishing the age of\nlithographica, specimen displayed at a formation on the Geologic Time Scale.\nthe Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde in Berlin.\n7.3.1 Types of Preservation\nRemnants or impressions of hard parts, such as a marine clam shell or dinosaur bone,\nare the most common types of fossils. The original material has almost always been\nreplaced with new minerals that preserve much of the shape of the original shell, bone,\nor cell. The common types of fossil preservation are actual preservation, permineral-\nization, molds and casts, carbonization, and trace fossils.\nActual preservation is a rare form of fossilization where the original materials or hard\nparts of the organism are preserved. Preservation of soft-tissue is very rare since these\norganic materials easily disappear because of bacterial decay. Examples of actual\npreservation are unaltered biological materials like insects in amber or original minerals\nlike mother-of-pearl on the interior of a shell. Another example is mammoth skin and hair\npreserved in post-glacial deposits in the Arctic regions. Rare mummification has left frag-\nments of soft tissue, skin, and sometimes even blood vessels of dinosaurs, from which\nproteins have been isolated and evidence for DNA fragments have been discovered. Figure 7.34: The trilobites had a hard\nexoskeleton, and is an early\narthropod, the same group that\nincludes modern insects,\ncrustaceans, and arachnids.\nFigure 7.35: Mosquito preserved in amber. 204 | GEOLOGIC TIME\nPermineralization occurs when an organism is buried, and then elements in\ngroundwater completely impregnate all spaces within the body, even cells. Soft\nbody structures can be preserved in great detail, but stronger materials like bone\nand teeth are the most likely to be preserved. Petrified wood is an example of\ndetailed cellulose structures in the wood being preserved.

The shape of this cavity is an external\nmold. If the mold is subsequently filled with sediments or a mineral precipitate,\nthe organism\u2019s external shape is preserved as a cast.

This is called authigenic mineralization.\nCarbonization occurs when the organic tis-\nsues of an organism are compressed, the\nvolatiles are driven out, and everything but\nthe carbon disappears leaving a carbon sil-\nhouette of the original organism.

GEOLOGIC TIME | 205\nTrace fossils are indirect evidence left behind by an organism, such as\nburrows and footprints, as it lived its life. Ichnology is specifically the\nstudy of prehistoric animal tracks. Dinosaur tracks testify to their pres-\nence and movement over an area, and even provide information about\ntheir size, gait, speed, and behavior. Burrows dug by tunneling organisms\ntell of their presence and mode of life. Other trace fossils include fos-\nsilized feces called coprolites and stomach stones called gastroliths that\nprovide information about diet and habitat.\n7.3.2 Evolution\nFigure 7.40: Fossil animal droppings (coprolite).\nEvolution has created a variety of ancient fossils that are important to\nstratigraphic correlation. (see chapter 7 and chapter 5) This section is a brief discussion of the process of evolution. The\nBritish naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) recognized that life forms evolve into progeny life forms. He proposed natural\nselection\u2014which operated on organisms living under environmental conditions that posed challenges to survival\u2014was the\nmechanism driving the process of evolution forward.\nThe basic classification unit of life is the species: a population of\norganisms that exhibit shared characteristics and are capable of\nreproducing fertile offspring. For a species to survive, each indi-\nvidual within a particular population is faced with challenges\nposed by the environment and must survive them long enough\nto reproduce. Within the natural variations present in the popula-\ntion, there may be individuals possessing characteristics that\ngive them some advantage in facing the environmental chal-\nlenges. These individuals are more likely to reproduce and pass\nthese favored characteristics on to successive generations. If\nsufficient individuals in a population fail to surmount the chal- Figure 7.41: Variation within a population.\nlenges of the environment and the population cannot produce\nenough viable offspring, the species becomes extinct. The average lifespan of a species in the fossil record is around a\nmillion years. That life still exists on Earth shows the role and importance of evolution as a natural process in meeting the\ncontinual challenges posed by our dynamic Earth. If the inheritance of certain distinctive characteristics is sufficiently\nfavored over time, populations may become genetically isolated from one another, eventually resulting in the evolution of\nseparate species. This genetic isolation may also be caused by a geographic barrier, such as an island surrounded by\nocean. This theory of evolution by natural selection was elaborated by Darwin in his book On the Origin of Species (see\nchapter 1). Since Darwin\u2019s original ideas, technology has provided many tools and mechanisms to study how evolution and\nspeciation take place and this arsenal of tools is growing. Evolution is well beyond the hypothesis stage and is a well-\nestablished theory of modern science.\nVariation within populations occurs by the natural mixing of genes through sexual reproduction or from naturally occurring\nmutations. Some of this genetic variation can introduce advantageous characteristics that increase the individual\u2019s chances\nof survival. While some species in the fossil record show little morphological change over time, others show gradual or\npunctuated changes, within which intermediate forms can be seen. 206 | GEOLOGIC TIME\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 7.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Correlation can be determined by using magnetic\npolarity reversals (chapter 2), rock types, unique rock\nsequences, or index fossils. There are four main types of\ncorrelation: stratigraphic, lithostratigraphic, chronostrati-\ngraphic, and biostratigraphic.\n7.4.1 Stratigraphic Correlation\nStratigraphic correlation is the process of establishing\nwhich sedimentary strata are the same age at distant geo-\ngraphical areas by means of their stratigraphic relation-\nship. Geologists construct geologic histories of areas by\nmapping and making stratigraphic columns-a detailed\ndescription of the strata from bottom to top. An example of Figure 7.42: Image showing fossils that connect the continents of\nGondwana (the southern continents of Pangea).\nstratigraphic relationships and correlation between\nCanyonlands National Park and Zion National Park in Utah.\nAt Canyonlands, the Navajo Sandstone overlies the Kayenta Formation which overlies the cliff-forming Wingate Formation.\nIn Zion, the Navajo Sandstone overlies the Kayenta Formation which overlies the cliff-forming Moenave Formation. Based\non the stratigraphic relationship, the Wingate and Moenave Formations correlate. These two formations have unique\nnames because their composition and outcrop pattern is slightly different. Other strata in the Colorado Plateau and their\nsequence can be recognized and correlated over thousands of square miles. GEOLOGIC TIME | 207\nFigure 7.43: Correlation of strata along the Grand Staircase from the Grand Canyon to Zion Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and Cedar Breaks.\n7.4.2 Lithostratigraphic Correlation\nLithostratigraphic correlation establishes a similar age of strata based on the\nlithology that is the composition and physical properties of that strata. Lithos is\nGreek for stone and -logy comes from the Greek word for doctrine or science.\nLithostratigraphic correlation can be used to correlate whole formations long\ndistances or can be used to correlate smaller strata within formations to trace\ntheir extent and regional depositional environments.\nFor example, the Navajo Sandstone,\nwhich makes up the prominent walls\nof Zion National Park, is the same\nNavajo Sandstone in Canyonlands\nbecause the lithology of the two are\nidentical even though they are hun-\ndreds of miles apart. Extensions of\nFigure 7.44: View of Navajo Sandstone from\nAngel\u2019s Landing in Zion National Park. the same Navajo Sandstone forma-\ntion are found miles away in other\nparts of southern Utah, including Capitol Reef and Arches National Parks. Fur- Figure 7.45: Stevens Arch in the Navajo\nSandstone at Coyote Gulch some 125 miles away\nther, this same formation is the called the Aztec Sandstone in Nevada and\nfrom Zion National Park.\nNugget Sandstone near Salt Lake City because they are lithologically distinct\nenough to warrant new names. 208 | GEOLOGIC TIME\n7.4.3 Chronostratigraphic Correlation\nFigure 7.46: Cross-section of the Permian El Capitan Reef at Guadalupe National Monument, Texas. The red line shows a\nchronostratigraphic time line that represents a snapshot in time in which the shallow marine lagoon/back reef area (light blue), main\nCapitan reef (dark blue), and deep marine silstones (yellow) were all being deposited at the same time.\nChronostratigraphic correlation matches rocks of the same age,\neven though they are made of different lithologies. Different litholo-\ngies of sedimentary rocks can form at the same time at different geo-\ngraphic locations because depositional environments vary\ngeographically. For example, at any one time in a marine setting\nthere could be this sequence of depositional environments from\nbeach to deep marine: beach, near shore area, shallow marine\nlagoon, reef, slope, and deep marine. Each depositional environ-\nment will have a unique sedimentary rock formation. On the figure\nof the Permian Capitan Reef at Guadalupe National Monument in\nWest Texas, the red line shows a chronostratigraphic time line that\nrepresents a snapshot in time. Shallow-water marine lagoon/back Figure 7.47: The rising sea levels of transgressions create\nreef area is light blue, the main Capitan reef is dark blue, and deep- onlapping sediments, regressions create offlapping.

At the same time sandstone (buff color),\nwere forming at the same time in Permian along this red timeline. limestone (gray), and shale (mustard color) are all forming at\ndifferent depths of water. GEOLOGIC TIME | 209\n7.4.4 Biostratigraphic Correlation\nBiostratigraphic correlation uses index fossils to deter-\nmine strata ages. Index fossils represent assemblages or\ngroups of organisms that were uniquely present during\nspecific intervals of geologic time. Assemblages is referring\na group of fossils. Fossils allow geologists to assign a for-\nmation to an absolute date range, such as the Jurassic\nPeriod (199 to 145 million years ago), rather than a relative\ntime scale. In fact, most of the geologic time ranges are\nmapped to fossil assemblages. The most useful index fos-\nsils come from lifeforms that were geographically wide-\nspread and had a species lifespan that was limited to a\nnarrow time interval. In other words, index fossils can be\nfound in many places around the world, but only during a\nnarrow time frame. Some of the best fossils for biostrati-\ngraphic correlation are microfossils, most of which came\nfrom single-celled organisms.\nAs with microscopic organisms today, they were widely\ndistributed across many environments throughout the\nworld. Some of these microscopic organisms had hard\nparts, such as exoskeletons or outer shells, making them\nbetter candidates for preservation.\nFigure 7.48: Index fossils used for biostratigraphic correlation.\nFigure 7.49: Foraminifera, microscopic\ncreatures with hard shells.\nForaminifera, single celled organisms with calcareous shells, are an example of an especially useful index fossil for the\nCretaceous Period and Cenozoic Era. 210 | GEOLOGIC TIME\nConodonts are another example of microfossils useful for biostrati-\ngraphic correlation of the Cambrian through Triassic Periods. Con-\nodonts are tooth-like phosphatic structures of an eel-like multi-\ncelled organism that had no other preservable hard parts. The\nconodont-bearing creatures lived in shallow marine environments\nall over the world. Upon death, the phosphatic hard parts were scat-\ntered into the rest of the marine sediments. These distinctive tooth-\nlike structures are easily collected and separated from limestone in\nthe laboratory.\nBecause the conodont crea-\ntures were so widely abundant,\nrapidly evolving, and readily\npreserved in sediments, their\nfossils are especially useful for\ncorrelating strata, even though\nknowledge of the actual ani-\nmal possessing them is sparse.\nScientists in the 1960s carried\nFigure 7.51: Artist reconstruction of the\nconodont animal. out a fundamental biostrati-\ngraphic correlation that tied\nFigure 7.50: Conodonts.\nTriassic conodont zonation into ammonoids, which are extinct\nancient cousins of the pearly nautilus. Up to that point ammonoids were the only standard for Triassic correlation, so\ncross-referencing micro- and macro-index fossils enhanced the reliability of biostratigraphic correlation for either type.\nThat conodont study went on to establish the use of conodonts to internationally correlate Triassic strata located in\nEurope, Western North America, and the Arctic Islands of Canada. GEOLOGIC TIME | 211\n7.4.5 Geologic Time Scale\nFigure 7.52: Geologic time on Earth, represented circularly, to show the individual time divisions and\nimportant events. Ga=billion years ago, Ma=million years ago.\nGeologic time has been subdivided into a series of divisions by geologists. Eon is the largest division of time, followed by\nera, period, epoch, and age. The partitions of the geologic time scale is the same everywhere on Earth; however, rocks\nmay or may not be present at a given location depending on the geologic activity going on during a particular period of\ntime. Thus, we have the concept of time vs. rock, in which time is an unbroken continuum but rocks may be missing and/or\nunavailable for study. The figure of the geologic time scale, represents time flowing continuously from the beginning of the\nEarth, with the time units presented in an unbroken sequence. But that does not mean there are rocks available for study\nfor all of these time units. 212 | GEOLOGIC TIME\nFigure 7.53: Geologic time scale with ages shown.

The geologic time scale was\ncompletely worked out in the 19th Century using these principles without knowing any actual numeric ages for the events.\nThe discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s enabled absolute dating, the assignment of numerical ages to events in\nthe Earth\u2019s history, using decay of unstable radioactive isotopes. Accurately interpreting radioisotopic dating data depends\non the type of rock tested and accurate assumptions about isotope baseline values. With a combination of relative and\nabsolute dating, the history of geological events, age of Earth, and a geologic time scale have been determined with con-\nsiderable accuracy. Stratigraphic correlation is additional tool used for understanding how depositional environments\nchange geographically. Geologic time is vast, providing plenty of time for the evolution of various lifeforms, and some of\nthese have become preserved as fossils that can be used for biostratigraphic correlation. The geologic time scale is\ncontinuous, although the rock record may be broken because rocks representing certain time periods may be missing.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 7 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Throughout the long\nhistory of Earth, change has been the norm. Looking back\nin time, an untrained eye would see many unfamiliar life\nforms and terrains. The main topics studied in Earth history\nare paleogeography, paleontology, and paleoecology and\npaleoclimatology\u2014respectively, past landscapes, past\norganisms, past ecosystems, and past environments. This\nchapter will cover briefly the origin of the universe and the\n4.6 billion year history of Earth. This Earth history will focus\non the major physical and biological events in each Eons\nand Era.\nFigure 8.1: Geologic time on Earth, represented circularly, to show the\nindividual time divisions and important events. Ga=billion years ago,\nMa=million years ago. 220 | EARTH HISTORY\n8.1 Hadean Eon\nGeoscientists use the geological time scale to assign relative age names to events\nand rocks, separating major events in Earth\u2019s history based on significant changes as\nrecorded in rocks and fossils. This section summarizes the most notable events of\neach major time interval. For a breakdown on how these time intervals are chosen\nand organized, see chapter 7.\nThe Hadean Eon, named after the Greek god and ruler of the underworld Hades, is\nthe oldest eon and dates from 4.5\u20134.0 billion years ago.\nThis time represents Earth\u2019s earliest history, during which the planet was character-\nized by a partially molten surface, volcanism, and asteroid impacts. Several mecha-\nnisms made the newly forming Earth incredibly hot: gravitational compression,\nradioactive decay, and asteroid impacts. Most of this initial heat still exists inside the\nEarth. The Hadean was originally defined as the birth of the planet occurring 4.0 bil-\nlion years ago and preceding the existence of many rocks and life forms. However,\ngeologists have dated minerals at 4.4 billion years, with evidence that liquid water\nwas present. There is possibly even evidence of life existing over 4.0 billion years ago.\nHowever, the most reliable record for early life, the microfossil record, starts at 3.5 bil-\nlion years ago.\nFigure 8.2: Geological time scale with\nages shown.\nFigure 8.3: Artist\u2019s impression of the Earth in the Hadean. EARTH HISTORY | 221\n8.1.1 Origin of Earth\u2019s Crust\nAs Earth cooled from its molten state, minerals started to\ncrystallize and settle resulting in a separation of minerals\nbased on density and the creation of the crust, mantle,\nand core. The earliest Earth was chiefly molten material\nand would have been rounded by gravitational forces so it\nresembled a ball of lava floating in space. As the outer part\nof the Earth slowly cooled, the high melting-point minerals\n(see Bowen\u2019s Reaction Series in chapter 4) formed solid\nslabs of early crust. These slabs were probably unstable\nand easily reabsorbed into the liquid magma until the Earth\ncooled enough to allow numerous larger fragments to\nFigure 8.4: The global map of the depth of the moho. form a thin primitive crust. Scientists generally assume this\ncrust was oceanic and mafic in composition, and littered\nwith impacts, much like the Moon\u2019s current crust. There is still some debate over when plate tectonics started, which\nwould have led to the formation of continental and felsic crust. Regardless of this, as Earth cooled and solidified, less\ndense felsic minerals floated to the surface of the Earth to form the crust, while the denser mafic and ultramafic materi-\nals sank to form the mantle and the highest-density iron and nickel sank into the core. This differentiated the Earth from a\nhomogenous planet into a heterogeneous one with layers of felsic crust, mafic crust, ultramafic mantle, and iron and\nnickel core.\n8.1.2 Origin of the Moon\nSeveral unique features of Earth\u2019s Moon have prompted scientists to develop the cur-\nrent hypothesis about its formation. The Earth and Moon are tidally locked, meaning\nthat as the Moon orbits, one side always faces the Earth and the opposite side is not\nvisible to us. Also and most importantly, the chemical compositions of the Earth and\nMoon show nearly identical isotope ratios and volatile content. Apollo missions\nreturned from the Moon with rocks that allowed scientists to conduct very precise\ncomparisons between Moon and Earth rocks. Other bodies in the solar system and\nmeteorites do not share the same degree of similarity and show much higher vari-\nability. If the Moon and Earth formed together, this would explain why they are so\nchemically similar.\nMany ideas have been proposed\nFigure 8.5: Dark side of the Moon.\nfor the origin of the Moon: The\nMoon could have been captured\nfrom another part of the solar system and formed in place together\nwith the Earth, or the Moon could have been ripped out of the early\nEarth. None of proposed explanations can account for all the evidence.\nThe currently prevailing hypothesis is the giant-impact hypothesis. It\nproposes a body about half of Earth\u2019s size must have shared at least\nparts of Earth\u2019s orbit and collided with it, resulting in a violent mixing and\nscattering of material from both objects. Both bodies would be com-\nposed of a combination of materials, with more of the lower density\nsplatter coalescing into the Moon. This may explain why the Earth has a\nhigher density and thicker core than the Moon. Figure 8.6: Artist\u2019s concept of the giant impact from a\nMars-sized object that could have formed the moon. 222 | EARTH HISTORY\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The volcanic outgassing hypothesis for the origin of Earth\u2019s water is that\nit originated from inside the planet, and emerged via tectonic processes as vapor\nassociated with volcanic eruptions. Since all volcanic eruptions contain some water\nvapor, at times more than 1% of the volume, these alone could have created Earth\u2019s\nsurface water. Another likely source of water was from space. Comets are a mixture\nof dust and ice, with some or most of that ice being frozen water. Seemingly dry\nmeteors can contain small but measurable amounts of water, usually trapped in their\nmineral structures. During heavy bombardment periods later in Earth\u2019s history, its\ncooled surface was pummeled by comets and meteorites, which could be why so\nmuch water exists above ground. There isn\u2019t a definitive answer for what process is\nthe source of ocean water. Earth\u2019s water isotopically matches water found in mete-\nFigure 8.7: Water vapor leaves comet\norites much better than that of comets. However, it is hard to know if Earth processes\n67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko.\ncould have changed the water\u2019s isotopic signature over the last 4-plus billion years.\nIt is possible that all three sources contributed to the origin of Earth\u2019s water.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 8.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This eon\nrepresents the beginning of the rock record. Although there\nis current evidence that rocks and minerals existed during\nthe Hadean Eon, the Archean has a much more robust\nrock and fossil record.\n8.2.1 Late Heavy Bombardment\nFigure 8.8: Artist\u2019s impression of the Archean.\nObjects were chaotically flying around at the start of the solar system, build-\ning the planets and moons. There is evidence that after the planets formed,\nabout 4.1\u20133.8 billion years ago, a second large spike of asteroid and comet\nimpacted the Earth and Moon in an event called late heavy bombardment.\nMeteorites and comets in stable or semi-stable orbits became unstable and\nstarted impacting objects throughout the solar system. In addition, this event\nis called the lunar cataclysm because most of the Moons craters are from this\nevent. During late heavy bombardment, the Earth, Moon, and all planets in\nthe solar system were pummeled by material from the asteroid and Kuiper\nbelts. Evidence of this bombardment was found within samples collected\nfrom the Moon.\nFigure 8.9: 2015 image from NASA\u2019s New\nHorizons probe of Pluto. The lack of impacts\nfound on the Tombaugh Regio (the heart-shaped\nplain, lower right) has been inferred as being\nyounger than the Late Heavy Bombardment and\nthe surrounding surface due to its lack of impacts.\nFigure 8.10: Simulation of before, during, and after the late heavy bombardment.\nIt is universally accepted that the solar system experienced extensive asteroid and comet bombardment at its start; how-\never, some other process must have caused the second increase in impacts hundreds of millions of years later. A lead-\ning theory blames gravitational resonance between Jupiter and Saturn for disturbing orbits within the asteroid and Kuiper\nbelts based on a similar process observed in the Eta Corvi star system. 224 | EARTH HISTORY\n8.2.2 Origin of the Continents\nIn order for plate tectonics to work as it does currently, it\nnecessarily must have continents. However, the easiest\nway to create continental material is via assimilation and\ndifferentiation of existing continents (see chapter 4). This\nchicken-and-egg quandary over how continents were\nmade in the first place is not easily answered because of\nthe great age of continental material and how much evi-\ndence has been lost during tectonics and erosion. While\nthe timing and specific processes are still debated, vol-\ncanic action must have brought the first continental mate-\nrial to the Earth\u2019s surface during the Hadean, 4.4 billion\nyears ago. This model does not solve the problem of con-\ntinent formation, since magmatic differentiation seems\nto need thicker crust. Nevertheless, the continents formed\nFigure 8.11: The layers of the Earth. Physical layers include lithosphere by some incremental process during the early history of\nand asthenosphere; chemical layers are crust, mantle, and core.\nEarth. The best idea is that density differences allowed\nlighter felsic materials to float upward and heavier ultramafic materials and metallic iron to sink. These density differences\nled to the layering of the Earth, the layers that are now detected by seismic studies. Early protocontinents accumulated\nfelsic materials as developing plate\u2013tectonic processes brought lighter material from the mantle to the surface.\nThe first solid evidence of modern plate tectonics is found at the end of\nthe Archean, indicating at least some continental lithosphere must have\nbeen in place. This evidence does not necessarily mark the starting point\nof plate tectonics; remnants of earlier tectonic activity could have been\nerased by the rock cycle.\nFigure 8.12: Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath\nanother oceanic plate, forming a trench and an island\narc. Several island arcs might combine and eventually\nevolve into a continent. EARTH HISTORY | 225\nFigure 8.13: Geologic provinces with the Shield (orange) and Platform (pink) comprising the Craton, the stable interior of\ncontinents.\nThe stable interiors of the current continents are called cratons and were mostly formed in the Archean Eon. A craton has\ntwo main parts: the shield, which is crystalline basement rock near the surface, and the platform made of sedimentary\nrocks covering the shield. Most cratons have remained relatively unchanged with most tectonic activity having occurred\naround cratons instead of within them. Whether they were created by plate tectonics or another process, Archean conti-\nnents gave rise to the Proterozoic continents that now dominate our planet.\nThe general guideline as to what constitutes a continent and differentiates\noceanic from continental crust is under some debate. At passive margins, con-\ntinental crust grades into oceanic crust at passive margins, making a distinction\ndifficult. Even island-arc and hot-spot material can seem more closely related to\ncontinental crust than oceanic. Continents usually have a craton in the middle\nwith felsic igneous rocks. There is evidence that submerged masses like\nZealandia, that includes present-day New Zealand, would be considered a con-\ntinent. Continental crust that does not contain a craton is called a continental\nfragment, such as the island of Madagascar off the east coast of Africa.\nFigure 8.14: The continent of Zealandia. 226 | EARTH HISTORY\n8.2.3 First Life on Earth\nLife most likely started during the late Hadean or early\nArchean Eons. The earliest evidence of life are chemical\nsignatures, microscopic filaments, and microbial mats. Car-\nbon found in 4.1 billion year old zircon grains have a chem-\nical signature suggesting an organic origin. Other evidence\nof early life are 3.8\u20134.3 billion-year-old microscopic fila-\nments from a hydrothermal vent deposit in Quebec,\nCanada. While the chemical and microscopic filaments evi-\ndence is not as robust as fossils, there is significant fossil\nevidence for life at 3.5 billion years ago. These first well-\npreserved fossils are photosynthetic microbial mats, called\nFigure 8.15: Fossils of microbial mats from Sweden. stromatolites, found in Australia.\nAlthough the origin of life on Earth is unknown, hypotheses\ninclude a chemical origin in the early atmosphere and\nocean, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and delivery to\nEarth by comets or other objects. One hypothesis is that\nlife arose from the chemical environment of the Earth\u2019s\nearly atmosphere and oceans, which was very different\nthan today. The oxygen-free atmosphere produced a\nreducing environment with abundant methane, carbon\ndioxide, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds. This is what the\natmosphere is like on other bodies in the solar system. In\nthe famous Miller-Urey experiment, researchers simulated\nearly Earth\u2019s atmosphere and lightning within a sealed\nvessel. After igniting sparks within the vessel, they discov-\nered the formation of amino acids, the fundamental build-\ning blocks of proteins. In 1977, when scientists discovered\nan isolated ecosystem around hydrothermal vents on a\ndeep-sea mid-ocean ridge (see chapter 4), it opened the\ndoor for another explanation of the origin of life. The\nhydrothermal vents have a unique ecosystem of critters Figure 8.16: Greenhouse gases were more common in Earth\u2019s early\nwith chemosynthesis as the foundation of the food chain atmosphere.\ninstead of photosynthesis. The ecosystem is deriving its\nenergy from hot chemical-rich waters pouring out of underground towers. This suggests that life could have started on the\ndeep ocean floor and derived energy from the heat from the Earth\u2019s interior via chemosynthesis. Scientists have since\nexpanded the search for life to more unconventional places, like Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Europa.

During this time, most of the central parts of the\ncontinents had formed and plate tectonic processes had started. Photosynthesis by\nmicrobial organisms, such as single-celled cyanobacteria, had been slowly adding oxy-\ngen to the oceans. As cyanobacteria evolved into multicellular organisms, they com-\npletely transformed the oceans and later the atmosphere by adding massive amounts\nof free oxygen gas (O2) and initiated what is called the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE).\nThis drastic environmental change decimated the anaerobic bacteria, which could not\nsurvive in the presence of free oxygen. On the other hand, aerobic organisms could thrive\nin ways they could not earlier.\nAn oxygenated world also changed the chemistry of the planet in significant ways. For\nexample, iron remained in solution in the non-oxygenated environment of the earlier\nArchean Eon. In chemistry, this is known as a reducing environment. Once the environ-\nment was oxygenated, iron combined with free oxygen to form solid precipitates of iron\nFigure 8.17: Diagram showing the\nmain products and reactants in oxide, such as the mineral hematite or magnetite. These precipitates accumulated into\nphotosynthesis. The one product large mineral deposits with red chert known as banded-iron formations, which are\nthat is not shown is sugar, which is\ndated at about 2 billion years.\nthe chemical energy that goes into\nconstructing the plant, and the\nenergy that is stored in the plant The formation of iron oxide min-\nwhich is used later by the plant or by\nerals and red chert (see figure\nanimals that consume the plant.\n8.18) in the oceans lasted a long\ntime and prevented oxygen levels from increasing significantly, since\nprecipitation took the oxygen out of the water and deposited it into\nthe rock strata. As oxygen continued to be produced and mineral\nprecipitation leveled off, dissolved oxygen gas eventually satu-\nrated the oceans and started bubbling out into the atmosphere.\nOxygenation of the atmosphere is the single biggest event that dis-\ntinguishes the Archean and Proterozoic environments. In addition to\nchanging mineral and ocean chemistry, the GOE is also tabbed as\ntriggering Earth\u2019s first glaciation event around 2.1 billion years ago, Figure 8.18: Alternating bands of iron-rich and silica-rich\nmud, formed as oxygen combined with dissolved iron.\nthe Huron Glaciation. Free oxygen reacted with methane in the\natmosphere to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and methane are called greenhouse gases because they trap\nheat within the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, like the insulated glass of a greenhouse. Methane is a more effective insulator than\ncarbon dioxide, so as the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased, the greenhouse effect decreased,\nand the planet cooled. EARTH HISTORY | 229\n8.3.1 Rodinia\nBy the Proterozoic Eon, lithospheric plates had formed and\nwere moving according to plate tectonic forces that were\nsimilar to current times. As the moving plates collided, the\nocean basins closed to form a supercontinent called\nRodinia. The supercontinent formed about 1 billion years\nago and broke up about 750 to 600 million years ago, at the\nend of the Proterozoic. One of the resulting fragments was a\ncontinental mass called Laurentia that would later become\nNorth America. Geologists have reconstructed Rodinia by\nmatching and aligning ancient mountain chains, assembling\nthe pieces like a jigsaw puzzle, and using paleomagnetics to\norient to magnetic north.\nThe disagreements over these complex reconstructions is\nexemplified by geologists proposing at least six different\nmodels for the breakup of Rodinia to create Australia,\nAntarctica, parts of China, the Tarim craton north of the\nHimalaya, Siberia, or the Kalahari craton of eastern Africa. Figure 8.19: One possible reconstruction of Rodinia 1.1 billion years\nThis breakup created lots of shallow-water, biologically ago.\nfavorable environments that fostered the evolutionary break-\nthroughs marking the start of the next eon, the Phanerozoic.\n8.3.2 Life Evolves\nEarly life in the Archean and earlier is poorly documented in the fossil\nrecord. Based on chemical evidence and evolutionary theory, scientists pro-\npose this life would have been single-celled photosynthetic organisms, such\nas the cyanobacteria that created stromatolites. Cyanobacteria produced\nfree oxygen in the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria,\narchaea, and bacteria are prokaryotes\u2014primitive organisms made of single\ncells that lack cell nuclei and other organelles.\nA large evolutionary\nstep occurred during\nthe Proterozoic Eon\nwith the appearance of Figure 8.20: Modern cyanobacteria (as\nstromatolites) in Shark Bay, Australia.\neukaryotes around 2.1\nto 1.6 billion years ago.\nEukaryotic cells are more complex, having nuclei and organelles.

The\neukaryote branch in the tree of life gave rise to fungi, plants, and ani-\nFigure 8.21: Fossil stromatolites in Saratoga Springs, New\nYork. mals.\nAnother important event in Earth\u2019s biological history occurred about 1.2 billion years ago when eukaryotes invented sexual\nreproduction. Sharing genetic material from two reproducing individuals, male and female, greatly increased genetic vari-\nability in their offspring. This genetic mixing accelerated evolutionary change, contributing to more complexity among indi-\nvidual organisms and within ecosystems (see chapter 7). 230 | EARTH HISTORY\nProterozoic land surfaces were barren of plants and animals and geologic processes actively shaped the environment\ndifferently because land surfaces were not protected by leafy and woody vegetation. For example, rain and rivers would\nhave caused erosion at much higher rates on land surfaces devoid of plants. This resulted in thick accumulations of pure\nquartz sandstone from the Proterozoic Eon such as the extensive quartzite formations in the core of the Uinta Mountains\nin Utah.\nFauna during the Ediacaran Period, 635.5 to 541 million years ago are\nknown as the Ediacaran fauna, and offer a first glimpse at the diversity of\necosystems that evolved near the end of the Proterozoic. These soft-bod-\nied organisms were among the first multicellular life forms and probably\nwere similar to jellyfish or worm-like. Ediacaran fauna did not have hard\nparts like shells and were not well preserved in the rock records. However,\nstudies suggest they were widespread in the Earth\u2019s oceans. Scientists still\ndebate how many species were evolutionary dead-ends that became\nextinct and how many were ancestors of modern groupings. The transition\nof soft-bodied Ediacaran life to life forms with hard body parts occurred at\nthe end of the Proterozoic and beginning of the Phanerozoic Eons. This\nFigure 8.22: Dickinsonia, a typical Ediacaran fossil.\nevolutionary explosion of biological diversity made a dramatic difference in\nscientists\u2019 ability to understand the history of life on Earth.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 8.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Phanero-\nzoic organisms had hard body parts like claws, scales, shells, and bones that were more\neasily preserved as fossils. Rocks from the older Precambrian time are less commonly\nfound and rarely include fossils because these organisms had soft body parts. Phanero-\nzoic rocks are younger, more common, and contain the majority of extant fossils. The\nstudy of rocks from this eon yields much greater detail. The Phanerozoic is subdivided\ninto three eras, from oldest to youngest they are Paleozoic (\u201cancient life\u201d), Mesozoic (\u201cmid-\ndle life\u201d), and Cenozoic (\u201crecent life\u201d) and the remaining three chapter headings are on\nthese three important eras.\nLife in the early Paleozoic Era was\ndominated by marine organisms\nFigure 8.23: The trilobites had a\nhard exoskeleton, and is an early but by the middle of the era plants\narthropod, the same group that\nand animals evolved to live and\nincludes modern insects,\ncrustaceans, and arachnids. reproduce on land. Fish evolved\njaws and fins evolved into jointed\nlimbs. The development of lungs allowed animals to emerge from\nthe sea and become the first air-breathing tetrapods (four-legged\nanimals) such as amphibians. From amphibians evolved reptiles\nwith the amniotic egg. From reptiles evolved an early ancestor to\nbirds and mammals and their scales became feathers and fur. Near Figure 8.24: Trilobites, by Heinrich Harder, 1916.\nthe end of the Paleozoic Era, the Carboniferous Period had some\nof the most extensive forests in Earth\u2019s history. Their fossilized remains became the coal that powered the industrial revo-\nlution\n8.4.1 Paleozoic Tectonics and Paleogeography\nDuring the Paleozoic Era, sea-levels rose and fell four times. With each sea-\nlevel rise, the majority of North America was covered by a shallow tropical\nocean. Evidence of these submersions are the abundant marine sedimentary\nrocks such as limestone with fossils corals and ooids. Extensive sea-level\nfalls are documented by widespread unconformities. Today, the midconti-\nnent has extensive marine sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and western\nNorth America has thick layers of marine limestone on block faulted moun-\ntain ranges such as Mt.

The name Pangea was originally coined by\nAlfred Wegener and means \u201call land.\u201d Pangea is the when all of the major conti-\nnents were grouped together as one by a series of tectonic events including sub-\nduction island-arc accretion, and continental collisions, and ocean-basin\nclosures. In North America, these tectonic events occurred on the east coast and\nare known as the Taconic, Acadian, Caledonian, and Alleghanian orogenies. The\nAppalachian Mountains are the erosional remnants of these mountain building\nevents in North America. Surrounding Pangea was a global ocean basin known\nas the Panthalassa. Continued plate movement extended the ocean into Pangea,\nforming a large bay called the Tethys Sea that eventually divided the land mass\ninto two smaller supercontinents, Laurasia and Gondwana. Laurasia consisted of\nLaurentia and Eurasia, and Gondwana consisted of the remaining continents of\nSouth America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica.\nFigure 8.26: A reconstruction of Pangaea,\nshowing approximate positions of modern\ncontinents.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The western edge of North American continent was near the\npresent-day Nevada-Utah border and was an expansive shallow continental shelf near the paleoequator. However, by\nthe Devonian Period, the Antler orogeny started on the west coast and lasted until the Pennsylvanian Period. The Antler\norogeny was a volcanic island arc that was accreted onto western North America with the subduction direction away\nfrom North America. This created a mountain range on the west coast of North American called the Antler highlands and\nwas the first part of building the land in the west that would eventually make most of California, Oregon, and Washington\nstates. By the late Paleozoic, the Sonoma orogeny began on the west coast and was another collision of an island arc.\nThe Sonoma orogeny marks the change in subduction direction to be toward North America with a volcanic arc along\nthe entire west coast of North America by late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic Eras.\nBy the end of the Paleozoic Era, the east coast of North America had a very high mountain range due to continental colli-\nsion and the creation of Pangea. The west coast of North America had smaller and isolated volcanic highlands associated\nwith island arc accretion. During the Mesozoic Era, the size of the mountains on either side of North America would flip,\nwith the west coast being a more tectonically active plate boundary and the east coast changing into a passive margin\nafter the breakup of Pangea. EARTH HISTORY | 233\n8.4.2 Paleozoic Evolution\nThe beginning of the Paleozoic Era is marked by the first appearance of\nhard body parts like shells, spikes, teeth, and scales; and the appearance\nin the rock record of most animal phyla known today. That is, most basic\nanimal body plans appeared in the rock record during the Cambrian\nPeriod. This sudden appearance of biological diversity is called the Cam-\nbrian Explosion. Scientists debate whether this sudden appearance is\nmore from a rapid evolutionary diversification as a result of a warmer cli-\nmate following the late Proterozoic glacial environments, better preser-\nvation and fossilization of hard parts, or artifacts of a more complete and\nrecent rock record. For example, fauna may have been diverse during the\nEdiacaran Period, setting the state for the Cambrian Explosion, but they\nFigure 8.27: Anomalocaris reconstruction by the MUSE\nlacked hard body parts and would have left few fossils behind. Regard- science museum in Italy.\nless, during the Cambrian Period 541\u2013485 million years ago marked the\nappearance of most animal phyla.\nOne of the best fossil sites for the Cambrian Explosion was discovered in 1909 by\nCharles Walcott (1850\u20131927) in the Burgess Shale in western Canada. The Burgess\nShale is a Lagerst\u00e4tte, a site of exceptional fossil preservation that includes impres-\nsions of soft body parts. This discovery allowed scientists to study Cambrian animals in\nimmense detail because soft body parts are not normally preserved and fossilized.\nOther Lagerst\u00e4tte sites of similar age in China and Utah have allowed scientist to form\na detailed picture of Cambrian biodiversity. The biggest mystery surrounds animals that\ndo not fit existing lineages and are unique to that time. This includes many famous fos-\nsilized creatures: the first compound-eyed trilobites; Wiwaxia, a creature covered in\nspiny plates; Hallucigenia, a walking worm with spikes; Opabinia, a five-eyed arthropod\nwith a grappling claw; and Anomalocaris, the alpha predator of its time, complete with\ngrasping appendages and circular mouth with sharp plates. Most notably appearing\nduring the Cambrian is an important ancestor to humans. A segmented worm called\nPikaia is thought to be the earliest ancestor of the Chordata phylum that includes ver-\ntebrates, animals with backbones.\nBy the end of the Cambrian, mol-\nlusks, brachiopods, nautiloids,\ngastropods, graptolites, echino-\nderms, and trilobites covered the\nsea floor. Although most animal\nphyla appeared by the Cambrian,\nthe biodiversity at the family,\ngenus, and species level was low\nuntil the Ordovician Period. Dur-\ning the Great Ordovician Biodiver-\nsification Event, vertebrates and\nFigure 8.28: Original plate from invertebrates (animals without\nWalcott\u2019s 1912 description of Opabinia, Figure 8.29: A modern coral reef.\nbackbone) became more diverse\nwith labels: fp = frontal appendage, e\n= eye, ths = thoracic somites, i = and complex at family, genus, and\nintestine, ab = abdominal segment.\nspecies level. The cause of the rapid speciation event is still debated but some likely\ncauses are a combination of warm temperatures, expansive continental shelves near\nthe equator, and more volcanism along the mid-ocean ridges. Some have shown evidence that an asteroid breakup event 234 | EARTH HISTORY\nand consequent heavy meteorite impacts correlate with this diversification event. The additional volcanism added nutri-\nents to ocean water helping support a robust ecosystem. Many life forms and ecosystems that would be recognizable in\ncurrent times appeared at this time. Mollusks, corals, and arthropods in particular multiplied to dominate the oceans.\nOne important evolutionary advancement during the\nOrdovician Period was reef-building organisms, mostly\ncolonial coral. Corals took advantage of the ocean chem-\nistry, using calcite to build large structures that resembled\nmodern reefs like the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Aus-\ntralia. These reefs housed thriving ecosystems of organisms\nthat swam around, hid in, and crawled over them. Reefs are\nimportant to paleontologists because of their preservation\npotential, massive size, and in-place ecosystems. Few other\nfossils offer more diversity and complexity than reef assem-\nblages.\nAccording to evidence from glacial deposits, a small ice\nFigure 8.30: Guadalupe National Park is made of a giant fossil reef. age caused sea-levels to drop and led to a major mass\nextinction by the end of the Ordovician.

The period\u2019s major evolution-\nary event was the development of jaws from the forward pair of gill arches\nin bony fishes and sharks. Hinged jaws allowed fish to exploit new food\nsources and ecological niches. This period also included the start of\narmored fishes, known as the placoderms. In addition to fish and jaws, Sil-\nurian rocks provide the first evidence of terrestrial or land-dwelling plants\nand animals. The first vascular plant, Cooksonia, had woody tissues, pores\nfor gas exchange, and veins for water and food transport. Insects, spiders,\nscorpions, and crustaceans began to inhabit moist, freshwater terrestrial\nenvironments.\nFigure 8.31: The placoderm Bothriolepis panderi\nfrom the Devonian of Russia. EARTH HISTORY | 235\nThe Devonian Period is called the Age of Fishes due to the\nrise in plated, jawed, and lobe-finned fishes. The lobe-\nfinned fishes, which were related to the modern lungfish\nand coelacanth, are important for their eventual evolution\ninto tetrapods, four-limbed vertebrate animals that can\nwalk on land. The first lobe-finned land-walking fish,\nnamed Tiktaalik, appeared about 385 million years ago and\nserves as a transition fossil between fish and early\ntetrapods. Though Tiktaalik was clearly a fish, it had some\ntetrapod structures as well. Several fossils from the\nDevonian are more tetrapod like than fish like but these\nFigure 8.32: Several different types of fish and amphibians that led to\nwalking on land. weren\u2019t fully terrestrial. The first fully terrestrial tetrapod\narrived in the Mississippian (early Carboniferous) period.\nBy the Mississippian (early Carboniferous) period, tetrapods had evolved into two main groups, amphibians and amniotes,\nfrom a common tetrapod ancestor. The amphibians were able to breathe air and live on land but still needed water to nur-\nture their soft eggs. The first reptile (an amniote) could live and reproduce entirely on land with hard-shelled eggs that\nwouldn\u2019t dry out.\nLand plants had also evolved into the first trees and forests. Toward the end of the Devonian, another mass extinction\nevent occurred. This extinction, while severe, is the least temporally defined, with wide variations in the timing of the event\nor events. Reef building organisms were the hardest hit, leading to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems.\nThe next time period, called the Carboniferous (North\nAmerican geologists have subdivided this into the Mississip-\npian and Pennsylvanian periods), saw the highest levels of\noxygen ever known, with forests (e.g., ferns, club mosses)\nand swamps dominating the landscape. This helped\ncause the largest arthropods ever, like the millipede Arthro-\npleura, at 2.5 meters (6.4 feet) long! It also saw the rise of a\nnew group of animals, the reptiles. The evolutionary advan-\ntage that reptiles have over amphibians is the amniote egg\n(egg with a protective shell), which allows them to rely on\nFigure 8.33: A reconstruction of the giant arthropod (insects and their\nnon-aquatic environments for reproduction. This widened\nrelatives) Arthropleura.\nthe terrestrial reach of reptiles compared to amphibians.\nThis booming life, especially plant life, created cooling temperatures as carbon dioxide was removed from the atmos-\nphere. By the middle Carboniferous, these cooler temperatures led to an ice age (called the Karoo Glaciation) and less-\nproductive forests. The reptiles fared much better than the amphibians, leading to their diversification. This glacial event\nlasted into the early Permian.\nBy the Permian, with Pangea assembled, the supercontinent led to a\ndryer climate, and even more diversification and domination by the\nreptiles. The groups that developed in this warm climate eventually\nradiated into dinosaurs. Another group, known as the synapsids, even-\ntually evolved into mammals. Synapsids, including the famous sail-\nbacked Dimetrodon are commonly confused with\ndinosaurs. Pelycosaurs (of the Pennsylvanian to early Permian like\nDimetrodon) are the first group of synapsids that exhibit the beginnings\nof mammalian characteristics such as well-differentiated dentition:\nFigure 8.34: Reconstruction of Dimetrodon.\nincisors, highly developed canines in lower and upper jaws and cheek\nteeth, premolars and molars. Starting in the late Permian, a second\ngroup of synapsids, called the therapsids (or mammal-like reptiles) evolve, and become the ancestors to mammals. 236 | EARTH HISTORY\nPermian Mass Extinction\nFigure 8.35: World map of flood basalts. Note the largest is the Siberian Traps.\nThe end of the Paleozoic era is marked by the largest mass extinction in earth history. The Paleozoic era had two smaller\nmass extinctions, but these were not as large as the Permian Mass Extinction, also known as the Permian-Triassic\nExtinction Event. It is estimated that up to 96% of marine species and 70% of land-dwelling (terrestrial) vertebrates went\nextinct. Many famous organisms, like sea scorpions and trilobites, were never seen again in the fossil record. What caused\nsuch a widespread extinction event? The exact cause is still debated, though the leading idea relates to extensive vol-\ncanism associated with the Siberian Traps, which are one of the largest deposits of flood basalts known on Earth, dating\nto the time of the extinction event. The eruption size is estimated at over 3 million cubic kilometers that is approximately\n4,000,000 times larger than the famous 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption in Washington. The unusually large volcanic eruption\nwould have contributed a large amount of toxic gases, aerosols, and greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Further,\nsome evidence suggests that the volcanism burned vast coal deposits releasing methane (a greenhouse gas) into the\natmosphere. As discussed in chapter 15, greenhouse gases cause the climate to warm. This extensive addition of green-\nhouse gases from the Siberian Traps may have caused a runaway greenhouse effect that rapidly changed the climate,\nacidified the oceans, disrupted food chains, disrupted carbon cycling, and caused the largest mass extinction.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 8.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The Mesozoic is probably best known as\nthe age of reptiles, most notably, the dinosaurs.\nFigure 8.36: Perhaps the greatest fossil ever found, a velociraptor\nattacked a protoceratops, and both were fossilized mid sequence.\n8.5.1 Mesozoic Tectonics and Paleogeography\nFigure 8.37: Pangea breaking up.\nPangea started breaking up (in a region that would become eastern Canada and United States) around 210 million years\nago in the Late Triassic. Clear evidence for this includes the age of the sediments in the Newark Supergroup rift basins\nand the Palisades sill of the eastern part of North America and the age of the Atlantic ocean floor. Due to sea-floor spread-\ning, the oldest rocks on the Atlantic\u2019s floor are along the coast of northern Africa and the east coast of North America, while\nthe youngest are along the mid-ocean ridge.\nThis age pattern shows how the Atlantic Ocean opened as\nthe young Mid-Atlantic Ridge began to create the seafloor.\nThis means the Atlantic ocean started opening and was\nfirst formed here. The southern Atlantic opened next, with\nSouth America separating from central and southern Africa.\nLast (happening after the Mesozoic ended) was the north-\nernmost Atlantic, with Greenland and Scandinavia parting\nways. The breaking points of each rifted plate margin\neventually turned into the passive plate boundaries of the\neast coast of the Americas today.\nFigure 8.38: Age of oceanic lithosphere, in millions of years.

Another possible island-arc collision created the Sonoman Orogeny in Nevada during the latest\nPaleozoic to the Triassic. In the Jurassic, another island-arc collision caused the Nevadan Orogeny, a large Andean-style\nvolcanic arc and thrust belt. The Sevier Orogeny followed in the Cretaceous, which was mainly a volcanic arc to the west\nand a thin-skinned fold and thrust belt to the east, meaning stacks of shallow faults and folds built up the topography.\nMany of the structures in the Rocky Mountains today date from this orogeny.\nTectonics had an influence in one more important geographic feature in North America:\nthe Cretaceous Western Interior Foreland Basin, which flooded during high sea levels\nforming the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. Subduction from the west was the Farallon\nPlate, an oceanic plate connected to the Pacific Plate (seen today as remnants such as\nthe Juan de Fuca Plate, off the coast of the Pacific Northwest). Subduction was shallow\nat this time because a very young, hot and less dense portion of the Farallon plate was\nsubducted. This shallow subduction caused a downwarping in the central part of North\nAmerica. High sea levels due to shallow subduction, and increasing rates of seafloor\nspreading and subduction, high temperatures, and melted ice also contributed to the\nhigh sea levels. These factors allowed a shallow epicontinental seaway that extended\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean to divide North America into two separate\nland masses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east, for 25 million years. Many\nFigure 8.40: The Cretaceous Interior\nof the coal deposits in Utah and Wyoming formed from swamps along the shores of this\nSeaway in the mid-Cretaceous.\nseaway. By the end of the Cretaceous, cooling temperatures caused the seaway to\nregress. EARTH HISTORY | 239\n8.5.2 Mesozoic Evolution\nThe Mesozoic era is dominated by reptiles, and more specifically,\nthe dinosaurs. The Triassic saw devastated ecosystems that took\nover 30 million years to fully re-emerge after the Permian Mass\nExtinction. The first appearance of many modern groups of animals\nthat would later flourish occurred at this time. This includes frogs\n(amphibians), turtles (reptiles), marine ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs\n(marine reptiles), mammals, and the archosaurs. The archosaurs\n(\u201cruling reptiles\u201d) include ancestral groups that went extinct at the\nend of the Triassic, as well as the flying pterosaurs, crocodilians, and\nthe dinosaurs. Archosaurs, like the placental mammals after them,\noccupied all major environments: terrestrial (dinosaurs), in the air\n(pterosaurs), aquatic (crocodilians) and even fully marine habitats\n(marine crocodiles). The pterosaurs, the first vertebrate group to\nFigure 8.41: A Mesozoic scene from the late Jurassic.\ntake flight, like the dinosaurs and mammals, start small in the Trias-\nsic.\nAt the end of the Triassic, another mass extinction event occurred, the\nfourth major mass extinction in the geologic record. This was perhaps\ncaused by the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province flood basalt. The\nend-Triassic extinction made certain lineages go extinct and helped\nspur the evolution of survivors like mammals, pterosaurs (flying rep-\ntiles), ichthyosaurs/plesiosaurs/mosasaurs (marine reptiles), and\ndinosaurs.\nMammals, as previ-\nously mentioned, got\nFigure 8.42: A drawing of the early plesiosaur\ntheir start from a rep-\nAgustasaurus from the Triassic of Nevada.\ntilian synapsid ances-\ntor possibly in the late Paleozoic. Mammals stayed small, in mainly\nnocturnal niches, with insects being their largest prey. The development\nof warm-blooded circulation and fur may have been a response to this\nlifestyle.\nIn the Jurassic, species that were\nFigure 8.43: Reconstruction of the small (<5\u2033) previously common, flourished due\nMegazostrodon, one of the first animals considered to\nto a warmer and more tropical cli-\nbe a true mammal.\nmate. The dinosaurs were relatively\nsmall animals in the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, but became truly massive in the\nJurassic. Dinosaurs are split into two groups based on their hip structure, i.e. orienta-\ntion of the pubis and ischium bones in relationship to each other. This is referred to as\nthe \u201creptile hipped\u201d saurischians and the \u201cbird hipped\u201d ornithischians. This has recently\nbeen brought into question by a new idea for dinosaur lineage.\nFigure 8.44: Closed structure of a\nornithischian hip, which is similar to a\nbirds. 240 | EARTH HISTORY\nMost of the dinosaurs of the Triassic were saurischians, but all of them were bipedal.\nThe major adaptive advantage dinosaurs had was changes in the hip and ankle bones,\ntucking the legs under the body for improved locomotion as opposed to the semi-\nerect gait of crocodiles or the sprawling posture of reptiles. In the Jurassic, limbs (or a\nlack thereof) were also important to another group of reptiles, leading to the evolution\nof Eophis, the oldest snake.\nThere is a paucity of\ndinosaur fossils from the\nEarly and Middle Jurassic,\nbut by the Late Jurassic\nFigure 8.45: Open structure of a they were dominating the\nsaurischian hip, which is similar to a\nplanet. The saurischians\nlizards.\ndiversified into the giant\nherbivorous (plant-eating) long-necked sauropods weighing up\nto 100 tons and bipedal carnivorous theropods, with the possible\nexception of the Therizinosaurs. All of the ornithischians (e.g Figure 8.46: Therizinosaurs, like Beipiaosaurus (shown in this\nrestoration), are known for their enormous hand claws.\nStegosaurus, Iguanodon, Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, Pachy-\ncephhlosaurus) were herbivorous with a strong tendency to have\na \u201cturtle-like\u201d beak at the tips of their mouths.\nThe pterosaurs grew and diversified in the Jurassic, and another notable arial organism\ndeveloped and thrived in the Jurassic: birds. When Archeopteryx was found in the\nSolnhofen Lagerst\u00e4tte of Germany, a seeming dinosaur-bird hybrid, it started the con-\nversation on the origin of birds. The idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs occurred very\nearly in the history of research into evolution, only a few years after Darwin\u2019s On the Ori-\ngin of Species. This study used a remarkable fossil of Archeopteryx from a transitional\nanimal between dinosaurs and birds. Small meat-eating theropod dinosaurs were likely\nthe branch that became birds due to their similar features. A significant debate still exists\nover how and when powered flight evolved. Some have stated a running-start model,\nwhile others have favored a tree-leaping gliding model or even a semi-combination:\nflapping to aid in climbing.\nThe Cretaceous saw a further diversification, special-\nization, and domination of the dinosaurs and other\nFigure 8.47: Archaeopteryx\nfauna. One of the biggest changes on land was the\nlithographica, specimen displayed at\nthe Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde in Berlin. transition to angiosperm-dominated flora.\nAngiosperms, which are plants with flowers and seeds,\nhad originated in the Cretaceous, switching many plains to grasslands by the end of the\nMesozoic. By the end of the period, they had replaced gymnosperms (evergreen trees)\nand ferns as the dominant plant in the world\u2019s forests. Haplodiploid eusocial insects (bees\nand ants) are descendants from Jurassic wasp-like ancestors that co-evolved with the\nflowering plants during this time period. The breakup of Pangea not only shaped our\nmodern world\u2019s geography, but biodiversity at the time as well. Throughout the Mesozoic,\nanimals on the isolated, now separated island continents (formerly parts of Pangea), took\nstrange evolutionary turns. This includes giant titanosaurian sauropods (Argentinosaurus)\nand theropods (Giganotosaurus) from South America.\nFigure 8.48: Reconstructed\nskeleton of Argentinosaurus, from\nNaturmuseum Senckenberg in\nGermany. EARTH HISTORY | 241\nK-T Extinction\nSimilar to the end of the Paleozoic era, the Mesozoic Era ended\nwith the K-Pg Mass Extinction (previously known as the K-T\nExtinction) 66 million years ago. This extinction event was likely\ncaused by a large bolide (an extraterrestrial impactor such as an\nasteroid, meteoroid, or comet) that collided with earth. Ninety per-\ncent of plankton species, 75% of plant species, and all the dinosaurs\nwent extinct at this time.\nFigure 8.49: Graph of the rate of extinctions. Note the large\nspike at the end of the Cretaceous (labeled as K).\nOne of the strongest pieces of evidence comes from the element irid-\nium. Quite rare on Earth, and more common in meteorites, it has been\nfound all over the world in higher concentrations at a particular layer of\nrock that formed at the time of the K-T boundary. Soon other scientists\nFigure 8.50: Artist\u2019s depiction of an impact event.\nstarted to find evidence to back up the claim. Melted rock spheres, a spe-\ncial type of \u201cshocked\u201d quartz called stishovite, that only is found at impact sites, was found in many places around the\nworld. The huge impact created a strong thermal pulse that could be responsible for global forest fires, strong acid rains, a\ncorresponding abundance of ferns, the first colonizing plants after a forest fire, enough debris thrown into the air to signifi-\ncantly cool temperatures afterward, and a 2-km high tsunami inferred from deposits found from Texas to Alabama.\nStill, with all this evidence, one large piece remained missing: the crater where the\nbolide impacted. It was not until 1991 that the crater was confirmed using petro-\nleum company geophysical data. Even though it is the third largest confirmed\ncrater on Earth at roughly 180 km wide, the Chicxulub Crater was hard to find due\nto being partially underwater and partially obscured by the dense forest canopy\nof the Yucatan Peninsula. Coring of the center of the impact called the peak ring\ncontained granite, indicating the impact was so powerful that it lifted basement\nsediment from the crust several miles toward the surface. In 2010, an international\nteam of scientists reviewed 20 years of research and blamed the impact for the\nextinction.\nFigure 8.51: The land expression of the\nChicxulub crater. The other side of the crater\nis within the Gulf of M\u00e9xico. 242 | EARTH HISTORY\nWith all of this information, it seems like the case would be\nclosed. However, there are other events at this time which\ncould have partially aided the demise of so many organ-\nisms. For example, sea levels are known to be slowly\ndecreasing at the time of the K-T event, which is tied to\nmarine extinctions, though any study on gradual vs. sud-\nden changes in the fossil record is flawed due to the\nincomplete nature of the fossil record. Another big event at\nthis time was the Deccan Traps flood basalt volcanism in\nIndia. At over 1.3 million cubic kilometers of material, it was\ncertainly a large source of material hazardous to ecosys-\ntems at the time, and it has been suggested as at least par-\ntially responsible for the extinction. Some have found the\nimpact and eruptions too much of a coincidence, and have\neven linked the two together.\nFigure 8.52: Geology of India, showing purple as Deccan Traps-related\nrocks.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 8.5 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Birds, as well, flourished in the open niches left\nby the dinosaur\u2019s demise. Most of the Cenozoic has been relatively warm,\nwith the main exception being the ice age that started about 2.558 million\nyears ago and (despite recent warming) continues today. Tectonic shifts in\nthe west caused volcanism, but eventually changed the long-standing sub-\nduction zone into a transform boundary.\nFigure 8.53: Paraceratherium, seen in this\nreconstruction, was a massive (15-20 ton, 15 foot\ntall) ancestor of rhinos.\n8.6.1 Cenozoic Tectonics and Paleogeography\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Note, that\nafter the ridge is subducted, convergent turns to transform (with divergent inland).\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this YouTube video via the QR code.\nIn the Cenozoic, the plates of the Earth moved into more familiar\nplaces, with the biggest change being the closing of the Tethys Sea\nwith collisions such as the Alps, Zagros, and Himalaya, a collision that\nstarted about 57 million years ago, and continues today. Maybe the\nmost significant tectonic feature that occurred in the Cenozoic of\nNorth America was the conversion of the west coast of California from\na convergent boundary subduction zone to a transform boundary.\nSubduction off the coast of the western United States, which had\nFigure 8.54: Shallow subduction during the Laramide\noccurred throughout the Mesozoic, had continued in the Cenozoic.\nOrogeny.\nAfter the Sevier Orogeny in the late Mesozoic, a subsequent orogeny\ncalled the Laramide Orogeny, occurred in the early Cenozoic. The Laramide was thick-skinned, different than the Sevier\nOrogeny. It involved deeper crustal rocks, and produced bulges that would become mountain ranges like the Rockies,\nBlack Hills, Wind River Range, Uinta Mountains, and the San Rafael Swell. Instead of descending directly into the mantle,\nthe subducting plate shallowed out and moved eastward beneath the continental plate affecting the overlying continent\nhundreds of miles east of the continental margin and building high mountains. This occurred because the subducting\nplate was so young and near the spreading center and the density of the plate was therefore low and subduction was\nhindered. 244 | EARTH HISTORY\nAs the mid-ocean ridge itself started to subduct, the relative motion had changed.\nSubduction caused a relative convergence between the subducting Farallon plate\nand the North American plate. On the other side of the mid-ocean ridge from the\nFarallon plate was the Pacific plate, which was moving away from the North Amer-\nican plate. Thus, as the subduction zone consumed the mid-ocean ridge, the rel-\native movement became transform instead of convergent, which went on to\nbecome the San Andreas Fault System. As the San Andreas grew, it caused east-\nwest directed extensional forces to spread over the western United States, creating\nthe Basin and Range province. The transform fault switched position over the last\n18 million years, twisting the mountains around Los Angeles, and new faults in the\nsoutheastern California deserts may become a future San Andreas-style fault. Dur-\ning this switch from subduction to transform, the nearly horizontal Farallon slab\nbegan to sink into the mantle. This caused magmatism as the subducting slab\nsank, allowing asthenosphere material to rise around it. This event is called the\nOligocene ignimbrite flare-up, which was one of the most significant periods of vol-\ncanism ever, including the largest single confirmed eruption, the 5000 cubic kilo-\nFigure 8.55: Map of the San Andreas fault, meter Fish Canyon Tuff.\nshowing relative motion.\n8.6.2 Cenozoic Evolution\nThere are five groups of early mammals in the fossil\nrecord, based primarily on fossil teeth, the hardest bone in\nvertebrate skeletons. For the purpose of this text, the most\nimportant group are the Eupantotheres, that diverge into\nthe two main groups of mammals, the marsupials (like Sin-\nodelphys) and placentals or eutherians (like Eomaia) in the\nCretaceous and then diversified in the Cenozoic. The mar-\nFigure 8.56: Family tree of Hominids (Hominadae). supials dominated on the isolated island continents of\nSouth America and Australia, and many went extinct in\nSouth America with the introduction of placental mammals. Some well-known mammal groups have been highly studied\nwith interesting evolutionary stories in the Cenozoic. For example, horses started small with four toes, ended up larger and\nhaving just one toe. Cetaceans (marine mammals like whales and dolphins) started on land from small bear-like (mesony-\nchids) creatures in the early Cenozoic and gradually took to water. However, no study of evolution has been more studied\nthan human evolution. Hominids, the name for human-like primates, started in eastern Africa several million years ago. EARTH HISTORY | 245\nThe first critical event in this story is an environmental change from jungle to more of a\nsavanna, probably caused by changes in Indian Ocean circulation. While bipedalism is\nknown to have evolved before this shift, it is generally believed that our bipedal ancestors\n(like Australopithecus) had an advantage by covering ground more easily in a more open\nenvironment compared to their non-bipedal evolutionary cousins. There is also a growing\nbody of evidence, including the famous \u201cLucy\u201d fossil of an Australopithecine, that our\nearly ancestors lived in trees. Arboreal animals usually demand a high intelligence to nav-\nigate through a three-dimensional world. It is from this lineage that humans evolved,\nusing endurance running as a means to acquire more resources and possibly even hunt.\nThis can explain many uniquely human features, from our long legs, strong achilles, lack\nof lower gut protection, and our wide range of running efficiencies.\nNow that the hands are freed up, the next big step is a large brain. There have been argu-\nments from a switch to more meat eating, cooking with fire, tool use, and even the con-\nstruct of society itself to explain this increase in brain size. Regardless of how, it was this\nincreased cognitive power that allowed humans to reign as their ancestors moved out of\nFigure 8.57: Lucy skeleton, showing\nAfrica and explored the world, ultimately entering the Americas through land bridges like real fossil (brown) and\nreconstructed skeleton (white).\nthe Bering Land Bridge. The details of this worldwide migration and the different branches\nof the hominid evolutionary tree are very complex, and best reserved for its own course.\nFigure 8.58: The hypothesized movement of the homo genus. Years are marked as to the best guess of the timing of movement. 246 | EARTH HISTORY\nAnthropocene and Extinction\nHumans have had an influence on the Earth, its ecosys-\ntems and climate. Yet, human activity can not explain all of\nthe changes that have occurred in the recent past. The start\nof the Quaternary period, the last and current period of\nthe Cenozoic, is marked by the start of our current ice age\n2.58 million years ago. During this time period, ice sheets\nadvanced and retreated, most likely due to Milankovitch\ncycles (see chapter 15). Also at this time, various cold-\nadapted megafauna emerged (like giant sloths, saber-\ntooth cats, and woolly mammoths), and most of them went\nextinct as the Earth warmed from the most recent glacial\nmaximum. A long-standing debate is over the cause of\nthese and other extinctions. Is climate warming to blame,\nor were they caused by humans? Certainly, we know of\nrecent human extinctions of animals like the dodo or pas-\nsenger pigeon. Can we connect modern extinctions to\nextinctions in the recent past? If so, there are several ideas\nas to how this happened. Possibly the most widely\naccepted and oldest is the hunting/overkill hypothesis.\nThe idea behind this hypothesis is that humans hunted\nFigure 8.59: Graph showing abundance of large mammals and the\nlarge herbivores for food, then carnivores could not find\nintroduction of humans.\nfood, and human arrival times in locations has been shown\nto be tied to increased extinction rates in many cases.\nModern human impact on the environment and the Earth\nas a whole is unquestioned. In fact, many scientists are\nstarting to suggest that the rise of human civilization ended\nand/or replaced the Holocene epoch and defines a new\ngeologic time interval: the Anthropocene. Evidence for this\nchange includes extinctions, increased tritium (hydrogen\nwith two neutrons) due to nuclear testing, rising pollutants\nlike carbon dioxide, more than 200 never-before seen min-\neral species that have occurred only in this epoch, materi-\nals such as plastic and metals which will be long lasting\n\u201cfossils\u201d in the geologic record, and large amounts of\nearthen material moved. The biggest scientific debate with\nFigure 8.60: Bingham Canyon Mine, Utah. This open pit mine is the\nlargest man-made removal of rock in the world. this topic is the starting point. Some say that humans\u2019\ninvention of agriculture would be recognized in geologic\nstrata and that should be the starting point, around 12,000 years ago. Others link the start of the industrial revolution and\nthe subsequent addition of vast amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Either way, the idea is that alien geologists\nvisiting Earth in the distant future would easily recognize the impact of humans on the Earth as the beginning of a new\ngeologic period.

Forces involved in tectonic\nprocesses as well as gravity and igneous pluton emplacement produce strains in rocks that include folds, fractures,\nand faults. When rock experiences large amounts of shear stress and breaks with rapid, brittle deformation, energy is\nreleased in the form of seismic waves, commonly known as an earthquake. 254 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\n9.1 Stress and Strain\nStress is the force exerted per unit area and strain is the physical change that results\nin response to that force. When applied stress is greater than the internal strength of\nrock, strain results in the form of deformation of the rock caused by the stress.\nStrain in rocks can be represented as a change in rock volume and/or rock shape,\nas well as fracturing the rock. There are three types of stress: tensional, compres-\nsional, and shear. Tensional stress involves forces pulling in opposite directions,\nwhich results in strain that stretches and thins rock. Compressional stress involves\nforces pushing together, and compressional strain shows up as rock folding and\nthickening. Shear stress involves transverse forces; the strain shows up as opposing\nblocks or regions of material moving past each other.\nFigure 9.1: Types of stress.

This change is generally called deformation.\nElastic deformation is strain that is reversible after a stress is\nreleased. For example, when you stretch a rubber band, it elas-\ntically returns to its original shape after you release it. Ductile\ndeformation occurs when enough stress is applied to a mate-\nrial that the changes in its shape are permanent, and the mate-\nrial is no longer able to revert to its original shape. For example,\nif you bend a metal bar too far, it can be permanently bent out\nof shape. The point at which elastic deformation is surpassed\nand strain becomes permanent is called the yield point. In the\nfigure, yield point is where the line transitions from elastic\ndeformation to ductile deformation (the end of the dashed\nline). Brittle deformation is another critical point of no return, Figure 9.2: Different materials deform differently when stress is\nwhen rock integrity fails and the rock fractures under increas- applied.

Pore pressure is exerted on the rock by fluids in the open spaces or pores embedded\nwithin rock or sediment. Strain rate measures how quickly a material is deformed. For example, applying stress slowly\nmakes it is easier to bend a piece of wood without breaking it. Rock strength measures how easily a rock deforms under\nstress. Shale has low strength and granite has high strength. Removing heat, or decreasing the temperature, makes\nmaterials more rigid and susceptible to brittle deformation. On the other hand, heating materials make them more ductile\nand less brittle. Heated glass can be bent and stretched.\nFactor Strain response\nIncrease temperature More ductile\nIncrease strain rate More brittle\nIncrease rock strength More brittle\nTable 9.2: Relationship between factors operating on rock and the resulting strains.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 9.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Formations are recognizable rock units. Geologists use\ngeologic maps to represent where geologic formations, faults, folds, and inclined rock units are. Geologic formations are\nrecognizable, mappable rock units. Each formation on the map is indicated by a color and a label. For examples of geo-\nlogic maps, see the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) geologic map viewer.\nFormation labels include symbols that follow a specific protocol. The first one or more letters are uppercase and represent\nthe geologic time period of the formation. More than one uppercase letter indicates the formation is associated with mul-\ntiple time periods. The following lowercase letters represent the formation name, abbreviated rock description, or both.\n9.3.1 Cross Sections\nCross sections are subsurface interpretations made from surface and subsurface measurements. Maps display geology in\nthe horizontal plane, while cross sections show subsurface geology in the vertical plane. For more information on cross\nsections, check out the AAPG wiki.\n9.3.2 Strike and Dip\nGeologists use a special sym-\nbol called strike and dip to\nrepresent inclined beds.\nStrike and dip map symbols\nlook like the capital letter T,\nwith a short trunk and extra-\nwide top line. The short trunk\nrepresents the dip and the\ntop line represents the strike.\nDip is the angle that a bed Figure 9.4: Attitude symbol on\nplunges into the Earth from geologic map (with compass\ndirections for reference) showing\nthe horizontal. A number next\nstrike of N30\u00b0E and dip of 45\u00b0 to\nto the symbol represents dip the SE.\nangle. One way to visualize\nthe strike is to think about a line made by standing water on\nthe inclined layer. That line is horizontal and lies on a compass\ndirection that has some angle with respect to true north or\nFigure 9.3: \u201cStrike\u201d and \u201cdip\u201d are words used to describe the south (see figure 9.3). The strike angle is that angle measured\norientation of rock layers with respect to North/South and\nby a special compass. E.g., N 30\u00b0 E (read north 30 degrees\nhorizontal.\neast) means the horizontal line points northeast at an angle of\n30\u00b0 from true north. The strike and dip symbol is drawn on the map at the strike angle with respect to true north on the\nmap. The dip of the inclined layer represents the angle down to the layer from horizontal, in the figure 45o SE (read dipping\n45 degrees to the SE). The direction of dip would be the direction a ball would roll if set on the layer and released. A hori-\nzontal rock bed has a dip of 0\u00b0 and a vertical bed has a dip of 90\u00b0. Strike and dip considered together are called rock\nattitude.\nThis video illustrates geologic structures and associated map symbols.

Folds are most commonly formed by\ncompressional forces at depth, where hotter temperatures\nand higher confining pressures allow ductile deformation\nto occur.\nFolds are described by the orientation of their axes, axial\nplanes, and limbs. The plane that splits the fold into two\nhalves is known as the axial plane. The fold axis is the line\nalong which the bending occurs and is where the axial\nplane intersects the folded strata. The hinge line follows Figure 9.5: Model of anticline. Oldest beds are in the center and\nthe line of greatest bend in a fold. The two sides of the fold youngest on the outside. The axial plane intersects the center angle of\nbend. The hinge line follows the line of greatest bend, where the axial\nare the fold limbs.\nplane intersects the outside of the fold.\nSymmetrical folds have a vertical axial plane and limbs\nhave equal but opposite dips. Asymmetrical folds have dipping, non-vertical axial planes, where the limbs dip at different\nangles. Overturned folds have steeply dipping axial planes and the limbs dip in the same direction but usually at different\ndip angles. Recumbent folds have horizontal or nearly horizontal axial planes. When the axis of the fold plunges into the\nground, the fold is called a plunging fold. Folds are classified into five categories: anticline, syncline, monocline, dome,\nand basin. 258 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\n9.4.1 Anticline\nAnticlines are arch-like, or A-shaped, folds that are con-\nvex-upward in shape. They have downward curving limbs\nand beds that dip down and away from the central fold\naxis. In anticlines, the oldest rock strata are in the center\nof the fold, along the axis, and the younger beds are on\nthe outside. Since geologic maps show the intersection of\nsurface topography with underlying geologic structures, an\nanticline on a geologic map can be identified by both the\nattitude of the strata forming the fold and the older age of\nthe rocks inside the fold. An antiform has the same shape\nas an anticline, but the relative ages of the beds in the fold\ncannot be determined. Oil geologists are interested in anti-\nclines because they can form oil traps, where oil migrates\nup along the limbs of the fold and accumulates in the high\npoint along the fold axis.\nFigure 9.6: An Anticline near Bcharre, Lebanon.\n9.4.2 Syncline\nhttps://sketchfab.com/models/3f0259ea2c6b4807a32fe3c950d13324/embed\n3D Model 9.1: Synclinal fold.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this interactive 3D model via the QR code, or visit\nhttps://sketchfab.com/3d-models/synclinal-fold-macigno-formation-3f0259ea2c6b4807a32fe3c950d13324.\nSynclines are trough-like, or U shaped, folds that are concave-upward in shape. They have beds that dip down and in\ntoward the central fold axis. In synclines, older rock is on the outside of the fold and the youngest rock is inside of the fold\naxis. A synform has the shape of a syncline but like an antiform, does not have distinguishable age zones.\n9.4.3 Monocline\nMonoclines are step-like folds, in which flat rocks are upwarped or\ndownwarped, then continue flat. Monoclines are relatively com-\nmon on the Colorado Plateau where they form \u201creefs,\u201d which are\nridges that act as topographic barriers and should not be confused\nwith ocean reefs (see chapter 5). Capitol Reef is an example of a\nmonocline in Utah. Monoclines can be caused by bending of shal-\nlower sedimentary strata as faults grow below them. These faults\nare commonly called \u201cblind faults\u201d because they end before reach-\ning the surface and can be either normal or reverse faults.\nFigure 9.7: Monocline at Colorado National Monument. CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 259\n9.4.4 Dome\nA dome is a symmetrical to semi-symmetrical upwarping of rock beds.\nDomes have a shape like an inverted bowl, similar to an architectural\ndome on a building. Examples of domes in Utah include the San Rafael\nSwell, Harrisburg Junction Dome, and Henry Mountains. Domes are\nformed from compressional forces, underlying igneous intrusions (see\nchapter 4), by salt diapirs, or even impacts, like upheaval dome in\nCanyonlands National Park.\n9.4.5 Basin\nA basin is the inverse of a\ndome, a bowl-shaped\ndepression in a rock bed.\nThe Uinta Basin in Utah is\nan example of a basin.\nFigure 9.8: This prominent circular feature in the Sahara\nSome structural basins are\ndesert of Mauritania has attracted attention since the\nalso sedimentary basins earliest space missions because it forms a conspicuous\nbull\u2019s-eye in the otherwise rather featureless expanse of\nthat collect large quanti-\nthe desert.

Regardless of the cause, as the basin sinks or subsides, it can\naccumulate more sediment because the weight of the sediment causes\nmore subsidence in a positive-feedback loop. There are active sedimentary\nbasins all over the world. An example of a rapidly subsiding basin in Utah is\nthe Oquirrh Basin, dated to the Pennsylvanian-Permian age, which has accu-\nmulated over 9,144 m (30,000 ft) of fossiliferous sandstones, shales, and\nlimestones. These strata can be seen in the Wasatch Mountains along the\neast side of Utah Valley, especially on Mt. Timpanogos and in Provo Canyon.\nFigure 9.9: The Denver Basin is an active\nsedimentary basin at the eastern extent of the\nRocky Mountains. As sediment accumulates, the\nbasin subsides, creating a basin-shape of beds\nthat are all dipping towards the center of the\nbasin. 260 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 9.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Normal and reverse faults display vertical, also\nknown as dip-slip, motion. Dip-slip motion consists of rel-\native up-and-down movement along a dipping fault\nbetween two blocks, the hanging wall and footwall. In a\ndip-slip system, the footwall is below the fault plane and\nthe hanging wall is above the fault plane. A good way to\nremember this is to imagine a mine tunnel running along a\nfault; the hanging wall would be where a miner would\nhang a lantern and the footwall would be at the miner\u2019s\nfeet.\nFaulting as a term refers to rupture of rocks. Such ruptures\noccur at plate boundaries but can also occur in plate inte-\nFigure 9.10: Common terms used for normal faults. Normal faults form\nriors as well. Faults slip along the fault plane. The fault when the hanging wall move down relative to the footwall.\nscarp is the offset of the surface produced where the fault\nbreaks through the surface. Slickensides are polished, often grooved surfaces along the fault plane created by friction\nduring the movement.\nA joint or fracture is a plane of brittle deformation in rock created by movement that is not offset or sheared. Joints\ncan result from many processes, such as cooling, depressurizing, or folding. Joint systems may be regional affecting many\nsquare miles. CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 261\n9.5.1 Normal Faults\nNormal faults move by a vertical motion where the hanging-wall\nmoves downward relative to the footwall along the dip of the\nfault. Normal faults are created by tensional forces in the crust.\nNormal faults and tensional forces commonly occur at divergent\nplate boundaries, where the crust is being stretched by ten-\nsional stresses (see chapter 2). Examples of normal faults in\nUtah are the Wasatch Fault, the Hurricane Fault, and other faults\nbounding the valleys in the Basin and Range province.\nFigure 9.11: Example of a normal fault in an outcrop of the\nPennsylvanian Honaker Trail Formation near Moab, Utah.\nGrabens, horsts, and half-grabens are blocks of crust or\nrock bounded by normal faults (see chapter 2). Grabens\ndrop down relative to adjacent blocks and create valleys.\nHorsts rise up relative to adjacent down-dropped blocks\nand become areas of higher topography. Where occurring\nFigure 9.12: Faulting that occurs in the crust under tensional stress.\ntogether, horsts and grabens create a symmetrical pattern\nof valleys surrounded by normal faults on both sides and mountains. Half-grabens are a one-sided version of a horst and\ngraben, where blocks are tilted by a normal fault on one side, creating an asymmetrical valley-mountain arrangement.\nThe mountain-valleys of the Basin and Range Province of Western Utah and Nevada consist of a series of full and half-\ngrabens from the Salt Lake Valley to the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\nNormal faults do not continue clear into the mantle. In the Basin and Range Province, the dip of a normal fault tends to\ndecrease with depth, i.e., the fault angle becomes shallower and more horizontal as it goes deeper. Such decreasing dips\nhappen when large amounts of extension occur along very low-angle normal faults, known as detachment faults. The\nnormal faults of the Basin and Range, produced by tension in the crust, appear to become detachment faults at greater\ndepths.\n9.5.2 Reverse Faults\nIn reverse faults, compressional forces cause the hang-\ning wall to move up relative to the footwall. A thrust fault\nis a reverse fault where the fault plane has a low dip angle\nof less than 45\u00b0. Thrust faults carry older rocks on top of\nyounger rocks and can even cause repetition of rock units\nin the stratigraphic record.\nConvergent plate boundaries with subduction zones cre-\nate a special type of \u201creverse\u201d fault called a megathrust\nfault where denser oceanic crust drives down beneath\nless dense overlying crust. Megathrust faults cause the\nlargest magnitude earthquakes yet measured and com-\nmonly cause massive destruction and tsunamis. Figure 9.13: Simplified block diagram of a reverse fault. 262 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\nFigure 9.14: Terminology of thrust faults (low-angle reverse faults). A klippe is the remnant of the\nhangingwall (aka nappe), where the surrounding material has been eroded away. A window is where\npart of the hangingwall has been eroded away to expose the footwall (autochton). Note the symbol\nshows flags on the overlying thrust plate.\nFigure 9.15: Thrust fault in the North Qilian Mountains (Qilian Shan). The blueish rock is a thick fault gouge of basement, the redish stuff is\nabove the fault plane. Everything thrust over the brown quaternary conglomerates (right part of the picture). The fault plane dips 65 degrees to\nthe South.\n9.5.3 Strike\u2013Slip Faults\nStrike-slip faults have side-to-side motion. Strike-slip faults are most commonly associated with transform plate\nboundaries and are prevalent in transform fracture zones along mid-ocean ridges. In pure strike-slip motion, fault blocks\non either side of the fault do not move up or down relative to each other, rather move laterally, side to side. The direction\nof strike-slip movement is determined by an observer standing on a block on one side of the fault. If the block on the\nopposing side of the fault moves left relative to the observer\u2019s block, this is called sinistral motion. If the opposing block\nmoves right, it is dextral motion.

Ten-\nsional stresses create transtensional features with normal faults and basins, such as the Salton Sea in California. Com-\npressional stresses create transpressional features with reverse faults and cause small-scale mountain building, such\nas the San Gabriel Mountains in California. The faults that splay off transpression or transtension features are known as\nflower structures.\nAn example of a dextral, right-lateral strike-slip fault is\nthe San Andreas Fault, which denotes a transform bound-\nary between the North American and Pacific plates. An\nexample of a sinistral, left-lateral strike-slip fault is the\nDead Sea fault in Jordan and Israel.\nFigure 9.16: Flower structures created by strike-slip faults. Depending\non the relative movement in relation to the bend in the fault, flower\nstructures can create basins or mountains.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Seismic energy thus released travels through the Earth in the form of seismic waves. Most earthquakes\noccur along active plate boundaries. Intraplate earthquakes (not along plate boundaries) occur and are still poorly under-\nstood. The USGS Earthquakes Hazards Program has a real time map showing the most recent earthquakes.\n9.6.1 How Earthquakes Happen\nThe release of seismic energy is explained by the elastic\nrebound theory. When rock is strained to the point that it\nundergoes brittle deformation, The place where the initial\noffsetting rupture takes place between the fault blocks is\ncalled the focus. This offset propagates along the fault,\nwhich is known as the fault plane.\nThe fault blocks of persistent faults like the Wasatch Fault\n(Utah), that show recurring movements, are locked\ntogether by friction. Over hundreds to thousands of years,\nstress builds up along the fault until it overcomes frictional\nFigure 9.17: Process of elastic rebound: a) Undeformed state, b)\nresistance, rupturing the rock and initiating fault move-\naccumulation of elastic strain, and c) brittle failure and release of elastic\nment. The deformed unbroken rocks snap back toward strain.\ntheir original shape in a process called elastic rebound.\nThink of bending a stick until it breaks; stored energy is released, and the broken pieces return to near their original orien-\ntation.\nBending, the ductile deformation of the rocks near a fault, reflects a build-up of stress. In earthquake-prone areas like\nCalifornia, strain gauges are used to measure this bending and help seismologists, scientists who study earthquakes,\nunderstand more about predicting them. In locations where the fault is not locked, seismic stress causes continuous,\ngradual displacement between the fault blocks called fault creep. Fault creep occurs along some parts of the San\nAndreas Fault (California).\nAfter an initial earthquake, continuous application of stress in the crust causes elastic energy to begin to build again during\na period of inactivity along the fault. The accumulating elastic strain may be periodically released to produce small earth-\nquakes on or near the main fault called foreshocks. Foreshocks can occur hours or days before a large earthquake, or CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 265\nmay not occur at all. The main release of energy during the major earthquake is known as the mainshock. Aftershocks\nmay follow the mainshock to adjust new strain produced during the fault movement and generally decrease over time.\n9.6.2 Focus and Epicenter\nThe earthquake focus, also called hypocenter, is the initial point of rupture\nand displacement of the rock moves from the hypocenter along the fault sur-\nface. The earthquake focus or hypocenter is the point along the fault plane\nfrom which initial seismic waves spread outward and is always at some depth\nbelow the ground surface. From the focus, rock displacement propagates up,\ndown, and laterally along the fault plane. This displacement produces shock\nwaves called seismic waves. The larger the displacement between the oppos-\ning fault blocks and the further the displacement propagates along the fault\nsurface, the more seismic energy is released and the greater the amount and\ntime of shaking is produced. The epicenter is the location on the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface vertically above the focus. This is the location that most news reports give\nFigure 9.18: The hypocenter is the point along\nbecause it is the center of the area where people are affected.\nthe fault plane in the subsurface from which\nseismic energy emanates. The epicenter is the\npoint on land surface vertically above the\n9.6.3 Seismic Waves\nhypocenter.\nTo understand earthquakes and how earthquake energy moves through the Earth, consider the basic properties of waves.\nWaves describe how energy moves through a medium, such as rock or unconsolidated sediments in the case of earth-\nquakes. Wave amplitude indicates the magnitude or height of earthquake motion. Wavelength is the distance between\ntwo successive peaks of a wave. Wave frequency is the number of repetitions of the motion over a period of time, cycles\nper time unit. Period, which is the amount of time for a wave to travel one wavelength, is the inverse of frequency. When\nmultiple waves combine, they can interfere with each other (see figure 9.19). When waves combine in sync, they produce\nconstructive interference, where the influence of one wave adds to and magnifies the other. If waves are out of sync, they\nproduce destructive interference, which diminishes the amplitudes of both waves. If two combined waves have the same\namplitude and frequency but are one-half wavelength out of sync, the resulting destructive interference can eliminate\neach wave. These processes of wave amplitude, frequency, period, and constructive and destructive interference deter-\nmine the magnitude and intensity of earthquakes.\nSeismic waves are the physical expression of energy released by the\nelastic rebound of rock within displaced fault blocks and are felt as an\nearthquake. Seismic waves occur as body waves and surface waves.\nBody waves pass underground through the Earth\u2019s interior body and are\nthe first seismic waves to propagate out from the focus. Body waves\ninclude primary (P) waves and secondary (S) waves. P waves are the\nfastest body waves and move through rock via compression, very much\nlike sound waves move through air. Rock particles move forward and back\nduring passage of the P waves, enabling them to travel through solids, liq-\nuids, plasma, and gases. S waves travel slower, following P waves, and\npropagate as shear waves that move rock particles from side to side.\nBecause they are restricted to lateral movement, S waves can only travel\nthrough solids but not liquids, plasma, or gases.\nFigure 9.19: Example of constructive and destructive\ninterference; note red line representing the results of\ninterference. 266 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\nDuring an earthquake, body waves pass through the Earth\nand into the mantle as a sub-spherical wave front. Consider-\ning a point on a wave front, the path followed by a specific\npoint on the spreading wave front is called a seismic ray and\na seismic ray reaches a specific seismograph located at one\nof thousands of seismic monitoring stations scattered over the\nEarth. Density increases with depth in the Earth, and since\nseismic velocity increases with density, a process called\nFigure 9.20: P-waves are Figure 9.21: S waves are shear.\ncompressional. refraction causes earthquake rays to curve away from the\nvertical and bend back toward the surface, passing through different bodies of rock along\nthe way.\nSurface waves are produced when body waves from the focus strike the Earth\u2019s surface. Surface waves travel along\nthe Earth\u2019s surface, radiating outward from the epicenter. Surface waves take the form of rolling waves called Raleigh\nWaves and side to side waves called Love Waves (watch videos for wave propagation animations). Surface waves are\nproduced primarily as the more energetic S waves strike the surface from below with some surface wave energy con-\ntributed by P waves (videos courtesy blog.Wolfram.com). Surface waves travel more slowly than body waves and because\nof their complex horizontal and vertical movement, surface waves are responsible for most of the damage caused by an\nearthquake. Love waves produce predominantly horizontal ground shaking and, ironically from their name, are the most\ndestructive. Rayleigh waves produce an elliptical motion with longitudinal dilation and compression, like ocean waves.\nHowever, Raleigh waves cause rock particles to move in a direction opposite to that of water particles in ocean waves.\nThe Earth has been described as ringing like a bell after an earthquake with earthquake energy reverberating inside it. Like\nother waves, seismic waves refract (bend) and bounce (reflect) when passing through rocks of differing densities. S waves,\nwhich cannot move through liquid, are blocked by the Earth\u2019s liquid outer core, creating an S wave shadow zone on the\nside of the planet opposite to the earthquake focus. P waves, on the other hand, pass through the core, but are refracted\ninto the core by the difference of density at the core\u2013mantle boundary. This has the effect of creating a cone shaped P\nwave shadow zone on parts of the other side of the Earth from the focus.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 267\n9.6.4 Induced Seismicity\nEarthquakes known as induced seismicity occur near natural gas extrac-\ntion sites because of human activity. Injection of waste fluids in the ground,\ncommonly a byproduct of an extraction process for natural gas known as\nfracking, can increase the outward pressure that liquid in the pores of a\nrock exerts, known as pore pressure. The increase in pore pressure\ndecreases the frictional forces that keep rocks from sliding past each other,\nessentially lubricating fault planes. This effect is causing earthquakes to\noccur near injection sites, in a human induced activity known as induced\nseismicity. The significant increase in drilling activity in the central United\nStates has spurred the requirement for the disposal of significant amounts\nof waste drilling fluid, resulting in a measurable change in the cumulative\nnumber of earthquakes experienced in the region. Figure 9.22: Frequency of earthquakes in the central\nUnited States.

Major earthquakes of moment magnitude 7.0 and higher are extremely rare. The\nU. S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquakes Hazards Program real-time map shows the location and magnitude of recent\nearthquakes around the world.\nTo accurately study seismic waves, geologists use seismographs that can measure even the slightest ground vibrations.\nEarly 20th-century seismograms use a weighted pen (pendulum) suspended by a long spring above a recording device\nfixed solidly to the ground. The recording device is a rotating drum mounted with a continuous strip of paper. During an\nearthquake, the suspended pen stays motionless and records ground movement on the paper strip. The resulting graph\na seismogram. Digital versions use magnets, wire coils, electrical sensors, and digital signals instead of mechanical pens,\nsprings, drums, and paper. A seismograph array is multiple seismographs configured to measure vibrations in three direc-\ntions: north-south (x axis), east-west (y axis), and up-down (z axis).\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

After an earthquake, P waves will\nappear first on a seismogram, followed by S waves, and\nfinally surface waves, which have the largest amplitude. It\nis important to note that surface waves lose energy\nquickly, so they are not measurable at great distances from\nthe epicenter. These time differences determine the dis-\ntance but not the direction of the epicenter. By using wave\narrival times recorded on seismographs at multiple sta-\ntions, seismologists can apply triangulation to pin point the\nlocation of the epicenter of an earthquake. At least three\nseismograph stations are needed for triangulation. The dis-\ntance from each station to the epicenter is plotted as the Figure 9.23: A seismogram showing the arrivals of the P, S, and surface\nradius of a circle. The epicenter is demarked where the cir- waves.\ncles intersect. This method also works in 3D, using\nmulti-axis seismographs and sphere radii to calculate the underground depth of the focus.

Note that this map does not show all of the\nworld\u2019s seismic stations, just one of the networks of stations scientists use to measure\nseismic activity.\nThe International Registry of Seismograph Stations lists more than 20,000 seismographs on the planet. By comparing\ndata from multiple seismographs, scientists can map the properties of the inside of the Earth, detect detonations of large\nexplosive devices, and predict tsunamis. The Global Seismic Network, a worldwide set of linked seismographs that elec-\ntronically distribute real-time data, includes more than 150 stations that meet specific design and precision standards. The\nUSArray is a network of hundreds of permanent and transportable seismographs in the United States that are used to map\nthe subsurface activity of earthquakes (see video).\nAlong with monitoring for earthquakes and related hazards, the Global Seismograph Network helps detect nuclear\nweapons testing, which is monitored by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization. Most recently, seismo-\ngraphs have been used to determine nuclear weapons testing by North Korea. 270 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Warmer rocks have a lower density\nand transmit earthquake waves slower. When the arrival\ntimes of seismic rays at individual seismic stations are\ncompared to arrival times predicted by PREM, differences\nare called seismic anomalies and can be measured for\nFigure 9.25: Speed of seismic waves with depth in the earth. Two\nbodies of rock within the earth from seismic rays passing\nthousand kilometers is 1240 miles.\nthrough them at stations of the seismic network. Because\nseismic rays travel at all angles from lots of earthquakes and arrive at lots of stations of the seismic network, like CT scans\nof the body, variations in the properties of the rock bodies allow 3D images to be constructed of the rock bodies through\nwhich the rays passed. Seismologists are thus able to construct 3D images of the interior of the Earth..\nFor example, seismologists have mapped the Farallon Plate, a tectonic plate that subducted beneath North America dur-\ning the last several million years, and the Yellowstone magma chamber, which is a product of the Yellowstone hot spot\nunder the North American continent. Peculiarities of the Farallon Plate subduction are thought to be responsible for many\nfeatures of western North America including the Rocky Mountains (see chapter 8). CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 271\nFigure 9.26: Simplified and interpreted P- and S-wave velocity variations in the\nmantle across southern North America showing the subducted Farallon Plate.\nFigure 9.27: Tomographic image of the Farallon plate in\nthe mantle below North America.\n9.7.4 Earthquake Magnitude and Intensity\nRichter Scale\nMagnitude is the measure of the energy released by an earthquake. The Richter scale (ML), the first and most well-known\nmagnitude scale, was developed by Charles F. Richter (1900-1985) at the California Institute of Technology. This was the\nmagnitude scale used historically by early seismologists. Used by early seismologists, Richter magnitude (ML) is deter-\nmined from the maximum amplitude of the pen tracing on the seismogram recording. Adjustments for epicenter distance\nfrom the seismograph are made using the arrival-time differences of S and P waves.\nThe Richter Scale is logarithmic, based on powers of 10. This means an increase of one Richter unit represents a 10-fold\nincrease in seismic-wave amplitude or in other words, a magnitude 6 earthquake shakes the ground 10 times more than a 272 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\nmagnitude 5. However, the actual energy released for each magnitude unit is 32 times greater, which means a magnitude\n6 earthquake releases 32 times more energy than a magnitude 5.\nThe Richter Scale was developed for earthquakes in Southern California, using local seismographs. It has limited applica-\ntions for larger distances and very large earthquakes. Therefore, most agencies no longer use the Richter Scale. Moment\nmagnitude (MW), which is measured using seismic arrays and generates values comparable to the Richter Scale, is more\naccurate for measuring earthquakes across the Earth, including large earthquakes, although they require more time to cal-\nculate. News media often report Richter magnitudes right after an earthquake occurs even though scientific calculations\nnow use moment magnitudes.\nMoment Magnitude Scale\nThe moment magnitude scale depicts the absolute size of earthquakes, comparing information from multiple locations\nand using a measurement of actual energy released calculated from cross-sectional area of rupture, amount of slippage,\nand the rigidity of the rocks. Because each earthquake occurs in a unique geologic setting and the rupture area is often\nhard to measure, estimates of moment magnitude can take days or even months to calculate.\nLike the Richter Scale, the moment magnitude scale is logarithmic. Magnitude values of the two scales are approxi-\nmately equal, except for very large earthquakes. Both scales are used for reporting earthquake magnitude. The Richter\nScale provides a quick magnitude estimate immediately following the quake and thus, is usually reported in news\naccounts. Moment magnitude calculations take much longer but are more accurate and thus, more useful for scientific\nanalysis.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

This scale uses a I (Roman numeral one) rating for the lowest intensity and X (ten)\nfor the highest (see table) and can vary depending on epicenter location and population density, such as urban versus\nrural settings. Historically, scientists used the MMI Scale to categorize earthquakes before they developed quantitative\nmeasurements of magnitude. Intensity maps show locations of the most severe damage, based on residential question-\nnaires, local news articles, and on-site assessment reports.

Intensity however, i.e. how much the\nground shakes, is a determined by several factors.\nEarthquake magnitude\u2014In general, the larger the magnitude, the stronger the shaking and the longer the shaking will\nlast.\nThis table is taken from from the USGS and shows scales of magnitude and Mercalli Intensity, and descriptions of shaking\nand resulting damage.\nModified Mercalli\nMagnitude Shaking/damage description\nIntensity\n1.0-3.0 I Only felt by a very few.\n3.0-3.9 II-III Noticeable indoors, especially on upper floors.\n4.0-4.9 IV-V Most to all feel it. Dishes, doors, cars shake and possibly break.\n5.0-5.9 VI-VII Everyone feels it. Some items knocked over or broken. Building damage possible.\nFrightening amounts of shaking. Significant damage especially with poorly constructed\n6.0-6.9 VII-IX\nbuildings.\n\u2265 7.0 \u2265 VIII Significant destruction of buildings. Potential for objects to be thrown in air from shaking.\nTable 9.4: Mercalli Intensity as it relates to magnitude.\nLocation and direction\u2014Shaking is more severe closer to the epicenter. The severity of shaking is influenced by the loca-\ntion of the observer relative to epicenter, direction of rupture propagation, and path of greatest rupture.\nLocal geologic conditions\u2014Seismic waves are affected by the nature of the ground materials through which they pass.\nDifferent materials respond differently to an earthquake. Think of shaking a block of Jello versus a meatloaf, one will jiggle CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 275\nmuch more when hit by waves of the same amplitude. The ground\u2019s response to shaking depends on the degree of sub-\nstrate consolidation. Solid sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic bedrock shakes less than unconsolidated sediments.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Seismic energy is transmitted by wave velocity and ampli-\ntude. When seismic waves slow down, energy is transferred to the amplitude, increasing the motion of surface waves,\nwhich in turn amplifies ground shaking.\nFocus depth\u2014Deeper earthquakes cause less surface shaking because much of their energy, transmitted as body waves,\nis lost before reaching the surface. Recall that surface waves are generated by P and S waves impacting the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface.\n9.8.2 Factors that Determine Destruction\nJust as certain conditions will impact intensity of ground-shaking, several factors affect how much destruction is caused.\nBuilding materials\u2014The flexibility of a building material\ndetermines its resistance to earthquake damage. Unrein-\nforced masonry (URM) is the material most devastated by\nground shaking. Wood framing fastened with nails bends\nand flexes during seismic wave passage and is more likely\nto survive intact. Steel also has the ability to deform elasti-\ncally before brittle failure. The Fix the Bricks campaign in\nSalt Lake City, Utah has good information on URMs and\nearthquake safety.\nIntensity and duration\u2014Greater shaking and duration of\nshaking causes more destruction than lower and shorter\nshaking.\nFigure 9.29: Example of devastation on unreinforced masonry by\nseismic motion.\nResonance\u2014Resonance occurs when seismic wave fre-\nquency matches a building\u2019s natural shaking frequency\nand increases the shaking happened in the 1985 Mexico City Earthquake, where buildings of heights between 6 and 15\nstories were especially vulnerable to earthquake damage. Skyscrapers designed with earthquake resilience have dampers\nand base isolation features to reduce resonance. 276 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\nResonance is influenced by the properties of the building materials. Changes in the structural integrity of a building can\nalter resonance. Conversely, changes in measured resonance can indicate a potentially altered structural integrity.\nThese two videos discuss why buildings fall during earthquakes and a modern procedure to reduce potential earthquake\ndestruction for larger buildings.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 277\n9.8.3 Earthquake Recurrence\nA long hiatus in activity on along a fault segment with a his-\ntory of recurring earthquakes is known as a seismic gap.\nThe lack of activity may indicate the fault segment is\nlocked, which may produce a buildup of strain and higher\nprobability of an earthquake recurring. Geologists dig earth-\nquake trenches across faults to estimate the frequency of\npast earthquake occurrences. Trenches are effective for\nfaults with relatively long recurrence intervals, roughly 100s\nto 10,000s of years between significant earthquakes.\nTrenches are less useful in areas with more frequent earth-\nquakes because they usually have more recorded data.\n9.8.4 Earthquake Distribution\nThis video shows the distribution of significant earthquakes\nFigure 9.30: Fault trench near Teton Fault.

Examples of subduction-zone earthquake areas include the Sumatran\nIslands, Aleutian Islands, west coast of South America, and Cascadia Subduction Zone off the coast of Washington and\nOregon. See chapter 2 for more information about subduction zones.\nCollision zones\u2014Collisions between converging continental plates create broad earthquake zones that may generate\ndeep, large earthquakes from the remnants of past subduction events or other deep-crustal processes. The Himalayan\nMountains (northern border of the Indian subcontinent) and Alps (southern Europe and Asia) are active regions of colli-\nsion-zone earthquakes. See chapter 2 for more information about collision zones.\nTransform boundaries\u2014Strike-slip faults created at transform boundaries produce moderate-to-large earthquakes,\nusually having a maximum moment magnitude of about 8. The San Andreas Fault (California) is an example of a trans-\nform-boundary earthquake zone. Haiti\u2019s Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system, which caused the 2010 earthquake near\nPort-au-Prince (see below), and Septentrional Fault, which destroyed Cap-Ha\u00eftien in 1842 and shook Cuba in 2020, are also 278 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\ntransform faults. Other examples are the Alpine Fault (New Zealand) and Anatolian Faults (Turkey). See chapter 2 for more\ninformation about transform boundaries.\nDivergent boundaries\u2014Continental rifts and mid-ocean ridges found at divergent boundaries generally produce mod-\nerate earthquakes. Examples of active earthquake zones include the East African Rift System (southwestern Asia through\neastern Africa), Iceland, and Basin and Range province (Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, and northwestern Mexico). See\nchapter 2 for more information about divergent boundaries.\nIntraplate earthquakes\u2014Intraplate earthquakes are not found near\ntectonic plate boundaries, but generally occur in areas of weakened\ncrust or concentrated tectonic stress. The New Madrid seismic zone,\nwhich covers Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Indiana, is\nthought to represent the failed Reelfoot rift. The failed rift zone weak-\nened the crust, making it more responsive to tectonic plate movement\nand interaction. Geologists theorize the infrequently occurring earth-\nquakes are produced by low strain rates.\nFigure 9.31: High density of earthquakes in the New\nMadrid seismic zone.\n9.8.5 Secondary Hazards Caused by Earthquakes\nMost earthquake damage is caused by ground shaking and fault block displacement. In addition, there are secondary haz-\nards that endanger structures and people, in some cases after the shaking stops.\nBuildings toppled from liquefaction during a 7.5 magnitude\nearthquake in Japan.\nLiquefaction\u2014Liquefaction occurs when water-satu-\nrated, unconsolidated sediments, usually silt or sand,\nbecome fluid-like from shaking. The shaking breaks the\ncohesion between grains of sediment, creating a slurry of\nparticles suspended in water. Buildings settle or tilt in the\nliquified sediment, which looks very much like quicksand\nin the movies. Liquefaction also creates sand volcanoes,\ncone-shaped features created when liquefied sand is\nsquirted through an overlying and usually finer-grained\nFigure 9.32: Buildings toppled from liquefaction during a 7.5 magnitude\nearthquake in Japan. layer.

When the sea floor is offset by fault\nmovement or an underwater landslide, the ground displacement lifts a\nvolume of ocean water and generates the tsunami wave. Ocean wave\nbehavior, which includes tsunamis, is covered in chapter 12. Tsunami\nwaves are fast-moving with low amplitude in deep ocean water but\ngrow significantly in amplitude in the shallower waters approaching\nshore. When a tsunami is about to strike land, the drawback of the\ntrough preceding the wave crest causes the water to recede dramati-\nFigure 9.33: As the ocean depth becomes shallower, the\nwave slows down and pile up on top of itself, making cally from shore.

Early warning systems help\nmitigate the loss of life caused by tsunamis. 280 | CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES\nLandslides\u2014Shaking can trigger landslides (see chapter\n10). In 1992 a moment magnitude 5.9 earthquake in St.\nGeorge, Utah, caused a landslide that destroyed several\nstructures in the Balanced Rock Hills subdivision in\nSpringville, Utah.\nSeiches\u2014Seiches are waves generated in lakes by earth-\nquakes. The shaking may cause water to slosh back-and-\nforth or sometimes change the lake depth. Seiches in\nHebgen Lake during a 1959 earthquake caused major\ndestruction to nearby structures and roads.\nThis video shows a seich generated in a swimming pool by\nan earthquake in Nepal in 2015.\nFigure 9.34: Schoolhouse in Thistle, Utah destroyed by a landslide.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The 1964 Alaska earthquake produced significant land elevation changes, with\nthe differences in height between the hanging wall and footwall ranging from one to several meters (3\u201330 ft).

A sequence of large (Mw >7) occurred from\nDecember 1811 to February 1812 in the New Madrid area of Missouri. The earthquakes damaged houses in St. Louis,\naffected the stream course of the Mississippi River, and leveled the town of New Madrid. These earthquakes were the\nresult of intraplate seismic activity.\nCharleston (1886): The 1886 earthquake in Charleston South Carolina was a moment magnitude 7.0, with a Mercalli inten-\nsity of X, caused significant ground motion, and killed at least 60 people. This intraplate earthquake was likely associated\nwith ancient faults created during the breakup of Pangea. The earthquake caused significant liquefaction. Scientists esti-\nmate the recurrence of destructive earthquakes in this area with an interval of approximately 1500 to 1800 years.\nGreat San Francisco earthquake and eire (1906): On April 18, 1906, a large earthquake, with an estimated moment mag-\nnitude of 7.8 and MMI of X, occurred along the San Andreas Fault near San Francisco California. There were multiple after-\nshocks followed by devastating fires, resulting in about 80% of the city being destroyed. Geologists G.K.

Rainier (Washington).\nShaanxi, China (1556): On January 23, 1556 an earthquake of an approximate moment magnitude 8 hit central China,\nkilling approximately 830,000 people in what is considered the most deadly earthquake in history. The high death toll was\nattributed to the collapse of cave dwellings (yaodong) built in loess deposits, which are large banks of windblown, com-\npacted sediment (see chapter 5). Earthquakes in this are region are believed to have a recurrence interval of 1000 years.\nLisbon, Portugal (1755): On November 1, 1755 an earthquake with an estimated moment magnitude range of 8\u20139 struck\nLisbon, Portugal, killing between 10,000 to 17,400 people. The earthquake was followed by a tsunami, which brought the\ntotal death toll to between 30,000-70,000 people.\nValdivia, Chile (1960): The May 22, 1960 earthquake was the most powerful earthquake ever measured, with a moment\nmagnitude 9.4\u20139.6 and lasting an estimated 10 minutes. It triggered tsunamis that destroyed houses across the Pacific\nOcean in Japan and Hawaii and caused vents to erupt on the Puyehue-Cord\u00f3n Caulle (Chile).\nVideo describing the tsunami produced by the 1960 Chili earthquake.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The high death-toll is attributed to people still\nbeing asleep or at home and most buildings being made of unreinforced masonry.\nSumatra, Indonesia (2004): On December 26, 2004, slippage of the Sunda megathrust fault generated a moment mag-\nnitude 9.0\u20139.3 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. This megathrust fault is created by the Australia plate sub-\nducting below the Sunda plate in the Indian Ocean. The resultant tsunamis created massive waves as tall as 24 m (79 ft)\nwhen they reached the shore and killed more than an estimated 200,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline.\nHaiti (2010): The moment magnitude 7 earthquake that occurred on January 12, 2010, was followed by many aftershocks\nof magnitude 4.5 or higher. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have died as result of the earthquake. The wide-\nspread infrastructure damage and crowded conditions contributed to a cholera outbreak, which is estimated to have\ncaused thousands more deaths.\nT\u014dhoku, Japan (2011): Because most Japanese buildings are designed to tolerate earthquakes, the moment magnitude\n9.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011, was not as destructive as the tsunami it created. The tsunami caused more than 15,000\ndeaths and tens of billions of dollars in damage, including the destructive meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 9.9 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Strain is produced by stress and\nproduces three types of deformation: elastic, ductile, and brittle. Geological maps are two-dimensional representations\nof surface formations which are the surface expression of three-dimensional geologic structures in the subsurface. The\nmap symbol called strike and dip or rock attitude indicates the orientation of rock strata with reference to north-south and\nhorizontal. Folded rock layers are categorized by the orientation of their limbs, fold axes and axial planes. Faults result\nwhen stress forces exceed rock integrity and friction, leading to brittle deformation and breakage. The three major fault\ntypes are described by the movement of their fault blocks: normal, strike-slip, and reverse.\nEarthquakes, or seismic activity, are caused by sudden brittle deformation accompanied by elastic rebound. The release\nof energy from an earthquake focus is generated as seismic waves. P and S waves travel through the Earth\u2019s interior. When\nthey strike the outer crust, they create surface waves. Human activities, such as mining and nuclear detonations, can also\ncause seismic activity. Seismographs measure the energy released by an earthquake using a logarithmic scale of mag-\nnitude units; the Moment Magnitude Scale has replaced the original Richter Scale. Earthquake intensity is the perceived\neffects of ground shaking and physical damage. The location of earthquake foci is determined from triangulation readings\nfrom multiple seismographs. CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND EARTHQUAKES | 285\nEarthquake rays passing through rocks of the Earth\u2019s interior and measured at the seismographs of the worldwide Seismic\nNetwork allow 3-D imaging of buried rock masses as seismic tomographs.\nEarthquakes are associated with plate tectonics. They usually occur around the active plate boundaries, including zones\nof subduction, collision, and transform and divergent boundaries. Areas of intraplate earthquakes also occur. The dam-\nage caused by earthquakes depends on a number of factors, including magnitude, location and direction, local conditions,\nbuilding materials, intensity and duration, and resonance. In addition to damage directly caused by ground shaking, sec-\nondary earthquake hazards include liquefaction, tsunamis, landslides, seiches, and elevation changes.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 9 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Mass wasting is the downhill movement of rock and soil material due to gravity. The term landslide\nis often used as a synonym for mass wasting, but mass wasting is a much broader term referring to all movement downs-\nlope. Geologically, landslide is a general term for mass wasting that involves fast-moving geologic material. Loose mate-\nrial along with overlying soils are what typically move during a mass-wasting event. Moving blocks of bedrock are called\nrock topples, rock slides, or rock falls, depending on the dominant motion of the blocks. Movements of dominantly liquid\nmaterial are called flows. Movement by mass wasting can be slow or rapid. Rapid movement can be dangerous, such as\nduring debris flows. Areas with steep topography and rapid rainfall, such as the California coast, Rocky Mountain Region,\nand Pacific Northwest, are particularly susceptible to hazardous mass-wasting events.\n10.1 Slope Strength\nMass wasting occurs when a slope fails. A slope fails when it is too\nsteep and unstable for existing materials and conditions. Slope sta-\nbility is ultimately determined by two principal factors: the slope\nangle and the strength of the underlying material. Force of gravity,\nwhich plays a part in mass wasting, is constant on the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface for the most part, although small variations exist depending on\nthe elevation and density of the underlying rock. In the figure, a block\nof rock situated on a slope is pulled down toward the Earth\u2019s center\nby the force of gravity (fg). The gravitational force acting on a slope\ncan be divided into two components: the shear or driving force (fs)\npushing the block down the slope, and the normal or resisting force\n(fn) pushing into the slope, which produces friction. The relationship\nFigure 10.1: Forces on a block on an inclined plane (fg = force\nbetween shear force and normal force is called shear strength. of gravity; fn = normal force; fs = shear force).\nWhen the normal force, i.e., friction, is greater than the shear force, 290 | MASS WASTING\nthen the block does not move downslope. However, if the slope angle becomes steeper or if the earth material is weak-\nened, shear force exceeds normal force, compromising shear strength, and downslope movement occurs.\nFigure 10.2: As slope increases, the force of gravity (fg) stays the same and the normal force decreases\nwhile the shear force proportionately increases.\nIn the figure, the force vectors change as the slope angle increases. The gravitational force doesn\u2019t change, but the shear\nforce increases while the normal force decreases. The steepest angle at which rock and soil material is stable and will\nnot move downslope is called the angle of repose. The angle of repose is measured relative from the horizontal. When a\nslope is at the angle of repose, the shear force is in equilibrium with the normal force. If the slope becomes just slightly\nsteeper, the shear force exceeds the normal force, and the material starts to move downhill. The angle of repose varies\nfor all material and slopes depending on many factors such as grain size, grain composition, and water content. The figure\nshows the angle of repose for sand that is poured into a pile on a flat surface. The sand grains cascade down the sides of\nthe pile until coming to rest at the angle of repose. At that angle, the base and height of the pile continue to increase, but\nthe angle of the sides remains the same.\nWater is a common factor that can significantly change the shear\nstrength of a particular slope. Water is located in pore spaces, which are\nempty air spaces in sediments or rocks between the grains. For example,\nassume a dry sand pile has an angle of repose of 30 degrees. If water is\nadded to the sand, the angle of repose will increase, possibly to 60\ndegrees or even 90 degrees, such as a sandcastle being built at a beach.\nBut if too much water is added to the pore spaces of the sandcastle, the\nwater decreases the shear strength, lowers the angle of repose, and the\nFigure 10.3: Angle of repose in a pile of sand. sandcastle collapses.\nAnother factor influencing shear strength are planes of weakness in sedimentary rocks. Bedding planes (see chapter\n5) can act as significant planes of weakness when they are parallel to the slope but less so if they are perpendicular to\nthe slope. At locations A and B, the bedding is nearly perpendicular to the slope and relatively stable. At location D, the\nbedding is nearly parallel to the slope and quite unstable. At location C, the bedding is nearly horizontal, and the stabil-\nity is intermediate between the other two extremes. Additionally, if clay minerals form along bedding planes, they can\nabsorb water and become slick. When a bedding plane of shale (clay and silt) becomes saturated, it can lower the shear\nstrength of the rock mass and cause a landslide, such as at the 1925 Gros Ventre, Wyoming rock slide. See the case stud-\nies section for details on this and other landslides. MASS WASTING | 291\nFigure 10.4: Locations A and B have bedding nearly perpendicular to the slope, making for a relatively stable\nslope. Location D has bedding nearly parallel to the slope, increasing the risk of slope failure. Location C has\nbedding nearly horizontal and the stability is relatively intermediate.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 10.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

It could\nbe rapid snowmelt, intense rainfall, earthquake shaking, volcanic eruption, storm waves, rapid-stream erosion, or human\nactivities, such as grading a new road. Increased water content within the slope is the most common mass-wasting trigger.\nWater content can increase due to rapidly melting snow or ice or an intense rain event. Intense rain events can occur more\noften during El Ni\u00f1o years. Then, the west coast of North America receives more precipitation than normal, and land-\nslides become more common. Changes in surface-water conditions resulting from earthquakes, previous slope failures\nthat dam up streams, or human structures that interfere with runoff, such as buildings, roads, or parking lots can provide\nadditional water to a slope. In the case of the 1959 Hebgen Lake rock slide, Madison Canyon, Montana, the shear strength\nof the slope may have been weakened by earthquake shaking. Most landslide mitigation diverts and drains water away\nfrom slide areas. Tarps and plastic sheeting are often used to drain water off of slide bodies and prevent infiltration into\nthe slide. Drains are used to dewater landslides and shallow wells are used to monitor the water content of some active\nlandslides.\nAn oversteepened slope may also trigger landslides. Slopes can be made excessively steep by natural processes of ero-\nsion or when humans modify the landscape for building construction. An example of how a slope may be oversteepened\nduring development occurs where the bottom of the slope is cut into, perhaps to build a road or level a building lot, and\nthe top of the slope is modified by depositing excavated material from below. If done carefully, this practice can be very\nuseful in land development, but in some cases, this can result in devastating consequences. For example, this might have\nbeen a contributing factor in the 2014 North Salt Lake City, Utah landslide. A former gravel pit was regraded to provide a 292 | MASS WASTING\nroad and several building lots. These activities may have oversteepened the slope, which resulted in a slow moving land-\nslide that destroyed one home at the bottom of the slope. Natural processes such as excessive stream erosion from a\nflood or coastal erosion during a storm can also oversteepen slopes. For example, natural undercutting of the riverbank\nwas proposed as part of the trigger for the famous 1925 Gros Ventre, Wyoming rock slide.\nSlope reinforcement can help prevent and mitigate landslides. For rockfall-prone areas, sometimes it is economical to\nuse long steel bolts. Bolts, drilled a few meters into a rock face, can secure loose pieces of material that could pose a haz-\nard. Shockcrete, a reinforced spray-on form of concrete, can strengthen a slope face when applied properly. Buttressing\na slide by adding weight at the toe of the slide and removing weight from the head of the slide, can stabilize a landslide.\nTerracing, which creates a stairstep topography, can be applied to help with slope stabilization, but it must be applied at\nthe proper scale to be effective.\nA different approach in reducing landslide hazard is to shield, catch, and divert the runout material. Sometimes the most\neconomical way to deal with a landslide hazard is to divert and slow the falling material. Special stretchable fencing can be\napplied in areas where rockfall is common to protect pedestrians and vehicles. Runout channels, diversion structures, and\ncheck dams can be used to slow debris flows and divert them around structures. Some highways have special tunnels\nthat divert landslides over the highway. In all of these cases the shielding has to be engineered to a scale that is greater\nthan the slide, or catastrophic loss in property and life could result.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 10.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The figure and table show terms used. In addition, mass-wasting types often share common morphological fea-\ntures observed on the surface, such as the head scarp\u2014commonly seen as crescent shapes on a cliff face; hummocky or\nuneven surfaces; accumulations of talus\u2014loose rocky material falling from above; and toe of slope, which covers existing\nsurface material.\n10.3.1 Types of Mass Wasting\nThe most common mass-wasting types are falls, rotational and translational slides, flows, and creep. Falls are abrupt\nrock movements that detach from steep slopes or cliffs. Rocks separate along existing natural breaks such as fractures or\nbedding planes. Movement occurs as free-falling, bouncing, and rolling. Falls are strongly influenced by gravity, mechan-\nical weathering, and water. Rotational slides commonly show slow movement along a curved rupture surface. Transla-\ntional slides often are rapid movements along a plane of distinct weakness between the overlying slide material and more\nstable underlying material. Slides can be further subdivided into rock slides, debris slides, or earth slides depending on the\ntype of the material involved (see table).

Flows are commonly separated into debris flow (coarse material) and earthflow (fine mate-\nrial) depending on the type of material involved and the amount of water. Some of the largest and fastest flows on land are\ncalled sturzstroms, or long runout landslides. They are still poorly understood, but are known to travel for long distances,\neven in places without significant atmospheres like the Moon.\nCreep is the imperceptibly slow downward movement of material caused by a regular cycle of nighttime freezing followed\nby daytime thawing in unconsolidated material such as soil. During the freeze, expansion of ice pushes soil particles out\naway from the slope, while the next day following the thaw, gravity pulls them directly downward. The net effect is a grad-\nual movement of surface soil particles downhill. Creep is indicated by curved tree trunks, bent fences or retaining walls,\ntilted poles or fences, and small soil ripples or ridges. A special type of soil creep is solifluction, which is the slow move-\nment of soil lobes on low-angle slopes due to soil seasonally freezing and thawing in high-latitude, typically sub-Arctic,\nArctic, and Antarctic locations.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Note that\nthere are many exceptions, and a landslide does not have to have these features. Displacement of material by landslides\ncauses the absence of material uphill and the deposition of new material downhill, and careful observation can iden-\ntify the evidence of that displacement. Other signs of landslides include tilted or offset structures or natural features that\nwould normally be vertical or in place.\nMany landslides have escarpments or scarps. Landslide scarps, like fault scarps, are steep terrain created when move-\nment of the adjacent land exposes a part of the subsurface. The most prominent scarp is the main scarp, which marks the\nuphill extent of the landslide. As the disturbed material moves out of place, a step slope forms and develops a new hillside\nescarpment for the undisturbed material. Main scarps are formed by movement of the displaced material away from the\nundisturbed ground and are the visible part of slide rupture surface.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/introearthscience/?p=698#h5p-69\nThe slide rupture surface is the boundary of the body of movement of the landslide. The geologic material below the slide\nsurface does not move, and is marked on the sides by the flanks of the landslide and at the end by the toe of the land-\nslide.\nThe toe of the landslide marks the end of the moving material. The toe marks the runout, or maximum distance traveled,\nof the landslide. In rotational landslides, the toe is often a large, disturbed mound of geologic material, forming as the\nlandslide moves past its original rupture surface.\nRotational and translational landslides often have extensional cracks, sag ponds, hummocky terrain and pressure ridges.\nExtensional cracks form when a landslide\u2019s toe moves forward faster than the rest of landslide, resulting in tensional\nforces. Sag ponds are small bodies of water filling depressions formed where landslide movement has impounded\ndrainage. Hummocky terrain is undulating and uneven topography that results from the ground being disturbed. Pressure\nridges develop on the margins of the landslide where material is forced upward into a ridge structure.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 10.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Large boulders dammed the Gros Ventre River and\nran up the opposite side of the valley several hundred vertical feet. The dammed river\ncreated Slide Lake, and two years later in 1927, lake levels rose high enough to destabi-\nlize the dam. The dam failed and caused a catastrophic flood that killed six people in the\nsmall downstream community of Kelly, Wyoming.\nA combination of three factors\ncaused the rock slide: 1) heavy rains\nand rapidly melting snow saturated\nthe Tensleep sandstone causing the\nunderlying shale of the Amsden For- Figure 10.6: Scar of the Gros Ventre\nlandslide in background with\nmation to lose its shear strength, 2) landslide deposits in the foreground.\nthe Gros Ventre River cut through the\nsandstone creating an oversteepened slope, and 3) soil on top of the\nmountain became saturated with water due to poor drainage.

Lastly,\nthe rockslide may have been triggered by an earthquake.\nMadison Canyon, Montana (1959): In 1959, the largest earthquake in Rocky Mountain recorded history, magnitude 7.5,\nstruck the Hebgen Lake, Montana area, causing a destructive seiche on the lake (see chapter 9). The earthquake caused a\nrock avalanche that dammed the Madison River, creating Quake Lake, and ran up the other side of the valley hundreds of\nvertical feet. Today, there are still house-sized boulders visible on the slope opposite their starting point. The slide moved\nat a velocity of up to 160.9 kph (100 mph), creating an incredible air blast that swept through the Rock Creek Campground.\nThe slide killed 28 people, most of whom were in the campground and remain buried there. In a manner like the Gros Ven-\ntre slide, foliation planes of weakness in metamorphic rock outcrops were parallel with the surface, compromising shear\nstrength.\nMount Saint Helens, Washington (1980): On May 18, 1980\na 5.1-magnitude earthquake triggered the largest land-\nslide observed in the historical record. This landslide was\nfollowed by the lateral eruption of Mount Saint Helens vol-\ncano, and the eruption was followed by volcanic debris\nflows known as lahars. The volume of material moved by\nthe landslide was 2.8 cubic kilometers (0.67 mi3).\nLa Conchita, California (1995 and 2005): On March 4, 1995,\na fast-moving earthflow damaged nine houses in the\nsouthern California coastal community of La Conchita. A\nweek later, a debris flow in the same location damaged\nfive more houses. Surface-tension cracks at the top of the\nslide gave early warning signs in the summer of 1994.

Ten years later, in 2005, a rapid-debris flow\noccurred at the end of a 15-day period of near-record rainfall in southern California. Vegetation remained relatively intact\nas it was rafted on the surface of the rapid flow, indicating that much of the landslide mass simply was being carried on a\npresumably much more saturated and fluidized layer beneath. The 2005 slide damaged 36 houses and killed 10 people.\nFigure 10.9: Oblique LIDAR image of La Conchita after the 2005 landslide.

It\nproduced a volume of material equivalent to 600 football\nfields covered in material 3 m (10 ft) deep. The winter of\n2013-2014 was unusually wet with almost double the aver-\nage amount of precipitation.

Evidence\nfor this slide includes breccia conglomerates (see chapter\n5), glassy pseudotachylytes, (see chapter 6), slip surfaces\n(similar to faults) see chapter 9), and dikes (see chapter 7).\nThe landslide is estimated to encompass an area the size\nof Rhode Island and to extend from near Cedar City, Utah\nto Panguitch, Utah. This landslide was likely the result of\nmaterial released from the side of a growing laccolith (a\ntype of igneous intrusion) see chapter 4), after being trig-\ngered by an eruption-related earthquake.\nFigure 10.13: Approximate extent of Markagunt gravity slide.\nFigure 10.14: The 1983 Thistle landslide (foreground) dammed the Spanish Fork\nriver creating a lake.\nThistle Slide (1983): Starting in April of 1983 and continuing into May of that year, a slow-moving landslide traveled 305\nm (1,000 ft) downhill and blocked Spanish Fork Canyon with an earthflow dam 61 m (200 ft) high. This caused disastrous\nflooding upstream in the Soldier Creek and Thistle Creek valleys, submerging the town of Thistle. As part of the emergency\nresponse, a spillway was constructed to prevent the newly formed lake from breaching the dam. Later, a tunnel was con-\nstructed to drain the lake, and currently the river continues to flow through this tunnel. The rail line and US-6 highway had\nto be relocated at a cost of more than $200 million. 300 | MASS WASTING\nFigure 10.15: House before and after destruction from 2013 Rockville rockfall.\nRockville Rock Fall (2013): Rockville, Utah is a small community near the entrance to Zion National Park. In December of\n2013, a 2,700 ton (1,400 yd3) block of Shinarump Conglomerate fell from the Rockville Bench cliff, landed on the steep\n35-degree slope below, and shattered into several large pieces that continued downslope at a high speed. These boulders\ncompletely destroyed a house located 375 feet below the cliff (see the before and after photographs) and killed two peo-\nple inside the home. The topographic map shows other rock falls in the area prior to this catastrophic event.\nNorth Salt Lake Slide (2014): In August 2014 after a particularly wet period, a slow moving rotational landslide destroyed\none home and damaged nearby tennis courts.\nReports from residents suggested that ground cracks had been\nseen near the top of the slope at least a year prior to the cata-\nstrophic movement. The presence of easily-drained sands and\ngravels overlying more impermeable clays weathered from vol-\ncanic ash, along with recent regrading of the slope, may have\nbeen contributing causes of this slide. Local heavy rains seem to\nhave provided the trigger. In the two years after the landslide,\nthe slope has been partially regraded to increase its stability.\nUnfortunately, in January 2017, parts of the slope have shown\nreactivation movement. Similarly, in 1996 residents in a nearby\nsubdivision started reporting distress to their homes. This dis-\ntress continued until 2012 when 18 homes became uninhabitable\ndue to extensive damage and were removed.

Mass wasting occurs\nwhen a slope is too steep to remain stable with existing material and conditions. Loose rock and soil, called regolith, are\nwhat typically move during a mass-wasting event. Slope stability is determined by two factors: the angle of the slope and\nthe shear strength of the accumulated materials. Mass-wasting events are triggered by changes that oversteepen slope\nangles and weaken slope stability, such as rapid snow melt, intense rainfall, earthquake shaking, volcanic eruption, storm\nwaves, stream erosion, and human activities. Excessive precipitation is the most common trigger. Mass-wasting events\nare classified by their type of movement and material, and they share common morphological surface features. The most\ncommon types of mass-wasting events are rockfalls, slides, flows, and creep.\nMass-wasting movement ranges from slow to dangerously rapid. Areas with steep topography and rapid rainfall, such\nas the California coast, Rocky Mountain Region, and Pacific Northwest, are particularly susceptible to hazardous mass-\nwasting events. By examining examples and lessons learned from famous mass-wasting events, scientists have a better\nunderstanding of how mass-wasting occurs. This knowledge has brought them closer to predicting where and how these\npotentially hazardous events may occur and how people can be protected.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 10 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The hydrosphere (Earth\u2019s water) is an impor-\ntant agent of geologic change. Water shapes our planet by depositing min-\nerals, aiding lithification, and altering rocks after they are lithified. Water\ncarried by subducted oceanic plates causes flux melting of upper mantle\nmaterial. Water is among the volatiles in magma and emerges at the surface\nas steam in volcanoes.\nHumans rely on suitable water\nsources for consumption, agri-\nculture, power generation, and\nmany other purposes. In pre-\nindustrial civilizations, the power- Figure 11.1: Example of a Roman aqueduct in\nSegovia, Spain.\nful controlled water resources. As\nshown in the figures, two thou-\nsand year old Roman aqueducts still grace European, Middle Eastern, and\nNorth African skylines. Ancient Mayan architecture depicts water imagery such\nFigure 11.2: Chac mask in Mexico. as frogs, water-lilies, water fowl to illustrate the importance of water in their\nsocieties. In the drier lowlands of the Yucatan Peninsula, mask facades of the\nhooked-nosed rain god, Chac (or Chaac) are prominent on Mayan buildings such as the Kodz Poop (Temple of the Masks,\nsometimes spelled Coodz Poop) at the ceremonial site of Kabah. To this day government controlled water continues to be\nan integral part of most modern societies. 306 | WATER\n11.1 Water Cycle\nFigure 11.3: The water cycle.\nThe water cycle is the continuous circulation of water in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. During circulation, water changes\nbetween solid, liquid, and gas (water vapor) and changes location. The processes involved in the water cycle are evapora-\ntion, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.\nEvaporation is the process by which a liquid is converted to a gas. Water evaporates when solar energy warms the\nwater sufficiently to excite the water molecules to the point of vaporization. Evaporation occurs from oceans, lakes, and\nstreams and the land surface. Plants contribute significant amounts of water vapor as a byproduct of photosynthesis\ncalled transpiration that occurs through the minute pores of plant leaves. The term evapotranspiration refers to these two\nsources of water entering the atmosphere and is commonly used by geologists.\nWater vapor is invisible. Condensation is the process of water vapor transitioning to a liquid. Winds carrywater vapor in\nthe atmosphere long distances. When water vapor cools or when air masses of different temperatures mix,water vapor\nmay condense back into droplets of liquid water. These water droplets usually form around a microscopic piece of\ndust or salt called condensation nuclei. Thesesmall droplets of liquid water suspended in the atmosphere becomevis-\nible as in a cloud. Water droplets inside clouds collide and stick together, growing into largerdroplets.\nOnce the water droplets become big enough, they fall to Earth as rain, snow, hail, or sleet.\nOnce precipitation has reached the Earth\u2019s surface, it can evaporate or flow as runoff into streams, lakes, and eventually\nback to the oceans. Water in streams and lakes is called surface water. Or water can also infiltrate into the soil and fill\nthe pore spaces in the rock or sediment underground to become groundwater. Groundwater slowly moves through rock\nand unconsolidated materials. Some groundwater may reach the surface again, where it discharges as springs, streams,\nlakes, and the ocean. Also, surface water in streams and lakes can infiltrate again to recharge groundwater. Therefore,\nthe surface water and groundwater systems are connected.

It is the area of land that captures precipitation and con-\ntributes runoff to a stream or stream segment. Drainage divides are local topographic\nhigh points that separate one drainage basin from another. Water that falls on one\nside of the divide goes to one stream, and water that falls on the other side of the\ndivide goes to a different stream. Each stream, tributary and streamlet has its own\ndrainage basin. In areas with flatter topography, drainage divides are not as easily\nidentified but they still exist.\nFigure 11.4: Map view of a drainage\nbasin with main trunk streams and\nmany tributaries with drainage divide in\ndashed red line. 308 | WATER\nThe headwater is where the stream begins. Smaller tribu-\ntary streams combine downhill to make the larger trunk of\nthe stream. The mouth is where the stream finally reaches\nits end. The mouth of most streams is at the ocean. How-\never, a rare number of streams do not flow to the ocean,\nbut rather end in a closed basin (or endorheic basin)\nwhere the only outlet is evaporation. Most streams in the\nGreat Basin of Western North America end in endorheic\nbasins. For example, in Salt Lake County, Utah, Little Cot-\ntonwood Creek and the Jordan River flow into the\nendorheic Great Salt Lake where the water evaporates.\nFigure 11.5: Oblique view of the drainage basin and divide of the\nLatorita River, Romania.\nFigure 11.6: Major drainage basins color coded to match the related ocean. Closed basins (or endorheic basins) are shown in gray.\nPerennial streams flow all year round. Perennial streams occur in humid or temperate climates where there is sufficient\nrainfall and low evaporation rates. Water levels rise and fall with the seasons, depending on the discharge.\nEphemeral streams flow only during rain events or the wet season. In arid climates,\nlike Utah, many streams are ephemeral. These streams occur in dry climates with low amounts of rainfall and\nhigh evaporation rates. Their channels are often dry washes or arroyos for much of the year and their sudden flow\ncauses flash floods.\nAlong Utah\u2019s Wasatch Front, the urban area extending north to south from Brigham City to Provo, there are several\nwater-sheds that are designated as \u201cwatershed protection areas\u201d that limit the type of use allowed in those drainages in\norder to protect culinary water. Dogs and swimming are limited in those watersheds because of the possibility of\ncontamination by harmful bacteria and substances to the drinking supply of Salt Lake City and surrounding municipalities. WATER | 309\nWater in the water cycle is very much like money in a personal budget. Income includes\nprecipitation and stream and groundwater inflow. Expenses include groundwater withdrawal,\nevaporation, and stream and groundwater outflow. If the expenses outweigh the income, the water budget is not\nbalanced. In this case, water is removed from savings, i.e. water storage, if available. Reservoirs, snow,\nice, soil moisture, and aquifers all serve as storage in a water budget. In dry regions, the water is critical for\nsustaining human activities. Understanding and managing the water budget is an ongoing political and social challenge.\nHydrologists create groundwater budgets within any designated area, but they are generally made for watershed\n(basin) boundaries, because groundwater and surface water are easier to account for within these boundaries. Water\nbudgets can be created for state, county, or aquifer extent boundaries as well. The groundwater budget is an essential\ncomponent of the hydrologic model; hydrologists use measured data with a conceptual workflow of the model to better\nunderstand the water system.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 11.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The state of California uses 16% of national groundwater.\nUtah is the second driest state in the United States. Nevada, having a mean statewide precipitation of 31 cm (12.2 inches)\nper year, is the driest. Utah also has the second highest per capita rate of total domestic water use of 632.16 liters (167\ngallons) per person per day. With the combination of relatively high demand and limited quantity, Utah is at risk for water\nbudget deficits. WATER | 311\nFigure 11.8: Trends in water use by source.\n11.3.1 Surface Water Distribution\nFresh water is a precious resource and should not be taken for granted, especially in dry climates. Surface water makes up\nonly 1.2% of the fresh water available on the planet, and 69% of that surface water is trapped in ground ice and permafrost.\nStream water accounts for only 0.006% of all freshwater and lakes contain only 0.26% of the world\u2019s fresh water.\nGlobal circulation patterns are the most important factor in distributing surface water through precipitation. Due to the\nCoriolis effect and the uneven heating of the Earth, air rises near the equator and near latitudes 60\u00b0 north and south. Air\nsinks at the poles and latitudes 30\u00b0 north and south (see chapter 13). Land masses near rising air are more prone to humid\nand wet climates. Land masses near sinking air, which inhibits precipitation, are prone to dry conditions. Prevailing winds,\nocean circulation patterns such as the Gulf Stream\u2019s effects on eastern North America, rain shadows (the dry leeward sides\nof mountains), and even the proximity of bodies of water can affect local climate patterns. When this moist air collides with\nthe nearby mountains causing it to rise and cool, the moisture may fall out as snow or rain on nearby areas in a phenome-\nnon known as \u201clake-effect precipitation.\u201d 312 | WATER\nFigure 11.9: Distribution of precipitation in the United States. The 100th Meridian is approximately where the average precipitation\ntransitions from relatively wet to dry. (Source: U.S. Geological Survey)\nIn the United States, the 100th meridian roughly marks the boundary between the humid and arid parts of the country.\nGrowing crops west of the 100th meridian requires irrigation. In the west, surface water is stored in reservoirs and mountain\nsnowpacks, then strategically released through a system of canals during times of high water use.\nSome of the driest parts of the western United States are in the Basin and Range Province. The Basin and Range has mul-\ntiple mountain ranges that are oriented north to south. Most of the basin valleys in the Basin and Range are dry, receiving\nless than 30 cm (12 inches) of precipitation per year. However, some of the mountain ranges can receive more than 1.52\nm (60 inches) of water as snow or snow-water-equivalent. The snow-water equivalent is the amount of water that would\nresult if the snow were melted, as the snowpack is generally much thicker than the equivalent amount of water that it\nwould produce.

In the United States,\nthe states are tasked with creating a fair and legal system for sharing water. 314 | WATER\n11.4.1 Water Rights\nBecause of the limited supply of water, especially in the western United States, states disperse a system of legal water\nrights defined as a claim to a portion or all of a water source, such as a spring, stream, well, or lake. Federal law mandates\nthat states control water rights, with the special exception of federally reserved water rights, such as those associated with\nnational parks and Native American tribes, and navigation servitude that maintains navigable water bodies. Each state in\nthe United States has a different way to disperse and manage water rights.\nA person, entity, company, or organization, must have a water right to legally extract or use surface or groundwater in\ntheir state. Water rights in some western states are dictated by the concept of prior appropriation, or \u201cfirst in time, first in\nright,\u201d where the person with the oldest water right gets priority water use during times when there is not enough water to\nfulfill every water right.\nThe Colorado River and its tributaries pass through a desert region, including seven states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,\nNew Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California), Native American reservations, and Mexico. As the western United States became\nmore populated and while California was becoming a key agricultural producer, the states along the Colorado River real-\nized that the river was important to sustaining life in the West.\nTo guarantee certain perceived water rights, these western states recognized that a water budget was necessary for the\nColorado River Basin. Thus was enacted the Colorado River Compact in 1922 to ensure that each state got a fair share of\nthe river water. The Compact granted each state a specific volume of water based on the total measured flow at the time.\nHowever, in 1922, the flow of the river was higher than its long-term average flow, consequently, more water was allocated\nto each state than is typically available in the river.\nOver the next several decades, lawmakers have made many other agreements and modifications regarding the Colorado\nRiver Compact, including those agreements that brought about the Hoover Dam (formerly Boulder Dam), and Glen\nCanyon Dam,and a treaty between the American and Mexican governments. Collectively, the agreements are referred\nto as \u201cThe Law of the River\u201d by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Despite adjustments to the Colorado River\nCompact, many believe that the Colorado River is still over-allocated, as the Colorado River flow no longer reaches the\nPacific Ocean, its original terminus (base level). Dams along the Colorado River have caused water to divert and evaporate,\ncreating serious water budget concerns in the Colorado River Basin. Predicted drought associated with global warm-\ning is causing additional concerns about over-allocating the Colorado River flow in the future.\nThe Law of the River highlights the complex and prolonged nature of interstate water rights agreements, as well as the\nimportance of water.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The Clean Water Act, an amendment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, protects navigable waters from\ndumping and point-source pollution. The Safe Drinking Water Act ensures that water that is provided by public water sup-\npliers, like cities and towns, is safe to drink.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund program ensures the cleanup of hazardous contamination, and can\nbe applied to situations of surface water and groundwater contamination. It is part of the Comprehensive Environmen-\ntal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Under this act, state governments and the U.S. Environmental Pro-\ntection Agency can use the superfund to pay for remediation of a contaminated site and then file a lawsuit against the\npolluter to recoup the costs. Or to avoid being sued, the polluter that caused the contamination may take direct action or\nprovide funds to remediatethe contamination.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 11.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Terms such as river, creek and brook are\nsocial terms not used in geology. Streams erode and transport sediments, making them the most important agents of the\nearth\u2019s surface, along with wave action (see chapter 12) in eroding and transporting sediments. They create much of the\nsurface topography and are an important water resource.\nSeveral factors cause streams to erode and transport sediment, but the two main factors are stream\u2013channel gradient\nand velocity. Stream\u2013channel gradient is the slope of thestream usually expressed in meters per kilometer or feet\nper mile. A steeper channel gradient promotes erosion. When tectonic forces elevate a mountain, the stream gradi-\nent increases, causing themountain stream to erode downward and deepen its channel eventually forming a val-\nley. Stream\u2013channel velocity is the speed at which channel water flows. Factors affecting channel velocityinclude channel\ngradient which decreases downstream, discharge and channel size which increaseas tributaries coalesce, and channel\nroughness which decreases as sediment lining the channel walls decreases in size thus reducing friction. The combined\neffect of these factors is that channel velocity actually increases from mountain brooks to the mouth of the stream.\n11.5.1 Discharge\nStream size is measured in terms of discharge, the volume of water flowing past a point in the stream over a defined time\ninterval. Volume is commonly measured in cubic units (length x width x depth), shown as feet3 (ft3) or meter3 (m3). There-\nfore, the units of discharge are cubic feet per second (ft3/sec or cfs). Therefore, the units of discharge are cubic meters per\nsecond, (m\u00b3/s or cms, or cubic feet per second (ft\u00b3/sec or cfs). Stream discharge increases downstream. Smaller streams WATER | 317\nhave less discharge than larger streams. For example, the Mississippi River is the largest river in North America, with\nan average flow of about 16,990.11 cms (600,000 cfs). For comparison, the average discharge of the Jordan River at Utah\nLake is about 16.25 cms (574 cfs) and for the annual discharge of the Amazon River, (the world\u2019s largest river), annual dis-\ncharge is about 175,565 cms (6,200,000 cfs).\nDischarge can be expressed by the following equation:\nQ = V A\n\u2022 Q = discharge cms (or ft3/sec),\n\u2022 A = cross-sectional area of the stream channel [width times average depth] as m2 (or in2 or ft2),\n\u2022 V = average channel velocity m/s (or ft/sec)\nAt a given location along the stream, velocity varies with stream width, shape, and depth within the stream channel as\nwell. When the stream channel narrows but discharge remains constant, the same volume of\nwater must flows through a narrower space causing the velocity to increase, similar to putting a thumb over the end of\na backyard water hose. In addition, during rain storms or heavy snow melt, runoff increases, which increases stream dis-\ncharge and velocity.\nWhen the stream channel curves, the highest velocity will be on the outside of the bend. When the stream channel is\nstraight and uniformly deep, the highest velocity is in the channel center at the top of the water where it is the farthest\nfrom frictional contact with the stream channel bottom and sides. In hydrology, the thalweg of a river is the line drawn that\nshows its natural progression and deepest channel, as is shown in the diagram.\nFigure 11.10: Thalweg of a river. In a river bend, the fastest moving water is on\nthe outside of the bend, near the cutbank. Stream velocity is higher on the\noutside bend and the water surface which is farthest from the friction of the\nstream bed. Longer arrows indicate faster velocity (Earle 2015).\n11.5.2 Runoff versus Infiltration\nFactors that dictate whether water will infiltrate into the ground or run off over the land include the amount, type, and\nintensity of precipitation; the type and amount of vegetation cover; the slope of the land; the temperature and aspect of\nthe land; preexisting conditions; and the type of soil in the infiltrated area. High\u2013 intensity rain will cause more runoff than\nthe same amount of rain spread out over a longer duration. If the rain falls faster than the soil\u2019s properties allow it to infil-\ntrate, then the water that cannot infiltrate becomes runoff. Dense vegetation can increase infiltration, as the vegetative\ncover slows the water particle\u2019s overland flow giving them more time to infiltrate. If a parcel of land has more direct solar\nradiation or higher seasonal temperatures, there will be less infiltration and runoff, as evapotranspiration rates will be\nhigher. As the land\u2019s slope increases, so does runoff, because the water is more inclined to move downslope than infil-\ntrate into the ground. Extreme examples are a basin and a cliff, where water infiltrates much quicker into a basin than a\ncliff that has the same soil properties. Because saturated soil does not have the capacity to take more water, runoff is gen-\nerally greater over saturated soil. Clay-rich soil cannot accept infiltration as quickly as gravel-rich soil. 318 | WATER\n11.5.3 Drainage Patterns\nThe pattern of tributaries within a region is called drainage pattern. They depend largely on the type of rock beneath, and\non structures within that rock (such as folds and faults). The main types of drainage patterns are dendritic, trellis, rec-\ntangular, radial, and deranged. Dendritic patterns are the most common and develop in areas where the underlying rock\nor sediments are uniform in character, mostly flat lying, and can be eroded equally easily in all directions. Examples are\nalluvial sediments or flat lying sedimentary rocks. Trellis patterns typically develop where sedimentary rocks have been\nfolded or tilted and then eroded to varying degrees depending on their strength. The Appalachian Mountains in eastern\nUnited States have many good examples of trellis drainage. Rectangular patterns develop in areas that have very little\ntopography and a system of bedding planes, joints, or faults that form a rectangular network. A radial pattern forms\nwhen streams flow away from a central high point such as a mountain top or volcano, with the individual streams typically\nhaving dendritic drainage patterns. In places with extensive limestone deposits, streams can disappear into the ground-\nwater via caves and subterranean drainage and this creates a deranged pattern.\nFigure 11.11: Various stream drainage patterns.\n11.5.4 Fluvial Processes\nFluvial processes dictate how a stream behaves and include factors controlling fluvial sediment production, transport,\nand deposition. Fluvial processes include velocity, slope and gradient, erosion, transportation, deposition, stream equi-\nlibrium, and base level.\nStreams can be divided into three main zones: the many smaller tributaries in the source area, the main trunk stream in\nthe floodplain and the distributaries at the mouth of the stream. Major stream systems like the Mississippi are composed\nof many source areas, many tributaries and trunk streams, all coalescing into the one main stream draining the region. The\nzones of a stream are defined as 1) the zone of sediment production (erosion), 2) the zone of transport, and 3) the zone of\ndeposition. The zone of sediment production is located in the headwaters of the stream. In the zone of sediment trans-\nport, there is a general balance between erosion of the finer sediment in its channel and transport of sediment across the\nfloodplain. Streams eventually flow into the ocean or end in quiet water with a delta which is a zone of sediment deposi-\ntion located at the mouth of a stream. The longitudinal profile of a stream is a plot of the elevation of the stream channel\nat all points along its course and illustrates the location of the three zones.\nZone of Sediment Production\nThe zone of sediment production is located in the headwaters of a stream where rills and gullies erode sediment and\ncontribute to larger tributary streams. These tributaries carry sediment and water further downstream to the main trunk\nof the stream. Tributaries at the headwaters have the steepest gradient; erosion there produces considerable sediment\ncarried b the stream. Headwater streams tend to be narrow and straight with small or non-existent floodplains adjacent\nto the channel. Since the zone of sediment production is generally the steepest part of the stream, headwaters are gen-\nerally located in relatively high elevations. The Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado west of the Continental Divide\ncontain much of the headwaters for the Colorado River which then flows from Colorado through Utah and Arizona to Mex-\nico. Headwaters of the Mississippi river system lie east of the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains and west of the\nAppalachian Divide. WATER | 319\nZone of Sediment Transport\nStreams transport sediment great distances from the\nheadwaters to the ocean, the ultimate depositional basins.\nSediment transportation is directly related to stream gra-\ndient and velocity. Faster and steeper streams can trans-\nport larger sediment grains. When velocity slows down,\nlarger sediments settle to the channel bottom. When the\nvelocity increases, those larger sediments are entrained\nand move again.\nTransported sediments are grouped into bedload, sus-\npended load, and dissolved load as illustrated in the\nabove image. Sediments moved along the channel bot- Figure 11.12: A stream carries dissolved load, suspended load, and\nbedload.\ntom are the bedload that typically consists of the largest\nand densest particles. Bedload is moved by saltation\n(bouncing) and traction (being pushed or rolled along by the force of the flow). Smaller particles are picked up by flowing\nwater and carried in suspension as suspended load. The particle size that is carried in suspended and bedload depends\non the flow velocity of the stream. Dissolved load in a stream is the total of the ions in solution from chemical weather-\ning, including such common ions such as bicarbonate (-HCO3 \u2013), calcium (Ca+2), chloride (Cl-1), potassium (K+1), and sodium\n(Na+1). The amounts of these ions are not affected by flow velocity.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Stream flooding is a\nnatural process that adds sediment to floodplains. A stream typically\nreaches its greatest velocity when it is close to flooding, known as the\nbankfull stage. As soon as the flooding stream overtops its banks\nand flows onto its floodplain, the velocity decreases. Sediment that\nwas being carried by the swiftly moving water is deposited at the\nedge of the channel, forming a low ridge or natural lev\u00e9e. In addition,\nsediments are added to the floodplain during this flooding process\ncontributing to fertile soils.\nZone of Sediment Deposition\nDeposition occurs when bedload and suspended load come to rest\non the bottom of the stream channel, lake, or ocean due to decrease\nin stream gradient and reduction in velocity. While both deposition\nand erosion occur in the zone of transport such as on point bars and\nFigure 11.13: Profile of stream channel at bankfull stage,\ncut banks, ultimate deposition where the stream reaches a lake or flood stage, and deposition of natural levee.\nocean. Landforms called deltas form where the stream enters quiet\nwater composed of the finest sediment such as fine sand, silt, and clay.\nEquilibrium and Base Level\nAll three stream zones are present in the typical longitudi-\nnal profile of a stream which plots the elevation of the\nchannel at all points along its course (see figure 11.14). All\nstreams have a long profile. The long profile shows the\nstream gradient from headwater to mouth. All streams\nattempt to achieve an energetic balance among erosion,\ntransport, gradient, velocity, discharge, and channel char-\nacteristics along the stream\u2019s profile. This balance is called\nequilibrium, a state called grade.\nAnother factor influencing equilibrium is base level, the\nelevation of the stream\u2018s mouth representing the lowest\nlevel to which a stream can erode. The ultimate base level\nis, of course, sea-level. A lake or reservoir may also repre- Figure 11.14: Example of a longitudinal profile of a stream; Halfway\nCreek, Indiana.\nsent base level for a stream entering it. The Great Basin of\nwestern Utah, Nevada, and parts of some surrounding\nstates contains no outlets to the sea and provides internal base levels for streams within it. Base level for a stream enter-\ning the ocean changes if sea-level rises or falls. Base level also changes if a natural or human-made dam is added along\na stream\u2018s profile. When base level is lowered, a stream will cut down and deepen its channel. When base level rises,\ndeposition increases as the stream adjusts attempting to establish a new state of equilibrium. A stream that has approxi-\nmately achieved equilibrium is called a graded stream.\n11.5.5 Fluvial Landforms\nStream landforms are the land features formed on the surface by either erosion or deposition. The stream-related land-\nforms described here are primarily related to channel types. WATER | 321\nChannel Types\nStream channels can be straight,\nbraided, meandering, or\nentrenched. The gradient, sedi-\nment load, discharge, and location\nof base level all influence channel\ntype. Straight channels are rela-\ntively straight, located near the\nheadwaters, have steep gradients,\nlow discharge, and narrow V-\nshaped valleys. Examples of these\nFigure 11.15: The braided Waimakariri river in are located in mountainous areas. Figure 11.16: Air photo of the meandering river,\nNew Zealand. R\u00edo Cauto, Cuba.\nBraided streams have multiple channels splitting and recombining around numerous mid-channel bars. These are found\nin floodplains with low gradients in areas with near sources of coarse sediment such as trunk streams draining mountains\nor in front of glaciers.\nMeandering streams have a single channel that curves back and forth like a snake within its floodplain where it emerges\nfrom its headwaters into the zone of transport. Meandering streams are dynamic creating a wide floodplain by eroding\nand extending meander loops side-to-side. The highest velocity water is located on the outside of a meander bend. Ero-\nsion of the outside of the curve creates a feature called a cut bank and the meander extends its loop wider by this erosion.\nThe thalweg of the stream is the deepest part of the stream channel. In\nthe straight parts of the channel, the thalweg and highest velocity are in\nthe center of the channel. But at the bend of a meandering stream, the\nthalweg shifts toward the cut bank. Opposite the cutbank on the inside\nbend of the channel is the lowest stream velocity and is an area of depo-\nsition called a point bar.\nIn areas of tectonic uplift such as on the Colorado Plateau, meandering\nstreams that once flowed on the plateau surface have become\nentrenched or incised as uplift occurred and the stream cut its meander-\ning channel down into bedrock. Over the past several million years, the\nColorado River and its tributaries have incised into the flat lying rocks of the Figure 11.17: Point bar and cut bank on the Cirque de\nla Madeleine in France.\nplateau by hundreds, even thousands of feet creating deep canyons\nincluding the Grand Canyon in Arizona. 322 | WATER\nFigure 11.18: An entrenched meander on the Colorado River in the eastern\nentrance to the Grand Canyon.\nFigure 11.19: Panoramic view of incised meanders of the San Juan River at Gooseneck State Park, Utah.\nFigure 11.20: The Rincon is an abandoned meaner loop on the entrenched Colorado\nRiver in Lake Powell. WATER | 323\nMany fluvial landforms occur on a floodplain associated\nwith a meandering stream. Meander activity and regular\nflooding contribute to widening the floodplain by eroding\nadjacent uplands. The stream channels are confined by\nnatural levees that have been built up over many years of\nregular flooding. Natural levees can isolate and direct flow\nfrom tributary channels on the floodplain from immedi-\nately reaching the main channel. These isolated streams\nare called yazoo streams and flow parallel to the main\ntrunk stream until there is an opening in the levee to allow\nfor a belated confluence.\nFigure 11.21: Landsat image of Zambezi Flood Plain, Namibia.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=persGpc6-Dw\nVideo 11.5: How is a levee formed?\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this YouTube video via the QR code.\nTo limit flooding, humans build artificial levees on flood plains. Sediment that breaches the levees during flood stage is\ncalled crevasse splays and delivers silt and clay onto the floodplain. These deposits are rich in nutrients and often make\ngood farm land. When floodwaters crest over human-made levees, the levees quickly erode with potentially catastrophic\nimpacts. Because of the good soils, farmers regularly return after floods and rebuild year after year.\nThrough erosion on the outsides of the meanders and\ndeposition on the insides, the channels of meandering\nstreams move back and forth across their floodplain over\ntime. On very broad floodplains with very low gradients, the\nmeander bends can become so extreme that they cut\nacross themselves at a narrow neck (see figure 11.22) called\na cutoff. The former channel becomes isolated and forms\nan oxbow lake seen on the right of the figure. Eventually\nthe oxbow lake fills in with sediment and becomes a wet-\nland and eventually a meander scar. Stream meanders\ncan migrate and form oxbow lakes in a relatively short\namount of time. Where stream channels form geographic\nand political boundaries, this shifting of channels can cause\nconflicts.

If wave erosion from the water body is greater than\ndeposition from the river, a delta will not form. The largest and\nmost famous delta in the United States is the Mississippi River delta\nformed where the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The\nMississippi River drainage basin is the largest in North America,\ndraining 41% of the contiguous United States. Because of the large\ndrainage area, the river carries a large amount of sediment. The\nMississippi River is a major shipping route and human engineering\nhas ensured that the channel has been artificially straightened and\nremains fixed within the floodplain. The river is now 229 km shorter\nthan it was before humans began engineering it. Because of these\nrestraints, the delta is now focused on one trunk channel and has\ncreated a \u201cbird\u2019s foot\u201d pattern.

In\nthe past 7000 years, prior to anthropogenic modifications, the Mississippi River delta formed several sequential lobes.\nThe river abandoned each lobe for a more preferred route to the Gulf of Mexico. These delta lobes were reworked by the\nocean waves of the Gulf of Mexico. After each lobe was abandoned by the river, isostatic depression and compaction of\nthe sediments caused basin subsidence and the land to sink. 326 | WATER\nA clear example of how deltas form came from an earth-\nquake. During the 1959 Madison Canyon 7.5 magnitude\nearthquake in Montana, a large landslide dammed the\nMadison River forming Quake Lake still there today. A small\ntributary stream that once flowed into the Madison River,\nnow flows into Quake Lake forming a delta composed of\ncoarse sediment actively eroded from the mountainous\nupthrown block to the north.\nDeltas can be further categorized as wave-dominated or\ntide-dominated. Wave-dominated deltas occur where the\ntides are small and wave energy dominates. An example is\nthe Nile River delta in the Mediterranean Sea that has the\nclassic shape of the Greek character (\u0394) from which the\nlandform is named. A tide-dominated delta forms when\nocean tides are powerful and influence the shape of the Figure 11.25: Delta in Quake Lake Montana. Deposition of this delta\nbegan in 1959, when the Madison river was dammed by the landslide\ndelta. For example, Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in the Bay\ncaused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.\nof Bengal (near India and Bangladesh) is the world\u2019s largest\ndelta and mangrove swamp called the Sundarban.\nAt the Sundarban Delta in Bangladesh, tidal forces create linear intru-\nsions of seawater into the delta. This delta also holds the world\u2019s\nlargest mangrove swamp.\nFigure 11.26: Sundarban Delta in Bangladesh, a\ntide-dominated delta of the Ganges River. WATER | 327\nFigure 11.27: Nile Delta showing its classic \u201cdelta\u201d shape.\nLake Bonneville was a large, pluvial lake that occupied the western\nhalf of Utah and parts of eastern Nevada from about 30,000 to\n12,000 years ago. The lake filled to a maximum elevation as great as\napproximately 5100 feet above mean sea level, filling the basins,\nleaving the mountains exposed, many as islands. The presence of\nthe lake allowed for deposition of both fine grained lake mud and\nsilt and coarse gravels from the mountains. Variations in lake level\nwere controlled by regional climate and a catastrophic failure of\nLake Bonneville\u2019s main outlet, Red Rock Pass. During extended peri-\nods of time in which the lake level remained stable, wave-cut ter-\nraces were produced that can be seen today on the flanks of many\nmountains in the region. Significant deltas formed at the mouths of\nmajor canyons in Salt Lake, Cache, and other Utah valleys. The Great\nSalt Lake is the remnant of Lake Bonneville and cities have built up\non these delta deposits.\nFigure 11.28: Map of Lake Bonneville, showing the outline of\nthe Bonneville shoreline, the highest level of the lake. 328 | WATER\nFigure 11.29: Deltaic deposits of Lake Bonneville near Logan, Utah; wave cut terraces can be seen on the mountain slope.\nStream terraces are remnants of older floodplains located above the existing floodplain and river. Like entrenched\nmeanders, stream terraces form when uplift occurs or base level drops and streams erode downward, their meanders\nwidening a new flood plain. Stream terraces can also form from extreme flood events associated with retreating glaciers.\nA classic example of multiple stream terraces are along the Snake River in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.\nFigure 11.30: Terraces along the Snake River, Wyoming.

It can be found at varying depths in all places under the ground, but is\nlimited by extractable quantity and quality.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

A good aquifer must be both porous and permeable.\nPorosity is the space between grains that can hold water, expressed as the percentage of open space in the total volume of\nthe rock. Permeabilitycomes from connectivity of the spaces that allows water to move in the aquifer. Porosity can occur\nas primary porosity, as space between sand grains or vesicles in volcanic rocks, or secondary porosity as fractures or\ndissolved spaces in rock). Compaction and cementation during lithification of sediments reduces porosity (see section\n5.3).\nA combination of a place to contain water (porosity) and the ability to move water (permeability) makes a good aquifer\u2014a\nrock unit or sediment that allows extraction of groundwater. Well-sorted sediments have higher porosity because there\nare not smaller sediment particles filling in the spaces between the larger particles. Shales made of clays generally have\nhigh porosity, but the pores are poorly connected, thereby causing low permeability. 330 | WATER\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Hydraulic conductivity measures both\nthe permeability of the porous material and the properties of the water, or whatever fluid is being transmitted like oil or\ngas. Because hydraulic conductivity also measures the properties of the fluid, such as viscosity, it is used by both petro-\nleum geologists and hydrogeologists to describe both the production capability of oil reservoirs and of aquifers.\nHigh hydraulic conductivity indicates that fluid transmits rapidly through an aquifer.\n11.6.2 Aquifers\nAquifers are rock layers with sufficient porosity and permeability to allow water to be both contained and move within\nthem. For rock or sediment to be considered an aquifer, its pores must be at least partially filled with water and it must\nbe permeable enough to transmit water. Drinking water aquifers must also contain potable water. Aquifers can vary dra-\nmatically in scale, from spanning several formations covering large regions to being a local formation in a limited area.\nAquifers adequate for water supply are both permeable, porous, and potable.\n11.6.3 Groundwater Flow\nWhen surface water infiltrates or seeps into the ground, it usually enters the\nunsaturated zone also called the vadose zone, or zone of aeration. The vadose\nzone is the volume of geologic material between the land surface and the zone\nof saturation where the pore spaces are not completely filled with water. Plant\nroots inhabit the upper vadose zone and fluid pressure in the pores is less than\natmospheric pressure. Below the vadose zone is the capillary fringe. Capillary\nfringe is the usually thin zone below the vadose zone where the pores are\ncompletely filled with water (saturation), but the fluid pressure is less than\natmospheric pressure. The pores in the capillary fringe are filled because of\ncapillary action, which occurs because of a combination of adhesion and\ncohesion. Below the capillary fringe is the saturated zone or phreatic zone, Figure 11.31: Zone of saturation.\nwhere the pores are completely saturated and the fluid in the pores is at or\nabove atmospheric pressure. The interface between the capillary fringe and the saturated zone marks the location of the\nwater table.\nWells are conduits that extend into the ground with openings to the aquifers, to extract from, measure, and sometimes\nadd water to the aquifer. Wells are generally the way that geologists and hydrologist measure the depth to groundwater\nfrom the land surface as well as withdraw water from aquifers. WATER | 331\nWater is found throughout the pore spaces in sediments and bedrock. The water table is the area below which the pores\nare fully saturated with water. The simplest case of a water table is when the aquifer is unconfined, meaning it does not\nhave a confining layer above it. Confining layers can pressurize aquifers by trapping water that is recharged at a higher\nelevation underneath the confining layer, allowing for a potentiometric surface higher than the top of the aquifer, and\nsometimes higher than the land surface.\nA confining layer is a low permeability layer above and/\nor below an aquifer that restricts the water from moving in\nand out of the aquifer. Confining layers include\naquicludes, which are so impermeable that no water trav-\nels through them, and aquitards, which significantly\ndecrease the speed at which water travels through them.\nThe potentiometric surface represents the height that\nwater would rise in a well penetrating the pressurized\naquifer system. Breaches in the pressurized aquifer sys-\ntem, like faults or wells, can cause springs or flowing\nwells, also known as artesian wells.\nThe water table will generally mirror surface topography,\nthough more subdued, because hydrostatic pressure is\nequal to atmospheric pressure along the surface of the\nwater table. If the water table intersects the ground sur-\nface the result will be water at the surface in the form of a\ngaining stream, spring, lake, or wetland. The water table\nintersects the channel for gaining streams which then\nFigure 11.32: An aquifer cross-section. This diagram shows two aquifers\ngains water from the water table. The channels for losing\nwith one aquitard (a confining or impermeable layer) between them,\nstreams lie below the water table, thus losing streams surrounded by the bedrock aquiclude, which is in contact with a gaining\nlose water to the water table. Losing streams may be sea- stream (typical in humid regions).\nsonal during a dry season or ephemeral in dry climates\nwhere they may normally be dry and carry water only after rain storms. Ephemeral streams pose a serious danger of flash\nflooding in dry climates.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Graphs of the depth to\ngroundwater over time, are known as hydrographs and show changes in the water table over time. Well\u2013water\nlevel is controlled by many factors and can change very frequently, even every minute, seasonally, and over longer peri-\nods of time. 332 | WATER\nIn 1856, French engineer Henry Darcy developed a hypothesis to show how discharge through a porous medium is con-\ntrolled by permeability, pressure, and cross\u2013sectional area. To prove this relationship, Darcy experimented withtubes of\npacked sediment with water running through them. The results of his experiments empirically established a quantitative\nmeasure of hydraulic conductivity and discharge that is known as Darcy\u2019s law. The relationships described by Darcy\u2019s\nLaw have close similarities to Fourier\u2019s law in the field of heat conduction, Ohm\u2019s law in the field of electrical networks, or\nFick\u2019s law in diffusion theory.\nQ=KA(\u0394h/L)\n\u2022 Q = flow (volume/time)\n\u2022 K = hydraulic conductivity (length/time)\n\u2022 A = cross-sectional area of flow (area)\n\u2022 \u0394h = change in pressure head (pressure difference)\n\u2022 L = distance between pressure (h) measurements\n(length)\n\u2022 \u0394h/L is commonly referred to as the hydraulic gradi-\nent\nPumping water from an unconfined aquifer lowers Figure 11.33: Pipe showing apparatus that would demonstrate Darcy\u2019s\nthe water table. Pumping water from a confined aquifer Law. \u0394h would be measured across L from a to b.\nlowers the pressure and/or potentiometric sur-\nface around the well. In an unconfined aquifer, the water table is lowered as water is removed from the aquifer near the\nwell producing drawdown and a cone of depression (see figure 11.34). In a confined aquifer, pumping on an artesian well\nreduces the pressure or potentiometric surface around the well.\nWhen one cone of depression intersects another cone of\ndepression or a barrier feature like an impermeable moun-\ntain block, drawdown is intensified. When a cone of\ndepression intersects a recharge zone, the cone of\ndepression is lessened.\n11.6.4 Recharge\nThe recharge area is where surface water enters an\naquifer through the process of infiltration. Recharge areas\nare generally topographically high locations of an aquifer.\nThey are characterized by losing streams and permeable\nrock that allows infiltration into the aquifer. Recharge\nareas mark the beginning of groundwater flow paths.\nFigure 11.34: Cones of depression.\nIn the Basin and Range Province,\nrecharge areas for the unconsolidated aquifers of the valleys are along mountain foothills. In the foothills of Salt Lake Val-\nley, losing streams contribute water to the gravel-rich deltaic deposits of ancient Lake Bonneville, in some cases feeding\nartesian wells in the Salt Lake Valley.\nAn aquifer management practice is to induce rechargethrough storage and recovery. Geologists and hydrolo-\ngists can increase the recharge rate into an aquifer system using injection wells and infiltration galleries or basins. Injec-\ntion wells pump water into an aquifer where it can be stored. Injection wells are regulated by state and federal\ngovernments to ensure that the injected water is not negatively impacting the quality or supply of the existing groundwater\nin the aquifer. Some aquifers can store significant quantities of water, allowing water managers to use the aquifer system WATER | 333\nlike a surface reservoir. Water is stored in the aquifer during periods of low water demand and high water supply and later\nextracted during times of high water demand and low water supply.\nFigure 11.35: Different ways an aquifer can be recharged.\n11.6.5 Discharge\nDischarge areas are where the water table or potentiometric surface intersects the land surface. Discharge areas mark\nthe end of groundwater flow paths. These areas are characterized by springs, flowing (artesian) wells, gaining streams,\nand playas in the dry valley basins of the Basin and Range Province of the western United States.\n11.6.6 Groundwater Mining and Subsidence\nLike other natural resources on our planet, the quantity of fresh and potable water is finite. The only natural source of\nwater on land is from the sky in the form of precipitation. In many places, groundwater is being extracted faster than it\nis being replenished. When groundwater is extracted faster than it is recharged, groundwater levels and potentiometric\nsurfaces decline, and discharge areas diminish or dry up completely. Regional pumping-induced groundwater decline is\nknown as groundwater mining or groundwater overdraft. Groundwater mining is a serious situation and can lead to dry\nwells, reduced spring and stream flow, and subsidence. Groundwater mining is happeningis places where more water\nis extracted by pumping than is being replenished by precipitation, and the water table is continually lowered. In these\nsituations, groundwater must be viewed as a ore body and in its depletion, the possibility of producing ghost towns.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

This pressure is called pore pressure and comes from the weight of overly-\ning water. If pore pressure decreases because of groundwater mining, the aquifer can compact,\ncausing the surface of the ground to sink. Areas especially susceptible to this effect\nare aquifers made of unconsolidated sediments. Unconsolidated sediments with multiple layers\nof clay and other fine-grained material are at higher risk because when water is drained, clay com-\npactsconsiderably.\nSubsidence from groundwater mining has been documented in southwestern Utah, notably Cedar\nValley, Iron County, Utah. Groundwater levels have declined more than 100 feet in certain parts of\nCedar Valley, causing earth fissures and measurable amounts of land subsidence.\nThis photo shows documentation of subsidence from pumping of groundwater for irrigation in the\nCentral Valley in California. The pole shows subsidence from groundwater pumping over a period\nof time.\nFigure 11.36: Evidence\nof land subsidence from\npumping of\ngroundwater shown by\ndates on a pole.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 11.6 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

As water runs over the land or infiltrates into the ground, it dissolves material left behind by these potential con-\ntaminant sources. There are three major groups of contamination: organic and inorganic chemicals and biological agents.\nSmall sediments that cloud water, causing turbidity, is also an issue with some wells, but it is not considered contamina-\ntion. The risks and type of remediation for a contaminant depends on the type of chemicals present.\nContamination occurs as point\u2013source and nonpoint\u2013source pollution. Point source pollution can be attributed to a single,\ndefinable source, while nonpoint source pollution is from multiple dispersed sources. Point sources include waste dis-\nposal sites, storage tanks, sewage treatment plants, and chemical spills. Nonpoint sources are dispersed and indiscreet,\nwhere the whole of the contribution of pollutants is harmful, but the individual components do not have harmful concen- WATER | 335\ntrations of pollutants. A good example of nonpoint pollution is residential areas, where lawn fertilizer on one person\u2019s yard\nmay not contribute much pollution to the system, but the combined effect of many residents using fertilizer can lead to\nsignificant nonpoint pollution. Other nonpoint sources include nutrients (nitrate and phosphate), herbicides, pesticides con-\ntributed by farming, nitrate contributed by animal operations, and nitrate contributed by septic systems.\nOrganic chemicals are common pollutants. They consist of strands and rings of carbon atoms, usually connected by cova-\nlent bonds. Other types of atoms, like chlorine, and molecules, like hydroxide (OH\u2013), are attached to the strands and rings.\nThe number and arrangement of atoms will decide how the chemical behaves in the environment, its danger to humans\nor ecosystems, and where the chemical ends up in the environment. The different arrangements of carbon allow for tens\nof thousands of organic chemicals, many of which have never been studied for negative effects on human health or the\nenvironment. Common organic pollutants are herbicides and pesticides, pharmaceuticals, fuel, and industrial solvents and\ncleansers.\nOrganic chemicals include surfactants such as cleaning agents and synthetic hormones associated with pharmaceuticals,\nwhich can act as endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors mimic hormones, and can cause long-term effects in devel-\noping sexual reproduction systems in developing animals. Only very small quantities of endocrine disruptors are needed\nto cause significant changes in animal populations.\nAn example of organic chemical contamination is the Love Canal, Niagara Falls, New York. From 1942 to 1952, the Hooker\nChemical Company disposed of over 21,337 mt (21,000 t) of chemical waste, including chlorinated hydrocarbons, into a\ncanal and covered it with a thin layer of clay. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are a large group of organic chemicals that have\nchlorine functional groups, most of which are toxic and carcinogenic to humans. The company sold the land to the New\nYork School Board, who developed it into a neighborhood. After residents began to suffer from serious health ailments and\npools of oily fluid started rising into residents\u2019 basements, the neighborhood had to be evacuated. This site became a U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Superfund site, a site with federal funding and oversight to ensure its cleanup.\nInorganic chemicals are another set of chemical pollutants. They can contain carbon atoms, but not in long strands or links.\nInorganic contaminants include chloride, arsenic, and nitrate (NO3). Nutrients can be from geologic material, like phospho-\nrous-rich rock, but are most often sourced from fertilizer and animal and human waste. Untreated sewage and agricultural\nrunoff contain concentrates of nitrogen and phosphorus which are essential for the growth of microorganisms. Nutrients\nlike nitrate and phosphate in surface water can promote growth of microbes, like blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), which\nin turn use oxygen and create toxins (microcystins and anatoxins) in lakes. This process is known as eutrophication.\nMetals are common inorganic contaminants. Lead, mercury, and arsenic are some of the more problematic inorganic\ngroundwater contaminants. Bangladesh has a well documented case of arsenic contamination from natural geologic\nmaterial dissolving into the groundwater. Acid\u2013mine drainage can also cause significant inorganic contamination (see\nchapter 16).\nSalt, typically sodium chloride, is a common inorganic contaminant. It can be introduced into groundwater from natural\nsources, such as evaporite deposits like the Arapien Shale of Utah, or from anthropogenic sources like the salts applied to\nroads in the winter to keep ice from forming. Salt contamination can also occur near ocean coasts from saltwater intruding\ninto the cones of depression around fresh groundwater pumping, inducing the encroachment of saltwater into the fresh-\nwater body.\nBiological agents are another common groundwater contaminant which includes harmful bacteria and viruses. A com-\nmon bacteria contaminant is Escherichia coli (E. coli). Generally, harmful bacteria are not present in groundwater unless\nthe groundwater source is closely connected with a contaminated surface source, such as a septic system. Karst, land-\nforms created from dissolved limestone, is especially susceptible to this form of contamination, because water moves\nrelatively quickly through theconduits of dissolved limestone. Bacteria can also be used for remediation.\nView USGS tables on contaminants found in groundwater. 336 | WATER\nRemediation is the act of cleaning contamination. Hydrologists use three types of remediation: biological, chemical, and\nphysical. Biological remediation uses specific strains of bacteria to break down a contaminant into safer chemicals. This\ntype of remediation is usually used on organic chemicals, but also works on reducing or oxidizing inorganic chemicals like\nnitrate. Phytoremediation is a type of bioremediation that uses plants to absorb the chemicals over time.\nChemical remediation uses chemicals to remove the contaminant or make it less harmful. One example is to use a reactive\nbarrier, a permeable wall in the ground or at a discharge point that chemically reacts with contaminants in the water. Reac-\ntive barriers made of limestone can increase the pH of acid mine drainage, making the water less acidic and more basic,\nwhich removes dissolved contaminants by precipitation into solid form.\nPhysical remediation consists of removing the contaminated water and either treating it with filtration,\ncalled pump\u2013and\u2013treat, or disposing of it. All of these options are technically complex, expensive, and difficult, with physi-\ncal remediation typically being the most costly.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 11.7 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Karst can be found\nanywhere there is limestone and other soluble subter-\nranean substances like salt deposits. Dissolving of lime-\nstone creates features like sinkholes, caverns,\ndisappearing streams, and towers.\nFigure 11.37: Steep karst towers in China left as remnants as limestone is\ndissolved away by acidic rain and groundwater. WATER | 337\nFigure 11.38: Sinkholes of the McCauley Sink in Northern Arizona, produced by\ncollapse of Kaibab Limestone into caverns caused by solution of underlying\nsalt deposits.\nDissolving of underlying salt deposits has caused sinkholes to form in the Kaibab Limestone on the Colorado Plateau in\nArizona.\nFigure 11.39: This sinkhole from collapse of surface into a underground cavern appeared in the\nfront yard of this home in Florida.\nCollapse of the surface into an underground cavern caused this sinkhole in the front yard of a home in Florida.\nCO2 in the atmosphere dissolves readily in the water droplets that form clouds from which precipitation comes in the\nform of rain and snow. This precipitation is slightly acidic with carbonic acid. Karst forms when carbonic acid dis-\nsolves calcite (calcium carbonate) in limestone.\nH2O + CO2 = H2CO3\nWater + Carbon Dioxide Gas equals Carbonic Acid in Water\nCaCO3 + H2CO3 = Ca2++ 2HCO3 -1\nSolid Calcite + Carbonic Acid in Water Dissolved equals Calcium Ion + Dissolved Bicarbonate Ion 338 | WATER\nAfter the slightly acidic water dissolves the calcite,\nchanges in temperature or gas content in the water can\ncause the water to redeposit the calcite in a different place\nas tufa (travertine), often deposited by a spring or in a\ncave. Speleothems are secondary deposits, typically made\nof travertine, deposited in a cave. Travertine speleothems\nform by water dripping through cracks and dissolved\nopenings in caves and evaporating, leaving behind the\ntravertine deposits. Speleothems commonly occur in the\nform of stalactites, when extending from the ceiling, and\nstalagmites, when standing up from the floor.\nFigure 11.40: Mammoth hot springs, Yellowstone National Park.\nFigure 11.41: Varieties of speleotherms.\nSurface water enters the karst system through sinkholes,\nlosing streams, and disappearing streams. Changes in\nbase level can cause rivers running over limestone to dis-\nsolve the limestone and sink into the ground. As the water\ncontinues to dissolve its way through the limestone, it can\nleave behind intricate networks of caves and narrow pas-\nsages. Often dissolution will follow and expand fractures\nin the limestone. Water exits the karst system as springs\nand rises. In mountainous terrane, dissolution can extend\nall the way through the vertical profile of the mountain, with\ncaverns dropping thousands of feet.\nFigure 11.42: This stream disappears into a subterranean cavern system\nto re-emerge a few hundred yards downstream.

It continuously cycles through the atmosphere, over land, and through the ground. In\nmuch of the United States and other countries, water is managed through a system of regional laws and regulations and\ndistributed on paper in a system collectively known as \u201cwater rights\u201d. Surface water follows a watershed, which is sepa-\nrate from other areas by its divides (highest ridges). Groundwater exists in the pores within rocks and sediment. It moves\npredominantly due to pressure and gravitational gradients through the rock. Human and natural causes can make water\nunsuitable for consumption.

Coastlines are the interfaces between, and as such, the longest visible\nboundaries on Earth. To understand the processes that occur at these boundaries, it is important to first understand wave\nenergy.\n12.1 Waves and Wave Processes\nFigure 12.1: Particle motion within a wind-blown wave. COASTLINES | 345\nWind blowing over the surface of water transfers energy to the water through friction. The energy transferred from wind to\nwater causes waves to form. Waves move as individual oscillating particles of water. As the wave crest passes, the water\nis moving forward. As the wave trough passes, the water is moving backward. To see wave movement in action, watch a\ncork or some floating object as a wave passes.\nImportant terms to understand in the operation of waves\ninclude: the wave crest is the highest point of the wave; the\ntrough is the lowest point of the wave. Wave height is the\nvertical distance from the trough to the crest and is deter-\nmined by wave energy. Wave amplitude is half the wave\nheight, or the distance from either the crest or trough to\nthe still water line. Wavelength is the horizontal distance\nbetween consecutive wave crests. Wave velocity is the\nspeed at which a wave crest moves forward and is related\nto the wave\u2019s energy. Wave period is the time interval it\nFigure 12.2: Aspects of water waves, labeled.\ntakes for adjacent wave crests to pass a given point.\nThe circular motion of water particles diminishes with depth\nand is negligible at about one-half wavelength, an impor-\ntant dimension to remember in connection with waves.\nWave base is the vertical depth at which water ceases to be\ndisturbed by waves. In water shallower than wave base,\nwaves will disturb the bottom and ripple shore sand. Wave\nbase is measured at a depth of about one-half wavelength,\nwhere the water particles\u2019 circular motion diminishes to zero.\nIf waves approaching a beach have crests at about 6 m (~20\nft) intervals, this wave motion disturbs water to about 3 m\n(~10 ft) deep. This motion is known as fair-weather wave\nbase. In strong storms such as hurricanes, both wavelength\nand wave base increase dramatically to a depth known as\nstorm wave base, which is approximately 91 m (~300 ft).\nFigure 12.3: Diagram describing wavebase.\nWaves are generated by wind blowing across the ocean sur-\nface. The amount of energy imparted to the water depends on wind velocity and the distance across which the wind is\nblowing. This distance is called fetch. Waves striking a shore are typically generated by storms hundreds of miles from the\ncoast and have been traveling across the ocean for days.\nWinds blowing in a relatively constant direction generate waves moving in that\ndirection. Such a group of approximately parallel waves traveling together is called\na wave train. A wave train coming from one fetch can produce various wave-\nlengths. Longer wavelengths travel at a faster velocity than shorter wavelengths, so\nthey arrive first at a distant shore. Thus, there is a wavelength\u2013sorting process that\ntakes place during the wave train\u2019s travel. This sorting process is called wave dis-\npersion.\nFigure 12.4: Wave train moving with\ndispersion. 346 | COASTLINES\n12.1.1 Behavior of Waves Approaching Shore\nOn the open sea, waves generally appear choppy because wave trains from many direc-\ntions are interacting with each other, a process called wave interference. Constructive inter-\nference occurs where crests align with other crests. The aligned wave height is the sum of\nthe individual wave heights, a process referred to as wave amplification. Constructive inter-\nference also produces hollows where troughs align with other troughs. Destructive interfer-\nence occurs where crests align with troughs and cancel each other out. As waves approach\nshore and begin to make frictional contact with the sea floor at a depth of about one-half\nwavelength or less, they begin to slow down. However, the energy carried by the wave\nremains the same, so the waves build up higher. Remember that water moves in a circular\nmotion as a wave passes, and each circle is fed from the trough in front of the advancing\nwave. As the wave encounters shallower water at the shore, there is eventually insufficient\nwater in the trough in front of the wave to supply a complete circle, so the crest pours over\nFigure 12.5: Types of breakers. creating a breaker.\nA special type of wave is called a tsunami, sometimes incorrectly called a \u201ctidal\nwave.\u201d Tsunamis are generated by energetic events affecting the sea floor, such\nas earthquakes, submarine landslides, and volcanic eruptions (see chapter 9\nand chapter 4). During earthquakes for example, tsunamis can be produced\nwhen the moving crustal rocks below the sea abruptly elevate a portion of the\nseafloor. Water is suddenly lifted creating a bulge at the surface and a wave train\nspreads out in all directions traveling at tremendous speeds [over 322 kph (200\nFigure 12.6: All waves, like tsunamis, slow\nmph)] and carrying enormous energy. Tsunamis may pass unnoticed in the open down as they reach shallow water. This\nocean because they move so fast, the wavelength is very long, and the wave causes the wave to increase in hight.\nheight is very low. But, as the wave train approaches shore and each wave\nbegins to interact with the shallow seafloor, friction increases and the wave slows down. Still carrying its enormous energy,\nwave height builds up and the wave strikes the shore as a wall of water that can be over 30 m (~100 ft) high. The massive\nwave, called a tsunami runup, may sweep inland well beyond the beach destroying structures far inland. Tsunamis can\ndeliver a catastrophic blow to people at the beach. As the trough water in front of the tsunami wave is drawn back, the\nseafloor is exposed. Curious and unsuspecting people on the beach may run out to see exposed offshore sea life only to\nbe overwhelmed when the breaking crest hits.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 12.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

They include all parts of the land-sea boundary directly affected by the sea, including land far\nabove high tide and seafloor well below normal wave base. But, the shoreline itself is the direct interface between water\nand land that shifts with the tides. This shifting interface at the shoreline is called the littoral zone. The combination of\nwaves, currents, climate, coastal morphology, and gravity, all act on this land-sea boundary to create shoreline features.\n12.2.1 Shoreline Zones\nFigure 12.7: Diagram of zones of the shoreline.\nShorelines are divided into five primary zones\u2014offshore, nearshore, surf, foreshore, and backshore. The offshore zone is\nbelow water, but it is still geologically active due to flows of turbidity currents that cascade over the continental slope\nand accumulate in the continental rise. The nearshore zone is the area of the shore affected by the waves where water\ndepth is one-half wavelength or less. The width of this zone depends on the maximum wavelength of the approaching\nwave train and the slope of the seafloor. The nearshore zone includes the shoreface, which is where sand is disturbed and\ndeposited. The shoreface is broken into two segments: upper and lower shoreface. Upper shoreface is affected by every-\nday wave action and consists of finely-laminated and cross-bedded sand. The lower shoreface is the only area moved by\nstorm waves and consists of hummocky cross-stratified sand. The surf zone is where the waves break.\nThe foreshore zone overlaps the surf zone and is periodically wet and dry due to waves and tides. The foreshore zone\nis where planer-laminated, well-sorted sand accumulates. The beach face is the part of the foreshore zone where the\nbreaking waves swash up and the backwash flows back down. Low ridges above the beach face in the foreshore zone\nare called berms. During the summer in North America, when most people visit the beach, the zone where people spread\ntheir towels and beach umbrellas is the summer berm. Wave energy is typically lower in the summer, which allows sand\nto pile onto the beach. Behind the summer berm is a low ridge of sand called the winter berm. In winter, higher storm\nenergy moves the summer berm sand off the beach and piles it in the nearshore zone. The next year, that sand is replaced\non the beach and moved back onto the summer berm. The backshore zone is the area always above sea level in normal\nconditions. In the backshore zone, onshore winds may blow sand behind the beach and the berms, creating dunes. 348 | COASTLINES\n12.2.2 Refraction, Longshore Currents, and Longshore Drift\nAs waves enter shallower water less than one-half wavelength depth, they slow down.\nWaves usually approach the shoreline at an angle, with the end of the waves nearest\nthe beach slowing down first. This causes the wave crests to bend, called wave refrac-\ntion. From the beach face, this causes it to look like waves are approaching the beach\nstraight on, parallel to the beach. However, as refracted waves actually approach the\nshoreline at a slight angle, they create a slight difference between the swash as it\nmoves up the beach face at a slight angle and the backwash as it flows straight back\ndown under gravity. This slight angle between swash and backwash along the beach\ncreates a current called the longshore current. Waves stir up sand in the surf zone and\nmove it along the shore. This movement of sand is called longshore drift. Longshore\ndrift along both the west and east coasts of North America moves sand north to south\non average.\nLongshore currents can carry\nlongshore drift down a coast\nuntil it reaches a bay or inlet\nwhere it will deposit sand in the\nFigure 12.8: Longshore drift. 1=beach,\nquieter water (see chapter 11). 2=sea, 3=longshore current direction,\nHere, a spit can form.

Where\nthe bay or inlet serves as boat anchorage, spits and baymouth bars\nare a severe inconvenience. Often, inconvenienced communities\ncreate methods to keep their bays and harbors open.\nOne way to keep a har-\nFigure 12.9: Farewell Spit, New Zealand.\nbor open is to build a\njetty, a long concrete or stone barrier constructed to deflect the sand away\nfrom a harbor mouth or other ocean waterway. If the jetty does not deflect the\nsand far enough out, sand may continue to flow along the shore, forming a\nspit around the end of the jetty. A more expensive but effective method to\nkeep a bay mouth open is to dredge the sand from the growing spit, put it on\nbarges, and deliver it back to the drift downstream of the harbor mouth. An\neven more expensive but more effective option is to install large pumps and\nFigure 12.10: Jetties near Carlsbad, California.\npipes to draw in the sand upstream of the harbor, pump it through pipes, and\nNotice the left jetty is loaded with sand, while\ndischarge it back into the drift downstream of the harbor mouth. Because nat- the right jetty is lacking sand. This is due to the\nlongshore drift going left to right.\nural processes work continuously, human efforts to mitigate inconvenient spits\nand baymouth bars require ongoing modifications. For example, the commu-\nnity of Santa Barbara, California, tried several methods to keep their harbor open before settling on pumps and piping. COASTLINES | 349\nRip currents are another coastal phenomenon related to longshore currents. Rip cur-\nrents occur in the nearshore seafloor when wave trains come straight onto the shore-\nline. In areas where wave trains push water directly toward the beach face or where\nthe shape of the nearshore seafloor refracts waves toward a specific point on the\nbeach, the water piles up on shore. But this water must find an outlet back to the sea.\nThe outlet is relatively narrow, and rip currents carry the water directly away from the\nbeach. Swimmers caught in rip currents are carried out to sea. Swimming back to\nshore directly against the strong current is fruitless. A solution for good swimmers is\nto ride out the current to where it dissipates, swim around it, and return to the beach.\nAnother solution for average swimmers is to swim parallel to the beach until out of the\ncurrent, then return to the beach. Where rip currents are known to exist, warning signs\nFigure 12.11: Animation of rip currents. are often posted. The best solution is to understand the nature of rip currents, have a\nplan before entering the water, or watch the signs and avoid them all together.\nLike rip currents, undertow is a current that moves away from the shore. However, unlike rip currents, undertow occurs\nunderneath the approaching waves and is strongest in the surf zone where waves are high and water is shallow. Undertow\nis another return flow for water transported onshore by waves.\n12.2.3 Emergent and Submergent Coasts\nFigure 12.12: Island Arch, a sea arch in Victoria, Australia.\nEmergent coasts occur where sea levels fall relative to land level. Submergent coasts occur where sea levels rise relative\nto land level. Tectonic shifts and sea level changes cause the long-term rise and fall of sea level relative to land. Some\nfeatures associated with emergent coasts include high cliffs, headlands, exposed bedrock, steep slopes, rocky shores,\narches, stacks, tombolos, wave-cut platforms, and wave notches.\nIn emergent coasts, wave energy, wind, and gravity erode the coast-\nline. The erosional features are elevated relative to the wave zone. Sea\ncliffs are persistent features as waves cut away at their base and higher\nrocks calve off by mass wasting. Refracted waves that attack bedrock\nat the base of headlands may erode or carve out a sea arch, which can\nextend below sea level in a sea cave. When a sea arch collapses, it\nleaves one or more rock columns called stacks.\nFigure 12.13: This tombolo, called \u201cAngel Road,\u201d connects\nthe stack of Shodo Island, Japan. 350 | COASTLINES\nA stack or near shore island creates a quiet water zone\nbehind it. Sand moving in the longshore drift accumulates\nin this quiet zone forming a tombolo: a sand strip that con-\nnects the island or stack to the shoreline. Where sand\nsupply is low, wave energy may erode a wave-cut plat-\nform across the surf zone, exposed as bare rock with tidal\npools at low tide. This bench-like terrace extends to the\nFigure 12.14: Wave notches carved by Lake Bonneville, Antelope Island, cliff\u2019s base. When wave energy cuts into the base of a sea\nUtah. cliff, it creates a wave notch.\nSubmergent coasts occur where sea levels rise relative to\nland. This may be due to tectonic subsidence\u2014when the\nEarth\u2019s crust sinks\u2014or when sea levels rise due to glacier\nmelt. Features associated with submergent coasts include\nflooded river mouths, fjords, barrier islands, lagoons,\nestuaries, bays, tidal flats, and tidal currents. In submer-\ngent coastlines, river mouths are flooded by the rising\nwater, for example Chesapeake Bay. Fjords are glacial val-\nleys flooded by post-ice age sea level rise (see chapter 14).\nBarrier islands are elongated bodies of sand that formed\nfrom old beach sands that used to parallel the shoreline.\nOften, lagoons lie behind barrier islands. Barrier island\nformation is controversial: some scientists believe that\nthey formed when ice sheets melted after the last ice age,\nraising sea levels. Another hypothesis is that barrier\nFigure 12.15: Landsat image of Chesapeake Bay, eastern United States.\nislands formed from spits and bars accumulating far off- Note the barrier islands parallel to the coastline.\nshore.\nTidal flats\u2014or mudflats, form where tides alternately flood\nand expose low areas along the coast. Tidal currents cre-\nate combinations of symmetrical and asymmetrical ripple\nmarks on mudflats, and drying mud creates mud cracks. In\nthe central Wasatch Mountains of Utah, ancient tidal flat\ndeposits are exposed in the Precambrian strata of the Big\nCottonwood Formation. These ancient deposits provide an\nexample of applying Hutton\u2019s principle of uniformitarian-\nism (see chapter 1). Sedimentary structures common on\nmodern tidal flats indicate that these ancient deposits\nwere formed in a similar environment: there were shore-\nlines, tides, and shoreline processes acting at that time, yet\nthe ancient age indicates that there were no land plants to\nhold products of mechanical weathering in place (see\nFigure 12.16: General diagram of a tidal flat and associated features. chapter 5), so erosion rates would have been different.\nGeologically, tidal flats are broken into three different sections: barren zones, marshes, and salt pans. These zones may\nbe present or absent in each individual tidal flat. Barren zones are areas with strong flowing water, coarser sediment, with\nripple marks and cross bedding common. Marshes are vegetated with sand and mud. Salt pans or flats, less often sub-\nmerged than the other zones, are the finest-grained parts of tidal flats, with silty sediment and mud cracks (see chapter\n5). COASTLINES | 351\nLagoons are locations where spits, barrier islands, or other features\npartially cut off a body of water from the ocean. Estuaries are a vege-\ntated type of lagoon where fresh water flows into the area making the\nwater brackish\u2014a salinity between salt and fresh water. However,\nterms like lagoon, estuary, and even bay are often loosely used in\nplace of one another. Lagoons and estuaries are certainly transitional\nbetween land and water environments where littoral, shallow shore-\nlines; lacustrine, lakes or lagoons; and fluvial, rivers or currents can\noverlap. For more information on lagoons and estuaries, see chapter\n5.\n12.2.4 Human Impact on Coastal Beaches\nHumans impact coastal\nbeaches when they\nbuild homes, condo-\nminiums, hotels, busi- Figure 12.17: Kara-Bogaz Gol lagoon, Turkmenistan.\nnesses, and\nharbors\u2014and then again when they try to manage the natural processes of\nerosion. Waves, currents, longshore drift, and dams at river mouths deplete\nsand from expensive beachfront property and expose once calm harbors to\nhigh-wave energy. To protect their investment, keep sand on their beach, and\nmaintain calm harbors, cities and landowners find ways to mitigate the dam-\nage by building jetties, groins, dams, and breakwaters.\nFigure 12.18: Groins gathering sediment from\nlongshore drift. Jetties are large manmade piles of\nboulders or concrete barriers built\nat river mouths and harbors. A jetty is designed to divert the current or tide, to\nkeep a channel to the ocean open, and to protect a harbor or beach from wave\naction. Groins are similar but smaller than jetties. Groins are fences of wire,\nwood or concrete built across the beach perpendicular to the shoreline and\ndownstream of a property. Unlike jetties, groins are used to preserve sand on a\nbeach rather than to divert it. Sand erodes on the downstream side of the groin\nand collects against the upstream side. Every groin on one property thus cre-\nates a need for another one on the property downstream. A series of groins\nalong a beach develops a scalloped appearance along the shoreline.\nInland streams and rivers flow to the ocean carrying sand to the longshore cur-\nrent which distributes it to beaches. When dams are built, they trap sand and\nkeep sediment from reaching beaches. To replenish beaches, sand may be\nhauled in from other areas by trucks or barges and dumped on the depleted\nbeach. Unfortunately, this can disrupt the ecosystem that exists along the shore- Figure 12.19: Groin system on a coast in\nVirginia.\nline by exposing native creatures to foreign ecosystems and microorganisms\nand by introducing foreign objects to humans. For example, visitors to one\nreplenished east coast beach found munitions and metal shards in the sand, which had been dredged from abandoned\nmilitary test ranges. 352 | COASTLINES\nAn approach to protect harbors and moorings from high-energy wave\naction is to build a breakwater\u2014an offshore structure against which the\nwaves break, leaving calmer waters behind it. Unfortunately, breakwaters\nkeep waves from reaching the beach and stop sand moving with long-\nshore drift. When longshore drift is interrupted, sand is deposited in qui-\neter water, and the shoreline builds out forming a tombolo behind the\nbreakwater. The tombolo eventually fill in behind the breakwater with\nsand. When the city of Venice, California built a breakwater to create a\nquiet water harbor, longshore drift created a tombolo behind the break-\nwater, as seen in the image. The tombolo now acts as a large groin in the\nbeach drift.\n12.2.5 Submarine Canyons\nSubmarine canyons\nare narrow, deep\nunderwater canyons Figure 12.20: A tombolo formed behind the\nlocated on continen- breakwater at Venice, CA.\ntal shelves. Subma-\nrine canyons typically form at the mouths of large landward river\nsystems. They form when rivers cut down into the continental shelf\nduring low sea level and when material continually slumps or flows\ndown from the mouth of a river or a delta. Underwater currents rich in\nsediment and more dense than sea water, can flow down the canyons,\neven erode and deepen them, then drain onto the ocean floor. Under-\nFigure 12.21: Submarine canyons off of Los Angeles. water landslides, called turbidity flows, occur when steep delta faces\nA=San Gabriel Canyon, B=Newport Canyon.

Turbidity flows in submarine canyons can continue to erode the\ncanyon, and eventually, fan-shaped deposits develop at the mouth of\nthe canyon on the continental rise. See chapter 5 for more information on turbidity flows.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 12.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Ocean currents are driven by persistent global winds blowing over the\nwater\u2019s surface and by water density. Ocean currents are part of Earth\u2019s heat engine in which solar energy is absorbed by\nocean water and distributed by ocean currents. Water has another unique property, high specific heat, that relates to ocean\ncurrents. Specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to raise a unit volume of a substance one degree. For water it takes\none calorie per cubic centimeter to raise its temperature one degree Celsius. This means the oceans, covering 71% of the\nEarth\u2019s surface, soak up solar heat with little temperature change and distribute that heat around the Earth by ocean cur-\nrents.\nFigure 12.22: World ocean currents.\n12.3.1 Surface Currents\nThe Earth\u2019s rotation and the Coriolis effect exert significant influence on ocean currents (see chapter 13). In the figure, the\nblack arrows show global surface currents. Notice the large circular currents in the northern and southern hemispheres\nin the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These currents are called gyres and are driven by atmospheric circulation\u2014air\nmovement. Gyres rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere because\nof the Coriolis Effect. Western boundary currents flow from the equator toward the poles carrying warm water. They are\nkey contributors to local climate. Western boundary currents are narrow and move poleward along the east coasts of adja-\ncent continents. The Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio currents in the northern hemisphere and the Brazil, Mozambique, and\nAustralian currents in the southern hemisphere are western boundary currents. Currents returning cold water toward the\nequator are broad and diffuse along the western coasts of adjacent land masses. These warm western boundary and cold\neastern boundary currents affect climate of nearby lands making them warmer or colder than other areas at equivalent\nlatitudes. For example, the warm Gulf Stream makes Northern Europe much milder than similar latitudes in northeastern\nCanada and Greenland. Another example is the cool Humboldt Current, also called the Peru Current, flowing north along\nthe west coast of South America. Cold currents limit evaporation in the ocean, which is one reason the Atacama Desert in\nChile is cool and arid. 354 | COASTLINES\n12.3.2 Deep Currents\nWhether an ocean current moves horizontally or vertically\ndepends on its density. The density of seawater is deter-\nmined by temperature and salinity.\nEvaporation and freshwater influx from rivers affect salinity\nand, therefore, the density of seawater. As the western\nboundary currents cool at high latitudes and salinity\nincreases due to evaporation and ice formation (recall that\nice floats; water is densest just above its freezing point). So\nthe cold, denser water sinks to become the ocean\u2019s deep\nwaters. Deep-water movement is called thermohaline cir-\nculation\u2014thermo refers to temperature, and haline refers\nto salinity. This circulation connects the world\u2019s deep ocean\nFigure 12.23: Global thermohaline circulation. PSS=practical salinity units.\nwaters. Movement of the Gulf Stream illustrates the begin-\nning of thermohaline circulation. Heat in the warm pole-\nward moving Gulf Stream promotes evaporation which takes heat from the water and as heat thus dissipates, the water\ncools. The resulting water is much colder, saltier, and denser. As the denser water reaches the North Atlantic and Green-\nland, it begins to sink and becomes a deep-water current. As shown in the illustration above, this worldwide connection\nbetween shallow and deep-ocean circulation overturns and mixes the entire world ocean, bringing nutrients to marine life,\nand is sometimes referred to as the global conveyor belt.\n12.3.3 Tides\nTides are the rising and lowering of sea level during the day and are caused by the gravitational effects of the Sun and\nMoon on the oceans. The Earth rotates daily within the Moon and Sun\u2019s gravity fields. Although the Sun is much larger\nand its gravitational pull is more powerful, the Moon is closer to Earth; hence, the Moon\u2019s gravitational influence on tides is\ndominant. The magnitude of the tide at a given location and the difference between high and low tide\u2014the tidal range,\ndepends primarily on the configuration of the Moon and Sun with respect to the Earth orbit and rotation. Spring tide occurs\nwhen the Sun, Moon, and Earth line up with each other at the full or new Moon, and the tidal range is at a maximum. Neap\ntide occurs approximately two weeks later when the Moon and Sun are at right angles with the Earth, and the tidal range\nis lowest.\nFigure 12.24: The types of tides. COASTLINES | 355\nThe Earth rotates within a tidal envelope, so tides rise and ebb daily.\nTides are measured at coastal locations. These measurements and\nthe tidal predictions based on them are published on the NOAA web-\nsite. Tides rising and falling create tidal patterns at any given shore\nlocation. The three types of tidal patterns are diurnal, semidiurnal, and\nmixed.\nFigure 12.25: Different tide types.\nFigure 12.26: Global tide types. 356 | COASTLINES\nDiurnal tides go through one complete cycle each tidal\nday. A tidal day is the amount of time for the Moon to align\nwith a point on the Earth as the Earth rotates, which is\nslightly longer than 24 hours. Semidiurnal tides go through\ntwo complete cycles in each tidal day\u2014approximately 12\nhours and 50 minutes, with the tidal range typically varying\nin each cycle. Mixed tides are a combination of diurnal and\nsemidiurnal patterns and show two tidal cycles per tidal\nday, but the relative amplitudes of each cycle and their\nhighs and lows vary during the tidal month. For example,\nthere is a high, high tide and a high, low tide. The next day,\nthere is a low, high tide and a low, low tide. Forecasting the\ntidal pattern and the times tidal phases arrive at a given\nshore location\nis complicated and can be done for only a few days at a\ntime. Tidal phases are determined by bathymetry: the depth\nof ocean basins and the continental obstacles that are in\nthe way of the tidal envelope within which the Earth rotates.\nLocal tidal experts make 48-hour tidal forecasts using tidal\ncharts based on daily observations, as can be seen in the\nFigure 12.27: A tidal day lasts slightly longer than 24 hours.\nchart of different tide types. A typical tidal range is approx-\nimately 1 m (3 ft). Extreme tidal ranges occur where the tidal\nwave enters a narrow restrictive zone that funnels the tidal energy. An example is the English Channel between Great\nBritain and the European continent where the tidal range is 7 to 9.75 m (23 to 32 ft). The Earth\u2019s highest tidal ranges occur\nat the Bay of Fundy, the funnel-like bay between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada, where the average range is\nnearly 12 m (40 ft) and the extreme range is around 18 m (60 ft). At extreme tidal range locations, a person who ventures\nout onto the seafloor exposed during ebb tide may not be able to outrun the advancing water during flood tide. NOAA has\nadditional information on tides.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 12.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Waves, currents, and tides are the\nmain agents that shape shorelines. Most coastal landforms can be attributed to moving sand via longshore drift, and long-\nterm rising or falling sea levels. COASTLINES | 357\nThe shoreline is the interface between water and land and is divided into five zones. Processes at the shoreline are\ncalled littoral processes. Waves approach the beach at an angle, which cause the waves to bend towards the beach. This\nbending action is called wave refraction and is responsible for creating the longshore current and longshore drift\u2014the\nprocess that moves sand along the coasts. When the longshore current deposits sand along the coast into quieter waters,\nthe sand can accumulate, creating a spit or barrier called a baymouth bar, which often blocks bays and harbors. Inconve-\nnienced humans create methods to keep their harbors open and preserve sand on their beaches by creating jetties and\ngroins, which negatively affect natural beach processes.\nEmergent coasts are created by sea levels falling, while submergent coasts are caused by sea levels rising. Oceans\nabsorb solar energy, which is distributed by currents throughout the world. Circular surface currents, called gyres, rotate\nclockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Thermohaline deep circulation\nconnects the world\u2019s deep ocean waters: when shallow poleward moving warm water evaporates, the colder, saltier, and\ndenser water sinks and becomes deep-water currents. The connection between shallow and deep-ocean circulation is\ncalled the global conveyor belt.\nTides are the rising and lowering of sea level during the day and are caused by the gravitational effects of the Sun and\nMoon on the oceans. There are three types of tidal patterns: diurnal, semidiurnal, and mixed. Typical tidal ranges are\napproximately 1 m (3 ft). Extreme tidal ranges are around 18 m (60 ft).\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 12 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

While temperature extremes are often\nassociated with deserts, they do not define them. Deserts\nexhibit extreme temperatures because of the lack of mois-\nture in the atmosphere, including low humidity and scarce\ncloud cover. Without cloud cover, the Earth\u2019s surface\nabsorbs more of the Sun\u2019s energy during the day and emits\nmore heat at night.\nFigure 13.1: World hot deserts (BWh indicated in red).\nDeserts are not randomly located on the Earth\u2019s surface.\nMany deserts are located at latitudes between 15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0\nin both hemispheres and at both the North and South\nPoles, created by prevailing wind circulation in the atmos-\nphere. Sinking, dry air currents occurring at 30\u00b0 north and\nsouth of the equator produce trade winds that create\ndeserts like the African Sahara and Australian Outback.\nFigure 13.2: Mountainous areas in front of the prevailing winds create a\nrain shadow. DESERTS | 361\nAnother type of desert is found in the rain shadow created from\nprevailing winds blowing over mountain ranges. As the wind dri-\nves air up and over mountains, atmospheric moisture is released\nas snow or rain. Atmospheric pressure is lower at higher eleva-\ntions, causing the moisture-laden air to cool. Cool air holds less\nmoisture than hot air, and precipitation occurs as the wind rises\nup the mountain. After releasing its moisture on the windward\nside of the mountains, the dry air descends on the leeward or\ndownwind side of the mountains to create an arid region with lit-\ntle precipitation called a rain shadow. Examples of rain-shadow\ndeserts include the Western Interior Desert of North America\nand Atacama Desert of Chile, which is the Earth\u2019s driest, warm\ndesert.\nFinally, polar deserts, such as vast areas of the Antarctic and\nArctic, are created from sinking cold air that is too cold to hold\nmuch moisture. Although they are covered with ice and snow,\nthese deserts have very low average annual precipitation. As a\nresult, Antarctica is Earth\u2019s driest continent.

Solar energy\nconverted to heat is the engine that drives the circulation of air in the atmosphere and water in the oceans. The strength\nof the circulation is determined by how much energy is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface, which in turn is dependent on the\naverage position of the Sun relative to the Earth. In other words, the Earth is heated unevenly depending on latitude and\nangle of incidence. Latitude is a line circling the Earth parallel to the equator and is measured in degrees. The equator is\n0\u00b0 and the North and South Poles are 90\u00b0 N and 90\u00b0 S respectively (see the diagram of generalized atmospheric circula-\ntion on Earth). Angle of incidence is the angle made by a ray of sunlight shining on the Earth\u2019s surface. Tropical zones are\nlocated near the equator, where the latitude and angle of incidence are close to 0\u00b0, and receive high amounts of solar\nenergy. The poles, which have latitudes and angles of incidence approaching 90\u00b0, receive little or almost no energy. 362 | DESERTS\nFigure 13.4: Generalized atmospheric circulation.\nThe figure shows the generalized air circulation within the atmosphere. Three cells of circulating air span the space\nbetween the equator and poles in both hemispheres, the Hadley Cell, the Ferrel or Midlatitude Cell, and the Polar Cell.\nIn the Hadley Cell located over the tropics and closest to the equatorial belt, the sun heats the air and causes it to rise.\nThe rising air cools and releases its contained moisture as tropical rain. The rising dried air spreads away from the equator\nand toward the north and south poles, where it collides with dry air in the Ferrel Cell. The combined dry air sinks back to\nthe Earth at 30\u00b0 latitude. This sinking drier air creates belts of predominantly high pressure at approximately 30\u00b0 north and\nsouth of the equator, called the horse latitudes. Arid zones between 15o and 30o north and south of the equator thus exist\nwithin which desert conditions predominate. The descending air flowing north and south in the Hadley and Ferrel cells also\ncreates prevailing winds called trade winds near the equator, and westerlies in the temperate zone. Note the arrows indi-\ncating general directions of winds in these zones. DESERTS | 363\nOther deserts, like the Great Basin Desert that covers parts of Utah\nand Nevada, owe at least part of their origin to other atmospheric phe-\nnomena. The Great Basin Desert, while somewhat affected by sinking\nair effects from global circulation, is a rain-shadow desert. As westerly\nmoist air from the Pacific rises over the Sierra Nevada and other\nmountains, it cools and loses moisture as condensation and precipi-\ntation on the upwind or rainy side of the mountains.\nOne of the driest places on Earth is\nthe Atacama Desert of northern\nChile. The Atacama Desert occu-\npies a strip of land along Chile\u2019s\ncoast just north of latitude 30\u00b0S, at\nthe southern edge of the trade-wind\nbelt. The desert lies west of the\nFigure 13.5: USGS Map of the Great Basin Desert.\nAndes Mountains, in the rain shadow\ncreated by prevailing trade winds blowing west. As this warm moist air crossing the Ama-\nzon basin meets the eastern edge of the mountains, it rises, cools, and precipitates much\nof its water out as rain. Once over the mountains, the cool, dry air descends onto the Ata-\ncama desert. Onshore winds from the Pacific are cooled by the Peru (Humboldt) ocean\ncurrent. This super-cooled air holds almost no moisture and, with these three factors,\nsome locations in the Atacama Desert have received no measured precipitation for sev-\nFigure 13.6: Map of the Atacama\ndesert (yellow) and surrounding eral years. This desert is the driest, non-polar location on Earth.\nrelated climate areas (orange).\nNotice in the figure that the polar regions are\nalso areas of predominantly high pressure created by descending cold dry air,\nthe Polar Cells. As with the other cells, cold air, which holds much less mois-\nture than warm air, descends to create polar deserts. This is why historically,\nland near the north and south poles has always been so dry.\n13.1.2 Coriolis Effect\nThe Earth rotates toward the\neast where the sun rises. Think\nof spinning a weight on a string\naround your head. The speed of\nthe weight depends on the\nlength of the string.

This factor causes deflection of movements\nthat occur in north-south directions. 364 | DESERTS\nAnother factor in the Coriolis effect also causes deflection of east-west\nmovement due to the angle between the centripetal effect of Earth\u2019s\nspin and gravity pulling toward the earth\u2019s center (see figure 13.9). This\nproduces a net deflection toward the equator. The total Coriolis deflec-\ntion on a mass moving in any direction on the rotating Earth results from\na combination of these two factors.\nSince each hemisphere has three atmospheric cells moving respec-\ntively north and south relative to the Earth beneath them, the Coriolis\neffect deflects these moving air masses to the right in the Northern\nHemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis\neffect also deflects moving masses of water in the ocean currents.\nFigure 13.9: Forces acting on a mass moving East\u2013West\nFor example, in the northern hemisphere Hadley Cell, the lower alti- on the rotating Earth that produce the Coriolis Effect.\ntude air currents are flowing south towards the equator. These are\ndeflected to the right (or west) by the Coriolis effect. This deflected air generates the prevailing trade winds that European\nsailors used to cross the Atlantic Ocean and reach South America and the Caribbean Islands in their tall ships. This air\nmovement is mirrored in the Hadley Cell in the southern hemisphere; the lower altitude air current flowing equatorward is\ndeflected to the left, creating trade winds that blow to the northwest.\nIn the northern Mid-Latitude or Ferrel Cell, surface air currents flow from the horse\nlatitudes (latitude 30\u00b0) toward the North Pole, and the Coriolis effect deflects them\ntoward the east, or to the right, producing the zone of westerly winds. In the south-\nern hemisphere Mid-Latitude or Ferrel Cell, the poleward flowing surface air is\ndeflected to the left and flows southeast creating the Southern Hemisphere west-\nerlies.\nAnother Coriolis-generated deflection produces the Polar Cells. At 60o north and\nsouth latitude, relatively warmer rising air flows poleward cooling and converging\nat the poles where it sinks in the polar high. This sinking dry air creates the polar\ndeserts, the driest deserts on Earth. Persistence of ice and snow is a result of cold\ntemperatures at these dry locations.\nFigure 13.10: Inertia of air masses caused by\nthe Coriolis Effect in the absence of other\nforces. DESERTS | 365\nFigure 13.11: Gyres of the Earth\u2019s oceans.\nThe Coriolis effect operates on all motions on the Earth. Artillerymen must take the Coriolis effect into account on ballistic\ntrajectories when making long-distance targeting calculations. Geologists note how its effect on air and oceanic currents\ncreates deserts in designated zones around the Earth as well as the surface currents in the ocean. The Coriolis effect\ncauses the ocean gyres to turn clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern. It also affects\nweather by creating high-altitude, polar jet streams that sometimes push lobes of cold arctic air into the temperate zone,\ndown to as far as latitude 30\u00b0 from the usual 60\u00b0. It also causes low pressure systems and intense tropical storms to rotate\ncounter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

While higher\ntemperatures typically spur faster chemical weathering,\nwater is the main agent of weathering, and lack of water\nslows both mechanical and chemical weathering. Low\nprecipitation levels also mean less runoff as well as ice\nwedging. When precipitation does occur in the desert, it\nis often heavy and may result in flash floods in which a lot\nof material may be dislodged and moved quickly.\nFigure 13.12: Weathering and erosion of Canyonlands National Park has\ncreated a unique landscape, including arches, cliffs, and spires.\nOne unique weathering product in deserts is desert varnish.\nAlso known as desert patina or rock rust, this is thin dark brown\nlayers of clay minerals and iron and manganese oxides that\nform on very stable surfaces within arid environments. The\nexact way this material forms is still unknown, though cosmo-\ngenic and biologic mechanisms have been proposed.\nFigure 13.13: Newspaper rock, near Canyonlands National Park, has\nmany petroglyphs carved into desert varnish. DESERTS | 367\nWhile water is still the dominant agent of erosion in most\ndesert environments, wind is a notable agent of weather-\ning and erosion in many deserts. This includes suspended\nsediment traveling in haboobs, or large dust storms, that\nfrequent deserts. Deposits of windblown dust are called\nloess. Loess deposits cover wide areas of the midwestern\nUnited States, much of it from rock flour that melted out of\nthe ice sheets during the last ice age. Loess was also\nblown from desert regions in the West. Possessing lower\nenergy than water, wind transport nevertheless moves\nsand, silt, and dust. As noted in chapter 11, the load carried\nby a fluid (air is a fluid like water) is distributed among bed-\nload and suspended load. As with water, in wind these\ncomponents depend on wind velocity.\nFigure 13.14: A dust storm (haboob) hits Texas in 2019.\nFigure 13.15: Diagram showing the mechanics of\nsaltation.\nSand size material moves by a process called saltation in which sand grains\nare lifted into the moving air and carried a short distance where they drop\nand splash into the surface dislodging other sand grains which are then car-\nried a short distance and splash dislodging still others.\nSince saltating sand grains are constantly impacting other sand grains, wind\nblown sand grains are commonly quite well rounded with frosted surfaces.\nSaltation is a cascading effect of sand movement creating a zone of wind\nblown sand up to a meter or so above the ground. This zone of saltating sand\nis a powerful erosive agent in which bedrock features are effectively sand-\nblasted. The fine-grained suspended load is effectively sorted from the sand\nFigure 13.16: Enlarged image of frosted and near the surface carrying the silt and dust into haboobs. Wind is thus an\nrounded windblown sand grains. effective sorting agent separating sand and dust sized (\u226470 \u00b5m) particles\n(see chapter 5). When wind velocity is high enough to slide or roll materials\nalong the surface, the process is called creep. 368 | DESERTS\nOne extreme version of sediment movement was shrouded in mystery for\nyears: Sliding stones. Also called sailing stones and sliding rocks, these\nare large moving boulders along flat surfaces in deserts, leaving trails. This\nincludes the famous example of the Racetrack Playa in Death Valley\nNational Park, California. For years, scientists and enthusiasts attempted to\nexplain their movement, with little definitive results. In recent years, several\nexperimental and observational studies have confirmed that the stones,\nimbedded in thin layers of ice, are propelled by friction from high winds.\nThese studies include measurements of actual movement, as well as re-\ncreations of the conditions, with resulting movement in the lab.\nThe zone of saltating sand is an\neffective agent of erosion\nthrough sand abrasion. A\nbedrock outcrop which has such\na sandblasted shape is called a\nFigure 13.17: A \u201csailing stone\u201d at Racetrack Playa in\nyardang. Rocks and boulders\nDeath Valley National Park, California.\nlying on the surface may be\nblasted and polished by saltating sand. When predominant wind directions shift,\nmultiple sandblasted and polished faces may appear. Such wind abraded\ndesert rocks are called ventifacts.\nFigure 13.18: Wind-carved ventifact in White\nDesert National Park, Egypt.\nFigure 13.19: A yardang near Meadow, Texas.\nIn places with sand and silt accumulations, clumps of vegetation\noften anchor sediment on the desert surface. Yet, winds may be\nsufficient to remove materials not anchored by vegetation. The\nbowl-shaped depression remaining on the surface is called a\nblowout.\nFigure 13.20: Blowout in Texas.

When the stream emerges\nfrom the narrow canyon, the flow is no longer constrained\nby the canyon walls and spreads out. At the lower slope\nangle, the water slows down and drops its coarser load. As\nthe channel fills with this conglomeratic material, the\nstream is deflected around it. This deposited material\ndeflects the stream into a system of radial distributary\nchannels in a process similar to how a delta is made by\na river entering a body of water. This process develops a\nFigure 13.21: Aerial image of alluvial fan in Death Valley.\nsystem of radial distributaries and constructs a fan shaped\nfeature called an alluvial fan.\nAlluvial fans continue to grow and may eventually coalesce with\nneighboring fans to form an apron of alluvium along the moun-\ntain front called a bajada.\nAs the mountains erode away and their sediment accumulates\nfirst in alluvial fans, then bajadas, the mountains eventually are\nburied in their own erosional debris. Such buried mountain rem-\nnants are called inselbergs, \u201cisland mountains,\u201d as first described\nby the German geologist Wilhelm Bornhardt (1864\u20131946).\nFigure 13.22: Bajada along Frisco Peak in Utah. 370 | DESERTS\nFigure 13.23: Inselbergs in the Western Sahara.\nWhere the desert valley is an enclosed basin, i.e. streams entering it do not\ndrain out, the water is removed by evaporation and a dry lake bed is formed\ncalled a playa.\nPlayas are among the\nflattest of all landforms.\nSuch a dry lake bed may\ncover a large area and\nbe filled after a heavy\nthunderstorm to only a\nfew inches deep. Playa\nlakes and desert\nFigure 13.24: Satellite image of desert playa\nstreams that contain surrounded by mountains.\nFigure 13.25: Dry wash (or ephemeral stream). water only after rain-\nstorms are called intermittent or ephemeral. Because of intense thun-\nderstorms, the volume of water transported by ephemeral drainage in arid environments can be substantial during a short\nperiod of time. Desert soil structures lack organic matter that promotes infiltration by absorbing water. Instead of percolat-\ning into the soil, the runoff compacts the ground surface, making the soil hydrophobic or water-repellant. Because of this\nhardpan surface, ephemeral streams may gather water across large areas, suddenly filling with water from storms many\nmiles away.\nHigh-volume ephemeral flows, called flash floods, may move as\nsheet flows or sheetwash, as well as be channeled through nor-\nmally dry arroyos or canyons. Flash floods are a major factor in\ndesert deposition. Dry channels can fill quickly with ephemeral\ndrainage, creating a mass of water and debris that charges\ndown the arroyo, and even overflowing the banks. Flash floods\npose a serious hazard for desert travelers because the storm activ-\nity feeding the runoff may be miles away. People hiking or camp-\ning in arroyos that have been bone dry for months, or years, have\nbeen swept away by sudden flash floods.\nFigure 13.26: Flash flood in a dry wash. DESERTS | 371\n13.3.1 Sand\nThe popular concept of a typical desert is a broad expanse\nof sand. Geologically, deserts are defined by a lack of water and\narid regions resembling a sea of sand belong to the category of\ndesert called an erg. An erg consists of fine-grained,\nloose sand grains, often blown by wind, or aeo-\nlian forces, into dunes. Probably the best known erg is the Rub\u2019\nal Khali, which means Empty Quarter, of the Arabian Penin-\nsula. Ergs are also found in the Great Sand Dunes National\nPark (Colorado), Little Sahara Recreation Area (Utah), White\nSands National Monument (New Mexico), and parts of Death Val-\nley National Park (California). Ergs are not restricted to deserts,\nbut may form anywhere there is a substantial supply of sand,\nincluding as far north as 60\u00b0 N in Saskatchewan, Canada, in\nthe Athabasca Sand Dunes Provincial Park. Coastal ergs exist\nFigure 13.27: Sahara Desert, a sand sea or erg.\nalong lakes and oceans as well, and examples are found in Ore-\ngon, Michigan, and Indiana.\nFigure 13.28: Formation of cross bedding in sand dunes.\nAn internal cross section of a sand dune shows a feature called cross bedding. As wind blows up the windward side of\nthe dune, it carries sand to the dune crest depositing layers of sand parallel to the windward (or \u201cstoss\u201d) side. The sand\nbuilds up the crest of the dune and pours over the top until the leeward (downwind or slip) face of the dune reaches the\nangle of repose, the maximum angle which will support the slip face. Dunes are unstable features and move as the sand\nerodes from the stoss side and continues to drop down the leeward side covering previous stoss and slip-face layers and\ncreating the cross beds. Mostly, these are reworked over and over again, but occasionally, the features are preserved in\na depression, then lithified. Shifting wind directions and abundant sand sources create chaotic patterns of cross beds like\nthose seen in Zion National Park of Utah. 372 | DESERTS\nIn the Mesozoic Era, Utah was covered by a series\nof ergs, with the thickest being in Southern Utah, which lithified\ninto sandstone (see chapter 5). Perhaps the best known of\nthese sandstone formations is the Navajo Sandstone of Juras-\nsic age. This sandstone formation consists of dramatic cliffs and\nspires in Zion National Park and covers a large part of the Col-\norado Plateau. In Arches National Park, a later series of\nsand dunes covered the Navajo Sandstone and lithified to\nbecome the Entrada Formation also during the Jurassic. Erosion\nof overlying layers exposed fins of the underlying Entrada Sand-\nstone and carved out weaker parts of the fins forming the arches.\nAs the cements that\nFigure 13.29: Cross beds in the Navajo Sandstone at Zion\nNational Park. hold the grains\ntogether in these\nmodern sand cliffs disintegrate and the freed grains gather at the base of the\ncliffs and move down the washes, sand grains may be recycled and rede-\nposited. These Mesozoic sand ergs may represent ancient quartz sands recy-\ncled many times from igneous origins in the early Precambrian, just passing\nnow through another cycle of erosion and deposition. An example of this is\nCoral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in Southwestern Utah, which contains sand\nthat is being eroded from the Navajo Sandstone to form new dunes.\nFigure 13.30: Enlarged image of frosted and\nrounded windblown sand grains.\nDune Types\nDunes are complex features formed by a combination of wind direction\nand sand supply, in some cases interacting with vegetation. There are\nseveral types of dunes representing variables of wind direction, sand\nsupply and vegetative anchoring. Barchan dunes or crescent dunes\nform where sand supply is limited and there is a fairly constant wind\ndirection. Barchans move downwind and develop a crescent shape with\nwings on either side of a dune crest. Barchans are known to actually\nmove over homes, even towns.\nFigure 13.31: NASA image of barchan dune field in coastal\nBrazil. DESERTS | 373\nFigure 13.32: Satellite image of longitudinal dunes in Egypt.\nLongitudinal dunes or linear dunes form where sand supply is greater and the wind blows around a dominant direction,\nin a back-and-forth manner. They may form ridges tens of meters high lined up with the predominant wind directions.\nParabolic dunes form where vegetation anchors parts of\nthe sand and unanchored parts blowout. Parabolic dune\nshape may be similar to barchan dunes but usually\nreversed, and it is determined more by the anchoring veg-\netation than a strict parabolic form.\nStar dunes form where the wind direction is variable in all\ndirections. Sand supply can range from limited to quite\nabundant. It is the variation in wind direction that forms the\nstar.\nFigure 13.33: Parabolic dunes.\nFigure 13.34: Star dune in Namib Desert. 374 | DESERTS\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 13.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

It\ncovers western Utah, most of Nevada, and extends into\nsoutheastern California, southern Oregon, and southern\nIdaho. Because there is not outlet to the ocean, streams in\nthe Great Basin deliver runoff to lakes and playas within\nthe basin. A subregion within the Great Basin is the Basin\nand Range which extends from the Wasatch Front in Utah\nwest across Nevada to the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Cal-\nifornia. The basins and ranges referred to in the name\nare horsts and grabens, formed by normal fault blocks\nfrom crustal extension, as discussed in chapter 2 and\nchapter 9. The lithosphere of the entire area has stretched\nby a factor of about 2, meaning from end to end, the dis-\ntance has doubled over the past 30 million years or so. Val-\nleys without outlets form individual basins, each of which is\nfilled with alluvial sediments leading into playa deposi-\ntional environments. During the recent Ice Age, The cli-\nmate was more humid and while glaciers were forming in\nsome of the mountains, pluvial lakes formed covering\nlarge areas (see section 14.4.3). During the Ice Age, valleys\nFigure 13.35: The Great Basin.\nin much of western Utah and eastern Nevada were cov-\nered by Lake Bonneville. As the climate became arid after the Ice Age, Lake Bonneville dried leaving as a remnant the\nGreat Salt Lake in Utah. DESERTS | 375\nThe desert of the Basin and Range extends from about 35\u00b0\nto near 40\u00b0 and results from a rain shadow effect created by\nwesterly winds from the Pacific rising and cooling over the\nSierras becoming depleted of moisture by precipitation on\nthe western side. The result is relatively dry air descending\nacross Nevada and western Utah.\nA journey from the Wasatch Front southwest to the Pacific\nOcean will show stages of desert landscape evolution from\nthe fault block mountains of Utah with sharp peaks and\nalluvial fans at the mouths of canyons, through land-\nscapes in Southern Nevada with bajadas along the moun-\ntain fronts, to the landscapes in the Mojave Desert of\nCalifornia with subdued inselbergs sticking up through a\nFigure 13.36: Typical Basin and Range scene. Ridgecrest, CA sits just\neast of the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. sea of coalesced bajadas. These landscapes illustrate the\nevolutionary stages of desert landscape development.\n13.4.1 Desertification\nFigure 13.37: World map showing desertification vulnerability.\nWhen previously arable land suitable for agriculture transforms into desert, this process is called desertification. Plants\nand humus-rich soil (see chapter 5) promote groundwater infiltration and water retention. When an area becomes more\narid due to changing environmental conditions, the plants and soil become less effective in retaining water, creating a pos-\nitive feedback loop of desertification. This self-reinforcing loop spirals into increasingly arid conditions and further\nenlarges the desert regions. 376 | DESERTS\nDesertification may be caused by human activities, such as unsustainable crop cultivation practices, overgrazing by live-\nstock, overuse of groundwater, and global climate change. Human-caused desertification is a serious worldwide prob-\nlem. The world map figure above shows what areas are most vulnerable to desertification. Note the red and orange\nareas in the western and midwestern regions of the United States, which also cover large areas of arable land used\nfor raising food crops and animals. The creation of the Dust Bowl in the 1930s (see chapter 5) is a classic example of a\nhigh-vulnerability region impacted by human\u2013caused desertification. As demonstrated in the Dust Bowl, conflicts may\narise between agricultural practices and conservation measures. Mitigating desertification while allowing farmers to make\na survivable living requires public and individual education to create community support and understanding of sustainable\nagriculture alternatives.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 13.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The arid belts between 15o and 30o north and south latitudes are produced by descending air masses associ-\nated with major cells in the atmosphere and include the major deserts like the Sahara in Africa and the Middle East. Rain\nshadow deserts lie behind mountain ranges or long land expanses in zones of prevailing winds like the deserts of western\nNorth America, the Atacama of South America, and the Gobi of Asia. Dry descending air also creates the polar deserts at\nthe poles.\nMajor atmospheric circulation involves the Hadley cells, midlatitude or Ferrel cells, and the polar cells in each hemi-\nsphere. Warmed and rising air in the Hadley cells rains back on the tropics and moves toward the poles as dryer air. That\nair meets the dryer equatorward moving air of the Ferrel cells. This dry air descends in the arid zones, called the horse\nlatitudes, to produce the arid belts in each hemisphere. Rotation of the Earth creates the Coriolis Effect that deflects these\nmoving air masses to produce zones of prevailing winds, the Trade Winds in the subtropics and the Westerlies in the\nmidlatitudes. A combination of latitude, rain shadow, and cold adjacent ocean currents causes the Atacama Desert of\nnorthern Chile, the driest desert on Earth.\nWeathering in deserts takes place just as in other climes only slower because of less water. Desert varnish is a weather-\ning product unique to desert environments. As in more humid climes, water is the main agent of erosion although wind is a\nnotable agent. Large dust storms called haboobs transport large amounts of sediment that may accumulate in sand seas\ncalled ergs or finer grained loess deposits. Sand transport occurs mainly by saltation in which grain to grain impact causes\nfrosting of grain surfaces. Sandblasting by persistent winds produces stones with polished surfaces called ventifacts and\nsculpted bedrock features called yardangs. DESERTS | 377\nLandforms produced in desert environments include alluvial fans, bajadas, inselbergs, and playas. Windblown sand can\naccumulate as dunes. The forms of dunes, like barchans, parabolic, longitudinal, and star dunes, relate to the abundance\nof sand supply and wind direction as well as presence of vegetation. The internal structure of dunes shows cross bedding.\nFossil dunes in an ancient desert leave cross bedding in places like Zion and Arches national parks in Utah showing shift-\ning wind directions in these ancient environments. Ephemeral streams in desert regions may carry water only after storms\nand pose risk of flash floods.\nThe Great Basin of North America is an enclosed basin with no drainage to the ocean. The only exit for precipitation there\nis by evaporation. Travels in the Great Basin show stages of development of desert landscapes from playas and alluvial\nfans, to bajadas, to inselbergs which are eroded mountains buried in their own erosional debris.\nPoor land management can result in dying vegetation and loss of soil moisture producing an accelerating process of\ndesertification in which once productive land is degraded into unproductive desert. This is a serious worldwide problem.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 13 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This ice exists primarily in two forms, glaciers and icebergs. Glaciers are large accumulations of ice that exist\nyear-round on the land surface. In contrast, masses ice floating on the ocean are icebergs, although they may have had\ntheir origin in glaciers.\nGlaciers cover about 10% of the Earth\u2019s surface and are powerful erosional agents that sculpt the planet\u2019s surface. These\nenormous masses of ice usually form in mountainous areas that experience cold temperatures and high precipitation.\nGlaciers also occur in low lying areas such as Greenland and Antarctica that remain extremely cold year-round.\n14.1 Glacier Formation\nGlaciers form when repeated annual snowfall accumu-\nlates deep layers of snow that are not completely melted\nin the summer. Thus there is an accumulation of snow that\nbuilds up into deep layers. Perennial snow is a snow accu-\nmulation that lasts all year. A thin accumulation of perennial\nsnow is a snow field. Over repeated seasons of perennial\nsnow, the snow settles, compacts, and bonds with under-\nlying layers. The amount of void space between the snow\ngrains diminishes. As the old snow gets buried\nby more new snow, the older snow layers compact\ninto firn, or n\u00e9v\u00e9, a granular mass of ice crystals. As the firn\ncontinues to be buried, compressed, and recrystal-\nlizes, the void spaces become smaller and the ice\nbecomes less porous, eventually turning into glacier\nFigure 14.1: Glacier in the Bernese Alps. 382 | GLACIERS\nice. Solid glacial ice still retains a fair amount of void space and that traps air. These small air pockets provide records of the\npast atmosphere composition.\nThere are three general types of glaciers: alpine or valley glaciers,\nice sheets, and ice caps. Most alpine glaciers are located in\nthe world\u2019s major mountain ranges such as the Andes, Rockies, Alps,\nand Himalayas, usually occupying long, narrow valleys. Alpine glaci-\ners may also form at lower elevations in areas that receive high\nannual precipitation such as the Olympic Peninsula in Washington\nstate.\nIce sheets, also called\ncontinental glaciers,\nform across millions of\nFigure 14.2: Greenland ice sheet. square kilometers of\nland and are thousands\nof meters thick. Earth\u2019s largest ice sheets are located on Greenland and\nAntarctica. The Greenland Ice Sheet is the largest ice mass in the Northern\nHemisphere with an extensive surface area of over 2 million sq km (1,242,700\nsq mi) and an average thickness of up to 1500 meters (5,000 ft, almost a mile).\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is even larger and covers almost the entire conti-\nnent. The thickest parts of the Antarctic ice sheet are over 4,000 meters\nthick (>13,000 ft or 2.5 mi). Its weight depresses the Antarc-\ntic bedrock to below sea level in many places. The cross-sectional dia-\ngram comparing the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets illustrates\nthe size difference between the two.\nFigure 14.3: Thickness of Greenland ice sheet in\nmeters. GLACIERS | 383\nFigure 14.4: Cross-sectional view of both Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets drawn to scale for size comparison.\nIce cap glaciers are smaller versions of ice sheets that cover less than 50,000 km2 and usually occupy higher elevations\nand may cover tops of mountains. There are several ice caps on Iceland. A small ice cap called Snow Dome is near Mt.\nOlympus on the Olympic Peninsula in the state of Washington.\nFigure 14.5: Snow Dome ice cap near Mt. Olympus, Washington (left) and Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice cap in Iceland (right). 384 | GLACIERS\nFigure 14.6: Maximum extent of Laurentide ice sheet.\nThe figure shows the size of the ancient Laurentide Ice Sheet in the Northern Hemisphere.

In 1948, glaciologists installed hollow vertical\nrods in into the Jungfraufirn Glacier in the Swiss Alps to measure changes in its movement over two years. This study\nshowed that the ice at the surface was fairly rigid and ice within the glacier was actually flowing downhill. The cross-sec-\ntional diagram of an alpine (valley) glacier shows that the rate of ice movement is slow near the bottom, and fastest in the\nmiddle with the top ice being carried along on the ice below.\nFigure 14.8: Cross-section of a valley glacier showing stress (red numbers) increase with depth under the ice. The ice will deform and flow\nwhere the stress is greater than 100 kilopascals, and the relative extent of that deformation is depicted by the red arrows. Down slope\nmovement is shown with blue arrows. The upper ice above the red dashed line does not flow but is pushed along en masse. 386 | GLACIERS\nOne of the unique properties of ice is that it melts under pressure. About half of the overall glacial movement was from\nsliding on a film of meltwater along the bedrock surface and half from internal flow. Ice near the surface of the glacier is\nrigid and brittle to a depth of about 50 m (165 ft). In this brittle zone, large ice cracks called crevasses form on the glac-\nier\u2019s moving surface. These crevasses can be covered and hidden by a snow bridge and are a hazard for glacier travelers.\nBelow the brittle zone, the pressure typically exceeds 100 kilopascals (kPa), which is approximately 100,000 times atmos-\npheric pressure. Under this applied force, the ice no longer breaks, but rather it bends or flows in a zone called the plastic\nzone. This plastic zone represents the great majority of glacier ice. The plastic zone contains a fair amount of sediment of\nvarious grades from boulders to silt and clay. As the bottom of the glacier slides and grinds across the bedrock surface,\nthese sediments act as grinding agents and create a zone of significant erosion.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 14.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

If there is more income (snow accu-\nmulating in winter) than expense (snow and ice melting in\nsummer), then the glacial budget shows growth. A posi-\ntive or negative balance of ice in the overall glacial bud-\nget determines whether a glacier advances or retreats,\nrespectively. The area where the ice balance is growing is\ncalled the zone of accumulation. The area where ice bal-\nance is shrinking is called the zone of ablation.\nThe diagram shows these two zones and the equilib-\nrium line. In the zone of accumulation, the snow accumu-\nlation rate exceeds the snow melting rate and the ice Figure 14.9: Cross-sectional view of an alpine glacier showing internal\nflow lines, zone of accumulation, snow line, and zone of melting.\nsurface is always covered with snow. The equilibrium\nline, also called the snowline or firnline, marks the boundary between the zones of accumulation and ablation. Below the\nequilibrium line in the zone of ablation, the melting rate exceeds snow accumulation leaving the bare ice surface\nexposed. The position of the firnline changes during the season and from year to year as a reflection of a positive or neg-\native ice balance in the glacial budget. Of the two variables affecting a glacier\u2018s budget, winter accumulation and summer\nmelt, summer melt matters most to a glacier\u2019s budget. Cool summers promote glacial advance and warm summers pro-\nmote glacial retreat. GLACIERS | 387\nIf a handful of warmer summers promote glacial retreat, then global cli-\nmate warming over decades and centuries will accelerate glacial melting\nand retreat even faster. Global warming due to human burning of fossil\nfuels is causing the ice sheets to lose in years, an amount of mass that\nwould normally take centuries. Current glacial melting is contributing to ris-\ning sea-levels faster than expected based on previous history.\nAs the Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets melt during global warm-\ning, they become thinner or deflate. The edges of the ice sheets break\noff and fall into the ocean, a process called calving, becoming floating ice-\nbergs. A fjord is a steep-walled valley flooded with sea water. The narrow\nshape of a fjord has been carved out by a glacier during a cooler climate\nperiod. During a warming trend, glacial meltwater may raise the sea level in\nfjords and flood formerly dry valleys. Glacial retreat and deflation are well\nillustrated in the 2009 TED Talk \u201cTime-lapse proof of extreme ice loss\u201d by\nJames Balog.\nFigure 14.10: Fjord.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Erosional landforms\nare formed by the removal of material. Depositional landforms are formed by the addition of material. Because glaciers\nwere first studied by 18th and 19th century geologists in Europe, the terminology applied to glaciers and glacial features\ncontains many terms derived from European languages.\n14.4.1 Erosional Glacial Landforms\nErosional landforms are created when moving masses of glacial ice slide and grind over bedrock. Glacial ice con-\ntains large amounts of poorly sorted sand, gravel, and bouldersthat have been plucked and pried from the bedrock. As\nthe glaciers slide across the bedrock, they grind these sediments into a fine powder called rock flour. Rock flour acts as\nfine grit that polishes the surface of the bedrock to a smooth finish called glacial polish. Larger rock fragments scrape\nover the surface creating elongated grooves called glacial striations.\nFigure 14.11: Glacial striations on granite in Whistler, Canada (left) and Glacial striations in Mt. Rainier National Park (right).\nAlpine glaciers produce a variety of unique erosional landforms, such as\nU-shaped valleys, ar\u00eates, cirques, tarns, horns, cols, hanging val-\nleys, and truncated spurs. In contrast, stream-carved canyons have a V-\nshaped profile when viewed in cross-section. Glacial erosion transforms a\nformer V-shaped stream valley into a U-shaped one. Glaciers are typi-\ncally wider than streams of similar length, and since glaciers tend to\nerode both at their bases and their sides, they erode V-shaped valleys into\nrelatively flat-bottomed broad valleys with steep sides and a distinctive\n\u201cU\u201d shape. As seen in the images, Little Cottonwood Canyon near Salt\nLake City, Utah was occupied by an Ice Age glacier that extended down\nto the mouth of the canyon and into Lake Bonneville. Today, that U-\nshaped valley hosts many erosional landforms, including polished and\nFigure 14.12: The U-shape of the Little Cottonwood\nCanyon, Utah, as it enters into the Salt Lake Valley. striated rock surfaces. In contrast, Big Cottonwood Canyon to the north of\nLittle Cottonwood Canyon has retained the V-shape in its lower portion,\nindicating that its glacier did not extend clear to its mouth, but was confined to its upper portion. GLACIERS | 389\nFigure 14.13: Formation of a glacial valley. Glaciers change the shape of the valley from a \u201cV\u201d shape\nto a \u201cU\u201d.\nWhen glaciers carve two U-shaped valleys adjacent to each other, the ridge between them tends to be sharpened into\na sawtooth feature called an ar\u00eate. At the head of a glacially carved valley is a bowl-shaped feature called a cirque. The\ncirque represents where the head of the glacier eroded the mountain by plucking rock away from it and the weight of\nthe thick ice eroded out a bowl. After the glacier is gone, the bowl at the bottom of the cirque often fills with precipita-\ntion and is occupied by a lake, called a tarn. When three or more mountain glaciers erode headward at their cirques, they\nproduce horns, steep-sided, spire-shaped mountains. Low points along ar\u00eates or between horns are mountain passes\ntermed cols. Where a smaller tributary glacier flows into a larger trunk glacier, the smaller glacier cuts down less. Once\nthe ice has gone, the tributary valley is left as a hanging valley, sometimes with a waterfall plunging into the main valley.\nAs the trunk glacier straightens and widens a V-shaped valley and erodes the ends of side ridges, a steep triangle-shaped\ncliff is formed called a truncated spur.\nFigure 14.14: Cirque with Upper Thornton Lake in the North Cascades National Park, Washington (left).

Bridalveil Falls in Yosemite National Park, California (right) is a good example of a hanging valley. 390 | GLACIERS\n14.4.2 Depositional Glacial Landforms\nDepositional landforms and materials are produced from deposits\nleft behind by a retreating glacier. All glacial deposits are called\ndrift. These include till, tillites, diamictites, terminal moraines,\nrecessional moraines, lateral moraines, medial moraines, ground\nmoraines, silt, outwash plains, glacial erratics, kettles, kettle\nlakes, crevasses, eskers, kames, and drumlins.\nGlacial ice carries a lot of sediment, which when deposited by a\nmelting glacier is called till. Till is poorly sorted with grain sizes\nranging from clay and silt to pebbles and boulders. These clasts\nmay be striated. Many depositional landforms are composed of\ntill. The term tillite refers to lithified rock having glacial ori-\ngins. Diamictite refers to a lithified rock that contains a wide range of Figure 14.15: Boulder of diamictite of the Mineral Fork\nclast sizes; this includes glacial till but is a more objective and Formation, Antelope Island, Utah, United States.\ndescriptive term for any rock with a wide range of clast sizes.\nMoraines are mounded deposits consisting of glacial till carried in the glacial ice and rock fragments dislodged by mass\nwasting from the U-shaped valley walls. The glacier acts like a conveyor belt, carrying and depositing sediment at the\nend of and along the sides of theice flow. Because the ice in the glacier is always flowing downslope, all glaciers have\nmoraines build up at their terminus, even those not advancing.\nMoraines are classified by their location with respect to the glacier. A terminal moraine is a ridge of till located at the end\nor terminus of the glacier. Recessional moraines are left as glaciers retreat and there are pauses in the retreat. Lateral\nmoraines accumulate along the sides of the glacier from material mass wasted from the valley walls. When two tributary\nglaciers merge, the two lateral moraines combine to form a medial moraine running down the center of the combined\nglacier. Ground moraine is a veneer of till left on the land as the glacier melts.\nFigure 14.16: Lateral moraines of Kaskawulsh Glacier within Kluane National Park in the Canadian territory of Yukon (left) and Medial moraines\nwhere tributary glaciers meet. At least seven tributary glaciers from upstream have joined to form the trunk glacier flowing on out of the upper\nleft of the picture (right).\nIn addition to moraines, glaciers leave behind other depositional landforms. Silt, sand, and gravel produced by the intense\ngrinding process are carried by streams of water and depositedin front of the glacier in an area called the outwash plain.\nRetreating glaciers may leave behind large boulders that don\u2019t match the local bedrock. These are called glacial errat-\nics. When continental glaciers retreat, they can leave behind large blocks of ice within the till. These ice blocks melt and\ncreate a depression in the till called a kettle. If the depression later fills with water, it is called a kettle lake. GLACIERS | 391\nIf meltwater flowing over the ice surface descends into crevasses in the ice, it may find a channel and continue to flow in\nsinuous channels within or at the base of the glacier. Within or under continental glaciers, these streams carry sedi-\nments. When the ice recedes, the accumulated sediment is deposited as a long sinuous ridge known as an esker. Melt-\nwater descending down through the ice or over the margins of the ice may deposit mounds of till in hills called kames.\nDrumlins are common in continentalglacial areas of Ger-\nmany, New York, and Wisconsin, where they typically are\nfound in fields with great numbers. A drumlin is an elon-\ngated asymmetrical teardrop-shaped hill reflecting ice\nmovement with its steepest side pointing upstream to the\nflow of ice and its streamlined or low-angled side pointing\ndownstream in the direction of ice movement.\nGlacial scientists debate the origins of drumlins. A leading\nidea is that drumlins are created from accumulated till\nbeing compressed and sculpted under aglacier that\nretreated then advanced again over its own ground\nmoraine. Another idea is that meltwater catastrophically\nFigure 14.17: A small group of Ice Age drumlins in Germany.\nflooded under the glacier and carved the till into these\nstreamlined mounds. Still another proposes that the weight of the overlying ice statically deformed the underlying till.\nComplete this interactive activity to check your understanding.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this interactive activity via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

A lake con-\nfined within a glacial cirque is called a tarn. A tarn forms when the depression\nin the cirque fills with precipitation after the ice is gone. Examples of\ntarns include Silver Lake near Brighton Ski resort in Big Cottonwood Canyon,\nUtah and Avalanche Lake in Glacier National Park, Montana.\nWhen recessional moraines\ncreate a series of isolated\nbasins in a glaciated valley, the\nresulting chain of lakes\nis called paternoster lakes.\nLakes filled by glacial meltwa-\nter often looks milky due to\nfinely ground material called\nrock flour suspended in the\nFigure 14.18: Tarn in a cirque.\nwater.\nLong, glacially carved\nFigure 14.19: Paternoster lakes.\ndepressions filled with\nwater are known as finger lakes. Proglacial lakes form along the edges\nof all the largest continental ice sheets, such as Antarctica and Green-\nland. The crust is depressed isostatically by the overlying ice sheet and\nthese basins fill with glacial meltwater. Many such lakes, some of them\nhuge, existed at various times along the southern edge of the Laurentide\nIce Sheet. Lake Agassiz, Manitoba, Canada, is a classic example of\na proglacial lake. Lake Winnipeg serves as the remnant of a much\nlarger proglacial lake.\nFigure 14.20: Satellite view of Finger Lakes region of\nNew York.\nFigure 14.21: Extent of Lake Agassiz. GLACIERS | 393\nOther proglacial lakes were formed when glaciers dammed rivers and flooded the river valley. A classic example is Lake\nMissoula, which formed when a lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet blocked the Clark Fork River about 18,000 years ago.\nOver about 2000 years the ice dam holding back Lake Missoula failed several times. During each breach, the lake emptied\nacross parts of eastern Washington, Oregon, and Idaho into the Columbia River Valley and eventually the Pacific Ocean.\nAfter each breach, the dam reformed and the lake refilled. Each breach produced a catastrophic flood over a few days.\nScientists estimate that this cycle of ice dam, proglacial lake, and torrential massive flooding happened at least 25 times\nover a span of 20 centuries. The rate of each outflow is believed to have equaled the combined discharge of all of Earth\u2019s\ncurrent rivers combined.\nThe landscape produced by these massive floods is preserved\nin the Channeled Scablands of Idaho, Washington, and Ore-\ngon.\nFigure 14.22: View of Channeled Scablands in central Washington\nshowing huge potholes and massive erosion.\nFigure 14.23: Pluvial lakes in the western United States. 394 | GLACIERS\nPluvial lakes form in humid environments that experience\nlow temperatures and high precipitation. During the last\nglaciation, most of the western United States\u2019 climate was\ncooler and more humid than today. Under these low-evap-\noration conditions, many large lakes, called pluvial lakes,\nformed in the basins of the Basin and Range Province. Two\nof the largest were Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahon-\ntan. Lake Lahontan was in northwestern Nevada. The figure\nillustrates the tremendous size of Lake Bonneville, which\noccupied much of western Utah and into eastern Nevada.\nThe lake level fluctuated greatly over the centuries leaving\nseveral pronounced old shorelines marked by wave-cut\nterraces. These old shorelines can be seen on mountain\nFigure 14.24: The Great Lakes.\nslopes throughout the western portion of Utah, including\nthe Salt Lake Valley, indicating that the now heavily urbanized valley was once filled with hundreds of feet of water. Lake\nBonneville\u2019s level peaked around 18,000 years ago when a breach occurred at Red Rock Pass in Idaho and water spilled\ninto the Snake River. The flooding rapidly lowered the lake level and scoured the Idaho landscape across the Pocatello Val-\nley, the Snake River Plain, and Twin Falls. The floodwaters ultimately flowed into the Columbia River across part of the sca-\nblands area at an incredible discharge rate of about 4,750 cu km/sec (1,140 cumi/sec). For comparison, this discharge rate\nwould drain the volume of Lake Michigan completely dry within a few days.\nThe five Great Lakes in North America\u2019s upper Midwest are proglacial lakes that originated during the last ice age. The lake\nbasins were originally carved by the encroaching continental ice sheet. The basins were later exposed as the ice retreated\nabout 14,000 years ago and filled by precipitation.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 14.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Four major, well-documented glaciations have occurred in Earth\u2019s history: one during the\nArchean-early Proterozoic Eon, ~2.5 billion years ago; another in late Proterozoic Eon, ~700 million years ago; another in\nthe Pennsylvanian, 323 to 300 million years ago, and most recently during the Pliocene-Pleistocene epochs starting 2.5\nmillion years ago (chapter 8). Some scientists also recognize a minor glaciation around 440 million years ago in Africa.\nThe best-studied glaciation is, of course, the most recent. This infographic illustrates the glacial and climate changes\nover the last 20,000 years, ending with those caused by human actions since the Industrial Revolution. The Pliocene-Pleis-\ntocene glaciation was a series of several glacial cycles, possibly 18 in total. Antarctic ice-core records exhibit especially GLACIERS | 395\nstrong evidence for eight glacial advances occurring within the last 420,000 years. The last of these is known in popular\nmedia as \u201cThe Ice Age,\u201d but geologists refer to it as the Last Glacial Maximum. The glacial advance reached its maximum\nbetween 26,500 and 19,000 years ago.\n14.5.1 Causes of Glaciations\nGlaciations occur due to both long-term and short-term factors. In the geologic sense, long-term means a scale of tens to\nhundreds of millions of years and short-term means a scale of hundreds to thousands of years.\nLong-term causes include plate tectonics breaking up the supercontinents (see Wilson Cycle, chapter 2), moving land\nmasses to high latitudes near the north or south poles, and changing ocean circulation. For example, the closing of the\nPanama Strait and isolation of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans may have triggered a change in precipitation cycles, which\ncombined with a cooling climate to help expand the ice sheets.\nShort-term causes of glacial fluctuations are attrib-\nuted to the cycles in the Earth\u2019s rotational-axis and to vari-\nations in the earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun which affect the\ndistance between Earth and the Sun. Called Milankovitch\nCycles, these cycles affect the amount of incoming solar\nradiation, causing short-term cycles of warming and cool-\ning.\nDuring the Cenozoic Era, carbon dioxide levels steadily\ndecreased from a maximum in the Paleocene, causing the\nclimate to gradually cool. By the Pliocene, ice sheets\nbegan to form. The effects of theMilankovitch Cycles cre-\nFigure 14.25: Atomospheric CO2 has declined during the Cenozoic from a\nated short-term cycles of warming and cooling within the\nmaximum in the Paleocene\u2013Eocene up to the Industrial Revolution.\nlarger glaciation event.\nMilankovitch Cycles are three orbital changes named after the Serbian astronomer Milutan Milankovitch. The three orbital\nchanges are called precession, obliquity, and eccentricity. Precession is the wobbling of Earth\u2019s axis with a period of\nabout 21,000 years; obliquity is changes in the angle of Earth\u2019s axis with a period of about 41,000 years; and eccentricity\nis variations in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun leading to changes in distance from the sun with a period of 93,000 years.\nThese orbital changes created a 41,000-year-long glacial\u2013interglacial Milankovitch Cycle from 2.5 to 1.0 million years ago,\nfollowed by another longer cycle of about 100,000 years from 1.0 million years ago to today (see Milankovitch Cycles).\nComplete this interactive activity to check your understanding.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this interactive activity via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Since the Last Glacial Maximum\nabout 19,000 years ago, sea-level has risen about 125 m (400 ft). A global change in sea level is called eustatic sea-level\nchange. During a warming trend, sea-level rises due to more water being added to the ocean and also thermal expan-\nsion of sea water. About half of the Earth\u2019s eustatic sea-level rise during the last century has been the result of glaciers\nmelting and about half due to thermal expansion. Thermal expansion describes how a solid, liquid, or gas expands in vol-\nume with an increase in temperature. This 30 second video demonstrates thermal expansion with the classic brass ball\nand ring experiment.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

In\nother words, sea-level change is measured relative to land elevation. For example, if the land rises a lot and sea-level\nrises only a little, then the relative sea-level would appear to drop. GLACIERS | 397\nContinents sitting on the lithosphere can move vertically upward as a result of two main processes, tectonic uplift and\nisostatic rebound. Tectonic uplift occurs when tectonic plates collide (see chapter 2). Isostatic rebound describes the\nupward movement of lithospheric crust sitting on top of the asthenospheric layer below it. Continental crust bearing the\nweight of continental ice sinks into the asthenosphere displacing it. After the ice sheet melts away, the asthenosphere\nflows back in and continental crust floats back upward. Erosion can also create isostatic rebound by removing large\nmasses like mountains and transporting the sediment away (think of the Mesozoic removal of the Alleghanian Mountains\nand the uplift of the Appalachian plateau; chapter 8), albeit this process occurs more slowly than relatively rapid glacier\nmelting.\nThe isostatic-rebound map below shows rates of vertical\ncrustal movement worldwide. The highest rebound rate is\nindicated by the blue-to-purple zones (top end of the\nscale). The orange-to-red zones (bottom end of the\nscale) surrounding the high-rebound zones indicate isosta-\ntic lowering as adjustments in displaced subcrustal mater-\nial have taken place.\nMost glacial isostatic rebound is occurring where conti-\nnental ice sheets rapidly melted about 19,000 years\nago, such as in Canada and Scandinavia. Its effects can be\nseen wherever Ice Age ice or water bodies are or\nwere present on continental surfaces and in terraces on\nriver floodplains that cross these areas. Isostatic rebound\noccurred in Utah when the water from Lake Bon-\nFigure 14.26: Rate of isostatic rebound.\nneville drained away. North America\u2019s Great Lakes also\nexhibit emergent coastline features caused by isostatic\nrebound since the continental ice sheet retreated.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 14.5 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

There are three types\nof glaciers, alpine or valley glaciers that occupy valleys, ice sheets that cover continental areas, and ice caps that cover\nsmaller areas usually at higher elevations. As the ice accumulates, it begins to flow downslope and outward under its own\nweight. Glacial ice is divided into two zones, the upper rigid or brittle zone where the ice cracks into crevasses and the\nlower plastic zone where under the pressure of overlying ice, the ice bends and flows exhibiting ductile behavior. Rock\nmaterial that falls onto the ice by mass wasting or is plucked and carried by the ice is called moraine and acts as grinding\nagents against the bedrock creating significant erosion.\nGlaciers have a budget of income and expense. The zone of income for the glacier is called the Zone of Accumulation,\nwhere snow is converted into firn then ice by compression and recrystallization, and the zone of expense called the Zone\nof Ablation, where ice melts or sublimes away. The line separating these two zones latest in the year is the Equilibrium or\nFirn Line and can be seen on the glacier separating bare ice from snow covered ice. If the glacial budget is balanced,\neven though the ice continues to flow downslope, the end or terminus of the glacier remains in a stable position. If income\nis greater than expense, the position of the terminus moves downslope. If expense is greater than income, a circumstance\nnow affecting glaciers and ice sheets worldwide due to global warming, the terminus recedes. If this situation continues,\nthe glaciers will disappear. An average of cooler summers affects the stability or growth of glaciers more than higher\nsnowfall. As the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets flow seaward, the edges calve off forming icebergs.\nGlaciers create two kinds of landforms, erosional and depositional. Alpine glaciers carve U-shaped valleys and\nmoraine carried in the ice polishes and grooves or striates the bedrock. Other landscape features produced by erosion\ninclude horns, ar\u00eate ridges, cirques, hanging valleys, cols, and truncated spurs. Cirques may contain eroded basins that\nare occupied by post glacial lakes called tarns. Depositional features result from deposits left by retreating ice called drift.\nThese include till, and moraine deposits (terminal, recessional, lateral, medial, and ground), eskers, kames, kettles and\nkettle lakes, erratics, and drumlins. A series of recessional moraines in glaciated valleys may create basins that are later\nfilled with water to become paternoster lakes. Glacial meltwater carries fine grained sediment onto the outwash plain.\nLakes containing glacial meltwater are milky in color from suspended finely ground rock flour. Ice Age climate was more\nhumid and precipitation that did not become glacier ice filled regional depressions to become pluvial lakes. Examples\nof pluvial lakes include Lake Missoula dammed behind an ice sheet lobe and Lake Bonneville in Utah whose shoreline\nremnants can be seen on mountainsides. Repeated breaching of the ice lobe allowed Lake Missoula to rapidly drain caus-\ning massive floods that scoured the Channeled Scablands of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 14 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In science, a system is a group of interacting objects and processes. Earth\nSystem Science is the study of these systems: geosphere\u2014rocks; atmosphere\u2014gasses; hydrosphere\u2014water; cryos-\nphere\u2014ice; and biosphere\u2014living things. Earth science studies these systems and how they interact and change in\nresponse to natural cycles and human-driven, or anthropogenic forces. Changes in one Earth system affect other systems.\nIt is critically important for us to be aware of the geologic context of climate change processes and how these Earth sys-\ntems interact, first, for us to understand how and why human activities cause present-day climate change and, secondly,\nto distinguish between natural processes and human processes in the geologic past\u2019s climate record.\nA significant part of this chapter introduces and discusses various processes from these Earth systems, how they influence\neach other, and how they impact global climate. For example, Earth\u2019s temperature and climate largely change based on\natmospheric gas composition, ocean circulation, and the land-surface characteristics of rocks, glaciers, and plants.\nAlso necessary to understanding climate change is to distinguish between climate and weather. Weather is the short-\nterm temperature and precipitation patterns that occur in days and weeks. Climate is the variable range of temperature\nand precipitation patterns averaged over the long-term for a particular region (see section 13.1). Thus, a single cold winter\ndoes not mean that the entire globe is cooling\u2014indeed, the United States\u2019 cold winters of 2013 and 2014 occurred while the\nrest of the Earth was experiencing record warm-winter temperatures. To avoid these generalizations, many scientists use\na 30-year average as a good baseline. Therefore, climate change refers to slow temperature and precipitation changes\nand trends over the long term for a particular area or the Earth as a whole.\n15.1 Earth\u2019s Temperature\nWithout an atmosphere, Earth would have huge temperature fluctuations between day and night, like the moon. Daytime\ntemperatures would be hundreds of degrees Celsius above normal, and nighttime temperatures would be hundreds of\ndegrees below normal. Because the Moon doesn\u2019t have much of an atmosphere, its daytime temperatures are around GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE | 403\n106 \u00b0C (224\u2109) and nighttime temperatures are around -183\u00b0C (-298\u2109). That is an astonishing 272\u00b0C (522\u00b0F) degree range\nbetween the Moon\u2019s light side and dark side. This section describes how Earth\u2019s atmosphere is involved in regulating the\nEarth\u2019s temperature.\n15.1.1 Composition of Atmosphere\nThe atmosphere\u2019s composition is a key component in regulating the planet\u2019s temperature.\nThe atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen (N2), 21 percent oxygen (O2), one percent argon (Ar),\nand less than one percent trace components, which are all other gases. Trace components\ninclude carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H2O), neon, helium, and methane. Water vapor is\nhighly variable, mostly based on region, and composes about one percent of the atmos-\nphere. Trace component gasses include several important greenhouse gases, which are the\ngases responsible for warming and cooling the plant. On a geologic scale, volcanoes and\nthe weathering process, which bury CO2 in sediments, are the atmosphere\u2019s CO2 sources.\nBiological processes both add and subtract CO2 from the atmosphere.\nGreenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet by absorbing some of\nthe longer-wave outgoing infrared radiation that is emitted from Earth, thus keeping heat\nfrom being lost to space. More greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb more longwave\nheat and make the planet warmer. Greenhouse gasses have little effect on shorter-wave\nincoming solar radiation.\nThe most common greenhouse\ngases are water vapor (H2O), car-\nbon dioxide (CO2), methane\nFigure 15.1: Composition of the (CH4), and\natmosphere. nitrous oxide (N2O). Water vapor\nis the most abundant greenhouse\ngas, but its atmospheric abundance does not change much\nover time. Carbon dioxide is much less abundant than water\nvapor, but carbon dioxide is being added to the atmosphere by\nhuman activities such as burning fossil fuels, land-use changes,\nand deforestation. Further, natural processes such as vol-\ncanic eruptions add carbon dioxide, but at an insignificant rate\ncompared to human-caused contributions.\nThere are two important reasons why carbon dioxide is the most\nimportant greenhouse gas. First, carbon dioxide stays in the\natmosphere and does not go away for hundreds of years. Sec-\nFigure 15.2: Common greenhouse gases.\nond, most of the additional carbon dioxide is \u201cfossil\u201d in origin,\nwhich means that it is released by burning fossil fuels. For example, coal and petroleum are fossil fuels. Coal and oil are\nmade from long-dead plant material, which was originally created by photosynthesis millions of years ago and stored in\nthe ground. Photosynthesis takes sunlight plus carbon dioxide and creates the substances of plants. This transformation\noccurs over millions of years as a slow process, accumulating fossil carbon in rocks and sediments. So, when we burn\ncoal and oil, we instantaneously release the stored solar energy and fossil carbon dioxide that took millions of years to\naccumulate in the first place. The rate of release is critical to comprehend current climate change.\n15.1.2 Carbon Cycle\nCritical to understanding global climate change is to understand the carbon cycle and how Earth\u2019s own carbon-balancing\nsystem is being rapidly thrown off balance by human-driven activities. Earth has two important carbon cycles: the biological 404 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nand the geological. In the biological cycle, living organisms\u2014mostly plants\u2014consume carbon dioxide from the atmos-\nphere to make their tissues and substances through photosynthesis. Then, after the organisms die, and when they decay\nover years or decades, that carbon is released back into the atmosphere. The following is the general equation for photo-\nsynthesis.\nCO2 + H2O + sunlight \u2192 sugars + O2\nIn the geological carbon cycle, a portion of the biological-cycle carbon becomes part of the geological carbon cycle: plant\nmaterials into coal and petroleum, tiny fragments and molecules into organic-rich shale, and the carbonate bearing cal-\ncareous shells and other parts of marine organisms into limestone. Such materials become buried and become part of\nthe slow geologic formation of coal and other sedimentary materials. This cycle actually involves most of Earth\u2019s carbon\nand operates very slowly.\nFigure 15.3: Carbon cycle.\nThe following are geological carbon-cycle storage reservoirs:\n\u2022 Organic matter from plants is stored in peat, coal, and permafrost for thousands to millions of years.\n\u2022 Silicate\u2013mineral weathering converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, which is stored in the\noceans for thousands to tens of thousands of years.\n\u2022 Marine organisms convert dissolved bicarbonate to forms of calcite, which is stored in carbonate rocks for tens to\nhundreds of millions of years.\n\u2022 Carbon compounds are directly stored in sediments for tens to hundreds of millions of years; some end up in petro-\nleum deposits.\n\u2022 Carbon-bearing sediments are transferred by subduction to the mantle, where the carbon may be stored for tens of\nmillions to billions of years.\n\u2022 Carbon dioxide from within the Earth is released back to the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions, where it is\nstored for years to decades. GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE | 405\nDuring much of Earth\u2019s history, the geological carbon cycle has been balanced by volcanos releasing carbon at approxi-\nmately the same rate that carbon is stored by the other processes. Under these conditions, Earth\u2019s climate has remained\nrelatively stable. However, in Earth\u2019s history, there have been times when that balance has been upset. This can happen\nduring prolonged stretches of above-average volcanic activity. One example is the Siberian Traps eruption around 250 mil-\nlion years ago, which contributed to strong climate warming over a few million years.\nA carbon imbalance is also associated with significant mountain-building events. For example, the Himalayan Range has\nbeen forming for about 40 million years, and over that time\u2014and still today\u2014the rate of weathering on Earth has been\nenhanced because those mountains are so huge and the range is so extensive that they present a greater surface area on\nwhich weathering takes place. The weathering of these rocks\u2014most importantly the hydrolysis of feldspar\u2014has resulted\nin consumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide and transfer of the carbon to the oceans and to ocean-floor carbonate-rich\nsediments. The steady drop in carbon dioxide levels over the past 40 million years, which contributed to the Pliocene-\nPleistocene glaciations, is partly attributable to the formation of the Himalayan Range.\nAnother, nongeological form of carbon-cycle imbalance is happening today on a very rapid time scale. In just a few\ndecades, humans have extracted volumes of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas, which were stored in rocks over the\npast several hundred million years, and converted these fuels to energy and carbon dioxide. By doing so, we are changing\nthe climate faster than has ever happened in the past. Remember, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere and does not\ngo away for hundreds of years. The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat is trapped and the warmer\nthe planet becomes.\n15.1.3 Greenhouse Effect\nThe greenhouse effect is the reason our global temperature is rising, but it\u2019s important to understand what this effect is\nand how it occurs. The greenhouse effect occurs because greenhouse gases are present in the atmosphere. The green-\nhouse effect is named after a similar process that warms a greenhouse or a car on a hot summer day. Sunlight passes\nthrough the glass of the greenhouse or car, reaches the interior, and changes into heat. The heat radiates upward and gets\ntrapped by the glass windows. The greenhouse effect for the Earth can be explained in three steps.\nStep 1: Solar radiation from the sun is composed of mostly ultraviolet (UV), visible light, and infrared (IR) radiation. Com-\nponents of solar radiation include parts with a shorter wavelength than visible light, like ultraviolet light, and parts of the\nspectrum with longer wavelengths, like IR and others. Some of the radiation gets absorbed, scattered, or reflected by the\natmospheric gases but about half of the solar radiation eventually reaches the Earth\u2019s surface.\nStep 2: The visible, UV, and IR radiation, that reaches the\nsurface converts to heat energy. Most students have expe-\nrienced sunlight warming a surface such as pavement, a\npatio, or deck. When this occurs, the warmer surface then\nemits thermal radiation, which is a type of IR radiation. So,\nthere is a conversion from visible, UV, and IR to just thermal\nIR. This thermal IR is what we experience as heat. If you\nhave ever felt heat radiating from a fire or a hot stove top,\nthen you have experienced thermal IR.\nStep 3: Thermal IR radiates from the earth\u2019s surface back\ninto the atmosphere. But since it is thermal IR instead of\nUV, visible, or regular IR, this thermal IR gets trapped by\ngreenhouse gases. In other words, the sun\u2019s energy leaves\nthe Earth at a different wavelength than it enters, so the\nFigure 15.4: Incoming radiation absorbed, scattered, and reflected by\nsun\u2019s energy is not absorbed in the lower atmosphere atmospheric gases.\nwhen energy is coming in, but rather when the energy is 406 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\ngoing out. The gases that are mostly responsible for this energy blocking on Earth include carbon dioxide, water vapor,\nmethane, and nitrous oxide. More greenhouse gases in the atmosphere results in more thermal IR being trapped. Explore\nthis external link to an interactive animation on the greenhouse effect from the National Academy of Sciences.\n15.1.4 Earth\u2019s Energy Budget\nThe solar radiation that reaches Earth is relatively uniform over time. Earth is warmed, and energy or heat radiates from the\nEarth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere back to space. This flow of incoming and outgoing energy is Earth\u2019s energy bud-\nget. For Earth\u2019s temperature to be stable over long stretches of time, incoming energy and outgoing energy have to be\nequal on average so that the energy budget at the top of the atmosphere balances. About 29 percent of the incoming\nsolar energy arriving at the top of the atmosphere is reflected back to space by clouds, atmospheric particles, or reflective\nground surfaces like sea ice and snow. About 23 percent of incoming solar energy is absorbed in the atmosphere by water\nvapor, dust, and ozone. The remaining 48 percent passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed at the surface. Thus,\nabout 71 percent of the total incoming solar energy is absorbed by the Earth system.\nFigure 15.5: Incoming solar radiation filtered by the atmosphere.\nWhen this energy reaches Earth, the atoms and molecules that makeup the atmosphere and surface absorb the energy,\nand Earth\u2019s temperature increases. If this material only absorbed energy, then the temperature of the Earth would con-\ntinue to increase and eventually overheat. For example, if you continuously run a faucet in a stopped-up sink, the water\nlevel rises and eventually overflows. However, temperature does not infinitely rise because the Earth is not just absorb-\ning sunlight; it is also radiating thermal energy or heat back into the atmosphere. If the temperature of the Earth rises, the\nplanet emits an increasing amount of heat to space, and this is the primary mechanism that prevents Earth from continually\nheating. GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE | 407\nSome of the thermal infrared heat radiating from the sur-\nface is absorbed and trapped by greenhouse gasses in the\natmosphere, which act like a giant canopy over Earth. The\nmore greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more out-\ngoing heat Earth retains, and the less thermal infrared heat\ndissipates to space.\nFactors that can affect the Earth\u2019s energy budget are not\nlimited to greenhouse gases. Increasing solar energy can\nincrease the energy Earth receives. However, these\nincreases are very small over time. In addition, land and\nwater will absorb more sunlight when there is less ice and\nsnow to reflect the sunlight back to the atmosphere. For\nexample, the ice covering the Arctic Sea reflects sunlight\nFigure 15.6: Some of the thermal infrared energy (heat) radiated from\nback to the atmosphere; this reflectivity is called albedo. the surface into the atmosphere is trapped by gasses in the\nFurthermore, aerosols (dust particles) produced from burn- atmosphere.\ning coal, diesel engines, and volcanic eruptions can\nreflect incoming solar radiation and actually cool the planet. While the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on the cli-\nmate\u2019s system is weak, the effect of human-produced greenhouse gases is not weak. Thus, the net effect of human activ-\nity is warming due to more anthropogenic greenhouse gases associated with fossil fuel combustion.\nAn effect that changes the planet can trigger feedback\nmechanisms that amplify or suppress the original effect.\nA positive feedback mechanism occurs when the output\nor effect of a process enhances the original stimulus or\ncause. Thus, it increases the ongoing effect. For example,\nthe loss of sea ice at the North Pole makes that area less\nreflective, reducing albedo. This allows the surface air and\nocean to absorb more energy in an area that was once cov-\nered by sea ice. Another example is melting per-\nmafrost. Permafrost is permanently frozen soil located in\nthe high latitudes, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. As\nthe climate warms, more permafrost thaws, and the thick\ndeposits of organic matter are exposed to oxygen and Figure 15.7: Net effect of factors influencing warming.\nbegin to decay. This oxidation process releases carbon\ndioxide and methane, which in turn causes more warming, which melts more permafrost, and so on and on.\nA negative feedback mechanism occurs when the output or effect reduces the original stimulus or cause. For example, in\nthe short term, more carbon dioxide (CO2) is expected to cause forest canopies to grow, which absorb more CO2. Another\nexample for the long term is that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will cause more carbonic acid and chemi-\ncal weathering, which results in transporting dissolved bicarbonate and other ions to the oceans, which are then stored in\nsediment.\nGlobal warming is evidence that Earth\u2019s energy budget is not balanced. Positive effects on Earth\u2019s temperature are now\ngreater than negative effects. 408 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 15.1 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

While this seems like a new idea, it was sug-\ngested more than 75 years ago. This section describes the evidence of what most scientists agree is anthropogenic or\nhuman-caused climate change.

Changes in land-surface or ocean-\nsurface temperatures compared to a reference period\nfrom 1951 to 1980, where the long-term average remained\nrelatively constant, are called temperature anomalies. A\ntemperature anomaly thus represents the difference\nbetween the measured temperature and the average\nvalue during the reference period.

Therefore, an anomaly of 1.25 \u2103 (34.3\u00b0F) for\n2015 means that the average temperature for 2015 was 1.25 \u2103 (34.3\u00b0F) greater than the 1900-2000 average. In 1950, the\ntemperature anomaly was -0.28 \u2103 (31.5\u00b0F), so this is -0.28 \u2103 (31.5\u00b0F) lower than the 1900-2000 average. These tempera-\ntures are annual average measured surface temperatures.\nThis video figure of temperature anomalies shows worldwide temperature changes since 1880. The more blue, the\ncooler; the more yellow and red, the warmer.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The record is shown as a running five-year average.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access this YouTube video via the QR code.\nIn addition to average land-surface temperatures rising, the ocean has absorbed much heat. Because oceans cover about\n70 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface and have such a high specific heat value, they provide a large opportunity to absorb\nenergy. The ocean has been absorbing about 80 to 90 percent of human activities\u2019 additional heat. As a result, tempera-\nture in the ocean\u2019s top 701.4 m (2,300 ft) has increased by -17.6\u00b0C (0.3\u2109) since 1969 (watch this 3 minute video by NASA\nJPL on the ocean\u2019s heat capacity). The reason the ocean has warmed less than the atmosphere, while still taking on most\nof the heat, is due to water\u2019s very high specific heat, which means that water can absorb a lot of heat energy with a small\ntemperature increase. In contrast, the lower specific heat of the atmosphere means it has a higher temperature increase\nas it absorbs less heat energy.\nSome scientists suggest that anthropogenic greenhouse gases do not cause global warming because between 1998 and\n2013, Earth\u2019s surface temperatures did not increase much, despite greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to increase.\nHowever, since the oceans are absorbing most of the heat, decade-scale circulation changes in the ocean, similar to La\nNi\u00f1a, push warmer water deeper under the surface. Once the ocean\u2019s absorption and circulation is accounted for, and this 410 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nheat is added back into surface temperatures, then temperature increases become apparent, as shown in the figure. Also,\nthe ocean\u2019s heat storage is temporary, as reflected in the record-breaking warm years of 2014-2016. Indeed, with this tem-\nporary ocean-storage effect, the twenty-first century\u2019s first 15 of its 16 years were the hottest in recorded history.\n15.2.2 Carbon Dioxide\nAnthropogenic greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2), have increased since the industrial revolution when\nhumans dramatically increased burning fossil fuels. These levels are unprecedented in the last 800,000-year Earth history\nas recorded in geologic sources such as ice cores. Carbon dioxide has increased by 40 percent since 1750, and the rate of\nincrease has been the fastest during the last decade. For example, since 1750, 20409 tonnes (2040 gigatons) of CO2 have\nbeen added to the atmosphere; about 40 percent has remained in the atmosphere while the remaining 60 percent has\nbeen absorbed into the land by plants and soil or into the oceans. Indeed, during the lifetime of most young adults, the\ntotal atmospheric CO2 has increased by 50 ppm, or 15 percent.\nCharles Keeling, an oceanographer with Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, was the first person to\nregularly measure atmospheric CO2. Using his methods, scientists at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, have constantly\nmeasured atmospheric CO2 since 1957. NASA regularly publishes these measurements at https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu.\nGo there now to see the very latest measurement. Keeling\u2019s measured values have been posted in a curve of increasing\nvalues, called the Keeling Curve. This curve varies up and down in a regular annual cycle, from summer when the plants in\nthe Northern Hemisphere are using CO2 to winter when the plants are dormant. But the curve shows a steady CO2 increase\nover the past several decades. This curve increases exponentially, not linearly, showing that the rate of CO2 increase is itself\nincreasing!\nFigure 15.9: Latest CO2 reading as of September 20, 2022.\nFigure 15.10: Keeling curve graph of the carbon dioxide concentration at Mauna Loa Observatory as\nof September 20, 2022.\nThe following Atmospheric CO2 video shows how atmospheric CO2 has varied recently and over the last 800,000 years, as\ndetermined by an increasing number of CO2 monitoring stations as shown on the insert map.

The remaining 60\npercent gets absorbed by the ocean and vegetation. The ocean has absorbed about 30 percent of that carbon dioxide.\nWhen carbon dioxide gets absorbed in the ocean, it creates carbonic acid. This makes the ocean more acidic, which then\nhas an impact on marine organisms that secrete calcium carbonate shells. Recall that hydrochloric acid reacts by effer-\nvescing with limestone rock made of calcite, which is calcium carbonate.

For example, during the Meso-\nzoic Era, the Age of Dinosaurs, the climate was much warmer, and carbon dioxide\nwas abundant in the atmosphere. However, throughout the Cenozoic Era, 65 million\nyears ago to today, the climate has been gradually cooling. This section summarizes\nsome of these major past climate changes.\n15.3.1 Past Glaciations\nThrough geologic history, climate has changed slowly over millions of years. Before\nthe most recent Pliocene-Quaternary glaciation, there were other major glaciations.\nThe oldest, known as the Huronian, occurred toward the end of the Archean Eon-early\nProterozoic Eon, about 2.5 billion years ago. The event of that time, the Great Oxy-\ngenation Event, was a major happening (see chapter 8) most commonly associated\nwith causing that glaciation. The increased oxygen is thought to have reacted with the\npotent greenhouse gas methane, causing cooling.\nThe end of the Proterozoic Eon, about 700 million years ago, had other glaciations.\nThese ancient Precambrian glaciations are included in the Snowball Earth hypoth-\nesis. Widespread global rock sequences from these ancient times contain evidence Figure 15.12: Maximum extent of\nthat glaciers existed even in low-latitudes. Two examples are limestone rock\u2014usually Laurentide Ice Sheet.\nformed in tropical marine environments\u2014and glacial deposits\u2014usually formed in\ncold climates\u2014have been found together from this time in many regions around the world. One example is in Utah. Evi-\ndence of continental glaciation is seen in interbedded limestone and glacial deposits (diamictites) on Antelope Island\nin the Great Salt Lake.\nThe controversial Snowball Earth hypothesis suggests that a runaway albedo effect\u2014where ice and snow reflect solar\nradiation and increasingly spread from polar regions toward the equator\u2014caused land and ocean surfaces to completely\nfreeze and biological activity to collapse. Thinking is that because carbon dioxide could not enter the then-frozen ocean,\nthe ice covering Earth could only melt when volcanoes emitted high enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to cause\ngreenhouse heating. Some studies estimate that because of the frozen ocean surface, carbon dioxide 350 times higher\nthan today\u2019s concentration was required. Because biological activity did survive, the complete freezing and its extent in the\nsnowball earth hypothesis are controversial. A competing hypothesis is the Slushball Earth hypothesis in which some\nregions of the equatorial ocean remained open. Differing scientific conclusions about the stability of Earth\u2019s magnetic poles, GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE | 415\nimpacts on ancient rock evidence from subsequent metamorphism, and alternate interpretations of existing evidence\nkeep the idea of Snowball Earth controversial.\nGlaciations also occurred in the Paleozoic Era, notably the Andean-Saharan glaciation in the late Ordovician, about\n440\u2013460 million years ago, which coincided with a major extinction event, and the Karoo Ice Age during the Pennsylvanian\nPeriod, 323 to 300 million years ago. This glaciation was one of the evidences cited by Wegener for his Continental Drift\nhypothesis as his proposed Pangea drifted into south polar latitudes. The Karoo glaciation was associated with an increase\nof oxygen and a subsequent drop in carbon dioxide, most likely produced by the evolution and rise of land plants.\nDuring the Cenozoic Era\u2014the last 65 million years, cli-\nmate started out warm and gradually cooled to today. This\nwarm time is called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Max-\nimum, and Antarctica and Greenland were ice free during\nthis time. Since the Eocene, tectonic events during the\nCenozoic Era caused the planet to persistently and signifi-\ncantly cool. For example, the Indian Plate and Asian Plate\ncollided, creating the Himalaya Mountains, which\nincreased the rate of weathering and erosion of silicate\nminerals, especially feldspar. Increased weathering con-\nsumes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which\nreduces the greenhouse effect, resulting in long-term\nFigure 15.13: Global average surface temperature over the past 65\nmillion years. cooling.\nAbout 40 million years ago, the narrow gap between the\nSouth American Plate and the Antarctica Plate widened,\nwhich opened the Drake Passage. This opening allowed\nthe water around Antarctica\u2014the Antarctic Circumpolar\nCurrent\u2014to flow unrestrictedly west-to-east, which effec-\ntively isolated the southern ocean from the warmer waters\nof the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The region\ncooled significantly, and by 35 million years ago, during the\nOligocene Epoch, glaciers had started to form on Antarc-\ntica.\nAround 15 million years ago, subduction-related volcanos\nbetween Central and South America created the Isthmus\nof Panama, which connected North and South America.\nThis prevented water from flowing between the Pacific and\nAtlantic Oceans and reduced heat transfer from the tropics\nto the poles. This reduced heat transfer created a cooler\nAntarctica and larger Antarctic glaciers. As a result, the ice\nsheet expanded on land and water, increased Earth\u2019s\nreflectivity and enhanced the albedo effect, which created\na positive feedback loop: more reflective glacial ice, Figure 15.14: The Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\nmore cooling, more ice, more cooling, and so on.\nBy 5 million years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch, ice sheets had started to grow in North America and northern Europe.\nThe most intense part of the current glaciation is the Pleistocene Epoch\u2019s last 1 million years. The Pleistocene\u2019s temper-\nature varies significantly through a range of almost 10\u00b0C (18\u00b0F) on time scales of 40,000 to 100,000 years, and ice sheets\nexpand and contract correspondingly. These variations are attributed to subtle changes in Earth\u2019s orbital parameters, called 416 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nMilankovitch cycles (see chapter 14). Over the past million years, the glaciation cycles occurred approximately every\n100,000 years, with many glacial advances occurring in the last 2 million years (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005).\nFigure 15.15: A Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic \u03b418O records.\nDuring an ice age, periods of warming climate are called interglacials; during interglacials, very brief periods of even\nwarmer climate are called interstadials. These warming upticks are related to Earth\u2019s climate variations, like Milankovitch\ncycles, which are changes to the Earth\u2019s orbit that can fluctuate climate (see chapter 14). In the last 500,000 years, there\nhave been five or six interglacials, with the most recent belonging to our current time, the Holocene Epoch.\nThe two more recent climate swings, the Younger Dryas and the Holocene Climatic Optimum, demonstrate complex\nchanges. These events are more recent, yet have conflicting information. The Younger Dryas\u2019 cooling is widely recognized\nin the Northern Hemisphere, though the event\u2019s timing, about 12,000 years ago, does not appear to be equal everywhere.\nAlso, it is difficult to find in the Southern Hemisphere. The Holocene Climatic Optimum is a warming around 6,000 years\nago; it was not universally warmer, nor as warm as current warming, and not warm at the same time everywhere.\n15.3.2 Proxy Indicators of Past Climates\nHow do we know about past climates? Geologists use proxy indicators to understand past climate. A proxy indicator is\na biological, chemical, or physical signature preserved in the rock, sediment, or ice record that acts like a fingerprint of\nsomething in the past. Thus, they are an indirect indicator of climate. An indirect indicator of ancient glaciations from the\nProterozoic Eon and Paleozoic Era is the Mineral Fork Formation in Utah, which contains rock formations of glacial sedi-\nments such as diamictite (tillite). This dark rock has many fine-grained components plus some large out-sized clasts like\na modern glacial till. GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE | 417\nDeep-sea sediment is an indirect indicator of climate change during the Cenozoic Era, about the last 65 million years.\nResearchers from the Ocean Drilling Program, an international research collaboration, collect deep-sea sediment cores\nthat record continuous sediment accumulation. The sediment provides detailed chemical records of stable carbon and\noxygen isotopes obtained from deep-sea benthic foraminifera shells that accumulated on the ocean floor over millions of\nyears. The oxygen isotopes are a proxy indicator of deep-sea temperatures and continental ice volume.\nSediment Cores\u2014Stable Oxygen Isotopes\nHow do oxygen isotopes indicate past climate? The two main stable oxygen iso-\ntopes are 16O and 18O. They both occur in water (H2O) and in the calcium carbon-\nate (CaCO3) shells of foraminifera as both of those substances\u2019 oxygen\ncomponent. The most abundant and lighter isotope is 16O. Since it is lighter, it\nevaporates more readily from the ocean\u2019s surface as water vapor, which later turns\nto clouds and precipitation on the ocean and land. This evaporation is enhanced\nin warmer sea water and slightly increases the concentration of 18O in the surface\nseawater from which the plankton derives the carbonate for its shells. Thus the\nratio of 16O and 18O in the fossilized shells in seafloor sediment is a proxy indica-\ntor of the temperature and evaporation of seawater.\nKeep in mind, it is\nFigure 15.16: Sediment core from the harder to evapo-\nGreenland continental slope. rate the heavier\nwater and easier\nto condense it. As evaporated water vapor drifts toward the\npoles and tiny droplets form clouds and precipitation,\ndroplets of water with 18O tend to form more readily than\ndroplets of the lighter form and precipitate out, leaving the\ndrifting vapor depleted in 18O. During geologic times when\nthe climate is cooler, more of this lighter precipitation that\nfalls on land is locked in the form of glacial ice. Consider\nthat the giant ice sheets were more than a mile thick and\ncovered a large part of North America during the last ice\nFigure 15.17: Antarctic temperature changes during the last few\nage only 14,000 years ago. During glaciation, the glaciers glaciations compared to global ice volume.

The sedi-\nment cores from the Ocean Drilling Program record a continuous accumulation of these fossils in the sediment and pro-\nvide a record of glacials, interglacials and interstadials.\nSediment Cores\u2014Boron\u2013Isotopes and Acidity\nOcean acidity is affected by carbonic acid and is a proxy for past atmospheric CO2 concentrations. To estimate the ocean\u2019s\npH (acidity) over the past 60 million years, researchers collected deep-sea sediment cores and examined the ancient\nplanktonic foraminifera shells\u2019 boron-isotope ratios. Boron has two isotopes: 11B and 10B. In aqueous compounds of boron,\nthe relative abundance of these two isotopes is sensitive to pH (acidity), hence CO2 concentrations. In the early Ceno-\nzoic, around 60 million years ago, CO2 concentrations were over 2,000 ppm, higher pH, and started falling around 55\nto 40 million years ago, with noticeable drop in pH, indicated by boron isotope ratios. The drop was possibly due to\nreduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts, and increased carbon burial due to sub-\nduction and the Himalaya Mountains uplift. By the Miocene Epoch, about 24 million years ago, CO2 levels were below 500\nppm, and by 800,000 years ago, CO2 levels didn\u2019t exceed 300 ppm. 418 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nCarbon Dioxide Concentrations in Ice Cores\nFor the recent Pleistocene Epoch\u2019s climate, researchers get\na more detailed and direct chemical record of the last\n800,000 years by extracting and analyzing ice cores from the\nAntarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Snow accumulates on\nthese ice sheets and creates yearly layers. Oxygen iso-\ntopes are collected from these annual layers, and the ratio\nof 18O to 16O (\u2bd118O) is used to determine temperature as\ndiscussed above. In addition, the ice contains small bubbles\nof atmospheric gas as the snow turns to ice. Analysis of these\nFigure 15.18: 19 cm long section of ice core showing 11 annual layers bubbles reveals the composition of the atmosphere at\nwith summer layers (arrowed) sandwiched between darker winter\nthese previous times.\nlayers.\nSmall pieces of this ice are crushed, and the ancient air is\nextracted into a mass spectrometer that can detect the\nancient atmosphere\u2019s chemistry. Carbon dioxide levels are recre-\nated from these measurements. Over the last 800,000 years, the\nmaximum carbon dioxide concentration during warm times was\nabout 300 parts per million (ppm), and the minimum was about\n170 ppm during cold stretches. Currently, the earth\u2019s atmos-\npheric carbon dioxide content is over 410 ppm.\nFigure 15.19: Antarctic ice showing hundreds of tiny trapped air\nbubbles from the atmosphere thousands of years ago.\nFigure 15.20: Composite carbon dioxide record from last 800,000 years\nbased on ice core data from EPICA Dome C Ice Core.\nOceanic Microfossils\nMicrofossils, like foraminifera, diatoms, and radiolarians can be used as a proxy to interpret past climate record.

Microfossil groups are called assemblages and\ntheir composition differs depending on the climatic conditions when they lived. One assemblage consists of species that\nlived in cooler ocean water, such as in glacial times, and at a different level in the same sediment core, another assem-\nblage consists of species that lived in warmer waters.

Flowering plants pro-\nduce pollen grains. Pollen grains are distinctive when viewed\nunder a microscope. Sometimes, pollen is preserved in lake sed-\niments that accumulate in layers every year. Lake-sediment\ncores can reveal ancient pollen. Fossil-pollen assemblages are\npollen groups from multiple species, such as spruce, pine, and\noak. Through time, via the sediment cores and radiometric age-\ndating techniques, the pollen assemblages change, revealing\nthe plants that lived in the area at the time. Thus, the pollen\nassemblages are a past climate indicator, since different plants\nwill prefer different climates. For example, in the Pacific North-\nwest, east of the Cascades in a region close to grassland and for-\nest borders, scientists tracked pollen over the last 125,000 years,\ncovering the last two glaciations.

The cli-\nmate changes observed today are rapid and largely human caused. Evidence shows that climate is changing, but what is\ncausing that change? Since the late 1800s, scientists have suspected that human-produced, i.e. anthropogenic changes\nin atmospheric greenhouse gases would likely cause climate change because changes in these gases have been the\ncase every time in the geologic past. By the middle 1900s, scientists began conducting systematic measurements, which\nconfirmed that human-produced carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere and other earth systems, such\nas forests and oceans. By the end of the 1900s and into the early 2000s, scientists solidified the Theory of Anthro-\npogenic Climate Change when evidence from thousands of ground-based studies and continuous land and ocean satellite\nmeasurements mounted, revealing the expected temperature increase. The Theory of Anthropogenic Climate Change GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE | 421\nis that humans are causing most of the current climate changes by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\nTheories evolve and transform as new data and new techniques become available, and they represent a particular field\u2019s\nstate of thinking. This section summarizes the scientific consensus of anthropogenic climate change.\n15.4.1 Scientific Consensus\nThe overwhelming majority of climate studies indicate that human activity is causing rapid changes to the climate, which\nwill cause severe environmental damage. There is strong scientific consensus on the issue. Studies published in peer-\nreviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate warming is caused from human\nactivities. There is no alternative explanation for the observed link between human-produced greenhouse gas emissions\nand changing modern climate. Most leading scientific organizations endorse this position, including the U.S. National Acad-\nemy of Science, which was established in 1863 by an act of Congress under President Lincoln. Congress charged the\nNational Academy of Science \u201cwith providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science\nand technology.\u201d Therefore, the National Academy of Science is the leading authority when it comes to policy advice\nrelated to scientific issues.\nOne way we know that the increased greenhouse gas emissions are from human activities is with isotopic fingerprints. For\nexample, fossil fuels, representing plants that lived millions of years ago, have a stable carbon-13 to carbon-12 (13C/12C)\nratio that is different from today\u2019s atmospheric stable-carbon ratio (radioactive 14C is unstable). Isotopic carbon signatures\nhave been used to identify anthropogenic carbon in the atmosphere since the 1980s. Isotopic records from the Antarctic\nIce Sheet show stable isotopic signatures from ~1000 AD to ~1800 AD and a steady isotopic signature gradually changing\nsince 1800, followed by a more rapid change after 1950 as burning of fossil fuels dilutes the CO2 in the atmosphere. These\nchanges show the atmosphere as having a carbon isotopic signature increasingly more similar to that of fossil fuels.\n15.4.2 Anthropogenic Sources of Greenhouse Gases\nFigure 15.24: Total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr)\nfrom economic sectors in 2010. The circle shows the shares of direct GHG emissions (in % of total anthropogenic\nGHG emissions) from five economic sectors in 2010. The pull-out shows how shares of indirect CO2 emissions (in %\nof total anthropogenic GHG emissions) from electricity and heat production are attributed to sectors of final energy\nuse. 422 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nAnthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have increased since pre-industrial times due to global economic growth\nand population growth. Atmospheric concentrations of the leading greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, are at unprecedented\nlevels that haven\u2019t been observed in at least the last 800,000 years. Pre-industrial level of carbon dioxide was at about\n278 parts per million (ppm). As of 2016, carbon dioxide was, for the first time, above 400 ppm for the entirety of the year.\nMeasurements of atmospheric carbon at the Mauna Loa Carbon Dioxide Observatory show a continuous increase since\n1957 when the observatory was established from 315 ppm to over 417 ppm in 2022. The daily reading today can be seen at\nDaily CO2. Based on the ice core record over the past 800,000 years, carbon dioxide ranged from about 185 ppm during\nice ages to 300 ppm during warm times. View the data-accurate NOAA animation below of carbon dioxide trends over the\nlast 800,000 years.\nWhat is the source of these anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions? Fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes\ncontributed 78 percent of all emissions since 1970. The economic sectors responsible for most of this include electricity\nand heat production (25 percent); agriculture, forestry, and land use (24 percent); industry (21 percent); transportation,\nincluding automobiles (14 percent); other energy production (9.6 percent); and buildings (6.4 percent). More than half of\ngreenhouse gas emissions have occurred in the last 40 years, and 40 percent of these emissions have stayed in the atmos-\nphere. Unfortunately, despite scientific consensus, efforts to mitigate climate change require political action. Despite grow-\ning climate change concern, mitigation efforts, legislation, and international agreements have reduced emissions in some\nplaces, yet the less developed world\u2019s continual economic growth has increased global greenhouse gas emissions. In fact,\nthe years 2000 to 2010 saw the largest increases since 1970.\nFigure 15.25: Annual global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year (GtCO2/yr) from fossil fuel\ncombustion, cement production and flaring, and forestry and other land use (FOLU), 1750\u20132011.

Recent changes in atmospheric temperature and climate over intervals of decades have been observed. For\nEarth\u2019s climate to be stable, incoming radiation from the sun and outgoing radiation from the sun-warmed Earth must be in\nbalance. Gases in the atmosphere called greenhouse gases absorb the infrared thermal radiation from the Earth\u2019s surface,\ntrapping that heat and warming the atmosphere, a process called the Greenhouse Effect. Thus the energy budget is not\nnow in balance and the Earth is warming. Human activity produces many greenhouse gases that have accelerated climate\nchange. CO2 from fossil fuel burning is one of the major ones. While atmospheric composition is mostly nitrogen and\noxygen, trace components including the greenhouse gases (CO2 and methane are the major ones and there are others)\nhave the greatest effect on global warming.\nA number of Positive Feedback Mechanisms, processes whose results reinforce the original process, take place in the\nEarth system. An example of a PFM of great concern is permafrost melting which causes decay of melting organic mate-\nrial that produces CO2 and methane (both powerful greenhouse gases) that warm the atmosphere and promote more\npermafrost melting. Two carbon cycles affect Earth\u2019s atmospheric CO2 composition, the biologic carbon cycle and the\ngeologic carbon cycle. In the biologic cycle, organisms (mostly plants and also animals that eat them) remove CO2 from\nthe atmosphere for energy and to build their body tissues and return it to the atmosphere when they die and decay. The\nbiologic cycle is a rapid cycle. In the geologic cycle, some organic matter is preserved in the form of petroleum and coal\nwhile more is dissolved in seawater and captured in carbonate sediments, some of which is subducted into the mantle\nand returned by volcanic activity. The geologic carbon cycle is slow over geologic time.\nMeasurements of increasing atmospheric temperature have been made since the nineteenth century but the upward\ntemperature trend itself increased in the mid twentieth century showing the current trend is exponential. Because of the\nhigh specific heat of water, the oceans have absorbed most of the added heat. That this is temporary storage is revealed by\nthe record-breaking warm years of the recent decade and the increase in intense storms and hurricanes. In 1957 the Mauna\nLoa CO2 Observatory was established in Hawaii providing constant measurements of atmospheric CO2 since 1958. The\ninitial value was 315 ppm. The Keeling curve, named for the observatory founder, shows that value has steadily increased,\nexponentially, to over 417 ppm now. Compared to proxy data from atmospheric gases trapped in ice cores that show a\nmaximum value for CO2 of about 300 ppm over the last 800,000 years, the Keeling increase of over 100 ppm in 50 years\nis dramatic evidence of human caused CO2 increase and climate change! As Earth\u2019s temperature rises, glaciers and ice\nsheets are shrinking resulting in sea level rise. Atmospheric CO2 is also absorbed in sea water producing increased con-\ncentrations of carbonic acid which is raising the pH of the oceans making it harder for marine life to extract carbonate for\ntheir skeletal materials. 424 | GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nEarth\u2019s climate has changed over geologic time with periods of major glaciations. There was a high temperature period\nin the Mesozoic shown by fossils in high latitudes and the Western Interior Seaway covering what is now the Midwest. How-\never, climate has been cooling during the Cenozoic culminating in the Ice Age. Since the Ice Age, several proxy indicators\nof ancient climate show that the rate and amount of current climate change is unique in geologic history and can only be\nattributed to human activity. Those who ignore the consequences of increasing global warming for our planet\u2019s future do\nso at the peril of our posterity!\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 15 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Maybe stones\nwere first used as curiosity pieces, maybe as weapons, but ultimately, they\nwere used as tools. This was the Paleolithic Period, the beginning of geo-\nlogic study, and it dates back 2.6 million years to east Africa.\nIn modern times, geologic knowledge is important for locating economi-\ncally valuable materials for society\u2019s use. In fact, all things we use come\nfrom only three sources: they are farmed, hunted or fished, or mined. At\nthe turn of the twentieth century, speculation was rampant that food sup-\nplies would not keep pace with world demand, suggesting the need to\nFigure 16.1: A Mode 1 Oldowan tool used for chopping.\ndevelop artificial fertilizers. Sources of fertilizer ingredients are: nitrogen is\nprocessed from the atmosphere, using the Haber process for the manufacture of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen\nand hydrogen; potassium comes from the hydrosphere, such as lakes or ocean evaporation; and phosphorus is mined\nfrom the lithosphere, such as minerals like apatite from phosphorite rock, which is found in Florida, North Carolina, Idaho,\nUtah, and around the world. Thus, without mining and processing of natural materials, modern civilization would not exist.\nIndeed, geologists are essential in this process. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 429\n16.1 Mining\nFigure 16.2: Map of world mining areas.\nMining is defined as extracting valuable materials from the Earth for society\u2019s use. Usually, these include solid materials\nsuch as gold, iron, coal, diamond, sand, and gravel, but materials can also include fluid resources such as oil and natural\ngas. Modern mining has a long relationship with modern society. The oldest mine dates back 40,000 years to the Lion\nCavern in Swaziland where there is evidence of concentrated digging into the Earth for hematite, an important iron ore\nused as red dye. Resources extracted by mining are generally considered to be nonrenewable.\n16.1.1 Renewable versus Nonrenewable Resources\nResources generally come in two major categories: renewable and nonrenewable. Renewable resources can be reused\nover and over or their availability replicated over a short human life span; nonrenewable resources cannot.\nRenewable resources are materials present in our environ-\nment that can be exploited and replenished. Some common\nrenewable energy sources are linked with green energy\nsources because they are associated with relatively small or\neasily remediated environmental impact. For example, solar\nenergy comes from fusion within the Sun, which radiates elec-\ntromagnetic energy. This energy reaches the Earth constantly\nand consistently and should continue to do so for about five\nbillion more years. Wind energy, also related to solar energy, is\nmaybe the oldest renewable energy and is used to sail ships\nand power windmills. Both solar and wind-generated energy\nare variable on Earth\u2019s surface. These limitations are offset\nFigure 16.3: Hoover Dam provides hydroelectric energy and stores\nbecause we can use energy storing devices, such as batteries\nwater for southern Nevada.\nor electricity exchanges between producing sites. The Earth\u2019s\nheat, known as geothermal energy, can be viable anywhere that geologists drill deeply enough. In practice, geothermal\nenergy is more useful where heat flow is great, such as volcanic zones or regions with a thinner crust. Hydroelectric dams\nprovide energy by allowing water to fall through the dam under gravity, which activates turbines that produce the energy.\nOcean tides are also a reliable energy source. All of these renewable resources provide energy that powers society. Other\nrenewable resources are plant and animal matter, which are used for food, clothing, and other necessities, but are being\nresearched as possible energy sources. 430 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\nNonrenewable resources cannot be replenished at a sustainable rate. They\nare finite within human time frames. Many nonrenewable resources come\nfrom planetary, tectonic, or long-term biologic processes and include\nmaterials such as gold, lead, copper, diamonds, marble, sand, natural gas,\noil, and coal. Most nonrenewable resources include specific concentrated\nelements listed on the periodic table; some are compounds of those ele-\nments. For example, if society needs iron (Fe) sources, then an exploration\ngeologist will search for iron-rich deposits that can be economically\nextracted. Nonrenewable resources may be abandoned when other mate-\nrials become cheaper or serve a better purpose. For example, coal is abun-\ndantly available in England and other nations, but because oil and natural\ngas are available at a lower cost and lower environmental impact, coal use Figure 16.4: Natural, octahedral shape of diamond.\nhas decreased. Economic competition among nonrenewable resources is\nshifting use away from coal in many developed countries.\n16.1.2 Ore\nEarth\u2019s materials include the periodic table elements. However, it is rare\nthat these elements are concentrated to the point where it is profitable to\nextract and process the material into usable products. Any place where a\nvaluable material is concentrated is a geologic and geochemical anomaly.\nA body of material from which one or more valuable substances can be\nmined at a profit, is called an ore deposit. Typically, the term ore is used for\nonly metal-bearing minerals, but it can be applied to valuable nonrenew-\nable resource concentrations such as fossil fuels, building stones, and\nother nonmetal deposits, even groundwater. If a metal-bearing resource is\nnot profitable to mine, it is referred to as a mineral deposit. The term nat-\nural resource is more common than the term ore for non-metal-bearing Figure 16.5: Banded-iron formations are an\nmaterials. important ore of iron (Fe).\nIt is implicit that the technology to mine is available, economic conditions are\nsuitable, and political, social and environmental considerations are satisfied in\norder to classify a natural resource deposit as ore. Depending on the sub-\nstance, it can be concentrated in a narrow vein or distributed over a large area\nas a low-concentration ore. Some materials are mined directly from bodies of\nwater (e.g. sylvite for potassium; water through desalination) and the atmos-\nphere (e.g. nitrogen for fertilizers). These differences lead to various methods of\nmining, and differences in terminology depending on the certainty. Ore mineral\nresource is used for an indication of ore that is potentially extractable, and the\nterm ore mineral reserve is used for a well defined (proven), profitable amount\nFigure 16.6: Diagram illustrating the relative of extractable ore.\nabundance of proven reserves, inferred\nreserves, resources, and undiscovered\nresources. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 431\nFigure 16.7: McKelvey diagram showing different definitions for different degrees of concentration and understanding of mineral deposits.\n16.1.3 Mining Techniques\nThe mining style is determined by technology, social license, and economics. It is in the best interest of the company\nextracting the resources to do so in a cost-effective way. Fluid resources, such as oil and gas, are extracted by drilling wells\nand pumping. Over the years, drilling has evolved into a complex discipline in which directional drilling can produce multi-\nple bifurcations and curves originating from a single drill collar at the surface. Using geophysical tools like seismic imaging,\ngeologists can pinpoint resources and extract efficiently.\nSolid resources are extracted by two principal methods of which there are many variants. Surface mining is used to\nremove material from the outermost part of the Earth. Open pit mining is used to target shallow, broadly disseminated\nresources.\nOpen pit mining requires careful study of the ore body through sur-\nface mapping and drilling exploratory cores. The pit is progressively\ndeepened through additional mining cuts to extract the ore. Typi-\ncally, the pit\u2019s walls are as steep as can be safely managed. Once\nthe pit is deepened, widening the top is very expensive. A steep\nwall is thus an engineering balance between efficient and profitable\nmining (from the company\u2019s point of view) and mass wasting\n(angle of repose from a safety p0int of view) so that there is less\nwaste to remove. The waste is called non-valuable rock or overbur-\nden and moving it is costly. Occasionally, landslides do occur, such\nFigure 16.8: Bingham Canyon Mine, Utah. This open pit mine\nas the very large landslide in the Kennecott Bingham Canyon mine,\nis the largest man-made removal of rock in the world.\nUtah, in 2013. These events are costly and dangerous. The job of\nengineering geologists is to carefully monitor the mine; when company management heeds their warnings, there is ample\ntime and action to avoid or prepare for any slide. 432 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\nStrip mining and mountaintop mining are surface min-\ning techniques that are used to mine resources that cover large\nareas, especially layered resources, such as coal. In this\nmethod, an entire mountaintop or rock layer is removed to\naccess the ore below. Surface mining\u2019s environmental impacts\nare usually much greater due to the large surface footprint that\u2019s\ndisturbed.\nFigure 16.9: A surface coal mine in Wyoming.\nUnderground mining is a method often used to mine\nhigher-grade, more localized, or very concentrated\nresources. For one example, geologists mine some under-\nground ore minerals by introducing chemical agents,\nwhich dissolve the target mineral. Then, they bring the\nsolution to the surface where precipitation extracts the\nmaterial. But more often, a mining shaft tunnel or a large Figure 16.10: Underground mining in Estonia of oil shale.\nnetwork of these shafts and tunnels is dug to access the\nmaterial. The decision to mine underground or from Earth\u2019s surface is dictated by the ore deposit\u2019s concentration, depth,\ngeometry, land-use policies, economics, surrounding rock strength, and physical access to the ore. For example, to use\nsurface mining techniques for deeper deposits might require removing too much material, or the necessary method may\nbe too dangerous or impractical, or removing the entire overburden may be too expensive, or the mining footprint would\nbe too large. These factors may prevent geologists from surface mining materials and cause a project to be mined under-\nground. The mining method and its feasibility depends on the commodity\u2019s price and the cost of the technology needed\nto remove it and deliver it to market. Thus, mines and the towns that support them come and go as the commodity price\nvaries. And, conversely, technological advances and market demands may reopen mines and revive ghost towns.\n16.1.4 Concentrating and Refining\nAll ore minerals occur mixed with less desirable components\ncalled gangue. The process of physically separating gangue miner-\nals from ore bearing minerals is called concentrating. Separating a\ndesired element from a host mineral by chemical means, including\nheating, is called smelting. Finally, taking a metal such as copper and\nremoving other trace metals such as gold or silver is done through the\nrefining process. Typically, refining is done one of three ways: 1. Materi-\nals can either be mechanically separated and processed based on the\nore mineral\u2019s unique physical properties, such as recovering\nplacer gold based on its high density. 2. Materials can be heated to\nchemically separate desired components, such as refin-\ning crude oil into gasoline. 3. Materials can be smelted, in which con-\ntrolled chemical reactions unbind metals from the minerals they are Figure 16.11: A phosphate smelting operation in\nAlabama, 1942.\ncontained in, such as when copper is taken out of chalcopyrite (CuFeS2).\nMining, concentrating, smelting, and refining processes require enor-\nmous energy. Continual advances in metallurgy- and mining-practice strive to develop ever more energy efficient and\nenvironmentally benign processes and practices.

These resources were\noriginally formed via photosynthesis by living organisms\nsuch as plants, phytoplankton, algae, and cyanobacteria.\nThis energy is actually fossil solar energy, since the sun\u2019s\nancient energy was converted by ancient organisms into\ntissues that preserved the chemical energy within the fos-\nsil fuel. Of course, as the energy is used, just like photo-\nsynthetic respiration that occurs today, carbon enters the\natmosphere as CO2, causing climate consequences (see\nchapter 15). Today humanity uses fossil fuels for most of\nFigure 16.12: Coal power plant in Helper, Utah.\nthe world\u2019s energy.\nConverting solar energy by living organisms into hydrocarbon\nfossil fuels is a complex process. As organisms die, they decom-\npose slowly, usually due to being buried rapidly, and the chemi-\ncal energy stored within the organisms\u2019 tissues is buried within\nsurrounding geologic materials. All fossil fuels contain carbon\nthat was produced in an ancient environment. In environments\nrich with organic matter such as swamps, coral reefs, and plank-\ntonic blooms, there is a higher potential for fossil fuels to accu-\nmulate. Indeed, there is some evidence that over geologic time,\norganic hydrocarbon fossil fuel material was highly produced\nglobally. Lack of oxygen and moderate temperatures in the envi-\nronment seem to help preserve these organic substances. Also,\nthe heat and pressure applied to organic material after it is buried\nFigure 16.13: Modern coral reefs and other highly-productive\ncontribute to transforming it into higher quality materials, such as\nshallow marine environments are thought to be the sources of\nbrown coal to anthracite and oil to gas. Heat and pressure can most petroleum resources.\nalso cause mobile materials to migrate to conditions suitable for\nextraction. 434 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\n16.2.1 Oil and Gas\nFigure 16.14: World oil reserves in 2013. Scale in billions of barrels.\nPetroleum is principally derived from organic-rich shallow marine sedimentary deposits where the remains of micro-\norganisms like plankton accumulated in fine grained sediments. Petroleum\u2019s liquid component is called oil, and its gas\ncomponent is called natural gas, which is mostly made up of methane (CH4). As rocks such as shale, mudstone, or lime-\nstone lithify, increasing pressure and temperature cause the oil and gas to be squeezed out and migrate from the source\nrock to a different rock unit higher in the rock column. Similar to the discussion of good aquifers in chapter 11, if that rock is\na sandstone, limestone, or other porous and permeable rock, and involved in a suitable stratigraphic or structural trap-\nping process, then that rock can act as an oil and gas reservoir.\nA trap is a combination of a subsurface geologic structure, a porous and per-\nmeable rock, and an impervious layer that helps block oil and gas from mov-\ning further, which concentrates it for humans to extract later. A trap develops\ndue to many different geologic situations. Examples include an anticline or\ndomal structure, an impermeable salt dome, or a fault bounded strati-\ngraphic block, which is porous rock next to nonporous rock. The different\ntraps have one thing in common: they pool fluid fossil fuels into a configu-\nration in which extracting it is more likely to be profitable. Oil or gas in strata\noutside of a trap renders it less viable to extract.\nFigure 16.15: Examples of different forms of\nhydrocarbon traps: in the core region of anticlines. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 435\nSequence stratigraphy is a branch of geology that studies sedimentary\nfacies both horizontally and vertically and is devoted to understanding how\nsea level changes create organic-rich shallow marine muds, carbonates,\nand sands in areas that are close to each other. For example, shoreline envi-\nronments may have beaches, lagoons, reefs, nearshore and offshore\ndeposits, all next to each other. Beach sand, lagoonal and nearshore muds,\nand coral reef layers accumulate into sediments that include sand-\nstones\u2014good reservoir rocks\u2014 next to mudstones, next to limestones,\nboth of which are potential source rocks. As sea level either rises or falls, the\nshoreline\u2019s location changes, and the sand, mud, and reef locations shift with\nFigure 16.16: The rising sea levels of transgressions\nit (see the figure). This places oil and gas producing rocks, such as mud-\ncreate onlapping sediments, regressions create\nofflapping. stones and limestones next to oil and gas reservoirs, such as sandstones and\nsome limestones. Understanding how the lithology and the facies/strati-\ngraphic relationships interplay is very important in finding new petroleum resources. Using sequence stratigraphy as a\nmodel allows geologists to predict favorable locations of the source rock and reservoir.\n16.2.2 Tar Sands\nConventional oil and gas, which is pumped from a reservoir, is not the only\nway to obtain hydrocarbons. There are a few fuel sources known as uncon-\nventional petroleum sources. However, they are becoming more important\nas conventional sources become scarce. Tar sands, or oil sands, are sand-\nstones that contain petroleum products that are highly viscous, like tar, and\nthus cannot be drilled and pumped out of the ground readily like conven-\ntional oil. This unconventional fossil fuel is bitumen, which can be pumped\nas a fluid only at very low recovery rates and only when heated or mixed\nwith solvents. So, using steam and solvent injections or directly mining tar\nsands to process later are ways to extract the tar from the sands. Alberta,\nCanada is known to have the largest tar sand reserves in the world. Note: as\nwith ores, an energy resource becomes uneconomic if the total extraction\nand processing costs exceed the extracted material\u2019s sales revenue. Envi-\nronmental costs may also contribute to a resource becoming uneconomic.\nFigure 16.17: Tar sandstone from the Miocene\nMonterrey Formation of California.\n16.2.3 Oil Shale\nOil shale, or tight oil, is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that has sig-\nnificant petroleum or natural gas quantities locked tightly in the sedi-\nment. Shale has high porosity but very low permeability and is a\ncommon fossil fuel source rock. To extract the oil directly from the\nshale, the material has to be mined and heated, which, like with tar\nsands, is expensive and typically has a negative environmental impact.\nFigure 16.18: Global production of oil shale, 1880-2010. 436 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\n16.2.4 Fracking\nAnother process used to extract the oil and gas\nfrom shale and other unconventional tight resources is\ncalled hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking. In\nthis method, high-pressure water, sand grains, and added\nchemicals are injected and pumped underground. Under\nhigh pressure, this creates and holds open fractures in the\nrocks, which help release the hard-to-access mostly nat-\nural gas fluids. Fracking is more useful in tighter sedi-\nments, especially shale, which has a high porosity to store\nthe hydrocarbons but low permeability to allow transmis-\nsion of the hydrocarbons. Fracking has become controver-\nsial because its methods contaminate\nFigure 16.19: Schematic diagram of fracking.\ngroundwater and induce seismic activity. This has created\nmuch controversy between public concerns, political con-\ncerns, and energy value.\n16.2.5 Coal\nCoal comes from fossilized swamps, though some\nolder coal deposits that predate terrestrial plants are pre-\nsumed to come from algal buildups. Coal is chiefly carbon,\nhydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen, with minor\namounts of other elements. As plant material is incorpo-\nrated into sediments, heat and pressure cause several\nchanges that concentrate the fixed carbon, which is the\ncoal\u2019s combustible portion. So, the more heat and pressure\nthat coal undergoes, the greater is its carbon concentra-\ntion and fuel value and the more desirable is the coal.\nThis is the general sequence of a swamp progressing\nthrough the various stages of coal formation and becom-\ning more concentrated in carbon: Swamp => Peat => Lignite\n=> Sub-bituminous => Bituminous => Anthracite => Graphite.\nAs swamp materials collect on the swamp floor and are\nburied under accumulating materials, they first turn to peat.\nFigure 16.20: USGS diagram of different coal rankings. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 437\nPeat itself is an economic fuel in some locations like the British Isles\nand Scandinavia. As lithification occurs, peat turns to lignite. With\nincreasing heat and pressure, lignite turns to sub-bituminous coal,\nbituminous coal, and then, in a process like metamorphism,\nanthracite. Anthracite is the highest metamorphic grade and most\ndesirable coal since it provides the highest energy output. With even\nmore heat and pressure driving out all the volatiles and leaving pure\ncarbon, anthracite can become graphite.\nHumans have used coal for at least\n6,000 years, mainly as a fuel\nsource. Coal resources in Wales\nare often cited as a primary reason\nFigure 16.21: Peat (also known as turf) consists of partially\nfor Britain\u2019s rise, and later, for the decayed organic matter. The Irish have long mined peat to\nUnited States\u2019 rise during the be burned as fuel though this practice is now discouraged\nfor environmental reasons.\nIndustrial Revolution. According to\nthe US Energy Information Administration, US coal production has decreased due to\ncompeting energy sources\u2019 cheaper prices and due to society recognizing its negative\nenvironmental impacts, including increased very fine-grained particulate matter as an\nFigure 16.22: Anthracite coal, the\nair pollutant, greenhouse gases, acid rain, and heavy metal pollution. Seen from this\nhighest grade of coal.\nperspective, the coal industry as a source of fossil energy is unlikely to revive.\nAs the world transitions away from fossil fuels including coal, and manufacturing seeks strong, flexible, and lighter mate-\nrials than steel including carbon fiber for many applications, current research is exploring coal as a source of this carbon.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 16.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Human society has advanced significantly because\nwe\u2019ve developed the knowledge and technologies to yield metal\nfrom the Earth. This knowledge has allowed humans to build the\nmachines, buildings, and monetary systems that dominate our\nworld today. Locating and recovering these metals has been a\nkey facet of geologic study since its inception. Every ele-\nment across the periodic table has specific applications in\nhuman civilization. Metallic mineral mining is the source of\nmany of these elements.\nFigure 16.23: Gold-bearing quartz vein from California.\n16.3.1 Types of Metallic Mineral Deposits\nThe various ways in which minerals and their associated elements concentrate to form ore deposits are too complex and\nnumerous to fully review in this text. However, entire careers are built around them. In the following section, we describe\nsome of the more common deposit types along with their associated elemental concentrations and world class occur-\nrences.\nMagmatic Processes\nWhen a magmatic body crystallizes and differentiates (see chapter 4), it\ncan cause certain minerals and elements to concentrate. Layered intru-\nsions, typically ultramafic to mafic, can host deposits that contain cop-\nper, nickel, platinum, palladium, rhodium, and chromium. The Stillwater\nComplex in Montana is an example of economic quantities of layered\nmafic intrusion. Associated deposit types can contain chromium or tita-\nnium-vanadium. The largest magmatic deposits in the world are the\nchromite deposits in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa.\nThese rocks have an areal extent larger than the state of Utah. The\nchromite occurs in layers, which resemble sedimentary layers, except\nthese layers occur within a crystallizing magma chamber.\nFigure 16.24: Layered intrusion of dark\nWater and other volatiles that are chromium-bearing minerals, Bushveld Complex, South\nAfrica.\nnot incorporated into mineral\ncrystals when a magma crystal-\nlizes can become concentrated around the crystallizing magma\u2019s margins. Ions in\nthese hot fluids are very mobile and can form exceptionally large crystals. Once\ncrystallized, these large crystal masses are then called pegmatites. They form from\nmagma fluids that are expelled from the solidifying magma when nearly the entire\nmagma body has crystallized. In addition to minerals that are predominant in the\nFigure 16.25: This pegmatite contains\nlithium-rich green elbaite (a tourmaline) main igneous mass, such as quartz, feldspar, and mica, pegmatite bodies may\nand purple lepidolite (a mica). also contain very large crystals of unusual minerals that contain rare elements like\nberyllium, lithium, tantalum, niobium, and tin, as well as native elements like gold.\nSuch pegmatites are ores of these metals. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 439\nAn unusual magmatic process is a kimberlite pipe, which is a\nvolcanic conduit that transports ultramafic magma from within\nthe mantle to the surface. Diamonds, which are formed at great\ntemperatures and pressures of depth, are transported by a Kim-\nberlite pipe to locations where they can be mined. The process\nthat created these kimberlite ultramafic rocks is no longer com-\nmon on Earth. Most known deposits are from the Archean Eon.\nFigure 16.26: Schematic diagram of a kimberlite pipe.\nHydrothermal Processes\nFigure 16.27: The complex chemistry around mid-ocean ridges.\nFluids rising from crystallizing magmatic bodies or that are heated by the geothermal gradient cause many geochemical\nreactions that form various mineral deposits. The most active hydrothermal process today produces volcanogenic mas-\nsive sulfide (VMS) deposits, which form from black smoker hydrothermal chimney activity near mid-ocean ridges all\nover the world. They commonly contain copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver when found at the surface. Evidence from\naround 7000 BC in a period known as the Chalcolithic shows copper was among the earliest metals smelted by humans as\nmeans of obtaining higher temperatures were developed. The largest of these VMS deposits occur in Precambrian period\nrocks. The Jerome deposit in central Arizona is a good example. 440 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\nAnother deposit type that draws on magma-heated water is a porphyry deposit. This is not to be confused with the por-\nphyritic igneous texture, although the name is derived from the porphyritic texture that is nearly always present in the\nigneous rocks associated with a porphyry deposit. Several types of porphyry deposits exist, such as porphyry copper,\nporphyry molybdenum, and porphyry tin. These deposits contain low-grade disseminated ore minerals closely associ-\nated with intermediate and felsic intrusive rocks that are present over a very large area. Porphyry deposits are typically\nthe largest mines on Earth. One of the largest, richest, and possibly best studied mine in the world is Utah\u2019s Kennecott\nBingham Canyon Mine. It\u2019s an open pit mine, which, for over 100 years, has produced several elements including copper,\ngold, molybdenum, and silver. Underground carbonate replacement deposits produce lead, zinc, gold, silver, and copper.\nIn the mine\u2019s past, the open pit predominately produced copper and gold from chalcopyrite and bornite. Gold only occurs\nin minor quantities in the copper-bearing minerals, but because the Kennecott Bingham Canyon Mine produces on such\na large scale, it is one of the largest gold mines in the US. In the future, this mine may produce more copper and molyb-\ndenum (molybdenite) from deeper underground mines.\nMost porphyry copper deposits owe their high metal content, and\nhence, their economic value to weathering processes called super-\ngene enrichment which occurs when the deposit is uplifted,\neroded, and exposed to oxidation. This process occurred millions of\nyears after the initial igneous intrusion and hydrothermal expulsion\nends. When the deposit\u2019s upper pyrite-rich portion is exposed to\nrain, the pyrite in the oxidizing zone creates an extremely acid con-\ndition that dissolves copper out of copper minerals, such as chal-\ncopyrite, and converts the chalcopyrite to iron oxides, such as\nhematite or goethite. The copper minerals are carried downward\nin water until they arrive at the groundwater table and an environ-\nFigure 16.28: The Morenci porphyry is oxidized toward its top\nment where the primary copper minerals are converted into sec-\n(as seen as red rocks in the wall of the mine), creating\nondary higher-copper content minerals. Chalcopyrite (35% Cu) is supergene enrichment.\nconverted to bornite (63% Cu), and ultimately, chalcocite (80%\nCu). Without this enriched zone, which is two to five times higher in copper content than the main deposit, most por-\nphyry copper deposits would not be economic to mine.\nIf limestone or other calcareous sedimentary rocks are near the magmatic body, then\nanother type of ore deposit called a skarn deposit forms. These metamorphic rocks\nform as magma-derived, highly saline metalliferous fluids react with carbonate rocks\nto create calcium-magnesium-silicate minerals like pyroxene, amphibole, and gar-\nnet, as well as high-grade iron, copper, zinc minerals, and gold. Intrusions that are\ngenetically related to the intrusion that made the Kennecott Bingham Canyon deposit\nhave also produced copper-gold skarns, which were mined by the early European\nsettlers in Utah. When iron and/or sulfide deposits undergo metamorphism,\nthe grain size commonly increases, which makes separating the gangue from the\nFigure 16.29: Garnet-augite skarn from desired sulfide or oxide minerals much easier.\nItaly. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 441\nSediment-hosted disseminated gold deposits consist of low concentrations of\nmicroscopic gold as inclusions and disseminated atoms in pyrite crystals. These\nare formed via low-grade hydrothermal reactions, generally in the realm of dia-\ngenesis, that occur in certain rock types, namely muddy carbonates and limey\nmudstones. This hydrothermal alteration is generally far removed from a\nmagma source, but can be found in rocks situated with a high geothermal gra-\ndient. The Mercur deposit in Utah\u2019s Oquirrh Mountains was this type\u2019s earliest\nlocally mined deposit. There, almost a million ounces of gold was recovered\nbetween 1890 and 1917. In the 1960s, a metallurgical process using cyanide was\ndeveloped for these low-grade ore types. These deposits are also called Car-\nlin-type deposits because the disseminated deposit near Carlin, Nevada, is\nFigure 16.30: In this rock, a pyrite cube has\nwhere the new technology was first applied and where the first definitive scien-\ndissolved (as seen with the negative \u201ccorner\u201d\nimpression in the rock), leaving behind small tific studies were conducted. Gold was introduced into these deposits by\nspecks of gold.\nhydrothermal fluids that reacted with silty calcareous rocks, removing carbon-\nate, creating additional permeability, and adding silica and gold-bearing pyrite\nin the pore space between grains. The Betze-Post mine and the Gold Quarry mine on the Carlin Trend are two of the largest\ndisseminated gold deposits in Nevada. Similar deposits, but not as large, have been found in China, Iran, and Macedonia.\nNon-magmatic Geochemical Processes\nGeochemical processes that occur at or near the surface without\nmagma\u2019s aid also concentrate metals, but to a lesser degree\nthan hydrothermal processes. One of the main reactions is redox, short\nfor reduction/oxidation chemistry, which has to do with the amount of\navailable oxygen in a system. Places where oxygen is plentiful, as in the\natmosphere today, are considered oxidizing environments, while oxygen-\npoor places are considered reducing environments. Uranium deposits are\nan example of where redox concentrated the metal. Uranium is soluble in\noxidizing groundwater environments and precipitates as uraninite when\nencountering reducing conditions. Many of the deposits across the Col-\norado Plateau, such as in Moab, Utah, were formed by this method.\nFigure 16.31: Underground uranium mine near Moab,\nRedox reactions are also responsible for creating banded iron forma-\nUtah.\ntions (BIFs), which are interbedded layers of iron oxide\u2014hematite and\nmagnetite, chert, and shale beds. These deposits formed early in the Earth\u2019s history as the atmosphere was becoming\noxygenated. Cycles of oxygenating iron-rich waters initiated precipitation of the iron beds. Because BIFs are gener-\nally Precambrian in age, happening at the event of atmospheric oxygenation, they are only found in some of the older\nexposed rocks in the United States, such as in Michigan\u2019s upper peninsula and northeast Minnesota. 442 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\nFigure 16.32: Map of Mississippi-Valley type ore deposits.\nDeep, saline, connate fluids (trapped in pore spaces) within sedimentary basins may be highly metalliferous. When\nexpelled outward and upward as basin sediments compacted, these fluids formed lead and zinc deposits in limestone by\nreplacing or filling open spaces, such as caves and faults, and in sandstone by filling pore spaces. The most famous are\ncalled Mississippi Valley-type deposits. Also known as carbonate-hosted replacement deposits, they are large deposits\nof galena and sphalerite lead and zinc ores that form from hot fluids ranging from 100\u00b0C to 200\u00b0C (212\u00b0F to 392\u00b0F). Although\nthey are named for occurring along the Mississippi River Valley in the US, they are found worldwide.\nSediment-hosted copper deposits occurring in sandstones, shales, and marls are enormous, and their contained\nresources are comparable to porphyry copper deposits. These deposits were most likely formed diagenetically\nby groundwater fluids in highly permeable rocks. Well-known examples are the Kupferschiefer in Europe, which has an\nareal coverage of >500,000 Km2, (310,685.596mi) and the Zambian Copper Belt in Africa.\nSoils and mineral deposits that are exposed at the surface experience\ndeep and intense weathering, which can form surficial deposits. Baux-\nite, an aluminum ore, is preserved in karst topography and laterites,\nwhich are soils formed in wet tropical environments. Soils containing\naluminum concentrate minerals, such as feldspar, and ferromagnesian\nminerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks, undergo chemical\nweathering processes that concentrate the metals. Ultramafic rocks\nthat undergo weathering form nickel-rich soils, and when the mag-\nnetite and hematite in banded iron formations undergo weathering, it\nforms goethite, a friable mineral that is easily mined for its iron content.\nFigure 16.33: A sample of bauxite. Note the\nunweathered igneous rock in the center. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 443\nSurficial Physical Processes\nAt the Earth\u2019s surface, mass wasting and moving water can cause\nhydraulic sorting, which forces high-density minerals to concentrate.\nWhen these minerals are concentrated in streams, rivers, and beaches,\nthey are called placer deposits, and occur in modern sands and ancient\nlithified rocks. Native gold, native platinum, zircon, ilmenite, rutile, mag-\nnetite, diamonds, and other gemstones can be found in placers. Humans\nhave mimicked this natural process to recover gold manually by gold\npanning and by mechanized means such as dredging.\n16.3.2 Environmental Impacts of Metallic Mineral\nMining\nFigure 16.34: Lithified heavy mineral sand (dark layers)\nfrom a beach deposit in India.\nMetallic mineral min-\ning\u2019s primary impact comes from the mining itself, including disturbing the land\nsurface, covering landscapes with tailings impoundments, and increasing mass\nwasting by accelerating erosion. In addition, many metal deposits contain\npyrite, an uneconomic sulfide mineral, that when placed on waste dumps,\ngenerates acid rock drainage (ARD) during weathering. In oxygenated water,\nsulfides such as pyrite react and undergo complex reactions to release metal\nions and hydrogen ions, which lowers pH to highly acidic levels. Mining and\nprocessing of mined materials typically increase the surface area to volume\nratio in the material, causing chemical reactions to occur even faster than would\nFigure 16.35: Acid mine drainage in the Rio occur naturally. If not managed properly, these reactions lead to acidic streams\nTinto, Spain. and groundwater plumes that carry dissolved toxic metals. In mines where\nlimestone is a waste rock or where carbonate minerals like calcite or\ndolomite are present, their acid neutralizing potential helps reduce acid rock drainage. Although this is a natural process\ntoo, it is very important to isolate mine dumps and tailings from oxygenated water, both to prevent the sulfides from dis-\nsolving and subsequently percolating the sulfate-rich water into waterways. Industry has taken great strides to prevent\ncontamination in recent decades, but earlier mining projects are still causing problems with local ecosystems. 444 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\n16.3.3 Nonmetallic Mineral Deposits\nWhile receiving much less attention, nonmetallic mineral resources,\nalso known as industrial minerals, are just as vital to ancient and mod-\nern society as metallic minerals. The most basic is building stone.\nLimestone, travertine, granite, slate, and marble are common build-\ning stones and have been quarried for centuries. Even today, building\nstones from slate roof tiles to granite countertops are very popular.\nEspecially pure limestone is ground up, processed, and reformed as\nplaster, cement, and concrete. Some nonmetallic mineral resources\nare not mineral specific; nearly any rock or mineral can be used. This is\ngenerally called aggregate, which is used in concrete, roads, and foun-\ndations. Gravel is one of the more common aggregates.\nEvaporites\nEvaporite deposits\nform in restricted\nbasins where water\nevaporates faster than\nit recharges, such as\nthe Great Salt Lake in\nUtah, or the Dead Sea,\nFigure 16.36: Carrara marble quarry in Italy, source to\nwhich borders Israel\nfamous sculptures like Michelangelo\u2019s David.\nand Jordan. As the\nwaters evaporate, soluble minerals are concentrated and become super-\nFigure 16.37: Salt-covered plain known as the saturated, at which point they precipitate from the now highly-saline\nBonneville Salt Flats, Utah. waters. If these conditions persist for long stretches, thick rock salt, rock\ngypsum, and other mineral deposits accumulate (see chapter 5).\nEvaporite minerals, such as halite, are used in our food as common\ntable salt. Salt was a vitally important food preservative and economic\nresource before refrigeration was developed. While still used in food,\nhalite is now mainly mined as a chemical agent, water softener, or road\nde-icer. Gypsum is a common nonmetallic mineral used as a building\nmaterial; it is the main component in dry wall. It is also used as a fertil-\nizer. Other evaporites include sylvite\u2014potassium chloride, and bischof-\nite\u2014magnesium chloride, both of which are used in agriculture,\nmedicine, food processing, and other applications. Potash, a group of\nhighly soluble potassium-bearing evaporite minerals, is used as a fer-\ntilizer. In hyper-arid locations, even more rare and complex evaporites, Figure 16.38: Hanksite, Na22K(SO4)9(CO3)2Cl, one of the\nfew minerals that is considered a carbonate and a\nlike borax, trona, ulexite, and hanksite are mined. They can be found in\nsulfate.\nplaces such as Searles Dry Lake and Death Valley, California, and in the\nGreen River Formation\u2019s ancient evaporite deposits in Utah and Wyoming. ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES | 445\nPhosphorus\nPhosphorus is an essential element that occurs in the mineral apatite, which is\nfound in trace amounts in common igneous rocks. Phosphorite rock, which is\nformed in sedimentary environments in the ocean, contains abundant apatite and\nis mined to make fertilizer. Without phosphorus, life as we know it is not possible.\nPhosphorous is an important component of bone and DNA. Bone ash and guano\nare natural sources of phosphorus.\nFigure 16.39: Apatite from Mexico.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 16.3 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

As environmental concerns have become more prominent, the value of the geologist has not decreased,\nas they are still vital in locating the deposits and identifying the least intrusive methods of extraction.\nEnergy resources are general grouped as being renewable or nonrenewable. Geologists can aid in locating the best\nplaces to exploit renewable resources (e.g. locating a dam), but are commonly tasked with finding nonrenewable fossil\nfuels. Mineral resources are also grouped in two categories: metallic and nonmetallic. Minerals have a wide variety of\nprocesses that concentrate them to economic levels, and are usually mined via surface or underground methods. 446 | ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 16 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Evidence for the\nbig bang is the cosmic \u201cafterglow\u201d from when the universe was still very dense, and red-shifted light from distant galaxies,\nwhich tell us the universe is still expanding.\nThe big bang produced hydrogen, helium, and lithium, but heavier elements come from nuclear fusion reactions in stars.\nLarge stars make elements such as silicon, iron, and magnesium, which are important in forming terrestrial planets. Large\nstars explode as supernovae and scatter the elements into space.\nPlanetary systems begin with the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. Material drawn to the center forms a star, and the\nremainder forms a disk around the star. Material within the disk clumps together to form planets. In our solar system, rocky\nplanets are closer to the Sun, and ice and gas giants are farther away. This is because temperatures near the Sun were too\nhigh for ice to form, but silicate minerals and metals could solidify.\nEarly Earth was heated by radioactive decay, collisions with bodies from space, and gravitational compression. Heating\nmelted Earth, causing molten metal to sink to Earth\u2019s center and form a core, and silicate melt to float to the surface and\nform the mantle and crust. A collision with a planet the size of Mars knocked debris into orbit around Earth, and the debris\ncoalesced into the moon. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is the result of volcanic degassing, contributions by comets and meteorites,\nand photosynthesis.\nThe search for exoplanets has identified 12 planets that are similar in size to Earth and within the habitable zone of their\nstars. These are thought to be rocky worlds like Earth, but the compositions of these planets are not known for certain. 452 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\n17.1 The Big Bang\nAccording to the big bang theory, the universe blinked\nviolently into existence 13.77 billion years ago. The big bang\nis often described as an explosion, but imagining it as an\nenormous fireball isn\u2019t accurate. The big bang involved a\nsudden expansion of matter, energy, and space from a sin-\ngle point. The kind of Hollywood explosion that might\ncome to mind involves expansion of matter and energy\nwithin space, but during the big bang, space itself was cre-\nated.\nAt the start of the big bang, the universe was too hot and\ndense to be anything but a sizzle of particles smaller than\natoms, but as it expanded, it also cooled. Eventually some\nof the particles collided and stuck together. Those colli-\nFigure 17.1: The big bang. The universe began 13.77 billion years ago\nsions produced hydrogen and helium, the most common with a sudden expansion of space, matter, and energy, and it continues\nto expand today.\nelements in the universe, along with a small amount of\nlithium.\nYou may wonder how a universe can be created out of nothing, or how we can know that the big bang happened at all.\nCreating a universe out of nothing is mostly beyond the scope of this chapter, but there is a way to think about it. The parti-\ncles that make up the universe have opposites that cancel each other out, similar to the way that we can add the numbers\n1 and \u22121 to get zero (also known as \u201cnothing\u201d). As far as the math goes, having zero is exactly the same as having a 1 and a\n\u22121. It is also exactly the same as having a 2 and a \u22122, a 3 and a \u22123, two \u22121s and a 2, and so on. In other words, nothing is really\nthe potential for something if you divide it into its opposite parts. As for how we can know that the big bang happened at all,\nthere are very good reasons to accept that it is indeed how our universe came to be.\n17.1.1 Looking Back to the Early Stages of the Big Bang\nThe notion of seeing the past is often used metaphorically when we talk about ancient events, but in this case it is meant\nliterally. In our everyday experience, when we watch an event take place, we perceive that we are watching it as it unfolds\nin real time. In fact, this isn\u2019t true. To see the event, light from that event must travel to our eyes. Light travels very rapidly,\nbut it does not travel instantly. If we were watching a digital clock 1 m away from us change from 11:59 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., we\nwould actually see it turn to 12:00 p.m. three billionths of a second after it happened. This isn\u2019t enough of a delay to cause\nus to be late for an appointment, but the universe is a very big place, and the \u201cdigital clock\u201d in question is often much,\nmuch farther away. In fact, the universe is so big that it is convenient to describe distances in terms of light years, or the\ndistance light travels in one year. What this means is that light from distant objects takes so long to get to us that we see\nthose objects as they were at some considerable time in the past. For example, the star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light years\nfrom the sun. If you viewed Proxima Centauri from Earth on January 1, 2015, you would actually see it as it appeared in early\nOctober 2010. ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM | 453\nWe now have tools that are powerful enough to look deep\ninto space and see the arrival of light from early in the uni-\nverse\u2019s history. Astronomers can detect light from approxi-\nmately 375,000 years after the big bang is thought to have\noccurred. Physicists tell us that if the big bang happened,\nthen particles within the universe would still be very close\ntogether at this time. They would be so close that light\nwouldn\u2019t be able to travel far without bumping into another\nparticle and getting scattered in another direction.

The ripples made in the direction the car is moving are closer\ntogether than the ripples behind the car.\nThe expansion that started with the big bang never stopped. It continues today, and we can see it happening by observing\ngalaxies that large clusters of billions of stars, called galaxies, are moving away from us. (The exception is the Andromeda\ngalaxy with which we are on a collision course.) The astronomer Edwin Hubble came to this conclusion when he observed\nthat the light from other galaxies was red-shifted. The red shift is a consequence of the Doppler effect. This refers to how\nwe see waves when the object that is creating the waves is moving toward us or away from us. 454 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\nBefore we get to the Doppler effect as it pertains to the red shift,\nlet\u2019s see how it works on something more tangible. The swim-\nming duckling is generating waves as it moves through the\nwater. It is generating waves that move forward as well as back,\nbut notice that the ripples ahead of the duckling are closer to\neach other than the ripples behind the duckling. The distance\nfrom one ripple to the next is called the wavelength. The wave-\nlength is shorter in the direction that the duckling is moving, and\nlonger as the duckling moves away.\nWhen waves are in air as sound waves rather than in water as\nripples, the different wavelengths manifest as sounds with differ-\nent pitches\u2014the short wavelengths have a higher pitch, and the\nlong wavelengths have a lower pitch. This is why the pitch of a\nFigure 17.4: Red shift in light from the supercluster BAS11 car\u2019s engine changes as the car races past you.\ncompared to the sun\u2019s light.

Decades of observation and spacecraft exploration have revealed that most of these objects\nformed together with the Sun about 4.5 billion years ago. They represent clumps of material that condensed from an enor-\nmous cloud of gas and dust. The central part of this cloud became the Sun, and a small fraction of the material in the outer\nparts eventually formed the other objects.\n1.Source: OpenStax Astronomy (CC BY).

In\naddition to gathering information with powerful new telescopes, we have sent spacecraft directly to many members of the\nplanetary system. (Planetary astronomy is the only branch of our science in which we can, at least vicariously, travel to\nthe objects we want to study.) With evocative names such as Voyager, Pioneer, Curiosity, and Pathfinder, our robot explorers\nhave flown past, orbited, or landed on every planet, returning images and data that have dazzled both astronomers and\nthe public. In the process, we have also investigated two dwarf planets, hundreds of fascinating moons, four ring systems,\na dozen asteroids, and several comets (smaller members of our solar system that we will discuss later).\nOur probes have penetrated the atmosphere of Jupiter and landed on the surfaces of Venus, Mars, our Moon, Saturn\u2019s\nmoon Titan, the asteroids Eros, Itokawa, Ryugu, and Bennu, and the Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (usually referred to\nas 67P). Humans have set foot on the Moon and returned samples of its surface soil for laboratory analysis. We have flown\na helicopter drone on Mars. We have even discovered other places in our solar system that might be able to support some\nkind of life.\n17.2.1 An Inventory\nThe Sun, a star that is brighter than about 80% of the stars in the Galaxy, is by\nfar the most massive member of the solar system. It is an enormous ball about\n1.4 million kilometers in diameter, with surface layers of incandescent gas and\nan interior temperature of millions of degrees. The Sun will be discussed in\nlater chapters as our first, and best-studied, example of a star.\nObject Percentage of total mass of solar system\nSun 99.8%\nJupiter 0.1%\nComets 0.0005-0.03% (estimate)\nFigure 17.5: Astronauts on the Moon.

Note that the Sun is by far the most massive member of the solar system.\nMost of the material of the planets in the solar system is actually concentrated in the largest one, Jupiter, which is more\nmassive than all the rest of the planets combined. Astronomers were able to determine the masses of the planets centuries\nago using Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion and Newton\u2019s law of gravity to measure the planets\u2019 gravitational effects on\none another or on moons that orbit them. Today, we make even more precise measurements of their masses by tracking\ntheir gravitational effects on the motion of spacecraft that pass near them. 456 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\nFigure 17.6: Orbits of the planets. All eight major planets orbit the Sun in roughly the same plane. Note that Pluto\u2019s orbit is not in\nthe plane of the planets.\nBeside Earth, five other planets were known to the ancients\u2014Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014and two were\ndiscovered after the invention of the telescope: Uranus and Neptune. The eight planets all revolve in the same direction\naround the Sun. They orbit in approximately the same plane, like cars traveling on concentric tracks on a giant, flat race-\ncourse. Each planet stays in its own \u201ctraffic lane,\u201d following a nearly circular orbit about the Sun and obeying the \u201ctraffic\u201d laws\ndiscovered by Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. Besides these planets, we have also been discovering smaller worlds beyond\nNeptune that are called trans-Neptunian objects or TNOs. The first to be found, in 1930, was Pluto, but others have been\ndiscovered during the twenty-first century. One of them, Eris, is about the same size as Pluto and has at least one moon\n(Pluto has five known moons). The largest TNOs are also classed as dwarf planets, as is the largest asteroid, Ceres. To\ndate, more than 2600 of these TNOs have been discovered, and one, called Arrokoth, was explored by the New Horizons\nspacecraft. ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM | 457\nEach of the planets and dwarf planets also rotates (spins) about an axis run-\nning through it, and in most cases the direction of rotation is the same as the\ndirection of revolution about the Sun. The exceptions are Venus, which rotates\nbackward very slowly (that is, in a retrograde direction), and Uranus and Pluto,\nwhich also have strange rotations, each spinning about an axis tipped nearly on\nits side. We do not yet know the spin orientations of Eris, Haumea, and Make-\nmake.\nThe four planets closest to the Sun (Mercury through Mars) are called the inner\nor terrestrial planets. Often, the Moon is also discussed as a part of this group,\nbringing the total of terrestrial objects to five (we generally call Earth\u2019s satellite\n\u201cthe Moon,\u201d with a capital M, and the other satellites \u201cmoons,\u201d with lowercase\nm\u2019s). The terrestrial planets are relatively small worlds, composed primarily of\nrock and metal. All of them have solid surfaces that bear the records of their\nFigure 17.7: Surface of Mercury.

Distance is not to scale. like vast, spherical oceans with much smaller, dense cores.\nNear the outer edge of the system lies Pluto, which was the first of the distant icy worlds to be discovered beyond Neptune\n(Pluto was visited by a spacecraft, the NASA New Horizons mission, in 2015).\nFigure 17.9: This intriguing image from the New\nHorizons spacecraft, taken when it flew by the\ndwarf planet Pluto in July 2015, shows some of its\ncomplex surface features.

Beyond\nthat is the Oort cloud, a zone filled with small and dispersed ice traces. These two locations are where most comets form\nand continue to orbit, and objects found here have relatively irregular orbits compared to the rest of the solar system. Pluto,\nformerly the ninth planet, is located in this region of space. The XXVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical\nUnion (IAU) stripped Pluto of planetary status in 2006 because scientists discovered an object more massive than Pluto,\nwhich they named Eris. The IAU decided against including Eris as a planet, and therefore, excluded Pluto as well.\nThe IAU narrowed the definition of a planet to three criteria: 1) it must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun),\n2) it must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape, and 3) it must be big enough that its\ngravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun. Pluto passed the first two parts of the\ndefinition, but not the third. Pluto and Eris are currently classified as dwarf planets.\n17.2.2 Smaller Members of the Solar System\nMost of the planets are accompanied by one or more moons; only Mercury and Venus move through space alone. There\nare more than 210 known moons orbiting planets and dwarf planets, and undoubtedly many other small ones remain\nundiscovered. The largest of the moons are as big as small planets and just as interesting. In addition to our Moon, they\ninclude the four largest moons of Jupiter (called the Galilean moons, after their discoverer) and the largest moons of Saturn\nand Neptune (confusingly named Titan and Triton).\nEach of the giant planets also has rings made up of countless small\nbodies ranging in size from mountains to mere grains of dust, all in\norbit about the equator of the planet. The bright rings of Saturn are,\nby far, the easiest to see. They are among the most beautiful sights\nin the solar system. But, all four ring systems are interesting to sci-\nentists because of their complicated forms, influenced by the pull\nof the moons that also orbit these giant planets.\nThe solar system has many other less-conspicuous members.\nAnother group is the asteroids, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun like\nminiature planets, mostly in the space between Mars and Jupiter\n(although some do cross the orbits of planets like Earth). Most\nasteroids are remnants of the initial population of the solar system\nFigure 17.10: Saturn and its A, B, and C rings in visible and\n(inset) infrared light.

ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM | 459\nAnother class of small bodies is composed mostly of ice, made of frozen gases such\nas water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide; these objects are called comets.\nComets also are remnants from the formation of the solar system, but they were\nformed and continue (with rare exceptions) to orbit the Sun in distant, cooler\nregions\u2014stored in a sort of cosmic deep freeze. This is also the realm of the larger icy\nworlds, called dwarf planets.\nFinally, there are countless grains of bro-\nken rock, which we call cosmic dust, scat-\ntered throughout the solar system. When\nthese particles enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n(as millions do each day), they burn up,\nproducing a brief flash of light in the night\nFigure 17.11: Asteroid Eros.

There is surprisingly little color\nvariation across the surface of the comet.\n17.2.3 A Scale Model of the Solar System\nAstronomy often deals with dimensions and distances that far exceed our ordinary experience. What does 1.4 billion kilo-\nmeters\u2014the distance from the Sun to Saturn\u2014really mean to anyone? It can be helpful to visualize such large systems in\nterms of a scale model.\nIn our imaginations, let us build a scale model of the solar system, adopting a scale factor of 1 billion (109)\u2014that is, reducing\nthe actual solar system by dividing every dimension by a factor of 109. Earth, then, has a diameter of 1.3 centimeters, about\nthe size of a grape. The Moon is a pea orbiting this at a distance of 40 centimeters, or a little more than a foot away. The\nEarth-Moon system fits into a standard backpack.\nIn this model, the Sun is nearly 1.5 meters in diameter, about the average height of an adult, and our Earth is at a distance\nof 150 meters\u2014about one city block\u2014from the Sun. Jupiter is five blocks away from the Sun, and its diameter is 15 cen-\ntimeters, about the size of a very large grapefruit. Saturn is 10 blocks from the Sun; Uranus, 20 blocks; and Neptune, 30\nblocks. Pluto, with a distance that varies quite a bit during its 249-year orbit, is currently just beyond 30 blocks and getting\nfarther with time. Most of the moons of the outer solar system are the sizes of various kinds of seeds orbiting the grapefruit,\noranges, and lemons that represent the outer planets.\nIn our scale model, a human is reduced to the dimensions of a single atom, and cars and spacecraft to the size of mole-\ncules. Sending the Voyager spacecraft to Neptune involves navigating a single molecule from the Earth\u2013grape toward a\nlemon 5 kilometers away with an accuracy equivalent to the width of a thread in a spider\u2019s web.\nIf that model represents the solar system, where would the nearest stars be? If we keep the same scale, the closest stars\nwould be tens of thousands of kilometers away. If you built this scale model in the city where you live, you would have to\nplace the representations of these stars on the other side of Earth or beyond. 460 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\nBy the way, model solar systems like the one we just presented have been built in cities throughout the world. In Sweden,\nfor example, Stockholm\u2019s huge Globe Arena has become a model for the Sun, and Pluto is represented by a 12-centime-\nter sculpture in the small town of Delsbo, 300 kilometers away. Another model solar system is in Washington on the Mall\nbetween the White House and Congress (perhaps proving they are worlds apart?).\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 17.2 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Certainly their compositions are dominated by different elements.\nLet us look at each type in more detail.\n17.3.1 The Giant Planets\nThe two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, have nearly the same chemical makeup as the Sun; they are composed pri-\nmarily of the two elements hydrogen and helium, with 75% of their mass being hydrogen and 25% helium. On Earth, both\nhydrogen and helium are gases, so Jupiter and Saturn are sometimes called gas planets. But, this name is misleading.\nJupiter and Saturn are so large that the gas is compressed in their interior until the hydrogen becomes a liquid. Because\nthe bulk of both planets consists of compressed, liquefied hydrogen, we should really call them liquid planets.\n2.Source: OpenStax Astronomy (CC BY). Access for free at https://openstax.org/books/astronomy/pages/\n7-2-composition-and-structure-of-planets ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM | 461\nUnder the force of gravity, the heavier elements sink toward the inner\nparts of a liquid or gaseous planet. Both Jupiter and Saturn, therefore,\nhave cores composed of heavier rock, metal, and ice, but we cannot\nsee these regions directly. In fact, when we look down from above, all\nwe see is the atmosphere with its swirling clouds. We must infer the\nexistence of the denser core inside these planets from studies of each\nplanet\u2019s gravity.\nUranus and Neptune are much smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, but\neach also has a core of rock, metal, and ice. Uranus and Neptune were\nless efficient at attracting hydrogen and helium gas, so they have much\nsmaller atmospheres in proportion to their cores.\nChemically, each giant planet is dominated by hydrogen and its many\ncompounds. Nearly all the oxygen present is combined chemically with\nhydrogen to form water (H2O). Chemists call such a hydrogen-domi-\nnated composition reduced. Throughout the outer solar system, we find Figure 17.13: Jupiter with its moon Europa on the left.\nabundant water (mostly in the form of ice) and reducing chemistry. Earth\u2019s diameter is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, and 4\ntimes larger than Europa.\n17.3.2 The Terrestrial Planets\nThe terrestrial planets are quite different from the giants. In addition to being much smaller, they are composed primarily of\nrocks and metals. These, in turn, are made of elements that are less common in the universe as a whole. The most abun-\ndant rocks, called silicates, are made of silicon and oxygen, and the most common metal is iron. We can tell from their\ndensities that Mercury has the greatest proportion of metals (which are denser) and the Moon has the lowest. Earth, Venus,\nand Mars all have roughly similar bulk compositions: about one third of their mass consists of iron-nickel or iron-sulfur com-\nbinations; two thirds is made of silicates. Because these planets are largely composed of oxygen compounds (such as the\nsilicate minerals of their crusts), their chemistry is said to be oxidized.\nWhen we look at the internal structure of each of the terrestrial planets, we find that the densest metals are in a central\ncore, with the lighter silicates near the surface. If these planets were liquid, like the giant planets, we could understand this\neffect as the result the sinking of heavier elements due to the pull of gravity. This leads us to conclude that, although the\nterrestrial planets are solid today, at one time they must have been hot enough to melt.\nDifferentiation is the process by which gravity helps separate a planet\u2019s interior into layers of different compositions and\ndensities. The heavier metals sink to form a core, while the lightest minerals float to the surface to form a crust. Later, when\nthe planet cools, this layered structure is preserved. In order for a rocky planet to differentiate, it must be heated to the\nmelting point of rocks, which is typically more than 1300 K.\n17.3.3 Moons, Asteroids, and Comets\nChemically and structurally, Earth\u2019s Moon is like the terrestrial planets, but most moons are in the outer solar system,\nand they have compositions similar to the cores of the giant planets around which they orbit. The three largest\nmoons\u2014Ganymede and Callisto in the Jovian system, and Titan in the Saturnian system\u2014are composed half of frozen\nwater, and half of rocks and metals. Most of these moons differentiated during formation, and today they have cores of\nrock and metal, with upper layers and crusts of very cold and\u2014thus very hard\u2014ice. 462 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\nMost of the asteroids and comets, as well as the smallest moons, were\nprobably never heated to the melting point. However, some of the\nlargest asteroids, such as Vesta, appear to be differentiated; others are\nfragments from differentiated bodies. Many of the smaller objects seem\nto be fragments or rubble piles that are the result of collisions. Because\nmost asteroids and comets retain their original composition, they repre-\nsent relatively unmodified material dating back to the time of the for-\nmation of the solar system. In a sense, they act as chemical fossils,\nhelping us to learn about a time long ago whose traces have been\nerased on larger worlds.\n17.3.4 Temperatures: Going to Extremes\nGenerally speaking, the farther a planet or moon is from the Sun, the\ncooler its surface. The planets are heated by the radiant energy of the\nSun, which gets weaker with the square of the distance. You know how\nFigure 17.14: Jupiter\u2019s moon Ganymede. The brownish\nrapidly the heating effect of a fireplace or an outdoor radiant heater gray color of the surface indicates a dusty mixture of\ndiminishes as you walk away from it; the same effect applies to the rocky material and ice. The bright spots are places where\nrecent impacts have uncovered fresh ice from\nSun. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has a blistering surface\nunderneath.\ntemperature that ranges from 280\u2013430 \u00b0C on its sunlit side, whereas the\nsurface temperature on Pluto is only about \u2013220 \u00b0C, colder than liquid air.\nMathematically, the temperatures decrease approximately in proportion to the square root of the distance from the Sun.\nPluto is about 30 AU at its closest to the Sun (or 100 times the distance of Mercury) and about 49 AU at its farthest from the\nSun. Thus, Pluto\u2019s temperature is less than that of Mercury by the square root of 100, or a factor of 10: from 500 K to 50 K.\nIn addition to its distance from the Sun, the surface temperature of a planet can be influenced strongly by its atmosphere.\nWithout our atmospheric insulation (the greenhouse effect, which keeps the heat in), the oceans of Earth would be per-\nmanently frozen. Conversely, if Mars once had a larger atmosphere in the past, it could have supported a more temperate\nclimate than it has today. Venus is an even more extreme example, where its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide acts as\ninsulation, reducing the escape of heat built up at the surface, resulting in temperatures greater than those on Mercury.\nToday, Earth is the only planet where surface temperatures generally lie between the freezing and boiling points of water.\nAs far as we know, Earth is the only planet to support life.\n17.3.5 Dating Planetary Surfaces3\nHow do we know the age of the surfaces we see on planets and moons? If a world has a surface (as opposed to being\nmostly gas and liquid), astronomers have developed some techniques for estimating how long ago that surface solidified.\nNote that the age of these surfaces is not necessarily the age of the planet as a whole. On geologically active objects\n(including Earth), vast outpourings of molten rock or the erosive effects of water and ice, which we call planet weathering,\nhave erased evidence of earlier epochs and present us with only a relatively young surface for investigation.\nOne way to estimate the age of a surface is by counting the number of impact craters. This technique works because the\nrate at which impacts have occurred in the solar system has been roughly constant for several billion years. Thus, in the\nabsence of forces to eliminate craters, the number of craters is simply proportional to the length of time the surface has\nbeen exposed. This technique has been applied successfully to many solid planets and moons.\n3. Source: OpenStax Astronomy (CC BY). Access for free at https://openstax.org/books/astronomy/pages/\n7-3-dating-planetary-surfaces ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM | 463\nBear in mind that crater counts can tell us only the time since the surface\nexperienced a major change that could modify or erase preexisting\ncraters. Estimating ages from crater counts is a little like walking along a\nsidewalk in a snowstorm after the snow has been falling steadily for a day\nor more. You may notice that in front of one house the snow is deep, while\nnext door the sidewalk may be almost clear. Do you conclude that less\nsnow has fallen in front of Ms. Jones\u2019 house than Mr. Smith\u2019s? More likely,\nyou conclude that Jones has recently swept the walk clean and Smith has\nnot. Similarly, the numbers of craters indicate how long it has been since a\nplanetary surface was last \u201cswept clean\u201d by ongoing lava flows or by\nmolten materials ejected when a large impact happened nearby.\nStill, astronomers can use the numbers of craters on different parts of the\nsame world to provide important clues about how regions on that world\nevolved. On a given planet or moon, the more heavily cratered terrain will\ngenerally be older (that is, more time will have elapsed there since some- Figure 17.15: Our cratered Moon. This composite image\nthing swept the region clean). of the Moon\u2019s surface was made from many smaller\nimages taken between November 2009 and February\n2011 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and\n17.3.6 Radioactive Rocks shows craters of many different sizes.\nAnother way to trace the history of a solid world is to measure the age of individual rocks. After samples were brought back\nfrom the Moon by Apollo astronauts, the techniques that had been developed to date rocks on Earth were applied to rock\nsamples from the Moon to establish a geological chronology for the Moon. Furthermore, a few samples of material from\nthe Moon, Mars, and the large asteroid Vesta have fallen to Earth as meteorites and can be examined directly.\nScientists measure the age of rocks using the properties of natural radioactivity. Around the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury, physicists began to understand that some atomic nuclei are not stable but can split apart (decay) spontaneously\ninto smaller nuclei. The process of radioactive decay involves the emission of particles such as electrons, or of radiation in\nthe form of gamma rays.\nFor any one radioactive nucleus, it is not possible to predict when the decay process will happen. Such decay is random in\nnature, like the throw of dice: as gamblers have found all too often, it is impossible to say just when the dice will come up 7\nor 11. But, for a very large number of dice tosses, we can calculate the odds that 7 or 11 will come up. Similarly, if we have a\nvery large number of radioactive atoms of one type (say, uranium), there is a specific time period, called its half-life, during\nwhich the chances are fifty-fifty that decay will occur for any of the nuclei.\nA particular nucleus may last a shorter or longer time than its half-life, but in a large sample, almost exactly half of the\nnuclei will have decayed after a time equal to one half-life. Half of the remaining nuclei will have decayed after two half-\nlives pass, leaving only one half of a half\u2014or one quarter\u2014of the original sample. 464 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\nIf you had 1 gram of pure radioactive nuclei with a half-life\nof 100 years, then after 100 years you would have 1/2 gram;\nafter 200 years, 1/4 gram; after 300 years, only 1/8 gram;\nand so forth. However, the material does not disappear.\nInstead, the radioactive atoms are replaced with their\ndecay products. Sometimes the radioactive atoms are\ncalled parents and the decay products are called daugh-\nter elements.\nIn this way, radioactive elements with half-lives we have\ndetermined can provide accurate nuclear clocks. By com-\nparing how much of a radioactive parent element is left in\na rock to how much of its daughter products have accu-\nFigure 17.16: Radioactive decay.

The number after each element is its atomic weight, equal to the\nnumber of protons plus neutrons in its nucleus.

Until then, astronomers and geologists had no reliable way to measure the age of the lunar surface. Counting\ncraters had let us calculate relative ages (for example, the heavily cratered lunar highlands were older than the dark lava\nplains), but scientists could not measure the actual age in years. Some thought that the ages were as young as those of\nEarth\u2019s surface, which has been resurfaced by many geological events. For the Moon\u2019s surface to be so young would imply\nactive geology on our satellite. Only in 1969, when the first Apollo samples were dated, did we learn that the Moon is an\nancient, geologically dead world. Using such dating techniques, we have been able to determine the ages of both Earth\nand the Moon: each was formed about 4.5 billion years ago (although, as we shall see, Earth probably formed earlier than\nthe Moon).\nWe should also note that the decay of radioactive nuclei generally releases energy in the form of heat. Although the energy\nfrom a single nucleus is not very large (in human terms), the enormous numbers of radioactive nuclei in a planet or moon\n(especially early in its existence) can be a significant source of internal energy for that world. Geologists estimate that about\nhalf of Earth\u2019s current internal heat budget comes from the decay of radioactive isotopes in its interior.

Each planet and moon is a fascinating place\nthat may stimulate our imagination as we try to picture what it would be like to visit. Taken together, the members of the\nsolar system preserve patterns that can tell us about the formation of the entire system. As we begin our exploration of the\nplanets, we want to introduce our modern picture of how the solar system formed.\nThe recent discovery of thousands of planets in orbit around other stars has shown astronomers that many exoplanetary\nsystems can be quite different from our own solar system. For example, it is common for these systems to include planets\nintermediate in size between our terrestrial and giant planets. These are often called superearths. Some exoplanet systems\neven have giant planets close to the star, reversing the order we see in our system.\n17.4.1 Looking for Patterns\nOne way to approach our question of origin is to look for regularities among the planets. We found, for example, that all\nthe planets lie in nearly the same plane and revolve in the same direction around the Sun. The Sun also spins in the same\ndirection about its own axis. Astronomers interpret this pattern as evidence that the Sun and planets formed together from\na spinning cloud of gas and dust that we call the solar nebula.\n4.Source: OpenStax Astronomy (CC BY). Access for free at https://openstax.org/books/astronomy/pages/\n7-4-origin-of-the-solar-system 466 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\nThe composition of the planets gives another clue about\norigins. Spectroscopic analysis allows us to determine\nwhich elements are present in the Sun and the planets.\nThe Sun has the same hydrogen-dominated composition\nas Jupiter and Saturn, and therefore appears to have been\nformed from the same reservoir of material. In comparison,\nthe terrestrial planets and our Moon are relatively deficient\nin the light gases and the various ices that form from the\ncommon elements oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. Instead,\non Earth and its neighbors, we see mostly the rarer heavy\nelements such as iron and silicon. This pattern suggests\nthat the processes that led to planet formation in the inner\nsolar system must somehow have excluded much of the\nlighter materials that are common elsewhere. These lighter\nFigure 17.17: NASA artist\u2019s conception of various planet formation\nmaterials must have escaped, leaving a residue of heavy processes, including exocomets and other planetesimals, around Beta\nPictoris, a very young type A V star.\nstuff.\nThe reason for this is not hard to guess, bearing in mind the heat of the Sun. The inner planets and most of the asteroids\nare made of rock and metal, which can survive heat, but they contain very little ice or gas, which evaporate when tem-\nperatures are high (to see what we mean, just compare how long a rock and an ice cube survive when they are placed in\nthe sunlight). In the outer solar system, where it has always been cooler, the planets and their moons, as well as icy dwarf\nplanets and comets, are composed mostly of ice and gas.\n17.4.2 The Evidence from Far Away\nA second approach to understanding the origins of the solar system is to look outward for evidence that other systems of\nplanets are forming elsewhere. We cannot look back in time to the formation of our own system, but many stars in space\nare much younger than the Sun. In these systems, the processes of planet formation might still be accessible to direct\nobservation. We observe that there are many other \u201csolar nebulas\u201d or circumstellar disks\u2014flattened, spinning clouds of gas\nand dust surrounding young stars. These disks resemble our own solar system\u2019s initial stages of formation billions of years\nago. ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM | 467\n17.4.3 Building Planets\nCircumstellar disks are a common occurrence around very\nyoung stars, suggesting that disks and stars form together.\nAstronomers can use theoretical calculations to see how\nsolid bodies might form from the gas and dust in these\ndisks as they cool. These models show that material begins\nto coalesce first by forming smaller objects, precursors of\nthe planets, which we call planetesimals.\nToday\u2019s fast computers can simulate the way millions of\nplanetesimals, probably no larger than 100 kilometers in\ndiameter, might gather together under their mutual gravity\nto form the planets we see today. We are beginning to\nunderstand that this process was a violent one, with plan-\netesimals crashing into each other and sometimes even Figure 17.18: Atlas of Planetary Nurseries. These Hubble Space\nTelescope photos show sections of the Orion Nebula, a relatively\ndisrupting the growing planets themselves. As a conse-\nclose-by region where stars are currently forming.

Each is a contemporary analog of our\nwhich helps explain their present internal structures. own solar nebula\u2014a location where planets are probably being formed\ntoday.\nThe process of impacts and collisions in the early solar sys-\ntem was complex and, apparently, often random. The solar nebula model can explain many of the regularities we find in\nthe solar system, but the random collisions of massive collections of planetesimals could be the reason for some excep-\ntions to the \u201crules\u201d of solar system behavior. For example, why do the planets Uranus and Pluto spin on their sides? Why\ndoes Venus spin slowly and in the opposite direction from the other planets? Why does the composition of the Moon\nresemble Earth in many ways and yet exhibit substantial differences? The answers to such questions probably lie in enor-\nmous collisions that took place in the solar system long before life on Earth began.\nToday, some 4.5 billion years after its origin, the solar system is\u2014thank goodness\u2014a much less violent place. However,\nsome planetesimals have continued to interact and collide, and their fragments move about the solar system as roving\n\u201ctransients\u201d that can make trouble for the established members of the Sun\u2019s family, such as our own Earth.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this section.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for section 17.4 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:\nhttps://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/introearthscience/?p=1809#h5p-114 468 | ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\nSummary\nOur solar system currently consists of the Sun, eight planets, five dwarf planets, nearly 200 known moons, and a host\nof smaller objects. The planets can be divided into two groups: the inner terrestrial planets and the outer giant planets.\nSmaller members of the solar system include asteroids (including the dwarf planet Ceres), which are rocky and metallic\nobjects found mostly between Mars and Jupiter; comets, which are made mostly of frozen gases and generally orbit far\nfrom the Sun; and countless smaller grains of cosmic dust. When a meteor survives its passage through our atmosphere\nand falls to Earth, we call it a meteorite.\nThe ages of the surfaces of objects in the solar system can be estimated by counting craters: on a given world, a more\nheavily cratered region will generally be older than one that is less cratered. We can also use samples of rocks with\nradioactive elements in them to obtain the time since the layer in which the rock formed last solidified. The half-life of a\nradioactive element is the time it takes for half the sample to decay; we determine how many half-lives have passed by\nhow much of a sample remains the radioactive element and how much has become the decay product. In this way, we\nhave estimated the age of the Moon and Earth to be roughly 4.5 billion years.\nRegularities among the planets have led astronomers to hypothesize that the Sun and the planets formed together in a\ngiant, spinning cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Astronomical observations show tantalizingly similar cir-\ncumstellar disks around other stars. Within the solar nebula, material first coalesced into planetesimals; many of these\ngathered together to make the planets and moons. The remainder can still be seen as comets and asteroids. Probably all\nplanetary systems have formed in similar ways, but many exoplanet systems have evolved along quite different paths.\nTake this quiz to check your comprehension of this chapter.\nIf you are using an offline version of this text, access the quiz for chapter 17 via the QR code.\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.
