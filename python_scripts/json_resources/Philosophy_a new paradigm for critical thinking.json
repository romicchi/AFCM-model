The field of critical thinking, as manifested in the\nInformal Logic movement, developed primarily as a response\ntotheinadequaciesofformalismtorepresentactualargumen-\ntative practice and to provide useful argumentative skills to\nstudents. Because of this, the primary focus of the field has\nbeenoninformalargumentsratherthanformalreasoning.Yet\nthe formalist history of the field is still evident in its empha-\nsis,withrespecttoboththeoryandpedagogy,onthestructure\nand evaluation of individual, de-contextualized arguments. It\nis our view that such a view of critical thinking is excessively\nnarrow and limited, failing to provide an understanding of\nargumentation as largely a matter of comparative evaluation\nof a variety of contending positions and arguments with the\ngoal of reaching a reasoned judgment on an issue. As a con-\nsequence, traditional critical thinking instruction is problem-\naticinfailingtoprovidethereasoningskillsthatstudentsneed\nin order to accomplish this goal. Instead, the goal of critical\nthinking instruction has been seen largely as a defensive one:\noflearningtonotfallpreytoinvalid,inadequate, orfallacious\narguments.\nxiiMARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN While acknowledging the value of \u201clogical self-defense,\u201d we\nseethecriticalthinkingprojectashavingamuchmoreexpan-\nsive educational goal \u2013 that of critical inquiry. Students need\nto be equipped to critically investigate issues of significance,\nactively seek and identify credible information, and make\njudgments based on a critical evaluation of reasons and evi-\ndence. Thus the alternative conception of critical thinking\nwhich we have been developing, while including fallacy iden-\ntificationandargumentcritique,focusesprimarilyoninquiry,\nwhich we view in terms of arriving at reasoned judgments on\nissues, frequently of a complex nature.\nWe believe that this approach offers a new paradigm for\ncritical thinking because it differs from more traditional con-\nceptionsinanumberoffundamentalways.First,itisprimarily\nepistemological rather than logical. The traditional approach\nfocusesontheevaluationofargumentsaccordingtothenorms\nof logic, informal as well as formal, examining, for example,\nwhether the conclusion of an argument follows from its\npremises or whether logical fallacies have been committed.\nTheinquiryapproach,ontheotherhand,appealstotherange\nof epistemological norms used to justify and critique claims\nin a variety of areas, including, for example, criteria for eval-\nuating sources, judging causal claims, or evaluating statistical\narguments.\nSecond, the inquiry approach differs from the traditional\napproachinbeingdialectical.Itdoesnotfocussimplyonindi-\nvidual arguments but rather on the comparative evaluation of\navarietyofcontendingpositionsandargumentsnecessaryfor\ncoming to a reasoned judgment.\nFinally the inquiry approach is contextual. The consider-\nation of context has traditionally been viewed as irrelevant\nto the evaluation of an argument. In contrast, the inquiry\napproach, focusing as it does on issues rather than individual\narguments,takesasanimportantaspectofevaluationthecon-\nsideration of the context in which the issue has been devel-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING xiii oped, including its dialectical, intellectual, and historical con-\ntexts.\nWe have implemented this inquiry approach in our text-\nbook, Reason in the Balance: An Inquiry Approach to Critical\nThinking(Hackett2016;McGraw-HillRyerson2010).Thetext\nuses dialogues among an ongoing cast of characters involved\nin realistic situations as a context for discussing the various\naspectsthatgointothepracticeofinquiry,includingidentify-\ningissues,identifyingtherelevantcontexts,understandingthe\ncompeting cases, and making a comparative judgment among\nthem.Theseaspectsareinstantiatedininquiriesontopicssuch\nas vegetarianism, vaccination, prostitution, conspiracy theo-\nries,theevaluationofafilm,thelegalizationofmarijuana,and\nthe right of hate groups to speak. These various aspects are\nalso applied to inquiry in specific contexts, including science,\nsocialscience,philosophy,andthearts.Thereisalsoconsider-\nable emphasis placed throughout on the habits of mind which\nareessentialforinquiry,including(amongothers)open-mind-\nedness, fair-mindedness, the desire to act on the basis of rea-\nsons, the acceptance of uncertainty, and respect for others in\ndialogue \u2013 habits of mind which we characterize as the spirit\nof inquiry.\nThe present volume can be seen as a theoretical companion\npiecetothetextbook.Whatwehavedonehereistocollectthe\nvarious papers that reflect the development of our approach,\nhighlighting its foundation, theoretical elaboration, and\ndiverse applications. These papers were written over a period\nof time and reflect the development of this approach histor-\nically as well as conceptually. The papers have all been pub-\nlishedpreviouslyandarepresented,forthemostpart,intheir\noriginal form. As such, they draw on the research and litera-\nture available at the time of their creation or publication and\nreflect the dialectical context in which the ideas were initially\ndeveloped. Our ideas have, to be sure, developed over time in\nresponse to a changing dialectical context. We have revisited\nxivMARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN issues,developingtheminwhatwehopeisamorerobustand\nnuanced way, and explored implications and applications of\ntheapproach.Whilewehaveaddedsomemorecontemporary\nreferencestoseveraloftheearliestpapers(chapter1,2,3,and\n11), we have endeavoured to remain faithful to the original\npurpose and context of each paper and to the developmental\nnature of the project as a whole.\nTHE PAPERS\nThe issues reflected here are ones which we have been\nthinking about and writing about for many years. We were\neach, independently, over the years, coming to the view that\nthere were problems in basing critical thinking instruction\nstrictly on the evaluation of individual arguments and in the\nfallacy approach; and we were both developing alternative\nways to conceptualize critical thinking.\nMark\u2019s 1989 paper, \u201cCritical Thinking as Applied Episte-\nmology: Relocating Critical Thinking in the Philosophical\nLandscape,\u201d is an early elaboration of such an alternative con-\nception. The paper argues that the appropriate philosophical\nheritageofcriticalthinkingisnotinlogic,asisimpliedbythe\nterm \u2018Informal logic,\u2019 but rather in epistemology, involving as\nit does the application of epistemological norms to common\nproblems.Italsoarguesthat,justasappliedethicscontributes\ntotheenhancementofnormativeethics,soalsoshouldapplied\nepistemology contribute to the enhancement of traditional\nepistemic norms.\nSharon\u2019s 1992 \u201cArgumentation as Inquiry\u201d also addresses\nthe issue of how argumentation should be conceived. The\npapercontestsBlair\u2019scontentionthatallargumentationcanbe\nconstrued as instances of two person dispute-resolving argu-\nmentation and argues that, from both an epistemological and\na pedagogical perspective, argumentation is best conceived as\ninquiry.\nSharon\u2019s 1999 paper, \u201cThe Problem with Percy: Epistemol-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING xv ogy, Understanding, and Critical Thinking,\u201d further develops\nthe argument for the centrality of epistemology for critical\nthinking. The paper argues that the requisites for critical\nthinking cannot be fully encompassed by the notions of skills\nand dispositions and that the additional dimension is an epis-\ntemological one: an understanding of the nature of inquiry.\nThe ideas regarding the centrality of epistemology and of\ninquiry for critical thinking initially proposed in these three\nearlypapershavebeenfoundationalfortheconceptionofcrit-\nical thinking which we subsequently jointly developed and\nelaborated.\n\u201cReason Appreciation,\u201d an early joint paper, explicates the\nnotion of reason appreciation, which involves a respect for\nreasoning based on an understanding of its nature, role and\nsignificance. Appreciating reason involves, centrally, valuing\nitsprocessesandoutcomes,honouringitsnormativedemands,\nand thus being committed to acting according to its dictates.\nThisnotionisattheheartofoursubsequentideaofthecritical\nspirit, which we argue is central to the process of inquiry.\nIt is in our paper, \u201cInquiry: A Dialectical Approach to Crit-\nical Thinking,\u201d where we lay out our basic approach and its\nrationale. In this paper, we argue that the central goal of crit-\nical thinking is the making of reasoned judgments and that\narriving at reasoned judgments is, in most cases, a dialectical\nprocess involving the comparative weighing of a variety of\ncontending positions and arguments. Recognizing this dialec-\ntical dimension means that critical thinking pedagogy should\nfocus on the kind of comparative evaluation and weighing of\nreasonswhichwemakeinactualcontextsofdisagreementand\ndebate.\nScholarly interest in the kind of dialectical or pro and con\nreasoning which is at the heart of the inquiry approach has\ngrown considerably in recent years with the renewed interest\nin conductive reasoning. As a contribution to this discussion,\nour paper, \u201cGuidelines for Reaching a Reasoned Judgment,\u201d\nxviMARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN addressesthecontentiousissueoftheevaluationofconductive\narguments by offering some general guidelines for reaching a\nwell-reasoned judgment through conductive reasoning and a\nsetofcriteriawhicharisefromtheseguidelinesforidentifying\ninadequate conductive argumentation.\nOneoftheguidelines proposedin\u201cGuidelines forReaching\naReasonedJudgment\u201disthatarguersshouldmakeajudgment\nattheappropriatelevelofconfidence,apportioningtheirjudg-\nment to the strength of the reasons. Our paper, \u201cConductive\nArgumentation, Degrees of Confidence, and the Communi-\ncation of Uncertainty,\u201d takes this line of reasoning further by\narguing that arguers also have an obligation to communicate\ntheir judgments with the appropriate level of confidence,\nexpressingthedegreeofcertaintyoruncertaintywarrantedby\nthe strength of the evidence and arguments.\nA number of the papers develop various aspects of our\napproach and examine its implications for a variety of issues\nin critical thinking and argumentation theory. An early paper\nofMark\u2019s,\u201cAssessingExpertClaims:CriticalThinkingandthe\nAppeal to Authority,\u201d argues that the evaluation of authorita-\ntive information has been given insufficient attention in criti-\ncal thinking instruction. The paper goes on to offer a revised\nset of criteria for assessing appeals to authority which recog-\nnize the role of expert consensus and of the explanation and\njustificationofclaimsofferedbyexperts.Thesecriteria,aimed\natfosteringanappropriatebalancebetweenrationaltrustand\nappropriate skepticism, play an important role in the critical\nevaluation which is integral to the inquiry approach.\nThe role, in inquiry, of identifying fallacies is another sub-\nject of investigation. In \u201cFallacy Identification in a Dialectical\nApproach to Teaching Critical Thinking,\u201d we put forward a\nconception of a fallacy that departs from many standard\naccounts, characterizing a fallacy as an argument pattern\nwhose persuasive power greatly exceeds its probative value.\nWegoontoargue,however,thattheidentificationoffallacies\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING xvii in individual arguments usually cannot, in itself, constitute an\nadequate evaluation of the strength of the argumentative sup-\nport for a claim and that such an assessment must be based\nonthecompletionoftheinquiryandacomparativeevaluation\nofthearguments.Thus,giventhedialecticalnatureofinquiry,\nfallacy identification can play only a preliminary, prima facie\nrole in argument assessment.\nThe significance of considering the context surrounding an\nissue is underestimated and often overlooked in approaches\nto critical thinking theory and instruction based on informal\nlogic. Our paper, \u201cCritical Inquiry: Considering the Context,\u201d\nargues, in contrast, that considering the context of an issue\nis an important component of the inquiry process. The paper\nelaborates on our view about the importance of considering\ncontext by examining in detail the role of a number of differ-\nent aspects of context for inquiry: dialectical context, the cur-\nrent state of belief or practice, intellectual, political, historical\nand social contexts, disciplinary context, sources, and self.\nTheimplicationsforcriticalthinkingtheoryandinstruction\nof the research on cognitive biases is the subject of \u201cCritical\nThinking and Cognitive Biases.\u201d The paper details what this\npsychological work can add to the philosophical understand-\ning of reasoning errors and also highlights how some aspects\nof the inquiry approach can help to counter some of these\nbiases. These include: 1) the identification of the persuasive\npoweroffallacies;2)theuseofstrategiessuchasasetofguid-\ning questions and the conscious monitoring of our thinking\nprocesses to slow down our thinking and make it more delib-\nerate; 3) the deliberate seeking out of counter-evidence and\nalternative views to counter myside bias; and 4) the require-\nmenttoexaminethefullrangeofargumentsonallsidesofan\nissueinordertomakeajudgmentwiththeappropriatedegree\nof confidence, which can act as a counter to the bias of over-\nconfidence.\nOur paper, \u201cDAMed If You Do; DAMed If You Don\u2019t:\nxviiiMARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Cohen\u2019s \u2018Missed Opportunities\u2019,\u201d is written in response to a\npaper by Cohen in which he highlights an apparent tension\nbetweenacollegialpracticeofargumentationinwhicharguers\nhelpeachotherandtheDominantAdversarialModelinwhich\nthe specification of roles precludes such mutual assistance.\nOurpaper,developingathemeinitiallyraisedin\u201cArgumenta-\ntionasInquiry,\u201darguesthatthetensionisresolvedbyrejecting\nthecharacterizationofrolesinherentintheDAMaccountand\nrecognizing that the epistemological structure of argumenta-\ntion necessitates inquiry, which is a collegial, non-adversarial\nenterprise.\nSeveral of our papers examine the application of our\napproach in various contexts. \u201cBeyond the Boundaries: The\nEpistemological Significance of Differing Cultural Perspec-\ntives\u201dfocusesonanaspectofcriticalthinkingwhichiscentral\ntoourdialecticalconception,theconsiderationofalternatives,\naddressing the question of whether and to what extent the\nrequirementtoconsideralternativesextendstothebeliefsand\npractices of other cultures.

INTRODUCTION\nOne of the most important developments in contemporary\nphilosophy has been the interest in applying philosophy to\ncontemporary issues. This occurred first on an ad hoc basis\nas philosophical reasoning was brought to bear on various\nmoral problems such as abortion and triage. But more sig-\nnificantly, it has involved the creation of applied disciplines\nsuchasappliedethics(andsub-disciplinessuchasprofessional\nethics) and Critical Thinking or informal logic.2 While most\n1. I wish to thank the following helpful readers and commentators: Diana\nDavidson, Harvey Siegel, Earl Winkler, Hans Hansen, and Reid Gilbert.\n2.\u201cCritical thinking\u201d is a more generally used term for the subject I wish to discuss, but \u201cinfor-\nmal logic\u201d is the term more widely used in philosophical circles\u2014indeed, as the name of this\njournal. While the terms are often used interchangeably, I think it should be noted that for\nmost educators, informal logic (the analysis and evaluation of arguments in ordinary dis-\ncourse) is a subset of critical thinking. Critical thinking is often taken to involve not only\nargument analysis and evaluation, but also creative thinking and problem solving skills and\na positive attitude towards open-mindedness and the application of informal logic and\nproblem solving skills in everyday life. In its most full-blown articulation, critical thinking\ncan be viewed as an educational ideal very similar to the traditional liberal arts ideal of the\nthoughtful citizen. In this paper, I am concerned to focus on that aspect of Critical Thinking\nthat is of central interest to philosophers\u2014i.e. informal logic, not only because it is of inter-\nest to philosophers, but because it is the central concept on which the notion of Critical\n2MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN philosopherswouldprobablynotquestion myclaimconcern-\ning the importance of developments in applied ethics, they\nmight well question the claim as it applies to informal logic.\nBut I think that this would be a mistake. In this paper I will\nargue that critical thinking\u2019s relationship to philosophy could\nwell be as productive of philosophical insight as is applied\nethics, and, as a result, critical thinking deserves the same\nphilosophical attention as that accorded applied ethics.\n\u201cInformal logic\u201d is the name commonly used in philosophi-\ncal circles to describe critical thinking, but it tends to obscure\nthe relationship of critical thinking to philosophy; critical\nthinking is not a \u201ccasual\u201d relative of logic, as the name sug-\ngests, but, rather, it is a significant effort to apply many of\nthe insights of philosophy and particularly of epistemology to\ncommonquestionsaboutwhatweshouldbelieve.Whatmakes\ncriticalthinking\u201ccritical\u201distheoftennegativeimpactonbelief\nthat results from the application of epistemological norms to\ncommon problems and judgments. Because it is epistemolog-\nical norms and not rules of logic that constitute the philo-\nsophical core of critical thinking, it is unfortunate that this\nactivity has been called and, therefore, misunderstood as in-\nformal logic. A better nomenclature would be \u201capplied episte-\nmology,\u201d suggesting as it does the right philosophical heritage\nand the parallel with applied ethics. Indeed, it is reasonable\nto expect that critical thinking will generate as many interest-\ning problems for epistemology as applied ethics has done for\nethics.\nThere is no novelty in the claim that the theoretical core\nof critical thinking should be thought of as epistemology; an\nexcellent paper by Harvey Siegel (1985) makes this case quite\nThinking depends. Because I am recommending a change of terminology, the terminologi-\ncal problem becomes complex. For this reason, I will use \u201cCritical Thinking\u201d (capital 'C',\ncapital 'T') to refer to Critical Thinking in its broadest ambit and \u201ccritical thinking'\u201d without\ncapitals as synonymous with \u201cinformal logic.\u201d In the long run I would recommend replacing\n\u201cinformal logic\u201d with \u201capplied epistemology,\u201d and keep \u201ccritical thinking\u201d (with or without\ncapitals) to include the broader range of concerns.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 3 eloquently, and McPeck (1981) has made a similar point. The\nargument is very simple. Most of the claims that critical\nthinkers wish to examine are not deductively supported by\ntheir evidence, but are supported by evidence that \u201cwarrants\u201d\norjustifiesthebelief.Thecrucialchallengeforcriticalthinkers\nistoarticulatethenormswhichcanbeusedtojustifywellsup-\nported beliefs and criticize those that are not. While I elabo-\nrate this argument slightly, I am primarily concerned to bring\nto the attention of philosophers the value that the study of\ncritical thinking has for epistemology. I do this by pressing\nthe analogy of applied ethics, and illustrating the significant\nepistemological difficulties that critical thinking has already\nrevealed,as,forexample,theproblemssurroundingtheappeal\nto authority.\nCritical thinking\u2019s failure to attract appropriate attention\nfrom the discipline of philosophy is due I think partly to its\nhistory and partly to its novelty. Let me deal first with its his-\ntory.\nCritical thinking began primarily as a \u201cteaching discipline.\u201d\nHoward Kahane, who can be given large credit for initiating\nthis effort, has explained how he was pushed by student\ndemands for relevance that characterized the sixties to create\nan informal logic course. To many in philosophy, informal\nlogicremains something eithertobecelebrated orenduredin\nthecurriculum,asaholdoverfromthesixtiesandasaboostto\nstudent enrollment in the eighties. Because of the history and\nrole that introductory critical thinking courses play, philoso-\nphers view the course as a service course, as essentially reme-\ndial, yet rarely as a subject with interesting problems worthy\nof study and research.\nI think this is the wrong attitude. Applied ethics had the\nsame \u201csixties\u201d origins, but has now grown into a discipline\nwith numerous journals and sub-disciplines. It has done so\nbecause those who began seriously to \u201capply\u201d such ethical\nunderstanding as they thought philosophy possessed discov-\n4MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ered that their theoretical understanding was not up to the\ncomplexityofmanyreallifesituations.Asaresult,therewasa\nneed for theoretical development which gave central place to\nthe processes and problems of application, the study of which\ngradually took on a life of its own.\nImportant effects of this awareness have been the renewed\nemphasisonrightsinethicalandpoliticalliterature,increased\nskepticism about the value of utilitarianism to solve ethical\nproblemsdespiteitsself-proclaimedpracticality,andageneral\nawareness that much of the difficulty in applying ethical\nnorms comes in interpretation of the norms during appli-\ncation. More generally, the actual effort to resolve pressing\nmoraldilemmas,oratleasttoprovideguidanceforapproach-\ning moral problems, has led to a deeper understanding of\nmoralreasoningandarevitalizationofethicaltheoryasexem-\nplified in such journals asPhilosophy and Public Affairs.\nMuchthesamemaybeexpectedfromcriticalthinking.Not\nonly do striking parallels exist between the relationship that\ncriticalthinkingbearstoepistemologyandthatwhichapplied\nethics bears to traditional ethical theory, but there are already\nproblems that have been encountered by critical thinking\ninstructors that could have a profound impact on epistemol-\nogy.Thediscussionoftheseproblemswillprovidethesecond\nground for my claim.\nTo develop my claims about the parallels between applied\nethics and critical thinking, I must first give a more detailed\naccount of what I see as the situation in ethics. Subsequently,\nI will show how this categorization of ethics can be applied\ntoepistemologytoilluminatetherelationshipbetweencritical\nthinking and traditional epistemology.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 5 2. THE PARALLEL AND ITS IMPLICATION FOR CRITICAL\nTHINKING\n2.1. Ethics\nEthicscanbedividedintothreesubareas(exhibitingthetra-\nditional philosophical enthusiasm for tripartite distinctions):\nmeta-ethics, normative or theoretical ethics, and applied\nethics.Courses andtextsareoftendividedupthisway:sucha\nsubdivision of ethics is relatively uncontroversial.\n2.1.1. Meta-ethics\nBeyondtheanalysis ofbasic ethical concepts, meta-ethics is\nconcerned with the nature and foundation of ethical knowl-\nedge, particularly with the question of whether there is any\nethical knowledge.3 The difficulties in establishing a secure\nbasis for ethical claims has led many philosophers and even\nmore first year students to conclude that some kind of skep-\nticism or relativism is the only reasonable position. The argu-\nments for and against skepticism and relativism, Naturalism\nandIntuitionism,andargumentsgenerallyaboutthenatureof\nethical discourse fall under meta-ethics.\n2.1.2. Normativeor Theoretical Ethics\nNormative ethics, in contrast to meta-ethics, assumes that\nthereissomeethicalknowledgetobeacquired(oratleastthat\nthere are better and worse answers to ethical questions) and\nthatthisknowledgeisusuallyarticulatedinaprincipleorfun-\ndamental set of principles or norms. The job of the philoso-\n3.I thought this claim was unproblematic, but a commentator on my paper objected. In sup-\nport, I quote the following statement from William Frankena's classic introduction to\nethics:[Meta-ethics] asks and tries to answer logical, epistemological, or semantical ques-\ntions like the following: What is the meaning or use of the expressions \"(morally) right\" or\n\"good\"? How can ethical and value judgments be established or justified? Can they be justi-\nfied at all? What is the nature of morality? What is the distinction between the moral and\nthe nonmoral? (Frankena 1973, pp.5, 96; see also Brandt 1967, p.7).\n6MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN pherinthisareaistofindtheseprinciples,articulatethem,and\nshowthatthesearetheprinciplesthatanyethicallythoughtful\nperson should accept.\nNormative ethics has tended to bifurcate into two major\napproaches: consequentialism and the deontologism. Conse-\nquentialism, as its name implies, holds that the rightness or\nwrongnessofactsiswhollyafunctionoftheirconsequences.\nDeontologism (deon (Gr.) = duty) denies this claim insisting\nthat some acts are right or wrong independent of their con-\nsequences.Theprinciplerepresentativesofeachapproachare\nUtilitarianism and Kantianism. Both schools have tried to\nshow that this approach to ethical reasoning yields the cor-\nrect outcome in actual moral situations. However, their main\nemphasis has been to argue about imaginary problems and\nthought experiments\u2014some of them thoroughly bizarre. A\nmorepracticalapproachhasbeentakenbyJohnRawls(1971).\nHis effort to ground ethical norms in a decision procedure\nusing the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d is an excellent example of nor-\nmative ethics.4\n2.1.3. Applied Ethics\nWhilephilosophershaveobviouslybeenconcernedoverthe\ncenturieswithapplyingethicaltheoriestopracticalissues,the\nappearance of a sub-discipline devoted to this endeavor is of\nrecent vintage.\nThe original goal of applied ethics was to use the insights\nand principles of normative ethics to illuminate or even\nresolve issues of contemporary moral debate such as abortion\nand the allocation of scarce medical resources. But while this\nwas the intent of applied ethics, in practice the inadequacy of\nmany traditional moral theories and the difficulties in their\ninterpretation have resulted in the development of new\napproacheswhicharegroundedintheproblemsbeingstudied.\n4.Rawls also does quite a bit of applied ethics in this text.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 7 Therefore, the distinction between applied ethics and norma-\ntiveethicsisnotsomuchaconceptualoneasisthedistinction\nbetween meta-ethics and normative ethics, but rather one of\nfocus. Applied ethics focuses first on the ethical problem and\nonlythenontheethicaltheory.Thequestionforappliedethics\nis, first, what is the morally correct action in response to this\nsort of situation? and then, what are the correct principles of\nethical theory?\nOf course many great ethicists have written about everyday\nproblems,forexample,KantinhisLectures,orMillinhischap-\nter on \u201cApplications\u201d in On Liberty. In doing so, they were\nengaged in applied ethics, but they differed from contempo-\nrary applied ethicists in that these efforts were afterthoughts,\nrather than their central concern.\nTake the problem of abortion. One could start out with a\ntheory about the universal right to life and then puzzle over\nhow to apply it to a fetus. Or one could start, as various\nthinkers have, with the problem of trying to discern what the\nmorally relevant differences are (if any) between a fetus, a\ndying violinist (Thomson 1971), a human vegetable, and a\nzygote.This\u201cproblemfirst\u201dapproachisbothexcitingandillu-\nminating. One of the consequences of this approach has been\nan increased awareness of the problem of interpretation of\nethical norms in actual application. One may expect that new\nnormative theories might emerge from this effort; although\nthey may fall roughly into one of the normative camps, the\nemphasisonrealproblemsassuresthatthetheorieswillbetied\nto the rich factual base of ordinary and extraordinary prob-\nlems of everyday life.\nItisnotsomuchthemovetoapplyphilosophythatisexcit-\ning about applied ethics, but rather the feedback that these\nattemptedapplicationsgenerate.Bysensitizingustothediffi-\nculty of interpretation and the inadequacy of existing norma-\ntive theories, and by placing philosophers in positions where\n8MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN decisions must be made, applied ethics has inspired a renais-\nsance in ethical reflection.\nOne further distinction should be mentioned. There is\nethicsevenbeyondappliedethicaltheory,thatis,thereisbeing\nethical.Idonotseethemakingofindividualethicaljudgments\nabout,forexample,whethertohaveanabortioninaparticular\ncase,asbeingappliedethics.Thesearecasesofapplyingethics,\nyes,butnotaneventinthefieldofappliedethics.Ontheother\nhand, to the extent that someone criticizes an ethical decision\nonthebasisofthemisapplicationofethicalnorms(asopposed\ntofactualandlogicalerror),thisseemstomeanactivityinside,\nthoughneartheborderof,appliedethics.Thisdistinctionwill\nbecome important when I go on to discuss applied epistemol-\nogy.\nHowdoestheabovedivisionofethicscomparetoanappro-\npriate division in epistemology?\n2.2. Epistemology\nThere is not a parallel, well-established trichotomy in epis-\ntemology,butIhaveonetopropose,onedirectlyanalogousto\nthat of ethics.5\n2.2.1. Meta-Epistemology\nFirst,thereismeta-epistemology.Thisiswhatmostphiloso-\nphers think of under the general term of \u201cepistemology\u201d: the\nstudy of the central concepts of knowledge and the foun-\ndations of the theory of knowledge.6 Meta-epistemology\n5.A commentator on an earlier version of my paper brought to my attention an article by\nRichard Brandt (1967) in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy that draws similar parallels\nbetween meta-ethics and what he, too, calls meta-epistemology, and normative ethics and\nepistemology, though he makes no mention of applied ethics and, needless-to-say, no men-\ntion of applied epistemology.\n6.Hans Hansen has brought to my attention a 1982 paper by William P. Alston which makes\nthe same point:Recent epistemology has been heavily concerned with the conceptual and\nmethodological foundations of the subject\u2014in particular with the concepts of knowledge,\ncertainty, basic knowledge, justification, and so on. In other words, to a considerable extent\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 9 attendsprimarilytoepistemicdiscourseandit,too,canleadto\nskepticismaboutthepossibilityofknowledge.Ithasasitsgoal\nthe analysis of epistemological discourse as illustrated by the\ncontinuing efforts to discover the missing ingredients in the\ntraditionalanalysisofknowledgeasjustified,truebelief(illus-\ntrated in the puzzles of Gettier). Why it has not been called\nmeta-epistemology is not clear to me. This failure has tended\nto create the illusion that meta-epistemological concerns are\nthe central issues in the discipline of epistemology.\n2.2.2. Normative Epistemology\nNormativeepistemology7isalessdistinctarea,butthereare\na number of items that are specific to it. Like the normative\nethicist, the normative epistemologist assumes that there is\na solution to skeptical objections and proceeds to articulate\nwhat constitutes the correct basis of knowledge. As Brandt\nputs it:\n[Normative epistemologists] . . . have attempted to arrive at\nacceptable universal epistemological statements to be used as\nstandards in appraising particular statements (Brant 1967, p.6).\nWhile meta-epistemology is concerned with the role that\n\u201cjustified belief\u201d plays in the analysis of the concept of knowl-\nedge, normative epistemology is concerned to articulate the\nepistemological norms which delineate what kind and quan-\ntity of evidence one needs to have a \u201cjustified belief.\u201d\nHere one finds the traditional debate \u2014 between the ratio-\nnalists and intuitionists on one side, and the empiricists and\nit has been taken up with meta-epistemology, in contrast with substantive epistemology, in\ncontrast with questions about what we know, how we know it, and how various parts of our\nknowledge are interrelated. Just as with ethics, meta-inquiries have been pursued through-\nout the history of the subject..., but also as in ethics, meta concerns have been more promi-\nnent in twentieth century Anglo-American philosophy than ever before (Alston 1982,\np.275).\n7.Alston characterizes this as \"substantive epistemology,\" while Brandt describes it as \"episte-\nmology proper\" (Brant 1967, p.6).\n10MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN naturalists on the other side. It is a debate which very much\nparallels the one between the Kantians and the Utilitarians.\nThese various epistemological views have even had the same\ngeographic orientation as we saw in the ethical debate, in\nwhich Europeans prefer rationalism and intuitionism (and\nKantianism) and the Anglo/Americans prefer empiricism and\nnaturalism (and Utilitarianism).\nWork in the philosophy of science (and its sub-areas) seems\nto occupy a middle-ground: partly normative epistemology,\npartly applied epistemology. Grounded as it currently is in\nthe actual practice of scientists, it seems to reside naturally\nin applied epistemology, but its origins are in the efforts of\nbothrationalistsandempiriciststodiscoverabasisforscience\nwithout trying to ground it in the actual methods used by sci-\nentists.Thereis,forexamplesomethingwonderfullyrational-\nistic about Mill\u2019s methods which is little troubled by actual\nscientificactivity.Recentlythephilosophyofsciencehasgiven\ngreater emphasis to the actual way scientists assess claims\nwhichismoreanalogoustowhatgoesoninappliedethicsand,\nthus, closer to applied epistemology.\n2.2.3. Applied Epistemology\nI see applied epistemology as, first, attempting to apply the\ninsights of normative epistemology to the everyday pursuit\nof knowledge. This activity involves using normative episte-\nmological views (for example, the role that the elimination of\ncompetinghypothesesplaysindefendingacausalclaim)much\nmorethan\u201clogicalprinciples.\u201dInteachingcriticalthinking,we\nare,amongotherthings,promulgatingepistemologicalnorms.\nAndIthinkwefindourselvesinasomewhathappiersituation\nthan those who first set out to apply normative ethics.\nBy describing, for example, the role that the elimination of\ncompeting hypotheses plays, we can illuminate for our stu-\ndents important facts about the way scientists acquire knowl-\nedge and give them useful rules of thumb for assessing every-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 11 day causal claims. The well-established distinction between\nquestionsofhowscientificdiscoveriesaremadeandhowthey\nare established has many useful parallels in everyday life.\nAs indicated, much of the progress in philosophy of science\nhas resulted from actually attending to how scientists arrive\nat their knowledge of the world. It has produced support for\nrelativism (the recognition that scientific world views are\ngroundedintheculture(s)ofscience),butatthesametime,has\nyielded insights which have influenced working scientist (cf.\nthosescientistinfluencedbyKarlPopper).Theselaterinsights\nare on the border line between normative and applied episte-\nmology.\nHume\u2019s attempt to show that miracle claims can be dis-\nmissed a priori is a nice, though controversial, example of try-\ningtodoappliedepistemology.Similareffortstoapplyepiste-\nmology are often made in the magazine, The Skeptical Inquirer.\nThis magazine, while often concerned with the straightfor-\nward factual refutation of paranormal claims, also focuses on\nepistemological considerations such as the question of\nwhethertheclaimisfalsifiable.Theseareexamplesofapplying\nour epistemological understanding to illuminate and criticize\ndubious, everyday knowledge claims, and they are parallel to\ntheattempt toapplyethical principles tocontemporary issues\nin applied ethics.8\nFinally, I wish to emphasize the parallel between doing\nappliedepistemologyversusapplyingepistemology,anddoing\napplied ethics versus applying ethics. In applied ethics, for\nexample, we deal with abortion in general; in applying ethics\nwedecideontherightnessofaparticularabortion.Byanalogy\ninappliedepistemologywemightdealwithquestionsconcern-\ningtherolethattheeliminationofcompetinghypothesesplays\nin establishing a causal claim, but not the question of whether\nthisorthatparticularhypothesisshouldbe,orhasbeen,elim-\n8.An excellent recent example of doing applied epistemology (and also applied ethics) is\nCoady and Corry\u2019s The Climate Debate: An Epistemic and Ethical Enquiry (2013).\n12MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN inated.Ontheotherhand,aswithappliedethics,thecriticism\nof a particular view on an epistemological as opposed to fac-\ntual basis is a legitimate activity within applied epistemology.9\nBut my concern is not simply to draw the parallel between\ncriticalthinkingandappliedepistemology,buttousethisanal-\nogy to support the claim that the concerns of critical thinkers\nhavesignificantphilosophicalimport.Inparticular,theefforts\nto apply epistemological understanding to practical problems\nuncovers a number of difficulties within epistemology.\n3. SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR NORMATIVE\nEPISTEMOLOGY\nOneofthemostobviousfactsabouthowknowledgeisactu-\nally acquired is the heavy reliance on authority. Most of what\nwe know, we know because someone told us. This is out of\nline with the traditional emphasis on either reason or experi-\nenceasthebasisofknowledge.Whatisthestateofthetheory\nof appeal to authority? It hardly exists.10 But there other even\ndeeper problems. While great effort is expended on trying to\ndecide what else there is to knowledge besides justified true\nbelief,littletimeisspentonwhatwouldcountassufficientjus-\ntificationforabelieftobethebasisofaknowledgeclaim.The\n9.Harvey Siegel, in criticizing an earlier draft of this paper, argued that ethical questions such\nas \"What should I do?\" are answered by normative ethics, but that questions of \"What should\nwe believe?\" are not answered by normative epistemology\u2014hence my analogy was problem-\natic. This seems to me to miss the complexity of both kinds of questions. Obviously, factual\nconsiderations play a part in most ethical decisions and these are not the objects of ethical\ninquiry. Obviously also, observation, mathematics, and formal logical inference play a role\nin scientific investigation, and these are not the objects of epistemological reflection. But to\nthe extent that a doctor is misapplying ethical norms or concepts (perhaps through inade-\nquate justification), she is subject to ethical criticism and this could be justly done in a paper\nin applied ethics. Concomitantly, to the extent that a scientist is employing epistemological\nnorms in supporting her claims, both the application and content of these norms could\njustly be questioned by epistemologists\u2014applied or otherwise.\n10.After I wrote this, I read the article by John Hardwig (1985), which is an excellent first step\nto explicating the role that authority plays in scientific knowledge. Subsequently, I have\nwritten a paper, \"Assessing Expert Claims: Critical thinking and the Appeal to Authority\"\n(included in this volume), which attempts to develop a theory of appeals to authority. More\ncurrent work on appeals to authority can be found in Walton 2010.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 13 assumption may be that there is little in general that can be\nsaidabouttheruleswhichwouldspecifywhatevidencewould\nconstitute sufficient justification for a belief to be the basis of\na knowledge claim: that this question must be answered by\nprobability theory or intra-discipline norms. But, of course,\nit is just such a question that presents itself to us every day,\nand such questions do not always fall into some discipline\u2019s\n\u201djurisdiction.\u201d\u201cDoIhaveenoughevidencetoproceedwiththis\ninjunction, business decision, complaint, and so on?\u201d \u201cCan I\nsay \u201cI know\u201d he did it on the basis of the evidence that I have?\u201d\nArelatedissueariseswhenconsideringpeople\u2019sactualwill-\ningness to make knowledge claims. Our willingness to claim\nwe know something seems to be, at least partly, a function of\nwhatisatstake,weakerjustificationbeingsufficientforissues\nof lesser importance. I may say that \u201cI know you are coming\nat five\u201d simply on the basis of overhearing you say so, until I\ndiscover that my life depends on my being right. This point\nis related to Austin\u2019s insight that claiming to know is a kind\nof performative (Austin 1979). But Austin\u2019s claim is a descrip-\ntiveclaim,ameta-epistemologicalclaim.Thequestionapplied\nepistemology would treat would be: when is it reasonable to\nstake yourself behind your claim, to claim that you know?\nThese are crucial epistemological questions, questions that\nshould be addressed by philosophers, and questions that get\nmuch impetus when one attempts to apply epistemology to\nissues of everyday concern. These problems seem to me rich\nenough to justify the creation of a new field. Before we can\nadvance the teaching of critical thinking beyond the largely\nintroductory nature of current courses, these questions\nrequire deep, theoretical study.\n4. EXAMPLES OF APPLIED EPISTEMOLOGY\nThere may not appear to be as many clear examples of the\nneed for applied epistemology as there are examples of the\nkind of practical problems that requires applied ethics: med-\n14MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN icine, in particular, seems to supply enough moral problems\nto keep a legion of applied philosophers employed. But we\nreallyneednotlookfartofindanaloguesfortheappliedepis-\ntemologist. Lawisoneobviouscontextwhereputativefactual\nclaims are made and assessed in light of implicit and explicit\nepistemological norms. Much use is made, for example, of the\nfact/opiniondistinctionwhichWeddle(1985)hasshowntobe\nfraught with difficulty.\nDecisiontheorytoo,totheextentthatitinvolvesconsidera-\ntionsofrationalbeliefasabasisforaction,alsoinvolvesissues\nin applied epistemology. For example, the issue of the appro-\npriate 2nd order decision principle to apply (Type I or Type\nII) to the question of whether to believe a claim on the basis\nof evidence that is too weak to support a knowledge claim is\na question for applied epistemology. A lovely example of the\napplication of just such principals can be found in William\nJames\u2019 famous article \u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d (1896).\nAn excellent example of a text that takes critical thinking\nbeyond basic instruction is Giere\u2019s book, Understanding Scien-\ntific Reasoning (1984). Heelaborates afairlysophisticated view\nof the basis of scientific knowledge, and attempts, in a simpli-\nfiedbuttheoreticalway,toexplaintopeoplehowtoapplythis\napproachto(1)theoriesinthenaturalsciencessuchasphysics,\n(2) theories in the more statistically-based sciences such as\nepidemiology and sociology, and (3) popular theories such as\nDanekin\u2019s Chariot of the Gods. This is a highly commendable\nenterpriseandbecauseofitsexplicittheoreticalbase,hiswork\nissuperiortootherworkssuchasScienceandUnreason(Radner\nand Radner 1982), which are more superficial.\nInmyview,andperhapsinGiere\u2019scurrentview,thereistoo\nlittle emphasis on the role that the scientific community plays\nin assessing and establishing scientific knowledge. But what-\never the difficulties with his particular approach, the students\ndo learn a great deal from this careful and largely non-math-\nematical approach to science.11 They develop quite clear pro-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 15 cedures for assessing statistical information and good reasons\nto dismiss popular mythology like Danekin\u2019s. The difficulties\nand problems are grist for the applied epistemologist.\nAnothergoodexampleofappliedepistemologyisoneIhave\nalready alluded to: Hume\u2019s attack on miracles (1748, Sections\nVIII-XI.) Hume argues that no empirical evidence or testi-\nmony could be sufficient to overwhelm the essential improb-\nability of any claimed miracle. He also offers much historical\nevidenceaboutpeople\u2019smisguidedenthusiasmsforthemirac-\nulous and extraordinary. But his argument against the pos-\nsibility of justifying claims of the miraculous on the basis of\nfundamental epistemological considerations is an exemplary\ninstance of applied epistemology. This is not to say that his\nargument is uncontroversial; it is not an algorithmic applica-\ntion of well-established epistemological norms, but rather an\nargument which focuses on a particular set of judgments and,\nusingepistemologicalreflections,supportsaskepticalposition\non claims of this type.\nAnother instance of applying epistemological reflections\nwould be the use of the standards of statistical significance,\nespecially in the various social sciences. One example would\ntheuseofssd.05,whichstatisticianshavefixedonasthemin-\nimal standard for a \u201cscientific\u2019\u201d knowledge claim. The basic\nissueishowtodecidethesignificanceofstatisticsgatheredby\nsampling.WehaveallreadthatGalluppollstypicallyallowfor\na confidence interval of \u00b13% (19 times out of 20). This means\nthat Gallup is claiming that the percentage of the whole pop-\nulation holding a certain view will be within \u00b13% of whatever\npercentage Gallup\u2019s poll yield, 19 times out of 20 (i.e., 95% of\nthe time). We can then say that we know (or at least that we\nare justified in believing) that the range in the population is X\n\u00b13%. We can say this because the 95% rule has been adopted\n11.My own text, Is that a Fact? (Battersby 2016), also provides a non-mathematical introduc-\ntion to scientific reasoning that emphasizes the role of consensus in establishing scientific\nclaims.\n16MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN as the norm of statistical significance for most statistical pur-\nposes.Introductorystatisticsstudents,forexample,aretaught\nthat in the typical Gallup poll, changes in a politician\u2019s popu-\nlarityare(statistically)significantonlyiftheyexceed\u00b13%.But\nis this the appropriate criterion?

INTRODUCTION\nBlair and Johnson (1987b) have stated that an outstanding\nissueintheareaofargumentationishowargumentshouldbe\nconceived and further, whether there is one central notion of\nargument. In this paper it will be argued that from both an\nepistemologicalandapedagogicalperspective,argumentation\nis most usefully conceived as inquiry.\n2. EPISTEMOLOGY\nWhen viewed from the point of view of epistemology, the\nprocess of argumentation is, essentially, the process of\ninquiry, which I shall define, with Blair, as \u201can investigation\ninto whether a questioned or problematic point of view is\nacceptable\u201d (1987, p.193).12 There is a tendency in argumen-\ntation theory and pedagogy to emphasize the assessment of\narguments but it must be remembered that argumentation\nalsoinvolvestheconstructionofarguments andultimatelyof\nentire belief sets or views. It is the process whereby knowl-\n1.We subsequently define inquiry as \u201cthe process of carefully examining an issue in order to\ncome to a reasoned judgment\u201d (Bailin and Battersby 2016).\n2.In a later paper (2016), Blair suggests the terms \u201cinvestigation\u201d or \u201cexploration\u201d as an alter-\nnative to the term \u201cinquiry.\u201d\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 21 edgeisassessed,butitisalsotheprocesswherebyknowledge\nis constructed, and the evaluative and constructive dimen-\nsions are closely intertwined (Bailin 1987, 1988).3 In the\nprocess of argumentation, claims are put forth on the basis\nof reasons, the claims and reasons are challenged and tested,\ntheymaybereformulated,alternativeargumentsmaybepro-\nposed, these will be tested and perhaps reformulated, and in\nthe end a view is arrived at which takes into account the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the various arguments and syn-\nthesizes the strongest elements into a coherent whole (Bailin\n1990).Thisprocessmayalsoinvolvesomealterationinexist-\ning beliefs and is best viewed in the context of the larger\ndialectical process of belief formation and testing, as a\nmoment in that ongoing process (Blair and Johnson 1987a).\nThisdialecticalprocesscanhaveavarietyofformsinactual\npracticedependingonthecontext.Itmayinvolvetwoormore\nindividualsengagedinagenuineattempttoresolveadispute,\noneindividualengagedinattemptingtoresolveapuzzlement,\nortwoormoreindividuals arguing differentsides ofanissue\nwithout any intention to co-operate.\nThespeechactmodelofargumentation asputforthbyvan\nEemeren and Grootendorst (1983, 1992, 2004) takes as fun-\ndamental the first of these, that is the two party argumenta-\ntive discussion aimed at resolving a disagreement, and Blair\n(1987) argues that the other forms of argumentation can be\nassimilatedtothismodelaswell.Althoughitmayappearthat\nindividual inquiry would not fit the model since it does not\nnecessarily involve dialogue or dispute, Blair argues that it\ndoes, in fact, exhibit the requisite features. That this form of\nargumentation is conducted by one person does not alter the\nfact that it is a dual-role activity, although in this case both\nroles are occupied by a single person. Similarly, individual\ninquirydoesinvolvedisagreement,althoughthedisagreement\n3.See also \"Is Argument for Conservatives? or Where Do Sparkling New Ideas Come From?\"\nin this volume.\n22MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN in such cases arises from an incompatible view rather than\nfrom another individual. Blair further argues that the lack\nof public performance of the speech acts involved in argu-\nmentation is irrelevant since one would expect the inquirer\nto be able to reconstruct the various moves in the argumen-\ntative inquiry. Finally, Blair argues that argumentation con-\nducted with no intention to co-operate can fit van Eemeren\nand Grootendorst\u2019s model since the object of such argumen-\ntation may be to convince a third party rather than to resolve\na disagreement between the disputants. Thus Blair concludes\nthat a speech act analysis is applicable to all these cases of\nargumentation,andthat,fromthisperspective,allcanbeseen\nasinstancesofco-operativedispute-resolvingargumentation.\nI find this reasoning compelling with respect to viewing\nargumentation fromadiscourseanalysisperspective.Iwould\nargue,however,thatfromanepistemological perspective,the\nprocessinallthesecasescanbeviewedasoneofinquiry.The\ninquirymaybeundertakenbyonepersonorseveral,withthe\npossibility of people sharing roles or even exchanging roles;\nthedivision oflabour within theargument situation isirrele-\nvant. What is relevant is the epistemological structure, which\nis one in which knowledge claims are formulated, tested and\nadjusted in order to arrive at the best justified position.4\nIt may appear initially that the case of individuals involved\nin a disagreement would not conform to the inquiry model\nsince the aim of each might be to persuade the other of the\ncorrectness of his or her position rather than to inquire.\nNonetheless there are normative constraints on arguers in\nrational arguments (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1983,\n1992,2004),forexampleopennesstothepossibilitythatone\u2019s\nown position might not deserve acceptance or willingness to\nconcede to the most defensible position, which require that\nclaims be put to the test of reason and that those which are\n4.For more on the role of roles, see \u201cDAMed If You Do; DAMed If You Don\u2019t: Cohen\u2019s\n\u201cMissed opportunities\u2019\u201d in this volume.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 23 to be accepted be the ones which have the strongest warrant.\nThus, even if the psychological aim of the participants might\nbe to win, provided that they are willing to abide by the rules\nofco-operativeargument,theepistemologicalstructureofthe\nenterprise necessitates inquiry. Van Eemeran and Grooten-\ndorst\u2019s model, in viewing dispute-resolving argumentation as\nco-operative,recognizesthisdimension,andasBlairstatesin\nreferring to this model: \u201cThe parties resolve their disagree-\nments only if they are prepared to inquire together into the\nimplications of their different commitment stores\u201d (1987,\np.194). Indeed, the rules of dialectical interchange which van\nEemeren and Grootendorst propose are really rules which\nensure that the disputants, whatever their predisposition at\nthe commencement of the discussion, do in fact inquire.\nThese rules make explicit the inquiry dimension.\nMoreover, many of the points which Blair raises in the\ncourseofhisdiscussionseemtoreinforcethispointregarding\ntheprimacyofinquiry.Forexample,indiscussingaproposed\nrevision to van Eemeren and Grootendorst\u2019s rules, he states:\nThis similarity between solo inquiry and the revised model I\nam suggesting for multi-purpose dispute-resolving argumenta-\ntion is a point in favour of that revision, for it seems clear that\ndispute-resolving argumentation is possible only to the extent\nthat the disputing parties co-operate with a view to reaching\nagreement\u2013thatis,functionthewayasoloinquirerdoes(1987,\np.196).\nAt one point Blair is willing to view as a form of inquiry\nargumentative discussion in which the parties test beliefs by\nseeing how far they can be defended. He further states that\ndisputes in which each side aims to win ought ideally to be\npreceded by argumentative inquiry and are unjustified if not\nso conducted (1987, pp.191-2). Yet surely the latter are also\nunjustified if the participants do not abide by the rules of\nargumentative exchange, if they are not willing to concede\nto a stronger argument for example, and so ideally dispute-\n24MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN resolving argumentation is also a form of inquiry. Blair also\ndraws a comparison between inquiry and the type of argu-\nmentation undertaken to convince a third party or parties by\nstating that the judge or jury in the latter type of exchange\ndoesnotplayanadversarialroleintheproceedingsbutrather\nplays the role of an inquirer (1987, p.197).\n3. PEDAGOGY\nI have argued that, from an epistemological perspective,\nargumentationisbestseenasinquiry.Ialsobelievethatacon-\nception of argumentation as inquiry is helpful from a peda-\ngogicalperspectiveandthattherearegoodreasonsforstress-\ning the notion of inquiry in pedagogy related to argumenta-\ntion skills. Our goals, in teaching argumentative skills, are to\nhave students \u201cmanage their belief systems\u201d (Blair and John-\nson 1988) in a logical and intelligent manner,5 to engage in\nintellectual inquiry with skill and judgment, and to resolve\ndisputes in a co-operative and fair-minded way. Yet as teach-\ners of argumentation we realize what an exceedingly difficult\ntask this turns out to be. Students display strong tendencies\nto avoid challenge to their own beliefs, to ignore contrary\nevidence, to straw-person the beliefs of others, to refuse to\nconcede points, to start with conclusions and then look for\narguments to support them, to want to win at all costs.6 And\nperhaps these tendencies are not all that surprising given the\nimages which tend to be associated with arguments. Numer-\nous theorists have pointed out that the dominant metaphor\nforargumentinourcultureisthatofstruggle,usuallyviolent\n(Cohen 2014; Hundleby 2013; Rooney 2010).7 Thus Ayim\n5.Cf. Cohen\u2019s (2014) formulation of the goal as \u201cthe bettering of our cognitive systems\u201d and\nvan Radziewsky\u2019s (2013) as \u201cthe bettering of our belief systems.\u201d\n6.There is considerable contemporary research in cognitive science which confirms the exis-\ntence of these tendencies. See, for example, Kahneman 2011; Mercier and Sperber 2017. See\nalso our paper \u201cCritical Thinking and Cognitive Biases\u201d in this volume.\n7.See also \u201cDAMed If You Do; DAMed If You Don\u2019t: Cohen\u2019s \u201cMissed opportunities\u2019\u201d in this\nvolume.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 25 (1988) notes the ubiquity in academic argumentation of the\nlanguage of the battlefield, including talk of attack and\ndefense, of tearing apart opposing arguments, of having the\nupperhand,ofwinningthumbsdown.AndBlairdescribesthe\nsituation thus:\nWespeakof\u2018winning\u2019and\u2018losing\u2019theargument,\u2018winningsome-\noneover,\u2019\u2018knockdownarguments\u2019,and\u2018protagonists\u2019and\u2018oppo-\nnents\u2019. We regard it as something to be proud of to have \u2018won\u2019\nan argument, and conversely, something undesirable to have to\n\u2018concede a point\u2019 or \u2018admit defeat\u2019 (1987, p.193).\nMoreover,LakoffandJohnsonarguethatsuchlanguageuse\nis not incidental but actually shapes the practice:\nItisimportanttoseethatwedon\u2019tjusttalkaboutargumentsin\nterms of war. We can actually win or lose arguments. We see\nthe person we are arguing with as an opponent. We attack his\npositionsandwedefendourown.Wegainandloseground.We\nplanandusestrategies.Ifwefindapositionindefensible,wecan\nabandon it and take a new line of attack. Many of the things\nwe do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war.\nThough there is no physical battle, there is a verbal battle, and\nthe structure of an argument \u2013 attack, defense, counterattack,\netc. \u2013 reflects this. It is in this sense that the ARGUMENT IS\nWARmetaphorisonethatwelivebyinthisculture;itstructures\nthe actions we perform in arguing (1980, p.4).\nGrantedthatwe,astheoristsofargumentation,understand\nthatwhatwemeanwhenwetalkofargumentationentailsco-\noperation, open-mindedness and a willingness to concede to\nthestrongestreasons;nonethelessourstudentsareverylikely\nin the grip of the conception of argument as battle, a con-\nception which undermines open-mindedness and which may\nbeexceedinglydifficulttoovercome.ThusIwouldarguethat\nthere are pragmatic reasons for stressing that argumentation,\neven when it is conducted by two individuals disagreeing, is\nreally a process of joint inquiry into what the best position is\nand is a constructive enterprise.\n26MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN I would also argue that the concept of inquiry is preferable\ntothatofargumentwithrespecttothedevelopmentandpre-\nsentationofargumentation,anactivitywhichiscentraltovir-\ntually all academic enterprises. A common tendency among\nstudents writing argumentative papers is to conceive of the\ntask as that of arguing for a position and so to decide first\non a conclusion and then look for arguments to support that\nconclusion and ignore or downplay contrary evidence. The\ntenacity of this tendency despite our best pedagogical efforts\nis, I suggest, connected with the fact that the students gen-\nerally do not understand the nature of the process in which\nthey are engaged. They fail to understand it as a process of\ninquiryinwhichtheyaretryingfindsomethingout.Therules\nof good argument and of appropriate dialectical interchange\narehelpfulinprovidingguidanceastowhatmovesareappro-\npriate, but without an understanding of the epistemological\ngrounding for these rules, the entire enterprise likely strikes\nmany students as an arcane academic game for which they\nmust learn the rules in order to succeed.\nIt may also be the case that some aspects of the way argu-\nment construction is taught are not very conducive to the\ndevelopment of this type of understanding. For example, in\nthesectionofthetextLogicalSelf-Defensedevotedtoargument\nconstruction, a distinction is made between those arguments\nin which one begins with a settled position and those argu-\nmentswhichareformsofinquiry,meaningonehasnotmade\nup one\u2019s mind on a position. Yet to what extent is this really\na helpful distinction? Even in the former case, one cannot\nsimply look for arguments to support one\u2019s conclusion and\nignore contrary arguments, as Johnson and Blair (1983) fully\nacknowledge. Rather, one must assess the arguments for and\nagainst one\u2019s conclusion in a fair-minded manner, and must\nbe willing to modify or even abandon one\u2019s initial position in\nthe face of cogent counter-arguments. Thus even in the case\nwhen one begins the process with a position in mind, one\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 27 canholdthispositiononlyprovisionally,asahypothesistobe\ntested. In the case of argumentative inquiry, the text enjoins\none to begin with a position which seems to one to deserve\nserious consideration and to treat it as a hypothesis. I submit\nthat this is not significantly different from the process in the\nfirstcase.Theprimarydifferenceiswithrespecttothedegree\nofconvictionwithwhichtheinitialpositionisheld,butthisis\napsychologicaldifferenceandisnotonewhichhasanybear-\ning on the structure of the argumentation. In the final analy-\nsis, both are instances of inquiry.\nIntermsofpedagogy,Ibelievethatthereareproblemssep-\narating these out as two distinct kinds of arguments and not\nindicating that both are instances of inquiry. Giving students\nasensethatacentraltypeofargumentinvolvesmakingacase\nforapositiononealreadyholdswillverylikelyreinforcetheir\ndistorted beliefs about the nature of argumentation. Johnson\nand Blair do eventually inform students that they may have\nto qualify or even reject their initial position in light of com-\npelling objections, and, in a subsequent section outline the\nproblemsofcommitmenttoaviewandpostfactojustification\ninherent in beginning with a position already set. I suggest\nthat it might be preferable to begin with discussion of these\nissues, which are central to the epistemological structure of\nargumentation,andthengoontoframethetasknotinterms\nofconstructinganargumenttomakeacaseforapre-existing\nposition, but rather in terms of inquiry, to find out what the\nbest position is.\nIt might be objected that inquiry is an inappropriate\nmetaphor to guide the construction of an argumentative\npaper since what we want to see in a paper is the product of\nthe student\u2019s deliberation, not some reflection of the process.\nHow the ideas were arrived at is irrelevant; what we want to\nsee is the justification of the ideas. I would argue, however,\nthatsuchaseparation betweentheprocessofinquiryandthe\nproduct of deliberation is highly artificial. We are interested\n28MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN not simply in the conclusions of deliberation, but in the rea-\nsoning which leads to these conclusions. Thus the product\nthat we want to see is a reflection of the deliberative process.\nBlairmakesapointwhichlendssupporttothispositionwhen\ndiscussing whether someone engaged in individual inquiry\ncouldbeviewedasperformingthespeechactsconstitutiveof\nargumentation. He states:\nclearly,thesolitaryinquirerwhoneitherspeaksnorwritescan-\nnot literally perform these or any other speech act. However,\nshe does carry out mental operations strictly corresponding to\nthespeechactsperformedinverballyexplicitargumentativedis-\nputes.

But inquiry also involves adding, deleting,\nmodifying, and integrating beliefs. It is the process involved\nin the rational management of one\u2019s belief system (Blair and\nJohnson 1988). And it is a reflection of this process which we\nwant to see in students\u2019 papers (or at least a rational recon-\nstruction thereof).\nInquiry is the process we want students to use in arriving\nat their beliefs. Thus viewing argumentation as inquiry may\nbe of help in conveying to students a sense that constructing\nargumentsisnotsimplyanacademicexercisewhichisirrele-\nvant to everyday life but that argumentation is a way of con-\nstructing knowledge, a way of inquiring into and deciding\nwhat to believe and do both in the disciplines and in real-life\nsituations.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 29 REFERENCES\nAyim, M. 1988. \u201cViolence and Domination as Metaphors in\nAcademic Discourse.\u201d In Selected Issues in Logic and Commu-\nnication, edited by T.

What is the problem with Percy?\nMost current conceptions of critical thinking conceive of\ncriticalthinkingintermsofabilitiesanddispositions.Ibelieve\nthat such conceptions do not provide a way to understand\nwhat the problem is with Percy. I shall argue that a useful\nwaytothinkabouttheproblemisintermsofepistemological\nunderstanding, and that this way of thinking about the issue\ncan provide both pedagogical and conceptual grounding to\nefforts to foster critical thinking.\n2. CONCEPTUALIZING CRITICAL THINKING\nTwoconceptionsofcriticalthinkingwhichhavebeensem-\ninal for the field are those of Robert Ennis and of Harvey\nSiegel.BothEnnisandSiegelplacegoodreasonsatthecentre\noftheirconceptions.Ennis,forexample,highlightstheassess-\nment of reasons in his conception of critical thinking which\nhas been highly influential in the field. In his 1962 paper,\nEnnis defined critical thinking as \u201cthe correct assessing of\nstatements\u201d (Ennis 1962). Ennis subsequently broadened the\nscope of critical thinking with the following definition: \u201crea-\nsonablereflectivethinkingthatisfocusedondecidingwhatto\nbelieve or do\u201d (Ennis 1985, 1991, 2011, p.10). Harvey Siegel\nalso puts reason at the centre of his account of critical think-\ning.ForSiegelthecriticalthinkerisonewhoisappropriately\nmoved by reasons and one of the main aspects of critical\nthinking for Siegel involves the assessing of reasons (Siegel\n1988, 1997).\nWhen actually detailing what precisely constitutes such\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 33 criticalthinking,bothSiegel\u2019sandEnnis\u2019sanalysesareframed\nin terms of an ability component and a dispositional compo-\nnent. Siegel terms these two dimensions the reason assess-\nment component and the critical spirit. For Siegel the reason\nassessment component is central to critical thinking and\ninvolvestheabilityproperlytoassessreasonsandtheirability\nto warrant beliefs, claims and actions. The critical spirit,\nwhichSiegelviewsasbeingofequalimportancewiththerea-\nson assessment component, indicates that the thinker values\ngood reasons and is disposed to assess reasons and to gov-\nernbeliefsandactionsonthebasisofsuchassessment(Siegel\n1988). Ennis elaborates on the reason assessment dimension\nwith a list of specific abilities which is categorized under the\nheadings elementary clarification, basic support, inference,\nadvancedclarification,andstrategiesandtactics,andincludesthe\nfollowing: 1) focusing on a question; 2) analyzing arguments;\n3) asking and answering questions of clarification and chal-\nlenge; 4) judging the credibility of a source; 5) observing and\njudging observation reports; 6) deducing and judging deduc-\ntions; 7) inducing and judging inductions; 8) making and\njudgingvaluejudgments;9)definingtermsandjudgingdefin-\nitions;10)identifyingassumptions;11)decidingonanaction;\nand 12) interacting with others (Ennis 1985). Ennis also\nincludes a list of tendencies or dispositions in his conception\nof critical thinking which includes: the disposition to seek a\nclear statement of the statement or question, to seek reasons,\nto try to be well-informed, to use credible sources and men-\ntion them, to take into account the total situation, to try to\nremain relevant to the main point, to keep in mind the orig-\ninal or basic concern, to look for alternatives, to be open-\nminded,totakeapositionwhentheevidenceandreasonsare\nsufficient,toseekasmuchprecisionasthesubjectpermits,to\ndeal in an orderly manner with the parts of a complex whole,\nand to be sensitive to the feelings, level of knowledge, and\ndegree of sophistication of others (Ennis 1994).\n34MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Both Siegel\u2019s and Ennis\u2019s accounts are prototypical in ana-\nlyzing critical thinking in term of abilities and dispositions.\nCan the problem with Percy be accounted for in terms of a\ndeficit in such abilities or dispositions?\n2.1. Abilities\nLet us consider first the possibility that the problem with\nPercy lies in the area of abilities. Are there specific abilities\nwhich Percy is lacking which account for his problem with\ncritical thinking? We have no way of knowing whether Percy\nis able to handle equivocation appropriately, judge the cred-\nibility of a source, or deduce, and judge deductions, to draw\nfrom Ennis\u2019s list (Ennis 1994, 2013). It may be that he is able\nto accomplish these and similar tasks in particular contexts.\nEven if he cannot, it does not seem to be a lack of these par-\nticular kinds of abilities which would account for the type of\nproblem which Percy exhibits.\nMight his problem be that he is unable to analyse argu-\nments, that he cannot identify premises and conclusions? Yet\nhe might be able to make such an identification in particular\ncontexts, for example in a textbook exercise. In fact, he may\neven in the end be successful, in his paper for MY class, at\nbasing his conclusions on reasons and evidence. His problem\nwithargumentgoesdeeperthananinabilitytoanalyseandto\nidentifytheparts.Hedoesnotunderstandtheroleofpremises\nand conclusions within an argument nor the conceptual con-\nnection between them. In fact, he does not really understand\nwhat an argument is.\nPerhaps Percy\u2019s problem can be captured in terms of an\ninability to \u201cintegrate the other abilities and dispositions in\nmaking and defending a position\u201d (Ennis 1994, p.2) or, more\nbroadly,asafailureinthereasonassessmentcomponent.Yet,\nasmentionedabove,hemaybeabletopullitoffinparticular\ncontexts.Moreover,thisdiagnosisoftheproblemwouldbeso\nbroad and general as to be unhelpful. It would not pinpoint\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 35 the source of the problem. We would still want to know why\nhe could not effect such an integration. It would have little\nexplanatory power and provide little guidance in terms of\npedagogical remedy.\n2.2. Dispositions\nLet us consider the possibility that the problem with Percy\nstems from a dispositional deficiency. Perhaps his problem is\nthat he is not disposed to assess reasons and to govern his\nbeliefs and actions on the basis of such assessment. Now he\nmight be disposed to apply the relevant criteria of reason-\nassessment in certain contexts. For example, if he comes\nacross and recognizes a deductive argument, he might be\ninclined to evaluate it appropriately. If he encounters an\nobservationalreport,hemightbedisposedtojudgeitaccord-\ning to relevant criteria. And if he discovers that another pro-\nfessor has a similar idiosyncrasy to mine and also wants stu-\ndentstobasetheirconclusionsonreasonsandevidence,then\nhe may well be inclined to do so. We don\u2019t know if, indeed,\nhe would, but nothing we know about his story would pre-\nclude such possibilities. Nor do we know to what extent he\napplies relevant criteria in his daily life, e.g., when buying a\nstereo.Whatwedoknow,however,isthatbasingaconclusion\nonreasonsandevidenceisnot,forPercy,ageneralizeddispo-\nsition.\nIsPercy\u2019sproblemthathelackssuchcriticalthinkingdispo-\nsitions as open-mindedness, fair-mindedness, or intellectual\nhonesty?Itistruethathisworkwasnotmarkedbyafairand\nopenappraisalofopposingviews.Butthisdoesnotappearto\nbeafailingintermsofopenness,fairnessorhonesty.Itseems,\nrather, to be a lack of understanding that such a weighing is\nwhat is called for. Percy did not get far enough into the prac-\ntice for such dispositions to be at issue.\nIt does seem correct to say that Percy lacks a critical spirit.\nOnecouldnotdescribehimascommittedtocriticalthinking,\n36MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN as valuing good reasons, as caring to get it right. Yet such a\ndiagnosisisonlymarginallyhelpful.Itstilldoesnotgetatthe\nheart of Percy\u2019s problem. It does not tell us why he does not\nvalue critical thinking. Indeed, Percy\u2019s case seems to be quite\ndifferent from some others which might be similarly diag-\nnosed, e.g., individuals who fail to think critically out of self-\ninterest, or individuals whose biases blind them from being\nopen-minded.ItisnotsomuchthatPercydoesnotcareabout\ngood reasons. Rather, it is that Percy does not appreciate the\nrole of reasons in inquiry and knowledge.1\n3. EPISTEMOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING\nI would argue that the problem with Percy is essentially an\nepistemological one. He does not understand the enterprise\nof knowledge creation and evaluation, an enterprise which is\nconstituted by the offering and assessing of reasons. He may\nhave some basic grasp of concepts such as reason, evidence,\nargument and conclusion, but he does not fully understand\ntheir meaning, grasp the conceptual connection between\nthem,norappreciatetheroletheyplayinthelargerprocessof\ninquiry.Thus,forexample,hedoesnotfullyunderstandwhat\nconstitutesaconclusion,failingtoappreciatethatitisnotjust\na statement which comes at the end of an argument, but that\nitisconceptuallytiedtonotionssuchasreasonsandevidence.\nHe cannot distinguish between opinion and reasoned judg-\nment because he does not have a developed concept of justi-\nfication and its relationship to knowledge. He does not know\nhowtousesourcesbecausehedoesnotunderstandtheepiste-\nmological status of the claims made by others. Without some\nappreciation of the nature of inquiry, without a larger episte-\nmological picture in which to situate these practices, what I\naskofhimmustseemlikeanarcanegamewitharbitraryrules.\nIt might be objected that Percy must, in fact, have some\n1.See our paper, \u201cReason Appreciation\u201d in this volume.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 37 understandingofconceptssuchasconclusion,argument,and\njustification. He doubtless engages in arguments in many\naspectsofhislife,forexampleargumentsregardingthemerits\nof various stereo systems or the strengths and weaknesses of\nvarioushockeyplayers.Andhedoubtlessoffersreasonsjusti-\nfying his preferences and evaluates conflicting reasons in the\nprocess. The problem with Percy, it might be argued, is sim-\nply that he does not apply critical thinking in the context of\nschooling.\nNow this is certainly to some extent the case. It would be\ngoing too far to claim that Percy has no concept of argument\nor justification. He would be unable to function in his daily\nlifewithoutsuchconcepts.Nonetheless,hisunderstandingof\nthese concepts appears very limited. He seems to have only a\nsuperficial grasp of what it means to justify a claim and his\nunderstanding does not generalize to a wide variety of con-\ntexts.\nMoreover, the problem does not reside simply in a failure\ntograspsomeparticularconceptsuchasjustification.Rather,\nthe enterprise of critical thinking is constituted by an entire\nwebofinterconnectedconcepts(e.g.,reasons,evidence,argu-\nment, justification, warrant, premise, conclusion, opinion).\nThese concepts are connected, in turn, to certain principles\nandprocedures,andalltheprecedingareconnectedtocertain\npurposes.Itisthiswholeinterconnectednetworkofconcepts,\nprinciples, procedures and purposes which have eluded\nPercy\u2019s grasp.\nLet us return, however, to the objection cited earlier that\ntheproblemwithPercyisnotsomuchanepistemologicalone\nhaving to do with his conceptual understanding, but rather\nhas to do with his failure to apply critical thinking in an aca-\ndemiccontext.Onthisinterpretation,Percyisabletoengage,\nat least to some extent, in the practice of critical thinking\nin his daily life, but has failed to see the academic context\nas an appropriate venue for critical thinking. It is likely that\n38MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN his previous schooling experience did not promote or expect\nmuch critical thinking nor engage him to any extent in ratio-\nnal inquiry. Thus Percy has not been properly initiated into\nthe practice of thinking critically in an academic setting. One\nmight wonder, however, to what extent he actually engages\nin sustained reason-giving, evaluation and challenge even in\nhis daily decisions (e.g., in voting). The kind of evaluation of\ncompeting claims and opposing arguments which is required\nin academic writing is not all that different from the kind of\nevaluation required in assessing complex issues in daily life.\nThus one might be justified in suspecting that Percy has a\nproblem with critical thinking even in these contexts. Percy\nhaslikelynotbeenproperlyinductedintothepracticeofcrit-\nical thinking even in everyday contexts.\nOn this reading, then, critical thinking is viewed primarily\nas a practice which one learns through being inducted into\nthe practice (Selman 1993). The kind of failure to understand\nwhich seems to characterize Percy\u2019s performance would be\nviewed as a failure to see the point of the practice. Moreover,\nonthisview,thepracticecanonlybeappreciatedfromwithin.\nThus the problem with Percy would be seen not so much as\na lack of prior epistemological understanding, but rather as\na failure to get on the inside of the practice of critical think-\ning in order to appreciate the goods internal to it (MacIntyre\n1984).2\nIbelievethatitisveryplausibletoviewcriticalthinkingasa\npractice,andassuchitisapracticeconstitutedbythenetwork\nof concepts, principles, procedures, and purposes described\nearlier. And Percy has clearly failed to get the point of the\npractice. Yet it is important to recognize that the practice is\nessentially epistemological in nature, involving as it does the\nevaluation of claims to knowledge. Thus getting the point of\n2.Critical thinking encompasses goods which are external to the practice as well as internal,\nas Kvernbekk (2008) points out. See \u201cFostering the Virtues of Inquiry\u201d in this volume.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 39 the practice means understanding something about episte-\nmology.\nItmightbeobjectedthatframingtheissueintermsofepis-\ntemologyistoonarrow.Itcanbearguedthatcriticalthinking\ntakesplaceinavarietyofcontexts,e.g.,morality,science,law,\nandthatwhatisrequiredisinitiationintothisvarietyofprac-\ntices and understanding the point of each, not simply under-\nstanding epistemology. Now it is certainly the case that the\npracticeswhichinstantiatecriticalthinkingaremanyandvar-\niedandinvolveadiversityofconcepts,principles,procedures\nand purposes which students must come to understand and\nappreciate. But what these practices have in common is that\ntheyareallcriticalpractices.Whateverelsetheymayinvolve,\nthey also importantly involve the evaluating of reasons, the\njustifying of claims, and the making of judgments. And to the\nextent that they do so, they all have a major epistemological\ndimension.\nItisimportanttobeclearatthispointthatIamnotarguing\nthatwhatisrequiredinordertothinkcriticallyissomeprior\nunderstanding of epistemology. I am not claiming that one\nneeds a course in epistemology before ever engaging in the\nactivity of critical thinking nor that simply teaching students\naboutepistemologywillenablethemtounderstandthenature\nof the enterprise. Certainly an immersion in the practice is\nfundamental to the acquisition of the kind of understanding\nwhich is at issue. However that immersion must consist in\nmore than an acquisition of abilities. It must focus, as well,\non the development of this understanding. One might fruit-\nfully draw a parallel here with Aristotle\u2019s contention that one\nbecomes just by performing just actions, but that one must\nperformtheminthewayinwhichthejustpersonwould,that\nis, with an understanding of their justification (Nicomachean\nEthics, Bk. 11, Chpts. 3 & 4). Analogously, it may be the case\nthatonebecomesacriticalthinkerbyengaginginthepractice\nofthinkingcritically,butonemustdothisinthewayinwhich\n40MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN the critical thinker would, that is, with an understanding of\nthenatureofandjustificationforthepractice,andthiswould\nentail some sort of explicit awareness of its epistemological\nunderpinnings.\nIt may be relevant, at this juncture, to highlight how the\nviewwhichIamdevelopingdiffersfromsomeofthestandard\nviews of critical thinking. It differs substantially from that of\nEnnis in that the notion of epistemological understanding is\nnot explicitly present in his account. Siegel, however, does\nargue for the importance of epistemology, and our views are\nthus compatible. Nonetheless, there is a difference in focus\nwhichisofconsequencebothconceptuallyandpedagogically.\nSiegel\u2019s analysis is framed in terms of a reason assessment\ncomponent and a dispositional component. Knowing about\nepistemology, conceived of in terms of \u201ca theoretical grasp\nof the nature of reasons, warrant, and justification\u201d is part of\nthe reason assessment component (Siegel 1988, p.35). In my\nanalysis, epistemological understanding is not simply a sub-\ncomponent. Rather it is the central concept through which\ncriticalthinkingisconceptualized.Itisthatwhichunderpins,\njustifies, and makes sense of the activities and dispositions\nrelatedtoreasonassessment.Theseactivitiesanddispositions\nare grounded in the understanding. Thus the critical thinker\nis one who understands about the evolution and evaluation\nof knowledge and who believes and acts according to this\nunderstanding.Thelatterinvolvespossessingcertainkindsof\nknowledge and being able to and disposed to do certain sorts\nof things, but it is understanding, rather than skill, which is\nthe central explanatory concept.3\nSuch a difference in conceptualization may also have edu-\ncational consequences. Siegel states that \u201ceducation aimed at\nthe development of critical thinking \u2026 must seek to foster a\nhost of attitudes, emotions, dispositions, habits and charac-\n3.For a critique of skills-focused conceptions of critical thinking, see Bailin 1998.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 41 ter traits as well as a wide variety of reasoning skills\u201d (Siegel\n1988, p.41). I believe, however, that a pedagogical focus on\nthese as the constitutive components might serve to obscure\nsome important aspects of critical thinking. It could result in\na failure to give sufficient attention to the conceptual net-\nwork which underpins critical thinking, a failure to connect\nthe activities and abilities of critical thinking to the purposes\noftheendeavour,and,moregenerally,afailuretosituatethese\nactivities and abilities within the context of the wider enter-\nprise of knowledge creation and evaluation. Thus, students\nmay fail to gain an understanding of the sort of larger episte-\nmological picture in which to situate the particular practices,\nand this is precisely the problem which Percy exhibits.\nTo say this is to acknowledge that there is an epistemo-\nlogical picture (or range of pictures) in which the activities\nof critical thinking are situated, a number of epistemological\nassumptions whichareimplicit inthepractice. These include\na belief in reason, a belief in the possibility of rational justifi-\ncation in terms of the criteria and standards inherent in our\ncritical practices, a belief in the desirability of acting on the\nbasisofrationallyjustifiedbeliefs,andabeliefthatanyofour\nparticularbeliefsorcriteriacouldbemistakenorinappropri-\nate.\nThere are, similarly, certain epistemological beliefs which\nareincompatible with the enterprise ofcritical thinking. One\noftheseisthebeliefthatknowledgeiscertainandcomesfrom\nauthority.4 This belief leaves no room for a rational assess-\nment of claims and thus precludes critical thinking. Another\ntype of position which is incompatible with critical thinking\nis radical relativism, in its various guises. The naive relativist\n4.I take the point made by Battersby (1993) that we do, in fact, rely on authority for much of\nour knowledge, but authority is here relied on as an intermediary source of knowledge\nwhen the means for rationally assessing the knowledge claims themselves is beyond our\nreach. The assumption is that the experts have themselves reached their conclusions based\non reasoned assessment and that there are criteria for critically assessing their expertise and\nbasis for judgment.\n42MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN views all opinions as subjective expressions of preference\nwhich are equally valid. The enterprise of critical thinking\nmakes no sense in this context (Siegel 2011). An interesting\nvariation on the above is the view that there is a domain of\ncertainknowledgewhichisascertainedthroughauthorityand\nthat everything else is a matter of subjective opinion. This,\nin fact, seems to be the position implicit in Percy\u2019s faltering\nattempts at writing his philosophy of education paper. There\nare, of course, more sophisticated versions of the radical rel-\nativist position, for example the kind of postmodern view\nwhich totally rejects reason. Someone holding this position\nmightwellutterthesamestatementasPercy:\u201cOh!SoinTHIS\nclass, YOU want us to base our conclusions on reasons and\nevidence.\u201d But this statement would not represent a lack of\ncomprehension of the nature of the enterprise as it did for\nPercy, but rather a rejection of its legitimacy.\nThis connection between critical thinking and epistemo-\nlogicalbeliefsissupportedbysomeofKuhn\u2019sempiricalinves-\ntigations of argument skills (Kuhn 1991, 1999). Kuhn dis-\ncovered a correlation between what she terms an evaluative\nepistemology \u2014 one which \u201cdenies the possibility of certain\nknowledge\u201d(1991,p.187)butwhich\u201creflectstheunderstand-\ning that viewpoints can be compared with one another and\nevaluated with respect to their adequacy or merit\u201d (1991,\np.188) \u2014 and argumentative skill development. The explana-\ntion she suggests for this correlation parallels the argument\noffered above:\nIf knowledge is entirely objective, certain, and simply accumu-\nlates, as the absolutist believes, or if knowledge is entirely sub-\njective and subject only to the tastes and wishes of the knower,\nas the multiplist believes, argument is superfluous. There is no\nneed or place for the comparative weighing and evaluation of\nalternativeclaimsthatisattheheartofskilledargument...Only\nif knowledge is seen as the product of a continuing process of\nexamination,comparison,evaluation,andjudgmentofdifferent,\nsometimescompeting,explanationsandperspectivesdoesargu-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 43 ment become the foundation upon which knowing rests (Kuhn\n1991, pp.201-202).\n4. JUSTIFICATION\nI would want to claim, then, that there are certain assump-\ntions which underpin our practice of critical thinking and\ngivecoherencetotheparticularelements,andthatdiscussion\nof this epistemological dimension has tended to be neglected\nin the way critical thinking has been thought about and\ntaught. And I have outlined above some of the reasons why\nI believe it makes pedagogical sense to communicate these\nassumptions to our students. But I also believe that there is a\nmoral reason for engaging these epistemological issues with\nour students. In teaching critical thinking, we are attempting\nto promote certain behaviours and attitudes. We are trying\nto get students to evaluate claims on the basis of certain cri-\nteria, and, more generally, to act from such an assessment\nrather thanfromvarious alternativessuchasimage, intuition\nor authority. We are also trying to get students to adopt cer-\ntain values, for example to value open-mindedness, accuracy,\ntruth, and reason. We further believe that we have good rea-\nsons for so doing, and these reasons are connected with the\nway we view the nature of the enterprise and with the kinds\nof epistemological assumptions outlined above, for example\na belief in reason and a belief in the desirability of acting on\nrationallyjustifiedbeliefs.NowasSiegelhaspointedout,one\nof the obligations incumbent upon us as teachers attempting\nto promote critical thinking is the obligation to provide stu-\ndents with our reasons for what we do in class and what we\nrequire of them (Siegel 1988, p.45; 1995). This would imply\nthat we have an obligation to provide students with our rea-\nsons for promoting critical thinking.\nIt has been argued by some, however, that critical thinking\nisnotthekindofthingwhichrequiresajustification.Selman,\nfor example, asks if anyone could seriously dispute the desir-\n44MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ability of being able to reason well and further states that\nthe value of critical thinking does not need to be justified to\nsomeonewhoisgenuinelytakingpartinthepractice(Selman\n1993, pp.63-64). Yet the value of critical thinking does seem\nto be an issue of dispute in contemporary society. Indeed, a\nflight from reason is evident in many ways, from the spread\nof religious fundamentalism to the proliferation of new age\nphilosophy.Moreover,thekindofpostmodernistviewwhich\nrejects rationality seems to be precisely a case of those who\nhave genuinely taken part in the practice of critical thinking\nthenrejectingthepractice.Inanycase,inrecommendingthat\nwe discuss with our students our reasons for promoting crit-\nical thinking, I do not necessarily mean offering a meta-level\njustification of rationality (although engaging in that discus-\nsion may be worthwhile as well). Rather, I mean giving stu-\ndents a sense of why we want them to do particular sorts of\nthingsandhowweseewhatwewantthemtodoasrelatedto\nthenatureandpurposesoftheenterprise.Thismeans,Ithink,\nengaging with the epistemological issues.\n5. CONCLUSION\nWhat,then,istheproblemwithPercy?Itis,essentially,that\nthe nature of the enterprise of critical thinking has escaped\nhim.Hehasnotunderstoodthepracticeinanydeeporcoher-\nentway,andthisisdespitethefactthathemaybeabletoand\neven disposed to engage in reason assessment in particular\ncontexts.Thisseemstometoindicatethatabilitiesanddispo-\nsitionsarenottheappropriateunitsoffocuswhenconceptu-\nalizing critical thinking.5 Although there is certainly merit in\ndetailing particular elements orattributes whichareinvolved\ninthinkingcritically,6morefundamentalisanappreciationof\n5.For a further elaboration of some of the problems with \"skills and dispositions\" accounts,\nsee Bailin et al. 1999a.\n6.For an alternative approach to detailing the aspects involved in critical thinking, see Bailin\net al. 1999b; Bailin and Battersby 2016.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 45 the nature of the enterprise.

Their ideas have generated and inspired a great deal of\nresearch focusing on both the conceptualization of argument\nand the teaching of argumentation. In this paper, we would\nliketoextendthatworkbydevelopingadimensionofreason-\ning which is seldom made explicit \u2013 that of the appreciation\nof reason. Reason appreciation involves a respect for reason-\ning based on an understanding of its nature, role and signifi-\ncance,andarecognition ofitssubtleties andaesthetic aspects.\nA full appreciation of reason has both cognitive and affective\ndimensions.Reasonappreciationshouldbeoneofthegoalsof\ncritical thinking instruction.\n2. WHY A NEW CONCEPT IS NEEDED\nThe reason we think that the idea of reason appreciation is\nimportantmightbestbedemonstratedbyapedagogicalexam-\nple. Elsewhere, one of the authors has described the problem\nofastudentwhoishavingdifficultyconstructinganargumen-\ntative essay (Bailin 1999). He has trouble understanding that\n48MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN such an essay can be anything other than a summary of other\nauthors\u2019views,orthesamewithhisownunsupportedopinion\ntacked on the end. But the realization does finally come that\nthere ought to be some sort of connection between the points\nmadeinthebodyofthepieceandtheconclusiondrawnatthe\nend: \u201cOh! So you want us to base our conclusions on reasons\nandevidence!!!\u201dAnyfeelingofpedagogicalsuccessonthepart\nof the instructor was, however, premature. \u201cOH! So in THIS\nclass, YOU want us to base our conclusions on reasons and\nevidence.\u201d\nNow the problem with this student does not seem to be\ncaptured in terms of an inability properly to assess reasons.\nThestudentmight,indeed,havetheabilitytoidentifyfallacies\nor evaluate inferences given the right circumstances (e.g., if\ninstructed to that end and then asked to do so in particular\nexamples). It does not seem to be a lack of these types of\nabilities that is the problem here. Such an example seems to\nus, rather, to be a case of someone who does not appreciate\nreason. As a consequence, he does not respect its normative\ndemands nor is he appropriately motivated to adopt its prac-\ntice. He fails to appreciate what reasoning is all about.\n3. DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER CONCEPTS\nNumerouscriticalthinkingtheoristshavearguedthatthere\nis more to being a competent reasoner than having the ability\nto evaluate arguments, and most have attempted to charac-\nterize this aspect in terms of a dispositional component. This\ndispositional component has several dimensions. One is an\noverarching commitment to reason, well captured by Siegel\u2019s\nnotionofcriticalspirit(Siegel1988).Theseconddimensionis\nbehavioural:thecriticalthinkerisinclinedtoactinaccordance\nwith norms of reason (Ennis 1996a; Siegel 1988). In addition,\nsome of the dispositions proposed by theorists seem to point\nto an attitudinal and even ethical aspect, for example open-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 49 mindedness, fair-mindedness, a commitment to critical dia-\nlogue, and sensitivity to the feelings of others (Ennis 1996a).\nThe phenomenon which these theorists are pointing to\nthrough their use of the concept of disposition has some sig-\nnificant overlap with the phenomenon we are attempting to\ncapturethroughourconceptofreasonappreciation.Nonethe-\nless,webelievethatreferringtothisdimensionintermsofdis-\npositions is not particularly helpful.\nThe notion of disposition is used to describe a behaviour,\nindicatingthatthepersonactuallybehavesinacertainway.1It\ncan sometimes also be used to refer to some quality or prop-\nerty of an individual by virtue of which the person behaves in\nthe manner indicated (Siegel 1999).\nNeither formulation seems entirely satisfactory as a way to\ncapture the dimension of reasoning which we have in mind.\nPositingadispositiondoesindicatethatanindividualactually\ndoesengageinthebehaviourinquestion,inthiscaseassessing\nreasons appropriately in a variety of contexts, and this is cer-\ntainly part of what we are after. It tells us nothing, or very\nlittle, however, about why the person tends to behave in this\nway. The property sense does rule out explanations based on\nexternal causes, but it would not rule out cases in which the\npersonhasatendencytoengageinreasonassessmentbecause\nthey have assimilated some external forces, for example, if\nthey have been indoctrinated or if they want to live up to\ntheirteacher\u2019sexpectations(evenifteacherisnolongeronthe\nscene). These are significantly different from behaving in this\nway because they understand something about reason assess-\nment and why it is important. And since it does not elaborate\ninanydetailwhythepersonhasthistendencytoact,itspeda-\ngogical usefulness is limited.\nThis notion of disposition gains its currency from Quine\u2019s\nconceptualization of dispositions in the physical realm (Siegel\n1.Ennis, for example, defines dispositions thus: \u201cRoughly speaking, a disposition is a tendency\nto do something, given certain conditions\u201d (Ennis 1996b).\n50MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN 1999). According to Quine, \u201ca dispositional term is a promis-\nsory note for an eventual description in mechanical terms\u201d\n(1973, p.14) and it is the eventual elaborated mechanical\ndescriptionwhichwilldotheexplanatorywork.2Inthecaseof\ncritical thinking, however, it is not a mechanical explanation\nin terms of neurons etc. which is at issue. A promissory note\nisnotrequiredbecauseweknowfullwellhowtocashitout\u2013\nintermsofunderstanding,beliefs,values,andattitudes.More-\nover,suchconceptsarepedagogicallyuseful.Itistheparticular\nset of such understandings, beliefs, values and attitudes\nrequired for reasoning well which we are trying to capture\nthrough the notion of appreciation.\n4. THE CONCEPT OF APPRECIATION\nBefore indicating what the concept of appreciation would\nadd to instructional goals in teaching reasoning, we need to\nelucidate the concept itself. \u201cAppreciate\u201d is etymologically\nderived from the word \u201cto value\u201d \u2014 to know the value of\nsomething.Ithascometomeanmorethanthat,butstillholds\nthat basic meaning. Its secondary meaning is to be sensitive\nto subtleties and distinctions \u2014 what many dictionaries refer\nto as \u201cdelicate perception\u201d. This sensitivity to the underlying\nqualities of an object or enterprise is often the basis for the\nvaluing or \u201cappreciation\u201d of it. To appreciate something\nrequires knowing enough about a topic to understand (appre-\nciate) what is valuable about it.\nIn explicating our concept of reason appreciation, we are\ndrawinganexplicitanalogytotherealmofartasthisisanarea\nwhere the notion of appreciation plays a central role. Appre-\nciatingartinvolvesunderstandingitsvalueasanenterpriseas\nwell as understanding the value of particular works. Appre-\nciation involves more than pure intellectual understanding,\n2.Siegel implies that the situation is similar for critical thinking dispositions, that a reference\nto such dispositions is a kind of place-holder until science tells us more about what consti-\ntutes such dispositions (Siegel, p.211).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 51 however.Italsomeans,importantly,\u201cgetting,\u201datanemotional\nlevel, what a work has to offer.\nThe foundation for appreciating art lies in knowing what\nmakes a piece of art actually work. In the case of visual art,\nthis would include knowledge of the elements of art such as\ncolour, line, and composition; some knowledge of materials\nand techniques; an understanding of the relevant artistic tra-\ndition and how the work fits into it; and some understanding\nofthenatureoftheenterprise.Thistypeofknowledgedirects\ntheviewer\u2019sattentiontorelevantfeaturesofthework(delicate\nperception) and may enable the viewer to make discrimina-\ntions and notice aspects that might escape the attention of an\nuntutored viewer. It might also provide a basis for making\nthe work meaningful. The viewer thereby gains access to the\nwork\u2019s intricacies and subtleties and the possibility of a rich\naesthetic response. A viewer who is able to experience works\nof art in this manner will likely also have an appreciation for\ntheenterpriseofartasawhole,seeingandrespectingitsvalue\nin human life and culture.\nLet us illustrate with an example. A highly knowledgeable\ncollector recently introduced one of the authors to her col-\nlection of (mostly aboriginal) woven baskets. As she explained\ntheprocessofproducingthebaskets(includingharvestingand\ntreating the materials), the different materials involved,\npointed outthedifferentpatterns, various means ofachieving\nwatertightness,thedifferentstylesofbasketsproducedbydif-\nferent cultures, etc., ourauthor gained an enormous enhance-\nment of his appreciation of basket weaving (contrary to the\nusage with which many of us are familiar of \u201cbasket weaving\u201d\nasatermofderisiontodescribethelearningoftrivial,useless\nandtooeasytolearn skills).Attheendoftheintroduction,he\nhad both a much greater understanding of aspects of basket\nweavingandmuchmorerespectandadmirationfortheprod-\nucts \u2013 he had a much greater appreciation for woven baskets.\nHe was learning not only to detect differences in appearance\n52MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN andfunction,butalsodifferencesinfinesseanddesign.Hewas\ngaining respect for the labour and artistry involved in basket\nproductionandasaresult,hisestimationofthevalueofthese\nbaskets increased.\nAs stated, appreciation has two aspects, highlighted in the\npreceding definition, which are relevant to reason apprecia-\ntion.Onerelatestotherecognitionofthevalue,significanceor\nmagnitudeoftheactivityandcanbecashedoutintermsofthe\nconceptofrespect.Thesecondrelatestotheaestheticqualities\nof the activity, and is grounded in a valuing based on a deeper\nunderstanding of the subtleties of the activity.\n5. APPRECIATING REASON\n5.1. Respect\nPerhaps the most fundamental constituent of reason appre-\nciation is respect. Appreciating reason involves, centrally,\nvaluing its processes and outcomes and honouring its norma-\ntive demands. There are two main kinds of grounds for this\nrespect. One is essentially epistemological, having to do with\nthe role of reason in inquiry and truth-seeking. The other is\nessentially moral, having to do with the connection between\nreason and freedom, autonomy, and respect for persons.\n(There are, however, also ethical dimensions to the epistemo-\nlogical aspect.)\n5.1.1. Epistemological aspect\nOne of the primary reasons that reason is deserving of\nrespectisbecauseitisintrinsicallyconnectedtotheseekingof\ntruth.Reasoningisourprimarymechanismforinquiringinto\nwhattobelieveordoandthusourprimarymeansforarriving\natbetterjustifiedbeliefs.Thus,wewouldexpectsomeonewho\nappreciates reason to have an understanding of the nature of\nthe enterprise of reason-giving and evaluation, and an appro-\npriate respect for its role in inquiry and truth-seeking.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 53 Having an understanding of the nature of the enterprise\nof reasoning involves, to begin with, having a grasp of par-\nticular concepts such as reason, argument, evidence, warrant,\npremise,andconclusion.Suchconceptsarenotisolated,how-\never,butformaninterconnectednetworkwhichisconnected\nin turn with certain principles, and procedures which con-\nstitute the core of reasoning. The concept of conclusion, for\nexample, is conceptually tied to concepts such as reasons and\nevidence, and all these are inextricably connected to that of\njustification. Thus understanding the enterprise of reasoning\nmeans having an understanding of this whole interconnected\nweb of concepts, principles, and procedures which is at the\nheart of reasoning (Bailin 1999).\nWhat gives this whole conceptual network its grounding\nandmeaningisitsgoalorpurpose,andoneofitsprimarypur-\nposes is that of inquiry, which we would define, with Blair,\nas \u201can investigation into whether a questioned or problematic\npoint of view is acceptable\u201d (1987, p.193).3 In the process of\nsuchaninvestigation,knowledgeclaimsareformulated,tested\nand adjusted in order to arrive at the best justified position.\nHavingsomeunderstandingofthenatureofinquiryandthe\nroleofargumentsthereinisasinequanonofappreciatingrea-\nsoning.Thiswouldincludehavingagraspoftheepistemologi-\ncalassumptionswhichareimplicitintheenterpriseofinquiry\nandwhichgivecoherencetotheparticularelements,including\na recognition of the value of reason, a belief in the possibility\nof rational justification in terms of the criteria and standards\ninherent in our critical practices, a belief in the desirability of\nacting on the basis of rationally justified beliefs, and a belief\nthat any of our particular beliefs or criteria could be mis-\ntaken or inappropriate. Without some understanding of this\nlarger epistemological picture in which to ground the partic-\nular practices of reasoning and argumentation, such practices\n3.We subsequently define inquiry as \u201cthe process of carefully examining an issue in order to\ncome to a reasoned judgment\u201d (Bailin and Battersby 2016, p.6).\n54MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN may seem like \u201can arcane game with arbitrary rules\u201d (Bailin\n1999).\nOne way to think about what we are after with our concept\nof reason appreciation might be in terms of MacIntyre\u2019s\nnotionofseeing thepointofapractice (MacIntyre1984). The\nlatter he characterizes thus:\nBy a \u2018practice\u2019 I am going to mean any coherent and complex\nformofsociallyestablished cooperativehumanactivitythrough\nwhich goods internal to that form of activity are realized in the\ncourse of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which\nareappropriateto,andpartiallydefinitiveof,thatformofactiv-\nity (p.87).\nOnthisaccount,reasoningcouldbethoughtofasapractice\nwhich one learns by being inducted into it (Selman 1993).\nOne comes to see the point of the practice, which can only\nbe appreciated from within, through such initiation, and one\nis then (and only then) in a position to appreciate the goods\nor virtues inherent in the practice (MacIntyre 1984). Several\ntheorists,inparticularPaul(1990)andBurbules(1995),infact\ncharacterize the additional dimension of critical thinking in\nterms of intellectual virtues. Such a characterization comes\nconsiderably closer to our conceptualization than does the\ncharacterization in terms of dispositions, as virtues are not\npsychological reifications added on to the skills of reasoning,\nbut are inherent to the practice of inquiry and come out of\nappreciation of the nature of the practice. MacIntyre (1984)\nillustrates this point in terms of a child learning chess who is\ninitially motivated by external rewards:\nBut,sowemayhope,therewillcomeatimewhenthechildwill\nfindinthosegoodsspecifictochess,intheachievementofacer-\ntain highly particular kind of analytical skill, strategic imagina-\ntionandcompetitiveintensity,anewsetofreasons,reasonsnow\nnot just for winning on a particular occasion, but for trying to\nexcel in whatever way the game of chess demands. Now if the\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 55 child cheats, he or she will be defeating not me, but himself or\nherself (p.188).\nThere is, then, a kind of normative force inherent in the\nrules of a practice and entering into a practice entails abiding\nby these rules and respecting their authority (p.190).\nWhile thelearning ofgames isonewayinwhichMacIntyre\nelucidates the notion of practices and the goods inherent\ntherein, the analogy between learning to reason and learning\na game is helpful only to a point. There are significant limita-\ntions to the analogy between appreciating a game and appre-\nciatingreasoning.Whereaslearningmostgamesisanoptional\npastimeandnothingofgreatimportancehingesuponwhether\none learns to appreciate them, the practice of reasoning is not\nreally optional. It is, rather, fundamental to human activities\nand ways of life because it is intrinsically connected to the\nseeking of truth and is constitutive of a number of key truth-\nseeking practices, including moral deliberation, autonomous\ndecision-making, legal practice, and scientific inquiry. In\nvirtue of this, it commands respect and carries with it norma-\ntive force.\nThere are two ways in which the value of reasoning as a\ntruth-seeking enterprise can be construed. The first of these\nis pragmatic. Reasoning has instrumental value in helping us\narrive at the best justified beliefs according to which to lead\nour lives. It can be valued as a tool for getting us to the truth\nor, at least, giving us a reasonable basis for believing we have\nthe truth.\nMoreover, it can be argued, as Clifford did in his famous\narticle,\u201cTheEthicsofBelief,\u201dthatthereisapositiveobligation\nto seek truth through reason. Clifford argued that the accep-\ntanceofunsubstantiatedclaimswaswrongifitmightresultin\na decision that would cause harm, and that this would be the\ncasewhetherornottheharmoccurredbecausetheacceptance\nofunreasonablebeliefwouldinevitablycorrupttheindividual\nor society. Clifford\u2019s argument is a consequentialist argument\n56MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN that demonstrates that, even when truth is valued for instru-\nmental reasons, there is an ethical obligation to hold justified\nbeliefs (Clifford 1999).\nAn instrumental justification, based on consequentialist\nconsiderations, does not, however, provide sufficient grounds\nfor the respect which reason is due. A person who does what\nreason dictates only for pragmatic reasons does not really\nappreciate it in a full sense. Reason must also be valued for its\nown sake, as a good in itself or virtue. As MacIntyre (1984)\nargues,avirtuepursuedforinstrumentalpurposesceasestobe\na virtue.\n\u2026althoughthevirtuesarejustthosequalitieswhichtendto\nleadtotheachievementofacertainclassofgoods,nonetheless\nunlesswepracticethemirrespectiveofwhetherinanypartic-\nular set of contingent circumstances they will produce those\ngoods or not, we cannot possess them at all (p.198).\nAn important dimension of an appropriate stance towards\nreasonwhichisencompassedbytheconceptofappreciationis\nthe affective dimension. Here the analogy to art appreciation\nis again instructive. Appreciating a work of art involves more\nthanhavingapurelycognitiveunderstandingofaspectsofthe\nwork.Italsohasacentralemotionalcomponent.Toappreciate\na work involves responding, at an affective level, to what the\nwork has to offer. The situation is similar with respect to the\nappreciation of reason. Contrary to the popular notion that\nreason and emotion are opposed and in conflict, numerous\ntheorists have pointed out that reason and emotion are inex-\ntricably intertwined. Cognition incorporates many emotional\nelements, and emotions are based in cognitive judgments (De\nSousa1987;Elgin1996;Scheffler1991).Theimageofablood-\nless reason, set in perennial opposition to the passions, is far\nfrom the reality. Scheffler (1991), for example, argues that the\nlife of reason demands certain rational passions, including \u201ca\nlove of truth and a contempt for lying, a concern for accuracy\ninobservationandinference,andacorrespondingrepugnance\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 57 at error in logic or fact. It demands revulsion at distortion,\ndisgust atevasion, admiration oftheoreticalachievement, and\nrespect of the considered arguments of others\u201d (p.4).\nThe person who appreciates reason will have an emotional\nimpetus to act according to its dictates. The impetus to act\naccordingtoreasonisnot,then,tobesoughtinsomeexternal\nmotivation which must be attached to the act of reasoning. It\nis, rather founded in the obligation one feels to do so. Old-\nenquist (1982) eloquently sums up this sense of obligation in\npointing out that rational dialogue with those with whom we\ndisagree opens up \u201cthe possibility of being obligated to lose\u201d\n(p.183).Theappreciatorofreasonappraisesopposingviewsin\na fair and open-minded manner because she understands that\nsuchaweighingiswhatiscalledforbythepracticeofinquiry.\nSheiswillingtobecorrectedbecausesheunderstandsthather\nown view could be mistaken and that fallibilism is a neces-\nsary grounding for the practice. She can appreciate even the\nesoteric pleasure of savoring uncertainty because she knows\nthat one can never be certain that one has knowledge. More-\nover, our feelings about ourselves are tied up with such atti-\ntudes and actions, as Scheffler (1991) points out: \u201cFailing such\ndemands, we incur rational shame; fulfilling them makes for\nrational self-respect\u201d (p.5).\n5.1.2.Freedom, autonomy and discourse\nAswellasbeingthefundamentalwaytoestablishtruth,rea-\nson plays a key role in issues of autonomy, respect for others,\nandconversationaleffectiveness.Havingafullappreciationof\nthe role of reason requires seeing its role in autonomy and\nfreedom. When we use reason to direct our own activity, we\nare acting autonomously. Siegel\u2019s view of critical thinking as\nteaching people to be \u201cappropriately moved by reason\u201d (1988)\nargues, rightly, that it is a good thing to be moved by reason,\nrather than being torqued by manipulative marketing tricks\nor driven by compulsions and irrational fears. It constitutes\n58MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN an act of freedom and an assertion of one\u2019s humanity. From\nour basic understanding of the concept of maturity (which\ninvolves at least being able to generally govern one\u2019s actions\nby rational considerations of future consequences) to the idea\nofinformedconsent,reason,andbeingareasonableperson,is\ncentral to our notion of a fully autonomous and responsible\nhuman being.\nAppreciating reason\u2019s role in autonomy also involves rec-\nognizing reason\u2019sappropriate roleindiscourse \u2013understand-\ning why it deserves respect not only for its utility but also\nfor its place in the fundament of human intercourse. Reason-\ning is a particular way of conducting a conversation. It is the\nleast manipulative and most respectful way to motivate and\nchange belief and behaviour. To give someone reasons rather\nthan threats, to reason with, rather than cajole or manipulate,\nistotreatthepersonasan\u201cend-in-themselves.\u201dWhenwerea-\nson together, we respect the autonomy of the other person.\nStudentswhocometohaveanappreciationofreasoncancon-\nduct less fractious and more profitable discussions by avoid-\ning the insults and manipulation involved in irrational and\nfallacious conversational gambits such as the ad hominem. As\nSocratespointsoutintheRepublic,rationalpersuasionisacru-\ncial replacement for savagery.4\n5.2. Appreciating the aesthetics of reasoning\nThe goods internal toapractice areofmanykinds, and one\nimportant kind is the aesthetic. Truly understanding a prac-\nticeimplies morethanskill atexecuting itsprocedures. Italso\ninvolves, importantly, appreciating its aesthetic dimensions.\nThis appreciation has two aspects: appreciating and valuing\nthepracticeasawholeandappreciatingamovewithinaprac-\ntice.Appreciatingapracticeispartlytheresultofthesophisti-\n4.\u201cSocrates: \u2026 a misologist \u2026 no longer makes any use of persuasion by speech but achieves\nall his ends like a beast by violence and savagery, \u2026\u201d From 412a of the Shorey translation.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 59 cationinvolvedinthemoremicro-appreciationofthespecific\nactivities within a practice. Using our basket weaving anal-\nogy: as our author learned to understand and appreciate spe-\ncific baskets, he was learning to appreciate the whole enter-\nprise.Appreciatingreason,aswithotherhumanpractices,also\ninvolves understanding the subtleties involved in the practice.\nThis means understanding not only the basic rules of infer-\nence, but also what constitutes good argumentative strategies,\ne.g., insightful and imaginative counter-examples. This more\nsubtle understanding of the practice goes beyond knowing\nthe basic rules of inference and premise acceptability in the\nsame way that understanding the quality of a play in a game,\nwhether intellectual or physical (e.g., bridge or golf), goes\nbeyond merely understanding that the play adhered to the\nrules: one can have an adequate knowledge of the rules of\nbridge and be able to play within these rules and still not\nappreciate the strategies of a bridge maven. Ultimately one\nwould want a student to see not only that an argument is\ngoodbecauseitsuppliesplausibleandsufficientreasonsforits\nclaims, but also that an argument is exceptionally well done\nbecause it achieves its end creatively and insightfully.\nAstudentwhocanrecognizegoodargumentativemoveshas\nattained a fairly high level of sophistication and appreciation.\nThisappreciationofthesubtletiesofthepracticecannowalso\nprovide a basis for appreciating the whole enterprise. In the\ncase of reason, the route from appreciating particular argu-\nmentative moves to appreciating the enterprise seems some-\nwhat indirect because a basic appreciation and understanding\nis required (is constitutive) before one can proceed to appre-\nciate more subtle aspects of the practice. This is not unique to\nreason;havingareasonablygoodunderstandingoflanguageis\naprerequisite toappreciating poetry,whileanappreciationof\nthe poetic use of language can enhance one\u2019s appreciation of\nthe beauty and power of language generally.\nIt is important not to confuse issues of rhetoric with issues\n60MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN of argumentative excellence. While what we are calling the\n\u201caesthetics of reason\u201d undoubtedly overlaps with the rhetoric\nof argument, it is not the same thing. Take J.J. Thompson\u2019s\nfamous treatment of the abortion issue: creating an analogy\nbetween becoming pregnant and being captured and attached\nto a famous violinist (Thompson [1996] 1971). The violinist\nbit may well add a nice rhetorical flourish to her argument,\nbut the imaginative use of an anatomically dependent adult to\nrefocus the issue of abortion away from the right to life of the\nchildwastrulyingeniousandanaestheticallypleasingelement\nof her argument.\nTheappreciationofargumentsliketheseinvolvesmorethan\nunderstanding them, more than agreeing that they are per-\nsuasive,andmorethanappreciatingwhateverrhetoricalforce\nis involved. Arguments like these are elegant, often ground\nbreaking moves in a long debate and demonstrate a kind of\nimaginative creativity that someone who appreciates reason\ncan and should enjoy. These arguments are justly revered not\nbecausetheybroughtustothetruth,butbecauseoftheireffec-\ntive use of the argumentative genre to stimulate the imagina-\ntionandbringustopointsofviewthatwedidnotinitiallysee.\nAs argued above, a sophisticated practitioner of a practice\nsuchassomeonewhodeeplyappreciatesart,scienceorbridge\ncan distinguish merely legitimate or appropriate moves in the\npractice from superb and elegant ones. These distinctions\noften require a sophisticated understanding of the enterprise,\nbut such an understanding is the basis of a more or less com-\nplete appreciation of the practice. It is also what motivates\npractitioners as they strive for excellence of practice. As Mac-\nIntyre (1984) points out:\nSomeonewhoachievesexcellenceinapractice,whoplayschess\norfootballwellorwhocarriesthroughanenquiryinphysicsor\nanexperimentalmodeinpaintingwithsuccess,characteristically\nenjoyshisachievementandhisactivityinachieving. \u2026AsAris-\ntotlesays,theenjoymentoftheactivityandtheenjoymentofthe\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 61 achievement are not the ends at which the agent aims, but the\nenjoymentsupervenesuponthesuccessfulactivityinsuchaway\nthattheactivityachievedandtheactivityenjoyedareoneandthe\nsame state (p.197).\nGetting students to experience this unity of appreciation\nand motivation is much of what teaching is all about.\nWe have alluded to the way in which recognizing imagina-\ntive argumentative moves contributes to the appreciation of\nreason, but imagination plays an additional role in reasoning.\nMuch of reasoning is about \u201cwhat if\u201d\u2014about claims that may\nnot be true. The focus of inference in an argument is not on\nthetruthoftheconclusionbutonwhethertheconclusionfol-\nlows from or is well supported by the premises. Notoriously\nmany students have initial difficulty distinguishing between\nthe validity of an argument and the truth of its conclusion.\nBeing able to make the leap to a more abstract view of argu-\nment is an important part of appreciating reason. Arguments,\nespecially but not only deductive ones, have an underlying\nform which is crucial to their epistemological worth. Moving\nfrom the details of a particular argument and in particular\nfrom the truth values of the claims, to reflection on the value\nof the argumentative form itself requires a kind of sophisti-\ncation that is part of appreciating what reason is all about.\nWhileonecanmakeappropriateuseofargumentwithoutthis\nabstract understanding, this lack would mean that one could\nnot fully appreciate particular arguments. Imagine someone\nsaying that Thompson\u2019s argument is poor because medicine\nhasnowayofhookingpeopleupinthewaythatsheimagines.\nThis would constitute a failure to appreciate that particular\nargument resulting from a failure of the imagination.\n6. FOSTERING REASON APPRECIATION\nIt may seem odd that one has to induct students into the\npractice of reasoning which should not, after all, be \u201calien\u201d\nto everyday life in the way in which say, quantum physics or\n62MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN basket weaving may be. Unlike in the case of games, students\nof reasoning are not being initiated into the practice, but are\ninvolved in it from a very early age. Evaluating reasons, justi-\nfying claims, and drawing inferences are all inevitable aspects\nof living (at least in modern societies) and children are intro-\nduced into these practices in so far as they learn to be lan-\nguage-using beings. It can be argued, however, that a large\npercentageofadultsdonotengageinthispracticewithahigh\ndegree of skill (Nisbett 1980). They are already practitioners\nto some degree, but usually not entirely competent ones and\nalmost certainly not as competent as they could be. Even less\ndotheypossessthekindofappreciationwhichisatissuehere.\nFostering such appreciation involves inducting students\ninto the practice as contrasted with merely informing them\nabout it, but this is a complex pedagogical process. This is\nnot the place for a comprehensive review of this challenge.\nWhatwehavetriedtodoistooutlinetherichnessofthegoal.\nNonetheless, we shall conclude by suggesting some general\npedagogical implications of our view.\nThe most fundamental and overarching implication of our\nviewisthatinstructorsofreasoningshouldhavereasonappre-\nciation as an explicit goal of their teaching which suffuses\nall aspects of instruction.

THE APPROACH\n66MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN CHAPTER 5\nINQUIRY: A DIALECTICAL APPROACH TO TEACHING\nCRITICAL THINKING\nSharonBailinand MarkBattersby\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe ultimate goal of this paper is to argue for a particular\napproach to critical thinking pedagogy. Our argument is\naimed particularly at those courses taught at the post-sec-\nondary level which currently tend to focus on analyzing and\nevaluating individual arguments in the name of critical think-\ning instruction.\nWeshallarguethattheunderlyingconcernofcriticalthink-\ningisthemakingofreasonedjudgments.Arrivingatreasoned\njudgments in actual cases is a dialectical process involving the\ncomparativeweighingofavarietyofcontendingpositionsand\narguments. Thus, taking seriously the dialectical dimension\nimplieshavingasacentralfocusforboththeoryandpedagogy\nthe kind of comparative evaluation which we make in actual\ncontexts of disagreement and debate.\nIn order to make this case, we draw upon arguments con-\ncerning the nature of argumentation. Thus a note about how\nwe view the relationship between critical thinking and argu-\nmentation is in order. Although we agree with theorists who\narguethatthetwoarenotsynonymousandthatcriticalthink-\ning may include aspects that do not focus on arguments (e.g.,\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 67 Govier1989),nonetheless,webelievethatargumentationcon-\nstitutes a significant aspect of critical thinking. This is espe-\ncially the case as we view argumentation quite broadly and\nwould argue that much discipline-specific reasoning, includ-\ning inference to the best explanation or the justification of\ninterpretations of an artwork, constitute examples of argu-\nmentation (Bailin and Battersby 2016). Because of the cen-\ntrality of argumentation in critical thinking, we shall draw\nimplications from the dialectical nature of argumentation for\ncritical thinking pedagogy.\n2. ARGUMENTATION AS DIALECTICAL\nOur discussion will take as its point of departure three\npoints made by Ralph Johnson:\n1. The theory of argumentation should develop out of an\nunderstanding of the practice of argumentation.\n2. An important feature of the practice of argumentation is\nthat it is dialectical.\n3. The pedagogy of argumentation should include this\ndialectical dimension.\nWe shall begin by registering our agreement with Johnson\u2019s\nfirst point, that \u201cthe normative dimension of the theory of\nargument \u2026 must develop out of a proper understanding of\nthe practice of argumentation\u201d1 (Johnson 2000, p.6). It was a\nvery similar view, that argumentation theory and pedagogy\nshould be more faithful to how arguments are actually con-\nducted,thatmotivatedtheInformalLogicmovement,anditis\na view with which we concur. We also concur with Johnson\u2019s\nview that the aspect of the practice ofargumentation which is\nmissing from the theory is its dialectical dimension.\n1.\u201cBy \u2018the practice of argumentation,\u2019 I mean to refer to the social and cultural activity of con-\nstructing, presenting, interpreting, analyzing, criticizing and revising arguments\u201d (Johnson\n2007, p.8).\n68MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN It is important to clarify that Johnson uses the term \u201cdialec-\ntical\u201dtorefertoafeatureofthepracticeofargumentationand\nnot to an approach to argumentation theory, as for example\nthe Pragma-Dialectical approach. It is, in Finocchiaro\u2019s terms,\ndialectical as distinguished from monological and not dialec-\ntical as distinguished from rhetorical or logical (Finocchiaro\n2003, p.19). We shall also use \u201cdialectical\u201d to refer to a feature\nof the practice of argumentation.\nWhat might be meant by claiming that argumentation is\ndialectical? In their 1987 paper, \u201cArgument as Dialectical,\u201d\nBlair and Johnson offer the following characterization of the\ndialecticalfeaturesofargumentation,acharacterizationwhich\nseems to have been followed in subsequent work.\n1. An argument as a product can only be understood against\nthe background of the process of argumentation.\n2. The process of argumentation presupposes at least two\nroles: questioner and answerer, although the roles may be\nexchanged at various stages of the process.\n3. Theprocessofargumentationisinitiatedbysomequestion,\ndoubt or challenge to a proposition.\n4. Argumentation is a purposive activity (Blair and Johnson\n1987, pp.45-46).\nThey summarize as follows: \u201cTo say that argumentation is\ndialectical, then, is to identify it as a human practice, an\nexchange between two or more individuals in which the\nprocessofinteractionshapestheproduct\u201d2(BlairandJohnson\n1987, p.46).\nInourview,thesepointscapturesomecentralaspectsofthe\ndialectical dimension of argumentation. To say that argumen-\ntation is dialectical means that it takes place in the context of\nsome controversy or debate. This implies 1) that it is initiated\n2.Johnson continues to make a similar point in more recent work: \u201cAn exchange is dialectical\nwhen, as a result of the intervention of the Other, one\u2019s own logos (discourse, reasoning, or\nthinking) has the potential of being affected in some way\u201d (Johnson 2000, p.161).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 69 bysomequestion,doubt,challenge,and2)thatthereisadiver-\nsity of views on the issue, arguments both for and against (if\nthe controversy is genuine, then it is likely that there will be\nat least some plausible arguments on both sides).3 The dialec-\nticalaspectalsomeansthatthereisaninteractionbetweenthe\narguersandbetweentheargumentsinvolvingcriticism,objec-\ntions, responses, and, frequently, revisions to initial positions.\nOne implication of this view is that we seldom make and\nassess individual arguments in isolation. Rather, we make\nthem in the context of a dialectic, of a historical and ongoing\nprocess of debate and critique, of competing views and the\ngive-and-takeamongthem.Thus,anindividualargumentative\nexchangemustbeviewedinthecontextofthisdialectic(Bailin\n1992, p.64). The following reference by Blair and Johnson to\nAristotelian dialectic captures the essence of this perspective:\nInAristoteliandialectic,aninterlocutor\u2019scontributionhastobe\nseen against the background of the questions already asked and\ntheanswersalreadygiven.Inunderstandingargumentation,this\nfeature points in the direction of background beliefs shared, or\ndebated,bythecommunityofinformedpeopleforwhomthekey\npropositionsoftheargumentarouseinterestandattention(Blair\nand Johnson 1987, p.45).\n3. REASONED JUDGMENT VERSUS RATIONAL\nPERSUASION\nAn implication of the recognition that argumentation is\ndialectical is that, in order to understand the nature of argu-\nmentationanditsevaluation,oneneedstofocusonthewhole\nprocess of argumentation. This involves a focus on the com-\nparative evaluation of competing views rather than simply on\nthe evaluation of particular arguments.\nArgumentation is a purposive activity, as Blair and Johnson\nhave pointed out. We engage in argumentation to some end,\n3.Johnson makes a similar point: typically \u201cthere are good arguments for and good arguments\nagainst a particular proposition or proposal\u201d (Johnson 2003, p.42).\n70MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN but what that end is has been the subject of some debate.\nJohnsonholdsthattherearedifferentgoalsofargumentation:\nrational persuasion, inquiry, decision-making and justifica-\ntion. For him rational persuasion is primary, with other goals\nbeing generated from it. We agree that arguers may have dif-\nferent purposes or intentions in arguing such as the ones he\nlists.Nonetheless,becauseoftherationalanddialecticalchar-\nacter of argumentation, we would argue that the primary goal\nshould be seen as arriving at a reasoned judgment, a process\nwe deem inquiry.4 Whatever the original intentions of the\narguer, because of the normative constraints on arguers to be\nopen-minded, to put their arguments to the test of reason,\nand to be willing to concede to the most defensible position,\nthe normative structure of the practice necessitates inquiry at\nsome level or stage (Bailin 1992). We might think about this\nissue in terms of MacIntyre\u2019s notion of the point of a prac-\ntice, which does not necessarily or always coincide with the\npsychologicalpurposesofparticularpractitioners engaging in\nthe practice (MacIntyre 1984). Yet, through participating in\nthe practice and abiding by its normative constraints, one can\nlearn to appreciate its underlying structure and share in its\nconstitutive purposes.\nInordertoprobethispointfurther,letuslookatwhatJohn-\nson has to say about his rationale for taking rational persua-\nsion as primary:\nI cannot argue it here but I believe this purpose [rational per-\nsuasion] is the fundamental one and others (like justification,\ninquiry, reinforcement) can be generated from it. My strategy\nwould be to mount an argument that parallels Wittgenstein\u2019s\nargument that first we learn to talk to others, then to ourselves.\nWe justify to others, then to self (Johnson 2007, p.3: note 10).\nWe would, however, hesitate to equate justifying to others\n4.By inquiry, we mean critical inquiry, i.e., the process of arriving at a reasoned judgment, and\nnot simply the gathering of information.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 71 with rational persuasion. If you make an argument to some-\none, but the interlocutor presents you with sound criticisms\nand a more cogent alternative argument, then you ought to\nchangeyourmind.Ifoneviewsthepurposeofargumentation\nasrationalpersuasion,andyoufailtopersuade,thentheargu-\nmentation has failed. This seems an unpalatable conclusion.\nIf the outcome of the exchange has been to reach a reasoned\njudgment, then we would want to say that the argumentation\nhas succeeded. It seems to us that the \u201crational\u201d in \u201crational\npersuasion\u201d is central and points to an underlying strata of\ninquiry.\nIt is not our intention to imply that the purposes or inten-\ntions of the arguer are irrelevant to the process of argument.\nThese purposes may frame how we go about the inquiry and\nwhereweputouremphasis.WhenIsitdowntomakemycase\nin an op-ed piece, I am doing something which is different in\ncertain ways than when I am discussing an issue with a col-\nleague.Inthelattercase,Iamtryingtodecidewhattobelieve,\nand in the former I am trying to (rationally) persuade some-\none. The rational persuasion must, however, be preceded by\ninquiryinordertoberational\u2013itinvolves,ineffect,apresen-\ntation of the results of inquiry. And even when presenting my\ncase, I have an obligation to be open to the objections, criti-\ncisms, and argument on the other side that may be offered in\nresponse.ThusIamstill,insomesense,engagedinaninquiry\nprocess. We shall argue in due course that taking reasoned\njudgmentasprimaryisalsobeneficialfromapedagogicalper-\nspective.\n4. REASONED JUDGMENT AND COMPARATIVE\nEVALUATION\nThuswearearguingthatweshouldviewasthecentralgoal\nof argumentation the making of reasoned judgments. This\nprocess of arriving at a reasoned judgment is what we refer\nto as inquiry. By a reasoned judgment we mean not simply a\n72MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN judgmentforwhichonehasreasons,butajudgmentforwhich\none has good reasons, reasons which meet relevant standards.\nHitchcock\u2019s revision of Johnson\u2019s notion of argumentation in\nterms of argumentative discussion has considerable overlap\nwith our notion of inquiry:\nAn argumentative discussion is a sociocultural activity of con-\nstructing,presenting,interpreting,criticizing,andrevisingargu-\nmentsforthepurposeofreachingasharedrationallysupported\nposition on some issue (Hitchcock 2002, p.291).\nAn important difference is that Hitchcock frames his def-\ninition in terms of the purpose of the participants whereas\nwe frame ours in terms of the point of the practice (a move\nwhichHitchcockexplicitlyrejects).Nonetheless, hisnotionof\nthepurposeasreachingasharedrationallysupportedposition\non some issue comes close to our notion of arriving at a rea-\nsoned judgment. In addition, his list of examples of the prac-\ntice of argumentative discussion (p.288) would all qualify as\nwell as examples of the practice of inquiry.\nGiventhatargumentationisdialectical,theprocessofarriv-\ning at a reasoned judgment on an issue necessarily involves\nthecomparativeevaluation ofcontending positions andargu-\nments. Kuhn makes the point thus:\nOnlyifknowledgeisseenastheproductofacontinuingprocess\nofexamination,comparison,evaluation,andjudgmentofdiffer-\nent, sometimes competing, explanations and perspectives does\nargument become the foundation upon which knowledge rests\n(Kuhn 1991, pp.201f., cited in Govier 1999, p.212).\nSuch an evaluation requires knowledge of the details of the\ncurrent debate, or what Johnson refers to as the dialectical\nenvironment. He defines the dialectical environment as \u201cthe\ndialectical material (objections, criticisms, alternative posi-\ntions, etc.) that congregates around an issue\u201d and goes on to\ndescribe what would be involved in mapping the dialectical\nenvironment surrounding an issue:\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 73 Amappingofthedialecticalenvironmentsurroundingthisissue\n[samesexmarriage]wouldrequireustolayoutthevariousposi-\ntions, the objections and criticisms of those positions, the\nresponses to them\u201d (Johnson 2007, p.10).\nItalsorequiresonetoaddressalternativepositions.Johnson\nviews this process of mapping as necessary in order to be in a\nposition to address objections to one\u2019s argument, but we view\nit as much more fundamental. If argumentation is dialectical\nand coming to a reasoned judgment on an issue involves a\ncomparative evaluation of contending positions, then having\nknowledgeofthedialecticiscentraltotheenterpriseofarriv-\ning at a reasoned judgment.5\nAnexampleoftheimportanceofknowledgeofthedialecti-\ncal context can be found in the role of identifying alternative\narguments. A number of authors have adduced evidence\ndemonstrating how significant errors of reasoning can be\nattributedtoalackofunderstandingofotherpositions(Kuhn\n1991) and the failure to pursue alternative lines of reasoning\n(Finocchiaro 1994).\nIn addition to the current debate around an issue, another\naspect of the dialectical context is the history of the debate. If\nan issue is controversial, it is likely that the debate will have\ngone on over a period of time. Knowledge of the history of\ntheargumentationwhichhasledtothecurrentdebate,of\u201cthe\nquestions already asked and the answers already given,\u201d can\nbe helpful and is in some cases essential, to understanding\nthe issue and the various positions which are contesting for\nacceptance. It is, for example, only possible to understand the\nascendancy ofcertainscientific theories byunderstanding the\nnature of the problem which they were addressing and seeing\nwhat other theories they defeated and why. Only in this way\nwe will understand why the dominant theory is seen as the\nbest explanation and what issues still remain contested. Sim-\n5.For a discussion of the difference between alternative positions, objections, criticisms, and\ncounter-arguments, see Govier 1999, pp.223-232.\n74MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ilarly, we can really only understand contemporary political\ndebates by knowing something about the historical situation\nand the historical disagreements in which the contemporary\ndebate has its roots. And knowing the history of a debate is\nimportant in order to determine where the burden of proof\nlies (looking at the history of the capital punishment debate,\nfor example, will reveal that the deterrence argument has\nlargelybeendiscreditedandthat,asaconsequence,anydeter-\nrence-based arguments would now assume the burden of\nproof).\n5. THE ROLE OF ARGUMENT ASSESSMENT\nWehavearguedthatcomingtoreasonedjudgmentinvolves\na comparative evaluation of competing cases. But what is the\nrole of the analysis and evaluation of individual arguments in\nthis enterprise? Certainly, the evaluation of individual argu-\nments has an important role to play as arguments are the\nbuilding blocks of cases or positions. Thus an initial assess-\nmentofindividualargumentsisanecessarypartoftheprocess\nof arriving at a reasoned judgment. It is, however, not suffi-\ncient. A complete assessment usually requires a comparative\nassessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the cases in\nwhich the arguments are embedded.\nWe would, however, also question the extent to which one\ncanactuallyevaluateindividualargumentsapartfromthecon-\ntext in which the arguments are situated.6 One may be able to\nmake an initial, prima facie assessment of whether a particular\nargument is fallacious, but often, in order to know how good\nan argument really is, one has to evaluate it in its dialectical\ncontext.Judginghowstronglyaparticularsetofpremisessup-\nports a conclusion frequentlyrequires more information than\nthatsuppliedintheparticularargument.Onemight,forexam-\nple,constructwhatseemslikeastrongargumentforeuthana-\n6.We discuss the role of other types of contexts (social, political, historical, disciplinary, and\npersonal perspectival) in argument evaluation in Battersby and Bailin 2011.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 75 sia on the basis of individual human rights, but this argument\nmay not be strong enough to prevail against arguments\nregarding the possible abuses of legalization.\nMoreover, this type of comparative contextual evaluation\nwill call on criteria from the particular area as well as tradi-\ntional argument evaluation criteria.7 Thus, for example, eval-\nuating a causal claim in social science may require criteria for\nevaluating statistical arguments; and evaluating a claim about\nthemeritofaparticularpaintingwillcalloncriteriaofartistic\nvalue.\n6. LIMITATIONS OF THE DIALECTICAL TIER\nAsawaytorecognizethedialecticaldimensionofargumen-\ntation, Johnson makes the move of adding a dialectical tier\nto the requirements for an adequate argument. In so doing,\nhe maintains the focus on individual arguments but adds a\nrequirement which enlarges the scope of what constitutes an\nargument. This move to have the dialectical dimension of\nargumentation reflected in the theory of argument is an\nextremely promising and important development. We would\nargue, however, that this approach does not go far enough\nin recognizing the implications of the dialectic dimension of\nargumentation.Takingrationalpersuasionasprimarydictates\na focus on particular arguments and how to improve them in\norder to achieve this goal. Dealing with criticisms, objections,\nand alternative arguments is a way to strengthen (or possibly\namend) one\u2019s original argument(s). We would argue, however,\nthat truly recognizing the dialectical dimension means more\nthansimplydischarging one\u2019sdialectical obligation toaddress\ncriticismsandobjectionstoparticulararguments.Rather,tak-\ning seriously the dialectical dimension means focusing not on\nparticulararguments,butinsteadonthedebateandanevalua-\n7.In their 1987 paper, Blair and Johnson state that \u201csingle arguments are normally parts of a\nlarger process and need to be interpreted and evaluated in that context\u201d (Blair and Johnson\n1987, p.46).\n76MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tionofcompetingcasesinordertomakeareasonedjudgment\non an issue.\nJohnsonhastheinsightthatargumentationisdialecticaland\nthat current theory and pedagogy do not take this into\naccount. His solution is to augment the notion of what con-\nstitutes an argument and build more into the requirements\nfor argument adequacy. Thus a knowledge of the dialectical\nenvironment is necessary in order to anticipate and deal with\ncriticisms, objections etc. and to improve one\u2019s argument. He\ndescribes ways to go about anticipating objections as follows:\nPerhaps even more effective is the step of immersing oneself in\nthe issue and the various positions that have been developed.\nThat means becoming familiar with the dialectical environment\nof the argument \u2026. The better one knows the dialectical envi-\nronment\u2026,themoresuccessfulonecanbeinanticipatingvari-\nousobjections.Becauseonethenknowswhatsortsofobjections\narearound,whatsortsofobjectionsothershaveraised.Onewill\nbe familiar with the alternative positions and possibly be able\nto immerse oneself in them in order to see how someone who\nholds that view might object. One can then make use of one\u2019s\nknowledge of similar argumentative situations to extrapolate to\nthe current one\u2026. Typically some of this thinking occurs in the\nconstructionoftheargument\u2013soitislikelythedialecticalenvi-\nronment will influence the arguer in the very formation of the\nargument (Johnson 2007, p.4).\nThis process of becoming familiar with the dialectical envi-\nronment around an issue (becoming knowledgeable about the\nvariouspositions,objections,andalternativepositions)sounds\nvery similar to how we would describe a major component of\ntheprocessofinquiry.ForJohnson,thisprocessinundertaken\nas a way to anticipate objections and thereby support one\u2019s\nargument. However, if one then evaluates these various posi-\ntions, arguments, objections etc. in a rational and fair-minded\nway, with the intent of identifying the most reasonable posi-\ntion, then one is really engaging in the inquiry process.\nOne criticism which has been leveled against Johnson\u2019s\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 77 inclusion of the requirement of a dialectical tier is that this\nmove would lead to an infinite regress in that supplementary\narguments may themselves require further support, and so on\n(Govier 1999, p.218). We would argue, however, that such a\nresult is only problematic if one tries to build a dialectical tier\ninto the requirements for an individual argument. Otherwise\nit can be seen as a realistic reflection of the dialectical charac-\nter of argumentation, as Govier points out:\nFromapracticalpointofview,thefactthatsupplementaryargu-\nments may be questioned and may themselves require further\nsupport is only realistic, and quite plausible when we reflect on\nthe history ofactual controversies about important matters. Far\nfrom showing that there is a problematic infinite regress in the\naccount,itcouldbeallegedthatthisindefinitenesssimplypoints\ntoafeatureofrealdebate,onethatismirroredintheintellectual\nand dialectical structure of the issues themselves (Govier 1999,\np.236).\n7. IMPLICATIONS FOR PEDAGOGY\nThe third point of Johnson\u2019s which we highlighted at the\nbeginning, and with which we whole-heartedly agree, is that\nthe pedagogy of argumentation should reflect how arguments\nare actually conducted and thus should include the dialectical\ndimension:\nIf my view is correct, then it follows that a critical thinker must\npossess as part of his or her argumentative skills what I called\ndialecticalskills:beingfamiliarwiththestandardobjectionstohis\nposition and responding to them, facing off against alternatives\n(Johnson 2008, p.1).8\nHebelieves,moreover,thatthesedialecticalskillsareabsent\nfrom most texts and tests of critical thinking, which tend to\npresupposeatraditionalaccountofargument.Weconcurwith\n8.The dialectical skills which Johnson outlines include the following: dealing with objections and alter-\nnative positions (including seeking out criticism); knowing what would count against one\u2019s position as\nwell as for it \u2013 knowing weaknesses in one\u2019s own position; changing one\u2019s mind when appropriate;\ntaking time to reflect rather than rushing to judgments (Johnson 2009, p.7).\n78MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN this diagnosis. In order to fill this lacuna, we would argue for\nanapproachtocriticalthinkingpedagogyfocusingoninquiry.\n7. 1. Teaching critical thinking as inquiry\nWhat might such an approach look like and include? 1) It\nwouldhaveasitsgoalthemakingofreasonedjudgments;and\n2)itwouldemphasizethecomparativeevaluationofcontend-\ning positions and arguments in actual contexts of disagree-\nmentanddebate.Thefollowingaretheaspectswhichwehave\nincluded in the inquiry approach which we have developed\n(Bailin and Battersby 2016):\n1. the nature and structure of arguments, the prima facie\nidentification of fallacies, and the use and evaluation of\ncentral argument types such as analogical and causal\nreasoning;\n2. identifying and clarifying issues, as well as determining the\nkinds of claims or judgments that are involved in different\nkinds of inquiry;\n3. understanding the dialectical environment, including the\ncurrent debate and history of the debate;\n4. understanding the various aspects of context which may be\nrelevant, including the social, political, historical,\ndisciplinary, and personal perspectival contexts (Battersby\nand Bailin 2011);\n5. making a reasoned judgment, including the comparative\nweighing of arguments, the evaluation of alternative\npositions, synthesizing the strengths of various views, and\nproportioning judgment to the weight of evidence;\n6. making one\u2019s own case, including constructing arguments,\ncreating analogies, generating alternative explanations, and\nanticipating objections.\nInadditiontoaddressing inquiryingeneral, wealsolookat\ninquiry in specific areas, including the physical sciences, the\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 79 social sciences, the arts, the humanities and interdisciplinary\ncontexts. Considerable emphasis is placed throughout on the\ncultivation of the appropriate habits of mind in inquiry and\ndialogue.\nWe see a number of benefits in this type of approach. First,\nin focusing on argumentation as it is actually conducted, the\napproachshouldfurnishstudentswithsomeoftheknowledge\nand skills necessary for making reasoned judgments in real\ncontexts.\nThere are also dispositional benefits to an inquiry based\napproach. Inquiry is an active process. Students go beyond\nevaluating the arguments that may come their way or be put\nin their path to actively seek information and arguments in\norder to resolve an issue or puzzlement. Habits of mind such\nintellectual curiosity, truth-seeking, self-awareness, and intel-\nlectual perseverance may be fostered in the process.\nAninquiryapproachisalsopreferabletoanapproachbased\nonrationalpersuasionbecauseoftheorientationtoargumen-\ntation which it promotes. One of the challenges in teaching\ncritical thinking is to counter students\u2019 tendencies to \u201cavoid\nchallenge to their own beliefs, to ignore contrary evidence, to\nstraw-personthebeliefsofothers,torefusetoconcedepoints,\nto start with conclusions and then look for arguments to sup-\nport them, to want to win at all costs\u201d (Bailin 1992).

CONDUCTIVE REASONING\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 83 CHAPTER 6\nGUIDELINES FOR REACHING A REASONED JUDGMENT\nMark Battersby and Sharon Bailin\n1. INTRODUCTION\nWhen one begins to survey the work on conductive argu-\nment, two surprising facts emerge. One is that so little has\nbeen written on conductive arguments; the second is that\nmuch of what has been written has focused on establishing\ntheir existence. One would have thought that even a cursory\nobservationofhowargumentsareconductedinallareasoflife\nwould bring to an observer\u2019s attention not only the existence\nofsuchargumentsbuttheirubiquity.Makingjudgmentsbased\non both pro and con considerations is a common phenome-\nnoninnumerousdomains,asGoviernotes:\u201cInmyexperience\nthey [conductive arguments] naturally occur in law, philoso-\nphy, interpretive studies\u2014and in fact in any area, including\nscience,inwhichtherearereasonsforandagainst,or\u2018prosand\ncons\u2019whichwemustconsiderinordertomakeajudgmenton\nan issue\u201d (Govier 1999b, p.160).\nThat the ubiquity and importance of conductive reasoning\nhas not been sufficiently recognized may be a function of its\n\u201cmessiness.\u201dConductiveargumentsdonotfittraditionalargu-\nmentpatterns.Thepremisesneitherentailtheconclusionnor\ndo they support the conclusion in an unambiguous way as\nsome of the \u201cpremises\u201d (or anti-premises, as some have called\n84MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN them) actually adduce reasons that count against the conclu-\nsion. Indeed, Johnson makes the point that conductive argu-\nments are not easily identified as arguments by either Formal\nDeductive Logic or positivism (Johnson 2000a, p.92).\nGiven their lack of conformity to traditional argument pat-\nterns, the appraisal of conductive arguments has become a\ncentral issue. As they are non-conclusive arguments, one can-\nnot specify the criteria for their formal validity, as Wellman\npointsout.Andsincetheyinvolvereasonsagainstaswellasfor\ntheconclusion,theproblemarisesastohowtoweighthevar-\nious considerations and counter considerations, especially as\nsuchaweighingwillbedependentonsubjectmatter(Wellman\n1971, pp.61\u201362; Govier 1985, p.261). For these reasons, some\ntheoristshaveconcludedthat,\u201cItisdifficulttogiveanygeneral\nguidelines about appraising conductive arguments\u201d (Govier,\np.260). Wellman argues, in fact that, although it is meaningful\nto refer to the validity of conductive arguments, the only way\nto establish such validity or lack thereof is by thinking the\nargumentthroughandfeelingitslogicalforce(Wellman1971,\np.79).\nIt is our belief that there are some general guidelines which\ncanbeofferedwithrespecttodoingconductivereasoningwell\nand that these guidelines give rise to a set of criteria for iden-\ntifying inadequate conductive arguments. It is such guidelines\nand criteria that we elucidate in the remainder of the paper.\n2. WHAT DO WE MEAN BY CONDUCTIVE REASONING?\nBefore proceeding with that task, it is necessary to clarify\nhow we are using various terms and to delineate the focus\nand scope of our project. Our focus is not on the structure\nor assessment of particular conductive arguments per se but\nrather on the enterprise of conductive reasoning. By conduc-\ntive reasoning we are referring to the process of comparative\nevaluationofavarietyofcontendingpositionsandarguments\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 85 withthegoalofreachingareasonedjudgmentonanissue.We\nadopt this terminology and focus for a number of reasons.\nThe first is clarity. What are generally referred to as con-\nductive arguments are most likely themselves constructed of\ncompeting arguments which may offer reasons in support of\na particular claim, objections to and critiques of arguments\noffered, or responses to objections. We will call the collection\nof all arguments in a piece of conductive reasoning a case, and\nindividualarguments,simplyarguments.Acase,then,ismade\nup of a collection of arguments whose conclusion is intended\nto support a particular judgment on the issue in question. Let\nus illustrate with an example (taken from our textbook on\ninquiry).Thisdialoguetakesplacefollowinganextensiveeval-\nuationbythetwoprotagonistsofthevariousargumentscom-\nmonly offered for and against capital punishment.\nPhil: You know, Sophia, we\u2019ve looked at a lot of argu-\nmentsandinformationoncapitalpunishment,butIthink\nthat the conclusion is becoming obvious to me. The\nweightofargumentsclearlypointsagainstcapitalpunish-\nment.\nSophia:What made you come to that conclusion?\nPhil: Well, it\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s little evidence to\nsupport the deterrence argument.\nSophia:Agreed.\nPhil: And the incapacitation argument is really\n\u201coverkill\u201d (sorry about that) since the same result can be\nachieved by less drastic means.\nSophia:Agreed again.\nPhil: The issue of cost actually supports the con side\nsince it turns out that capital punishment is much more\nexpensive than life imprisonment.\nSophia:Right again.\nPhil: I think that there is something legitimate to the\nretribution argument in terms of the desire for justice.\nBut retribution can be achieved with life imprisonment.\n86MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN You\u2019ve also convinced me that with capital punishment,\nwe risk an even greater injustice, that of possibly execut-\ning an innocent person.\nSophia:I\u2019m with you.\nPhil:Thenthere\u2019sthefactthatcapitalpunishmentisdis-\ncriminatory.\nSophia:True.\nPhil: And then we\u2019re left with all the moral problems\nof the state killing some of its citizens and, in particular,\nsomeofitscitizenswhoareinnocent.That\u2019saverystrong\nargument against capital punishment.\nSophia:Especially since there are alternatives.\nPhil: And given the worldwide trend toward abolition,\nsupported by important organizations like the United\nNations, the arguments for capital punishment would\nhave to be very strong to counter that.\nSophia:Which they\u2019re not.\nPhil: So, all in all, I have to agree with the abolition-\nists\u2014we should not have the death penalty (Bailin and\nBattersby 2016, pp.235-236).\nThis dialogue may be seen as exemplifying a conductive\nargument in the usual sense, offering as it does a number of\nindependent reasons in support of a conclusion as well as\naddressing objections and counter considerations. As noted\nabove, however, this presentation of the case is preceded by\nconsiderablereasoningintheformofanevaluationofindivid-\nual arguments and a comparative weighing of considerations\nthat leads to the making of this conductive \u201cargument.\u201d Cases\nare often presented in this way\u2014as summaries of conductive\nreasoning, using primary claims to support a judgment with-\nout an explicit statement of the arguments that provide sup-\nport for these claims. But good conductive reasoning involves\nadeeperprocessofinquiryinwhichthecredibilityofprimary\nclaimsisbasedonanassessmentoftheargumentsthatprovide\nsupport for these claims and in which competing considera-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 87 tions are explicitly weighed and balanced. This is the process\nin which Sophia and Phil have been engaged previous to this\ndialogue. It is this entire process of comparative evaluation\nandweighingwhichisthefocusofourinterest,andnotsimply\nthe resulting \u201cargument.\u201d\nConductive arguments, in the usual sense, can vary consid-\nerably in subject matter and complexity. Both the preceding\nargument regarding capital punishment and the argument:\n\u201cI\u2019mtired,butIshouldgotothestoreanywaybecauseweneed\nbread\u201dhavethestructureofaconductiveargument.Ourfocus,\nhowever,isontheformer.Weareinterestedintheproandcon\nreasoning which takes place in complex and controversial sit-\nuations,thekindofcomparativeevaluationwemakeinactual\ncontexts of disagreement and debate.\nAnotherreasonforfocusingonconductivereasoningisour\ncommitment to the view of argumentation as dialectical.\nAccordingtoBlairandJohnson,\u201cTosaythatargumentationis\ndialectical \u2026istoidentify itasahumanpractice, anexchange\nbetween two or more individuals in which the process of\ninteractionshapestheproduct\u201d(BlairandJohnson1987,p.46).\nOurprimaryfocusisonwhatwillmakethisprocessasuccess-\nfulone,therebyleadingtoanadequateproduct,i.e.,acredible\nreasoned judgment.\n3. FEATURES OF CONDUCTIVE REASONING\nTheguidelinesandcriteriaweofferarisefromtheparticular\nfeatures of conductive reasoning.\nThefirstcharacteristicofimporthereisthattheappropriate\ngoalofconductivereasoningisnotthemakingofaconclusive\nargument but rather the making of a reasoned judgment. By a\nreasonedjudgmentwemeannotsimplyajudgmentforwhich\none has reasons, but a judgment for which one has good rea-\nsons, reasons which meet relevant standards. A piece of con-\nductive reasoning can, at best, offer good, but not decisive,\nreasons to support a conclusion over its competitors. Thus\n88MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN arriving at a reasoned judgment will require an examination\nand weighing of the reasons offered on different sides of an\nissue and the balancing of various considerations.\nNo survey of arguments will be exhaustive, however. The\npossibilityalwaysexiststhatadditionalreasonsandarguments\nwillbeputforwardwhichmightaffecttheoutcomeoftherea-\nsoning. Thus the judgment that is the outcome of the con-\nductive reasoning process is always provisional and open to\nfurther examination. In addition, because this type of reason-\ningtakesplaceincomplexcontextswithdimensionsofuncer-\ntainty,theremaybemorethanonejudgmentthatisdefensible\ngiven the context. For these reasons, conductive reasoning\nneedstobeseeninthecontextofanongoingprocessofcritical\ninquiry.\nConductivereasoningtakesplaceinmanydomains(asmen-\ntioned above). It is common in practical reasoning (Hitchcock\n2000, pp.5\u20138) and in social theory and history (Govier 1985,\np.260),butcanalsotakeplaceinvirtuallyanydomain,includ-\ning art interpretation and criticism and scientific inquiry. In\naddition,reasoningaboutmanycontestedissueswillinvolvea\nrange of types of considerations (for example, factual, ethical,\npractical). As a consequence, a variety of different types of\nconsiderations will often need to be taken into account in\nconductive reasoning and the criteria of specific domains of\ninquiry will often play an important role.\nAn important feature of conductive reasoning (of the kind\nwhich is of interest to us) is that it takes place in the context\nof a dialectic, of a historical and ongoing process of debate\nandcritique,ofcompetingviewsandthegive-and-takeamong\nthem. Reasons and arguments have been offered on various\nsides of the issue in question, objections have been raised to\nmany of the arguments, responses have been offered to some\nof the objections, and alternative views have been put forth.\nThis constellation of reasons, arguments, objections and\nresponses constitutes what Johnson calls the dialectical envi-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 89 ronment (Johnson 2007). Having knowledge of the dialectical\nenvironment surrounding an issue is central to the enterprise\nofarrivingatareasonedjudgment(BailinandBattersby2009).\nIn addition, knowledge of the history of the debate can be\nof assistance in determining which arguments are salient and\nshouldbeconsidered,whichareconsideredstrong,andwhich\nare considered defeated and why.\nIn addition to this dialectical context, we have identified\nseveral additional aspects of context that we believe are rel-\nevant to conductive reasoning by playing a role in the deter-\nmination of both the significance and the weight of reasons.\nOne is the state of practice, which refers to the current situ-\nation with respect to the issue at hand (e.g., is there currently\ncapitalpunishmentinthejurisdictionunderdiscussion,andif\nnot, when was itdefeated and why).Knowing wherethe force\nof current practice and opinion lie can help us to understand\nwhatalternativeviewsareupagainstandwhether(andtowhat\nextent) any of these views bears the burden of proof. Knowl-\nedgeabouttheintellectual,social,political,andhistoricalcon-\ntextsthatsurroundanissuecancontributetoourunderstand-\ning of the assumptions that lie behind various positions and\nwhy people might hold them. Hitchcock\u2019s observation that\nstudents\u2019 problems with conductive reasoning are due in part\nto a \u201clack of background knowledge to generate a full enough\nrange and detail of competing considerations\u201d (Hitchcock\n2000,p.7)pointspreciselytothecentralityofthiskindofcon-\ntextual knowledge.\nThe dialectical nature of conductive reasoning implies that\nthe process will be dynamic. Particular arguments are often\nmodified or reframed in response to criticism and objections,\nand these modifications may in turn result in a reframing of\nthe objections, and so on. As Zenker points out, for example,\n\u201cTypically, some premises appear only in response to and\nsometimes integrate an opponent\u2019s objections successfully\u201d\n(Zenker 2007, p.2). In this spirit, Wohlrapp argues against a\n90MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN viewof(non-deductive)argumentationintermsofasequence\nof isolated inference steps and for a view in which \u201cpremises\nandconclusionsofanargumentationforma\u2018retroflexive\u2019sys-\ntem of mutual support\u201d (Wohlrapp 1998, p.342). One impli-\ncation of this dynamism is that weighing arguments cannot\nbe simply a matter of placing competing arguments on a\nmetaphorical balance scale because arguments will often\nchangeintheprocessofreasoning.Conductivereasoningwill\nneedtogiveattentiontothemodification,reframing,andsyn-\nthesizing of arguments.\nBecause conductive reasoning involves the comparative\nweighing of reasons on various sides of an issue and because\nthere will often be good reasons supporting different judg-\nments, how strong the prevailing case is in comparison to the\nothercaseswillvary.Thusthestrengthofthejudgmentswar-\nranted by particular instances of conductive reasoning will\nvary as well. This feature of conductive reasoning points to\ntheneedtoapportion theconfidenceofone\u2019sjudgmenttothe\nstrength of the reasons.\n4. GUIDELINES FOR CONDUCTIVE REASONING\nIn what follows we offer guidelines for conducting conduc-\ntive reasoning, and then use these guidelines to identify vari-\nousfallaciesinconductivereasoningthatonemightseeeither\nintheprocessofreasoning orinacaseinstantiating suchrea-\nsoning.Theseguidelinesarisefromthedialecticalandcontex-\ntual nature of conductive reasoning reviewed above.\n4.1. Appropriately review the \u201cdialectical space,\u201d i.e., identify\nthe relevant arguments and the history of the debate\nAs noted above, in coming to a reasoned judgment, the first\ntask is to conduct an appropriate inquiry into the relevant\narguments, including a review of the history of the debate. In\naddition to providing information regarding the salience and\nstrength of various arguments, the history of the debate pro-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 91 vides a context without which it may be extremely difficult\nto understand some arguments. For example, the problematic\nnature of the debate in British Columbia and then across\nCanadaaboutthewisdomofacarbontaxwaslargelytheresult\nof the fact that most citizens were unaware of the dialectical\ncontext of the debate. For many, it was just another \u201ctax grab\u201d\nby the government with the puzzling and suspicious feature\nthatthemoneywasbeingreturnedtothetaxpayer.Mostsim-\nply did not understand the economic argument about carbon\nbeing an externality (a cost that was not fed through the mar-\nket) that needed to be woven into the price structure of goods\nif there was to be an economically rational revision of the use\nof carbon fuels. The context was not simply global warming,\nbut an extensive debate that had occurred among policy the-\norist about howbest toimplement incentivesforreduction of\ncarbon use.\n4.2. Consider the full variety of objections to the various\narguments and responses to the objections\nThe arguments pro and con about an issue which are the\nsubstance of conductive reasoning need to be identified and\nevaluated along with their associated objections. It is worth\nnoting that there are at least two kinds of objections to indi-\nvidual arguments that provide the support for the primary\nclaims. We suggest using the following terminology. An under\ncutter is a critique of an argument offered in support of a pri-\nmary claim. This critique could attack the premises of the\nargument or the inference to its conclusion. The goal of an\nunder cutter is to show that the conclusion of the argument\nis poorly supported so that the argument\u2019s conclusion cannot\nserveasacredibleprimaryclaiminsupportofthecase\u2019sjudg-\nment.Forexample,anundercutterfortheargumentthatcap-\nital punishment deters would be evidence showing that juris-\ndictions which eliminated capital punishment did not expe-\nrience an increase in murder. Another kind of objection to\n92MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN an argument in a case is a specific counter\u2014a countervailing\nargument or claim meant to provide a countervailing consid-\neration to a particular primary claim. The claim that capital\npunishment will inevitably result in the execution of people\nwho are innocent is directly countered by the argument that\nall socially useful practices have downsides which must be\naccepted;onthisviewtheexecutionofinnocentsisjustsome-\nthingthatsocietyneedstoacceptinordertohaveappropriate\npunishments for first degree murders. These two kinds of\nobjections directed at particular primary claims differ from\ngeneral counter arguments or con arguments. Con arguments\nprovide a different kind of objection. For example, the argu-\nment that capital punishment is a barbaric practice inappro-\npriatetocivilizedcountriesisnotanargumentdirectedatany\nparticularargumentforcapitalpunishment.Rather,itisagen-\neral countervailing consideration orcon argument.\n4.3. Evaluate individual arguments according to relevant\ncriteria\nSince the very concept of conductive reasoning involves\nmarshalling both pro and con arguments and relevant objec-\ntions,oneoftheprimaryrequirementsforreachingareasoned\njudgmentisthatrelevantproandconargumentsmustbeeval-\nuated (just as one would do with any argument). This is not\nan assessment of the \u201cweight\u201d to be given to a certain claim in\nthecase,butratheranassessmentofcredibilityoftheprimary\nclaimgiventhereviewofthesupportiveargumentsandobjec-\ntions. For example, one could evaluate the arguments for the\nclaim that capital punishment does not deter using the usual\ncriteria for causal claims in the social sciences. Alternatively,\none could point out that the appeal to a police chief\u2019s opin-\nion is a fallacious appeal to authority. One could evaluate the\nevidence for the claim that historically, innocent individuals\nhavebeenexecutedandfortheclaimthatitisunlikelythatthis\nproblemcouldbeeliminated(thelatterbyappealingtohistor-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 93 ical evidence, legal scholars, etc.). Finally, one could evaluate\nthemoralargumentthatcapitalpunishmentistheonlyappro-\npriate punishment for certain kinds of murder\u2014this would\nrequire a largely philosophical inquiry.\n4.4. Establish the burden of proof and standard of proof\nrequired\nOne role that the consideration of context plays is to help\nidentify, where appropriate, which side bears the burden of\nproofandtherelevantstandardofproofrequired.Inscientific\ninquiry, the burden of proof bears on any novel theory or on\nclaims counter towell established views. Science is inherently\nconservative in this way. In the political situation, those who\nargue for change in statutes or other political arrangements\ninevitablybeartheburdenofproof.Butthestandardherecan\nclearly and reasonably evolve. After fifty years of widespread\nusage of marijuana and at least some scientific studies, the\nclaimthatitisrelativelyharmless(notharmless,butcompared\nto alcohol\u2026) is widely accepted and therefore claims of rel-\native harmlessness would not bear the same burden of proof\nas they might have in 1960. Even more decisively, the argu-\nment that prohibition would not stop usage seems so obvious\nthat it could almost be assumed in the argument. Returning\nto the capital punishment debate, the claim that capital pun-\nishment is not an effective deterrent against murder is now\nthe accepted view of criminologists and anyone arguing for a\ndeterrence effect would bear the burden of proof.\n4.5. Assess possibilities in light of alternatives\nPart of the assessment of particular arguments should\ninvolve consideration of whether there are better alternatives\nto the position being advocated. For example, with respect to\nthe claims that capital punishment is necessary for both inca-\npacitation and retribution, the existence of the less morally\n94MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN troublingalternativeoflifeimprisonmentprovidesanalterna-\ntive that weakens the force of those claims. In addition, since\nthe goal of conductive reasoning is reasoned judgment, an\ninquirer should not be restricted to only considering alterna-\ntives that have been put forward in the past. Part of the reso-\nlution of a longstanding controversy may well be to consider\ntotallydifferentalternativesratherthantryingtodecidewhich\nof given alternatives is worthy of support. On the question\nof the legalization of marijuana, for example, there is a wide\nrange of alternatives to consider. While California contem-\nplates legalization of marijuana, many other jurisdictions are\nconsideringjustdecriminalizationforpossession,orasinThe\nNetherlands, its sale in only certain \u201ccoffee bistros.\u201d\n4.6. Take into account the relevant range of considerations\nBecausereasoningaboutmanycontestedissueswillinvolve\narangeoftypesofconsiderations(forexample,factual,ethical,\npractical), it is important to ensure that one has taken into\naccount the appropriate range of considerations when\nattempting to make a reasoned judgment. So, for example,\nin examining the issue of whether we should eat meat that\ncomes from factory farms, it would be important to take into\naccount both factual considerations about the conditions of\nanimalskeptonthesefarmsandethicalconsiderationsregard-\ning whether humans have a moral obligation to animals. In\ninquiring into the debate over the raising of the minimum\nwage, it would be important to consider not only statistical\ninformation, but also the differing assumptions about equity\nand merit which are inherent in different positions in the\ndebate.Indealingwithpublicpolicyissues,itwouldbeimpor-\ntanttoconsiderethicalaswellasinstrumentalconsiderations,\nends as well as means, costs as well as benefits, and long term\nas well as short term consequences.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 95 4.7. Take into account and consider a variety of perspectives\nThegoalofreasonedjudgmentinvolvestheattempttomake\nadecisionorassessmentfromanidealobserver\u2019sor\u201cobjective\u201d\npoint of view, striving for the \u201cview from nowhere\u201d as the\nregulative ideal. Striving for this ideal involves attempting to\nlook at an issue from many relevant perspectives\u2014e.g., in a\nmoraldilemmatryingtoseetheperspectiveofboththemoral\nactor and those of the victims or beneficiaries of the action.\nOne might consider, for example, the controversy surround-\ning Peter Singer\u2019s advocacy of the euthanasia of disabled\nbabies.Manydisabledgroupsarguedthathehadfailedtocon-\nsider their perspective (McBryde Johnson 2003).\n4.8.Considerdifferencesinhowissues,arguments,andreasons\nare framed\nOpposingargumentsarefrequentlycharacterizedbydiffer-\nent ways of framing or setting up the issue. Particular ways\nof framing may slant an inquiry in a particular direction and\nreframingmayaffecttheoutcomeofthereasoning.Kahneman\nandTversky(1982)haveshown,forexample,thatthequestion\nof whether a decision is framed in terms of losing lives versus\nsaving lives has significant impact on the way most people\nmake the decision. As another example, a deontological\napproach to moral issues would frame a moral dispute quite\ndifferently than would a consequentialist perspective. The\ndebate over carbon tax provides yet another illustration of\nthesignificance offraming. AfterthepublicoutrageinBritish\nColumbia about the carbon tax, a PR person suggested that\nwhat the government should have done was to reframe the\nissue from a proposal for a tax increase to a proposal for \u201ctax\nshifting,\u201di.e.,shiftingtaxesfromincometaxtocarbonproduc-\ning activities. The carbon tax would not be a tax increase but\na tax shift, which would be more acceptable and intelligible\nto the average citizen, a claim supported by poll results (Bar-\n96MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN rett 2008). Recognizing differences in framing can often help\nonetounderstandtheassumptionsunderlyingopposingargu-\nments and thus to be in a better position to comparatively\nevaluate them. It also opens up the possibility for a mediation\nof frames that may lead to a judgment that incorporates the\nstrong points of the opposing views.\n4.9. Recognize and attempt to incorporate/synthesize strong\npoints from different positions\nGood reasons often do not reside entirely in one or other\nof the conflicting views. Thus it is important, in arriving at\na reasoned judgment, to recognize the valid points in each\nview. The best-justified judgment is often one that incorpo-\nrates the strong points in opposing views.

One key strategy to avoid bias in one\u2019s judg-\nment is to give due attention to evidence and arguments that\ncounter one\u2019s own point of view. As noted above, we have\nbuilt such considerations into the process of inquiry, so there\nis already an important check on confirmation bias, although\nother biases may need to be addressed with different strate-\ngies. An awareness of the historical basis of one\u2019s views and\nthose of others can also help to undermine an inappropriate\nconfidence in one\u2019s views.\n4.12.

WEIGHING AND BALANCING CONSIDERATIONS\nAcentralnotionindiscussionsoftheevaluationofconduc-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 101 tive reasoning, including our own, is that of weighing. What-\never guidelines may be offered, in the final analysis, reasons\npro and con must be weighed in order to reach a reasoned\njudgment. Yet weighing is a metaphor that is difficult to cash\nout in the context of arguments, as numerous theorists have\npointedout.Isitpossibletoquantifytheweightorstrengthof\nvarious reasons or arguments? And if it is not, then does the\nnotionbecomesovagueastobeoflittleuseorsosubjectiveas\nto be devoid of evaluative purchase (Koch 2007c).\nIt is our view that weighing (which we take as the process)\nis a meaningful, if imperfect, metaphor, and that although\nweightings (which we take as the products of weighing) are\nnot quantifiable and will sometimes be the object of disagree-\nment, they are nonetheless not (or not primarily) subjective.\nWeightings can be justified (or criticized) by appeal to objec-\ntive factors and considerations, for example by appeal to cer-\ntainwidelysharedvaluesandprinciples.Moreover,arguments\ncan be evaluated in terms of both the likelihood that they are\ntrueandthesupportorweightthattheygivetothejudgment.\nAnargumentwhich,ifitsconclusioniscredible,givesconsid-\nerable weight to a judgment will add little or no weight if it is\ndoubtful. In the court context, for example, an argument that\nshows that the accused had a good alibi will largely exclude\na conviction, whereas if the alibi is in question, the weight it\nprovidesisgreatlydiminished.Ontheotherhand,thefactthat\nanindividualhasacrediblemotiveaddsrelativelylittleweight\ngiven that many people may have motives for committing a\ncertain crime.\nThe excerpt of the dialogue on capital punishment quoted\nearliercanbeusedtoillustratesomeoftheseaspectsofweigh-\ning. It is important to bear in mind, however, that a consid-\nerable amount of discussion regarding the relative weight of\nvariousargumentshasalreadytakenplacebeforethisdialogue\noccurs(e.g.,Phil:Butyou\u2019veconvincedmethatwithcapitalpunish-\nment, we risk an even greater injustice\u2026) and that this discussion\n102MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN process has been a dynamic one, with some of the arguments\nbeingmodifiedorreframedinthecourseofthereasoningthat\nhas led to the presentation of the case that we see in the dia-\nlogue excerpt.\nWhen reviewing their previous evaluation of individual\narguments, Phil and Sophia agree that two of the pro capital\npunishment arguments, the deterrence and cost arguments,\ndo not hold up\u2014their conclusions are not justified. They are\nrefuted by under cutter arguments and thus are given no\nweight. However, in addition to the likelihood that the con-\nclusion is true or credible, the arguments can also be assessed\nwith respect to the amount of support (positive or negative)\nthey provide for the case for capital punishment. And each\nof the deterrence and cost arguments, if they had been credi-\nble,wouldhaveaddeddifferentamountsofweighttothecase\nfor capital punishment. If capital punishment really did serve\nas a significant deterrent to murder, that would be a strong\nargument in its favor, grounded as it is in the widely shared\nvalue of saving the lives of innocent people. Even if it were\ntrue, however, that the costs are greater to incarcerate for life\nthan to execute, that would not constitute a strong argument\nin light of the moral objections to capital punishment because\noftheprimafaciepresumptionthatmoralissuesshouldgener-\nally trump instrumental issues such as cost.\nAnotheroftheprocapitalpunishmentarguments,theinca-\npacitationargument,isrecognizedassoundinthesensethatit\nistruethatdeadmurdererscannotmurderagain.Nonetheless\nit is seen as a rather drastic way of removing murderers from\ncirculation given there are other possibilities and so is not a\nvery strong argument for capital punishment. Thus this argu-\nment is weakened by a specific counter argument that there\nis a less morally troubling alternative, life imprisonment, that\ncan achieve the same goal. The retribution argument, on the\nother hand, is seen as based on strong grounds\u2014an appeal to\njustice,whichisawidelysharedvalueandonethatisinherent\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 103 to any legal system. Nonetheless, although the legitimacy of\ntheappealtojusticeisrecognized,theweightoftheargument\nasajustificationforcapitalpunishmentislessenedbecauselife\nimprisonment can be seen as an alternative which also meets\nthe demand for justice. For both the incapacitation and retri-\nbution arguments, then, their weight in the debate is reduced\nbecause of the existence of less problematic alternatives.\nThe likelihood of executing innocent people is viewed by\nour two inquirers as a very strong argument against capital\npunishment, indeed as a consideration which overrides most\nother considerations, appealing as it does to a very strongly\nheldvalue(nottokillinnocentpeople)andabasicprincipleof\nthe law (not to punish the innocent). It is true that any system\nof punishment will have errors no matter how good a job the\nsystem does in trying to avoid them. It is, however, crucial to\nthe strength of the argument that some executions (and other\nlong-termincarcerations)havebeenshowntohavebeenerro-\nneous. So the execution of innocent people is not just a theo-\nretical possibility or an exceedingly rare occurrence. The fre-\nquencyofsuchoccurrencesandtheracialbiasevidentinmany\ncases, in at least some locations, add to the strength of the\nargument.Theweightgiventothisargumentmuststillbeseen\nascomparative,however,inthat,ifitcouldbeshownthatcap-\nital punishment were a significant deterrent and that it would\nthereby prevent many more innocents from being murdered\nthan would be victims of system error, a much stronger case\ncould be made for the practice. Because of the comparative\nnatureoftheseevaluations,numbers,ifcredibleandappropri-\nate, may be significant.\nWe can also see how an appeal to the question of burden\nof proof is used to help determine how strong the arguments\non various sides would need to be in order to prevail. In this\ncase,theworldwidetrendtowardabolitionsetsupaburdenof\nproofontheretentionistside.Thedeterminationofburdenof\nproofislesspivotalinthiscaseastheanti-capitalpunishment\n104MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN arguments have been judged to be considerably stronger, but\nit can be decisive with respect to issues where the reasons on\neachsidearejudgedtobemoreevenlybalanced.Considerthe\ncriminaltrialsituationwheretheburdenofproofisclearlyon\ntheprosecution.Thefailureofthedefensetodecisivelyunder-\nminetheprosecutor\u2019sargumentshouldnotresultinthedefen-\ndant being convicted since all the defense needs to do is show\nthat there is a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.\nOne aspect of weighing that is illustrated in the proceeding\nis that an important ground for justifying weightings is an\nappeal to widely shared values and principles. The extent of\nagreementinthisregardshouldnotbeunderestimated.There\nwould, for example, be widespread agreement that the legal\nsystemshouldinstantiateprinciplesofjustice;thatmoralcon-\nsiderations should generally take priority over cost consider-\nations; that the state executing innocent people is extremely\nethically problematic. Some of these values and principles are\nbuilt into various domains and related to the \u201cpoint of the\npractice.\u201dItis,forexample,abasicprincipleinlawnottocon-\nvictorpunishaninnocentperson.Thealleviationofsuffering\nis a foundational value in medicine.

This is\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 105 becauseafreeanddemocraticsocietyattachesgreatimportance\nto the principle that an innocent person must not be convicted\n(p.106).\nHere we have both an explicit statement of a central princi-\nple that ought to be appealed to in legal decisions and a judg-\nment about the appropriate weighting of considerations in a\nparticular case based on this principle.\nThere can, of course, be disagreement, even at times deep\ndisagreement,abouttherelevantorprimaryconsiderations,as\nseems to be the case, for example, in the abortion debate. It is\noften the case, however, that there will be agreement on the\nconsiderations but disagreement over how to prioritize them\norhowtheyplayoutinparticularinstances.Intherapeshield\ndecision cited by Allen, for example, a dissenting opinion by\nanother of the judges argued that the excluded sexual history\nevidence \u201cis either irrelevant or so prejudicial that its mini-\nmal probative value is overwhelmed by its distorting effect\u201d\n(Allen 1993, p.107). In this case there is agreement regarding\nthe principles that are relevant, i.e., prejudicial effect vs. pro-\nbative value, but disagreement about their relative weighting\ninthisparticularcontext.Asanotherexample,amongstpeople\ntoward the left of the political spectrum, there are those who\nsupport a carbon tax because they believe that it would have\na positive impact on the environment while there are others\nwho oppose it because they believe that it would have a neg-\native impact on economically disadvantaged individuals.\nAlthough both groups value both the environment and eco-\nnomic equality, they prioritize these values differently with\nrespect to this particular issue. These differences in judgment\nmay be based to some extent on differences in how the like-\nlihood or the severity of the various possible outcomes is\nassessedorhowtheshorttermversusthelongtermcostsand\nbenefits of the different policies are calculated. But these are\ndifferences for which one can offer justifications and about\nwhich one can reason.\n106MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Another example of an explicit discussion of weighing can\nbe seen in a groundbreaking paper by Cornfield (1959) in the\ncontext of the early debate about whether smoking caused\nlung cancer. Cornfield argued that despite the fact that\nresearchers could not provide a good biological model (i.e.,\nanimalexperiments)todemonstratethelinkbetweensmoking\nandlungcancer,inthiscasethatcriterionshouldnotbegiven\ntheweightitusuallyreceivesinepidemiologicalreasoning.His\nargumentwasthat,sincesmokingexhibitedverystrongcorre-\nlationsandastrong\u201cdoserelationship\u201dwithlungcancer,these\nfacts and the fact of the lack of credible alternative explana-\ntions for the data should be taken as adequate to establish a\ncausal link between smoking and lung cancer. This was one\nof the first successful arguments in epidemiology since the\nlate 19th century to subordinate the biological account to the\nresults of large-scale statistical results.\nWe take these examples to show that there is a role for\na rational examination of weightings and the considerations\nthat lie behind them. In this regard, the two opinions cited in\ntherapeshieldcase(ortheargumentbyCornfield)canbeseen\nas models for the role of the justification of weightings. Such\nan explicit justification of weightings puts them forward for\nscrutiny in the arena of public reason where they can be the\nbasisfordeliberationbyothersandforongoinginquiry.Since\nweighing is a dynamic process, there is always the possibil-\nitythatarguments andevenissues maybe reframed, resulting\nin the dissolution of a disagreement over how values or con-\nsiderations have been weighed. An example would be a pub-\nlic policy debate, initially framed in terms of the competing\nrightsofvariouspartiesbeingreframedintermsofthewelfare\nof the community.

INTRODUCTION\nThis paper begins by making the argument that a degree of\nuncertainty is an unavoidable aspect of conductive argumen-\ntation. The arguments which comprise instances of conduc-\ntiveargumentationvaryintermsofthedegreeofsupportthat\ntheyprovidefortheirconclusions;forthisreason,thestrength\nofthejudgmentswarrantedbyparticularinstancesofconduc-\ntive argumentation will vary as well. We argue, further, that\nthis variability imposes an epistemic requirement on arguers\nto apportion the confidence of their judgment to the strength\nof the reasons. Moreover, because of the dialectical nature of\nargumentation,thereistheadditionalrequirementforarguers\ntocommunicate theappropriate degreeofcertainty oruncer-\ntainty when making judgments in the context of an argumen-\ntative exchange.\n3. ARGUMENTATION AND UNCERTAINTY\nThe traditional focus for the philosophical study of argu-\nmentation has been individual arguments, in terms of both\ntheir structure and their evaluation. The model of argument\nwhichhasbeendominanthasbeendeductiveargument,i.e.,an\nargumentwhosepremisesentailtheconclusion.Providedthat\nthe premises are true, the conclusion follows with certainty.\nUncertaintymay,ofcourse,stillarisewithrespecttothetruth\nof the premises.\nThis requirement of inference certainty does not, however,\nfit a great deal of actual argumentation, as has been pointed\nout by theorists since the inception of the Informal Logic\nmovement.Inprobablereasoning,forexample,theconclusion\ndoesnotfollownecessarilybutonlywithsomedegreeofprob-\nability (Blair and Johnson 1987, p.42). The situation is similar\nforinductivereasoning:\u201cInductiveinferencesvaryfromweak\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 111 to strong; there is no all-or-nothing critique such as \u2018valid-or\ninvalid\u2019 available\u201d (Blair and Johnson 1987, p.42).\nTheoristshave,however,beenincreasinglybroadeningtheir\nfocus from exclusively individual arguments to the entire\nenterprise of argumentation. Argumentation can be concep-\ntualized as a socio-cultural activity (Hitchcock 2002, p.291)\nwhich is dialectical in the sense that it involves an interaction\nbetween the arguers and between the arguments (Blair and\nJohnson1987).Thisfocusismuchbroaderthanthemakingof\nindividualarguments.Rather,argumentsareputforward,crit-\nicisms and objections offered, responses proposed, and, fre-\nquently, revisions made to initial positions (Bailin and Bat-\ntersby 2009). It is this practice of argumentation that is our\nfocus here, and in particular the practice of conductive argu-\nmentation(orconductivereasoning).Byconductivereasoning\nwe are referring to the process of comparative evaluation of a\nvariety of contending positions and arguments with the goal\nof reaching a reasoned judgment on an issue (Battersby and\nBailin 2011). Such judgments are generally based on the\nweighing of both pro and con considerations.\nThefocusofmanytheoristsworkingintheareais,however,\nonindividualconductiveargumentsratherthanonconductive\nreasoning.Conductiveargumentsare,asGovierputsit,\u201cargu-\nments in which premises are put forward as separately and\nnon-conclusively relevant to support a conclusion, against\nwhich negatively relevant considerations may also be\nacknowledged\u201d (Govier 2011, p.262). In our view, however,\nviewing conductive reasoning in terms of individual argu-\nments fails to do justice to the dialectical nature of argumen-\ntation (Battersby and Bailin 2011). In addition, attempting to\nmake conductive reasoning fit into the traditional model of\nargument structure has resulted in unnecessary conundrums,\nfor example how to analyze counter-considerations (are they\npremises? counter-premises?) or how to diagram these anom-\naloustypesofarguments.Ourfocus,incontrast,isonconduc-\n112MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tivereasoningmorebroadly.Accordingtothisperspective,the\nstructureofconductiveargumentationisviewedintermsofa\nbalancingofcompetingargumentsandclaimsratherthanasa\nsingle argument.\n4. UNCERTAINTY IN CONDUCTIVE ARGUMENTATION\nThere are a number of reasons why conductive argumenta-\ntion does not lead to conclusions which can be asserted with\nepistemic certainty. These include inferential uncertainty, the\ninherent uncertainty of particular claims and judgments, the\nopen-endedness of the reason-giving process, and variability\nin the weighing of pro and con considerations. Because of\nthese factors, the degree of certainty with which conclusions\nof conductive argumentation can justifiably be held will vary.\nInferential uncertainty is a feature of conductive reasoning\njust as it is with inductive reasoning. Given that particular\nclaimsaretrue,thereisstillthequestionofhowmuchsupport\nthey give to the conclusion.\nTheuncertaintyhasalsotodowiththeinherentuncertainty\nof particular claims and judgments which go into the rea-\nsoning process. The likelihood of factual claims is an impor-\ntant factor in evaluating their weight as the greater the like-\nlihood of the claim, the more weight it can add to the con-\nclusion. Likelihood is, however, often difficult to determine.\nTo compound the difficulty, any argument leading to a judg-\nment about what to do must also take into account future\nstates of affairs which are usually even less certain than judg-\nmentsaboutcurrentstatesofaffairs.Whatonecandoinboth\nthesecasesistousetheavailableinformation,history,contex-\ntual factors, and statistical tools to make reasoned judgments.\nAnd in the area of moral issues, while there are some widely\naccepted general moral principles, their application in partic-\nular cases inevitably creates some degree of uncertainty, the\ndegreedependingonthestrengthofthesupportingarguments\n(Battersby and Bailin 2011).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 113 The uncertainty arises also from the nature of conductive\nreasoning itself. One important factor is the open-endedness\nof the reason-giving process. Competent conductive reason-\ning requires laying out the dialectic \u2013 the arguments on vari-\nous sides of the debate, as well as objections to the arguments\nand responses to the objections. No survey of arguments will\nbeexhaustive,however.Thepossibilityalwaysexiststhataddi-\ntionalreasonsandargumentswillbeputforwardwhichmight\naffect the outcome of the reasoning (Battersby and Bailin\n2011). This being said, the more extensive the review of the\navailable evidence and argumentation, the stronger the sup-\nport for the resultant judgment.\nUncertaintyalsocomesinduetotheprocessofweighingthe\nvarious reasons pro and con. There is sometimes variability\namongstarguersintheevaluationofthecomparativestrength\nof evidence and arguments on different sides of an issue and\ndisagreement about the appropriate weight to be apportioned\nto various considerations. This is not to say that weightings\nare (primarily) subjective. Weightings can be justified (or crit-\nicized) by appeal to objective factors and considerations (e.g.,\nthe likelihood of claims, appeal to widely shared values and\nprinciples). Nonetheless, there may not be consensus on how\nsome considerations should be weighted and there may be\nmorethanonejudgmentwhichisdefensiblegiventhecontext\n(Battersby and Bailin 2011).\nBecause of the uncertainty of particular claims, the vari-\nability in the evaluation of the comparative strength of evi-\ndence and arguments, the different weightings given to vari-\nousconsiderations,andtheopen-endednessofthereason-giv-\ning process, an instance of conductive reasoning can, at best,\noffergoodreasonsandstrongsupportforaconclusionbutnot\ncertainty.\nThisdoesnotmean,however,thatitisnotpossibletomake\nwarranted judgments in instances of conductive reasoning.\nGuidelines exist for making reasoned judgments and criteria\n114MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN exist for their evaluation (Battersby and Bailin 2011). What it\ndoes mean is that there will always be some uncertainty with\nrespect to the judgments emerging from the process of con-\nductive argumentation and that the strength of the judgments\nwarranted by particular instances of conductive argumenta-\ntion will vary.\n5. CONFIDENCE IN JUDGMENT\nThe strength of the evidence and argumentation in support\nof conclusions in conductive argumentation will vary from\ncasetocase(BattersbyandBailin2011).Insomecases,theevi-\ndence for a particular judgment may be overwhelming. There\nare, for example, very strong reasons to believe that smoking\ncauses cancer or that the enslavement of human beings is\nmorally unjustifiable. In other cases, the weight of reasons\nmay favour a particular judgment but not without significant\nopposingreasonsorcounterconsiderations.Claimsaboutthe\ncauses of the increasing incidence of obesity might fall into\nthis category. In still other cases, the reasons may be insuffi-\ncient for reaching a judgment, for example in debates about\nlife on other planets. Thus, in robust argumentation, warrant\nis usually a matter of degree.\nEngaging in the process of argumentation imposes certain\nepistemic requirements on arguers: that they present argu-\nments justified by the available evidence, address appropriate\nobjections and provide reasonable responses, and revise their\ninitial position when warranted. But the variability in the\ndegree of support for different judgments also imposes an\nadditional requirement on arguers: that they apportion the\nconfidence of their judgment to the strength of the reasons.\nNot all judgments warrant an equal level of confidence. It is\nimportant to be clear that we are not referring to subjective\nconfidence \u2013 how confident an individual may happen to feel\naboutajudgment,butratherrationalorwarrantedconfidence\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 115 \u2013 the level of confidence that is justified by the reasons and\nevidence.\nThefollowingisaschema whichwehavedeveloped torep-\nresent the level of confidence warranted by different weights\nof reasons:\n\u2022 A very confident judgment is warranted when the weight of\nreasons clearly supports the judgment.\n\u2022 A reasonably confident judgment is warranted when the weight\nof reasons strongly supports the judgment but there are still\nstrong countervailing considerations.\n\u2022 A tentative judgment is warranted when the weight of reasons\nisnotoverwhelmingbutissupportiveofoneposition,andwe\ncan make a judgmenton balance.\n\u2022 A suspended judgment is warranted when the reasons for\ndifferent positions are closely balanced or when there is\ninsufficientevidencetomakeajudgment(BailinandBattersby\n2016, p.243).\nThis schema has similarities to the categorization used for\nclassifying the strength of causal inferences in science (US\nDepartment of Health, 2006).\nThese four levels of judgment confidence are not discrete\nbut can be seen as marking positions along a continuum. The\ncategorization allows for a range of possibilities in between.\nApportioningone\u2019sconfidenceinajudgmenttothestrength\nof the reasons is always epistemologically significant. It is\nwhenthereisaneedtoactonthebasisofourjudgments,how-\never, that the issue of how justified our confidence is in our\njudgments becomes crucial. The greater the consequences of\naction (or inaction), the greater the need for a level of argu-\nmentativesupportthatwarrantsaconfidentjudgment.Ause-\nful comparison can be made to legal judgments. In criminal\ncases, where there is a great deal at stake (freedom versus\nimprisonment,orevenlifeversusdeath),thestandardofproof\n116MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN is beyond a reasonable doubt, which requires a level of evi-\ndencesufficienttowarrantaveryconfidentjudgment.Incivil\nmatters, where there is usually less at stake, the standard of\nproofisusuallybalanceofprobabilities,whichclearlyrequires\nonly an on balance judgment.\n6. DEGREES OF CERTAINTY OR UNCERTAINTY\nThefactthatargumentation isdialectical imposes yetafur-\nther requirement on arguers. It is not just a matter of appor-\ntioning one\u2019s confidence in a judgment to the strength of the\nreasons. There is also a requirement to communicate the\nappropriate degree of certainty or uncertainty when making\njudgments in the context of an argumentative exchange.\nThere are many ways in which one\u2019s confidence in a judg-\nment andhence thedegreeofcertainty oruncertainty maybe\nexpressed:\n\u2022 Averyconfidentjudgmentimpliesahighlevelofcertaintyand\nwould be marked linguistically by such phrases as \u201cI am very\nconfident that,\u201d \u201cit is clear that,\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s little doubt that,\u201d \u201cthe\nevidence strongly indicates that.\u201d\n\u2022 A reasonably confident judgment implies a moderately high\nlevel of certainty and might be indicated by such phrases as\n\u201cI am reasonably sure that,\u201d \u201cit seems very likely that,\u201d \u201cthe\nevidence by and large indicates that.\u201d\n\u2022 A tentative judgment implies some degree of uncertainty,\nalthough not enough to preclude making a judgment. A\ntentative judgment may be indicated by such phrases as \u201cit\nappears on balance that,\u201d \u201cthe weight of evidence tips\nsomewhat in favour of,\u201d \u201cmy tentative conclusion is that.\u201d\n\u2022 A suspended judgment implies a high level of uncertainty and\nwould be indicated by such phrases as \u201cthere is not enough\nevidencetomakeajudgment,\u201d\u201cthereasonsonbothsidesseem\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 117 equallybalanced,\u201d\u201cthe judgment will havetobe deferreduntil\nmore evidence is available,\u201d \u201cthe jury\u2019s still out on this.\u201d\n7. AN OBJECTION\nBefore going on to defend our claim regarding the require-\nment to communicate an appropriate degree of certainty, we\nneed, first, to deal with an objection to the underlying claim,\nthat conductive arguments can have a conclusion that\nexpresses uncertainty. In a recent posthumous publication,\nAdler argues against the claim that countervailing considera-\ntionsdetractfromthesupportfortheconclusioninaconduc-\ntive argument:\nTheclaimthatIdisputeisthatoncetheconclusionisdrawn,the\ncounter- considerations continue to diminish its support (Adler\n2013, p.4).\nAs a consequence:\n\u2026theconclusionofaConductiveArgumentischaracteristically\ndetached and accepted without (epistemic) qualification (Adler\n2013, p.6).\nAnd further:\nLetmesummarizemyreasonsfortakingConductiveArgument\nto characteristically lead to unqualified conclusions that are\naccepted and asserted (Adler 2013, p.6).\nIf we understand him correctly, he is arguing that if we are\nasking an interlocutor to accept our conclusion, then we are\nalways asking him to accept the conclusion without the mod-\nifiers of \u201call things considered,\u201d \u201con balance,\u201d \u201cit is very likely\nthat\u201d etc.\nIt is significant that Adler\u2019s objection is framed in terms\nof conductive arguments while we frame the issue in terms\nof conductive argumentation. The difference in framing is\n118MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN important in terms of the consideration of his objection, a\npoint to which we shall return.\nWe would maintain that qualified conclusions are common\ninconductiveargumentation. Inarguments forfactualclaims,\nexpressing uncertainty is not unusual, e.g., \u201cThe forecast\nnotwithstanding, it looks like it might rain.\u201d \u201cEven though he\ndoesn\u2019t like parties, Tom is a good friend so he\u2019ll likely come\nto my birthday party.\u201d \u201cThere are many fine contemporary\nauthors, but she is probably the best of her generation.\u201d The\ncommunication of the degree of certainty of findings is also a\ncommon practice in the kind of argument to the best expla-\nnation exhibited in scientific reasoning and scientific reports.\nThefollowingexcerptfromanIPCCassessmentreportoncli-\nmate change explains the confidence levels used in the report:\nThe degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is\nbased on the author teams\u2019 evaluations of underlying scientific\nunderstanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confi-\ndence(fromverylowtoveryhigh)and,whenpossible,probabilis-\nticallywithaquantifiedlikelihood(fromexceptionally unlikely to\nvirtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based\non the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g.,\ndata, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judg-\nment) and the degree of agreement. SPM-2\nThefollowingexamplesfromthereportillustratetheuseof\nthese confidence levels:\n1. It is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has\nwarmed since the mid-20th century. More complete\nobservations allow greater confidence in estimates of\ntropospheric temperature changes in the extratropical\nNorthern Hemisphere than elsewhere.

It is likely that anthropogenic influences have affected the\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 119 global water cycle since 1960. Anthropogenic influences\nhave contributed to observed increases in atmospheric\nmoisture content in the atmosphere (medium confidence), to\nglobal-scale changes in precipitation patterns over land\n(medium confidence), to intensification of heavy precipitation\nover land regions where data are sufficient (medium\nconfidence),andtochangesinsurfaceandsub-surfaceocean\nsalinity (very likely). {2.5, 2.6, 3.3, 7.6, 10.3, 10.4} SPM-13\nAlthough Adler\u2019s argument seems to be directed toward\nconductive arguments in general (\u201cthe conclusion of a Con-\nductiveArgumentischaracteristicallydetached\u2026\u201d),manyofhis\nexamples involve practical reasoning, where the conclusion is\na decision or recommendation about whether to act. Appar-\nently, he would reject a conclusion that \u201cwe should probably\ndo X.\u201d Yet, in practice, we do often qualify a recommendation\nby\u201cweshouldprobably,\u201d\u201conbalancethebestthingtodoseems\nto be,\u201d \u201cthere are good reasons to\u201d etc.\nGiven the frequency of qualified conclusions in conductive\nargumentation,onemightwonderwhatAdler\u2019sreasonsarefor\ndenying their possibility. The basis of his argument is a logi-\ncalone\u2013thatinorderforaconductiveargumenttobecogent,\ni.e.,inorderforitsconclusiontobecorrectlyacceptedastrue,\nthe conclusion must stand on its own.1 His focus is on cogent\narguments, that is, arguments that end inquiry. The alterna-\ntiveforAdlerisnotqualifiedconclusionsbutrathersuspended\njudgment.\nIt is here that the problem of viewing conductive argumen-\ntation in terms of individual arguments becomes manifest.\nAdler\u2019s analysis has some plausibility when applied to exam-\nples such as the classic argument offered by Wellman:\n1.Surprisingly given his thesis, Adler does acknowledge that \u201cthere are loads of arguments\nthat end with qualified conclusions, including, \u2018plausible\u2019 or, more equivocally, \u2018the best\nexplanation is\u2019\u201d (p. 7). But the rest of his argumentation leads us to believe that he would\nreconcile this apparent contradiction by asserting that such arguments are not cogent, i.e.,\nthey are not arguments which can be put forward for acceptance.\n120MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Although your lawn needs cutting, you ought to take your\nson to the movies because the picture is ideal for children\nand will be gone by tomorrow (Wellman 1971, p.67). Most of\ntheexamplesofferedbyAdler,however,(e.g.,mandatedhealth\ncare insurance, stricter rules to restrict immigration, build-\ning nuclear powerplants)areinstances ofcomplex, dialectical\nargumentation. (Indeed, the distinction between conductive\narguments and conductive argumentation is one that Adler\nhimselfappears,inplaces,toacknowledge:Adler,p.2,footnote\n1). In such cases, it is inappropriate to expect certainty (for all\nthe reasons outlined above). It is inappropriate to expect con-\nclusionsthatare\u201ctrue\u201d.Whatwecanexpect,instead,arejudg-\nments that have varying degrees of support.\nAdler\u2019s argument does have some prima facie plausibility in\nthat for practical arguments, either we should act, we should\nnot act, or we simply do not know what to do. Indeed, it\ndoes seem that when we decide to do something, we have\n\u201cdetached\u201d the decision from the reasoning through our com-\nmitmenttoaction.Butthedetachmentisineffectapragmatic\ndetachment which does not necessarily indicate unqualified\nconfidence, nor will it necessarily end inquiry.

With more complex issues, how-\never, even once an action has been taken, inquiry does not\nnecessarily end, e.g., the U.S. government has made a decision\nwithrespecttomandatedhealthcareinsurance,butthedebate\nhas certainly not ended.\nIt seems to be Adler\u2019s view that it is only detached, unqual-\nified conclusions that \u201cdiscern or advance and settle new or\ninteresting or important truths, that are worth believing for\nourselves or for our audience. They increase our information\nandexpandourcorpusofbeliefs\u201d(Adler2013,p.6).Wewould\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 121 argue, on the contrary, that it is appropriately qualified con-\nclusionsthatreallyaddtoourjustifiedbeliefs.Wearejustified\nin holding our beliefs on such issues with varying degree of\nconfidence commensurate with the strength of the support.\nJane\u2019sbeliefthatthereshouldbegovernmentmandatedhealth\ncare insurance is one she may hold with considerable con-\nfidence given the strength of the reasons in favor and the\nweakness of the reasons against.

The\nconclusionsofconductiveargumentationarejudgmentsandit\nisarequirementofreasonablenessthatsuchjudgmentsshould\nreflect the degree of support provided by our reasons.\n8. COMMUNICATING CONFIDENCE AND CERTAINTY\nWe have been arguing, then, that there is a requirement to\napportion one\u2019s confidence in a judgment to the strength of\nthe reasons in support of the judgment. We would argue, fur-\nther, there is also an epistemic and moral responsibility to\ncommunicate the appropriate degree of certainty or uncer-\ntainty when making judgments in the context of an argumen-\ntative exchange. This responsibility arises from the dialectical\nand interactive nature of conductive argumentation. Accord-\ning to Johnson, that an exchange is dialectical means that \u201cas\naresultoftheintervention oftheOther,one\u2019sownlogos (dis-\ncourse, reasoning, or thinking) has the potential of being\naffected in some way\u201d (Johnson 2000, p.161). In other words,\nthe reasoning and judgments made by others can and often\nshould affect my reasoning and judgments and form part of\nthe basis for my actions. Just as offering well justified judg-\n122MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ments in the context of an argumentative exchange can con-\ntributetoothersholdingbetterjustified beliefs andundertak-\ning better justified actions, so also can communicating one\u2019s\njudgments at the appropriate level of confidence. Acknowl-\nedging uncertainty orconfidence aspartofone\u2019sjudgment or\ndecisiontoactcaninformothersofhowmuchconfidenceyou\nor they should have in the judgment. Communicating a judg-\nmentataninappropriatelevelofconfidence,forexamplewith\nmore confidence than is warranted by the evidence, may con-\ntributetootherinterlocutorsholdingbeliefsoractinginways\nthat are poorly grounded.\nThis responsibility is especially significant when one is in\na position of epistemic authority. Experts have an obligation\nto provide reasons for their judgments, however in contexts\nrequiring expertise, recipients of the judgment are often not\nin a position to assess the reasoning in any detail. These judg-\nments are generally accepted largely on the basis of trust in\nthe expertise and reliability of the authority. Thus the level of\nconfidence that is expressed in the judgment is an important\naspect of the information communicated in the judgment.\nReturning to the IPCC report, it would have been misleading\nifthereporthadomittedtheconfidencelevelsintheirvarious\nfinding. This is especially important as such judgments often\nform the basis for decisions regarding action, or may them-\nselvesberecommendationsforaction.Comparethefollowing\njudgmentsbyaphysician:(1.)\u201cIhavecarefullyevaluatedallthe\nevidence and would not recommend surgery.

Given that the purpose of conductive argu-\nmentationistoconsidercountervailingconsiderationsandyet\ncome to a reasonable conclusion, failure to communicate the\ndegreeofjustificationorcertaintythattheargumentsprovide\nalso violates basic norms of communication.\n9. THE L\u2019AQUILA CASE\nThetrialoftheItalianscientists andofficials intheL\u2019Aquila\nearthquake case is a pertinent one to examine with respect to\nthe issue of the communication of certainty or uncertainty.\nThe earthquake had been preceded by a swarm of small\nquakes,andthechargeagainstthedefendantswasthattheydid\nnot do their duty in communicating the likelihood of a major\nearthquake to the citizens of L\u2019Aquila.\nOne of the scientists tried, Enzo Boschi, the then-president\nof Italy\u2019s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, is\nsaidtohavecomparedthesituationtoalargequakethatstruck\nL\u2019Aquila in 1703. Boschi is alleged to have said at a meeting\nin L\u2019Aquila on March 31, 2009, \u201cIt is unlikely that an earth-\nquake like the one in 1703 could occur in the short term, but\nthe possibility cannot be totally excluded.\u201d In a press confer-\nence after the meeting, Department of Civil Protection offi-\ncialBernardoDeBernardinis,alsoadefendant,isquoted(and\nonvideorecord)assayingthatthesituationwasnormalgiven\nthe context, posing \u201cno danger,\u201d and urging residents to relax\n(Pappas 2012).\nThe details of the case are complex and include allegations\nofpoliticalpressure,andofmisrepresentationofmaterial.We\nhavenointention totrytoevaluatethemerits ofthecase, nor\nare we in a position to do so. Nonetheless some of the issues\nraised are pertinent to our discussion. The statements of both\nBoschi and De Bernardinis would have been grounded in the\n124MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN knowledge that earthquake swarms are very common in seis-\nmically active regions such as Abruzzo but only a very small\npercentage are precursors to major quakes. In fact, seismolo-\ngistsclaimthatitisvirtuallyimpossibletopredictmajorearth-\nquakes. Yet we can note a difference in the level of certainty\ncommunicatedinthetwojudgments.Boschi\u2019sjudgmentthata\nmajorearthquakewasunlikelycouldbecharacterizedasarea-\nsonably confident judgment, but in alluding to the possibility\nof such a quake, it communicated a degree of uncertainty in\nthe judgment. De Bernardinis, in contrast, seemed to be mak-\ning a very confident judgment that there was no danger of a\nmajorquake.Hisjudgmentmadenoreferencetothepossibil-\nity, slight though it may have been. The risk was indeed very\nlow, but not non-existent. Thus his pronouncement, commu-\nnicated tothepublic, thattherewas\u201cnodanger\u201d wasepistem-\nically overly confident, expressing an unreasonable degree of\ncertainty.\nThe scientists and officials in question were considered\nepistemic authorities andthelevelofcertaintycommunicated\nbythemtomembersofthepublicappearstohaveaffectedthe\npublic\u2019s actions. A local investigator, Inspector Lorenzo Cav-\nallo, is quoted as saying: \u201cThe Commission calmed the local\npopulation down following a number of earth tremors. After\nthe quake, we heard people\u2019s accounts and they told us they\nchanged their behaviour following the advice of the commis-\nsion\u201d (Watt, S. 2011). This account is corroborated repeatedly\nby witnesses testifying at the trial (Billi 2013).\nThe specifics of this particular case are complex and con-\ntested, and it would be inappropriate and imprudent to\nattempt to pass any judgments. One thing that we do think\nthatthecasedemonstrates,however,isastrongrecognitionof\ntheresponsibilitytocommunicatetheepistemicallyappropri-\nate degree of certainty or uncertainty in our judgments.

ASPECTS OF THE APPROACH\n128MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN CHAPTER 8\nASSESSING EXPERT CLAIMS: CRITICAL THINKING AND\nTHE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY\nMark Battersby\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMuch of our understanding and knowledge of the world is\nbased on the authoritative pronouncements of experts. Both\nour scientific and historical understandings are grounded in\nthisway.Thinkofthegermtheory,astronomy,platetectonics,\nancient history, dinosaurs, the origin of humans; it does not\ntake much reflection to see that most of our understanding of\nthe world is, in fact, grounded on information supplied and\nwarranted byexperts. Givenhowmuchofourknowledge has\nthis basis, one would think that epistemologists would have\ngivendetailedconsiderationtotheissueofappealtoscientific\nand other intellectual authority. But appeals to authority and\nthe role that authority plays in knowledge have received little\nattention in modern philosophy. Indeed, philosophers gener-\nally have been opposed to such appeals since the very birth of\nWestern philosophy.\nGreek philosophy distinguished itself from Greek theology\nbyrejectingappealstoauthority(thewisdomoftheancientsor\nthe oracle\u2019s supply of the word of god) as the primary basis of\nknowledge and replacing these appeals with appeals to obser-\nvation and reason as the basis of knowledge. Philosophy in\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 129 many ways began with rejection of authoritative pronounce-\nments, and when philosophy revived in the 17th century, the\naversion to authority reappeared. By rejecting the authority\nof both the church and Aristotle, Descartes, Bacon, and Locke\nhelped pave the way for modern science. These authors all\nrejected the appeal to any authority and, in doing so, marked\nthe beginning of modern philosophy with its emphasis on\nindividual confirmation of claims.\nAsaresultofthishistory,mostcontemporaryintroductions\nto epistemology do not even mention the issue of appeals to\nexpertsandauthority,andthereislittleincontemporaryepis-\ntemological literature that concerns itself with this topic.1 But\none might expect that critical thinking, with its concern with\nthe practical needs of knowledge assessment, would devote\nconsiderably more attention to appeals to authority. In fact,\nmost critical thinking texts do not even refer to appeals to\nauthorityandonlyafewtextsgivethesubjectsignificanttreat-\nment. Of those that do treat such appeals, many give appeals\na definite secondary and necessary evil status. For example,\nWalton states:\ngenerally speaking we only appeal to experts, if in fact, it may\nbetooexpensiveorotherwisedifficultforustohavedirectevi-\ndence.Thatiswhywemaylegitimatelyappealtoexpertsasasec-\nondarysourceofsubjectiveknowledgewhenwehavetomakea\ndecision (Walton 1987, p.187).2\nThere are at least two reasons for such neglect. One is the\nphilosophical tradition mentioned above, but perhaps the\nmostimportantreasonisthatappealstoauthorityseemtovio-\nlate the spirit of critical thinking. After all, was not critical\n1.The articles by Walsh (1971), Stitch and Nisbett (1980), Hardwig (1985), and Lehrer (1977),\nand to some extent the book by Welbourne (1986) are the only ones that I have been able to\nfind. Some of the work in philosophy of science outlining the social nature of justification is\nrelated.

CRITIQUE OF THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH\nThe typical analysis of arguments involving appeals to\nauthority is as follows:\nA has asserted P.\nP falls within area of knowledge K.\n132MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN A is a recognized expert regarding K.\nTherefore, P is acceptable (Govier 1988, p.83).\nSomeauthors,includingGovier,andBlairandJohnson,also\npoint out that additional considerations surrounding such an\nappeal include:\nThe expert must not be in a position of bias.\nThe experts on K agree about P.\nThe more eminent the expert, the stronger the\nappeal.\n3. DIFFICULTIES WITH THIS APPROACH\nBefore exploring the difficulties with this approach, I must\nmake a rough and, I hope, uncontroversial distinction\nbetweenparticularandgeneraljudgments.Bythisdistinction\nI have in mind the difference exemplified by an engineer, on\nonehand,givingherviewastowhyabridgecollapsed(apar-\nticular judgment),and, ontheother,offering thephysical and\nengineering theory of stress (general judgment). The reason\nfor this distinction is that an expert\u2019s expertise is utilized in\ndifferent ways in the two kinds of judgments.\nIn the typical complex particular judgment, the expert is\ncalled upon to use her explicit and implicit understanding of\nthe issue. In a particular judgment, there is more reliance on\nthe expert\u2019s individual expertise, experience, and even emi-\nnence in her field. In contrast, in the general judgment we are\nrelying on the expert\u2019s knowledge of views held in her field;\nher responsibility in enunciating this knowledge is to convey\nthe wisdom of the discipline, not her personal views. In the\ncaseofageneraljudgment,theexpertisprimarilyavehiclefor\ntransmitting the views developed and confirmed in her dis-\ncipline. Significantly, this is characteristic of the situation we\nfindourselvesinasteachers:weessentiallyconveyknowledge\nof our discipline.\nIf, indeed, the expert functions differently in the two kinds\nof judgments, then any adequate model of appeal to authority\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 133 must recognize this distinction. But no model I have found\ndoes so. Those models which emphasize the eminence of the\nauthorityaspartofthecriteriaofassessmentseemtobebased\non the particular judgment model. Those that only mention\nthe importance of consensus of the expert\u2019s discipline seem\nconcerned only with the general claim.\nIn critical thinking, we are mainly concerned with the\nexpert as a source of general claims \u2013 regarding, for example,\nthe nature of the solar system, the causes of cancer. For this\nreason we are predominantly concerned with the expert as\nrepresentative of her discipline rather than as someone using\nher expertise to make a particular judgment. In this paper, I\nwill only discuss appeals to authority in relation to general\nclaims.Thereremainsmuchtobesaidaboutparticularclaims,\nespecially in value-oriented disciplines and everyday deci-\nsions.\nWhat then are the implications of observing that the expert\nis primarily a vehicle for transmitting knowledge of her dis-\ncipline rather than an individual source of knowledge? First,\nwemustabandonthemodeloftheexpertassomeonewhocan\ngive us knowledge simply by telling us her view. We listen to\nexperts because they are representatives of a body of knowl-\nedge. That is why there should not be expert disagreement in\nthe fields to which we are appealing: we are not really inter-\nested in the expert\u2019s personal opinion, but rather that of her\ndiscipline. If there is no consensus in the discipline, then the\ndiscipline has, in a sense, nothing (univocally) to say. Only\nby viewing the expert as a discipline spokesperson can we\nunderstandtherequirementsofappealstoauthority,dealwith\nLocke\u2019sobjection,andevenmakesenseofourroleasteachers\nof critical thinking.\n4. EXPERT DISAGREEMENT\nOnethingshouldalertustotheweaknessofthetraditional\nanalysis. In this approach, disagreement among experts ren-\n134MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ders appeals to authority fallacious. But many of the inter-\nesting cases with which one has to deal will involve conflict\namongexperts.Whataboutconflictingopinionsfromdoctors,\ndisagreement among experts about the proper treatment of\nAIDS, or the causes of cancer? The courts must deal with\nexpert conflict as a matter of course. Are all such conflicts to\nbe deemed sufficient ground for dismissing the expert opin-\nions presented? This seems much too drastic to be sensible.5\n5. LEGAL APPROACHES TO THE USE OF EXPERTS6\nRather than dismiss competing expert claims, the courts\ninsist that the expert not just deliver her opinion but also\nexplaining her reasoning. Given the model I am criticizing,\nthis requirement would seem surprising. Should one not just\naccept the claim if the expert has the relevant credentials? But\nthe courts are faced with conflicts among experts and feel too\naccountable to simply bow to the authority of the expert.\nLocke\u2019s objection would be taken quite seriously by the\ncourts. They cannot be utilizing mere \u201copiniatrety\u201d because\nthey are responsible for legal decisions. The courts\u2019 compro-\nmise is to take expert opinion, but require that the expert\nexplainherselfsothatthecourtcanbothjudge(wherethereis\nconflict, or just doubt) and understand.\nBecausecourtshavetodealwithconflictingtestimony,they\nhave to make a judgment on the merits of the expert\u2019s argu-\nment. They assess the clarity, methods, apparent bias, and\nplausibility of competing experts\u2019 explanations in order to\ndecide how to weigh the opinions. Experts in the courtroom\nare an exception to the general rule that the courts engage in\n5.There has been an effort to deal with expert conflict by Walton (1987) based on the work on\nplausible reasoning of Rescher. This approach is fairly technical and has not seen imple-\nmentation in any textbooks. But it, also, is based on the notion of total evidence, although it\nuses a method for choosing the maximum consistent subset of information. Necessarily this\njust eliminates one expert\u2019s opinion when there is genuine contradiction.\n6. I owe most of my understanding of the court\u2019s use of scientific information\nto Imwinkelried (1987).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 135 reasoning and the witnesses are merely to report what they\nsaw,heard,etc.Butbecausetheexperts\u2019opinionsarebasedon\nreasoningfromthefactsandnotmerelyonassertingthem,the\ncourtsreservetherighttoexaminethisreasoning.Insodoing,\ntheyarenotrestrictedtoconsideringonlycharacterquestions\nwhen evaluating testimony and argument but rather use all\nevidence to determine the weight to be given to the experts\u2019\nclaims. It seems to me that this approach is exactly the right\nstrategy for any rational person to take.7\nThe procedures of the court should show us that the sharp\ndistinction made between testimony and argument is unten-\nable. We need the expert\u2019s credibility before we will believe\nher arguments, but her credibility is not the sole basis of our\nappraisal. Argument assessment is to some extent discipline-\nspecific and, for this reason, we need the assurance of the\nexpertthatthislineofreasoningandthesetypesofinferences,\nare respected within her field. We need her reassurance that\nshe is not ignoring counter-evidence or contrary opinions\nwithin her field. We also must, of course, comprehend and be\npersuaded by the evidence and explanations. But even allow-\ning our understanding to be moved by the expert\u2019s account is\nitself an act of trust in her authority.\nThe crucial point for critical thinking is that appeals to\nauthority must involve justification and explanation. What the\nLockean model (and the contemporary one given above)\nignores is the expert\u2019s obligation to supply justification for\nher position. The model cannot tolerate disagreement among\nexperts because it provides virtually no method of adjudica-\ntion. This point is the most crucial objection and, indeed, is\n7.John Hardwig suggests that the layperson, when confronted with expert disagreement, will\nhave to base her decision primarily on ad hominem kinds of considerations because of her\ninability to assess justifications. There is no question that the assessment of the expert her-\nself (but also the credibility of the discipline - ad disciplinium?) is something a layperson\nshould do. Like a judge, the layperson is also wise to attempt to assess the conflicting justifi-\ncations using whatever evidence she can gather. This is simply an application of the princi-\nple of total evidence.\n136MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN the basis of Locke\u2019s criticism: the model seems to require just\ntoo much mindless trust in the experts. By not requiring that\nthe expert provide any argument, explanation or justification\nfor her assertion, the model leaves the believer in a hopeless\nstate of acute epistemic dependence.8 It probably also leaves\nthe layperson who accepts the claim with no real understand-\ning of the claim she now believes.\n6. APPEAL TO AUTHORITY AND EDUCATION\nTotheextent thateducation consists simplyintelling with-\nout justification and explanation, it, too, leaves the student in\nastateofepistemicdependence(tosaynothingofignorance!).\nBut without trust in authority, there would be no successful\ntransmissionofknowledge.Forexample,inpartwebelievein\nthe biological theory of germs because it is explained to us in\namannerthatmakessense.Butwealsobelieveinitbecauseit\nis supplied and backed by a well-established discipline.

This opens the door\nto utilizing (with appropriate skepticism) expertise in value-\nladen fields.\n7. APPEAL TO AUTHORITY IN VALUE-LADEN FIELDS\nMostauthorsexcludeappealtoauthorityinvalue-ladendis-\nciplines. But what about great moralists, literary critics, aes-\ntheticians? Is there no place for appeal to authority in these\ncases? Perhaps theappeals areweaker,butaretheyfallacious?\nAre these all to be ignored? Lacking a theory to justify the\nrejectionofsuchappealstoauthority,itishardtoseewhatthe\nbasis is for rejection of appeals to authority in art criticism,\nphilosophy, etc. There certainly is expertise among literary\nand art critics, architects, and town planners, though these\nfieldsarerifewithappealstovalue.Letmesuggestbrieflythat\nany discipline qua discipline must have standards which are\nmore or less consensually shared. Otherwise there would be\nno discipline, no way to justify awarding degrees, grades, and\nsuch. To the extent that there is some underlying consensus,\na powerful case can be made for legitimate appeals to at least\nconsensually held views. Again, this all requires much devel-\nopment.\n8. EMINENCE\nMy last criticism of the standard model concerns the claim\nthat the more eminent the expert, the more successful the\nappeal. In most general cases, someone with adequate and\nappropriate knowledge of a field \u2014 such as a local professor\n\u2014 is all we need. It is not her expertise that we need so much\nashercompetencetotransmittheknowledgeofthediscipline.\nIn some cases, there may be problems in appealing to an emi-\nnentexpertforshemaybevulnerable to,orsuspectedof,bias\nbecauseofherinvolvementwithaleadingorevenadissenting\n138MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN theory.Sinceweusuallyneedtheexperttoconveytheknowl-\nedge of the discipline, eminence is not a necessary criterion.\nThe critique developed above is based on the view that a\nlarge part of knowledge is grounded not in observation or\nintuition,butinexpertconsensus.Iwishtomakefewremarks\nin support of this position. Whatever may be its theoretical\nproblems, it seems to me unquestionable that the layperson\nhas justified belief in most theoretical propositions when she\nknows these beliefs to be supported by the relevant discipline\nand has some minimal grip on the justification that supports\nthem.Iwillcalltheviewthatknowledgeisgroundedinexpert\nconsensus the \u201csocial theory of knowledge\u201d.\n9. THE SOCIAL THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE\nWhile various philosophers since Descartes have attempted\nto limit the skeptical effect of his approach, few have aban-\ndoned the essentially individualistic approach that led to the\nskepticalresult.Butwhenwestartnoticingwhichclaimspeo-\nple typically say they \u201cknow,\u201d we can easily observe that these\ninclude theoretical, general claims of their scientific culture,\nnot just claims about their own experience. For example, the\nview of the solar system as involving planets that revolve\naround the sun \u2014 indeed the picture of the solar system that\nappears in every popular text on the subject \u2014 is a view that\nmost people would rightly claim to know to be true. We also\nknow that the material world is made of atoms that combine\ntogether into molecules, that bacteria and viruses are the\ncauses of diseases, that burning is a form of rapid oxidation,\nand the list goes on. Not everyone may claim to know these,\nbutthatisatestimonytotheirignorance,nottheirinsightinto\nthetruenatureofknowledge.Andhowmanyofusknowthese\nfacts in any great depth? In particular, how many of us could\nprove or even cite the observations that prove them? Are we\nrendered into a state of mere \u201copiniatrety\u201d as a result?\nIthinktheanswerisclearlyno.Infact,asHardwigandoth-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 139 ers (Walsh, Lehrer) have pointed out, science itself involves\nmutualdependenceandtrustamongitsmembers.Thosewho\nhave shown that science is inadequately grounded in experi-\nmental evidence are correct, but this position does not have\ntoleadtorelativism.Rather,itunderlinesthecrucialrolethat\ncollective evaluation plays in the establishment of a scientific\ntheory. And the success of this social process is what justifies\nthe layperson\u2019s confidence in the results, and justifies appeal-\ning to expert pronouncements. There is much more to say\nhere (see Stitch et al. 1980, Walsh 1971, Lehrer 1977), but I\nnow wish to turn to the practical implications of my view.\n10. TEACHING AND THE SOCIAL THEORY OF\nKNOWLEDGE\nThe primary job of a teacher is to transmit knowledge. The\nteacher is not in class to share her beliefs and opinions,\nthough,ofcourse,wealldo.(Anddosorightly,butthatisnot\nour main job). We are the representatives of our disciplines\nandintheclassroomwepassontoourstudentswhatthedis-\ncipline believes is both important and true. This is seen most\neasily, perhaps, in those disciplines where course content is\nclearly delineated, such as calculus and first year physics, but\nit is similar for English 100 or even critical thinking courses\nand since I am writing for critical thinking instructors and\nsince critical thinking is my area of expertise, let me begin to\nillustratemypointbydiscussingtheroleofacriticalthinking\ninstructor.\nIt is one of the curious aspects of the discipline of critical\nthinking that the deeper epistemological worries of philoso-\nphers seldom surface in the texts or in class. Teaching intro-\nductory philosophy is always a case of teaching \u201con the one\nhand...butontheotherhand...\u201dIncriticalthinkingclasses,\nhowever, we unabashedly teach students the norms of rea-\nsoning. And we are, I would certainly argue, quite justified\nin doing so. Of course, we do not teach that our particular\n140MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN analysis of a piece of text is a case of knowledge, but we do\nteach that the \u201cfollowing considerations should be taken into\naccount when assessing a claim based on testimony.\u201d We do\nnot teach these epistemological norms as mere beliefs; rather,\nwe teach them as part of the \u201cknow how\u201d of being a critical\nthinker. This does not, and should not, preclude giving the\nrationale for these rules, but these are rules which a student\nmustknowinordertobeabletodoanalysisandarriveatrea-\nsonable beliefs about claims and arguments. We ask ourselves\nas critical thinking instructors, \u201cWhat basic rules and skills\ndoesastudentneedtoknowinordertoevaluatearguments?\u201d\nNote that we ask what a student needs to \u201cknow\u201d not \u201cneeds\nto believe?\u201d Indeed, if we ask that question, it sounds like we\nareinvolvedinmanipulation.Asteachers,weonlyhavearight\nto transmit what we know. We can, of course, tell our stu-\ndents what we believe and why, but we do not teach, instruct,\nand test them about our \u201cbeliefs.\u201d And how do we distinguish\nthejustifiablyteachableandtestablefromourotherbeliefs?Is\nit not our perception of the consensus of our discipline that\nguides us? In teaching critical thinking, as in logic and math-\nematics, we are operating in an area of significant consen-\nsus within a discipline and are authorized, therefore, to teach\n\u201cone-handed\u201d philosophy; that is, to teach the accepted theo-\nriesasknowledge.Inthosecaseswhereourownbeliefsdiffer\nfromourperceptionoftheconsensus,weareobligatedtoalert\nour students and to make this recognition govern our proce-\ndures.\n11. IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING\nIf scientific, historical, and perhaps, all theoretical knowl-\nedge is, indeed, grounded in collective decision procedures,\nespecially those of academic peer review, what are the impli-\ncationsforteachingstudentsofcriticalthinkingaboutauthor-\nity?\nThe assessment of authority must be given a more central place\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 141 in our textbooks. Equally important, it must not be understood\n(as it typically is) as simply an appeal to the claims of an indi-\nvidual with appropriate expertise, but rather as an appeal to\nthe claims supported by the consensus of the discipline, for,\nin cases of general judgments, the expert is primarily a well-\ninformed reporter.\nWemustrecognizethatmostknowledgeandinformationisgoingto\nbe supplied to our students and ourselves by experts. As a result, the\nresponsibility for the critical thinker becomes principally learn-\ning how to assess sources and expert claims. The student must\nbe taught how to do this, and, indeed, we, as teachers of critical\nthinking, must think more about this ourselves. As Hardwig\npoints out, when assessing experts we must frequently resort to\navarietyofadhominemconsiderations.Totheextentthisistrue,\nwe should supply our students with the methods of appropriate\nad hominems \u2013 for example, understanding the sociology of the\ndisciplines, reading citation indexes, identifying creditable jour-\nnals, and detecting when experts are going beyond \u201cauthorized\u201d\nclaims. We need to teach about the kind of blindness that is apt\nto infect experts, and about the fallibility and limitations of sci-\nentific claims. Wemustteachourstudents theirlegitimate right\nto question experts and how to assess their answers.

Here I have focused on only one type of claim: an\nempirical/generalclaim.Similarmodelswouldbeneededforall\nfour possible types (including empirical/particular, value/gen-\neral and value/particular).\n142MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN A says P\nP is in A\u2019s area of competence\nIs P\u2019s claim particular or general?\nIf the claim is empirical/general, then we can ask\nwhether the nature of A\u2019s discipline is fractured or\nhomogeneous?\nIf it is homogeneous, then:\nIs P a well-accepted claim in A\u2019s discipline?\nIf yes,\nWhy is P well accepted?\nIf explanation is plausible and intelligible, then P\ncan be considered knowledge.\nIf no, why does A believe P?\nIntrinsic plausibility of claim\nThe more implausible, the more evidence neces-\nsary.\nIs the justification plausible?\nAre the reasons for rejection of other positions\nplausible?\nWhat are A\u2019s credentials relative to discipline?\nWhat are A\u2019s likely biases?\nPrestige of A\nIf discipline is fractured, then weigh crediting of P\naccording to:\nNature of discipline\nIntrinsic plausibility of claim\nThe more implausible, the more evidence neces-\nsary.\nPlausibility of the explanation.\nReason for rejection other positions.\nClarity versus vagueness.\nReported depth of evidence.\nApparent objectivity of A.\nPrestige of A.\nIs the expert\u2019s claim being scrutinized by her peers?9\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 143 The model obviously needs refinement both because the\nsituation is more complicated than the model suggests and\nbecause, to be useful, the model must actually be simpler in\nits outline. But let me offer a few remarks. Note that appeals\nto authority in disciplines that are fractured and/or without\nconsensusarereallyquitedifferentthanappealstoviewssup-\nported by discipline consensus. In the former, the layperson\nmust base her judgment much more on her own assessment\nof the arguments than on the weight of the expert. And of\ncourse,intheseareas,noonecanclaimknowledge,onlyjusti-\nfiedbelief.Disciplinesthemselvesmaybesaidtohavedegrees\nof credibility.10\n12. THE IMPLICATION FOR TEACHING IN OTHER\nDISCIPLINES\nWe are far more frequently knowledge consumers than we\nare producers. Students taking introductory courses in a dis-\ncipline are unlikely to ever be producers in this area. They\nshouldbetaughtnotonlythecurrentunderstandingsbutalso\nhowtobecompetentconsumersoftheresearchinthearea(for\nexamples, reputable journals to read, methods of assessment,\nappropriate size of samples, time required for results to be\nevaluated and accepted) \u2014 basically a discipline-specific soci-\nology of knowledge. This is desirable not because this is the\n\u201cgameyouplayinbiology,\u201dbutbecausethisisthewaybiologi-\ncaltheories andevidence arevalidated; this isthewayknowl-\nedge is produced in this field.\nIreadwithsomeinterestthatMarkWeinsteinattheMont-\nclairInstituteforCriticalThinkingappearstobetryingtoget\n9.Another consideration that is sometimes mentioned in the traditional view, and fits nicely with my\nown theory, is the issue of publicity. It is reasonable to assume that authorities are much more careful\nin a situation of peer review because they can be taken to task for incorrectly representing the state of\nthe knowledge and the discipline. Given that what we want is accurate reporting, the conditions of\npublicity are relevant to weighing the experts claim.\n10.Walsh, for example, mentions philosophy's justified lack of credibility do to its fractious\nnature.\n144MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN facultytodevelopandarticulatetheirdiscipline\u2019sauthoritative\nstructure under the rubric of epistemology of the disciplines.\nWhileIamnotsayingthatepistemologyissociology(andIam\nnot arguing that Weinstein is saying this either), I do want to\nsaythatthe\u201cauthority\u201dstructureofadisciplineiscertainlyrel-\nevantforassessingclaimsandforunderstandingwhichclaims\ndeserve rational belief. For the non-expert, such information\nmaybe some of the most relevant information she can possess\nin assessing an expert\u2019s claims.\n13. SUMMARY\nThe role of authority in supporting knowledge has been\ninsufficiently articulated both in the discipline of epistemol-\nogyandintheteachingofcriticalthinking.Butbecausecritical\nthinking instruction aims to give students guidance in the\neveryday assessment of claims, it is absolutely crucial that use\nofauthoritiesandtheirevaluationbetaught.Thegoalofintro-\nductorypost-secondaryeducationshouldbetoequipstudents\ntoberational\u201cinformationconsumers\u201d\u2014individualswhocan\nthink critically about and use intelligently all sorts of claims,\nbut especially those supplied by the intellectual authorities of\ntheculture.Whetheritasacitizen,businessperson,orintellec-\ntual, a rational person\u2019s understanding of the world is consti-\ntuted largely by authoritative knowledge.

INTRODUCTION: THE DIALECTICAL APPROACH\nThe dialectical approach to teaching critical thinking has\nas its goal enhancing students\u2019 ability to make reasoned judg-\nments based on an appropriate inquiry into an issue. We have\nargued elsewhereforan approach tocritical thinking instruc-\ntion which focuses on a dialectical approach (Bailin and Bat-\ntersby 2009) and have instantiated such an approach in our\ntextbook, Reason in the Balance: An Inquiry Approach to Critical\nThinking (Bailin and Battersby 2016). This type of inquiry\ninvolves identifying and assessing the relevant pro and con\nargumentsonanissue.Suchanassessmentofargumentsmust\nusually be based on the completion of the inquiry and a com-\nparative evaluation of the arguments. The assessment of the\nweightorimportofevenindividualargumentscannotusually\nbe done apart from the context in which the arguments are\nsituated. Generally, in order to know how good an argument\nreallyis,onehastoevaluateitinitsdialecticalcontext.Judging\nhow strongly a particular set of premises supports a conclu-\nsion frequently requires more information than that supplied\nin the particular argument. For example, an assessment of the\nargumentthatcapitalpunishmentdetersandthatthereforewe\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 147 shouldbringbackcapitalpunishmentrequiresnotonlyacare-\nful examination of the evidence for the deterrence claim, but\nalso a determination of how well the argument from deter-\nrence, even if true, stands up against counter arguments to\ncapital punishment such as the problem of the execution of\nthe innocent. Neither of these arguments is fallacious and the\ncomplex assessment of their contribution to the question of\nwhether we should have capital punishment requires consid-\nering them and other relevant arguments pro and con (see\nBailin and Battersby 2016; Battersby and Bailin 2010).\n2. PRIMA FACIE EVALUATION\nThus the identification of fallacies in individual arguments\nusually cannot, in itself, constitute an adequate evaluation of\nthe strength of the argumentative support for a claim. Fallacy\nidentification can, however, play a subordinate and prelim-\ninary or prima facie role in argument assessment. Although\nprima facie judgments cannot be definitive about the cogency\nofanargument,judgmentsaboutthefallaciousnessofanargu-\nment can often be made with considerable confidence. Thus\ncertain arguments can be eliminated from further considera-\ntion.\nAsanexample,theargumentthatweshouldsupportcapital\npunishment because there is a long standing tradition of exe-\ncuting murderers can be evaluated and identified as commit-\nting a fallacious appeal to popularity or tradition. This pro-\nvides a basis for not giving consideration and weight to this\nargument in further considerations of the balancing of pros\nand cons.\nThe identification of fallacies also plays a crucial role in\nensuring that inquiry dialogues are kept on track and thus\ncontributestoarrivingatareasonedjudgmentindialoguesit-\nuations. Participants in a reasonable dialogue will attempt to\navoidmakingfallaciousargumentsandshouldbeabletoiden-\ntifyandnotbedistractedorpersuadedbyfallaciousarguments\n148MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN made by others. Nonetheless, coming to a reasoned judgment\nas a result of a thoughtful exchange of views involves much\nmore than avoiding and identifying fallacious arguments. As\nwith any inquiry, the reasoned judgment must be made by\nweighing the strength of contending arguments.1\n3. ACCOUNTS OF THE NATURE OF A FALLACY\nWhile our view of fallacies places them in a more subor-\ndinate role in argument evaluation than is typical in most\napproachestoinformallogic,westillmaintainthattheidenti-\nficationandunderstandingoffallaciesplaysanimportantrole\nininquiry.Ourcharacterizationoffallaciesdepartssomewhat\nfrom many standard accounts, however.\nWhile traditional accounts associated fallacies with inva-\nlidity, informal logicians have moved the analysis away from\ndeduction. In an extensive review of developments with\nrespect to the conceptualization of fallacies, Hansen (2002)\noffers the following summary:\nThesurveyimpressesuponusnotonlythattheontologicalcom-\nponent of fallacies as arguments is very firmly entrenched in\nthe tradition (83%), it also shows that the psychological compo-\nnent,thatafallacyappearstobeabetterthingofitskindthanit\nreally is, is widely supported (61%). Although the fallacies tradi-\ntiondoesnotsupportHHC,itdoessupportakindredgeneraliza-\ntion:afallacyisanargumentthatappearstobeabetterargument\nofitskindthanitreallyis.Noone,however,Ibelieve,hasartic-\nulated what it is to be a fallacy exactly this way (Hansen 2002,\np.152).\nThis idea that fallacies appear to be better arguments than\ntheyreallyareisacentralinsightaboutthenatureoffallacies,\nand one which is also elaborated by Walton. In commenting\nonhisownworkaswellasthatofthePragma-dialecticians,he\nmakes the following observation:\n1.For a discussion of the process of and considerations involved in such a weighing, see Bat-\ntersby and Bailin 2010.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 149 The two most fully developed theories of fallacy so far (Tindale\n1997) are the pragmatic theory (Walton 1995) and the pragma-\ndialectical theory (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992).\nAccording to the earlier version of their theory, a fallacy is a\nviolation of a rule of a critical discussion where the goal is to\nresolve a difference of opinion by rational argumentation (van\nEemeren and Grootendorst 1992). [\u2026] According to the prag-\nmatictheory(Walton1995,237-238),afallacyisafailure,lapse,\nor error that occurs in an instance of an underlying, systematic\nkindofwronglyappliedargumentationschemeorisadeparture\nfrom acceptable procedures in a dialogue, and is a serious vio-\nlation, as opposed to an incidental blunder, error, or weakness\nof execution. [\u2026] The problem is that neither theory has fully\ntaken into account that longstanding intuition, very much evi-\ndent in Aristotle\u2019s treatment of the sophistici elenchi, that fal-\nlacies are deceptive. They are not just arguments that prejudice\neffortstoresolveadifferenceofopinion,wronglyappliedargu-\nmentationschemes,ordeparturesfromacceptableproceduresin\na dialogue, although they are all that. They are arguments that\nworkasdeceptivestratagems.Theyareargumentsthatseemcor-\nrect but are not (Walton 2010, p.279).\nInanattempttoaddresswhyitisthatfallaciesseemcorrect\nbut are not, Walton suggests that the concept of heuristic may\nprovide an explanation. He notes that the heuristics involved\nareinferentialtendencieswhichbyandlargeserveuswell,but\nwhich also can on occasion lead to unwarranted inferences.\nThe work of Tversky and Kahneman has demonstrated how\nthese heuristics can lead to unwarranted inferences, while the\nwork of Gigerenzer (1999) and others has shown how these\n\u201csimple and frugal\u201d heuristics can often lead to reasonable, if\ntentative conclusions (Walton 2010).\nAccording to Walton\u2019s new analysis, the fallacy results from\nusingaheuristicwhichisoftenappropriatebutisnotareliable\nguideforthecaseinquestion.Inourview,fallaciesareindeed\narguments which seem correct but are not. Our characteriza-\ntionoffallacyattemptstocaptureandbuildonthisinsight.We\nfurther agree with Walton that heuristics could indeed be one\n150MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN of the sources of fallacious reasoning. We would argue, how-\never, that they are by no means the only source.\n4. OUR ANALYSIS OF FALLACIES\nWedefineafallacyasanargumentpatternwhosepersuasive\npower greatly exceeds its probative value (i.e., evidential\nworth). Probative value, as it is used in law, is the legal weight\nor evidential worth that a piece of evidence should be given\nwhen making a judicial finding. Evidence of high probative\nvalue includes items such as DNA and finger prints; evidence\noflowprobativevalueincludesitemssuchashearsayorobser-\nvations done under poor lighting conditions.\nImportantly,courtssometimesrefusetohearevidenceeven\nthough it has probative value.2 The refusal to hear this evi-\ndence is based on the court\u2019s belief that the evidence is too\n\u201cprejudicial,\u201d i.e., the evidence\u2019s persuasive power greatly\nexceeds its probative value. A good example of this is the pro-\nhibition on similar fact evidence. Similar fact evidence is evi-\ndence that the accused has committed previous crimes that\nwere similar to one that he is currently charged with. In our\ntextweillustratethecourt\u2019sconcernwiththefollowingexam-\nple:\n\u2026let\u2019simaginethat\u201cBill\u201disaccusedofusingaladdertogettothe\nsecondstorybalconyofanapartmentandthenenteringthrough\ntheunlockeddoorandstealingatelevisionset.Beingcaughtwith\nthestolentelevisionsetwouldhavestrongprobativevalueforhis\n2.In R. v. B., Justice McLachlin wrote: \"The analysis of whether the evidence in question is\nadmissible must begin with the recognition of the general exclusionary rule against evi-\ndence going merely to disposition.... (E)vidence which is adduced solely to show that the\naccused is the sort of person likely to have committed an offence is, as a rule, inadmissible.\nWhether the evidence in question constitutes an exception to this general rule depends on\nwhether the probative value of the proposed evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\" In\nSweitzer, Justice McIntyre of the Supreme Court of Canada wrote: \"... where similar fact\nevidence is tendered ... its admissibility will depend upon the probative effect of the evi-\ndence balanced against the prejudice caused to the accused by its admission whatever the\npurpose of its admission.\" http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/S/SimilarFactEvi-\ndence.aspx\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 151 guilt (of course he might have been given it, so it is not conclu-\nsiveevidence).Ontheotherhand,ifitturnsoutthatBillhasbeen\nconvictedofbreakingintothesecondfloorofapartmentsbefore,\nyou might think that this too is relevant evidence.\nButsuchsimilarfactevidenceisusuallynotallowedtobepre-\nsented to the court, not because it has low probative value, but\nbecause it is too persuasive. A jury (perhaps even a judge) on\nhearing that the accused has been convicted of a similar crime\nwill be strongly inclined to find this evidence very persuasive.\nToopersuasive.Butfromaprobativepointofview,thisevidence\nis very weak because Bill\u2019s particular method of crime is very\ncommon and could have easily been used by someone else. The\ncrime he is accused of is not only similar to his past crimes, but\nsimilar to crimes committed by many others, meaning that the\nsimilarfactpatternhaslowprobativevalue.Butbecausethisevi-\ndence carries so much more persuasive power than probative\nvalue,thecourtsgenerallyprohibitthepresentationofsuchevi-\ndence (Bailin and Battersby 2016, p.78).\nWecanillustratehowourconceptoffallacyworksbyapply-\ningouranalysistoanexamplefromoneofthedialoguesinour\ntext:\nMcGregor:YourfriendLesteristypicalofpeopleontheminimum\nwage.Helivesathomewithhisparents.Idon\u2019tseewhyheneeds\nalotofmoney,exceptforfrivolitieslikebeerandmovies.Sorais-\ning the minimum wage will just be helping a bunch of well off\nkidshavemorespending money.Hardlyagoodwaytohelpthe\npoor (Bailin and Battersby 2016, p.79).\nThe tendency, illustrated by McGregor, of confidently\nasserting a generalization based on one example is the com-\nmon fallacy of anecdotal evidence.Note that McGregor\u2019s exam-\nple is not irrelevant to the generalization about minimum\nwage workers \u2014 after all, this is a case supporting his gen-\neralization. Individual experiences are often relevant to sup-\nporting a generalization and can play a key role in refuting\ngeneralization. Thussuchappealstopersonalexperienceusu-\nally have some probative value. The problem is that humans\nhave a tendency to assume that their experiences are typical\n152MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN andthereforeanadequatebasisforgeneralizing.34Thefallacy\nresults from taking very limited evidence that is subjectively\npowerful and persuasive and crediting it as if it strongly sup-\nports a generalization.\nToreturntoWalton\u2019sanalysis,thisinstancecouldbeseenas\na misapplication of the representativeness heuristic described\nby Tversky and Kahneman, exactly fitting the pattern iden-\ntified by Walton. We would argue, however, that \u201cnatural\u201d\nheuristics are just one source of persuasiveness that can lead\ntocreditingargumentsgrosslyinexcessoftheprobativevalue\nof the reasons presented. In this case, the power of anecdotal\nevidence also comes from the compelling power of narrative.\nBoththeserhetoricalfactorscontributetothetendencytogive\nundoweighttowhatisafterallaverysmallandbiasedsample.\nFallacies are not just created by the misapplication of heuris-\ntics, but also by any factor which causes the argument to be\nsignificantly more persuasive than warranted by its probative\nvalue. As Walton noted in an earlier paper, emotional appeals\narealsoanaspectofmanyfallacies:\u201cEmotionalappealsarenot\nnecessarily fallacious arguments, but when they do become\ncategorized as fallacies, it is because they are weak and irrele-\nvant moves in argument\u201d (Walton 1987, p.330).\nWhat he fails to note is that in a fallacious argument, the\nemotionalappeal(whichwetaketobeanexampleoftheargu-\nment\u2019s non rational but persuasive appeal) tends to exceed\nwhatever probative value is present in the argument. In the\narticle on the ad hominem from which this quotation is taken,\nhenotesthatmanycasesofcircumstantialadhominemremarks\n3.Extensive research by Tversky, Kahneman and others on the assumption of representative-\nness supports this observation. People expect their experience to be representative just as\nthey expect a sequence of dice roles to look like a random distribution. See Tverksy and\nKahneman 1974.\n4.In a recent exchange on Argthry we were invited to share our impressions of the status of\ncritical thinking in post secondary education. Few could resist the temptation of sharing\nanecdotes, with the suggestion, either explicit or implicit, that these stories and impressions\nconstituted reasonable evidence for a generalization.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 153 about the author are relevant, especially when they provide a\nbasisforraisingdoubtsaboutthereliabilityoftheclaimsofthe\nauthor:\nThis type of ad hominem argument can be reasonable in some\ncases because inconsistency of an arguer\u2019s position should rea-\nsonably be open to criticism or questioning. However, it can\nbecome fallacious if the arguer\u2019s statement is rejected too\nstrongly, or if the issue is evaded (Walton 1987, p.327).\nWhy, then, is it a fallacy? Because what is usually inferred\nfrom the attacks on the proponent\u2019s motivation and circum-\nstances is that the position and arguments of the proponent\ncan simply be dismissed. The effect of persuading the listener\nto dismiss the argument is the persuasive effect. The ad\nhominem tends to produce a confident dismissal of an argu-\nmentwhichisnotwarranteddespitewhateverprobativevalue\ncan be given to the circumstantial considerations regarding\nthe author.\n5. APPLYING THE ANALYSIS TO FORMAL FALLACIES\nThis same analysis of a fallacy as an argument whose per-\nsuasive power greatly exceeds its probative value can also be\napplied to formal fallacies, e.g., affirming the consequent, as\ncan be demonstrated by the following simple example:\nIf the car runs, then it has fuel.\nThe car has fuel.\nTherefore it will run.\nThis argument also exhibits the characteristic of having\nsome probative value \u2014 in this case the second premise does\nprovidesomesupportfortheconclusion.Butwhenpresented\nas a deductive argument with the truth of the premises sup-\nposedly guaranteeing the truth of the conclusion, it is falla-\ncious.

PEDAGOGY\nGiven our analysis of fallacies, we describe each fallacy in\nourtextashavingtwoaspects: 1.\u201clogical error\u201d\u2013anexplana-\ntion of why the argument has limited or no probative value,\nand 2. \u201cpersuasive effect\u201d \u2013 an explanation of why the argu-\nment has a tendency to be persuasive. The most common\neffectofafallaciousargumentistoinducealevelofconviction\nunwarranted by the probative value of the argument. Some-\ntimes the persuasive effect is also destructive of an effective\ndialogue, producing not only unjustified conviction, but\nderailing the whole dialogue from its purpose. Thus, even if\nthe claim (e.g., that someone is motivated by sexism) is likely,\nthe effect on the dialogue is to switch it to a discussion of the\nparticipant\u2019s motives and awayfrom the issue in question. We\ninsist on the identification of both aspects of a fallacy because\nfailuretounderstandthepersuasiveaspectofthefallacymakes\napersonlessabletoresistitssirencallandmorelikelytomiss\nthe reasoning error that is the basis of the fallacy.\nNote that we are not claiming that all of these persuasive\naspects are necessarily intentional or even intentionally mis-\nleading. That is why we describe these fallacious persuasive\nmovesaspersuasiveeffectsnotstrategies.Fallaciousarguments\ncan, and perhaps often are, made intentionally. But we have\nall slid into fallacious reasoning unintentionally. Who has not\nover-generalized from a single experience?\nToseehowthisanalysisworks,weexcerptfromourtextour\ndescription of thead hominem.\nAd Hominem (Attacking the Proponent of an Argu-\nment):Arguers commit the fallacy of ad hominem if they reject\na proponent\u2019s argument on the basis of critical remarks about\ntheproponentratherthantheproponent\u2019sargument.Thefallacy\nis an attempt to discredit the proponent\u2019s argument or claim\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 155 by irrelevantly discrediting the proponent. To be clear, not any\npersonal attack is guilty of the ad hominem fallacy. The fallacy\nis committed only when the remarks about the proponents are\nused as grounds to inappropriately dismiss their argument.\nPersuasiveEffect:Theadhominemdiscreditsanargumentby\nattacking the author\u2019s background and behavior and shifts the\nargument to the proponent and away from the issues at hand.\nSuch a move often leads to the proponent defending his or her\npersonal behavior or background instead of staying focused on\ntheissueathand.Theuseoftheadhominemisespeciallydetri-\nmentaltoconductingadialoguebecause,notonlydoesitdistract\nfromtheissueathand,butalsoittendstoinflamepeople\u2019semo-\ntions.\nLogical Error: If the proponent has presented credible evi-\ndence and arguments, the proponent\u2019s background or behavior\nis largely irrelevant to the logical worth of the argument. When\nargumentsarepresented,theissuemustbedecidedonthemerits\nof the argument, not on the qualities of the author.\nThe situation is different if the proponent is claiming that we\nshouldaccepttheargumentbecauseofsomefactaboutthepro-\nponent, such as being an expert in the field. In such cases, eval-\nuating the source of the argument can be relevant. What makes\nad hominem remarks fallacious is not that facts about the pro-\nponent are always irrelevant but rather that we usually tend to\ngive such claims too much weight when assessing an argument.\n(Bailin and Battersby 2016, p.86).\nWe also note that some considerations about the author\u2019s\ncircumstances can be legitimate, illustrating our general point\nthat what makes ad hominem arguments fallacious is the\nexcessivedegreetowhichpeoplefindremarksaboutanauthor\na basis for dismissing their argument. But information about\nthe author is sometimes relevant because it can form part of\nthe basis on which we decide to trust the author\u2019s claims or\nbelievethatcrucialcounterarguments havenotbeen ignored.\nAs Walton notes above, one can and should use knowledge of\na person\u2019s likely biases to inform the process of evaluation of\ntheir arguments (Walton 1987).\n156MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN 7. RESPONDING TO FALLACIES\nAnother role of fallacy identification in a dialectical\napproach to critical thinking is its role in guiding an effective\nresponse. For fallacy identification to be a useful tool in rea-\nsoning and dialogue participation, a student also needs to be\nabletousethisidentificationtorespondeffectively.Whilethis\nunderstanding is useful in writing responses to arguments, it\nis especially crucial to have an effective means of responding\ntofallaciesinadialogue.Teachingstudentstoidentifyfallacies\nand their persuasive effect provides them with the means for\npreventing fallacious arguments (intentional or not) which\nmay lead the discussion off the rails.\nThe key to responding to fallacies effectively is 1) to notice\nthe persuasive effect and resist its temptation, 2) to recognize\nthelogicalerror,and3)toaddressthelogicalerrorinamanner\nthat supports the continuation of a respectful exchange of\nviews.

INTRODUCTION\nThe significance of considering the context surrounding an\nissue is underestimated and often overlooked in approaches\nto critical thinking theory and instruction based on informal\nlogic. For example, fallacies of relevance such as ad hominem\nareseenasfallaciouspreciselybecausetheyappealtothecon-\ntext rather than to the argument itself. In this paper we chal-\nlenge this view, demonstrating how and under what circum-\nstances considering context is relevant and even vital to criti-\ncal thinking.\nWe begin by arguing that the downplaying of the relevance\nof context stems from the view of critical thinking as essen-\ntiallytheevaluationofindividualarguments.Thisview,which\nbetrays the vestiges of the deductivist heritage of informal\nlogic, still underpins much critical thinking instruction.\nWe have argued, on the contrary, that critical thinking is\nbetter viewed in terms of what we refer to as critical inquiry\nin which argumentation is seen as a way of arriving at judg-\nmentsoncomplexissues.Thisisadialecticalprocessinvolving\nthecomparativeweighingofavarietyofcontendingpositions\nandargumentsinordertocometoareasonedjudgmentonthe\nissue (Bailin and Battersby 2009; Battersby and Bailin 2016).\n160MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Further, we argue that critical thinking instruction should\nfocus on this inquiry process (Bailin and Battersby 2016).\nIn the model we have developed for teaching critical think-\ning as critical inquiry, considering the context of the issue is\nanimportantcomponent.Weconsiderthefollowingaspectsof\ncontext:\n\u2022 Dialectical context\n\u2022 Current state of belief or practice\n\u2022 Intellectual, political, historical, and social contexts\n\u2022 Disciplinary context\n\u2022 Sources\n\u2022 Self\n2. THE ROLE OF VARIOUS CONTEXTS\n2.1. Dialectical context\nThe dialectical context includes the debate around an issue,\nboth current and historical. A knowledge of the dialectical\ncontext is centrally important because reaching a reasoned\njudgment involves more than simply evaluating a particular\nargument. Rather, it involves making a comparative assess-\nment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the compet-\ning views.\nToseetheimportanceofconsideringthehistoryofanargu-\nment, consider the following example. This is a standardiza-\ntionofanargumentwrittenbya\u201clifer\u201dintheMichiganprison\nsystem (from Johnson and Blair 2006):\nConclusion: We should not reinstate capital punishment in\nMichigan.\nP1.Wehavecapitalpunishmentin38statesandtheirstatistics\nshow no significant decrease in capital crimes.\nP2.

It is also connected to the fact that when criminaliza-\ntion began, marijuana\u2019s dominant use in the U.S. was by new\nMexicanimmigrants(BonnieandWhitehead1970).Arelevant\nsocial fact is that at this point in time there is an enormous\ngovernmental and police investment in drug prohibition.

A third likely consequence is that the deployment\nof police forces could shift to more clearly harmful crimes\nor could perhaps be reduced.

Disciplinary context\nDisciplinarycontextispartoftheintellectualanddialectical\ncontexts referred to above. But because disciplines are such a\ncrucial source of claims and arguments, they deserve special\nattention. Most academic evaluation occurs within a discipli-\nnarycontext.Thecriteriaofevaluationvaryinimportantways\nfrom discipline to discipline: claims from sociology cannot be\nevaluatedinthesamemannerasclaimsfromphysics.Thedis-\nciplinarycontextcanalsoincludethedialecticalhistoryofthe\n166MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN argumentwithinthediscipline.Argumentsandclaimsthatare\nnovel within the history of the discipline bear a different bur-\nden of proof than less novel claims.\nKnowledge production depends heavily on disciplines\nwhich apply varying criteria to assess claims and do so with\nvarying degrees of rigour. There are important epistemic dif-\nferences among disciplines. For example, appeals to authority\nhave varying relevance, credibility and weight depending on\nthe discipline involved. Anyone conducting a critical inquiry\nneeds to understand the difference between those disciplines\nthattendtoconsensusandthosethatdonot.Theinquireralso\nneeds to understand the inherent difficulty and uncertainty\npresented by certain forms of inquiry. Observationally based\nclaims that are common in disciplines such as epidemiology\nand sociology are by their nature more uncertain than claims\nabout particles in physics. Moreover, much of academic eco-\nnomicsisbasedonhighlyquestionablepsychologicalassump-\ntions (built into the concept of homo economicus) about human\nrationality. One only has to watch the gyrations of the stock\nmarket to see that other factors than rational assessment of\ninformation influence buying and selling.\nSupport from a consensus among experts is one of the pri-\nmary bases for crediting a claim. A layperson assessing the\ncredibility of a claim in a discipline needs to inquire whether\ntheclaimissupportedbyadisciplinaryconsensus.Disciplines\ncharacterizedby\u201cschools\u201dnotoriouslydonotdevelopthekind\nof disciplinary consensus that provides evidence for the relia-\nbility of their epistemic processes and the credibility of their\nclaims. Consensual views emerging from disciplines which\nhave a tradition of achieving consensus based on well-estab-\nlished epistemic criteria deserve our confidence. Nevertheless\nwecanneverignorethepossibilityof\u201cbandwagoning,\u201di.e.,the\ntendency of individuals to support currently popular views in\ntheir discipline for social rather than rational reasons.\nA possible example of the bandwagon phenomenon in the\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 167 disciplinesofepidemiologyandnutritionstudiesisarguedfor\nin a recent book by Taubes (2007). Taubes makes an extended\ncase against the view that fat consumption is a primary cause\nof heart disease and obesity. His position is surprising since\nthis view has been supported by hundreds of epidemiological\nstudies(largelyobservational).Taubesprovideshisownanaly-\nsis of many of these studies and reviews considerable alter-\nnative biological and epidemiological literature to support his\ncritique.Buthealsomakesthecasethatthewidespreadaccep-\ntance of this view was not the result of overwhelming scien-\ntific evidence, but rather the result of the intense efforts by\nleaders in the nutrition research community to promote their\nview. Taubes argues that adoption of an anti-fat position by\ngovernments was premature given the state of research, but\nonce governments became committed, there was little inter-\nest in questioning the fat reduction research. As Taubes docu-\nments,thesciencesupportingthebenefitsofreducingfatcon-\nsumption is actually quite inconclusive. He adds to his argu-\nmentanaccountofthepoliticalprocessbywhichreducingfat\nconsumption became government policy and a health shibbo-\nleth,includingintolerancetowardobjectorsandthemanipula-\ntionoffundingopportunitiesbykeyplayers.Inthispartofhis\nargument, he is attempting to explain why the theory that he\nis challenging could have such widespread acceptance. This is\narelevantargumentativestrategysincetheexistenceofappar-\nent consensus provides considerable support forthe \u201canti-fat\u201d\npoint of view. To the extent that he is successful, his socio/\npolitical analysis enhances his critique of this widely accepted\nposition.\nWe are not trying to judge his argument, but we do think\nthat he is justified in using this additional non-scientific evi-\ndence about the dynamics of the relevant disciplines when\nmaking his case against the \u201cfat theory.\u201d Public acceptance of\nthe \u201cfat theory\u201d depends on the assumption that the views of\nthe experts are based on an appropriate evaluation of the evi-\n168MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN dence. Evidence of social and political processes inconsistent\nwith an evidence-based approach creates a justified suspicion\nof the consensus.\n2.5. Sources\nContrary to the view that arguments should be evaluated\nindependently of their authorship to avoid the fallacy of ad\nhominem, we argue that information about who is making an\nargument is frequently relevant to evaluation (although not\ndeterminative) because the credibility of an argument often\ninvolvestrustthattheauthoroftheargumentisappropriately\nknowledgeable and fair-minded. Knowledge of the point of\nview of a source can inform the process by which arguments\nandclaimsarechecked.Inaddition,whileexplanationsofwhy\na person holds a view cannot be used to dismiss a view, such\nevidence can be used to explain why a view which is lacking\nsufficient rational support is nevertheless held.\nIt is well established that information about the source of a\nclaimorargumentisjustifiedincaseswheretrustinthesource\nis the primary basis for accepting the argument or claim. The\nacceptance of observational claims (testimony) and of claims\nbyexpertstospecialknowledgedependonthesesourcesbeing\nboth trustworthy and appropriately knowledgeable. Evidence\nthatthesourcesdonotmeetthesestandardsisalwaysrelevant\nand sometimes sufficient to dismiss their views. On the other\nhand, the evaluation of testimony and appeal to authority is\nusually cited as an exception to the general rule that the\nstrength of an argument and the credibility of its conclusion\nare independent of the source of the argument. In all other\ncases, citing circumstantial facts about the author of an argu-\nment (such as who she works for or the fact that she does not\nfollowherownenvironmentaldictums)istreatedasanirrele-\nvant and fallacious basis for rejecting an argument or conclu-\nsion.\nInourview,whatmakesadhominemargumentsfallaciousis\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 169 not that they use irrelevant information about the author, but\nthat they are usually too persuasive. For example, if someone\nof a left-leaning political orientation hears that an argument\nagainst raising the minimum wage is coming from a right-\nwing policy institute, there is a powerful temptation to just\ndismiss the view. Arguably to do so would be to commit the\nad hominem fallacy. But surely the source of the argument is\nnot irrelevant. The problem is that knowledge of the source\nis often too persuasive. Many fallacies are argument patterns\nwhose persuasive power greatly exceeds their evidential\nworth.\nAdhomineminformationcan\u201cleadusintofallacioustempta-\ntion\u201d but that does not mean that ad hominem considerations\ndo not have some rational worth. The credibility of an argu-\nmentisbasedinpartonacceptingthepremises.Inmanycases,\npart of the basis for this acceptance is the trustworthiness of\nthe author of the argument. In scientific papers we trust that\nthe anonymous author is at least not lying about the data. In\nnewspaper editorials, references to facts of the news are usu-\nallyacceptedtotheextentthatthenewspaperisatrustworthy\nsource.\nAlthoughonecanchallengeanypremise,forargumentation\nto proceed most premises will need to be accepted provided\nthat they are plausible and that the author is a trustworthy\nsource.This acceptance isnotbased ontheauthor\u2019sexpertise,\nbut rather on a judgment that the author is a trustworthy\nsource of information. In addition, the extent to which we\ncredittheconclusionisnotsimplydeterminedbytheapparent\nsupport that the premises give the conclusion. Recognizing\nthedialecticalnatureofargumentevaluationmeansthatargu-\nment evaluation must involve assessment of an argument\nagainstitscountervailingargumentsandconsideration.Who-\never presents an argument has a dialogical duty to acknowl-\nedge counter arguments and to indicate why the supported\nargument is stronger than these.

One should not dismiss an\nargument because of the political bias of its source, but such\ninformation may give rise to an appropriate skepticism about\ntheview.Intheclimatechangedebate,itisstrikingthatalmost\nallopponentsoftheanthropogenicviewappeartohavefinan-\ncial and other bases for their opposition.

While understanding a person\u2019s motivation is certainly\nnotsufficientfordismissinganargument,wewouldarguethat\nit is not irrelevant.\nThe relevance of these considerations is nicely illustrated\nin a recent column in Scientific American by Michael Shermer.\nShermerarguesagainstthewidelyheldviewthatpeopleexpe-\nriencegriefinthestages\u201cdenial,anger,bargaining,depression,\nacceptance,\u201d citing evidence from a variety of relevant experts\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 171 thatrejectsthisreigningview.Theseincludecurrentexpertsin\nthe field who claim that there are no studies that support this\nview and that in their counseling work, they do not see any\nstandard pattern.

INTRODUCTION\nA primary aim of critical thinking research and teaching is to\nimprove human reasoning with the intent of getting people to\nbe more rational with respect to their beliefs and actions. For\nthe Informal Logic/critical thinking community, this effort has\nlargely taken the form of analysing the structure of arguments\nandidentifyingcertaintypesoferrorsorproblemsinreasoning,\ninparticularthosecommonlyidentifiedasfallacies.Thefocusis\nonexposingthenatureoftheerror\u2013showingwhytheseparticu-\nlarargumentsarefallacious.Thepedagogicalassumptionunder-\nlyingthisfocusisthatoncepeopleareawareoftheseerrors,they\nwill notice them in the arguments of others and be able to resist\nthem, and that they will avoid making these errors themselves.\nMuch valuable work has been done in this area, including\ncontributions to an understanding of the nature of fallacies, the\nidentification and characterization of a growing number of fal-\nlacies, and innumerable rich ideas and strategies for teaching\ncritical thinking. The identification of reasoning errors, in this\ncontext, has been based largely on the work of philosophers\nstudying arguments and not on empirical studies of reasoners.\nIn addition, relatively little work has been done by philosophers\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 177 (with some notable exceptions, e.g., Walton 2010) on trying to\nunderstand why these errors are so common and persuasive.\nSince the 1970s, however, much important work on human\nreasoning has also been done by psychologists who have under-\ntaken systematic empirical studies of reasoning errors and pro-\nduced many insightful accounts of these errors (Wason 1966;\nWason and Shapiro 1971; Tversky and Kahneman 1974; Slovic\n1969; Slovic et al. 1977; Kahneman, Slovic and Tversky 1982;\nStanovich 2011; Kahneman 2011). Some of these errors map\nonto identified informal logic fallacies, but some of them have\nnot been previously identified by philosophers.\nThe critical thinking community has, however, by and large\ngiven little attention to the work of these cognitive psycholo-\ngists.1Itisourcontentionthatthisworkcanmakeacontribution\nbothtoreflectiononreasoningerrorsandtothedevelopmentof\nanappropriatepedagogytoinstructpeopleinhowtoavoidthese\nerrors.\nIn this paper, we explore some of the intersections between\nthispsychologicalresearchonreasoningandtheworkofcritical\nthinking theorists, as well as the implications of this research\nfor conceptualizing and teaching critical thinking.

PSYCHOLOGICAL VERSUS PHILOSOPHICAL ACCOUNTS\nAlthough both philosophers and psychologists offer detailed\naccounts of reasoning errors, there are important differences\nbetweentheaccounts.Philosophicalaccountsareprimarilynor-\nmative.Theworkofphilosophershasconsistedinspecifyingthe\nnorms of logical reasoning as well as identifying errors of rea-\nsoning which are common in arguments and showing in what\nway they are logically erroneous or epistemologically deficient.\nThe accounts of cognitive psychologists, in contrast, are\nlargely descriptive, and to some extent explanatory. Their work\nconsists in conducting empirical studies of people engaged in\ntasks that require reasoning and critical thinking. By means of\nthesestudies,theyhavebeenabletoidentifyerrorsthatarecom-\nmonlymade,identifypatternsinthetypesoferrorsmadewhich\nreflect cognitive biases (errors which are systematic and pre-\ndictable),amassevidenceregardingthefrequencyandtenacityof\nsuch errors, and investigate the circumstances which tend to be\ncorrelated with their occurrence. In addition, based on the data\naccumulated, some cognitive psychologists have also proposed\nexplanatory accounts of these cognitive biases in terms of their\nlikelyoriginsaswellasaconceptualframeworkforunderstand-\ning how they function.\n3. ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING OF REASONING ERRORS\nThe obvious question, then, is what, if anything, can such a\ndescriptive cum explanatory account add to our understanding\nthat might help us in thinking about and teaching critical think-\ning?\nThe findings of the various studies conducted by cognitive\npsychologistsdetailanextensiverangeofcognitiveerrorswhich\narecommonandpredictable.Andmanyofthefallaciesidentified\nbyinformal logiccanbeseen asparticular instances ormanifes-\ntations of certain of these cognitive biases.

The elucidation and detail-\ningofvariouscognitivebiasescangiveusaricherunderstanding\nof those errors in reasoning which have already been identified\nby informal logicians.\nManycognitivebiases describe systematic errorsinreasoning\nwhich are not among those traditionally highlighted by critical\nthinking theorists, however. A few examples are loss aversion \u2013\nwherethedisutilityassociatedwithgivingupanobjectisseenas\ngreater than the utility associated with acquiring it; and recency\nbias \u2014 the tendency to weigh recent events more heavily than\nearlier events (such cognitive biases will be discussed in more\ndetailinthenextsection).Thecognitivebiasliteraturecan,then,\naddtotherepertoireofreasoningerrorswhichdeserveattention\nby critical theorists and instructors.\nIn addition to detailing a list of errors, what the research on\ncognitive biases also indicates is that these errors are systematic\nand predictable, but also extremely widespread and very tena-\ncious. These are not errors that are made occasionally by people\nwhohavemomentarylapsesintheirthinking.Noraretheynec-\nessarily the result of people\u2019s failure to understand the relevant\nlogical norms. The research provides convincing evidence that\nthey are, rather, very common and extremely difficult to resist.\nThis is an aspect of cognitive biases that needs to be taken into\naccount in critical thinking instruction.\nAnother helpful aspect that arises from the research is infor-\nmation regarding under what conditions these errors are most\nlikely to occur and whether there are circumstances or condi-\ntions which can mitigate them. This type of information can be\n180MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN usefulforcriticalthinkinginstructioninprovidingabasisforthe\ndevelopment of strategies to help avoid these errors.\nInadditiontotheguidanceprovidedbytheresearchitself,the\nexplanatoryaccountsofferedbycognitivepsychologistsalsogive\nusaframeworkforattemptingtounderstandwhywemakethese\nerrors.Theubiquityandtenacityofcognitivebiasesdemonstrate\nthatthesearenotsimplyerrorsinreasoning;theyareerrorsthat\npersuade. The theoretical accounts offer an explanation for why\nit may be that we are persuaded by them.\nTheseaccountsdifferfromthosegenerallyofferedbyphiloso-\nphers,whichtendtoviewtheprimarysourceofhumanunreason\nas the emotions (the explanations of reasoning errors offered in\ncontemporarytextbooks,forexample,tendtobeintermsofego\ninvolvement or ethnocentrism). While not denying that emo-\ntional sources can often be a cause of irrationality, the work of\ncognitive scientists has shown that many reasoning errors are\ngrounded primarily in natural reasoning processes.\nWhat many psychologists have argued is that humans have,\nover time, evolved a set of quick inferences tendencies which\nallow a rapid, almost immediate response or reaction. Some\nexamples of these quick inferences are detecting hostility in a\nvoice, driving a car on an empty road, understanding a simple\nsentence, or answering a simple math problem. Some of these\nfast mental activities are innate and automatic while others are\nbased on skills and knowledge which have become automatic\nthroughprolongedpractice(e.g.,drivingonanemptyroad,solv-\ning a simple math problem) (Kahneman 2011, pp.21-24). This\ntype of thinking is referred to by Kahneman (2011) as System\n1 or fast thinking.2 This type of quick inference-making is suffi-\ncientlyreliabletostandusingoodsteadinmanycircumstances,\nproviding quick and generally appropriate initial reactions to\nchallenges under routine conditions. But such fast thinking can\nalso lead to cognitive biases as these immediate, unreflective\n2.This type of thinking has been referred to variously as automatic, experiential, heuristic,\nimplicit, associative, intuitive, and/or impulsive (Evans 2008).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 181 inference-tendenciesarenotadequatetothetaskofdealingwith\nmore complex challenges. Tasks such as performing complex\ncalculations,monitoringtheappropriateness ofone\u2019sbehaviour,\ncomparing items for overall value, or checking the validity of\na complex logical argument require attention, deliberate mental\neffort, and conscious reasoning. This type of more deliberate,\ncontrolled, and effortful thinking is referred to by Kahneman as\nSystem2orslowthinking.3AccordingtoKahneman,slowthinking\nis required in order to avoid cognitive biases.\nSo why are cognitive biases so persuasive? The two systems\ntheory would suggest that they persuade us because they arise\nfrom natural inferential tendencies. These tendencies are quick\nand cognitively easy and are generally the first line of attack\nwhen we are faced with cognitive challenges. Moreover, it is\nrational inmanycircumstances torelyonthesetendencies; they\narewhatallowustofunctionmostofthetime.Buttheycanlead\nto errors in some circumstances and it is important in such cir-\ncumstancestoinstitutestrategiestobecomemorecontrolledand\ndeliberate. The cognitive bias research suggests that this is not\nalways easy as fast thinking occurs automatically. But it is possi-\nble.\nWhile these theoretical accounts provide a plausible expla-\nnation of the persuasive power of cognitive biases in general,\naccounts of particular cognitive biases may also help us under-\nstand why particular errors are persuasive. This is an element\nthathas been missing inmostaccounts offallacies inthecritical\nthinking literature. Fallacies are typically identified in terms of\nwhat is erroneous about them. But fallacies are not just any\nerrors in reasoning; they are persuasive errors (Battersby and\nBailin 2015; Walton 2010). It is the existence of underlying cog-\nnitive biases which make the fallacious inferences tempting.\nThus we would argue for the need to conceptualize fallacies not\n3.This type of thinking has been referred to variously as controlled, rational, systematic,\nexplicit, analytic, conscious, and/or reflective (Evans 2008). See Evans for an overview of a\nnumber of dual-systems theories of reasoning and cognition.\n182MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN only in terms of the errors they exemplify, but also in terms of\ntheir persuasive power.4 Understanding why particular fallacies\npersuade us provides us with a tool for helping us to resist their\nthrall.\nFor example, while philosophers have identified the error of\nmaking hasty generalizations based on anecdotal evidence, cog-\nnitive psychologists have identified the cognitive bias of the\n\u201cavailability heuristic\u201d (estimating what is more likely by what is\nmore available in memory, which is biased toward vivid, emo-\ntionally charged, or easily imagined examples (e.g., a plausible\nstory). In a famous study, Tversky and Kahneman (1983) asked\nwhich was more likely:\n1. a massive flood somewhere in North America this year, in\nwhich more than 1,000 people drown\n2. an earthquake in California sometime this year, causing a\nflood in which more than 1,000 people drown.\nDespite the fact that what is described in statement #2 is\nincluded in statement #1, a large percentage of people found\nstatement#2morelikelysincethelatterprovidesamoreplausi-\nble and easily imagined story. The philosophical accounts iden-\ntify this reasoning as an error; the psychological accounts tell us\nthat we tend to be persuaded by this particular error because\npeople generally have a strong tendency to make judgments of\nlikelihood on the basis of ease of imagining an event, an ease\nwhich can be much facilitated by a plausible story (Kahneman\n2010, pp.159-60).\nAnother example is provided by the fallacy of questionable\ncause, which has been pointed out by critical thinking theorists,\nbut the tendency to commit this fallacy can be seen to be\n4.In Reason in the Balance (Bailin and Battersby 2016), we define a fallacy as an argument\npattern whose persuasive power greatly exceeds its probative value (i.e., evidential worth).\nWe then describe each fallacy in terms of two aspects: 1. \u201clogical error\u201d \u2013 an explanation of\nwhy the argument has limited or no probative value, and 2. \u201cpersuasive effect\u201d\u2013 an explana-\ntion of why the argument has a tendency to be persuasive.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 183 grounded in the strong tendency, identified by psychologists, to\nsee causal relationships even between unrelated events in order\nto make a coherent story. This phenomenon is nicely illustrated\nby an experiment by Hassin, Bargh and Uleman (2002) in which\nparticipants were given the following to read:\nAfter spending a day exploring beautiful sights in the crowded\nstreets of New York, Jan discovered that her wallet was missing.\nWhen asked to recall the story afterwards, participants asso-\nciated the word pickpocket with the story more frequently than\ntheydidthewordsightsdespitethefactthatsightsappearedinthe\nstorywhilepickpocketdidnot.Thejuxtapositionoftheideaslost\nwallet, New York, and crowds prompted participants to infer a\ncoherentcausalstorytoexplainthelossofthewalletdespitethe\nlackofanyevidencepresentedinthestorytosupportthisinfer-\nence.\nAn important aspect of System 1 or fast thinking highlighted\nby cognitive psychologists is that it is coherence-seeking \u2013 it is\npronetoconstructacoherentstoryoutofwhateverinformation\nisavailable,whateveritsqualityandhoweverlimited.Acommon\nerrorinreasoningwhichisaresultofthistendencyisjumpingto\nconclusions(hastyconclusion),andaparticularlytroublingman-\nifestation is the failure to look at both sides of an issue or to\nseek alternatives. A striking illustration of this phenomenon is\nprovided by one study (Brenner, Koehler and Tversky 1996) in\nwhich participants had to make a decision based on one-sided\nevidence.Alltheparticipantsweregiventhesamescenariospro-\nviding background material to a legal case, but then one group\nheardonlyapresentationbythedefencelawyer,onegroupheard\nonlyapresentationbytheprosecutor,andonegroupheardboth\npresentations (each lawyer framed the issue differently but nei-\ntherpresentedanynewinformation).Despitethefactthatallthe\nparticipants were fully aware of the setup and could easily have\ngeneratedtheargumentfortheotherside,thepresentationofthe\none-sided evidence had a significant effect on the judgments.\n184MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Moreover, the consideration of only one side of the issue also\nresulted in the bias of overconfidence. The participants who\nheard one-sided evidence were more confident of their judg-\nmentsthanthosewhoheardbothsides.Thisisnotsurprisingas\nit is easier to construct a coherent story with less information.\nThe strength of this tendency to make confident judgments\nbased on limited evidence is a robust and significant finding of\nthe cognitive bias research and strongly suggests the need for\ndeliberate measures and strategies to counter this tendency.\n4. IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL ERRORS IN REASONING\nThe list of errors in reasoning identified by the cognitive sci-\nence research which go beyond those typically identified by\nInformal Logic is too lengthy to detail here. We shall, instead,\nfocus on one of the most striking discoveries by Kahneman and\nTversky, the phenomenon of anchoring \u2014 the influence of irrel-\nevant initial information when estimating a value or making a\njudgment. In the standard research example, subjects are given\na random number, a number which they know is random, and\nthen asked questions such as how many of the states in the UN\nare from Africa. Those given a larger number guess a relatively\nlargernumberofAfricanstatesandthosegivenasmallernumber\nestimate a smaller number of states. We all recognize that when\nnegotiating, it is common practice for the seller to price her\nobjecthighandforthebuyertotryandlowball.Butthesestrate-\ngies, while they may be exploiting the phenomena of anchoring,\nalso introduce relevant considerations. They give us some idea\nwhat price the seller or buyer is seeking. What is striking about\nthephenomenonofanchoringisthattheanchoringnumbersare\nknown to the subjects to be irrelevant. This might seem to be\njustaquirkycuriousfactabouthumanpsychology,butanumber\nof studies have demonstrated that it is a phenomenon with pro-\nfound social implications.\nIn one study, for example, German researchers examining the\neffectsofanchorsonjudicialdecision-makingwereabletoshow\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 185 thateventrainedjudgesknowingthattheinformationtheywere\ngivenwasirrelevantwerestillinfluencedintheirdecision-mak-\ning in a manner similar to the na\u00efve subjects described above.\nThe researchers ran a number of different experiments provid-\ning the judges with information of varying degrees of relevance.\nInoneexample,participantswerepresentedwitharealisticcase\ndescription of an alleged rape and were told that during a court\nrecesstheyreceivedatelephonecallfromajournalistwhoasked\n\u201cDo you think that the sentence for the defendant in this case\nwill be higher or lower than 1 (or 3) years?\u201d Subsequently, they\nwere asked for their own decision and also asked how certain\nthey felt about the decision. Participants who had been exposed\nto the high anchor chose a considerably higher sentences (mean\n33months,standarddeviationof9.6)comparedtothosewiththe\nlow anchor (mean 25 months, standard deviation 10) and par-\nticipants generally felt fairly certain about the decision. Other\nexperiments have yielded similar, troubling results (Englich\n2006).\n5. ENHANCING CRITICAL THINKING INSTRUCTION\nIn what ways might this research inform and help to enhance\ncritical thinking instruction? Cognitive psychological accounts\nsuggest that noticing that we are succumbing to the influence of\nacognitivebiasisactuallyquitedifficult.AsKahnemansuggests,\n\u201cThe best we can do is \u2026 learn to recognize situations in which\nmistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes\nwhen the stakes are high\u201d (Kahneman 2011, p.28).\nRecognizingcertaininferencesaserrorsiscertainlyasinequa\nnon for avoiding such mistakes, and critical thinking pedagogy\nhas focused effectively on this task. It is not sufficient, however.\nThe cognitive bias research has demonstrated just how strong\nand ubiquitous are these tendencies. Thus we would argue that\nhelping students to see the naturalness and allure of cognitive\nbiaseswouldbeimportantforhelpingthemtoresisttheirpull.In\nparticular,wehavearguedfortheneedtoteachstudentstoiden-\n186MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tifyfallaciesnotonlyintermsoftheerrorstheycommitbutalso\nin terms of their persuasive power.5\nOne of the most important points to emerge from the cogni-\ntive bias literature with implications for pedagogy is the neces-\nsitytoputthebrakesonourtendencytorushtoinferenceunder\ncertain circumstances. Dealing with complex mental challenges\nand drawing complex inferences require the kind of deliberate,\ncontrolled, and effortful thinking characteristic of System 2 or\nslowthinking.Thuswhatisrequiredwhentryingtomakeajudg-\nment is aconscious attempt tomakeourthinking moredeliber-\nate. Strategies such as following a procedure or a set of guiding\nquestions (Bailin and Battersby 2016, pp.26-36) and consciously\nmonitoring our thinking process (Bailin and Battersby 2016,\npp.274-275) are essential aspects of rational decision making.\nIn addition, it is possible to institute strategies to counter the\neffects of some of these quick inferential tendencies. The ten-\ndency to make confident judgments on the basis of limited evi-\ndence seems to be particularly strong and one manifestation of\nthis tendency is the failure to look at both sides of an issue or\nto seek alternatives (sometimes called \u201cmy side bias\u201d by cogni-\ntive psychologists). The common habit of philosophers of seek-\ning counterexamples to any claim is a crucial antidote for this\ntendency. The strategy of actively seeking out counter evidence\nto one\u2019s views, looking for and seriously considering the argu-\nments on various sides of an issue, and deliberately considering\nalternativepositionswhenmakingajudgmentcangoalongway\ntoward countering this tendency of rushing to judgment. The\ndevelopment of the habit of considering counterexamples and\nalternativesisacrucialaspectofcriticalthinkinginstructionand\nis necessary in order to frustrate the natural tendency to leap to\nconclusions.\nThe cognitive bias research has also served to highlight the\npower of the framing effect \u2013 the tendency to draw different\n5.See note #4.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 187 conclusions from the same information depending on how that\ninformation is presented (for example, people are more likely to\nacceptariskiftheyaretoldthatthereisa10%chanceofwinning\nrather than a 90% chance of loosing). Deliberately attempting to\nreframe or change the way one views a situation may be help-\nfulincounteringthistendency.Forexample,onecanattemptto\nview marijuana use as a harm issue rather than as a crime issue\nand see what effect this has on one\u2019s judgment about the legal-\nization of marijuana. The question then becomes: how do the\nharmsresultingfromillegalitycomparetoanyreasonablyantic-\nipated harms to health? When engaging in argumentation, one\ncan try to view the enterprise in terms of making the best judg-\nment rather than in terms of winning or losing. And trying to\nidentifywithbeingreasonableratherthanwithaparticularview\ncan be a helpful strategy for developing open-mindedness and\nfair-mindedness in inquiry (Bailin and Battersby 2016, p.274).\nThe bias of overconfidence \u2013 the tendency to have more con-\nfidenceinone\u2019sjudgmentthaniswarrantedbytheweightofevi-\ndence \u2013 is another common cognitive bias which may be some-\nwhat mitigated through deliberate efforts. The strategies out-\nlined above for promoting an examination of the full range of\nargumentsonallsidesofanissueisnecessaryinordertomakea\njudgment with the appropriate degree of confidence, as is mak-\ning students aware of the need to give explicit consideration to\nhow much weight various arguments carry in making an over-\nall judgment (Battersby and Bailin 2011, pp.152-157; Bailin and\nBattersby 2016, pp.239-244).\nAn important concept which runs through the cognitive bias\nliteratureisthatofmentaleffort.FastThinkingisquickandeasy,\nvirtuallyeffortless,butslower,moredeliberatethinkingrequires\nmore mental effort. Kahneman and others have suggested that\nour minds have a tendency to go for the easier route much of\nthe time (Kahneman 2010, pp.39-49). For example, the research\nhas shown repeatedly that people have a strong tendency to see\nan erroneous answer to a simple math problem as correct or\n188MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN an invalid syllogism as valid when the conclusion is believable\n(thebeliefbiaserror)(Evans2008).Theintuitiveanswersuggests\nitself immediately and people generally do not bother to check\nthe reasoning. These are cases when the reasoning could be\ncheckedwithouttoomuchdifficulty.Nonethelessoverridingthe\nintuitive response requires some mental work, and most people\ndo not appear to be initially inclined to put in this effort.\nAnimportantideaforourpedagogicalpurposesisKahneman\u2019s\nargument that this failure is due at least in part to insufficient\nmotivation (2010, p.46).

INTRODUCTION\nIn his paper, \u201cMissed Opportunities in Argument Evalua-\ntion,\u201d Cohen (2015) has in his sights a \u201ccurious\u201d asymmetry in\nhow we evaluate arguments: while we criticize arguments for\nfailing to point out obvious objections to the proposed line of\nreasoning, we do not consider it critically culpable to fail to\ntakeintoaccountargumentsfortheposition.Cohenviewsthis\nomissionasamissedopportunity,forwhichhelaystheblame\nlargely at the metaphorical feet of the \u201cDominant Adversar-\nial Model\u201d of argumentation \u2013 the DAM account. We argue\nhere that while Cohen criticizes the DAM account for con-\nceptualizing arguments as essentially agonistic, he accepts its\nbasic framing and does not follow his critique where it leads.\nIn so doing, he misses the opportunity to develop an alterna-\ntive, non-adversarial account of argumentation which would\navoid his criticism of how we evaluate arguments.\n2. MISSED OPPORTUNITY\nLet us exam in more detail the conundrum that motivates\nCohen\u2019s paper. His focus is the kinds of argumentative moves\nwhich are problematic and for which proponents of argu-\n192MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ments can and should be held accountable. Among these is\nthe failure to address relevant objections to one\u2019s argument.\nIn such cases, it is part of the mandate of the opponent to the\nargument to point out such an omission, and failure to do so\nmeans being remiss in his or her dialectical obligation.\nCohen notes, however, that missing relevant arguments in\nsupport of one\u2019s position is equally problematic as it lessens\nthe potential strength of the argument, yet we do not hold\narguersaccountableforsuchomissions.Pointingoutthisfail-\nure is not part of the mandate of the opponent of the argu-\nment, and indeed is in tension with this mandate. Nor is it\ntheresponsibility oftheother,non-directparticipants suchas\nevaluators, judges, or audience, as they are to remain neutral\nwith respect to the actual argumentative exchange.\nCohen summarizes the problem thus:\nOn the one hand, it is taken as fair game to point out obvious\nobjections to a line of reasoning that have not been anticipated.\nArguments that fail to do this are not as strong as they could\nbe and should be. Elementary critical thinking textbooks and\nadvanced argumentation theorists all agree that the failure to\ncriticize an argument for failing to take relevant and available\nnegative information into account would be critically culpable.\nOfcourse,argumentsthatfailtotakerelevantandavailableposi-\ntiveinformationintoaccountarealsonotasstrongastheycould\nbe and should be, but those same voices are curiously silent on\nthis omission (Cohen 2015, p.121).\nCohenclearlybelievesthatthissituationisunfortunate,that\nitwouldenhancethequalityoftheargumentationifthisomis-\nsionwerepointedout,andthattheabsenceofthistypeofpos-\nitive,constructivecriticalengagementisamissedopportunity.\n3. DAM\nOne of the main sources of this asymmetry is, according\nto Cohen, the Dominant Adversarial Model of argumentation\n(henceforth know as DAM). DAM frames argumentation as\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 193 essentially an adversarial enterprise in which arguers are\nopponents or enemies in a battle to win. Offering arguments\nsupportive of an opponent\u2019s position would then be ruled out\nastantamountto\u201cgivingaidandcomforttotheenemy.\u201dMore-\nover, the required neutrality of those participants not directly\ninvolvedinthe\u201cbattle\u201d(suchasjudgesandaudiencemembers)\neliminates them as a possible source for this type of helpful\ncriticism. Thus there is no one in a position to point out\nmissed opportunities.\n4. ADVERSARIALITY\nIn advancing his critique of DAM, Cohen adds his voice to\nthose of a substantial number of theorists who have decried\nthe dominance of battle metaphors in argumentation and the\nframing of argumentation as essentially agnostic (Lakoff and\nJohnson 1980, Blair 1987, Moulton 1989, Ayim 1991, Bailin\n1992, Cohen 1995, Govier 1999, Rooney 2010, Hundleby\n2013).Thistypeofadversarialstanceprizeswinningoverrea-\nsonedjudgmentandunderminesco-operation,open-minded-\nness, and a willingness to concede to the strongest reasons.\nHundleby, in her analysis of Govier\u2019s view of adversariality,\nmakes the point thus:\nAdversarial and aggressive metaphors can foster interpersonal\naggression,encouragingpeopletoslideintoarguingagainsteach\nother when they disagree rather than just questioning each\nother\u2019s ideas. Adversarial structures in law, politics, and debate,\nandthepersonalstakeweoftenhaveinourownviewsheighten\nthe likelihood that opposing opinions will slip into aggressive\nmodes that interfere with rational exchange (Hundleby, p.240).\nCohenfurthermaintainsthatthesemetaphorscaninterfere\nwith our rational goals since they tend to presuppose that:\nthesubjectathandcanbecarvedintodistinctandopposingposi-\ntions, and this tends to squeeze the discussion of even the most\ncomplex questions into a black-and-white view of the world\n(Cohen 1995, pp.180-181).\n194MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN It has been argued, by Govier (1999) among others (e.g.,\nHundleby,Mouffe,Rooney),thatsomedegreeofadversariality\nis necessary in debates over controversial issues since contro-\nversy, by its nature, involves the confrontation of opposing\nviews:\nIt would appear that in any controversy there must be propo-\nnentsandopponentsofvariousviews.Insofarasweareengaged\nin a controversy, we will be arguing with others who disagree\nwith us and are, in that sense at least, ouropponents orantago-\nnists (p.247).\nAnd further:\nTheexistenceofcontroversyisahealthythinginmanycontexts,\nand if controversy implies a degree of adversariality, then per-\nhapssomemodestadversarialityisacceptableintheinterestsof\ncritical thinking and lively debate (p.51).\nThe type of adversariality supported by Govier is what she\ncalls minimal adversariality:\nI would submit that argument is not necessarily confrontational,\nandthatadversarialitycanbekepttoalogical,andpolite,mini-\nmum\u2026Iamconcernedtoshowthatargumentmayembracethe\npositivegoalsofpersuasionandjustificationwithoutnecessitat-\ning adversariality in any negative sense (p.55).\nIt is clear that the type of adversariality which Govier sup-\nports is not that suggested by the argument-as-battle\nmetaphors nor the winning-at-all costs view of argumenta-\ntion, of which she is highly critical. To the extent that her\nargumentisreferringtoadversarialityinthesenseofthecon-\nfrontation of opposing views, we would tend to agree: getting\nthe strongest arguments on various sides of an issue on the\ntable for consideration is crucial for the comparative evalua-\ntion of arguments about controversial issues.\nAdversarialityforGovierseemstogobeyondtheconfronta-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 195 tion of opposing views, however, to encompass a confronta-\ntion between arguers:\nWhenweargueforaclaim,weatthesametime,andnecessarily,\nargueagainstanenvisionedopponent,onewhodoesnotaccept\nthe claim (p.243).\nHer characterization of an adversarial practice as one in\nwhich\u201cpeopleoccupyroleswhichsetthemagainsteachother,\nas adversaries or opponents\u201d (p.242) seems to confirm this, as\ndoes her reference in the quote above to those who disagree\nwith us as opponents or antagonists.\nThis slide from \u201carguing for claims\u201d to \u201carguing against peo-\nple who disagree with those claims\u201d is, we would argue, prob-\nlematic (as Govier herself seems, in places, to acknowledge).1\nMoreover, viewing the person holding the opposing position\nas one\u2019s opponent introduces an unnecessary and unhelpful\nelement of adversariality (Rooney, p.221). As Rooney states:\n[W]hy are youmy \u201copponent\u201d if youare providing me with fur-\ntheroralternativeconsiderationsinregardtoX...whetherIend\nup agreeing with X or not-X?

THE DAM DILEMMA\nThe critique of the DAM account is at the heart of Cohen\u2019s\nargument, but in our view, it does not go far enough. The\nconundrum which motivates the paper is, we would argue,\na consequence of this failure to follow the critique where it\nleads. On the one hand, Cohen argues that argumentation\nshould not be viewed as adversarial, that interlocutors should\nbeseenascolleaguesorpartnersinargumentationratherthan\nas opponents and enemies, and that arguers should help each\nother by pointing out missed opportunities. On the other\nhand, he accepts the language and assumptions of the DAM\naccount, that is, he frames the issue in terms of proponents\nand opponents (and \u201csupporting cast\u201d). The problem is that\nopponents are not supposed to help each other (nor are the\nsupporting cast supposed to help the main players). Cohen is\nnot happy with this situation and is trying to find a way to\ninterpret the roles in such a way as to allow for such help.\nNonetheless, the language of \u201cproponents\u201d and \u201copponents\u201d\npresupposes adversariality:\nWhen we talk about opponents, about adopting and defending\npositions, scoring points, or, simply, winning and losing argu-\nments,itisdifficulttoknowhowwemightarticulatethethings\nwe mean by these phrases without using these warring and\nrelated sports metaphors (Rooney, p.211).\nWe might imagine a parallel conundrum to Cohen\u2019s with\nrespect to a child\u2019s cooperative game. In this type of game,\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 197 playersdonotcompetewitheachotherbutinsteadmustwork\ntogether to overcome some common obstacle. Thus, one\nmight say that the opponents in this game should not view\ntheotherplayersasadversaries,whichmeansthattheyshould\nwork together and help each other. But helping each other is\nantithetical to the role of opponents, so we have a problem.\nClearly, in this context, it makes no sense to speak in terms\nof opponents the way one might in a traditional competitive\ngame. The language of opposition only makes sense in a con-\ntext where winning is the goal, that is, in an adversarial con-\ntext.\n6. THE PROBLEM WITH ROLES\nOneofthemainreasonsforCohen\u2019sacceptanceoftheDAM\nlanguage is his commitment to the notion of roles in argu-\nmentation.Thepuzzleregardingmissedopportunitiesispred-\nicated upon arguers having defined roles in argumentation\nwhich generate particular duties and expectations. Cohen\nexplains it thus:\nWhat emerges, then, is a more or less natural division of labor\nand division of expectations for the participants in arguments:\n\u2022 Proponents are expected to find good reasons for their positions,\nso they can be criticized when they do not.\n\u2022 Opponents are not expected to point those reasons out for the\nproponentswhentheydon\u2019tpresentsuchreasons,sotheycannot\nbe criticized for remaining silent.\n\u2026\n\u2022 Criticsareexpectedtonotemissedopportunities,sotheyshould\nbe open to criticism for their silence on that score [although\nCohen further notes that the expectations of impartiality and\nnon-interference preclude them from taking on this\nresponsibility].\n\u2022 Judges, juries, and audiences do have critical roles, so they can\nbe expected to take note of missed opportunities, but they are\n198MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN not expected to point them out and, in many cases, expected to\nremainneutral,i.e.,nottointerfereandtorefrainfrompointing\nthem out (Cohen 2015, p.125).\nThis neat division into roles is problematic, however, as\nCohenhimselfacknowledges.Rolesarefluidandoftenoverlap\nin practice, thus making it difficult to separate them:\nWemaystartoutintheproponent\u2019sprimarylogicaltaskofargu-\ning for a position but then find ourselves in the subsidiary,\ndialectical task of defending it against objections or revising it in\nlightofthoseobjections,andthenwemightendupasanoppo-\nnent arguing against a contrary position. Similarly, objecting to\napro-argument,anotheroppositionrole,presupposesargument\nevaluation,acritic\u2019sactivity.AsvanRadziewsky2013notes,the\ntransitions are continual, effortless, and seamless (Cohen 2015,\np.124).\nThis fluidity of roles is, he argues, a source of contradictory\nexpectations on arguers; for example, critics can be expected\nto note missed opportunities but are also expected to be\nimpartial and thus should not point them out.\nGiven the fluidity of roles, the impossibility of separating\nthem,andtheparadoxesgeneratedbytheresultingconflicting\nrole expectations, one might wonder about the utility of the\nconcept of roles in thinking about argumentation. The situa-\ntionsinwhichtheconceptismostapplicablearethosethatare\nformally structured as adversarial and involve clearly defined\nroles, for example the courtroom or a formal debate. Even in\nsuch cases, however, the participants need to perform a num-\nber of different dialectical tasks in fulfilling their roles, e.g., a\ndefense attorney will propose alternative arguments; a pros-\necuting attorney will need to defend his arguments against\nobjections; a supreme court judge may question apparent\nproblemsorweaknessesinlawyers\u2019arguments.Moreover,the\narguments offered by Cohen and others (including ourselves)\nsuggest that such formally structured cases are not paradig-\nmatic of argumentation. The concept of role would seem to\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 199 have little applicability, as least with respect to identifying\nexpectations for particular arguers in other contexts.\nNonetheless, Cohen is intent on defending the existence of\ndistinct roles, claiming that, although they are intertwined in\npractice, they are conceptually distinguishable in theory and\nusefulinanalyzingarguments.Theconceptofroleisambigu-\nous,however.Itcanrefertoaparticularindividualperforming\naparticulartask,e.g.,anopponentinanargument,whoserole\nis to argue against a position and who has certain dialecti-\ncal obligations with respect to this role. The argument to this\npoint has, however, shown this notion of role to be problem-\natic (with the exceptions noted above).\nWemightinsteadconceiveofthevariousrolesinargumen-\ntation in terms of aspects. There are various aspects to argu-\nmentation, various dialectical tasks involved in the practice,\nforexample,coming upwithanargument, finding objections,\nevaluating arguments, revising positions, generating alterna-\ntive arguments, and so on. These tasks may be performed by,\nshared among, and even switched between various numbers\nor combinations of individuals. They may be performed by\ntwoindividualsarguingdifferentpointsofview,buttheymay\nequally be done by one person in an individual inquiry, by a\ngroupofindividualsengagedinsolvingaproblem,bypresen-\ntersandcommentators,andsoon.Itisimportantforsuccess-\nfulargumentationthatthevarioustasksbeperformed,butthe\ndivision of labor is, we would argue, incidental. We agree that\nthe concept of role in the sense of aspects can be useful in\nanalyzing the tasks of argumentation, but it is generally not\nhelpful as a way to categorize arguers, except in adversarial\ncontexts.\nWe would also contest Cohen\u2019s claim that the notion of\ndifferent roles is useful because the different roles have dif-\nferent goals, they require different skill-sets, and they follow\ndifferent rules which generate different expectations (Cohen\n2015, p.124). Although it is possible to make conceptual dis-\n200MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tinctions among aspects, for example, between constructing\narguments and evaluating arguments, these aspects are inter-\ntwined and inseparable in practice. For example, constructing\narguments integrally involves critical evaluation. Such con-\nstructions most often arise from the recognition of problems\nin other arguments, they involve building a coherent chain of\nreasoningconformingtothecriticalstandardsthatguideeval-\nuation, and they must take into account any logical vulnera-\nbilitiesintheargument.Similarly,argumentcriticisminvolves\nconstructive aspects such as the interpretation of arguments,\nsupplyingmissingpremisesandunstatedassumptions,coming\nup with counter-examples, constructing a cogent argument\nto support the critique, and revising one\u2019s argument in the\nlight of objections and alternative arguments. Argument con-\nstructionandevaluationare,thus,inseparableandintertwined\naspects of the same process. Nor should the constructive and\nevaluativeaspectsbeviewedasseparateanddistinctprocesses\nwhich take place sequentially. One does not simply generate\narguments in an unconstrained, non-evaluative way and then\nchooseamongthemusingcriticaljudgment.Rather,theargu-\nments one comes up with are based on an evaluation of other\narguments and involve critical judgments in their construc-\ntion. Thus one evaluates in the process of constructing. Simi-\nlarly, the various constructive aspects of evaluation described\nabove mean that one constructs in the process of evaluation.\nPerhaps a less ambiguous way to frame Cohen\u2019s insight that\ntheargumentativeenterpriseinvolvesgoinginandoutofvar-\nious roles is to conceive of it in terms of performing various\ninterrelated dialectical tasks (Bailin 2003).\n7. EPISTEMOLOGICAL VERSUS DIALECTICAL\nCONCEPTIONS\nAt the heart of the conundrum with which Cohen is strug-\ngling is, we believe, a deeper tension between two different\nperspectives on argumentation, dialectical and epistemologi-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 201 cal. On the one hand, Cohen\u2019s discussion of roles is grounded\ninadialecticalperspectiveonargumentationwhichfocuseson\nargumentation as a social practice. Argumentation takes place\nin a variety of contexts and is structured in various ways in\npractice.Thereareformallystructuredcontextssuchastradi-\ntionallystructureddebatesandargumentationinacourtroom,\nin which there is a clear division of labour with respect to the\nargumentative tasks and clear expectations of those who play\nthe various roles. These are contexts in which there are for-\nmally declared winners and losers, and which are thus inher-\nently adversarial. But there are many other ways in which\nargumentation is conducted in practice including an individ-\nual trying to persuade another of his or her position (in a dis-\ncussion, a speech, an editorial, letter to the editor, or blog,\netc.), an individual deliberating about an issue, several people\ninquiring together in a collaborative group, and individuals\nwith differing views trying to come to an agreed-upon judg-\nment.\nBut there is also another perspective on argumentation at\nplayhere, implicit, and attimes explicit, in Cohen\u2019s argument,\nthat is an epistemological perspective. The focus here is on\nthe overarching goals of argumentation. Regardless of how\nargumentation may be structured in different contexts, the\nunderlying goal is seen as an epistemological one. There are\nvariations in how this goal is cashed out by different theorists\n\u2014 to yield knowledge or reasonable belief (Biro and Siegel\n1997,2006),toleadtorationallyjustifiedbelief(Lumer2005),\nto come to a reasoned judgment (Bailin and Battersby 2009,\n2016), the bettering of our belief systems (van Radziewsky\n2013) \u2014 but all are versions of epistemic goals.\nCohen (2014) explicitly cites an epistemic goal for argu-\nmentation,\u201cthebetteringofourcognitivesystems.\u201dHefurther\nclaims, in the paper under discussion, that even if one \u201closes\u201d\nanargument,itcanbeagoodargumentifonehasmadecogni-\ntive gains. And his dissatisfaction with the problem of missed\n202MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN opportunitiesseemstostemfromthebeliefthatpositive,pro-\nductive critical engagement is desirable epistemologically.\nInourview,theproblemwhichtroublesCohenisrootedin\na tension between these two perspectives. On the one hand,\ntheepistemologicalgoalforargumentationwhichheproposes\n\u2014 the bettering of our cognitive systems \u2014 necessitates that\narguers are colleagues and partners in the enterprise. On the\nother hand, the dialectical roles of arguers, which are\ngrounded in an adversarial paradigm, preclude such a con-\nstructive critical partnership.\n8. A NON-ADVERSARIAL ACCOUNT\nIn our view, the resolution to this tension lies in accepting\nthe epistemological perspective as fundamental and viewing\nargumentation in its various dialectical instantiations as\ninstances of trying to \u201cbetter our cognitive systems\u201d (or what\nwe have called inquiry) (Bailin and Battersby 2009, 2016).\nItistruethatarguersmayhavevariousintentionswhenthey\nbegin,fromthegenuinedesiretoresolveapuzzlementordis-\npute to the wish to persuade their interlocutor without any\nintention to co-operate. We would argue, however, that such\nintentions are irrelevant epistemologically. Van Radziwesky\n(2013) makes a distinction that is helpful in this regard:\n[T]hegoalsomeonemighthavewhilearguingisnotthesameas\nthe good or goal of argumentation as a whole: One is the good\nthat the arguer expects for himself in one instance of argumen-\ntation,theotheriswhatweexpectfromargumentationasaphe-\nnomenon altogether (p.3).\nThe goal of argumentation is to better our cognitive sys-\ntems, or in our terms, to inquire in order to reach a reasoned\njudgment. Even in cases of rational persuasion, there is an\nepistemologicalobligationonarguerstoinquireintotheissue\nunder discussion before trying to persuade someone else of\na position, as \u201conly then have you satisfied yourself (at least)\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 203 about the strength of the grounds for its correctness\u201d (Blair\n2012, p.78). In addition, the various normative constraints on\narguers in conducting rational arguments (e.g., van Eemeren\nand Grootendorst 1983), for example a willingness to modify\none\u2019s position if the arguments warrant or to concede to the\nstrongest argument, require that claims be put to the test of\nreason and that those which are to be accepted are the ones\nwhich have the strongest warrant. Thus, whatever the initial\nintentions of the participants, provided that they are willing\ntoabidebytherulesofrationalargument,theepistemological\nstructure of the enterprise necessitates inquiry (Bailin 1992,\nBailin and Battersby 2009).\nThere are, however, contexts in which it is possible to win\narguments, or lose them. Obvious examples are courtroom\nargumentation (in the Anglo-American system) and formal\ndebates. Both these contexts are structured in an adversarial\nmannerwith\u201cproponents\u201dand\u201copponents\u201dandtherearefor-\nmally recognized winners and losers (this is the prototypic\ncase of the DAM model). In the courtroom case, however,\nthere is a judge or jury who is charged with making a judg-\nment, and although winning is the goal of the particular pro-\nponentsandopponents,thegoaloftheenterpriseasawholeis\nto come to a reasoned and just decision. In the case of formal\ndebates, the primary goal is to win. The possibility for epis-\ntemic gains is minimal as there is a forced choice between\nopposing positions with no allowance for the recognition and\npossibly incorporation of the strongest aspects of each side.2\nItmightbearguedthatwinningandlosingarealsopossible\nin cases of rational persuasion. In such cases, one of the\narguers may win and the other lose in the sense of being suc-\n2.There are alternative forms of debate which are more conducive to inquiry, for example\nstructured controversy, in which participants argue for both sides of a controversial issue\nand ultimately come up with a balanced view, and U-shaped debates in which participants\nare encouraged to physically change their position around a semicircle as they hear reasons\nfrom their peers that cause them to want to shift their view on the issue under discussion\n(see Bailin and Battersby 2015).\n204MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN cessful or unsuccessful at persuading (Aberdein 2015). The\nfirst point to note, however, is that defeating someone in an\nargument may silence them, but it does not necessarily per-\nsuade them. But even in cases when the interlocutor or audi-\nenceispersuaded(ornot),thesearenotreallycasesofwinning\n(or losing) when viewed from an epistemological perspective.\nAberdein\u2019s distinction between real and mere winners and\nlosers is helpful in this regard:\n[T]herearetwosortsofloser:reallosers,wholosetheargument\ndeservedly, because they are in the wrong, and mere losers, who\nlose the argument undeservedly, because they are in the right.\nHencetheremustalsobetwosortsofwinner:realwinners,who\nwin the argument deservedly, because they are in the right, and\nmerewinners,whowintheargumentundeservedly,becausethey\nare in the wrong (p.2).\nEven if one does not accept Aberdein\u2019s framing of the issue\nintermsofarguersbeingrightandwrongandinsteadtalksof\narguers being rightly or wrongly persuaded, his distinction is\nstilluseful.Inthecaseofmerewinners,thatis,whentheaudi-\nenceiswronglypersuaded(unjustifiablypersuaded),nooneis\nawinnerepistemologically.Inthecaseofrealwinners,thatis,\nwhen the audience is rightly, or justifiably persuaded, every-\none is a winner epistemologically in that all participants have\nundergoneanimprovementtotheircognitivesystems,includ-\ning those who have changed their minds. Rooney makes this\npoint with respect to cases in which one comes to accept the\ninterlocutor\u2019s position:\n[W]earenowveryclosetoanadditionalstep...whichinvolves\naclaimwealsoreadilymakeintheeventthat,afterourexchange\nof evidence and reasoning, I end up agreeing with your not-X.\nI lose the argument and you win . . . But surely I am the one\nwhohasmadetheepistemicgain,howeversmall.Ihavereplaced\na probably false belief with a probably true one, and you have\nmade no such gain (though, of course, you might claim some\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 205 achievementandsatisfactioninhelpingmetomyepistemicgain)\n(Rooney, pp.121-122).\nJohnson makes a similar point:\n[O]nereasonargumentationissuchapowerfulpracticeisthatif\neachpartydoesitsverybest,thenbothsideswillgainasaresult\nof the process (Johnson, p.243).\nThe epistemological perspective also makes sense of\nCohen\u2019sobservationthatarguerscanwalkawayfromanargu-\nmenthavinghadtheirpositionschanged,eitherbywinningor\nlosing or listening and learning, and declare it a good argu-\nment on that account (p.129).\nMuch of the discussion regarding adversariality takes as its\ncontext two person persuasive argumentation. This is a con-\ntext in which the framing in terms of winning and losing is\nmost plausible. The collegial nature of argumentation can be\nseen more clearly with respect to cases of group deliberation,\nwhere the goal of the group is to come up with the best deci-\nsion,andwheretheparticipantshaveaclearindividualandas\nwell as collective interest in making the best judgment.\n9. MISSED OPPORTUNITY AS A FAILURE OF JUDGMENT\nFrom an epistemological perspective, the argumentation\nproject is a collective one: arriving at better justified judg-\nments. Thus, regardless of the division of labour in particular\nargumentative interactions, arguers are essentially\u201ccolleagues\nandpartners\u201dintheproject.Ifargumentationisviewedinthis\nway,theproblemCohenenvisagesisnolongerproblematicas\ntheofferingofargumentsbothforandagainstapositionisan\nintegral aspect of the enterprise.\nIt is important, from an epistemological perspective, that\nthe various dialectical tasks be covered but the responsibility\nfor covering them can be seen to be a collective one. They\nmay be covered in various ways by various participants, and\ninsomecontexts,particularindividualsmaytakeonparticular\n206MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tasks. In group deliberation, for example, it may be useful to\nhave a participant play the role of devil\u2019s advocate to discour-\nagegroupthinkordeferraltotheimplicitgrouphierarchyand\nto ensure that alternative arguments are given due consider-\nation. Although this may appear to be a case of adversarial-\nity, it is really the ideas which are in confrontation. And any\narguer is in a position to offer such criticisms and objections\nas well as to propose arguments, offer supporting arguments,\nrevise arguments, and so on. The process of inquiry can be\nconsidered faulty if any of the aspects are omitted, including\nthe offering of additional arguments in support of one posi-\ntion or another. We have referred to the failure to undertake\na comprehensive examination of the various competing argu-\nments as a failure of judgment:\nSincereachingareasonedjudgmentinvolvesacomparativeeval-\nuationofthevariousreasonsandargumentsonanissue,thefail-\nuretotakeintoaccountanyofthesignificantargumentsonthe\nissue constitutes a serious defect in a case (Bailin and Battersby\n2016, p.245).\n10. OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO CRITICAL INQUIRY\nIntheend,Cohentriestoresolvehisconundrumbyobserv-\ning that one of the roles all arguers must play, regardless of\nwhatever other roles they have, is that of argument evaluator,\nand that, as such, they all have the obligation to recognize\nmissed opportunities. He further points out, however, that\ntherearesignificantobstaclesforarguerstoovercomeinorder\nto do this, obstacles largely created by the DAM account and\nstemming from the different argumentative roles. For propo-\nnents, the primary obstacle is the difficulty of acknowledg-\ning,andevenspottingweaknessesinone\u2019sownarguments;for\ncritics, the obstacle is their required stance of neutrality and\nnon-interference;foropponents,theobstacleistheinjunction\nagainst helping one\u2019s adversary.\nAlthoughwearenotinagreementwithCohen\u2019sconstrualof\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 207 the issue in terms of roles, we do agree that there are obsta-\ncles to be overcome in arriving at reasoned judgments (Bailin\nand Battersby 2016). We also agree that the DAM account is a\npart of the problem.3 But we would argue that at least part of\nthe solution lies in a more complete rejection of the language\nand assumptions of adversariality. Framing the argumenta-\ntive project in terms of proponents and opponents, however\nthese roles are construed, likely reinforces the tendency for\narguers to see the project as, on the one hand, making a case\nforpositionstheyalreadyholdanddefendingthemagainstany\nproffered objections, and on the other, finding faults in argu-\nments with which they disagree and ignoring any points in\ntheirfavour.Thisframingworksagainstfosteringthehabitsof\nmind or virtues of argumentation.4 With this construal of the\nproject, promoting positive and constructive critical engage-\nment is an uphill battle. If, however, we frame the argumen-\ntative project as inquiry, then considering all sides of an issue\ninafair-mindedwayisintegral totheenterprise andpositive,\nconstructive critical engagement is the name of the game for\nall arguers. With this construal of the project, habits of mind\nor virtues such as open-mindedness, fair-mindedness, and a\nwillingness to follow an argument where it leads can be seen\nas embedded in the practice and required by its epistemic\ngoals(BailinandBattersby2015).Thus,forexample,someone\nexhibiting the virtues of inquiry evaluates opposing views in\na fair and open-minded manner because she understands that\nsuch a weighing is what is called for in order to reach a rea-\nsoned judgment (Bailin and Battersby 2009, 2015).\n11.

INTRODUCTION\nThe question which motivated this paper arose initially in\nthe context of another paper by one of the authors (Bailin\n2006). To supplement her previous analytic work on creativ-\nity, she had begun to investigate arts practices and concep-\ntions of artistic creation in non-Western contexts. The paper\nin question explored the issue of the epistemological benefit\nof such cross-cultural investigation, and argued for the value\nof investigating alternative perspectives from other cultures\nfor improving our beliefs and practices.\nAlthoughthepapermadeageneralclaimregardingtheben-\nefitsofsuchinvestigation,theissuewasexploredlargelyinthe\ncontexts of the arts and of questions regarding ways of life.\nOne of the questions which remained unanswered and which\nis the major focus of this paper is how far this claim can be\nextended. Is there a general epistemological duty to take into\nconsideration alternative perspectives from other cultures in\nall our own deliberations? Are views that are held without\nexposuretoalternativesfromothercultureslesscrediblethan\nthose that have undergone such exposure?\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 213 2. GENERAL BENEFIT OF CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES\nJohnson (2000, 2003, 2007), Missimer (1994) and others\nhave argued that an essential part of critical thinking is the\nconsideration of alternative views \u2014 what Johnson calls the\n\u201cdialectical tier.\u201d This aspect of critical thinking involves the\nappropriate consideration of alternative positions when\ndevelopingandarticulatingone\u2019sownviewortheory.Inareas\nof controversy this is obviously of great significance. By def-\ninition, arguments in areas of controversy involve claims and\nargumentsonboth(ormany)sidesofaquestion.Thatiswhat\ncontroversy is. It is also obvious that coming to a reasonable\npositioninacontroversialcontextmustinvolvetheweighing\n(assessment) of various positions and evidence on all sides.\nIdentifying the weakness of opposing arguments may be as\nimportant a source of support for one\u2019s position as articu-\nlating the strengths of supporting arguments. Consider, for\nexample, argument against capital punishment. Not only can\none object to the barbarity involved in such punishment, or\ntheinevitableinjusticesthatwillresultwhenaninnocentper-\nsonisputtodeath.Onecanalsoquestiontheinconsistencyof\ntheappealtothe\u201ceyeforaneye\u201dprinciplethatisoftenusedto\njustify capital punishment but not for example, in assault.1\nWhether disputes are ethical or factual, the range of alter-\nnative arguments that are considered tends to be established\nhistorically. From capital punishment to the Big Bang, what\ncount as alternative theories and positions is determined by\nthehistoryofthedebate(e.g.,bigbangvs.steadystate)within\ntheWesternethicalorscientifictraditions.Disciplinaryfields\nalso serve to delimit the range of considerations relevant to\na disputed claim. The tradition of beginning scholarly work\nwith a \u201creview of the literature\u201d acknowledges the role that\n1.One of the authors cites the example of the paper by Jerome Cornfield \"Smoking and Lung\nCancer: Recent Evidence and a Discussion of Some Questions\" which basically turned\naround the debate over whether smoking caused cancer. It was primarily directed at refut-\ning the views of those who opposed the claim that smoking caused cancer (Battersby 2007).\n214MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN consideration of alternative views plays in reflective dis-\ncourse. But such a review is usually limited to the literature\ndesignated by the disciple as relevant. Such a limited review\ncanleaveoutcrucialinformationandinsightsfromotherrel-\nevantdisciplines.Typically,economistsreviewonlyeconomic\nliterature and psychologist review only psychological liter-\nature despite the obvious relevance of psychology to much\neconomictheorizing\u2014apointthatisslowingbeingacknowl-\nedged in economics with the emergence of behavioural eco-\nnomics (Camerer 1996).\nItwouldseemafundamentalprincipleofrationalreflection\nthat, ceteris paribus, positions developed and grounded in a\nbroaderknowledgeofaproblemareaarestrongerthanthose\nthatarenarrowlylimited.Whilesuchaprincipleseemsalmost\nplatitudinous, it obscures a deeply complex problem: deter-\nmining the boundaries of reasonable consideration.\nWhile the relevance of psychology to economics may seem\nobvious, the relevance of other historical and cultural per-\nspectives may seem less so. For example, the strange claim\nthat sunspot activity influences the stock market (because of\nits correlation with stock market activity) seems plainly not\nworthy of consideration.2 In this paper we explore the role\nthat broader cultural boundaries should play in delimiting\nthe consideration of alternative points of view. Historically,\nethnocentrism and the confidence resulting from the success\nof Western science have led, implicitly and explicitly, to the\nboundaries of investigation being set at the boundaries of\nWesterncivilization, andfrequentlyattheboundaries ofcur-\nrentresearchwithinlocaldisciplinarytraditions.Whilesucha\n2.In 1843, the amateur astronomer Heinrich Schwabe found that sunspots come and go in a\npredictable 11-year cycle. Ever since that announcement, many have tried to correlate the\nSun's cycle with all sorts of events on Earth - some have even believed the Sun influences\nthe stock market! Although there is no evidence that solar activity affects economic trends,\nby predicting what the Sun will do in the future we can better prepare for the many other\nimpacts solar activity has for life on Earth. http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/\nast22jul99_1.htm accessed Feb. 9, 2007.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 215 limit has practical advantages for scholarly research, it would\nnot appear to have epistemic justification.\n3. ARGUMENTS FOR CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES FROM\nOTHER CULTURES\nVarious cultures have developed sophisticated systems of\nbelief and elaborate practices in their interactions with the\nworld,anditwouldbeethnocentricarrogancetoassumethat\nnone of these has any value and that all knowledge and wis-\ndomresidesinone\u2019sownculture.AsWongpointsout:\u201cWhen\nfacing hard problems it is simply a good strategy to consider\na wide range of enduring, respected ideas bearing on those\nproblems\u201d (Wong 2005, p.12). And surely other cultures are\nanimportantsourceof\u201cenduring,respectedideas.\u201dThusthere\nmay be something to be learned by looking at the kinds of\ntheoretical and practical ideas which have been developed by\nthose in other cultures in order to understand the world and\ndeal with human problems.\nThereappears,then,tobeatleastaprimafaciepresumption\nin favour of considering beliefs and practices from other cul-\ntures in one\u2019s deliberations. It is important to be clear, how-\never,thatthispointisinnowayanendorsementofrelativism.\nWe are not arguing that all the views of other cultures are\nequally acceptable and should be given equal weight. We are\narguing, rather, that if we view different cultures\u2019 beliefs and\npractices as alternative responses tounderstanding the world\nand alternative solutions to human problems, then this pro-\nvides a reason for taking them into consideration as possible\nsources of knowledge. In this regard, Taylor (1994) recom-\nmends as a starting hypothesis with which to approach other\ncultures, the presumption that \u201call human cultures that have\nanimated whole societies over some considerable stretch of\ntime have something important to say to all human beings\u201d\n(p.66). He makes clear, however, that it is a starting presump-\n216MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tion only \u2013 \u201cthe validity of the claim still has to be demon-\nstrated concretely in the actual study of the culture\u201d (p.67).\n4. INCOMMENSURABILITY OBJECTION\nBefore examining in more detail the possible benefits, and\nappropriate limits, of such cross-cultural investigation, it is\nnecessary to deal with a possible objection regarding the fea-\nsibility, indeed the very possibility of the entire enterprise.\nThe essence of this objection is that cultures are incommen-\nsurable,i.e.,thatthereareradicaldifferencesinbasicconcepts\nand modes of inquiry between cultural traditions, and thus\nthere is no possibility of understanding or meaningful com-\nparison and interaction between cultural frameworks. The\nclaim of incommensurability is made with respect to both\nunderstanding and standards.\nIn response to this objection, we would simply echo the\nviewsofthemanytheoristswhoarguethattheradicalincom-\nmensurabilitythesisisuntenable.First,theveryideaofunin-\ntelligibility and incommensurability between cultures has\nbeen successfully challenged by Davidson (1974) and Putnam\n(1981), among others, in their critiques of the idea of a con-\nceptualschemeandofuntranslatability.Whatismore,incom-\nmensurability presupposes that cultures are distinct, unified,\nself-contained, unchanging, and mutually exclusive. A closer\nlook at the nature of cultures reveals, however, that they are,\non the contrary, fragmented, have indefinite boundaries, and\nhaveahistoryofinteraction andchange (Appiah 2006; Bailin\n2006;Benhabib2002;Waldron2000).Thisobservation,along\nwiththefactofcommonhumanbiologyandcommonhuman\nproblems (related to birth, death, disease, obtaining food,\norder, relationships, and education) render highly likely the\nexistence of overlaps, parallels and commonalities among\nhuman experiences across diverse cultures which would pro-\nvide grounds for understanding and comparison.\nSuch human commonalities also render probable at least\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 217 some commonalities and overlaps in standards of evaluation\natsomelevel(therewill,forexample,likelybesomestandards\nrelated to physical well-being, social well-being, effective\nfunctioningofthesociety,andsuccessininteractingwiththe\nworld), although differences may emerge at a more detailed\nlevel of analysis.3 In addition, apparent incommensurabilities\nof standards may sometimes reflect differences of emphasis\nrather than radically different standards. One possibility for\nengaging in comparison when faced with such apparent dif-\nferencesofstandardsliesinmovingtoahigherlevelofanaly-\nsis where commonalities become evident. Taylor (1994) fol-\nlows Gadamer (1975) in referring to this process of dialogue\nor dialectic between frameworks as a \u201cfusion of horizons\u201d.\nIn the process, some of one\u2019s initial standards may be trans-\nformed. This is not, however, a matter of accepting contra-\ndictions nor of eschewing evaluation, but rather of learning\n\u201ctomoveinabroaderhorizon.\u201dEachframeworkorhorizonis\nnecessarilyalwaysopentothepossibilityofcritiqueandrevi-\nsion, as any fallibilist would agree.\nAn example of this process was evident in the recent inter-\nactionsofoneoftheauthorswithbuildersinItaly.Whentheir\nwork was approached with our North American standard of\nefficiency,itfaileddismally.Itquicklybecameclear,however,\nthat there are values which are placed well above efficiency \u2013\nin particular aesthetics and sociability. Any work done must\nbebeautiful,andconsiderationsoftimeandcostpaleincom-\nparison. And the workday must include ample time to social-\nizewithfriendsoveralonglunchandtochatwithclientsand\npassers-byaboutthework,food,andlifeingeneral.Onceour\nauthor managed to let go of her North American obsession\nwithefficiency andtime andtostep back, she came toappre-\nciate the priority of these other values and the role they can\n3.There is, for example, evidence that art objects in a vast array of cultures are valued for the\nskill of their execution, but what precisely constitutes such skilful execution varies from\nculture to culture (Anderson 2004).\n218MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN play in a rich and satisfying life. She had good reasons not\nto completely abandon her valuing of efficiency, but she did\ncometoseethatthereareefficiency/aestheticsandefficiency/\nsociability tradeoffs and that there may also be good reasons\nfor her to relocate herself along those continua.\nItistruethatacross-culturalcomparisonofviewspresents\nchallenges of interpretation. It must be remembered, how-\never, that interpretation is a necessary part of all evaluation,\nand that it is never an algorithmic process. There are partic-\nular pitfalls to avoid in interpreting the views of another cul-\nture, including errors of chauvinism and of romanticism, but\nthe fact that there are errors to be avoided implies that there\nare also less erroneous ways to interpret (Nussbaum 1997).\n5. EXAMPLES\nWeshallproceednowtoexploresomeofthepossibleepis-\ntemic advantages of examining alternative perspectives from\nother cultures by detailing several examples where such\nexamination seems to be of benefit. In a later section, we will\nendeavortoextractsomegeneralprinciplesorconsiderations\nregarding to what extent and under what circumstances such\na consideration is appropriate.\n5.1. Alternative conceptions: Art\nConceptionsconstitutinggeneralizations regardinghuman\npractices must encompass the entire range of practices that\nmayfallwithintheirpurview.Findingpracticeswhicharenot\naccurately captured by these generalizations will challenge\nthese conceptions.\nAs an example, a typical conception of art in Western soci-\neties is in terms of disinterested contemplation \u2013 art is set\napart from life and is made and appreciated for its own sake.\nIn traditional societies, however, the kinds of objects and\npractices which we consider art are very much integrated\ninto daily life, and everyone engages in some form of art-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 219 making. Thus, investigating the arts practices of some tra-\nditional cultures might serve to reveal the limitations of a\nWestern\u201caesthetic\u201dconceptionofartbyrevealingthatitdoes\nnot have universal applicability. One response might be that\ntheaestheticsconceptioncaptureswhatartreallyis,although\npeople in some other cultural contexts may not (yet) appre-\nciate this. What the latter really amount to, however, is the\nmaking of a claim about what art should be in the guise of\ndescribing what it is. Such a normative claim requires justifi-\ncation. If one insisted on maintaining disinterested contem-\nplation as defining of art, then one would have to recognize\nthat one\u2019s conception of art applies only in a contemporary\nWestern context, and to maintain that the activities and arti-\nfacts of these other cultures which look to us like art-mak-\ning and art objects could not constitute art. Alternatively one\ncould alter one\u2019s conception of the nature of art. Looking at\nart phenomena cross culturally can cause one to look crit-\nically at one\u2019s prevailing conceptions, revealing unexamined\nnormative claims, and possibly supplying grounds for revi-\nsionofthoseconceptions,orleastputtingappropriatelimita-\ntionsonthem.4Itmightalsopromptustolookmoreseriously\nat the artistic practices of other cultures, for example seeing\nthe value of the integration of art into various aspects of life,\nengaged in by a large segment of the population.\n5.2. Alternative practices: Aboriginal justice\nHolding our beliefs and practices up against those of other\ncultures may prompt reflection on deeply entrenched\nassumptions of our tradition and serve to demonstrate that\nthereareotherpossibilitiesinsituationswherewehadprevi-\n4.A more culturally inclusive conception of art is exemplified in Richard Anderson\u2019s wide-\nranging cross-cultural study. He suggests the following as common characteristics of art\nacross cultures: it embodies culturally significant meaning; it inspires an emotional reaction\n(but in very few cultures is it a \u201cdisinterested aesthetic response\u201d), and it exhibits skill. He\ndoes point out, however, that how these characteristics are manifested varies greatly from\nculture to culture (Anderson 2004).\n220MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ously considered our own ways \u201cneutral, necessary and nat-\nural.\u201dSuchanawarenessconstitutesacrucialaspectofevalua-\ntion,asitprovidesthebasisforcomparison.Thisrecognition\nmay, in turn, help one \u201cto distinguish, within their own tra-\ndition, what is parochial from what may be commended as a\nnorm for others, what is arbitrary and unjustified from that\nwhich may be justified by reasoned argument\u201d (Nussbaum\n1997,p.32).Whatismore,thetraditionsmayactuallyinteract\nand enrich each other.\nAn example can be found within the realm of the criminal\njustice system. The North American system of courts, trials,\njudgesandjuries,andincarcerationmayseemtoustoprovide\na reasonable (if imperfect) embodiment of the principles of\njustice and fairness through impartiality and due process. An\nalternativepossibilityisembodied,however,innativesystems\nof justice which offer a non-judgmental environment for\nresolving cases of criminal behaviour. They operate through\nsuch means as healing circles which bring young offenders\ntogether with their guardian, victim and community mem-\nbers; mediation; family and group conferencing; circle sen-\ntencing; community work; and restitution. The aims are the\nhealing of the offender and the repairing of the relationships\namongthevictim,theoffender,theirfamiliesandthecommu-\nnity. Looking seriously at native systems of justice may bring\nto the fore the assumptions embedded in our criminal jus-\ntice system regarding justice as fairness, impartiality, retribu-\ntion,deterrence,andthenecessityofanadversarialstructure,\nand offer an alternative for dealing with criminal behaviour\nbased on a concept of restorative justice underpinned by val-\nues of healing, reconciliation and prevention. Such principles\nand practices, although developed specifically in the context\nof First Nations\u2019 cultural values and practices, embody ideas\nwhich may be worthy of consideration in dealing with crim-\ninal behaviour in the larger North American society, dealing\nwithproblemsinherentinourcurrentsystembyofferingpos-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 221 sibilitiesforcrimereduction,rehabilitation,andstrengthened\ncommunities. Whether such benefits do indeed accrue would\nneedtobethesubjectofseriousassessment,aswouldthepos-\nsible problems regarding, for example, the fairness of treat-\nmentwhenthereisnoassuranceofimpartiality.Regardlessof\nthe results of such an assessment, our beliefs about how best\ntodealwithcriminalbehaviourcouldnotbutbestrengthened\nby this comparison.\n5.3. Alternative theories and practices: Traditional Chinese\nmedicine\n5.3.1. Alternative empirical beliefs\nThe beliefs and practices of other cultures may be a source\nofnewideasabouttheworldwhichhavenotbeenconsidered\nseriously because they do not fit into prevalent models of\nunderstanding. Beliefs from other cultures may come in the\nform of observational claims: that certain herbs cure certain\nillnesses orthatacupuncturerelievespain,orinamoretheo-\nretical form,e.g., thatillness canbeexplained bycertain bod-\nilyprocessesbeingoutofbalance.Chinesemedicineseemsto\nprovidebothkindsofclaimsandisaninterestingtestcasefor\nassessing the epistemic value of considering non-normative\nviews from other cultures.\nTaketheherbalremediesusedbytraditionalChinesemedi-\ncine(TCM),asanexample.Ifsomeoftheseherbsareproven,\nafter testing, to have medical benefits, then a stock of new\njustified beliefs will be added to our repertoire. In addition,\nsome of our beliefs about the appropriate origin of medical\nremedies may be challenged. There are a number of reasons\nforinvestigatingatleastsomeherbalremedies:1)Manyherbs\nhaveprovenefficaciousinthetreatmentofailmentsandsome\nhave formed the basis for new drugs. 2) It seems reasonable\nto assume that societies which have survived over a consid-\nerable period of time have had some success in finding effi-\n222MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN cacious treatments. 3) The possibility of their efficacy is not\ncontradictedbyourscientifictheories;and4)Therearestan-\ndards shared between the cultures which are the sources of\nthe remedies and Western cultures as to what counts as suc-\ncess, i.e., improvement in health.\nIt might seem a straightforward matter to assess the truth\nof claims about herbal medicines, but it is not. Herbal reme-\ndies are usually a mixture of potentially active ingredients,\nandinTCM,itisthecombinationwhichisbelievedtoengen-\nder the results. The approach of contemporary western med-\nicine(CWM)toassessingthevalueofsuchtreatmentswould,\nhowever, involve that isolation of one causal agent at a time\nto assess its efficacy. The categorization of disease necessary\nforsuchtestingmayalsoprovedifficulteitherbecausecertain\nsymptomatic categories are different or because the practi-\ntioners of TCM are reluctant to lump together a variety of\npeople with somewhat similar symptoms to create treatment\nandcontrolgroups.ButasThagardpointsout,withsufficient\ngood intention some of the apparent epistemic incommensu-\nrability can probably be addressed (Thagard 2003, pp.14-21).\nPresumably both TCM and contemporary western medicine\n(CWM) have enough of a shared idea of human health and\ncan agree when a particular treatment has achieved the goal\nofreturningsomeonetohealth.Ifthereisprimafacieevidence\nfor the efficacy of a treatment used by TCM (including anec-\ndotalevidencewhichis,afterall,muchofwhatclinicalobser-\nvation consists of), it would seem reasonable to attempt to\ntest such treatments. Of course life is short and funding for\nresearch limited, so some method is required to distinguish\nwhich of the \u201calternative\u201d treatments are worthy of study.\nAcupuncture is a striking example of a remedy developed\nby TCM which is being successfully tested by the assessment\nprocedures of CWM.

Alternative theoretical model: Traditional Chinese medicine\nThe case of acupuncture is similar to the herbal remedy\ncaseinthatitaddsnewpracticalknowledgetoourrepertoire.\nThere seems good reason to investigate its effects because of\nthe sheer weight of anecdotal evidence attesting to its effi-\ncacy, because of the group survival argument cited above,\nand because of largely shared standards for success (e.g., pain\nrelief, alleviation of symptoms). This case differs from many\nothers in one significant respect, however. Its efficacy cannot\nbe readily explained by our current scientific theories. This\ndemonstrates some incompleteness in our theories and puts\npressure on these theories to furnish an explanation. Thus\nlookingseriouslyatacupuncturehasthepotentialbothtoadd\nto our practical knowledge and to test some of our theoreti-\ncalassumptions.Inparticular,thereisthequestionofwhether\nthe theory used by acupuncture practitioners is of any value\nin understanding how the human body works.\n5.3.2.1. What is the theory of traditional Chinese medicine\n(TCM)?\nSimplistically, the Chinese theory of medicine which pro-\nvides the theoretical basis of acupuncture and various herbal\nremediesinvolvesabalancebetweenyinandyang.Thetheory\nofacupuncturehasbeenusefullyandclearlysummarizedina\npaper by Thagard and Zhu (2003).\nDiseases arise when there is disequilibrium of yin and yang\ninside the body. This principle is central to traditional Chi-\n224MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN nese medicine, and its application dominates the diagnosis,\ntreatment and explanation of diseases.

The imbalance of yin and yang can\nbe caused by either exogenous factors, such as climate, trau-\nmatic injuries and parasites, or endogenous factors, such as\nextreme emotional changes (anger, melancholy, anxiety, and\nso on), abnormal diet, intemperance in sexual activities and\nfatigue.\nAcupunctureisaremedyinvolvinganotherconceptusedin\nTCM: Qi a kind of vital force that flows easily in a healthy\nbody.

We may try to translate the reflections of\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 225 TCM into a more modern guise such as a holistic approach\nto health. WCM shares with TCM the view that the body is\na system that has built in stability which constitutes health.\nWhere TCM and WCM tend to differ significantly is with\nrespecttotheemphasisplacedontheexogenouscausesofill-\nness, especially the role of viruses and bacteria. But perhaps\nWCMgivessuchcausestoomuchfocus.5Thetestingmethods\nof WCM have built-in biases to search for microbial causes\nof illness and treatments that can be manufactured and sold.\nNonetheless, both approaches share a recognition that health\ninvolves the internal mechanisms of the body (e.g., the\nimmunesystemoreliminativeprocesses)operatingcorrectly.\nWhile CWM will typically look for a micro agent that is the\ncauseofanillness,thecausesfocusedonbyChinesemedicine\nare often lifestyle issues \u2014 an area of increasing focus in\nCWM.\n5.3.3. Case study: Ulcers\nHowmightthesetwoapproachesbecompared?Letustake\na case study. Recent research in microbiology has established\nthatthebacteria,helicobacterpylori,isthecauseofmostulcers.6\nThe causal role of helicobacter pylori in ulcers was first pos-\ntulated in the early 1980s and subsequent research, in par-\nticular the impressive remedial efficacy of antibiotics in the\ntreatment of ulcers, has led to a rejection of the previous the-\nory that ulcers were caused by excess stomach acid, perhaps\nproducedbystress.Theevidenceinsupportoftheearlieracid\ntheory was that drugs which reduce or neutralize stomach\naciddidreduceulcersandrelievepain.Inaddition,therewas\n5.Evidence-based medicine tends to focuses on external therapeutic interventions that can be\nadministered in double blind randomized control trials.

The current view\nis that the bacteria cause the stomach to produce too much\nacid(soundfamiliar?) whichisthentheproximalcauseofthe\nulcer.

Although\nCWM now knows that once the bacteria is established, it\nneeds to be eradicated, it seems likely that something more\nholistic or systemic might be the distal cause. Just as lifestyle\ndecisions and personality type seem to play a crucial role\nin causing heart disease in certain people, so might lifestyle\nand stress play a major causal factor in the pathogenesis of\nulcers. Having to address the TCM account could enhance\nour assessment of the CWM account or perhaps result in its\nrevision (Lowenstein 1999).\n5.4.

To treat\nthese imbalances, Chinese medicine commonly uses acupuncture, herbal medicine, and\nmoxibustion. When applied properly, these modalities balance Yin and Yang, harmonize Chi\nand Blood, nourish the organs, and eliminate Damp Heat. http://www.tcmpage.com/\nhpgastrointest.html accessed February 19, 2007.\n228MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN at his shrine up to the United temple at the lake, have yearly\nmeetings in which the high priests assign times of irrigation\nwaterreleasetoeachsharingvillage.Thetimingoftherelease\nofthesacredwatersnaturallyinfluencesdatesofplanting,the\nvarietyofricethatisplanted,thetimingoftheharvestandthe\nscheduling of fallow fields or alternative crops.\nThe system is also characterized by a variety of planting\nmethods including rotation of crops which both protect the\nfertility of the soil and provide pest control. In 1965, the fall\nof Sukarno and the recent breakthrough in the development\nof genetically modified rice provided the rationale for intro-\nducing a new approach into the Balinese agriculture system.\nSuzuki observes that:\nThepractitionersoftheGreenRevolutionworkedthen(andstill\ndonow)underthereductionistassumptionthatagricultureisa\npurely technical process, and that production can be optimized\nwhen everyone simply plants high yielding varieties as often as\npossible. Problems of the soil fertility and pests can be handled\nwith petrochemical inputs\u2026 (Suzuki, p.165).\nFarmers were encouraged to abandon the traditional crop-\npingpatternsandplanthighyieldingvarietiesasoftenaspos-\nsible. Problems immediately emerged. As the water priests\nlost control over both irrigation and cropping patterns, there\nwas soon chaos in the water scheduling and an explosion of\npests.

Project\nexperience highlights the fact that the irrigated rice terraces of\nBaliformacomplexartificialeco-systemwhichhasbeenrecog-\nnized locally over centuries (Suzuki, p.168).\nThe danger is, as the clich\u00e9 has it, throwing the baby out\nwith the bath water. Traditional views about physical, mental\nand environmental health typically have a religious and spir-\nitual theoretical basis. But as the Balinese example shows, it\nis likely that many of these approaches survive because they\nproduce real, tangible benefits. The limitations of these theo-\nries, in particular the lack of micro mechanisms that fit with\nthe western scientific theory, may obscure the more systemic\nperceptionsthattheyembody.Abeliefintheinterconnected-\nnessofthingscanbebasedonclaimsofmysticalunity,orcan\nbe the result of study of systemic interrelationships modelled\nbycomputers.Thelatterapproachmaybeontologicallymore\nsophisticated, but the more spiritual approach may still pro-\nvide practical insights.\nThe benefit from evaluating competing theories from very\n230MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN different cultures probably depends on the willingness of the\ninvestigator to extract from the competing theory as much\nwisdom as possible. An arrogant dismissal, based on the the-\nory\u2019s incompatibility with contemporary western science\u2019s\nemphasis on micro processes explaining macro events runs\nthe risk of ignoring the benefit of looking at the value of a\nmore systemic and holistic account.8 Of course some criteria\nfor ascertaining of prima facie value must be employed in the\nallocation of research effort and expense. The careful and\nrespectful consideration of alternative views demonstrated\nby the NIH has advantages from the epistemic, political, and\nmedical points of view. The current interest in alternative\nmedicine has many sources: from desperation for treatment\nin the cases where CWM is unable to provide a cure to the\nsuspicion thatthereductionist modelofmicro-causation and\ntreatment ofillness has significant limitations as anapproach\ntohealthcare.Giventhisintellectualclimate,anopenminded\nand fair consideration of alternative theories is intellectually\nand politically required.

But\nin either case, the suspicion of bias, narrow-mindedness and\ntoolimitedaparadigmwillhavebeenaddressed,addingcred-\nibility to all validated theories. It does not seem epistemically\njustified to presume a priori that the explanatory paradigm of\nCWM is the only model worthy of consideration.\n6.

We have been arguing that\nthe boundaries of relevance should not be co-extensive with\nthe boundaries of the discipline in question, nor should they\nbe co-extensive with the boundaries of the cultures. Yet it\nis clear that, given constraints of time and resources, it is\nnotpossibletoconsiderallalternativesequallyseriously.Nor\nwould it be useful to do so. Some perspectives appear to be\nsofaroutsidetherealmofplausibilityastonotbeviablecan-\ndidates for consideration. Yet one would still need to know\nenoughabouttheviewtoknowthatitdoesnotmeritfurther\nconsideration. In addition, in ruling out some perspectives a\npriori, there exists the danger of leaving certain of our own\ntheoretical assumptions unquestioned and thus perpetuating\nprevailing ethnocentric biases.\nAretheresome general principleswhichmight beuseful in\nattemptingtodelineatetheappropriaterealmforseriouscon-\nsideration?\nFirst, there do seem to be some differences with respect to\nrealms of inquiry. The strongest (least controversial) general\narguments for the necessity of considering alternatives from\nother cultures appear to be in those areas dealing with val-\nues and ways of life. Although western cultures have devel-\noped powerful scientific tools which have facilitated signifi-\ncant advances in knowledge about the physical world, there\ndoes not seem to be a similar justification for assuming that\ntheir views and practices regarding ways to live need inspire\nthe same degree of confidence. Indeed, given that scientific\nmodels tend to focus our thinking in certain directions (e.g.,\ntoward mechanistic-reductionist explanations), \u201cwe may be\nabletolearnsomethingaboutvaluesfromsocietieswheresci-\nence is less deeply implanted than ours\u201d (Appiah 2006, p.43).\nGiven the commonalities of the human situation, it is likely\nthattheperspectivesofotherculturesinareassuchasthearts,\nsocial institutions and practices, family structure, or social\n232MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN attitudes(forexampleattitudestowardstheoldermembersof\nthe society) can serve to throw into relief our own assump-\ntions and be a source of viable alternative possibilities.\nIt may initially be tempting to think that the requirement\nof considering alternatives from other cultures is limited to\nthese normative spheres but does not apply in the natural\nsciences given the fact that western science has shown itself\nto be vastly superior to other methodologies of investigation\nin terms of understanding the physical world. Certainly, our\nconfidenceinthetheoriesandfindingsofsciencearejustified\ntoasignificantdegree.Thewell-establishedprinciplesofcon-\nfirmation of western science, along with a store of well-con-\nfirmed findings, and its superior resources for investigation\n(including both methods and tools) have provided significant\nadvantages in empirical investigation (e.g., the prohibition\nagainst dissection andautopsies inChina meant thatChinese\nmedical theories had to be developed without the aid of sig-\nnificantanatomicalknowledge).Wewouldcertainlynotargue\nfor giving equal consideration to non-scientific theories in\nexplaining empirical phenomena.\nWe have argued, nonetheless, that the consideration of\nalternatives from other cultures is also important in science,\nas our examples have demonstrated. The reductionist model\nofwesternscience,althoughexceedinglypowerful,canalsobe\nlimitinginsomecircumstances.Anexampleisthebiasagainst\nnon-mechanistic explanations exhibited in the field of med-\nicalscience,forexampleareluctancetocountenancepsycho-\nlogicalorsystemicexplanations,asdemonstratedintheulcers\nexample.9 It appears, then, that the line between science and\nnon-science or between the empirical and the normative is\nnot the appropriate way to think about how to delimit those\n9.Atwood, for example, says the following with respect to the public\u2019s perception of the cause\nof ulcers even after the discovery of the hpp bacterium: \u201cIronically, 60 percent of the general\npublic still thought that the cause was \u2018stress,\u2019 a vague, whimsical, and mildly insulting\n\u2018mind-body\u2019 hypothesis that medicine hadn\u2019t taken seriously for at least a generation.\" Ironi-\ncally, stress is now being reconsidered as a causative factor in ulcers!\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 233 cases where consideration of certain cross-cultural alterna-\ntivesisappropriate.What,then,aresomeofthefactorswhich\ndetermine whether an alternative claim or view is worthy of\nserious consideration?\nOne obvious factor is the availability of empirical evidence\nfor the claim or the view, even if it is only anecdotal. In the\ncase of acupuncture, for example, it seems to have been the\nprima facia support given by its apparent practical efficacy\nwhichpromptedfurtherinvestigation,andjustifiablyso.Such\ninvestigation is least problematic when the claim can be\naccommodated within our current scientific theories, or at\nleast is not contradicted by them, as is the case with claims\nregarding the efficacy of herbal remedies as described above.\nThere seems to be good reason to consider these claims seri-\nously especially since the possibility of their efficacy is not\nprecluded by our scientific theories. Moreover, they are, in\nprinciple, testable (although there are challenges in testing\nthem, as we have seen). Another factor which could affect\nthe strength of the evidence of efficacy is the length of time\nwe have had to test a particular theory. We would have good\nreason to reject theories which have undergone testing over\na significant period of time and have still not demonstrated\npractical efficacy. We might want to be more cautious about\nrejecting theories which are newer to our culture and have\nnothadtheopportunitytodemonstratetheirefficacy(orlack\nthereof).\nThesituationismorecomplexwithrespecttoclaimswhich\nare not supported by or explicable in terms of our scientific\ntheories,asisthecasewithacupuncture.Theweightofanec-\ndotalevidenceseemstoprovidereasontotakeclaimsregard-\ning its efficacy seriously, but the fact of its not conforming\nto our models and not being explainable by our theories has\nprovided reasons historically for its not being considered as\na serious alternative. The lack of accord with the theoretical\nstructureofCWMandthelackofsubstantiation foritstheo-\n234MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN retical claims means that there is no requirement to seriously\nconsiderthetheoryonwhichacupunctureisbased.Nonethe-\nless, the empirical claims regarding its efficacy might still be\njustified. And if the efficacy of acupuncture is confirmed (as\nseems to be the case at least in some instances), then this fact\nwould exert pressure on the theories of CWM to explain the\nfact. Thus there may also be some gains at the theoretical\nlevel, a possibility supported by the consensus panel of the\nNIH in its statement that the discovery of the mechanisms\nwhichprovideawesternscientificexplanationforsomeofthe\neffectsofacupuncturemayprovidenovelinsightsintoneural,\nendocrine and other physiological processes (NIH 1997). In\naddition,althoughtheremaybegroundsforrejectingthethe-\noretical underpinnings of certain views, there may be some\nepistemic merit in their approach to explanation. For exam-\nple, while there may be no grounding for some theoretical\nconstructs of TCM such as chakras and qi, we may be able\nto learn something from their non-reductionist approach to\nexplanationsandmoreholisticorientationtohealthandwell-\nbeing.\nThus a blanket dismissal of claims and views which do not\naccord with our theories does not seem justified as this may\nprevent us from investigating potentially viable alternatives\nand allow us to avoid possible productive challenges to some\naspects of our theory. Yet does this leave us in the position of\nrecommending the serious consideration of a theory such as\nastrology? It might be instructive at this point, then, to see if\ntherearesomegeneralconsiderationswhichmightbeoffered\ninhelpingtodeterminewhichalternativeviewsareworthyof\nconsideration, and to compare astrology and acupuncture as\ntest cases using these principles.\nOne consideration is apparent efficacy, as discussed in\ndetailabove.Astrologyhasdemonstrated noevidence ofeffi-\ncacy despite the fact that its generalizations regarding per-\nsonality and its predictions of the future have been subjected\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 235 to considerable examination over a long period of time. It\ncontinues to be very popular nonetheless, but apparent prac-\ntical efficacy must be distinguished from mere popularity.\nAcupuncture,ontheotherhand,hasshownapparentpractical\nefficacy, and is currently being subjected to rigorous testing\nwhich is showing positive results in some contexts. Not only\ndoes astrology lack evidence of efficacy, its acceptance would\nrequireavirtuallyunthinkablerevisionofthescientificworld\nview (e.g., abandoning the inverse square law). This may be\ncomparedwithacupuncture,which,whileprobablyrequiring\nsome change in our account of pain and nausea would not\npresumablyrequiresubstantialanddeeprevisionofthescien-\ntific outlook.\nIt is important to make clear that our discussion of the\ndesirability of considering alternatives from other cultures\nis directed, in general, at the level of the discipline. We are\nnot suggesting that it is incumbent upon each individual\nresearchertoseekoutalternativesfromotherculturesinallof\nhisorherindividualinvestigations.Wearesuggesting,rather,\nthat it should be a part of the epistemic responsibility of par-\nticulardisciplinestoincludeaconsiderationofcrediblealter-\nnatives in the ambit of its disciplinary investigations. Thus,\nwhile it is not necessary that every researcher dealing with\npain investigate acupuncture, such investigation should be\ntakingplacesomewherewithinthefield(asindeedisthecase).\nOur last factor for delimiting consideration of alternative\nviews is the historical situation. The duty of disciplines to\nconsider views of other cultures is partly based on the role\nsuch disciplines play in the generation of the shared under-\nstanding within society. Alternative views that have consid-\nerable following outside the discipline deserve attention\nbecause of the role that disciplines play in promoting public\nunderstanding.Attentiontothe\u201cdialecticaltier\u201drequiresthat\ncompeting views that are seen as credible in the culture be\ngiven consideration and evaluation.

What counts as a relevant alternative view is usually\ndetermined by historical and social context both within and\noutside the academic or scientific community.

It should be remembered that\nscientific claims, while resting on evidence, still depend on\narguments, viz., arguments for the best explanation.

INTRODUCTION\nThis paper examines the role of the dialectical context in\nscientific reasoning. In our textbook, Reason in the Balance:\nAn Inquiry Approach to Critical Thinking (Bailin and Battersby\n2016), we have introduced a dialectical approach to fostering\ncritical inquiry, centered on a comparative evaluation of rea-\nsons and arguments. This type of evaluation requires knowl-\nedgeofthedialecticalcontextsurroundinganissue.Weargue\nhere for the salient role of this dialectical aspect in scientific\nreasoning and its central importance in science education.\n2. INQUIRY AS DIALECTICAL\nWe have argued elsewhere (Bailin and Battersby 2009,\n2016) for the centrality of critical inquiry for learning rea-\nsoning in a variety of areas. By critical inquiry we mean the\nenterprise of coming to a reasoned judgment on an issue or\nquestion. Coming to a reasoned judgment is at the heart of\nthe kind of reasoning which takes place in a variety of con-\ntexts,disciplinaryaswellaseveryday.Inourbookwedemon-\nstratehowtheprocessofcriticalinquiryismanifestedinsuch\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 241 diverse areas as the social sciences, philosophy, and the arts,\nand, of course, in science.\nAn important aspect of critical inquiry is that it is essen-\ntially a dialectical enterprise (Bailin and Battersby 2009,\n2010). This means that it takes place in the context of some\ndebate or disagreement and that there is a diversity of views\nontheissueinquestion.Italsomeansthatthereisaninterac-\ntion between arguers and between arguments involving crit-\nicisms, objections, responses, and frequently revisions to ini-\ntial positions. An implication of this view is that it is seldom\nthecasethatreasonsandargumentscanbeevaluatedindivid-\nually, other than in a preliminary, prima facie manner (Bailin\nand Battersby 2016). Rather, they must be evaluated in the\ncontext of this dialectic. In order to reach a reasoned judg-\nment, arguments need to be evaluated comparatively, in light\nof alternatives and competing arguments and views (Bailin\nand Battersby 2009, 2016).\n3. DIALECTICAL CONTEXT\nThis type of evaluation of arguments and views in light of\nalternative arguments and competing views requires knowl-\nedge of the dialectical context. Dialectical context is a term\nwhichrefers tothevarious aspects ofthedebate surrounding\nan issue. The primary of these is constituted by the details of\nthe current debate, which Johnson refers to as the dialecti-\ncalenvironment(Johnson2007).Thedialecticalenvironment,\nwhich he defines as \u201cthe dialectical material that congregates\naroundanissue,\u201discomposedofthevariousarguments,objec-\ntions and criticisms, responses to the objections, counterar-\ngumentsandalternativearguments andpositions whichhave\nbeenputforwardregardingtheissue.Inordertoreacharea-\nsonedjudgment,simplyidentifyingreasonsandargumentsin\nsupport of one\u2019s judgment is generally insufficient. In addi-\ntion, itisnecessary torespond tocriticisms andobjections to\n242MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN one\u2019spositionandtocomparativelyevaluateitsstrengths(and\nweaknesses) in light of the available alternatives.\nIncluded also in the dialectical context is the history of the\ndebate.Knowledgeofthehistoryoftheargumentationwhich\nhas led to the current debate is important for evaluating the\nvarious positions which are currently contesting for accep-\ntance. This includes knowing which arguments have been\nrejected and why, and why current views are accepted. This\naspect of dialectical context will reveal the nature and\nstrength of the arguments that contending views are up\nagainst. Also, importantly, it will play a role in determining\nwhere the burden of proof lies.\nInadditiontothisdialecticalcontext,thereareseveraladdi-\ntionalaspectsofcontextswhicharerelevanttoreachingarea-\nsonedjudgmentbyplayingaroleinthedeterminationofboth\nthe significance and the weight of reasons. These include the\nintellectual,social,political,andhistoricalcontexts.Thecom-\nbination of social and political forces at work at a particular\ntime may affect debates by bringing certain issues to salience\nandbyexertingpressureinsupportoforinoppositiontocer-\ntain positions.\n4. ARGUMENT TO THE BEST EXPLANATION\nThis dialectical aspect is particularly evident in the form\nof argument which is predominant in science \u2013 argument\nto the best explanation. Scientific reasoning goes beyond the\npresentation of the evidence and arguments which support\na theory. It includes, as well, and importantly, an attempt to\nshow that the proffered theory offers a better explanation\nfor the phenomenon under investigation than competing or\nalternative theories. We use the term \u201cargument to the best\nexplanation\u201d rather than \u201cinference to the best explanation\u201d\nin order to underscore this dialectical dimension. Inference\nimplies a direct move from reasons (or premises) to conclu-\nsion,whereasitisourviewthatthistypeofscientificreason-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 243 ing involves the making of arguments which must be evalu-\nated in a context and in comparison with alternatives.\nGiventhecomparativedimensionofthistypeofreasoning,\nit is clear that the history and the state of the controversy in\nwhich a scientific theory is put forward play a crucial role in\nthe evaluation of the theory. It is, for example, only possible\nto understand the ascendancy of a current scientific theory\nbyknowing whatother theories they defeated andwhy.Only\nin this way is it possible to understand why the dominant\ntheory is seen as the best explanation and what issues still\nremain contested. In addition, the current standing of a the-\nory or claim determines the initial burden of proof of a new\nor counter claim. Without knowing the history of a scientific\ninquiry,onecannotmakeareasonable assessment ofthenew\nclaim.\nOther types of contexts, including the intellectual, social,\nand political contexts, also often assert an influence on the\nevaluation ofscientific theories, as is evident in several ofthe\nexamples below.\n5. EXAMPLES FROM THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE1\nThe importance of dialectical context is evident when we\nexamineexamplesofscientificreasoning.Wecanseehowsci-\nentists not only offer the observations and evidence in sup-\nportoftheirtheory,butalsohowtheyaddressobjectionsand\ncounter-arguments, both existing and possible, and attempt\nto demonstrate in what ways their theory provides a better\nexplanation of the phenomenon they are investigating than\nexistingorcompetitortheories.Wecanalsoseehowthestate\nof the controversy, the history of the debate, and other con-\ntextual factors play a role in the evaluation of the theories in\nquestion. We present here several examples from the history\nof science which demonstrate the dialectical aspect of scien-\n1. These examples are taken from Bailin and Battersby 2016.\n244MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tific inquiry and could be used with students to illustrate the\nrole of dialectical context in scientific reasoning.\n5.1. Galileo\u2019sDialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\nThe first is an example from Galileo\u2019s Dialogue Concerning\ntheTwoChiefWorldSystems.Inthisexcerpt,Salviati(represent-\ning Galileo\u2019s position) argues that the existence of sun spots\nconstitutes evidence that heavenly bodies can change, while\nSimplicius calls on the authority of Aristotelian teaching that\nthe heavens are unchanging.\nSimplicius:Totellthetruth,Ihavenotmadesuchlong\nand careful observations [of sun spots] that I can qual-\nify as an authority on the facts of this matter; but cer-\ntainlyIwishtodoso,andthentoseewhetherIcanonce\nmoresucceed inreconciling whatexperience presents to\nus with what Aristotle teaches. For obviously two truths\ncannot contradict one another.\nSalviati: Whenever you wish to reconcile what your\nsensesshowyouwiththesoundestteachingsofAristotle,\nyouwillhavenotroubleatall.DoesnotAristotlesaythat\nbecause of the great distance, celestial matters cannot be\ntreated very definitely?\nSimplicius:He does say so, quite clearly.\nSalviati: Does he not also declare that what sensible\nexperience shows ought to be preferred over any argu-\nment,evenonethatseemstobeextremelywellfounded?\nAnd does he not say this positively and without a bit of\nhesitation?\nSimplicius:He does.\nSalviati: Then of the two propositions, both of them\nAristoteliandoctrines,thesecond\u2014whichsaysitisnec-\nessary to prefer the senses over arguments \u2014 is a more\nsolid and definite doctrine than the other, which holds\nthe heavens to be inalterable. Therefore it is better Aris-\ntotelian philosophy to say \u201cHeaven is alterable because\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 245 my senses tell me so,\u201d than to say, \u201cHeaven is inalterable\nbecause Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning\u201d. Add\nto this that we possess a better basis for reasoning about\ncelestial things than Aristotle did. He admitted such per-\nceptions to be very difficult for him by reason of the\ndistance from his senses, and conceded that one whose\nsenses could better represent them would be able to phi-\nlosophize about them with more certainty. Now we,\nthanks to the telescope, have brought the heavens thirty\nor forty times closer to us than they were to Aristotle, so\nthat we can discern many things in them that he could\nnot see; among other things these sunspots, which were\nabsolutely invisible to him. Therefore we can treat of\nthe heavens and the sun more confidently than Aristotle\ncould.\nItisofnotethatGalileo(a.k.a.Salviati)doesnotsimplycite\nobservationsoftheexistenceofsunspotsandarguethatthese\nconstitute evidence that heavenly bodies can change. He also\nargues against the Aristotelian doctrine that the heavens are\nnot alterable. He does this, first, by using another of Aristo-\ntle\u2019s doctrines \u2013 that what sensible experience shows ought\nto be preferred over any argument. He further argues that\ncontemporaries could have more confidence in their judg-\nments about the heavens than could Aristotle because of the\ntelescope, supporting this confidence with another of Aris-\ntotle\u2019s pronouncements \u2013 that those whose senses could bet-\nterrepresenttheheavenswouldbeabletophilosophizeabout\nthem with more certainty. For these reasons, Galileo/Salviati\nargues that the alterable heavens view is a better explanation\nfor the existence of sun spots than the unalterable heavens\nview.\nThis dialogue forms part of Galileo\u2019s case for the Coperni-\ncan view that the earth and other planets revolve around the\nsun. In order to make this argument, he had to defend the\nCopernican view against the Aristotelian picture of the uni-\n246MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN verse which was prevalent at the time. Such was the hold of\nthe Aristotelian geocentric cosmology that Galileo, in mak-\ning a case contradicting this view, had to discharge a strong\nburdenofproof.Theburdenofproofwasparticularlystrong\ngiventhepredominantroleofabstractargumentintheorizing\nabout the natural world. Thus Galileo also had to make the\ncase for the crucial role of sensory evidence, a case which we\nsee him making in the excerpt. In addition, strong influences\nfrom the religious context affected the debate. Because of the\nreligious implications attached to the geocentric view, cham-\npioning the heliocentric view was seen as heretical (as is well\nknown,Galileowas,infact,convictedofheresybytheInqui-\nsition).\n5.2. The History of Geology\n5.2.1. Hutton\nThenextseries ofexamplescomefromthehistory ofgeol-\nogy. Hutton\u2019s work in the late 18th century will provide a\nstarting point. Atthe time Huttonbegan his research,biblical\nscholarship had determined that the earth was a mere 6000\nyears old. Hutton developed a very different view based on\nobservation rather than biblical scholarship. Observing that\nthere were two different kinds of rocks on his two farms,\nhe hypothesized that there must be a place where these two\nkinds met. He did, in fact, find horizontal layers of gray shale\npiled on top of vertical layers of red sandstone. In addition,\nhe noted that there were fingers of granite running into the\nsandstone. From these and other observations he concluded\nthe following:\n1. The lower, upturned sandstone layers must have been\ndeposited a long time ago, tilted and then eroded down.\n2. These sandstone layers must then have been covered with\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 247 new layers of sedimentation that had also eroded and\ncreated the upper layers.\n3. The fingers of granite meant that the granite must have\nbeen molten at some time and therefore there must be great\nheat in the earth where this process could occur.\nIn addition, from observation of the current, almost unde-\ntectable rate of erosion and depositing of sand in the oceans,\nhe reasoned that all these processes would involve enormous\namounts of time.\nIn terms of dialectical context, Hutton\u2019s insights about the\nevolution of the earth\u2019s crust and therefore revision of the\nview of the age of the earth had to go up against the accep-\ntance of the Genesis view of the earth\u2019s creation which\nclaimed a much shorter time frame. Hutton\u2019s theory offered\nan explanation for the observed phenomena which the bib-\nlical-based account was unable to explain. Nonetheless, Hut-\nton\u2019s breakthrough required a significant revision of the cur-\nrent understanding of the world. The ease with which such a\nrevision is accepted depends to some extent on the degree to\nwhich the view conflicts with well-established views.\n5.2.2. Wegener\nIn 1912, Wegener proposed a theory of continental drift to\naccount for the apparent fact that the continents such as\nAfricaandSouthAmericaappeartofittogether.Someearlier\ngeologists had speculated that the continents had at one time\nfit together, but what Wegener added to earlier theories was\ntheobservation, supported byconsiderable evidence, thatthe\nrock formations and fossilized plants and animals showed\nappropriate similarities at matching continental margins. His\ntheory was, however, greeted with considerable hostility, as\nthe following comment by Dr. Rollin T. Chamberlin of the\nUniversity of Chicago indicates:\n248MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Wegener\u2019shypothesisingeneralisofthefootloosetype,inthat\nittakesconsiderablelibertywithourglobe,andislessboundby\nrestrictionsortieddownbyawkward,uglyfactsthanmostofits\nrival theories (cited in UCMP).\nA major issue was that Wegener was unable to offer a con-\nvincing mechanism for such continental movement. Because\nhe was unable to give an account or model of how continents\ncould\u201cdrift\u201daroundtheworld,histheorywaslargelyrejected.\nHistheoryexplainedsomeobservations,butwasnotcredited\nbecause it could not be made coherent with what was then\nbelieved about the physical structure of the oceans and con-\ntinents. Since these existing beliefs were well established,\nWegener\u2019s theory bore the burden of proof. It was unable to\ndischarge this burden because it could not offer a plausible\nalternative account of how the continents could move.\n5.2.3. Hess\nThetheoryofcontinentaldriftwasrevivedinthe1960s,led\nbyanAmericangeologist,HarryHess,whoofferedthetheory\nofplatetectonicstoexplainthephenomenon.Thetheorywas\nthat the recently discovered mid oceanic ridges were spread-\ning and that the continents were sitting on plates which were\npropelled by the slowly moving \u201ccurrents\u201d of the underlying\nmantel.\nHess addressed likely objections to his theory by acknowl-\nedgingthatitwasinitiallyspeculative.Inaddition,itwaslack-\ninginconfirmingdata,anditrancontrarytocurrenttheories.\nHe argued for its superiority to existing theories by demon-\nstrating that it did have the virtue of being the most reason-\nable inference from existing knowledge, providing a way to\naccount for Wegener\u2019s observations and an increasing collec-\ntion of anomalies regarding sedimentation, the fossil record,\nand the magnetic orientation of rocks. (There was magnetic\ndataaccumulatingthatshowedthatrockneartheequatorhad\nformed at locations much nearer the poles than their current\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 249 locations.) Since continental movement had been rejected,\nthere was no adequate explanation for these observations.\nHess explicitly argues for his theory as providing a plausible\nexplanation for these unexplained phenomena:\n\u2026mantle convection is considered a radical hypothesis not\nwidely accepted by geologists and geophysicists. If it were\naccepted, a rather reasonable story could be constructed to\ndescribe the evolution of ocean basins and the waters within\nthem.Wholerealmsofpreviouslyunrelatedfactsfallintoareg-\nular pattern, which suggests that close approach to satisfactory\ntheory is being attained (Hess 1962).\nHess\u2019s theory of sea floor spreading was quickly confirmed\nby the discovery of additional data that was supportive of his\ntheory. New measurements of ocean floor changes in mag-\nnetism showed that indeed the ocean floor was moving away\nfrom the oceanic ridges. A U.S. Geological Services article\nabout Hess\u2019s discovery summarizes thus:\nIn1962,Hesswaswellawarethatsolidevidencewasstilllacking\ntotesthishypothesisandtoconvinceamorereceptivebutstill\nscepticalscientificcommunity.ButtheVine-Matthewsexplana-\ntion of magnetic striping of the seafloor a year later and addi-\ntional oceanic exploration during subsequent years ultimately\nprovided the arguments to confirm Hess\u2019 model of seafloor\nspreading. The theory was strengthened further when dating\nstudies showed that the seafloor becomes older with distance\nawayfromtheridgecrests.Finally,improvedseismicdatacon-\nfirmed that oceanic crust was indeed sinking into the trenches,\nfullyprovingHess\u2019hypothesis,whichwasbasedlargelyonintu-\nitive geologic reasoning (U.S. Geological Services).\n6. DIALECTICAL CONTEXT IN SCIENCE EDUCATION\nThehistoryofscienceisrepletewithexamplessuchasthese\nthat could be used to illustrate the dialectical nature of scien-\ntific reasoning. In our book, Reason in the Balance (Bailin and\nBattersby2016),wehavestudentsinquireintohistoricalcases\nsuch as these. This involves laying out the reasons and argu-\n250MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ments offered on various sides of the issue, as well as criti-\ncisms, objections, and responses; investigating the history of\nthe debate; and inquiring into other relevant aspects of con-\ntext.Finally,theylookathowthereasonsandargumentswere\ncomparatively evaluated and the conclusion reached. The\nsame structure can be used for evaluating scientific claims\nin contemporary debates, for example the safety of vaccina-\ntion or the relationship between fat consumption and heart\nattacks.\nThis process gives students a sense of the dynamic and\nevolvingnatureofscientificinquiry.Emphasizingthatscience\nis a dialectical enterprise that involves argument within an\nongoing context of debate is a welcome corrective to the\nwidely held misconceptions among students (and the general\npublic)aboutthenatureofscienceasinvolvingacollectionsof\nfactswhichhavebeenproventobetruebystudiesandexper-\niments. Such a misconception leaves them vulnerable to tak-\ning as \u201cproven fact\u201d the results of every new study reported\nin the media. Correlatively, the discovery that there are con-\nflicting positions with respect toaclaim ortheory mayresult\nin relativism or even scepticism about the possibility of sci-\nentificknowledge.Learningthatscientificinquirytakesplace\nthrough a process of argument to the best explanation\ninvolves an understanding that having competing theories is\nthe norm, but that there are better justified and less well jus-\ntified views and that it is possible to comparatively evaluate\nclaims and arguments. It also highlights the importance of\nseeking alternative views when evaluating claims and theo-\nries, in science and in other areas of inquiry.\nREFERENCES\nBailin, S. and M.

APPLIED EPISTEMOLOGY AND ARGUMENTATION\nThis paper is a further development of the concept of\n\u201capplied epistemology\u201d that I first proposed in a paper in\nInformal Logic (Battersby 1989). After explaining the idea of\nappliedepistemology,thispaperfocusesprimarilyonthesci-\nence of epidemiology and what \u201capplied epistemologists\u201d (n\u00e9\ninformal logicians) can learn from the epistemological prac-\ntices used in epidemiology.

It is not characterized by over-arching\nlaws \u00e0 la Newton, nor does it lend itself to the application\nof the Popperian principle of falsifiability. Because epidemi-\nology is fundamentally a stochastic science, and no experi-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 253 mentissufficientlyconclusivetofalsifyaclaim,falsificationis\nas elusive as proof. Despite that, epidemiology has had enor-\nmous success in contributing to both an understanding and\nan enhancement of human health through the identification\nof the causes of diseases and to the resultant development of\ncrucialpublichealthrecommendations.Butfirstabitofback-\nground on the idea of applied epistemology.\n1.1. Why \u201capplied epistemology\u201d and how does it relate to\nargumentation?\nThe Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy\u2019s definition of\n\u201cinformal logic\u201d is:\n. . . an attempt to develop a logic which can be used to assess,\nanalyse and improve the informal reasoning that occurs in the\ncourse of personal exchange, advertising, political debate, legal\nargument,andinthetypesofsocialcommentaryfoundinnews-\npapers,television,theWorldWideWebandotherformsofmass\nmedia (Groarke).\nI rejected this view of \u201cinformal logic\u201d in the earlier paper\nreferred to and argued that the enterprise was better thought\nof as \u201capplied epistemology,\u201d analogous to applied ethics. The\nterms \u201cinformal logic\u201d tends to anchor1 the study of argu-\nments in formal logic. Such a nomenclature tempts us to use\nmodels of reasoning based on deduction and to potentially\nmisstheactualnatureofmostreasoning.\u201cAppliedepistemol-\nogy,\u201d on the other hand, focuses the discipline towards the\nactual practice of how people come to and should come to\njustified beliefs. On analogy with applied ethics, the study\nof people\u2019s actual epistemological practices can provide both\ninformation and challenges for the theoretician of reasoning.\nApplied ethics has created a robust research project and\n1.The concept of \u201canchoring\u201d is used in psychology to describe the tendency of people to be\nnon-rationally influenced by where ever they start their deliberations. For example, in buy-\ning real estate, the asking price often influences people\u2019s offers independent of the worth of\nthe property.\n254MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN stimulated ethical thinking both inside and outside philoso-\nphy. Studying and theorizing about the epistemological and\nargumentative practices of other disciplines may yield com-\nparable insights. There is no reason for applied epistemology\n(or informal logic)tolimit itself tothe study of popular argu-\nmentsasdescribedintheabovedefinition.\u201cInformal\u201dreason-\ning,argumentation,isthemostimportantreasoninginvirtu-\nally every discipline.

Epidemiology\nWhat is epidemiology? Below are two typical definitions:\nEpidemiology: a branch of medical science that deals with the\nincidence, distribution, and control of disease in a population.\n(Merriam-Webster Online)\nEpidemiology:Epidemiologyisthestudyofthedistributions\nand (causal) determinants of disease in populations. (from the\nDictionary of Epidemiology 62, (John M.

CAUSALITY IN EPIDEMIOLOGY\n2.1. History and the development of criteria\nIt is informative to study the history of epidemiology from\nan epistemological perspective. In the 19th and 20th cen-\nturies,thefieldofepidemiologywentthroughaseriesoffun-\ndamental revisions as to how causal claims should be estab-\nlished. Early epidemiologists, such as the famous John Snow,\nwhose work helped prevent cholera epidemics in mid 19th\ncentury London, did not have models of the causal mecha-\nnismforthespreadofdisease.Becauseofthislack,theywere\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 257 restricted to establishing correlations between exposure and\nillness. For example, Snow identified a correlation between\ncertain water sources and the incidence of the cholera. Lack-\ning a biological theory, early epidemiologist could only spec-\nulate on possible linking causes. Today, epidemiologists uti-\nlize not only statistical methods, but also whatever biological\nmodels areavailable toestablish causal relationships between\ncausal factors and health outcomes: e.g., broccoli leads to\nreducedcancer,bacterialeadtoulcers.Claimsareestablished\nbycombiningthestatisticalresultsofstudiesandresultsfrom\nlaboratory experiments together with the best biological\nknowledge.2 Epidemiologists study not only causes of illness\nbutalsoputativecures.Thestudiesthatconfirmedtheviabil-\nityofthepoliovaccineareonefamousexampleofepidemiol-\nogy in service of preventative medicine.\nMy focus on epidemiology as a paradigmatic science is not\nwithout a somewhat ironic precedent in analytic philosophy.\nCarlHempel,inhisclassicPhilosophyofNaturalScience(1966),\nused an account of the effort of an early epidemiologists,\nIgnatzSemmelweis,tointroducescientificreasoning.Hempel\ndescribes at some length Semmelweis\u2019 efforts to discover the\ncause of a higher incidence of puerperal fever in one of the\ntwo maternity wards in his hospital. As many will recall,\nHempel uses Semmelweis\u2019 story to illustrate how science\noftenproceedsbytrialanderrorandtheeliminationofcom-\npetinghypotheses.Despitebeginningwiththisstory,Hempel\ngoesontotheorizeaboutcausalexplanationslargelywithref-\nerence to reasoning in physics not medical research.\nAsHempelrecords,Semmelweistheorizedthatthecauseof\nhighermortalityfromso-called\u201cpuerperalfever\u201dinoneofthe\ntwo maternity wards was due to \u201ccadaverous matter\u201d on the\n2.Actually, there is still a debate within epidemiological circles over whether to take a \u201cblack\nbox\u201d approach and just crunch number, or to incorporate biological theories. This approach\nis often embodied in the use of terms like \u201crisk factor\u201d which avoids having to make a causal\nclaim\n258MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN hands ofmedical students emerging fromthe nearbyautopsy\nroombeforeexaminingthepregnantwomeninthatward.By\nhaving the students wash their hands, Semmelweis was able\nto reduce the level of mortality in the higher mortality ward\nto a rate comparable to that in the other. Regrettably, there\nstill was a 3% mortality rate in both wards which underlies\nthe complexity of epidemiological causal reasoning: cadaver-\nous matter was neither necessary (3% were infected anyway)\nnor sufficient for the illness (the rate in the ward with higher\nmortality was 9%). And as we all know, it was not only mat-\nterderivedfromcadaversthatcausedtheillness.Semmelweis\nhimself later theorized that it was \u201cputrid\u201d matter because he\nrealized that the illness was being transmitted from the sick,\nnot just the dead.\nOne of the theories that Semmelweis rejected before his\ndiscovery was the theory that puerperal fever was caused by\n\u201ccosmic telluric changes.\u201d This type of causal theory was a\ncommonplaceinearlymedicine\u2014ascribingmanyillnessesto\na general miasma that just affected some people.\nInthelate19thcentury,asthegermtheoryofillnessgained\nacceptance,thismiasmaapproachtoaetiologywasrejectedby\nthe renowned German pathologist, Jakob Henle and his stu-\ndentRobertKoch,whoarticulatedthefollowingrigorouscri-\nteria for a causal claim in medicine:\n\u2022 Theagentshouldbepresentineverycaseofthediseaseunder\nappropriate circumstances.\n\u2022 The agent should not be present in any other disease as a\nfortuitous and nonpathogenic agent.\n\u2022 The agent must be isolated from the body of the diseased\nindividual in pure culture, and it should induce disease anew\nin a susceptible animal (Pai 2005).\nHelpful and rigorous as these criteria were, they later\nrequired extensive revision as the study of disease moved\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 259 fromafocusonpathogenstoafocusonacomplexoffactors.\nThe presupposition of one disease/one pathogen just did not\nfitemergingfactsaboutsuchillnessesascancer.Forexample,\nthe research into smoking that was done in the early 50s\nrevealedastrongassociationbetweensmokingandlungcan-\ncer, but also, a strong association with coronary artery dis-\nease.Criticsofthedayargued,usingtheHenle-Kochcriteria,\nthat this showed that smoking could not be the true cause of\nlung cancer (Stolley, p.65). Rather than accept this criticism,\nresearchers began to develop alternative criteria that would\nform the basis for establishing causal claims about diseases.\nThe 1964 Surgeon General\u2019s Committee on Smoking and\nHealth developed explicit criteria to determine whether\nsmokingcausedthediseasesunderreviewbecauseofthepub-\nlic scrutiny to which their study would be subjected. The list\nincluded (with my comments):\n\u2022 Consistency of findings. Conflict in evidence mitigates against a\ncausal claim.\n\u2022 Strength of association.

There is also a danger that\ntheuseofmathematicswillcreateanappearanceofprecision\nthatismisleading.Eventhecurrentuseofstatisticalinference\nin epidemiological research is often misleading. For example,\nalmost no studies meet the condition of random sampling\nwhich provides the mathematical basis for applying the for-\nmulae. The so-called \u201ccase controlled studies\u201d which play an\nimportant role in epidemiological research consist of match-\ning a group of people who have an illness with a comparable\ngroup of people who don\u2019t have the illness and then looking\nfor factors that are more prevalent among the ill than among\nthe controls.\nObviously, the choice of comparable controls can have a\n264MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN greateffectontheutilityofthecomparison.Yettherearenot\nand cannot be mathematical standards for selecting the con-\ntrols. The controls are selected on assumptions about what\naspects of an individual are crucial for identifying relevant\nsimilarity. The obvious factor of age is almost always taken\nintoaccount,butevengenderandracearefrequentlyignored.\nAnd what else is missing?\nTo see how this works in practice, take the case of early\nstudiesintothesmoking/lungcancerlink.Intheearly1950s,\ntwo retrospective studies of approximately 600 to 700 cases\noflungcancerweredonethatcomparedthehistoryofsmok-\ning among lung cancer victims and \u201ccontrol\u201d groups made\nup of other hospital patients of \u201csimilar\u201d characteristics who\ndid not have lung cancer. The samples of subjects used in\nthis approach are known as \u201csamples of convenience.\u201d Both\nof these early studies found a slightly higher rate of smoking\namongthecancervictimsthanthecontrolgroup,butthedif-\nferences between the rates were not great enough to be sta-\ntistically significant, i.e., the researchers could not be 95%\nconfident that the differences in the rate ofsmoking between\nthe groups was not due to chance. Researchers still believed\nthere was a relationship between smoking and lung cancer,\nalthough their study had failed to \u201cstatistically\u201d demonstrate\nit. Why had the study failed to demonstrate what is, in fact, a\nstrong correlation? With the advantage of hindsight, we can\nclearly see the problem. None of the patients in the \u201ccontrol\ngroup\u201d had lung cancer, but many of them had illnesses to\nwhich we now know smoking contributes (such as heart dis-\nease). The control group was not representative of the non-\nlung cancer population. The controls had a larger percentage\nofsmokersthaninthenon-lungcancerpopulationofcompa-\nrable age. The unrepresentative percentage of smokers in the\ncontrolgroupobscuredtheactuallydramaticdifferenceinthe\nrateoflungcancerbetweensmokersandnon-smokers(Corn-\nfield 1959, p.182).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 265 This is not just a problem in scientific research. While it\nis widely believed that the ideal sample for polls is a \u201crep-\nresentative\u201d sample of the population, pollsters have learned\ntheunreliabilityofsuchsamples.Thefamouspollster,George\nGallop, initially gained great renown in the 1940s when he\nused representative sampling to more or less correctly predict\nthe re-election of Roosevelt. His poll was based on the sam-\npling of some 8000 people, in contrast to the Literary Digest\npollwhichsurveyedmillionsandmadethewrongprediction.\nNonetheless, when Gallop used the same technique for the\nsubsequent Truman election, he predicted the wrong victor\nandhispredictionwasbadlyoff.Subsequentlyhewenttoran-\ndomsamplingnotrepresentativesampling,recognizingthatit\nis not possible to reliably identify the factors that make for a\nrepresentative sample. Gallop\u2019s lesson has not been reflected\ninmostscientificresearchsimplybecausesuchrandomselec-\ntion techniques usually cannot be used in this research. Par-\nticipants in studies are necessarily volunteers who were not\nrandomly selected and many diseases have too low an inci-\ndence to be effectively studied using random selection. My\npoint is not to deride the research, but to re-emphasize that\njudgmentandargument(notprobabilitytheory)mustbeused\ntosupport theclaimthatthesamplesandcontrolgroupsthat\nwere studied provide a reasonable basis for the correlational\nand causal claims being made.\n2.4. Argumentation in epidemiology\nAs argued above, statistical inference is often not adequate\nfor establishing correlations in most studies. It is never ade-\nquate for establishing causal claims. Correlations are neces-\nsary but not sufficient for a causal claim. Epidemiologists\nmust,therefore,useinformalargumentstomaketheircasefor\nacausalclaim.Basically,whatepidemiologistsdoisarguethat\ntheir claim is the best explanation. While the status of \u201cinfer-\nence to the best explanation\u201d as the best account of scientific\n266MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN reasoning remains controversial in philosophy, it seems clear\nthat the argumentative process in epidemiology is best char-\nacterized in this way. The primary objection of philosophers\nto\u201cinferencetothebestexplanation\u201daccountofscientificrea-\nsoningisthatthenotionof\u201cbestexplanation\u201disvagueand/or\ncircular.Butifwetakeanappliedepistemologicalapproachto\nanalyzing the work of epidemiologists, we can see how they\nuse the criteria discussed above to substantiate their positive\nclaims and reject counter theories.\nOne of the most famous and effective examples of what I\nwish to call \u201cargument for the best explanation\u201d was made in\n1959 by Jerome Cornfield and others arguing the case that\nsmoking is the primary cause of lung cancer. This article is\nwidelyconsideredtohaveestablishedthecaseforsmokingas\na cause of lung cancer and led to public policy efforts such as\nthe Surgeon General\u2019s Report cited above.\nIn his summary, Cornfield both argues for his claim and\nrejects alternative hypotheses:\nThe magnitude of the excess lung cancer risk among cigarette\nsmokersissogreatthattheresultcannotbeinterpretedasaris-\ningfromanindirectassociationofcigarettesmokingwithsome\nother agent\u2026 The consistency of all the epidemiological and\nexperimental evidence also supports the conclusion of a causal\nrelationship \u2026while there are serious inconsistencies in rec-\nonciling the evidence with other hypotheses which have been\nadvanced (Cornfield 1959, p.173).\nIn his article, Cornfield first reviews the existing literature\nin support of the causal claim, and then devotes most of the\npapertorespondingtocriticismsofthestudies.Hedividesthe\nresponses into 5 major topics:\n\u2022 population data\n\u2022 retrospective and prospective studies\n\u2022 studies on pathogeneses\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 267 \u2022 other laboratory investigation\n\u2022 interpretation\nIn the first section, he replies to the objection that the sig-\nnificant difference in the rate of lung cancer among men and\nwomen is grounds for discarding the causal hypothesis. He\npoints out that the data shows that men have been smoking\nforsignificantlylongerthanwomen,especiallyintheover55\nage group, which is the demographic that mainly experiences\nlung cancer. In addition, he notes that the rate of lung cancer\namong both male and female non-smokers is similar.\nInasectiononcriticismsofretrospectivestudies,Cornfield\nargues: \u201c . . . for the most part, the specific points of criticism\napply only to some of the studies and not to others\u201d (p.181).\nHe argues for the overall convergence of the research despite\nspecific problems with any particular study.\nIn another section, Cornfield replies to the objection that\nexperiments involving rats exposed to smoke have failed to\ninducelungcancer,asbeing\u201c...trueatthetimeofthisreport,\nalthough it can be questioned whether any animal received\nas large a dose of cigarette smoke through indirect exposure\nas a human being does by voluntary deep inhalation.\u201d He had\nearlier noted the difference in rates of lung cancer among\ninhalers and those that did not inhale.\nCornfield acknowledges that nothing short of randomized\ntrials could provide a clear cut answer to what he calls the\n\u201cconstitutional hypothesis,\u201d the idea that some people are\nprone genetically to both smoke and get lung cancer. Never-\ntheless, he argues this hypothesis is inconsistent with the fol-\nlowing observations:\n1.changesinthelungcancermortalityoverthelasthalf-century,\n2. carcinogenicity of tobacco tars for experimental animals, 3.\neffect of pipe smoking on larynx cancer but not lung cancer, 4.\nreduced lung cancer among discontinued smokers. No one of\nthese considerations is perhaps sufficient by itself to discount\n268MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN the constitutional hypothesis, ad hoc modifications of which\ncan accommodate each additional piece of evidence. A point\nis reached, however, when a continuously modified hypothesis\nbecomes difficult to entertain seriously (Cornfield 1959, p.191).\nLastly,Cornfieldrepliestothewell-knownquestionofwhy\nmany smokers never get lung cancer: \u201cWe have no answer to\nthisquestion.ButneithercanwesaywhymostoftheLubeck\nbabies who were exposed to massive doses of virulent tuber-\ncle bacilli failed to develop tuberculosis [note the argument by\nanalogy].Thisisnotareason,however,fordoubtingthecausal\nrole of the bacilli in the development of the disease\u201d (p.197).\nThe foregoing are only a sample of the arguments that fill\nthe 30-page article. But as can be clearly seen, they involve a\nwide variety of informally presented appeals to science and\ncommonsense.Infact,theonlystatisticalpartofhisresponse\nis placed in an appendix.

Historically, the experimentalist lost the\nsmoking/lung cancer debate, though introductory books on\nexperimental method and statistics (largely written by sta-\ntisticians) still tend to emphasize the former approach (cf.\n4.It should be admitted that my view of the epistemology of epidemiology is not universal in\nthat discipline. In an informative overview of the history of the smoking and lung cancer\ndebate, Mark Passcandola (June 2004) identifies two approaches which he calls the experi-\nmental and the inferential. He contrasts them as follows:\n270MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN thegenerallyexcellentintroductionstatisticsbookbyJessica\nUtts, 2005).\n3. APPLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CAUSAL CRITERIA TO\nOTHER DISCIPLINES\nThe criteria used by epidemiologists to make their argu-\nment that their causal claim is the best explanation may also\nbe used in other disciplines. For example, the debate over the\ncausaleffectsofpornographycontinuesalthoughcurrentlyat\na much lower key than in the late 20th century. This issue,\nlike many of those in epidemiology (such as the causal effect\nof passive smoke) has profound public policy implications.\nThosewhoargueforthenegativeeffectsofpornographyhave\na fairly strong burden of proof as they are up against the\nstrong presumption in favour of free speech.\nArecentreviewoftheresearchbyastudentofmine,Lind-\nsay Johnson, found that such strong evidence was difficult to\nfind and that, in fact, there was some powerful counter-evi-\ndence that suggested another, far more significant causal fac-\ntor. In her study, she cited work by Dodson which makes the\nfollowing claims (I have indicated in italics the various causal\nconsiderations that are implicitly appealed to):\nStudies on violent pornography are inconsistent.

The studies in this area exhibit much more\nconflict and, not surprisingly, a much weaker association\nbetween smoke exposure and lung cancer incidence. The\ncommonly cited risk factor of 1.2 (an average of many stud-\nies\u2019) means that people who are exposed to ETS have an\napproximately 20% higher risk of getting lung cancer than\nthose who are not exposed. This is in contrast to the relative\nrisk of smokers which is between 6-16 times the risk of non-\nsmokers(dependingonamountsmoked).Anadditionalprob-\nlem with ETS research is determining the amount of expo-\nsure.\nTwo recent studies related to ETS illustrate both the dif-\nficulties involved in the research and the problem of evalu-\nating the appearance of bias without descending into the ad\nhominemfallacy.\nAn article by James E. Enstrom and Geoffrey C. Kabat\npublishedintheBritishJournalofMedicine(EnstromandKabat\n2003) caused a storm of protest when it published the fol-\nlowing results from a prospective study of 120,000 Califor-\nnians: \u201cFor participants followed from 1960 until 1998 the\nage adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for never\nsmokers married to ever smokers compared with never\nsmokers married to never smokers was 0.94 (0.85 to 1.05).\u201d\nThatis,theyfailedtofindacorrelationbetweenspousalexpo-\nsure and increased lung cancer rate. Enstrom and Kabat con-\ncluded: \u201cThe results do not support a causal relation between\nenvironmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality,\nalthough they do not rule out a small effect.\u201d\nThe authors admitted in their statement of interests that:\nInrecentyearsJEE(JamesE.Enstrom)hasreceivedfundsorig-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 273 inating from the tobacco industry for his tobacco related epi-\ndemiologicalresearchbecauseithasbeenimpossibleforhimto\nobtain equivalent funds from other sources.

In fact, one of the\nauthors in responding to the accusations argued: \u201cScientists,\nand particularly epidemiologists, who deal with the criteria\nfor judging causality, should be wary of imputing motives\nbased on theflawed logic of guilt by association.\u201d\nWhatevertheflawsinthestudy,itseemsclearthatthesus-\npicion of bias and the role of tobacco funding played a cru-\ncial role in the debate.

A 1998 article also in the British Journal of\nMedicine, by Barnes and Bero entitled \u201cWhy Review Articles\non the Health Effects of Passive Smoking Reach Different\nConclusions\u201d argued that bias was definitely at work in pas-\nsive smoking research.\nAbstract\nTheauthorsreviewedreviewarticlesonthetopicofETCand\nfound that:\nDataSynthesis.Atotalof106reviewswereidentified.Overall,\n37% (39/106) of reviews concluded that passive smoking is\nnot harmful to health; 74% (29/39) of these were written by\nauthorswithtobaccoindustryaffiliations.Inmultiplelogistic\nregressionanalysescontrollingforarticlequality,peerreview\nstatus, article topic, and year of publication, the only factor\nassociatedwithconcludingthatpassivesmokingisnotharm-\nful was whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco\nindustry (odds ratio, 88.4; 95% confidence interval,\n16.4-476.5;P<.001).\nConclusions.

But we should be careful.\nTheclaimoffundingbiasisthatthefundingiscausallyrelated\nto the judgment in the study. But all that the evidence estab-\nlishes is that there is a correlation. We must be careful about\nthe inference to causality, in particular the application of the\ncriteria of temporality. Funding support may follow research\nthathappenstosupportthepositiondesiredbywillingfunder\nrather than researchers being paid to do studies that support\nthe funder\u2019s point of view. This appears, for example, to be\nwhat happened in the passive smoking article cited above.\nHow should readers \u201cconsider the affiliations of the\nauthor\u201d? As the comments by the editor of British Journal of\nMedicine indicate, what to do about corporate funding in sci-\nence is a huge question. Disclosure of financial interests cer-\ntainly seems essential, but clearly such disclosure may result\ninthefallaciousdismissaloflegitimateresearch.Ifyoubelieve\nthat any use of ad hominem observations in an argumentative\ncontextisfallacious(andirrelevant),thenyouwouldnoteven\nrequire that authors cite their funding sources. The reason\nthat ad hominem remarks are often fallacious, as the BJM edi-\ntornotes,isthattheytemptpeopletofaciledismissalwithout\nlooking at the details of the study. On the other hand, the\nproblem with ignoring information about the authors\u2019 fund-\ning support (or even publication record) is that this is clearly\ninformation that can help contextualize (thought not refute)\nan author\u2019s argument. I believe that most informal logicians\nwould support the BJM editor and the article\u2019s authors in\ndiscouraging people from solely basing their judgments of a\nstudy on the basis of an author\u2019s funding sources, but would\n276MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN also support a policy of requiring authors to acknowledge\ntheirfundingsources.Tounderstandthebreadthofthisissue,\nit should be noted that all testing of new drugs is funded by\npharmaceutical companies.\n5.

SUMMARY\nMy general goal in this paper was to encourage informal\nlogicians and others interested in applied epistemology to\nlook at epidemiology as a paradigmatic science crucially\ndependent on argumentation. My two specific goals in this\npaper were: 1. to give an example of applied epistemology by\nlookingatcausalargumentation andjustification inepidemi-\nology, and 2. to show that there could be a symbiotic rela-\ntionship between epidemiology and work in various applied\nreasoning disciplines such as argumentation, informal logic,\nphilosophy of science and \u201capplied epistemology.\u201d\nEpidemiologists are an important example of disciplinary\npractitioners who develop and apply epistemological criteria.\nIhave argued that epidemiologists wouldbenefit fromseeing\nthe justification of a causal claim as making an \u201cargument\nforthebestexplanation\u201dwhichinvolvesnotonlycommonly-\nused criteria for justifying a causal claim, but also considera-\ntion of arguments against alternative explanations. The need\nforapplicationofsomeobviouscriteriabeyondstatisticalsig-\nnificance was illustrated by the example of the supposed\neffects of retroactive prayer, and the application of the argu-\nment for the best explanation was illustrated by the 1959\npaperofJeromeCornfieldonthecausalrelationshipbetween\nsmoking and lung cancer. I also gave an illustration of how\ncausal criteria used in epidemiology might well be useful in\nother stochastic sciences such as sociology and psychology.\nOf additional interest to informal logicians and argumen-\ntation theorist are the dialogic problems that appear peri-\nodically in epidemiological discussions around controversial\nissues such as the effects of passive smoking. The common\nof use of the ad hominem fallacy in these debates represents a\nshared concern for both informal logicians and epidemiolo-\n282MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN gists. The appropriate assessment of bias and its relationship\ntoargumentevaluationisatopiconwhichinformallogicians\nshould be able to make significant contributions once they\ntake into account the complex role that funding plays in such\nsciences as epidemiology.\nEpidemiology is a rich source of examples for all applied\nphilosophy, but especially applied epistemology. My hope is\nthat this paper will help encourage others to expand their\nintellectual interests beyond a \u201cone-sided diet\u201d of examples\nfrom newspaper editorials or deductivist sciences such as\nphysics.\nREFERENCES\nAbruzzi,W.S.2005.HillsCriteriaofCausation.Retrievedfrom\nhttp://www.drabruzzi.com/hills_criteria_of_causa-\ntion.htm April 21.\nBarnes,D.E.andL.A.Bero.1998.\u201cWhyReviewArticlesonthe\nHealthEffectsofPassiveSmokingReachDifferentConclu-\nsions.\u201dJAMA279:1566-1570.\nBattersby, M. 1989. \u201cCritical Thinking as Applied Epistemol-\nogy: Relocating Critical Thinking in the Philosophical\nLandscape.\u201dInformal Logic11, 2: 91 \u2013 100.\nCornfield, J., et al. 1959. \u201cSmoking and Lung Cancer: Recent\nEvidence and a Discussion of Some Questions.\u201d Journal of\nthe National Cancer Institute22: 173-203.\nEnstrom, J.E. and G.C.

TEACHING\n286MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN CHAPTER 16\nTHE COMPETENT LAYPERSON: RE-ENVISIONING THE\nIDEAL OF THE EDUCATED PERSON\nMark Battersby\n1. INTRODUCTION: AN EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS STORY\nThe doctor has told you that you have lung cancer and\nbecauseyouhaveanumberofdifferentsitesinyourlung,the\ncancer has clearly metastasized. An operation would be use-\nless, chemotherapy a painful and futile palliative. You proba-\nbly have only a few months to live. Do you accept the doctor\u2019s\nopinionandgohomeanddie?Ordoyoutakeanintelligent interest\nin your problem? Did your education give you the confidence and\nskills to take such an interest?\nThis is a very real question. Such a diagnosis was given to\nmysister-in-lawin1995.Fortunatelyshedidnotjustgohome\nand give up. My sister-in-law, a good friend of hers, my wife\nandmyselfsetaboutlearningaboutlungcancerandaboutthe\nproblems of diagnosis.\nFor years, I have used Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s wonderful Dis-\ncoverarticle(Gould1985) onmedicalprognosis inmycritical\nthinking classes and I immediately gave her a copy. Gould\nmakes the point that whatever the \u201caverage\u201d life expectancy\nof a given diagnosis, there are always outliers \u2014 individuals\nwho dramatically exceed the average \u2014 lying practically off\nthe curve. Youth, general health, availability of excellent care,\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 287 a positive attitude, and even misdiagnosis may all contribute\nto the possibility that one is among the \u201coutliers\u201d. Reasonable\nskepticism can be a source of hope.\nMy sister-in-law quickly transferred to a government can-\ncer clinic, leaving the hospital where the initial diagnosis was\ndone and where two different doctors had given her a death\nsentence. In the local cancer clinic, doctors work together in\nteams and, to some extent, encourage patient involvement.\nWeimmediatelywenttotheclinic\u2019slibraryandreceivedcon-\nsiderable help from the librarian. The team of doctors raised\nsome questions about the initial pathologists\u2019 report. What\ntype of cancer cell was involved? Were the sites independent\norlinkedtooneanother?Furthertestingwasrequired.Butat\ntheendoftheseinquiriesitremainedtheopinionoftheteam\nand particularly the clinic\u2019s pathologist that the cancer sites\ninvolved identical (metastasized) cells.\nThrough this diagnostic process we learned that the judge-\nment of whether the cancer had metastasized was based on\njudgementsofvisualsimilarity.Thereappearedtobeno\u201cgold\nstandard\u201d\u2015no clear means to check the reliability of the\npathologist\u2019s judgements. In addition, we learned that lung\ncancer with multiple sites in the lung was quite exceptional.\nNoonewassurethatsuchadiagnosticappearancemeantthat\nthe cancer had metastasized.\nUsing cancer textbooks, Medline, and an article in the Sci-\nentific American, we came to the conclusion that the initial\ndiagnosis was not well validated. We noted that the patholo-\ngistsdisagreedaboutthecelltype,thoughthenewpathologist\nassured me he was \u201c90% certain\u201d that the cells were identi-\ncal and hence had the same source. But knowing there was\nno\u201cgoldstandard,\u201dIwasawarethatthis\u201c90%\u201dfigurewasjust\na subjective assessment of confidence and not a real measure\nof reliability. Based on my wife\u2019s reading about DNA testing\nin a colon and brain cancer study in the Scientific American,\nwe asked why DNA testing wasn\u2019t being done in this case.\n288MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Forreasonsstillunclear,thedoctorsatthecanceragencyhad\nnot used such procedures in lung cancer cases. They now do.\nWhen they used DNA testing on my sister-in-law\u2019s lungs, it\nbecame clear (to the amazement of the pathologist) that the\nseparate sites were not from the same source, but indepen-\ndent.Thecancerhadnotmetastasizedandtheriskofanoper-\nation to remove the cancer was justified \u2014 it is many years\nsince her operation and my sister-in-law remains cancer free.\nI believe that the above story is (among others things) an\neducationalsuccessstory.Ouractionsandreflectionsembod-\nied the ideal of a liberal education: intellectual autonomy.

Never has the need and opportunity for people to\nbecome empowered by knowledge been greater. Thanks to\nthe Internet, everyone can have access to an incredible\namount of information. But making good use of this access\nrequires its own expertise.

Non-professional members of an\naudience should be competent laypeople. More generally,\ncompetent laypeople are people who:\n\u2022 Have a broad understanding of the intellectual landscape\n\u2022 Have strong generic intellectual abilities\n\u2022 Know how to evaluate information and claims outside their\narea of expertise\n\u2022 Can delve more deeply into an area of specialization with\nefficiency and appropriate confidence\n\u2022 Are an informed and appreciative audience for works of arts\nand science.\n\u2022 Have an informed appreciation and understanding of nature\nand society\nCompetentlaypeopleknowtheirintellectuallimits,butalso\nhavetheconfidenceandcompetencetoexpandthem.Mostof\nour lives are spent working and dealing with issues that are\noutsideofourspecifictraining:dealingwitheverythingfrom\ncar problems to personal problems, from doctors to com-\nputer technicians, from troubled children to financial prob-\nlems, from an appreciation of film to the understanding of\npolitical affairs. The sheer breadth of such involvements can\nseem daunting, but that is what is involved in the kind of\npersonally, professionally, and publicly rich lives we hope for\n290MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN graduates.Indevelopingaliberalundergraduateprogram,we\nneedtoconsiderhowwecanbestpreparestudentsforsucha\nfull life.\nThe usefulness of the notion of a competent layperson is\nnot limited to applied fields such as medicine. It can also\nhelp guide the development of aesthetic responsiveness in\nstudents, so that they truly \u201cappreciate art,\u201d and take an\ninformed and sophisticated enjoyment in human creativity.\nCourses in art and music appreciation are explicitly devel-\noped with such instructional ends in mind, but all disciplines\nare expressions of human creativity. All introductions to dis-\nciplines should also have appreciation as a fundamental goal.\nOneshould emerge fromintroductorycourses withaninter-\nestandunderstandingnotonlyofthetheoriesthatconstitute\nthe disciplines (emerge with what a colleague calls \u201chigh con-\nceptual understanding, lowfacility\u201d), but also an appreciation\nof the intellectual enterprise, an understanding of the excite-\nment involved in the reflection and inquiry.

But, of course, disciplines\nareaboutsomething.Wedothemostservicetostudentsifwe\nencourage andfacilitate theirinterestintheworldstudiedby\nthe discipline. An informed appreciation of nature, the past,\nand social phenomena should provide the basis for an ongo-\ning intelligent interest in the world.\nNot only is the concept of a competent layperson tied to\nthe liberal arts tradition of intellectual empowerment, it is\nalsowellsuitedtogivepracticalmeaningtoanotherkeygoal:\ncitizenship.

THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION\nThe traditional ideal of liberal arts as education for liber-\nation \u2014 for freedom from the thrall of tradition and igno-\nrance\u2014continues tobeaworthyone.Unfortunately,associ-\nated with this ideal is often the idea that appeals to authority\nshould be rejected. The great philosophical traditions of the\nmodern age, empiricism and rationalism, are both grounded\ninthenotionthatindividuals canandshoulddecidewhatthe\nfactsofamatteraresolelyonthebasisoftheirownreasoning\nor experiences.\nHowever such an epistemology won\u2019t do. Most of what we\nknow, we know and have rational confidence in because it\nhas appropriate authoritative support. Laypeople must make\ndecisions informed by these expert claims. The epistemolog-\nical basis of the educational ideal of a competent layperson\nrests on this very important point: since most knowledge\nclaimsarerightlygroundedinauthoritativesupport,knowing\nhow to evaluate such support and to question it when appro-\npriateshouldbeacentraleducationalgoal.Instructionshould\nstrive to develop students who have the requisite knowledge,\nconfidence and ability to use and question authoritative\nknowledge. The ideal of the competent layperson is the\nEnlightenment ideal of the reasonable and autonomous per-\nson augmented by recognition of the intellectual dependency\nthat we have on expert developed and credited knowledge.\n292MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ThetypicalEnlightenmentattitudetowardsinformationsup-\nplied by authorities was expressed by John Locke (1690):\nThe floating of other men\u2019s opinions in our brains, makes us\nnot one jot the more knowing, though they happen to be true.\nWhat in them was science, is in us but opiniatrety; whilst we\ngive up our assent only to reverend names, and do not, as they\ndid, employ our own reason to understand those truths which\ngave them reputation. Such borrowed wealth, like fairy money,\nthough it were gold in the hand from which he received it, will\nbe but leaves and dust when it comes to use.\nLocke (like other Enlightenment philosophers) was con-\ncerned to liberate people from accepting hand-me-down\nclaims that were untested and unquestioned by the recipient.\nIntellectual liberation meant the rejection of such claims and\nthe move to establish independently and personally the truth\nof claims. He also believed that this was the model of science.\nWhile such advice was especially salutary at the beginning\nofmodernscience,thesituationtodayismuchmorecomplex.\nNoneofusisequippedtoindependentlyestablishmostofthe\nclaims that we depend on. In our own areas of expertise, we\nmay be able to verify claims, but as Steven Pinker, a leader in\ncognitive science, points out: \u201cNowadays we specialists can-\nnotbemorethanlaypeopleinmostofourowndisciplines,let\nalone neighboring ones\u201d (Pinker 1991). In our own lives, we\nmay be uniquely equipped to verify certain historical claims\n(I was in San Francisco on Sunday), but outside this narrow\nambit, we are in a state of \u201cepistemic dependency\u201d (Hardwig\n1988).\nThis dependency is not necessarily bad; it means that we\ncan know many more things than we could if left to our\nown devices. It is part of the great power of society and lan-\nguage that such knowing can be passed on. The danger, of\ncourse, is that erroneous beliefs can be passed on using the\nsame powerful vehicles. The Internet is rightly criticized for\nbeingapowerfulsourceof\u201cdis-information\u201dsinceanyonecan\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 293 publish claims. Like any great source of power, the Internet\ncomes with its dangers and the key is knowing how to har-\nnessitspower.Knowinghowtoevaluateandquestionsources\nis the key to sorting between knowledge and falsehood. In\nmy sister-in-law\u2019s case, when we challenged our local med-\nical authorities, we did so on the basis of research reported\nby other authorities, not by independently doing pathology\nassessments.\nThe competent layperson must understand the social\nprocesses that collective verification and disciplinary debate\nplay in scientific and other disciplined investigation. The\ncompetent layperson, recognizing that there is considerable\ntime lag between initial claims and their verification, knows\ntolookforthedebateandcounter-evidenceinassessingnovel\nclaims. (The front page of the May 23, 2001 Globe and Mail\ncontained the headline: \u201cScientists prove boys will be boys.\u201d\nThe article is more judicious than the headline, but a compe-\ntentlaypersonwouldbeimmediatelyskepticalofsuchabsurd\nclaim of scientific proof.)\nThe competent layperson may well have to adjudicate\nbetween expert claims much as a judge does when faced with\ncontending experts. The ability to make such judgements is\na key critical thinking ability. It requires an understanding of\nhow claims are verified and established within a discipline or\nprofession,includinganunderstandingoftheimportanceand\nlimits of consensus.\nDespitethepowerofthisconcept,manyinvolvedinthelib-\neral arts may have concerns about its implications. Below I\nwill try to address some of these.\n4. CONCERNS\n4.1. The loss of the ideal of the \u201cliberally educated person\u201d\nThe competent layperson may seem a poor replacement\nfor the rather grander notion of the \u201ceducated person.\u201d The\n294MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN educated person is one who is appropriately steeped in the\nknowledgeoftheculture(whichusedtobelimitedtoWestern\nculture, but now requires even broader knowledge). This is\nusually taken to include familiarity with the classics of both\nfiction and non-fiction and a minimal familiarity with con-\ntemporary science and mathematics.\nThe lack of effective general education requirements in\nmost institutions demonstrates that this ideal is seldom actu-\nally pursued. But its echoes are found in educational mission\nstatements, and it influences the thinking and much of the\ntalk about curriculum, especially for those who work in the\nhumanities. This is an ideal of liberal education that is more\ntimeless and less driven by the narrow economic immediacy\nthat governs courses in areas such as business and engineer-\ning. The ideal of educating individuals in the knowledge of\ntheircultureservestoremindusthatcurriculumshouldhave\nan historical dimension that reaches beyond the passing fads\nanddemandsofcontemporaryculture.Itiscrucialthathigher\neducation base its curricular goals (even in the applied fields)\non concerns and times that extend beyond the immediate\nneeds of the economy and work.\nWhile more obviously practical in its orientation, the ideal\nof a competent layperson also embodies the more timeless\ngoals of liberal education. By emphasizing abilities and\nknowledge that are not job or profession specific, the ideal\nof the competent layperson emphasizes the development of\nuniversallyvaluableskillsandunderstanding.Bystressingthe\nintellectual empowerment necessary to deal with the com-\nplexity of our time, the ideal goes beyond the notion of the\neducatedperson.Thecompetentlayperson,likethe\u201ceducated\nperson\u201d should have the requisite knowledge necessary to be\na fully educated member of society. The difference is that\nthe curriculum of the \u201ceducated person\u201d was determined by\ntradition and what was socially expected of a member of an\neducated elite. What determines the curriculum of the com-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 295 petent layperson is not what is socially required, but rather,\nwhatisneededtofunctionfullyandthoughtfullyinone\u2019sper-\nsonal, vocational, and public life. The educated person was\none who had appropriate knowledge; the competent layper-\nson has appropriate abilities and understanding.\nItmightbethoughtthattheeducationalidealofdeveloping\nacompetentlaypersonisonlyapplicabletothefirsttwoyears\nofanundergraduateeducation.Presumablyithasalwaysbeen\nan implicit goal of the general education requirement to\ndevelop \u201clayperson expertise.\u201d But since many majors no\nlonger prepare one to directly enter a career, they should be\nseen(andhavebeenseenforsometime)aspartofthegeneral\npreparation of an educated person. The traditional rationale\nfor having a student who is not planning to go on in a disci-\npline take a major is that it gives a student an understanding\nof what it is to delve deeply into a topic. For such students,\nthe major is just an aspect of their liberal education. The idea\nthat a BA is mainly about general education is exemplified by\nthewidespreadclaimthataliberalartseducation(notjustthe\nfirst two years) prepares you for life and work by \u201cteaching\nyou to think.\u201d Like the ideal of the educated person, the ideal\nof the competent layperson should be a concept that informs\nthe entire undergraduate project.\n4.2. Practicality\nItmaybe objected that the seeminglypractical approach to\neducationcapturedbytheideaofacompetentlaypersondoes\na disservice to the higher aims of what is, after all, supposed\nto be higher education. But the difficulty is that most of the\nabstract celebrations of liberal education are too far removed\nfrom the actual lives of students and from the instructional\nobjectives of faculty to be of real guidance to educational\npractice. As the great American philosopher, Charles Peirce,\npointed out, the way we make our ideas clear is by indicating\nhow we would test them (Peirce 1878). The kind of behavior\n296MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN that we can expect a competent layperson to exhibit is just\nthekindofdemonstrationofintellectualautonomyweought\nto look for in a liberal arts graduate. It may not be all we are\nlooking for in a liberal education, but in the classic words of\nthe University Chicago President and Great Books advocate,\nRobert Hutchins, education\u2019s job is to \u201cstrengthen minds.\u201d A\ncompetent layperson has a strong mind.\nAdopting the ideal of the competent layperson should also\nhelp clarify the undergraduate project. Ironically, this project\nis often hijacked by the vocational demands of graduate and\nprofessional schools in the liberal arts and the interest that\nfaculty have in preparing acolytes. If we were clear that it is\ncompetent laypeople that liberal programs are preparing, not\npre-competent professionals, many courses would change.\nWe would be preparing students to be readers not literary\ncritics, playgoers not playwrights, biology watchers (see\nThomas 1978) not biologists. Those who went on in these\nfieldswouldstillhaveagoodgeneralgroundingintheirfield,\nwhile the vast majority who do not go on would have had an\nongoing interest and general understanding.\n4.3. Aesthetic and intrinsic value\nOne of the key virtues of the traditional ideal of the edu-\ncated person was the emphasis (in theory) on enhancing stu-\ndents\u2019appreciationofwhatisintrinsicallyvaluable,including\nliterature, art, and scientific inquiry.\nWhile the ideal of the competent layperson includes the\nidea that education should prepare students for meaningful\nwork, it should not be seen as limited to this instrumental\nfunction.Liketheidealoftheeducatedperson,theidealofthe\ncompetent layperson also emphasizes the importance of cul-\ntivating an appreciation of the richness of intrinsically valu-\nablepursuits.Thepublicandmediapreoccupationwithwork\nand consumption tends to create an extraordinarily limited\nview of human possibility. A key goal of liberal education is\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 297 toexpandthestudents\u2019abilitytoenjoytheintrinsicpleasures\nthat derive from appreciation of such pursuits as science and\nthe performing arts. Competent laypeople are the audience\nthat any thoughtful creator would wish for. The competent\nlayperson is competent to enjoy the ends of life and not just\ncompetent at pursuing its means.\n4.4. Pedagogy\nThe goal of post-secondary education as development of a\ncompetentlaypersonraisesquestionsnotonlyaboutcurricu-\nlum but also about pedagogy. Clearly if a student is to grad-\nuate with the intellectual power and confidence of a compe-\ntent layperson, they must have practiced what Sharon Bailin\nand I call \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d (Bailin and Battersby 2016). This\ninvolvesdelvingintoissuesthatengagestudents,butusesthe\npowerofscholarlyresearchtosupportreasonablejudgments.\nIt involves the recognition of the need to consider legitimate\nargumentsandcounter-argumentsoncontroversialissuesbut\nprovides students with tools and concepts to wade through\nthese arguments and come, where possible or necessary, to a\nreasoned judgment (which could be that \u201cwe just don\u2019t know\nenough to decide\u201d).\nAusefulpedagogyistohavestudentsworkinsmallgroups\nonacontroversialissueofsharedinterestinthesubjectbeing\nstudied.Assignstudentsinitiallytopro orconsidesofaques-\ntion for their initial research.

I also provide in-class time for them\nto discuss the question initially from their assigned point of\nview,andthenfromwhateverpointofviewtheyhavecometo\nhold.Forcingstudentstoinitiallydefendpositionswithwhich\nthey disagree is one of the most effective means of getting\nstudents to understand the complexity of controversy and\n298MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN to avoid the fallacy of confirmation bias. If tests are needed\nfor the course, the test created by the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA) provides a model of the kind of \u201cprompts\u201d\nthat might be used to assess students\u2019 ability to do a critical\ninquiry. While the test model \u2013 the prompt \u2013 is a good one,\nthe current method of evaluating the commercially available\ntest is unsatisfactory (see Possin 2013 for concerns about the\ncommercially graded version). (The test prompt is illustrated\nat:\nhttp://cae.org/images/uploads/pdf/CLA_Practice_Assess-\nment.pdf. )\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nThis paper will describe and argue for an approach to fos-\ntering critical thinking in higher education based on inquiry.\nThisapproachencompassesbothcriticalthinkingineveryday\ncontexts and critical thinking within the disciplines.\nA common approach to teaching critical thinking in higher\neducation in North America is through separate courses. The\nfocus tends to be on the evaluation of individual arguments\ntypically found in everyday contexts (e.g., newspaper editori-\nals).Itisassumedthatsuchafocuswillresultinstudentsbeing\nabletothinkcriticallyinrealcontexts.Itisoftenalsoassumed\nthat acquiring the skills of argument evaluation in these con-\ntexts will transfer, where relevant, to critical thinking in par-\nticular disciplinary areas. On the other hand, the assumption\nof traditional teaching in the disciplines has generally been\nthat the modes of argumentation and reasoning of the disci-\nplinewillbeacquiredautomaticallybystudentsthroughlearn-\ning the discipline.\nWe argue in this paper that these assumptions are\nunfounded. Focusing on the evaluation of individual argu-\nmentsisproblematic,basedasitisonafaultymodelofcritical\nthinking which neglects the dialectical and contextual dimen-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 303 sions of reasoning. Knowledge of the arguments on various\nsides of an issue as well as of the historical, intellectual, and\nsocial contexts is essential to making a reasoned judgment on\neveryday issues as well as in disciplinary contexts.\nTheassumptionthatcriticalthinkingwillbeacquiredauto-\nmatically through disciplinary pedagogy is also unfounded.\nReasoning and argumentation are seldom a focus of discipli-\nnary pedagogy. Moreover, this approach neglects the com-\nmon aspects of argumentation which transcend disciplinary\nboundaries.\nWhat we propose as an alternative is an inquiry approach\nto critical thinking pedagogy which focuses on the compara-\ntiveevaluationofcompetingargumentswiththegoalofmak-\ning reasoned judgments (Bailin and Battersby 2016). This\napproach emphasizes both the aspects common to inquiry\nacross a range of areas and the modes of argumentation that\nare specific to the area. This approach can be the focus of a\nseparate course and can also be integrated into disciplinary\ninstruction.\n2. CRITIQUE OF CONVENTIONAL CRITICAL THINKING\nCOURSES\nIt is often the case that the only concerted, overt attempts\nto teach critical thinking and argumentation at the postsec-\nondary level take place through separate courses on critical\nthinking. Such courses are commonly offered in philosophy\ndepartments (at least in North America) and generally limit\ntheir focus to logic, formal or informal, and the evaluation of\nindividual arguments. The arguments used are usually taken\nfrom the media, political speeches, and other sources of\n\u201ceveryday\u201d arguments and are often presented out of context.\nAlthough some popular critical thinking texts with many edi-\ntions(e.g.,MooreandParker2010;Vaughn2012;Waller2011)\nhave started to make some moves away from a sole focus on\nanalyzing de-contextualized arguments, these efforts are\n304MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN episodic (e.g., a section on analyzing longer arguments). None\nof these represents a unified focus on developing the abilities\nand habits of critical inquiry (Hamby 2012; Hitchcock 2013).\nWethereforebelievethatthisapproachisinadequate(Bailin\nand Battersby 2009, 2016). In our view the goal of critical\nthinking instruction is to provide students with the under-\nstandingandskillsnecessaryforthinkingcriticallyinrealcon-\ntexts. And the kind of critical thinking which actually takes\nplace in real contexts, both in the disciplines and in everyday\nlife, centrally involves making reasoned judgments on com-\nplex issues. The focus on reasoned judgments marks an\napproach to critical thinking which can be seen as epistemo-\nlogical (Siegel 1988, 1997; Lipman 1991; Paul 1990). An epis-\ntemological conception views critical thinking in terms of the\nquality of and criteria for good reasoning, and focuses less on\nargumentspersethandoesamorelogically-orientedconcep-\ntion.\nIndeed,itisourviewthatarrivingatreasonedjudgmentson\ncomplexissuesinvolvesmorethantheevaluationofindividual\narguments. Itinvolvesaprocess whichisdialectical (Blairand\nJohnson 1987, pp.45-46). To say that the process is dialectical\nmeans that it takes place in the context of some controversy\nor debate. This implies that it is initiated by some question,\ndoubt, challenge, and that there is a diversity of views on the\nissue, arguments both for and against (if the controversy is\ngenuine,thenitislikelythattherewillbeatleastsomeplausi-\nbleargumentsonbothsides(Johnson2003,p.42)).Thedialec-\nticalaspectalsomeansthatthereisaninteractionbetweenthe\narguersandbetweentheargumentsinvolvingcriticism,objec-\ntions, responses, and, frequently, revisions to initial positions\n(Bailin and Battersby 2009; Johnson 2000).\nAn implication of this view is that it is seldom the case that\nreasons and arguments can be evaluated individually in any\ncomprehensive or significant manner. It is possible to evalu-\nateindividual arguments inapreliminary,prima facie manner,\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 305 discovering fallacies or errors in reasoning and evaluating the\nreasons or evidence in support of the conclusion (Bailin and\nBattersby2016).Inordertoreachareasonedjudgmentonthe\nissueinquestion,however,wemustgobeyondthisprimafacie\nevaluation and evaluate the arguments in the context of this\ndialectic, of this historical and ongoing process of debate and\ncritique. In order to reach a reasoned judgment, arguments\nneedtobeevaluatedcomparatively,inlightofalternativesand\ncompeting arguments and views (Bailin and Battersby 2009,\n2016; Johnson 2007, p.4; Kuhn 1991, pp.201f).\nA major weakness of traditional critical thinking courses is\nthat they do not focus on the kind of comparative evaluation\nwhichwemakeinactualcontextsofdisagreementanddebate.\nIt is this dialectical and contextual dimension which is largely\nmissing from traditional critical thinking instruction.\n3. CRITIQUE OF CONVENTIONAL DISCIPLINARY\nTEACHING\nAdifferentsortofproblemarisesinthecontextofattempt-\ningtodevelopcriticalthinkinginthedisciplines.Theassump-\ntion of traditional teaching in the disciplines has generally\nbeen that the modes of argumentation and reasoning of the\ndiscipline will be acquired automatically by students through\nlearning the discipline. Yet this assumption appears to be\nunfounded. Much research has indicated that even post-sec-\nondary students studying a discipline do not necessarily rea-\nson well in that discipline (Hestenes, Wells and Swackhamer\n1992; Jungwirth 1987; Ferraro and Taylor 2005). This should\nnotbeparticularlysurprisinggiventhefactthatreasoningand\nargumentation are generally not a focus of disciplinary ped-\nagogy. While many instructors admit the need to emphasize\ncritical thinking, this concern is often overridden by the need\nto cover disciplinary content.\nAnother problem with leaving the acquisition of reasoning\nto the vagaries of disciplinary teaching is that this approach\n306MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN neglects the aspects of argumentation which transcend dis-\nciplinary boundaries. To the extent that the reasoning in the\ndiscipline is a focus of study, it is likely to be limited to the\ntypeofreasoningandargumentationcharacteristicofthepar-\nticular discipline, for example \u201cscientific method\u201d in the sci-\nences.Theaspectsofargumentationcommontovariousdisci-\nplinesandtonon-disciplinarycontextssuchastheprocedures\nfor conducting an inquiry, the logical analysis of arguments,\nfallacies and common errors in reasoning, the evaluation of\nsources, and those criteria for evaluation which are common\nacrossdomainsarenotlikelytobeincluded.Thustheconnec-\ntionbetweeninquiryintheparticulardisciplineandthelarger\nenterprise of inquiry is not likely to be made.\nAn additional problem with much traditional disciplinary\nteaching is that it tends to neglect the dialectical dimension\nof argumentation. But, as was pointed out above, reasoning\nand argumentation need to be evaluated in the context of the\ndialectic in which it arises and is embedded. This is equally\nthe case for making a reasoned judgment in a discipline as it\nis for making judgments in everyday contexts. Making such\njudgments involves weighing and balancing competing argu-\nments and so requires an understanding of the dialectic and a\ngrounding in the debates within the discipline.\nSimply introducing students to a variety of competing the-\nories is insufficient, however. They also require the resources\nfor comparatively evaluating these theories and judging\namongthem.Oneoftherequirementsforcomparativelyeval-\nuating competing theories and views is an understanding of\ndiscipline specific modes of argument and criteria, for exam-\nple causal reasoning in science, statistical reasoning in the\nsocial sciences, or historical reasoning in history, which may\nnotbeaddressedinseparatecriticalthinkingcourses.Without\na grounding in the debates within the discipline and without\nanexplicitfocusonthemodesofargumentationandtheeval-\nuation criteria which are specific to the area, the modes of\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 307 argumentation and reasoning in particular disciplines are not\nlikely to be learned.\n4. TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING AS INQUIRY\nWhatweproposeasanalternativeisaninquiryapproachto\ncriticalthinkingpedagogy.Weusetheterminquirytoreferto\nthe careful, critical examination of an issue in order to come\nto a reasoned judgment. While the term inquiry is not com-\nmon in the critical thinking literature, Hitchcock\u2019s notion of\nargumentative discussion has considerable overlap with our\nnotion of inquiry: \u201cAn argumentative discussion is a sociocul-\ntural activity of constructing, presenting, interpreting, criti-\ncizing, and revising arguments for the purpose of reaching a\nshared rationally supported position on some issue\u201d (Hitch-\ncock 2002, p.291).\nThere are several aspects of inquiry that are significant in\nthis approach. The first is that inquiry requires focus on an\nissue. An inquiry is initiated by some challenge, controversy\nor difference of view that is in need of resolution. The second\naspect of significance is that inquiry involves a critical exami-\nnationofevidence,argumentsandpointsofview.Itisnotjust\nan information-gathering enterprise but involves, centrally, a\ncriticalevaluationaccordingtorelevantcriteria.Thethirdsig-\nnificant aspect is that inquiry aims toward a reasoned judg-\nment.Byareasonedjudgmentwemeannotsimplyajudgment\nfor which one has reasons, but a judgment for which one has\ngoodreasons,reasonswhichmeetrelevantstandards.Making\nareasonedjudgmentisnotsimplyamatterofevaluatingindi-\nvidual arguments, however. Rather, it requires the compara-\ntiveevaluation ofcompeting arguments and views (Bailin and\nBattersby 2016).\nAn inquiry approach emphasizes both the aspects common\nto inquiry across a range of areas and the aspects and modes\nof argumentation that are specific to an area.

The various aspects that go into the process of inquiry\nare learned not as de-contextualized \u201cskills\u201d but rather in the\ncontext of coming to reasoned judgments on complex issues.\n4.1. Teaching Inquiry in Separate Courses\nHow might one teach critical thinking as inquiry in a sep-\narate course? Our critical thinking text, Reason in the Balance:\nAn Inquiry Approach to Critical Thinking (Bailin and Battersby\n2016), provides one example of an inquiry approach to teach-\ning critical thinking. The text uses dialogues among an ongo-\ning cast of characters involved in realistic situations as a con-\ntextfordiscussingthevariousaspectsthatgointothepractice\nof inquiry, including identifying issues, identifying the rele-\nvant contexts, understanding the competing cases, and mak-\ning a comparative judgment among them. These aspects are\ninstantiated in inquiries on topics such as vegetarianism, the\nminimum wage, the legalization of marijuana, the regulation\nof dangerous dogs, the evaluation of a film, the bombing of\nHiroshima, and the right of hate groups to speak. These var-\nious aspects are also applied to inquiry in specific contexts,\nincluding science, social science, philosophy, and the arts.\nThere is also considerable emphasis placed throughout on the\nhabits of mind which are essential for inquiry, including\n(among others) open-mindedness, fair-mindedness, the desire\nto act on the basis of reasons, the acceptance of uncertainty,\nand respect for others in dialogue \u2013 habits of mind which we\ncharacterize as the spirit of inquiry.\n4.1.1. Guiding questions for inquiry\nThe following set of guiding questions is used to structure\ninquiry throughout the text:\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 309 \u2022 What is the issue?\n\u2022 What kinds of claims or judgments are at issue?\n\u2022 Whataretherelevantreasonsandarguments onvarioussides\nof the issue?\n\u2022 What is the context of the issue?\n\u2022 How do we comparatively evaluate the various reasons and\narguments to reach a reasoned judgment?\nThe text devotes chapters to each of these questions, with\nthe students developing an understanding of each, applying\nthem in practice contexts, and then using each one in turn to\nprogressively develop an inquiry on a topic of their choosing.\nThrough this process, the various aspects of inquiry are inte-\ngrated and students gain proficiency in conducting inquiries.\nWe have reproduced here an excerpt from one of a series\nofdialoguesbetweentwostudents,PhilandSophia,oncapital\npunishment. We shall use this example (the present excerpt\nandthedialoguesthatfollowit)toillustrateeachoftheaspects\nof inquiry.\nPhil has been reading an opinion piece in a newspaper\ninwhichthechiefofpoliceofhistownisarguingforcap-\nital punishment for murder.\nPhil: Hey, Sophia\u2014let me read you something interest-\ning:\n\u201cSocietyhasanobligation,firstandforemost,toprotect\nitscitizensfromharm.Andthemostseriousformofharm\nis murder. Protecting citizens from murder involves\nensuring that murderers don\u2019t repeat the offence. It also\ninvolves dissuading others from committing murder.\nNow I and other law enforcement officers know from a\nvast amount of firsthand experience with criminals that\nthe only form of punishment that can effectively achieve\nboth goals is the death penalty. Capital punishment\ninvolves taking the life of a person who has committed\n310MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN murder in order to save the lives of innocent people, and\nso is the best option under the circumstances.\u201d\nPhil:Whathesaysmakesalotofsense.Afterall,society\nneeds to do whatever it can to protect innocent people.\nAndmurderershavereallygivenuptheirrighttobepro-\ntectedbecausethey\u2019vetakensomeoneelse\u2019slife.Sokilling\nthem to save innocent people seems OK.\nSophia:Holdonaminute,Phil!Notsofast.You\u2019releap-\ning to conclusions again.

Your\npolicechiefcertainlyhasn\u2019tgivenusanyofthearguments\nagainstcapital punishment.\nPhil:But what about his argument?\nSophia: I think that there\u2019s a lot more that we need to\nknow before we can decide whether his argument is any\ngood.Weneedmoreinformation.Weneedtoknowsome\nfacts about capital punishment.

Conduct an inquiry!\nSophia: Now the first step, if I remember right, is to be\nclear about what the issue is.\nPhil: That\u2019s pretty easy. The issue is whether we should\nhave capital punishment.\nSophia: For what crimes? We need to be specific. In\nsome countries, there\u2019s the death penalty for adultery.\nPhil: No, no \u2014 I wasn\u2019t suggesting that. I\u2019m only think-\ning about cases of premeditated murder.\nSophia:I\u2019m glad you\u2019re clear about that.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 311 Phil:OK...nextquestion\u2014whatkindofjudgmentdoes\nthis involve?\nSophia:Well,sincewe\u2019retalkingaboutwhatwe\u201cshould\u201d\nor \u201cshould not\u201d do, then I guess it\u2019s an evaluative judg-\nment. But I can see already that we\u2019ll also need to look at\nsomefactualclaimsontheway\u2014likewhethercapitalpun-\nishmentreallydoeshelppreventmurders(BailinandBat-\ntersby 2016, pp.185\u2013186).\nWhat is the issue?\nIn order to even begin to inquire, it is of vital importance\nto be clear about the issue which is to be impetus for the\ninquiry. Among the characteristics of an appropriate issue are\nthat it be sufficiently focused to allow for productive inquiry;\npreciselyandneutrallyframed,avoidingvague,ambiguous,or\nbiased formulations; and controversial, evoking genuine dis-\nagreement.\nInthedialogueexcerpt,SophianotesthatPhil\u2019soriginalfor-\nmulation oftheissue, whether weshouldhavecapital punish-\nment, is too vague as it does not specify for which crimes.\nWhat kinds of claims or judgments are at issue?\nIt is important to understand what types of judgments are\ncalled for by the inquiry which we are undertaking because\ndifferent types of judgments are supported by different types\nofreasonsandargumentsandareevaluatedbydifferentcrite-\nria.Forexample,whileajudgmentinsciencewillappealtothe\ncriterionoffitwithobservations,amoraljudgmentwillappeal\nto reasoning according to moral principles. Although there is\narangeoftypesofjudgments,theycanbecategorizedbroadly\ninto three types: factual judgments, evaluative judgments, and\ninterpretive judgments.\nInthedialogue,PhilandSophiarecognizethattheirinquiry\ncalls for an evaluative judgment about whether capital pun-\nishment should or should not be practiced, but that it will also\ninvolve factual judgments, for example with respect to\nwhether capital punishment really does act as a deterrent. As\n312MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN the inquiry proceeds, they also recognize that their inquiry\nwill require moral judgments, for example with respect to the\nrisk of the state executing innocent individuals.\nAs another example, if students wished to address the issue\nof climate change, they would need to be able to distinguish\namongthekindsofjudgmentsrequiredbydifferentquestions\nabout climate change, e.g.: \u201cIs the climate changing signifi-\ncantly?\u201d (factual descriptive); \u201cIs climate change humanly\ncaused?\u201d (factual causal); \u201cWhat, if anything, should we do\nabout climate change?\u201d (evaluative).\nWhat are the relevant reasons and arguments on various sides of\nthe issue?\nAkeyaspectofinquiryinvolveslayingouttheargumentson\nvarious sides of an issue. This will include the various posi-\ntions on the issue in question that have been offered; the evi-\ndence that has been brought forward and the arguments that\nhavebeenmadeindefenseofthevariouspositions;theobjec-\ntions that have been levelled against the positions and the\nresponses that have been made to these; the alternatives that\nhave been put forth.\nIn the dialogue, Phil is initially inclined to accept the one\nargument in favor of capital punishment which he reads but\nSophiarecognizestheneedtolookatthewholedebateandto\nevaluate thearguments onbothsides oftheissue beforemak-\ning a judgment. In a subsequent dialogue, after doing some\nresearch,theydiscoveranumberofargumentswhicharegen-\nerally offered both in favor of capital punishment (e.g., argu-\nments from deterrence, incapacitation, retribution, and cost)\nandagainst(e.g.,argumentsfocusedontheimmoralityoftak-\ning a life, the immorality of executing innocent individuals,\nrehabilitation, and the social causes of crime). They also find\nthe various objections and responses which have been offered\ntothesearguments.Makingajudgmentontheissueofcapital\npunishment will ultimately require them to be aware of this\nentire dialectic.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 313 What is the context of the issue?\nFinding out about the contexts in which issues are situated\ncanprovidevaluableinformationwhenconductinganinquiry.\nThere are three aspects of context that we believe need to be\nconsidered:thestateofpractice,thehistoryofthedebate,and\nthe intellectual, social, political, and historical contexts.\nThe state of practice refers to how things currently stand\nwith respect to the issue. An understanding of the state of\npractice can provide information necessary for making a rea-\nsoned judgment. For example, in order for students to make\na reasoned judgment regarding the raising of the minimum\nwage, they would need to know information such as the wage\nin other jurisdictions, when the minimum wage was last\nraised, the effect of inflation on wages, costs of living, and so\non.\nThe history of the debate refers to the history of argumen-\ntation and deliberation which has led to current practice or\nthinking about the issue. Knowledge of the history of the\ndebate can be helpful and is in some cases essential to under-\nstanding what is significant or contentious about an issue and\nin understanding the various positions which are contesting\nforacceptance.Knowingthehistoryofadebateisalsoimpor-\ntant in determining where the burden of proof lies.\nUnderstanding the intellectual, political, historical, and\nsocial contexts surrounding an issue is also important in that\nitcanaidusinunderstandingandinterpretingargumentsand\ncan reveal assumptions underlying arguments and positions\nwhich may be important for their evaluation. For example,\nin making judgments about the legalization of marijuana in\nNorth America, it would be important to understand aspects\nof the history and social context of marijuana prohibition,\nincludingthefactthatthereisanenormousgovernmentaland\npolice investment in drug prohibition.\nIn a dialogue subsequent to the one reproduced above,\nSophia and Phil investigate each of these aspects with respect\n314MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN to the capital punishment debate. They discover the current\nstate of practice in their location (that there is no capital pun-\nishment) as well as the situation worldwide \u2013 a general trend\ntoward abolition, and recognize the argumentative implica-\ntions of these facts in terms of which views carry the burden\nofproof(thosewhichgoagainstcurrentpractices).Lookingat\nthe history of the debate, they discover that some of the argu-\nments (e.g., retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation) have\nveryancientroots,andalsothattheprimaryargumentoffered\nin favor of capital punishment has changed recently from\ndeterrence to retribution in light of the lack of evidence of a\ndeterrent effect. With respect to the intellectual, social, polit-\nical, and historical contexts, they recognize that the pro and\nconpositionsoncapitalpunishmenttendtobeassociatedwith\ndifferent worldviews with respect to issues such as tradition\nversus change in society, individual versus societal responsi-\nbility, and social order.\nHow do we comparatively evaluate the various reasons and argu-\nments to reach a reasonedjudgment?\n\u2022 Evaluating individual arguments\nThecoreofaninquiryistheevaluationofthevariousviews\nand arguments in order to reach a reasoned judgment.

What it does mean is\nthat they must go on to evaluate the various claims.\nWith respect to the factual claims, after extensive investiga-\ntion, they succeed in determining that there is a consensus in\nthe research that capital punishment does not act as a deter-\nrent to murder. The also discover that the claim that capital\npunishmentislesscostlythanlifeimprisonment isfalse.With\nrespect to the moral arguments, they decide that there is a\nmorally appropriate desire for justice behind the retribution\nargument for capital punishment, but that the concern about\nthe state executing innocent people constitutes a very strong\nmoral argument against capital punishment.\n\u2022 Comparative evaluation\nTheevaluationoftheindividualargumentsisnecessary,but\nitgenerallycannotonitsownleadtothemakingofareasoned\njudgment. In order to come to a reasoned judgment, we need\ntoperformacomparativeevaluationoftheargumentsinorder\ntodeterminetheirweightintermsoftheoverallcase,andthen\ncombinethevariousevaluationsinordertomakeafinaljudg-\nment. This process involves balancing the various considera-\ntions which have come to light.\nIn their final dialogue on capital punishment, Sophia and\nPhilsummarizetheirevaluationofthevariousargumentsand\nweigh their comparative strength. In terms of the pro argu-\nments, they conclude that there is no support for the deter-\nrence or cost arguments, that incapacitation can be achieved\nby less drastic means than putting the perpetrators to death,\nand that there is some moral legitimacy to the retribution\nargument in terms of the desire for justice but that it can be\nachievedthroughlifeimprisonment.Intermsoftheconargu-\nments,theyconcludethattheriskofthestatekillinginnocent\ncitizensisaverystrongargumentwhichoverridestheretribu-\n316MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN tionargument,especiallyastherearelessmorallyproblematic\nalternatives to capital punishment which can achieve retribu-\ntion. Their anti-capital punishment judgment is strengthened\nby the worldwide trend toward abolition which places a bur-\nden of proof on the pro side.\n4.1.2. Inquiries in Specific Areas\nIt is our belief that, if our goal is to foster students\u2019 critical\nthinking in the range of contexts which they will encounter,\nthen it is important in a critical thinking course to include\ninquiries that focus on disciplinary knowledge and criteria in\nareas such as science, social science, philosophy, and the arts.\nThus,inadditiontofocusingontopicssuchascapitalpunish-\nment, the text also focuses on topics which require a knowl-\nedge of discipline-specific procedures and criteria, for exam-\nple polygamy (philosophy), the effects of violent video games\n(thesocialsciences),interpretingachallengingworkofart(the\narts), and some historical examples of inquiries in geology,\nepidemiology, and evolutionary theory (the natural sciences).\nThese inquiries exemplify both how the guiding questions,\nproceduresandcriteriaapplyinvariousareasandalsothecri-\nteria which are specific to the discipline.\n5. INTEGRATING INQUIRY INTO SUBJECT AREA\nINSTRUCTION\nThe inquiry approach can also provide a method for instill-\ningcritical thinking intodiscipline-focusedcourses whilestill\nproviding adequate coverage of course material.

Nosich\u2019s recom-\nmendationtofocusstudentthinkingonadeepunderstanding\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 317 of the central concepts of a discipline is very much in conso-\nnance with an inquiry approach (Nosich 2012).\nFor an inquiry approach to be successful, the instructors\nneed to be clear about the long-term learning goals of the\ncourse. This is especially important for introductory or gen-\neral education courses where students are unlikely to go on\nfurther in the discipline. Presumably the goals will include\nengaging the student in the subject and the disciplinary\napproachtosubjectmatter,butshouldalsoincludeempower-\ningstudentstousethemethodsandinformationproducedby\nthe discipline to make thoughtful and reasonable decisions as\nindividuals, citizens and workers. As long as the primary goal\nof a course, especially an introductory course, is to lay down\na basic vocabulary or get students to retain abundant factual\ninformation, it will be difficult to devote enough time or stu-\ndent energy to learning how to inquire and to understanding\nargumentation in the discipline. But if the primary outcomes\nincludeanunderstandingoftheissuesandclaimsinthedisci-\npline and the ability to make reasoned judgments using disci-\nplinarycriteria,thentheinquiryapproachcanbeusedbothto\nreinforcethelearningofsubjectmaterialandtodevelopthose\nabilities and habits of mind that lead to reasoned judgment.\nFor example, students in an ecology course could be asked to\nassess local laws governing logging. Through engaging in this\ninquiry,studentswouldlearntherequisiteecologicalconcepts\nof forest development and sustainability, but they would also\nlearn what is involved in coming to a reasoned judgment on\nthe issue.\nTo illustrate how one might integrate the inquiry approach\nintodisciplinaryteaching,wewillshowhoweachoftheguid-\ningquestionscouldbeusedtoaddressthequestionsoflogging\nand forest management.\nWhat is the issue?\nInordertopursuethisinquiry,studentswouldneed,first,to\nbeclearabouttheissueorquestion.Isthequestionwhatregu-\n318MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN lations would provide for sustainable logging? Or is the ques-\ntion how to protect ecosystems for animal conservation?\nWhat kinds of claims or judgments are at issue?\nIt would be important, for this inquiry, to distinguish\nbetween normative claims and judgments about the value of\nforests, and scientific claims about the consequences of log-\nging on fishing or ecosystem health. The idea of \u201cecosystem\nhealth\u201d is a good example of a concept that students would\nneed to grapple with in trying to sort out value and factual\nquestions.\u201cHealth\u201disacomplexconceptincludingbothnorms\nand facts and getting clear about what is at issue is an impor-\ntant intellectual challenge.\nWhat are the relevant reasons and arguments on various sides of\nthe issue?\nEcologicalissuesareoftencharacterizedbybias,andgetting\na full range of views with their attendant arguments is obvi-\nously important for making a reasoned judgment.

We would like to stress, however, that this\napproachcanbeusedinvirtuallyanysubjectarea,forexample\nin the social science (e.g., Should we allow our children to\nwatch violent video games?), in the arts (e.g., Is Duchamps\u2019s\nurinalreallyart?),orinphilosophy(Shouldpolygamybelegal?)\n(Bailin and Battersby 2016).\n320MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN 6. FOSTERING INQUIRY ACROSS THE DISCIPLINES\nSome more general strategies can also be employed in all\nareas in order to foster inquiry across disciplinary areas. The\ngoal is to promote an understanding of the process of inquiry\npracticed in the particular area as just one example of the\nenterprise of inquiry more broadly, involving a similar aim,\nnamely to reach a reasoned judgment, common guiding ques-\ntions,somecommonoroverlappingconceptsandcriteria,and\nthe same habits of mind (e.g., open-mindedness, fair-minded-\nness, a commitment to reason, an inquiring attitude) (Bailin\nand Battersby 2016).\nOne particularly important habit of mind that is central for\ninquiry in all areas is the propensity to always consider alter-\nnative views and theories. In order to develop this habit of\nmind, students can be required to defend competing theo-\nries with which they disagree and attempt to come to reason-\nable conclusions despite conflicting evidence and theories. It\nisoftenanilluminatingexperienceforstudentstounderstand\ntheir resistance to evidence and argument for a theory with\nwhich they have a prior disagreement.\nManykeyconceptsareusedwidelyinmanyareas(e.g.,con-\ncepts common in the sciences such as the distinction between\ncorrelationandcausation,theproblemofgettingreliabledata,\nthe question of experimental validity, the problem of confir-\nmation bias). All these widely shared concepts can be rein-\nforced in almost any subject. Even such subjects as literary or\nartistic analysis can be shown frequently to involve reasoning\ntothebestexplanationwhileconsideringalternativepointsof\nview.\nThe ideal situation for teaching inquiry across the disci-\nplines would be one in which instructors were aware of how\nfaculty in other disciplines presented the key concepts of\ninquiry and critical thinking so that these concepts could be\nreinforced in all courses. This is a lot to hope for, but the\nnotionsofseekingalternativeexplanations,weighingcompet-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 321 ingarguments,andcomingtoareasonedconclusionaresuffi-\nciently applicable across a range of subject areas that parallels\ncan usefully be drawn. It is useful to ask students whether\nthey recognize that argumentative and evaluative approaches\nin one course have analogies with those approaches used in\nother courses.\nBecause many of the problems of the real world involve\ninterdisciplinary or multidisciplinary inquiries, there is a\nwealthoftopicsandissueswhichmaybeofgenuineinterestto\nstudentsandwhichcouldbeusedtoillustratehowsomeofthe\nrelevant evaluative criteria can be applied across disciplines.\n7. CONCLUSION\nWebelievethataninquiryapproachtoteachingargumenta-\ntion and reasoning is to be recommended for several reasons.\nFirst, in broadening the focus from the evaluation of individ-\nual arguments to the making of reasoned judgments, it aims\ntofoster the kind of critical thinking which takes place in real\ncontexts of disagreement and debate. This changed emphasis\nbrings to the fore the dialectical and contextual dimensions\nof argumentation, which are central to the making of rea-\nsoned judgments. An inquiry approach also makes room for\nthe inclusion of disciplinary criteria and modes of argumen-\ntation when dealing with everyday issues, the knowledge of\nwhich is often essential for making judgments with respect to\ncomplex, real-world issues.\nThere are also dispositional benefits to an inquiry based\napproach. The requirement to actively seek information and\nargumentsinordertoresolveanissueorpuzzlementmayfos-\nter habits of mind such as intellectual curiosity, truth-seek-\ning, self-awareness, and intellectual perseverance. In addition,\nan open-minded, fair-minded, and flexible attitude is much\nmore likely to be encouraged by an approach which focuses\noninquiringthroughtheevaluationofcompetingcasesrather\n322MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN thanononefocusedexclusivelyontheevaluationofindividual\narguments (Bailin and Battersby 2009).\nWith respect to teaching within the disciplines, an inquiry\napproachhastheadvantageofputtinganexplicitfocusondis-\nciplinary reasoning and argumentation, making reasoning a\ncentral part of what it means to learn a discipline. By high-\nlighting the aspects of argumentation which are distinctive\nto particular disciplines, it gives students the tools to reason\nwell within those disciplines and with respect to issues which\ncall on disciplinary understanding. But it also has the addi-\ntional merit of highlighting those aspects of argumentation\nwhich are common to inquiry across disciplines. In so doing,\nit makes explicit the connection between disciplinary inquiry\nandinquirymorebroadly,enablingstudentstoviewreasoning\nandargumentationinanydisciplinenotasanisolatedactivity\nbutratherasconnectedwithothercriticalpracticesofinvesti-\ngation, discovery and creation.\nTo date, our main basis for evaluating an inquiry approach\nis personal experience.

In addition,\nHitchcock(2013)hascollecteddataonmorethan400students\noverthethreeoccasionsinwhichheusedReasonintheBalance.\nWhat he found was that, although students did not do as well\nas previous students on some types of multiple-choice exam\nquestions testing the micro-skills of argument analysis and\nevaluation, they did noticeably better on items testing their\nabilitytoidentifyacounter-exampletoageneralization,judge\nthe trustworthiness of a source of information, and analyze\nand evaluate causal arguments.

INTRODUCTION\nThe notion of virtue, recently popular in epistemology, has\nnow also found application in argumentation theory. Indeed,\na number of theorists are attempting to ground a theory of\nargumentationaroundvirtue,muchinthewaythatepistemol-\nogists have tried to do with virtue epistemology (Cohen 2007,\n2009,2012;Aberdeen2007,2010).Whetherornotoneaccepts\nthis type of agent-centered account of argumentation, it is\nclear that the notion of virtues forms a central component of\nmosttheoriesofcriticalthinking.Whathasbeengiveninsuffi-\ncient attention, however, is how one might go about fostering\nthese virtues. It is this issue that is the focus of this paper.\nWe begin by examining the notion of virtue and what con-\nstitutes the virtues of argumentation or critical thinking. We\nargue that the notion of virtue is more appropriate for char-\nacterizing this aspect than the notion of dispositions com-\nmonly employed by critical thinking theorists. We also make\nthe argument that it is more illuminating to speak of the\nvirtues of inquiry rather than of argumentation. The remain-\nder of the paper focuses on the issue of how these virtues\nmight be developed.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 327 2. THE VIRTUES OF INQUIRY\nWhat, exactly, are the virtues of argumentation or critical\nthinking (Cohen uses the two interchangeably)? Cohen\ndescribes them thus:\nIn order to bypass the debates as to exactly what sort of thing\na virtue is, let us stipulate that argumentative or critical virtues\naretheacquiredhabitsandskillsthathelpusachievethegoalsof\ncritical thinking (Cohen 2009, p.54).\nCohen\u2019sinclusionof\u201cskills\u201daswellas\u201chabits\u201dinhisconcep-\ntionofvirtuerunscountertocommonusage.Indeed,theorists\ntend to include the dimension referred to by the term virtue\nintheirconceptionofcriticalthinkingtorefertopreciselythe\naspect which goes beyond skills.1 The aspect of critical think-\ning of interest here, and the aspect commonly picked out in\ntheories of critical thinking by the term \u201cvirtue,\u201d is this addi-\ntional dimension.23\nThisdimension,althoughcentraltomosttheoriesofcritical\nthinking,hasbeendescribedinvariouswaysbydifferenttheo-\nrists. Virtue argumentation theorists, as well as some philoso-\nphers and philosophers of education (Paul 1990, Burbules\n1995,BailinandBattersby2007),usethetermvirtues.Others,\ne.g., Bailin et al. (1999a), refer to habits of mind. Peters talks\nabout \u201crational passions\u201d (Peters 1972). The most common\ncharacterization,however,isintermsofdispositions(see,e.g.,\nEnnis 1996; Siegel 1988). This dispositional dimension has\n1.See the next section for a discussion of the problems with the concept of skill to capture this\naspect.\n2.See Aberdein 2007 for a discussion of the importance of distinguishing between argumen-\ntative virtues and skills, e.g., \u201cThe exact same fallacy, say an equivocation on a word with\ntwo subtly but crucially distinct senses, could result from either a failure of virtue, if delib-\nerately intended to deceive, or from a failure of skill, if the utterer did not notice the double\nmeaning\u201d (p.7).\n3.Bowell and Kingsbury (2014) do, at times, use the language of virtue for all the aspects, dis-\ntinguishing between epistemic reliabilist virtues (skills), motivational virtues (the commit-\nment to rational belief and action), and regulatory virtues (the sub-virtues), but they also\nrefer to the reliabilist virtues as skills.\n328MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN several components. One is a fundamental commitment to\nrational belief and action, well captured by Siegel\u2019s notion of\ncritical spirit (Siegel 1988), Bailin and Battersby\u2019s spirit of\ninquiry (Bailin and Battersby 2016), or Hamby\u2019s willingness\nto inquire (Hamby 2014). The other component is behavioral:\nan inclination to act in accordance with the norms of reason.\nWhether they are called virtues, habits of mind, or disposi-\ntions,thelistofaspectstobeincludedisstrikinglysimilar,for\nexample: open-mindedness, fair-mindedness, curiosity, con-\ncern for truth and accuracy, the desire to act on the basis of\nreason (Bailin and Battersby 2016); love of truth, repugnance\nof distortion and evasion, respect for the arguments of others\n(Peters 1972); intellectual humility, intellectual courage, intel-\nlectualintegrity,intellectualperseverance,faithinreason(Paul\n1990).Thereissomediscussionintheliteratureregardingthe\ninclusionofparticularcandidatevirtues,e.g.,sincerity(Cohen\n2009b, Allen 2009), ingenuity (Morin 2014), receptivity (Nor-\nlock 2013), proportionality (Cohen 2009b, Aiken and Clanton\n2010). Nonetheless, an overarching commitment to reasoning\nand a set of sub-virtues which are grounded in that commit-\nment are common features of the various accounts.\nWhy, then, characterize this aspect of critical thinking in\ntermsofvirtuesratherthandispositions?Thetermdisposition\nis used in this context to describe a behavior, a habit, an indi-\nvidual tendency to act in a certain way; it can also be used\nto refer to an imputed quality or property of an individual\nby virtue of which they behave in this manner (Siegel 1999).\nThus having a disposition to be fair-minded means that the\nindividual has a tendency to act in a fair-minded manner. It\nmay imply, further, that the impulse to act in this way has an\ninternalratherthananexternalsource(e.g.,theyarenotbeing\nforced etc.).\nA significant problem with the characterization in terms of\ndispositions is that it actually tells us very little about why\nthe person tends to act in this way. The property sense does\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 329 rule out external sources of behaviour, but it would not rule\nout cases where the individual behaves in a certain manner\nbecauseofblindhabitorbecausetheyhaveassimilatedcertain\nexternal forces, e.g., if they have been indoctrinated or are\nunconsciously trying to live up to the expectations of a past\nteacher. This seems fundamentally different from acting in\nthismannerbecausetheyunderstandtheenterpriseandvalue\nits procedures and goals (Bailin and Battersby 2007). It is the\nlatter that is picked out by the concept of virtue. Burbules\n(1995) makes the point thus:\n\u201cDisposition\u201d tends to refer to individual tendencies, often\nascribed from an external perspective through observation and\nbehaviouristinference.Avirtue,ontheotherhand,isnotamere\nexpression of habit, but an expression of judgment and choice\n(1995, p.86).\nAnd further:\nthey[virtues]arenotsimplytheactivatingsentimentsthatmoti-\nvateustoapplytheformalruleswehavelearned,buttheaspects\nofcharacterthatbringustocareaboutlearningorpayingatten-\ntion to such standards in the first place\u2026 A person who is rea-\nsonable wants to make sense, wants to be fair to alternative\npoints of view, wants to be careful and prudent in the adoption\nofimportantpositionsinlife,iswillingtoadmitwhenheorshe\nhas made a mistake, and so on (1995, p.86).\nThenotionofdispositionsgainsitscurrencyfromitsappli-\ncation in the physical realm. According to Quine, \u201ca disposi-\ntionaltermisapromissorynoteforaneventualdescriptionin\nmechanical terms\u201d (1973, p.14). In the physical realm, such an\neventual mechanical description is the goal, but in the case of\ncritical thinking, it is not a mechanical description which is at\nissue. A promissory note is not required because we already\nunderstand how to characterize this aspect \u2013 in terms of such\nconceptsasunderstanding,beliefs,valuesandattitudes(Bailin\nand Battersby 2007).\n330MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN The views highlighted here refer to the virtues of argumen-\ntation or critical thinking, but we would maintain that they\narebetterthoughtofasthevirtuesofinquiry.Wehaveargued\nelsewhere (Bailin and Battersby 2009) that the central goal of\nargumentation/critical thinking is arriving at reasoned judg-\nments,andthatthisisadialecticalprocessinvolvingthecom-\nparative evaluation of a variety of contending positions and\narguments. This enterprise is one which we characterize as\ninquiry(BailinandBattersby2016).Itistruethatarguersmay\nplaydifferentrolesinparticularargumentativeexchanges,e.g.,\nas proponents or opponents, judges or spectators (Cohen\n2013). And they often have various intentions in arguing, e.g.,\nrational persuasion, decision-making, justification (Johnson\n2007); greater understanding of their own or an opponent\u2019s\nposition, or of \u201cthe big picture\u201d (Cohen 2009b). Nonetheless,\nwhatevertheparticularroleorintention,becausetheultimate\nepistemologicalgoalistoreachareasonedjudgment,thenor-\nmative structure of the practice necessitates inquiry and thus\nthe various virtues. For example, even if one begins with the\nintention to persuade, if the persuasion is to be rational, then\none must care about truth and accuracy, be willing to put\none\u2019sargumentstothetestofreasonandfollowthearguments\nwhere they lead, be willing to concede to the most defensible\nposition, etc. (Bailin and Battersby 2009). In other words, one\nmust exhibit the virtues of inquiry.\n3. FOSTERING THE VIRTUES OF INQUIRY\n3.1.Immersion in the practice\nAccording to many accounts, then, critical thinking is seen\nto involve two related, but conceptually distinct aspects: skills\nanddispositions.Theproblemswiththenotionofdisposition\nhasalreadybeendiscussed.Buteventhenotionofskillscanbe\nproblematic if it is seen to refer to some inner mental entity.\nCritical thinking is skilled thinking in the sense that it meets\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 331 certain criteria, and there do not seem to be any grounds,\neither empirical or conceptual, for positing a connection\nbetween the quality of thinking and any putative mental enti-\nties or processes (Bailin et al. 1999a, b).\nEven if skill is not used to refer to mental entities but only\nto indicate skilled performance, nonetheless conceptualizing\ncritical thinking in terms two distinct and discrete aspects\ngives rise to other problems. It is clearly possible to improve\nstudents\u2019 performance in discrete critical thinking tasks (e.g.,\ndiagramming arguments, recognizing fallacies, etc.). There is\nconsiderableevidence,however,thatthe\u201cdisposition\u201dtoapply\nthese \u201cskills\u201d in other contexts does not necessarily follow,\nnor do the particular critical thinking virtues (Facione 2000,\nBehar-Horenstein and Niu 2011). Bowell and Kingsbury\n(2014) describe the problem thus:\nCritical thinking teaching is beset by what is often called \u201cthe\ntransfer problem\u201d: it is difficult to get students to use their crit-\nical thinking skills in their other studies and in their everyday\nlives (2).\nViewing the issue of how to foster the virtues of critical\nthinkingintermsoftransferassumes1)thattherearediscrete\ncritical thinking skills which can be learned out of context (or\ninonecontext)andthentransferredtoanothercontext,and2)\nthatwhetherornotoneachievestransferisaquestionofmoti-\nvation and/or perception, which can be examined separately\nfrom the issue of skill acquisition.\nWe would argue that this dualistic way of conceptualizing\ncritical thinking is faulty at its core (Bailin et al. 1999a). We\nwould argue instead for a conception of critical thinking as a\npractice\u2013thepracticeofinquiry.Inthepracticeofinquiry,the\nachievementofskilledperformanceandtheacquisitionofthe\nvirtues inherent in the practice are intimately intertwined.\nWhat exactly do we mean by a practice? Here we draw on\nMacIntyre\u2019s notion of a practice, which he characterizes thus:\n332MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN By a \u201cpractice\u201d I am going to mean any coherent and complex\nformofsociallyestablished cooperativehumanactivitythrough\nwhich goods internal to that form of activity are realized in the\ncourse of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which\nareappropriateto,andpartiallydefinitiveof,thatformofactiv-\nity,withtheresultthathumanpowerstoachieveexcellence,and\nhumanconceptionsoftheendsandgoodsinvolved,aresystem-\natically extended (MacIntyre 1996, p.187).\nThere has been some debate as to whether argumentation\nqualifies as a practice. Although argumentation exhibits most\nof the features of a practice, it has been argued that there\narelimitations withrespecttotheapplicability ofMacIntyre\u2019s\nparticular characterization to argumentation (Kvernbekk\n2008). As Kvernbekk has pointed out, although some of the\ngoods of argumentation are internal to the practice of argu-\nmentation, not all are. We do sometimes argue for the sake of\nengaging in argumentation (Cohen 2012), but we more often\nargue for other reasons \u2013 to persuade, to justify, to make a\ndecision. We would, however, also agree with Kvernbekk, cit-\ning Miller (1994), that not all practices are self-contained, as\nMacIntyre\u2019s conception implies. There are some practices\nwhich exist to serve some end beyond themselves \u2013 what\nMiller calls purposive practices. Argumentation (or critical\nthinking) can thus be seen as a purposive practice, with goods\nboth internal and external to it. This seems very similar to\nCohen\u2019s notion of argumentation as a tradition (Cohen 2012).\nThepracticeofinquiryisessentiallyacriticalpractice,char-\nacterized by the give and take of reasons and arguments with\nthe goal of reaching a reasoned judgment. It is a practice con-\nstitutedbyawebofinterconnectedconcepts(e.g.,reasons,evi-\ndence, argument, justification, premise, conclusion, opinion)\nwhich are connected, in turn, to certain principles and pro-\ncedures, and all the preceding are connected to the goal of\nreachingareasonedjudgment(Bailin1999).Inquiryisinstan-\ntiated in a number of different particular practices, e.g., pol-\nitics, ethics, science, law, the arts, which involve a diversity\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 333 of concepts, principles, procedures and specific purposes. But\nwhatthesepracticeshaveincommonisthattheyareallcritical\npractices. Whatever else they may involve, they also impor-\ntantly involve the evaluating of reasons, the justifying of\nclaims, and the making of judgments (Bailin 1999).\nLearning tothinkcritically,then,isnotamatteroflearning\na number of discrete skills (the approach typically taken in\ntraditional criticalthinking courses)and,additionally,picking\nup certain dispositions in the process. Rather, it is a matter\nof learning to participate knowledgeably and competently in\nthe practice of inquiry in its various forms and contexts. And\nacquiring the virtues of inquiry arises through getting on the\ninside of the practice and coming to appreciate the goods\ninherent in the practice. The willingness to abide by its nor-\nmative constraints comes through sharing in the constitutive\npurposes. Someone exhibiting the virtues of inquiry evaluates\nopposing views in a fair and open-minded manner because\nshe understands that such a weighing is what is called for in\norder to reach a reasoned judgment; she is willing to concede\nto the most defensible position because she understands that\nher own view could be mistaken (Bailin and Battersby 2009).\nImmersion in the practice of inquiry does not, however,\nimply simply teaching the disciplines in the traditional man-\nner.Traditionaldisciplinaryteachinghashadnotoriouslylim-\nited success in fostering critical thinking (Hestenes, Wells and\nSwackhamer1992;Jungwirth1987;FerraroandTaylor2005).\nThisisnotsurprisinggiventhatreasoningandargumentation\nare seldom a focus of disciplinary pedagogy. The nature of\ninquiry and how it is instantiated in the particular area is sel-\ndom made explicit (Bailin and Battersby 2015). And any focus\non the virtues of inquiry is, in general, notably absent.4\nWhat is required instead, is an immersion in the practice\nwhich brings to the fore the goals, principles, and underlying\n4.A notable exception appears to be graduate education, particularly in science, where foster-\ning the spirit of inquiry is a frequent goal and achievement.\n334MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN structure of inquiry, both in general and within the particular\ncontext, and makes explicit its modes of argumentation,\nmethodologies, and normative constraints (Bailin and Bat-\ntersby 2016; Battersby and Bailin 2015). With such an\napproach,thevirtuesofinquiryarepartandparceloflearning\ntoinquireasparticipantscometounderstandthatsuchvirtues\nare embedded in and required by the practice of inquiry. In\norder to achieve this, however, an appropriate context for\ninquiry mustbecreatedinwhichvirtues arehighlighted, pro-\nmoted, and expected (Case and Balcaen 2008).\n3.2. Creating a community of inquiry\nThe practice of inquiry is at its core a communal, social\npractice. Cohen (2014) makes the point thus:\nArguingwouldhavetobeawayofparticipatinginthecommu-\nnity.Ifarguingistobepartofatradition,itcannotbeaboutwho\nIamorwhatIdo;it\u2019saboutwhoweareandwhatwedo.Weargue\nwithone another, not in isolation (p.4).\nThusthepracticeofinquiryrequiresbeingapartofandtak-\ning part in a community in which people can argue with one\nanother, that is, a community of inquiry (Dewey 1938, Lip-\nman 2003). Communities of inquiry are central to our vari-\nouscollectivecriticalpursuits,andtheyareparticularlycentral\nto democratic deliberation (Dewey 1938, Aikens and Clanton\n2010).\nA community of inquiry is not just a community in which\npeople argue with each other, however. It is a community in\nwhich they do it in a way which instantiates the virtues of\ninquiry. Cohen again:\nObviously,somethingmoreisneededtomakelogicalinferences\ninto dynamic, vital arguments capable of centering a tradition.\nAnd that something more is arguing with others. But even that\nisnotenough,otherwisebeingexcessivelyargumentativewould\nmake one a pillar of the community! What\u2019s needed is not just\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 335 arguing with others, but doing it well, that is, virtuously (Cohen\n2014, p.4).\nA community of inquiry is a community which has as its\naim rational inquiry and reasoned judgment. And it is a com-\nmunitywhichischaracterizedbycertainsortsofrelationships\nand interactions, i.e., by open-minded and fair-minded\nexchanges, by rigorous but respectful critique, and by a com-\nmitment to respectful treatment, meaningful participation,\nand productive interaction (Bailin and Battersby 2016).5 The\ncharacteroftheserelationshipsplaysacentralroleinfostering\nthe virtues of inquiry.\nVirtues are flexible aspects of character, related to our sense of\nselfandintegrity,butalsofosteredandencouragedbythecom-\nmunities and relations with others that provide the context in\nwhich we decide and act (Burbules 1995, p.86).\nAnd further:\nthey[virtues]cannotbeanalyzedsolelyasindividualpossessions:\npersons acquire, maintain, and express the virtues that they do\npartlybecauseoftherelationstheyhavetoothers,andhowthose\nothers act in response to them (Burbules 1995, p.86).\n3.3. The practice of inquiry in the classroom\nWhat does an inquiry approach mean for how we go about\nteaching? It means, first, that an immersion in the practice of\ninquiryneedstobethefocusofclassroomactivity.Second,the\nsetting, structure, and relationships of the classroom need to\ninstantiatethecharacteristicsofacommunityofinquiry.How\ncanthesefeaturesbeinstantiatedintoactualpedagogicalprac-\ntices?\nThismaybebestillustratedbycontrastinganinquiryclass-\n5.Aikens and Clanton (2010) argue that there are characteristics of individual deliberators\n(group deliberative virtues) that can help to foster virtuous deliberation, including delibera-\ntive wit, friendliness, empathy, charity, temperance, courage, sincerity, and humility.\n336MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN room with traditional classroom structures and activities. For\nexample, in a traditional critical thinking class, the focus of\nactivityisgenerallyonlearningandpracticingdiscrete\u201cskills,\u201d\nforexample,identifyingthestructureofarguments,argument\ndiagramming, identifying fallacies. Although there may be\nsomegroupwork,theonusandfocusisgenerallyontheindi-\nvidual student and not on student interactions. Assessment is\ngenerally summative, i.e., the awarding of grades at the end of\nanactivityorunitforthepurposesofsummarizingastudent\u2019s\nproficiency.\nAn inquiry orientation will dictate a very different sort of\nclassroom. The focus is not on micro-skills or decontextual-\nized arguments. Rather students engage in the actual enter-\nprise of inquiry, learning to come to reasoned judgments on\ncomplexissues.Intheprocess,thecriteriaandmodesofargu-\nmentation,bothgeneralandwithinspecificareas,arebrought\ntotheforeandmadeexplicit.Thetextbookwehavepublished\nincludes an examination of issues such as capital punishment,\nthe minimum wage, the legalization of marijuana, the effects\nof violent video games, polygamy, and the interpretation of a\nchallenging work of art (Bailin and Battersby 2016). Students\nlearntheprocessofinquiryandworkthroughthecriteriaand\nmodes of argumentation relevant to the particular issue, then\ngo on to conduct inquiries on issues of interest to them, both\nindividually and in groups.\nAn inquiry classroom will instantiate the features of a com-\nmunity of inquiry. Student interaction is central. Students\nargue,question,challenge,andcritique.Theyalsoandcontin-\nually engage in collaborative activities, providing feedback on\neachother\u2019swork,workingonjointprojects,anddoingcollab-\norativeinquiries.Thistypeofcollaborationissignificantlydif-\nferent from much group work undertaken in educational set-\ntings.Thelattertendstoinvolveadivisionoflabor,witheach\nstudent preparing a different piece of the project, then assem-\nblingthepartsattheend.Theformer,ontheotherhand,con-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 337 sists in collaborative thinking, involving students discussing\nideas, developing criteria, critiquing each other\u2019s work, ques-\ntioning assumptions, and building on the ideas of their peers.\nThecommunitycreatedintheclassroomwillbecharacterized\nby the sorts of relationships and interactions described above,\ni.e., open-minded and fair-minded exchanges, rigorous but\nrespectfulcritique,andacommitmenttorespectfultreatment,\nmeaningful participation, and productive interaction (Bailin\nand Battersby 2016). These attitudes or habits of mind can\nbe fostered through instructor modeling and the setting up of\nexplicit expectations among students and between instructor\nand students.\nIt might be objected that arguers may assume a variety of\nroles, including proponent or opponent, judges or spectators\n(Cohen 2013), and that each of these roles may require or\nemphasize different virtues. So if one is a defense lawyer,\nopen-mindedness will not be the salient virtue required but\nrather an unrelenting pursuit of the weaknesses in the argu-\nments of others. And in group deliberation, sometimes the\nperson who doggedly maintains her position despite counter-\nargumentsplaysausefulroleinensuringthatalternativeargu-\nments are given due consideration. Nonetheless in multi-role\nargumentation,argumentshavetobeputforward,understood\nand elaborated, defended, criticized, revised, and evaluated.\nThus the virtues related to the various roles would have to be\nrepresented among the group in order for effective deliber-\nation to take place. Individuals would also need to be profi-\ncient in taking on the various roles depending on the context\n(Radziewsky 2014). Indeed, with an inquiry approach, there\nis usually not a sharp differentiation among the various roles.\nRather, individuals alternate between proposing, critiquing,\ndefending, revising and evaluating. Moreover, the context we\nareconsideringhereiseducation,andaseducatorswehavean\nobligation to promote the full range of virtues in all our stu-\ndents.\n338MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN For inquiry to flourish, one needs assessment practices\nwhich are consonant with an inquiry orientation, practices\nwhich value the activities, achievements, and virtues of\ninquiry. If what one is looking for is critical thinking, then\nonehas toassess forcritical thinking andnotjustforcontent.\nMoreover, assessment can have an important pedagogical\nfunction. Too often the only or primary form of assessment is\nsummative.

An inquiry classroom is one characterized by ongoing\ninstructor and peer feedback and continual revision.\nDespite our best efforts to foster the virtues of inquiry, there\nare certain common human attitudes and reactions which are\ncounter-productive to inquiry and which are often reinforced\nin social contexts. Some examples are the need to be right, the\ndesire for certainty, the identification with our beliefs, defen-\nsiveness, and groupthink (Bailin and Battersby 2016, pp.267 \u2013\n272;BattersbyandBailin2014). Anotheraspectofacquiring the\nvirtues of inquiry, then, involves becoming aware of these cog-\nnitive and emotional obstacles which can hamper inquiry, and\ninstituting measures to avoid them or at least lessen their influ-\nence.Onewaytodothisistomonitorone\u2019sowninquiryprocess,\nasking oneself questions such as: \u201cAre my preconceptions and\ninitialperspectivesbiasinghowIevaluatethisissue?\u201d\u201cAmIseri-\nouslyconsideringotherviewsandarguments?\u201d\u201cAmIbeingopen\nto criticism?\u201d \u201cAm I identifying with being a reasonable person\nrather than with a particular point of view?\u201d (Bailin and Bat-\ntersby 2016, pp.273 \u2013 275).

Requiring students to\nlay out and evaluate various sides of an issue as an integral part\nof the inquiry process is one example. Having students come up\nwith the best arguments they can for a position that it is the\nopposite of what they believe is another.678\nAnotherimportantconsiderationintryingtopromoteinquiry\nanditsvirtuesismotivation(Facione2000).Akeyconceptwhich\nrunsthroughthecognitivebiasliteratureisthatofmentaleffort\n(Kahneman 2010, pp.39 \u2013 49). Thinking critically and engaging\ninseriousinquiryrequiresmentalwork,andmuchofthislitera-\ntureseems toindicate thatpeopleareoftennotinitiallyinclined\nto put in this effort. Kahneman has argued that this failure is\ndue,inleastinpart,toinsufficientmotivation.HereMacIntyre\u2019s\nnotion of seeing the point of a practice is relevant. A significant\npart of the motivation to engage in inquiry comes through get-\ntingontheinsideofthepracticeandcomingtoappreciatingthe\ngoods inherent in it (Bailin and Battersby 2007).\nBut inquiry is also a purposive practice which enables one\ntoinvestigatecomplexissuesinarigorousway.Thediscovery\non the part of students that they can tackle real issues which\naremeaningful andofinterest tothem, andthatthey havethe\nmeans to think their way through them and make reasoned\njudgments can be significantly empowering and motivating.\n6.Zenker (2014) describes a teaching and learning activity for this purpose involving what he\ncalls \u201ccounterfactual meta-cognition\u201d (engaging in reasoning episodes that one does not\nagree with personally).\n7.Another strategy is a U-shaped debate. in which students are encouraged to physically\nchange their position around a semi-circle as they hear reasons from their peers that cause\nthem to want to shift their view on the issue under discussion. For a more complete\ndescription of the process, see University of British Columbia (2014).\n8.Structured controversy, in which students argue for both sides of a controversial issue and\nultimately come up with a balanced view, is yet another example (see Johnson and Johnson\n1988).\n340MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN 4. CONCLUSION\nThere is widespread agreement that fostering the virtues\nof critical thinking is central to a rational community and a\ndemocratic society. Our argument is that a serious commit-\nmenttofosteringthesevirtuesrequiresthinkingaboutcritical\nthinking differently and taking our conception into the class-\nroom. Argumentation theorists tend to have a real interest in\neducation and have devoted a great deal of attention to the\ncontent of courses in critical thinking.

OR, WHERE DO\nSPARKLING NEW IDEAS COME FROM?\nSharon Bailin\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIn his review of the book, Rorty and His Critics (Brandom\n2000), Simon Blackburn makes the following observation:\nRorty denies that philosophical progress comes about through\nargument.Asherightlyremindsus,argumentrequirespremises\nand conclusions that belong to the same conceptual family [or\nfield]. Argument, it follows, is for conservatives. And real\nprogress,bycontrast,means\u2018offeringussparklingnewideasor\nutopianvisionsofgloriousnewinstitutions,\u2019disabusingusofold\nroutes of inference and feeling, enabling us to forget where we\nonce were. It does not mean anything so flat as mere argument\n(2001, p.39).\nThe job of coming up with these sparkling new ideas, of\nproposing new vocabularies, of changing the world, falls to\nthe \u201cstrong poet.\u201d The role to which those of us engaged in\nargumentation are relegated seems to be that of the account-\ning clerk, fitted with visor and sleeve protectors, scrutinizing\nthe ledger book of ideas, making sure that the books balance\nand that no calculation errors have been made.\nIwouldventuretosaythatmany,perhapsmostofuswork-\ning in the areas of argumentation theory, Informal Logic and\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 347 critical thinking like to think of the practice to which we are\ncommitted as progressive, as contributing to social better-\nment and intellectual advancement. We may prefer to imag-\nine ourselves out toiling in those conceptual fields, boots\nimmersed in the muddy waters, planting and grafting as well\nas pruning and weeding, and perhaps even harvesting a crop\nfrom time to time. I suspect that most of us, whatever our\npolitical stripe, would resist the idea that we are confined by\nthe very nature of our disciplinary practice, to simply uphold\nand perhaps rearrange the status quo, either intellectually or\npolitically. But this is the picture that Rorty paints. In this\npaperIwanttolookatwhetherheisright.Cansparklingnew\nideas arise from argument?\n2. RORTY\u2019S VIEW\nLet me begin by briefly rehearsing those aspects of Rorty\u2019s\nbroaderpositionthatframehisviewsaboutargument.Acen-\ntral aspect is that it is anti-foundational. He denies the pos-\nsibility of absolute, certain foundations for knowledge and\ninstead claims that justification is to be sought within human\npractices.Suchjustificationis,moreover,limitedtoparticular\npractices,languagegames,orvocabulariesbutmakesnosense\nbetween vocabularies. Argument cannot, then, adjudicate\nbetween vocabularies. And even the standards and principles\nthat guide evaluation have no normative force but are simply\nwaysofdescribingthepractice.Tothinkotherwiseistocom-\nmit the fallacy of \u201cseeing axioms where there are only shared\nhabits, or viewing statements which summarize such prac-\ntices as if they reported constraints enforcing such practices\u201d\n(Rorty 1991, p.26).\nConsistentwiththisposition,Rortymaintainsthatthekind\nofphilosophythatheisdoingandadvocatingdoesnotinvolve\nputtingfortharguments.Hedeniesthatheisplayingthegame\nof rational discussion but claims, rather, to be engaged in a\ndifferent practice which he describes thus:\n348MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN It [the new method of philosophy] does not pretend to have\na better candidate for doing the same old thing which we did\nwhenwespokeintheoldway.Rather,itsuggeststhatwemight\nwant to stop doing those things and do something else. But it\ndoesnotargueforthissuggestiononthebasisofantecedentcri-\nteria common to the old and the new language game. For just\ninsofarasthenewlanguagegamereallyisnew,therewillbeno\nsuch criteria (Rorty 1989, p.9).\nHe describes the practice in which he is engaged as\n\u201credescribing,\u201d and states that the aim is to make such\nredescription attractive so that people will begin to adopt the\nnew vocabulary. Moreover it is this process of adopting new\nvocabulariesonthebasisoftheiraestheticappealandnotthat\nof rational choice of alternatives based on argument which\neffects changes in the culture.\n3. INTELLECTUAL INNOVATION\nI have described Rorty\u2019s view not primarily with the aim\nof engaging in Rortyan exegesis per se, but rather in order\nto highlight certain features of the position and bring out the\nmore general picture of intellectual innovation on which his\nview of argument rests.\nOne central feature that marks innovation for Rorty is dis-\ncontinuity. Innovative ideas exhibit a radical sort of novelty.\nTheyarenotsimplycontinuations andextensions ofthepre-\nvious vocabulary but are characterized by a complete break\nwith what has come before. And because of this lack of con-\ntinuity, new vocabularies are incommensurable with those\nthey have superseded. This incommensurability means that\nthe innovation cannot be evaluated in terms of the criteria\nthat governed the previous vocabulary.\nAnother feature of the Rortyan view of innovation is that\nit draws a radical distinction between the generation and the\nevaluation or criticism of ideas. The activity of criticism (or\nargument)isseenasrule-boundandrigid,constrainedbythe\nlogic of the particular framework or vocabulary. Innovative\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 349 ideasareradicallynewinthesensethattheybreakfreeofthis\nlogic. Thus they cannot arise in the context of the applica-\ntion of evaluative criteria of the previous framework \u2014 these\ncriteria would keep one trapped within the old framework.\nNew ideas cannot be a product of a logical process of incre-\nmental alteration of antecedent ideas and views. The gener-\nation of innovative ideas must be, in some sense, non-logical\nandunconstrained.Generationandcriticismareseen,thus,as\nqualitatively different and even opposed sorts of activities.\nStatedthus, itbecomes clear thatRorty\u2019sisbutoneversion\nof a view about creativity that appears, and has appeared his-\ntorically,inmanycontextsandguises.Amongitsmostpromi-\nnent proponents were the Romantics. Reacting against the\nrationalism of the Enlightenment and the classical emphasis\non tradition, the Romantic poets and theorists glorified the\nimaginationandviewedtheartsnotasimitationbutasbring-\ning something new into the world. Coleridge, in particular,\nhighlighted the role of the creative imagination in producing\nsomethingnewandunprecedented,therebytransformingthe\nartist into a God-like creator (Taylor 1989). Such a feat could\nnot be the result of traditional rules or patterns. It was\nthoughttobe,rather,theproductofpoeticinspiration,which\ndiffers from ordinary ideation in that it is sudden, effortless\nand unanticipated. Abrams (1953, p.189) describes it thus:\n\u201cThepoemorpassagespringstocompletionallatonce,with-\noutthepriorintentionofthepoet,andwithoutthatprocessof\nconsidering, rejecting, and selecting alternatives which ordi-\nnarilyintervenebetweentheintentionsandtheachievement\u201d\n(inotherwords,withoutcriticaljudgment).Poeticinspiration\nis the province of the creative genius. We can recognize the\ngenius because there is \u201cno mechanism in him or his work,\nnothing that can be analyzed and rationalized\u201d (Barzun,\np.475). The genius creates \u201cwithout precedent either in con-\ncrete example or in codified precepts and rules\u201d (Barzun,\np.195). Originality is the hallmark of artistic creation for the\n350MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Romantics and the genius is the originator par excellence. The\nRomantics believed that, in creating beauty, the artist also\nrevealed truth; as a consequence they had great faith in the\npower of the creative genius to change the world. Poets,\naccording to Shelley, are \u201cthe unacknowledged legislators of\ntheworld\u201d(quotedinBarzun,p.474).Whatwehave,then,isa\npicture of a special sort of individual who, through an act of\nimagination, creates an original, artistic vision, a vision that\nis unanticipated, unprecedented and not the result of tradi-\ntional rules or critical judgment, but a vision that can change\nthe world. This is the Romantic creative genius \u2014 or Rorty\u2019s\nstrong poet.\nAlthoughtheRomanticviewfocusedonthearts,thepicture\nof innovation that it elaborated has been extended into other\nareas as well, including scientific discovery. An influential\nversion is that of Thomas Kuhn (1962) in his distinction\nbetween normal science and revolutionary science. Normal\nscience, the mainstay of scientific activity, takes place in the\ncontextofafixedparadigmwhichguidesresearch,specifying\nthe problems to be undertaken and the procedures, rules and\ncriteria to be used in investigating these problems. Normal\nscientific activity isuncritical oftheassumptions ofthepara-\ndigm. Revolutionary science, on the other hand, is character-\nized by a radical departure from the prevailing paradigm and\nthe creation of a completely new one. This new paradigm is\nnot a logical continuation of the previous one, but involves a\nnew way of viewing phenomena and is, thus, incommensu-\nrable with the old paradigm. Since criteria of evaluation are\napplicable only within paradigms, there can be no paradigm-\nneutral criteria according to which to choose between para-\ndigms.Thustheacceptanceofanewparadigmisnotmadeon\nthe basis of rational evaluation but can only be a type of con-\nversion or gestalt switch. The parallels between Kuhn\u2019s view\noftheorychangeinscienceandtheviewofinnovationoffered\nby Rorty are very strong.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 351 AnotheraspectoftheRomanticviewofinnovationapplied\nto science can be seen in the theories of Paul Feyerabend\n(1975). Feyerabend denies that there are any rules of method\nthatareconsistentandinvariablewithrespecttoallscientific\npractice. This is not a descriptive claim about poor scientific\npractice, however. Rather, he is making the claim that there\ncould not be such rules, that the adherence to any invariable\nrules of method would be detrimental to scientific progress\nbecause they would keep one locked into the presuppositions\nofanexistingtheory.Theonlywayinwhichtheholdofapre-\nvailing theory can be broken is by the positing of an entirely\nnew theory, unconnected with the old one. The only method\nhe accepts for scientific discovery is \u201canything goes.\u201d\nAnd even Karl Popper, although disagreeing with Feyer-\nabend\u2019s claims regarding the impossibility of rules of method\nfor the evaluation of theories, holds strongly to a discovery/\njustification distinction and relegates discovery to the realm\nof the irrational.\n[M]yviewofthematter,forwhatitisworth,isthatthereisno\nsuch thing as a logical method of having new ideas, or a logi-\ncalreconstructionofthisprocess.Myviewmaybeexpressedby\nsaying that every discovery contains \u201can irrational element,\u201d or\n\u201ca creative intuition,\u201d in Bergson\u2019s sense (1959, p.32).\nAspects of this Romantic view of creativity have also thor-\noughly permeated popular consciousness, but in a somewhat\ndemocratized form. There is common acceptance of the idea\nthatinnovationsareradicallynewandthatamodeofthinking\ndifferent from everyday logic is required to generate new\nideas. One popular example is Edward de Bono\u2019s (1970) con-\nceptoflateralthinking.Incontrasttoverticalthinking,which\nis logical, evaluative and involves remaining rigidly within a\nframework, lateral thinking is strictly generative, producing\nnew ideas without judging them, defying the logic of the\nframework, and making new connections between disparate\nelements.\n352MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN One difference between the Romantic view of innovation\nand this contemporary popular version is that this special\nmode of creative thinking is no longer thought to be the\nexclusive purview of the genius. Rather, it can be learned and\nso is, in principle, open to everyone. Hence the plethora of\ncreativity self-help books and do-it-yourself creativity videos\nwith evocative titles such as A Knock on the Side of the Head\nand A Kick in the Seat of the Pants, that offer suggestions for\n\u201cbreaking set\u201d and \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d (my favourite is\nthe video guaranteeing to make you more creative in 30 days\nor your money back). Such materials warn of the dangers of\ntoomuchlogic;suggesttechniquessuchasvisualization,stim-\nulating thinking with random information, and brainstorm-\ning(i.e.,generatingwithoutjudging);andofferadvicesuchas:\nbreak the rules, unlearn what you know, follow your dreams,\nand consult a fool (von Oech 1986, 1993; Adams 1986).\nOne conclusion that can be drawn from this quick march\nthroughtheoriesofcreativityisthatRorty\u2019sviewhasahistory\nandislinkedtoatraditionofthinkingaboutissuesregarding\nthe nature and source of innovation and the role of logic\nand argument therein. It is not a new idea. The question still\nremains, is it sparkling?\n4. CRITIQUE\nIbelievethatthereareseriousproblemswithRorty\u2019sview\nof innovation and of argument and that these significantly\ndetract from the lustre of his idea.\n4.1. Discontinuity\nFirst,theclaimregardingthediscontinuitybetweenvocab-\nularies/paradigms/frameworks is problematic both concep-\ntually and empirically. On the conceptual front, the problem\nis that comprehension seems to presuppose continuity. If a\nnewideaorpracticeemergedwhichweretotallyunconnected\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 353 with any human traditions and practices, we would not be\nable to understand it. It is connections to what is familiar\nthat render innovations comprehensible and give us grounds\nfor seeing them as innovations as opposed to merely being\nstrange. Innovations arise in the context of an enterprise that\nhasahistory andispartofatradition, andthetradition hasa\ndirection, goals and meaning in light of which originality can\nbe recognized.1\nThe discontinuity thesis also faces problems on the empir-\nical front in that a close analysis of actual cases of innovation\nseemsregularlytorevealcontinuitiesbetweennewworksand\nthe previous traditions. The arts represent the model of cre-\nation for the Romantics, and to some extent for Rorty, yet\neven here connections to the problems, methods and tech-\nniques of the tradition seem always to be in evidence. A rad-\nical innovation such as Picasso\u2019s cubism, for example, can\nbe seen as an attempt to grapple with a specifically artistic\nproblem \u2013 the simultaneous portrayal of multiple perspec-\ntives. Moreover the continuity with the work of earlier and\ncontemporary artists such as C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, Derain and\nDelacroix, and the influences of Iberian sculpture and non-\nEuropean art are very clear.\nSuchcontinuitiesareevidentinscienceaswell.Numerous\nhistorians and philosophers of science have pointed out the\nconceptualandmethodologicalcontinuitiesbetweensucces-\nsivetheories andhavedemonstrated thatevenscientific dis-\ncoveries that may appear revolutionary have their roots in\nthe problems and theories of previous paradigms. Hattian-\ngadi(1980),forexample,describesNewton\u2019sdevelopmentof\nthe law of gravitation in terms of entirely logical physical\nand mathematical arguments. Brown (1977) illustrates how\nEinstein\u2019s theoretical innovations arose from his arguments\nagainstexistingtheoriesandtookastheirpointofdeparture\n1.This discussion of discontinuity is taken from Bailin 1992a.\n354MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN some of the ideas of the rejected hypotheses. And Toulmin\n(1972)demonstratesthatneitherthechangeoverfromNew-\ntonian to Einsteinian physics nor the \u201cCopernican revolu-\ntion\u201d were characterized by the kind of complete rational\ndiscontinuitythatKuhnsuggests.Rather,thesechangeswere\ngradual and there is clear evidence that they were \u201cargued\nevery step of the way\u201d (p.105). He points out, for example,\nthat the testimony of the physicists who switched from a\nclassical to a relativistic position shows no evidence of an\nintellectual conversion. Rather \u201cthey presented the argu-\nmentsthatsanctionedtheirchangeoftheoreticalstandpoint\u201d\n(p.104).Similarly,Kuhn\u2019sownhistoricalaccountmakesclear\nthatthe\u201cCopernicanRevolution\u201dtookacenturyandahalfto\ncompleteandwastheoutcomeofrationaldiscussion(p.105).\nToulmin summarizes thus:\nWemustfacethefactthatparadigm-switchesareneverascom-\nplete as the fully-fledged definition implies; that rival para-\ndigms never really amount to entire alternative world-views,\nand that intellectual discontinuities on the theoretical level of\nscience conceal underlying continuities at a deeper, method-\nological level (pp.105-106).\nIt may be that some changes in traditions appear so radical\nbecausewetendtoviewthemfromadistance.Acloseranaly-\nsis may be required to see the continuities. Indeed, this is\nthe conclusion of Miller\u2019s (1984) historical study document-\ning the gradual development of the new quantum theories in\nthe early twentieth century:\nThe notion of scientific revolutions describes only the gross\nstructure of scientific change. In the fine structure, where\nchangeisgradual,residesthefascinatingproblemofthenature\nof creative scientific thinking (p.301).\nThe realm of social and philosophical innovation seems to\nbe of particular interest to Rorty, but here too continuities to\npast thought are everywhere in evidence. The types of inno-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 355 vations that might be thought to manifest progress have built\nupon, as opposed to completely overturning, previous social\nandphilosophicalideas(Bailin1992c).Theinsightsofcritical\ntheory, for example, can be traced back through Marx to\nHegelian dialectic, and many feminist theories are rooted in\nprevious Marxist and liberal philosophies. The critical theo-\nristHenriGiroux(1991,pp.2-3)acknowledgesthiscontinuity\nthus:\nModernismprovidestheoreticalelementsforanalyzingboththe\nlimitsofitsownhistoricaltraditionandfordevelopingapolit-\nical standpoint in which the breadth and specificity of democ-\nraticstrugglescanbeexpandedthroughthemodernistidealsof\nfreedom, justice, and equality.\nSandra Harding (1990) makes a similar point with respect\nto feminist theory:\nHowever a specifically feminist alternative to Enlightenment\nprojectsmaydevelop,itisnotclearhowitcouldcompletelytake\nleave of Enlightenment assumptions and still remain feminist.\nThe critics are right that feminism (also) stands on Enlighten-\nment ground (p.99).\nThe discontinuity thesis is a crucial supporting plank in\nRorty\u2019s view about the origins of innovation, but it cannot\nbear the weight of close scrutiny.\n4.2. Generation and Evaluation\nLet me turn, then, to the other main plank of his view,\nthe opposition between the generation and the criticism of\nideas. To recap, the principle idea is that the activity of criti-\ncism, which is the realm of argument, is confined within the\nbounds of particular frameworks (paradigms or vocabular-\nies).Itisnot,however,possiblebetweenframeworksbecause\nallcriteriaofevaluationareframework-specific.Forthisrea-\nson, the generation of new ideas cannot be the product of\nan evaluative process. Rather, it is a creative process involv-\n356MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN ingimagination,inspirationanda-rationalleaps.Generation\nand criticism are distinct and mutually exclusive kinds of\nthinking.\nThere are problems here as well. First, I think that this\nopposition is lent plausibility by the discontinuity thesis. If\ninnovationreallywerediscontinuous withpast frameworks,\nthen it might appear that the kind of thinking applicable\nwithin the framework could not lead to the transcending of\nthe framework. Conceptual change might seem to require\nexplanation in terms of a special kind of thinking. Once it\nis recognized, however, that there are continuities between\nframeworks and that some of the criteria of evaluation will\nremain intact, then a motivating reason for positing such a\ndichotomy disappears.\n4.2.1. Generation as Critical\nWhatoftheclaim thatthegeneration ofnewideas cannot\nbe the product of an evaluative process, in other words that\ngeneration is uncritical? It is important to note that what is\nof interest here is originality, not mere novelty. The genera-\ntion of novelty is easy. Any random word or bizarre act may\nbe new. What is at issue are new ideas that are effective or\nvaluable, that meet a need or solve a problem, that are sig-\nnificant in the context of a domain \u2014 new ideas that con-\ntribute to progress, new ideas that sparkle. And it seems\nclear that the generation of such ideas must involve critical\njudgment and evaluation. Critical judgment is required in\nthe initial identification of some phenomena as in need of\nexploration or explanation. Recognizing the inadequacies in\ncurrent approaches and deciding that a new approach is\nrequired are also aspects of generation that involve critical\nevaluation. And determining potentially fruitful directions\nfor exploration or investigation and recognizing possible\nsolutions or satisfactory outcomes are products of judgment\nas well. The generation of effective new ideas must be con-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 357 strained by critical criteria. If it were not, the results would\nbe chaos not creation. Not all assumptions, criteria and\nmethods can be overturned. Some elements of the previous\nframework must remain, elements in the light of which the\nnew idea takes on meaning and significance.2\nThus I would argue that the criteria of critical appraisal\ndo not have to be discarded in order to transcend some of\ntheassumptionsofthecurrentframework.Rather,oneisled\ntoquestioncurrentassumptionsinthelightofone\u2019sreason-\ningabouttheproblemorreflectiononthesituation.Itwould\nseem, then, that becoming entrenched in one way to view a\nproblem is not a case of being trapped by the critical proce-\ndures of the tradition as Feyerabend, among others, would\nclaim, but is, rather, a failure to be sufficiently critical.\nThe idea that the generation of new ideas is uncritical\nalso rests on a particular view of the nature of the frame-\nworks within which critical thinking operates. Frameworks\nseem to be conceived of as rigidly bounded and highly rule-\ngoverned, with all the information for making judgments\ncontained within the framework. Yet there are only a very\nlimited number of cases in which we operate within such\nclear-cut, clearly defined, and rigidly bounded frameworks\n(formal logic or the game of chess might be examples). In\nmost instances of problem-solving and creation, however,\nframeworks overlap, shift and have indefinite boundaries.\nMoreoverrelevantconsiderationsmayemanatefromavari-\nety of perspectives or frames of reference (Bailin 1992a).\nGiven the above, there is no need to posit non-rational,\nimaginative leaps to explain the generation of new ideas.\nGoingbeyondtheinformationgivenis,rather,afeatureofall\nour intelligent thought and behaviour and does not require\nspecialexplanation.Anumberofpsychologistshavepointed\nout the incremental nature of thinking that leads to inno-\n2.This discussion of generation as critical draws heavily on Bailin 1992.\n358MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN vation and have demonstrated how ordinary processes such\nas noticing, recognizing, searching, remembering, and eval-\nuating can,together,contribute tocreativeresults (Weisberg\n1993; Perkins 1981). This is not to deny the reality of the\nfeeling of insight we often experience when getting an idea\nor solving a problem. It is to deny only that such a feeling\nis an accurate indication that an a-rational leap has actually\ntaken place.\nIn suggesting a role for critical judgment in innovation, it\nmay appear that I am rejecting the well-known distinction\nin philosophy of science between discovery and justification\nand arguing for a logic of discovery. That is not entirely\nthe case, however. The discovery/justification distinction is\nmeant to suggest that considerations relating to discovery\nare irrelevant to the justificatory enterprise, and I am not\ndisputing this. Whether the solution to a scientific problem\nwere discovered in a laboratory or revealed by the Oracle of\nDelphiwouldhavenobearingonitsjustification.WhatIam\nclaiming is that criteria of justification play a role in discov-\nery.IamdisputingPopper\u2019sclaimthatdiscoveryisirrational.\nGivenwhatweknowabouttheworldandabouttheprac-\nticeofscience,theDelphicOracletheoryofdiscoveryisnota\nplausible one. Discoveries donotsuddenlyspring forth fully\nformed absent of context. Rather, scientific discoveries arise\nin the context of ongoing scientific investigation. A scien-\ntist is always in media res, working on particular problems\nwithin a rich problem context that includes previous theo-\nries, experimental results, techniques of analysis, and stan-\ndards for judging the worth of scientific contributions\n(Schaffner 1980, p.198). These are the source of both ideas\nand constraints. In the course of this activity, problems\nevolveandarerefinedandnewproblemsemerge.AsNickles\nso aptly put it (pace Samuel Butler): \u201cA theory is but a prob-\nlem\u2019s way of generating new problems\u201d (Nickels 1980, p.53).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 359 And the context is the source of constraints on the possi-\nbilities for solution. Nickels again:\nthe constraints constitute a rich supply of premises and con-\ntext-specificrulesforreasoningtowardaproblemsolutionand\npermit us to explain the fact that scientists do reason to solu-\ntions (p.37).\nThese arguments suggest a process of discovery not as a\nsingle moment of inspiration, but rather as a gradual, ongo-\ningprocessinwhichinsightandjustificationareinterwoven.\nHattiangadi (1980) argues, in fact, that it is impossible to\nclearly distinguish pure contexts of discovery since any idea\nthat might be considered in the context of discovery with\nrespect to one theory will itself be a part of the context of\njustification of a previous theory out of which it developed.\nFinocchiaro (1980) makes the same point with respect to\nGalileo\u2019sDialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems:\nsupposethatthewholeDialogueiscategorizedasanattemptto\nprove Copernicanism, and hence placed in the context of jus-\ntification; in the course of such an attempted proof one may\nfindhimselfformulatingtheprincipleofmechanicalrelativity,\norofconservationofmotion.Thenthesamebookconstitutes\ncontextofdiscoveryfromthepointofviewofthoseprinciples\n(pp.94-95).\nI am not here arguing for a logic of discovery in the sense\nof an algorithm for making discoveries. I am, rather arguing\nfor the rationality of discovery. I would agree with Nickels\n(1980,p.40)that\u201cdiscoverynormallyisareasoned,judgmen-\ntal process (too rich to be informatively captured by a con-\ntent-neutral logic).\u201d\n4.2.2. Criticism as Generative\nWe have seen the problems with the idea that the genera-\ntionofnovelideasisnon-critical.Ibelievethattherearealso\nproblems with the complementary idea, namely that criti-\n360MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN cismlacksagenerativecomponent.Thisideaisbasedonthe\nassumption that the activity of criticism is strictly analytic,\nselectiveandrule-determined.Giventhenecessaryinforma-\ntionfromwithintherelevantframeworkandtheappropriate\nreasoningtechniques,theprocessofarrivingatajudgmentis\nlargely algorithmic.\nA closer examination of the process of criticism would\nsuggest, however, that critical evaluation is not algorithmic\nbut has a generative, imaginative component.3 The applica-\ntion of evaluative criteria is seldom automatic but involves\ntheinterpretationofthesituationandimaginativejudgment\nregarding their applicability and satisfaction. Overall assess-\nment in any complex circumstance requires the considera-\ntionofalternativesandultimatelytheconstructionofaposi-\ntion based on the weighing, reconciling and integrating of a\nvariety of points of view.\nLet us take, as an example, the species of argument criti-\ncismthatisthedomainofinformallogic.Duetoitsancestry\nin formal deductive logic, the domain of informal logic may\nappear aclosedsysteminvolvingalgorithmic proceduresfor\nthe correct assessment of arguments. This seems, in fact, to\nbe the picture of argument that underlies Rorty\u2019s view. Such\namodelbecomesinappropriate,however,whendealingwith\nreal arguments in natural language. In the latter case, argu-\nment criticism, although constrained by rules, is not deter-\nmined by rules but is a constructive enterprise (Bailin 1990).\nCriticism involves, first, the interpretation of arguments,\nbutthisisnotastraightforwardandsimpleprocess.Wecon-\nstruct an interpretation guided by textual information but\ntextsarealwaysandnecessarilyincomplete,andattimessev-\neral plausible inferences can be made depending on back-\nground knowledge and assumptions. This incompleteness\nalsomeansthatthereceiverhasaroletoplayinconstructing\n3.For an elaboration of this argument regarding the generative dimension of criticism, see\nBailin 1990.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 361 meaning,leavingopenthepossibilityofdifferingequallyjus-\ntified interpretations.\nSupplyingthemissing premises andunstatedassumptions\nofanargumentalsoinvolvesimaginativeconstructiononthe\npart of the evaluator. The fact that considerable debate exits\nover how to fill in missing premises suggests that it may not\nbe possible to formalize a method for doing so. The con-\nstructivedimensionbecomesevenmoresalientinthecaseof\nfindingunstatedassumptions.AsScriven(1976)hasdemon-\nstrated,findingtheilluminatingassumptionsofanargument\nas opposed to the obvious unhelpful ones requires \u201ca sub-\nstantialsliceoforiginalthinking\u201d(p.169).Contextandback-\nground knowledge as well as informal logical principles are\nrequired in order to reconstruct an argument.\nTheprocessofargumentevaluationalsodisplaysacreative\ndimension.Mostnaturallanguageargumentsarenotstrictly\ndeductive but rather contain types of reasoning which leave\nsome play between the premises and conclusions. As Blair\nand Johnson (1987) point out, arguments may contain rea-\nsoning in which:\ntheconclusionfollows,ceterisparibus,oronbalance,orinsome\notherqualifiedwaywhichsuggestsamoretenuousrelationship\nbetweenpremisesandconclusionsthanwouldbethecasewith\neither deductive or inductive reasoning (p.43).\nAs a consequence, the procedure for the assessing of argu-\nments cannot be formalized. There is room for differences of\nview with respect to the evaluation of particular arguments.\nThis indeterminacy can be seen in that aspect of argument\nevaluation dealing with the identification of fallacies and is\napparentwithrespecttoallthreetypesoffallacies:fallaciesof\nrelevance, of sufficiency and of acceptability. There may, for\nexample, be legitimate debate as to the relevance of certain\nconsiderations toanargument andajudgment regarding rel-\nevance may depend on what unstated assumptions are sup-\n362MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN posed.AccordingtoJohnsonandBlair(1983,p.39),\u201crelevance\nis always a judgment call, and there is no reason to think that\nany algorithmic procedure will come along to change that.\u201d\nThesituationissimilarwithrespecttofallaciesofsufficiency.\nAlthoughthereareprinciplesthatguidetheassessmentofsuf-\nficiency,thereisnoalgorithmfordetermininghowmuchevi-\ndence is sufficient. And again with respect to acceptability,\nJohnson and Blair (1983) tell us that judgments of acceptabil-\nity are dialectical and must be determined with an imagined\naudience in mind and in light of purposes.\nEvaluating arguments by analogy also requires a contribu-\ntion on the part of the assessor. Determining the appropri-\nateness of an analogy involves imagining the similarities and\ndifferences between the cases and may require considerable\nimaginative reconstruction and the supplying of context.\nInventingacounter-exampletotestthestrengthofanargu-\nment is clearly a creative act, as is the consideration of alter-\nnativearguments.AsScriven(1976,p.36)soeloquentlystates:\nTheprocessoftryingtothinkofalternativeexplanationsofaset\noffacts\u2026isanentirelycreativeprocess.Itisexactlytheprocess\nwhich the great original scientist goes through in coming up\nwith a novel theory. There are no precise rules to guide one in\nsuchasearch,anditrequiresimaginationnurturedbyarichand\nvaried experience togenerate the novel hypothesis here. Sothe\nveryprocessofcriticismnecessarilyinvolvesthecreativeactiv-\nity of generating new theories or hypotheses to explain phe-\nnomena that have seemed to other people to admit of only one\nexplanation.\nAn aspect of argumentation which falls within the domain\nof informal logic but which seems to be ignored by Rorty\u2019s\nexclusion of argument from innovation is the construction\nof arguments. The activity of argumentation does not consist\nsolely in interpreting and evaluating already existing argu-\nments. It also consists in coming up with arguments. And\ncoming up with new arguments is a creative activity, con-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 363 sisting in the recognition of problems or alternatives and the\nconstructionofacoherentchainofreasoning.Suchconstruc-\ntion must, however, conform to all the critical standards that\nguide evaluation. Moreover, the constructor must recognize\nany logical vulnerabilities in the argument. The constructor\nis, then, simultaneously a critic. The critic makes an imagina-\ntive contribution to the assessment in all the ways previously\ndescribed and must be able to construct a cogent argument\nto support the critique. The critic is, then, simultaneously a\nconstructor. Argument construction and critique are, thus,\ninseparable and intertwined aspects of the same process, the\nprocess of argumentation.\nIn considering the role of argument in conceptual change,\nit is important to focus on the whole process of argumen-\ntation and not just on the assessment of isolated arguments.\nArgumentation is a dialectical process that involves the con-\nstructionaswellastheevaluationofparticularargumentsbut\nalso, ultimately, of entire beliefs sets or views. In the process\nof argumentation, claims are proposed along with their jus-\ntification, the claims and reasons are tested and challenged,\nthey may be rejected or reformulated, alternative arguments\nmay be proposed, these will be tested and perhaps reformu-\nlated, and in the end a view is arrived at which takes into\naccount the strengths and weaknesses of the various argu-\nments and synthesizes the strongest elements into a coherent\nwhole.Theviewthusarrivedatwillbeprovisionalasanypar-\nticular instance of argumentation is but one piece of a larger\nprocess of belief formation and testing (Blair and Johnson),\none moment in an ongoing disciplinary and social conversa-\ntion (Bailin 1992b).\n5. INQUIRY\nWhat I am offering, then, is an alternative picture of how\ninquiry proceeds to the one suggested by Rorty. For Rorty,\ninquiry seems to be constituted by two distinct and separate\n364MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN kinds of activities. On the one hand there is the analytic,\nlogical, bounded and conservative activity of argumentation\nor criticism, which works with existing concepts and allows\nfor the manipulation of elements within frameworks that\narestatic,singularandself-contained.Ontheotherhandwe\nhave the speculative, creative, progressive activity of strong\npoetry,whichtranscendsframeworksandcreatesnewideas,\nnew visions, and new vocabularies unconstrained by the\nstrictures of critical judgment and argumentation.\nWhat I propose is a picture of inquiry as a single activity\nconstituted by the dynamic interplay between generation\nand criticism. Engaging in our various traditions and prac-\ntices of inquiry always and simultaneously involves both. In\nattempting to solve problems posed by the tradition, both\ntheconstraintsoflogicandtheinventivenessofimagination\ncome into play. And in some cases, our reasoning will lead\nus to question assumptions, break rules and put elements\ntogetherinnewways\u2013thusissuinginideasthatmaydisplay\nconsiderable novelty.\nThis process of inquiry is instantiated in disciplines and\ntraditions of inquiry that are open-ended, dynamic, plural,\nand overlapping. There are live questions, ongoing debates\nandareasofcontroversywithineverydisciplinethatfurnish\nthearenaforevolutionandchange(Bailin1992a).Moreover\na central characteristic of rational inquiry is that \u201cit aims\nto discover its own weaknesses and rectify what is at fault\nwith its own procedures\u201d (Lipman 1991, p.121). Thus the\ncritical procedures of the traditions provide for the possi-\nbility of the evolution of the tradition itself in light of new\nevidence and arguments, problems and limitations discov-\neredinthecourseofinquiry,andcriticismsfromcompeting\nstrandsbothwithinthetraditionsandoutsideit.Thereisno\nneedtopositstrongpoetrytoaccountforconceptualchange.\nArgumentation, as instantiated in our traditions of inquiry,\ncan achieve that goal.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 365 I want to make clear that in making this argument, I am\ninnowaydenigrating theimportance ofpoetry.Ihavegreat\nrespect for,indeed passion forpoetry and think that the arts\nhave a crucially important role to play in envisioning possi-\nble futures. They can, as Greene (1995, p.112) tells us, move\nus into spaces where \u201cwe can create visions of other ways of\nbeingandponderwhatitmightsignifytorealizethem.\u201dThey\ncanshowus\u201cinrichdetail,asformalabstractargumentcan-\nnot, what it is like to live a certain way\u201d (Nussbaum 1990,\npp.227-228). Thus they may conjure up evocative instantia-\ntionsofthoseutopianvisions,orequallypowerfulevocations\nof dystopian ones.\nThere are several points to be made here, however. Poetic\ncreations, like innovative works in other domains, are not\ndiscontinuouswiththetraditionsoutofwhichtheydevelop.\nThey have their roots in previous artistic traditions, meth-\nods, and problems; reveal influences from other artists; and\nemploy critical analysis of aspects of society and culture.\nInsofar as such poetic visions are effective, insofar as they\ntouch us and capture our imagination, considerable critical\njudgment(aswellasimagination)wouldhavegoneintotheir\ncreation. Second, this poetic activity does not obviate the\nnecessity for critical evaluation of the ideas or visions thus\ncreated.Iseepoetry,then,asacomplementtoandnotasub-\nstitute for argument.\n6. CONCLUSION\nItistimenowtoreturntothequestionthatpromptedthis\ninvestigation initially: is argument for conservatives?

INTRODUCTION\nMy intention today is to critically explore the implications\nto the critical thinking movement of the work by cognitive\npsychologists and behavioral economists, commonly known\nas the heuristics and bias research.\nBut first I wish to position the critical thinking movement\nin the long historical tradition of philosophy that has been\ndevoted to the development and spread of rationality. From\nSocratestoJohnDewey,from5thcenturyAthensto21stcen-\ntury Windsor, the promotion of rationality has been recog-\nnized as a core philosophical project.\nIt is a project not always adequately respected and appre-\nciated in contemporary professional philosophy. This is in\npart because critical thinking was seen as remedial, but in\nfactpromotingrationalityisacrosscurriculumchallengeand\nresponsibility. Despite this lack of disciplinary support, the\ncriticalthinkingmovementhasgrowntotheextentthatprac-\ntically everyone now wants students to learn to \u201cthink crit-\nically\u201d and many post-secondary institutions identify critical\nthinking as their key learning outcome.

But before we make use of this research we\nmust subject it to a critical evaluation.\n3.

But\nrationality and critical thinking include not only deciding\nwhat to believe but also what to do, as both Ennis and Siegel\nindicate.Criticalthinkingisnotlimitedtoappliedepistemol-\nogy as I and others have argued, but also includes applied\nrational decision making.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 373 While the critical thinking movement has failed, by and\nlarge, to address rational decision making, neo-classical eco-\nnomics has dominated the concept of rationality as it applies\ntodecision making andusedittopromoteanarrow-minded,\nindividualistic and self-interested view of rationality known\nasrationalchoicetheory.TheCriticalThinkingProjectmust\nrecovertheconceptofrationalityfromtheneo-classicalecon-\nomists.\nMany of the insights emerging from the heuristic and bias\nliterature are of great use to the Critical Thinking Project.\nHowever, the research on decision making biases is under-\nminedbyuseofthenormsofrationalityembeddedinrational\nchoice theory. I will focus here on the heuristics and biases\nresearch on decision making rationality both because it has\nreceived less attention than the research on epistemic biases,\nand more importantly, because this model, which describes\nrationality as the efficient pursuit of individual self-interest,\nlegitimates an ideological position as if that were rationality\nitself.\nLet me start with the concept of bias.\n4.

The norms also\ninclude the laws of probability theory and norms used in\nrational choice theory (particularly expected utility). The\nnorms of probability are not contentious, but as indicated,\nthe norms that assume that people should make decisions in\naccordwithexpectedutilitytheoryi.e.,inlinewiththeirlong\nterm self-interest, are contentious.\n5. TVERSKY AND KAHNEMAN\nTwo Israeli psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kah-\nneman, did much of the initial research, and created the\nheuristics and bias nomenclature for this enterprise. Tversky\nandKahnemansetouttodemonstratethedescriptiveinaccu-\nracies of the model of human behavior built into neo-classic\neconomics.\nAs Kahneman recollects:\nOne day in the early 1970s, Amos handed me a mimeographed\nessaybyaSwisseconomistnamedBrunoFrey,whichdiscussed\nthe psychological assumptions of economic theory. I vividly\nremember the color of the cover: dark red. Bruno Frey barely\nrecalls writing the piece, but I can still recite its first sentence:\n\u201cTheagentofeconomictheoryisrational,selfish,andhistastes\ndo not change\u201d (Kahneman 2011).\nTverskyandKahnemancreatedaseriesofingeniousexper-\nimentswhichdemonstratedthedescriptiveinaccuracyofthe\nrational economic agent used in the neo-classical mathemat-\nical models of the economy. Their research did not call into\nquestion the notion that selfishness was the sole motivation\nof human behavior, but their research did call into question\nthe extent to which people reasoned in accord with model of\nrationality used by economists. In the process, they spawned\nthe vast heuristics and bias research. Their work led to the\ndevelopmentofanowwidelyacceptedmodelofhumanjudg-\nment known as the dual process model. The model, as sug-\ngestedbythetitleofDanielKahneman\u2019sbest-sellingreviewof\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 375 thisliterature,Thinking,FastandSlow(Kahneman2011),states\nthatwehavetwomodesofjudgment:analgorithmic/intuitive\nmode that is quick and a slower more reflective mode\u2014the\nlatter the kind of thinking encouraged in critical thinking\ncourses.\nThe dominant \u201cfast process\u201d usually serves us well enough\nandapparentlyservedourantecedentswellenoughtobecome\ngenetically embedded in our thinking processes. Of course,\nnot all fast and intuitive processes are \u201cnatural.\u201d When we\nlearn to drive a car, we acquire all sorts of quick intuitive\nprocesses necessary for effective driving\u2014assessing speed,\nappropriate following distance etc. Experts also often learn\nquick intuitive responses that are reliable, e.g., chess masters.\nBut on some occasions and in reference especially to proba-\nbilistic reasoning, this fast intuitive process tends to lead to\nerroneous or biased judgments. These biases have been iden-\ntified in a wide range of experiments by cognitive psycholo-\ngists.\n6. THE GREAT RATIONALITY DEBATE\nAs many of you probably know, there were considerable\nnegative reaction to the early work of Tversky and Kahne-\nman,especiallytotheinferencethattheirstudiesshowedthat\npeoplewereirrationalintheirprobabilisticjudgments.There\nwerebasicallytwoarguments: 1.thatsubjectsmisunderstood\nthe questions about likelihood and therefore their judgments\nwere reasonable given their understanding of the questions,\nand2.thatthewaythatpeoplereasonedmustbydefinitionbe\nrational so that their answers did not violate relevant norms\nof rationality. Without going into all the replies, both objec-\ntions were credibly addressed by the fact that subjects, once\nthey were shown the relevant calculus, understood why their\nresponses were incorrect. In addition, people who were sta-\ntistically sophisticated and understood the normatively cor-\nrect answers still felt the pull of their intuitive answers while\n376MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN conceding that the intuitive judgment was incorrect. Similar\nobjections can arise in relation to people\u2019s deviations from\nthe norms of rational choice theory but, as I will show, those\nobjections are more cogent (Stanovich 2011).\n7. EPISTEMIC BIASES\nI shall turn first to the research on epistemicbiases. There\nare two excellent introductions to this material: the best-sell-\ning Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (2011) and a\nmoreacademicandcomprehensivetext,ThinkingandDeciding\nby John Baron (2000).\nMany of the classic experiments are no doubt known to\nmostofyou.Butletmequicklyreviewthemostfamousinitial\nresultswhicharealsoquiterelevanttocriticalthinking.Basi-\ncally we tend to intuitively judge the likelihood of an event\nbased on a number of factors:\nRepresentativeness: An event that looks like a stereotype is\njudged to be more likely.\nAvailability:Iftheeventiseasytoimagine,itisjudgedtobe\nmorelikely.Thiseaseofimaginingcanbeafunctionofremem-\nberingithappeningorrememberinghearingaboutit(thepower\nofthemedia),orbecauseadescriptionofitshappeningisplau-\nsible (a good story) and easy to imagine.\nVividness:Iftheeventisemotionallypowerful,itisjudgedto\nbe more likely.\nTversky and Kahneman demonstrated that these psycho-\nlogicalfactorsleadtotheviolationofabasicandquitesimple\nprincipleofprobability,theprincipleofconjunctiveprobabil-\nity: the conjunct of two events is never more probable than\neither of the events.\nThis tendency is not just common to the statistically naive.\nFor example, when the following problem of choosing which\noftwoeventswasmorelikelywasgiventograduatestudents,\na majority of them committed the classic fallacy of rating the\nmore complex (but easily imagined) event as more likely.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 377 1.

An earthquake in California sometime next year, causing a flood\nin which more than 1,000 people drown (Kahneman 2011,\np.131).\nChoosing 2 over 1 involves violating the conjunctive rule of\nprobability.

INSTRUMENTAL RATIONALITY: RATIONAL CHOICE\nTHEORY AND BIASES\nThe norms of rational choice theory, the mathematically\neleganttheorydevelopedintheearly1950s,providesthethe-\noretic base for most neo-classical economic models. The the-\nory assumes that humans fit (and ought to fit) the model of\n\u201chomoeconomicus\u201dor\u201cecons\u201dastheyarecalledinthebehav-\nioral economics literature. For econs, all decisions are self-\ninterested, well informed, based on unchanging tastes, and in\nconformitywithexpectedutilitytheory\u2014themodelthathor-\nrified Kahneman when he first read of it. Unfortunately, it\nis these norms that provide the basis for identifying decision\nmaking errors and biases.\nWhile economists admit that rational choice theory is an\nidealization of actual behavior, they have argued that it is no\nworse an idealization than Newton\u2019s frictionless plane and\nis equally theoretically useful. Starting in the late 1970s, the\nclaim that rational choice theory was an appropriate way to\nbuildasupposedlyempiricaleconomictheorywascalledinto\nquestion not only by the research of Tversky and Kahneman\nbut also by the emerging field of behavioural economics.\nThe crash of 2008 may well have been the coup de gras to the\nviewthatrealworldfinancialactorssuchasbankersactratio-\nnally.Butitisimportantforourpurposestounderstandthat,\nwhile behavioral economists have demonstrated the descrip-\ntive inaccuracy of the assumption that humans are \u201cecons,\u201d\nthey still accept the associated norms of rationality. As a\nresult,thebiasesidentifiedintheheuristicsandbiasliterature\nas decision making irrationalities presume that the descrip-\ntionofhumansaseconsisthenormativelycorrectdescription\nof the \u201crational person.\u201d\n380MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN The critiques of econs as appropriate models of human\nbeings and rational choice theory as an appropriate descrip-\ntive model of human behavior are long standing. Indeed, the\nidea that all actions are motivated by self-interest was effec-\ntively critiqued by Bishop Butler in 18th century. Behavioral\neconomists argue that this view of human nature is factually\nincorrect, but generally fail to criticize the associated\nnorms\u2013their goal is to identify the descriptive inaccuracy of\nrational choice theory not criticize its norms.\nFor example, the entertaining and insightful behavioral\neconomist, Dan Ariely, states in the introduction to his book,\nThe Upside of Irrationality:\n. . . there is a flip side to irrationality, one that is actually quite\npositive. Sometimes we are fortunate in our irrational ability\nbecause,amongotherthings,theyallowustoadapttonewenvi-\nronments,totrustotherpeople,toenjoyexpendingeffortandto\nlove our kids (Ariely 2010, p.12).\nHow very odd that the abilities described by Ariely should\nbe characterized as irrational. But not odd if you realize the\ndefinition of rationality that he is using. As he says: \u201cFrom\na rational perspective, we should make only decisions that\nare in our best interest (\u201cshould\u201d is the operative word\nhere)\u201d(Ariely 2010, p.5 ).\nKahneman is sensitive to this criticism. He states:\nI often cringe when my work with Amos is credited with\ndemonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in fact\nourresearchonlyshowedthatHumansarenotwelldescribedby\nthe rational-agent model (Kahneman 2011, p.333).\nButascanbeseenfromthisquotation,hedoesnotgoasfar\nastosaythatthenormsoftherational-agentmodelarefaulty.\nBeforedealingwiththeobviousmoralfailuresofthe\u201cecon\u201d\nnorms of rational behavior, I wish to look at some of the\ntendencies (so-called biases) identified in the behavioral eco-\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 381 nomic literature that are supposed examples of common\nhuman irrationality.\nThe norms of rational choice are purely \u201cproduct\u201d norms.\nThey provide criteria for assessing a decision, but not for\nassessing the decision making process. This is different from\nmany of the norms of rationality used to identify epistemic\nbiases which reference procedural norms e.g., confirmation\nbias.Thisfocusplacessignificantlimitationsontheusefulness\nofrationalchoicetheoryasaguideforrationaldecisionmak-\ning. But first the theory.\nThefundamentalprincipleofrationalchoicetheoryisthat,\nto be rational, people must be consistent in their preferences.\nIf they prefer A over B and B over C, then they should prefer\nA over C and should do so over time and in all situations.\nThe principle sounds reasonable enough but its emphasis on\nunchanging preferences turns out to have significant and\ndubiousimplicationsbecauseitrequiresourdecisionmaking\nto be indifferent to context. The other key aspect of rational\nchoice theory is the theory of expected utility\u2014a theory\nbased on the notion of a good bet.\n9. EXPECTED UTILITY THEORY\nWhile expected utility theory is, in principle, applicable to\nanyoutcome,mostofthediscussionfocusesonfinancialgam-\nbles.Agoodgambleisonewhichifplayedinthelongrunwill\nresultinyourbeingaheadofthegame,i.e.,winningmorethan\nlosing. The best gamble is the option that will yield the most\nfinancialreturninthelongrun.Inmoremathematicalterms:\nthe expected utility of a gamble is equal to the probability of\nthe outcome multiplied by the amount of the outcome minus\nany cost of the gamble.\nThere are a number of obvious practical difficulties in act-\ning in accord with rational choice theory. One obvious diffi-\nculty is that we are often confronted with decisions without\nknowing the probability of the various outcomes. The next\n382MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN obviousproblemisthattheutilityofanoutcomeissubjective.\nThis has led theorist to redefine outcomes in terms of pref-\nerences rather than utility. As a result, economists generally\ntalkaboutpreferencemaximizingnotutilitymaximizing.But\nsincetheymainlytalkaboutmoney,theyassumethatindivid-\nualpreferenceswillbetoattainthemaximumfinancialbene-\nfit.\nBut even when people know the probabilities and payoffs\ninvolved, there are many situations in which most people do\nnotadheretothenormofexpectedutility\u2014andquitereason-\nablyso.Forexample,inmostsituationsthemajorityofpeople\nprefer an outcome that is certain rather than an iffy bet even\nif the iffy bet would provide a greater payoff in the long run.\n10. CERTAINTY BIAS \u2014 OR A REASONABLE PREFERENCE?\nTversky and Kahneman used the following question as one\nof the ways to illicit the certainty effect.\nWhich of the following options do you prefer?\nA. a sure gain of $30\nB. 80% chance to win $45 and 20% chance to win nothing\nIn this case, 78% of participants chose option A while only\n22% chose option B (value $36). This illustrates most people\u2019s\ntendency to favour the more certain bet over the less certain\nbet despite it greater \u201cexpected utility\u201d (the expected value of B\nexceeds that of A by 20%) (Kahneman 2011, pp.364-365).\nThe fact that that people violate the norms of expected\nutility theory does not, of course, prove them irrational. For\nexample,considerthepurchaseofinsurancewhich,intheory,\nviolates expected utility theory.\n11. LOSS AVERSION: CONTEXT COUNTS\nEven before the work of Tversky and Kahneman, it was\nnotedthatpeoplefavouredcertaintyoverthepromiseoflong\nterm gain. It was thought that this was because people were\nrisk averse. This analysis of people\u2019s decision making was\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 383 derivedinlargepartfromtheworkofDanielBernoulli(1738)\nwho devised a model of risk aversion which used the declin-\ning utility of the dollar to also explain apparent deviations\nfrom choosing the \u201cbest bet.\u201d\nBut Tversky and Kahneman noted that people were influ-\nencedintheirassessmentoftheutilityofafinancialoutcome\nby considerations other than their current state of wealth.\nTversky and Kahneman\u2019s research showed people tended to\nbelossaversenotriskaverse.Lossaversionhastwoimplica-\ntions:\n1. People are only tempted by a bet in which the gain is much\ngreater than the possible loss.\n2. Ifapersonseestheirsituationasaloss,e.g.,havealreadylost\na bet or suffered financial reversal, they are now willing to\ntakeagreaterrisktoreturntoa\u201cnolosssituation\u201dthanthey\nwould if they were not already in a loss situation.\nFor example, consider the following problems:\nProblem 1: Which do you choose?\n(a) Get $900 for sure OR (b) 90% chance to get $1,000\nProblem 2: Which do you choose?\n(a)Lose$900forsureOR(b)90%chancetolose$1,000\nIf you are like most people, you will chose (a) in the first\nproblem but (b) in the second. This tendency can lead to all\nsorts of risky efforts to make up for losses widely seen, for\nexampleincompulsivegamblers,butalsostockbrokers(Kah-\nneman 2011, p.224).\nThe inclinations to accept or reject a gamble are mostly\nintuitive system 1 choices. And they clearly do not accord\nwith the norm of expected utility theory which would ignore\nthe framing of the gamble as loss or gain, i.e., ignore the con-\ntext in which a decision is being made.\nAs mentioned, rational choice theory treats context (e.g.,\nhistory, financial situation, social situation, cultural context)\nasirrelevant.Decisionsthattakethesetypesofconsiderations\n384MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN intoaccountandresultinchangingpreferenceswillbejudged\nas inconsistent and \u201cbiased\u201d by the theory.\n12. PERCENTAGE FRAMING\nTversky and Kahneman have also shown other ways that\ncontexts influence our decision making. For example:\nImagine that you are about to purchase a calculator for $15.\nAnothercustomertellsyouthatthecalculatoryouwishtobuyis\nonsalefor$10atanotherstore,located20minutes\u2019driveaway.\nWould you make a trip to the other store?\nIncontrast,imaginethistimethatyouarebuyingajacketfor\n$125andyoulearnthatyoucansave$5dollarsonthejacketby\ndrivingtoanotherstore.Wouldyoudrive20minutestosavethe\n$5?\nInonetypicalexperiment,68%oftherespondentswerewilling\nto drive to the other branch to save $5 on a $15 calculator, but\nonly 29% of respondents were willing to make the same trip to\nsave $5 on a $125 jacket (Kahneman 2011, p.367).\nIrrational? From the economists\u2019 point of view, 5 dollars is\n5 dollars and the context (or frame) of the purchase is irrele-\nvant. But not to most humans. Can our tendency to assess a\nsavinginlightofthecontextleadtoirrationality?Yes,butisit\nfundamentally irrational?\u2014only if you are an econ.\n13. MENTAL ACCOUNTING: BUDGET CATEGORIES\n1. Imagine that you have decided to see a play and paid the\nadmission price of $50 per ticket. As you enter the theater,\nyou discover that you have lost the ticket. The seat was not\nmarked, and the ticket cannot be recovered. Would you pay\n$50 for another ticket? (Yes 46%); No 54%)\n2. In the alternative, imagine that you have decided to see a\nplay where admission is $50 per ticket. As you enter the\ntheater, you discover that you have lost a $50 bill. Would\nyou still pay $50 for a ticket for the play? (Yes 88%); No\n12%) (Kahneman 2011, p.368).\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 385 Why are so many people unwilling to spend $50 after having\nlost a ticket, if they would readily spend that sum after losing\nan equivalent amount of cash? The difference is our mental\naccounting. The $50 for the ticket was spent from the play\n\u201caccount\u201d\u2014thatmoneyisalreadyspent;thelossofthecashisnot\npostedtotheplay\u201caccount\u201danditaffectsthepurchaseofaticket\nonly by making the individual feel slightly less affluent.\nAsKahnemanadmits,whilethisframingviolatestheeconomic\nrationality principle that only the amount of money counts not\nthe context, most people do it.\nThe normative status of the effects of mental accounting is\nquestionable.Itcanbearguedthatthealternativeversionsofthe\ncalculatorandticketproblemsdifferalsoinsubstance.Inpartic-\nular, it may be more pleasurable to save $5 on a $15 purchase\nthan on a larger purchase, and it may be more annoying to pay\ntwiceforthesameticketthantolose$50incash.Regret,frustra-\ntion, and self-satisfaction can also be affected by framing (Kah-\nneman and Tversky 1982).\nSo the theory is saved by considerations such as \u201cIf such sec-\nondary consequences are considered legitimate, then the\nobserved preferences do not violate the criterion of invariance\nandcannotreadilyberuledoutasinconsistentorerroneous.\u201dAs\nlong as you posit subjective utilities as explanations (and these\nutilities can be \u201crationally\u201d influenced by frames), you can save\nthe normative theory. But why not just say that the theory is an\ninadequate account of the norms of rational decision making?\nForecons,allmoneyismoneyandthissortofmentalaccount-\ning incorrectly allows the influence of budget category framing.\nButforthoseofuswhotrytokeeponbudget,orforanybureau-\ncratic institution, budget categories serve a very important and\nrational purpose.\n14. ENDOWMENT EFFECT\nThe endowment effect is the tendency to value something\n386MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN we have more than we would pay to get it. Another example\nfrom Thaler:\nOne case came from Richard Rosett, the chairman of the eco-\nnomics department and a long time wine collector. He told me\nthat he had bottles in his cellar that he had purchased long ago\nfor $10 that were now worth over $100. In fact, a local wine\nmerchant named Woody was willing to buy some of Rosett\u2019s\nolderbottlesatcurrentprices.Rosettsaidheoccasionallydrank\none of those bottles on a special occasion, but would never\ndream of paying $100 to acquire one. He also did not sell any\nofhisbottlestoWoody.Thisisillogical.Ifheiswillingtodrink\na bottle that he could sell for $100, then drinking it has to be\nworthmorethan$100.Butthen,whywouldn\u2019thealsobewilling\ntobuysuchabottle?Infact,whydidherefusetobuyanybottle\nthatcostanythingcloseto$100?Asaneconomist,Rosettknew\nsuch behavior was not rational, but he couldn\u2019t help himself\n(Thaler 2015, p.17).\nWhile Rosett couldn\u2019t help himself, is it really irrational to\nvalue what you have more than what you would currently\npay? The emotionally and intellectually rational heuris-\ntic\u2014stick with (love?) what you have\u2013 seems an eminently\nsane inclination and supportive of happiness. Irrational?\n15. SUMMARY\nThe model of rationality used by neo-classical economists\nhas a key limit which is the insistence on the irrelevance of\ncontext e.g., loss, commitment, ownership, frame, etc. While\nonlyabriefreviewoftheresearch,theseexamplessupportthe\nviewthatthe\u201cbiases\u201didentifiedintheresearchoninstrumen-\ntal rationality do not have the same status as those identified\nin the studies of epistemic biases. The results of the study of\ninstrumental rationality are best described as common ten-\ndencies not biases in the pejorative sense. It may well be that\nthese intuitions which \u201cviolate\u201d econ rationality contribute to\nour long run well-being.\nAn even more troubling implication of the rational choice\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 387 approach to decision making is the lack of consideration of\nmoral norms relevant to decision making, for example, fair-\nness.\n16. FAIRNESS: THE ULTIMATUM GAME\nToillustratethispoint,taketheinterestingeconomicexper-\nimental paradigm called the Ultimatum Game. In the Ulti-\nmatum Game, there is a sender and a receiver. The sender is\ngivensomemoney,typically$20andcanmakeanysplitofthe\nmoneywithareceiverwithwhomtheyhavenodirectcontact.\nThe sender decides how to split the money and then offers\na share to the receiver. If the receiver accepts the offer, they\nboth get the split money, but if the receiver rejects the offer,\nneither get the money.\nIf you are an econ, you take any offer\u2014a buck is buck, but\ncontrarytoeconomicthinking,mostreceiversrefuseoffersof\nanything less than about 40% because of the unfairness.\n17. THE SNOW SHOVEL PRICE\nHere is another example that illustrates people\u2019s concern\nwith fairness and rejection of supposedly rational economic\nbehavior. Markets obtain equilibrium between supply and\ndemand because people raise prices when demand goes\nup\u2014at least until new supplies arrive. This is the much\nextolledmethodbywhichafreemarketeconomyissupposed\nto stay in equilibrium between supply and demand. But con-\nsider this scenario:\nA hardware store has been selling snow shovels for $15. The\nmorning after a large snowstorm, the store raises the price to\n$20. Rate this action as: Completely fair, acceptable, somewhat\nunfair, or very unfair.\nWhen a couple of hundred Canadians were given this sce-\nnario, 18% judged it acceptable while 82% found this basic\neconomic strategy to be unfair. On the other hand, when the\n388MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN sameproblemwasputtoMBAs,76%judgeditacceptableand\nonly24%unfair.Itappearsthattakingeconomicscanhavethe\neffect of making you into a fairness-indifferent econ (Thaler\n2015, pp.127-128). It appears that instruction in economics\n(including the norms of rational choice theory) can have a\nsignificantly negative influence on people\u2019s moral sense (See\nFranket al1993).\n18. EVALUATIVE RATIONALITY\nThelackoffairnessasacriterionofrationaldecisionmak-\ning reflects a more general problem with the rational choice\napproach to decision making.

Evaluative rationality focuses not on how to efficiently\nrealize chosen ends but rather on the process for rational\nchoice of ends, involving not only a rational assessment of\none\u2019s self-interest but also relevant moral considerations.\nThere are two related issues here: rational choice of indi-\nvidual ends and rational choice of collective ends.

COLLECTIVE RATIONALITY AND CITIZENSHIP\nAmoreegregiousproblemwithrationalchoicetheoryisits\nlack of concern for the common good. Mapped onto collec-\ntivedecisionmaking,rationalchoicetheoryentailsacommit-\nment to seeing the common good as maximizing the aggre-\ngate satisfaction of individual (selfish) preferences. It is an\nessential part of the myth of the free market that \u201crational\u201d\necons pursuing their private interests will result in the best\npossible outcome for all.\nButasweareallaware,thepursuitofindividualpreferences\n(rational or not) can lead to collective defeat. Examples range\nfrom traffic jams to the collapse of the east coast fisheries to,\nmost troublingly, global climate change. Everyone prefers to\nutilize fossil fuels, and while no one intends to degrade the\nenvironment, the pursuit of individual preferences results in\nconditions that are harmful to everyone.\nThinking that the only consideration in rational decision\nmaking is your preferences implies that those concerned\nabout the environment are either irrational or simply that\nenvironmentalist just have different \u201cpreferences\u201d than those\nwhose preferences are self-interested.\n390MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN Thereisworkincognitivepsychologythataddresseseffec-\ntivedeliberativeprocesseswhichIwillbrieflyreview,butthat\nliteraturedoesnotaddressquestionsoffairness,intrinsicval-\nues, collective goods, etc. But there is a discipline that does:\nmoral and political philosophy. Recent philosophical work\nondeliberativedemocracytreatsdeliberationaboutthecom-\nmon good as the fundamental rational element of democracy\n(Elster 1998).\nI propose therefore that the study of evaluative rationality\nbe explicitly added to the corpus of rational reflection\naddressed by the Critical Thinking Project.\nWhile this is not the place to attempt to articulate the con-\ncept of applied rational decision making, it seems clear that\nit would differ from rational choice theory in rejecting max-\nimizing utility as the only norm and in being a truly usable\nguide to rational decision making. It would be a set of guide-\nlines to insure that the process of decision making took into\naccount all relevant considerations: factual, moral, political\nand personal.\n20. GROUP DECISION MAKING\nThereisresearchongroupdecisionmaking,butthenotion\nof collective or political rationality\u2014how we in fact make\nand how we should make decisions about the collective good\nis poorly developed. This is because the research tends to\nassume that the issue facing groups is either epistemological\nor only to identify the effective means to a given end, not to\ndeliberate about the choice of ends. For example, the studies\nof the decision making process of juries focus only on ques-\ntionsofepistemicnotevaluativerationality(whereasinactual\njury deliberations, concerns about the justice of the law may\ntrump factual concerns).\nCollective rationality also involves the norms of argumen-\ntation. The proper conduct of such discourse is crucial to\ncoming to a reasoned judgment about what to do or believe.\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 391 Tosomeextent,theissueofcollectiverationalityisaddressed\nin informal logic through the study of argumentation and\npragma-dialectics, but there is also work in psychology on\nthestudyofgroupdynamics.Againthereispsychologicaland\nsociological literature that is useful but needs to be critically\nevaluated. The Critical Thinking Project should address both\nthe norms of rational discourse and procedures for facilitat-\ning group rationality. Perhaps surprisingly, there is research\nwhich supports the notion that groups can often be more\nepistemologically rational when making decisions than indi-\nviduals. The reason for this is that group discussion can\ninvolve participants putting forward differing points of view.\nThe research on individual rationality underlines that the\nmost useful heuristic for rational evaluation is to consider\ncounter evidence and counter arguments. A properly con-\nstituted group should have people with alternative points of\nviewor,ifnecessary,havepeopleassignedasdevil\u2019sadvocates\nto make counter arguments and argue for alternative views\n(Lunenburg 2012).\nThe problems of confirmation bias, myside bias, even sunk\ncosts can often be addressed effectively in group discussion.\nIn addition, the research suggests that people make the best\ndecisions when they are required to justify them in the\nprocess, subjecting them not only to their own critical reflec-\ntion, but also to that of others. Presumably this is as true or\nperhaps truer for moral and political reflections.\nThereare,ofcourse,wellknownwaysinwhichgroupdeci-\nsion making can go awry\u2014e.g., the notorious problem of\n\u201cgroupthink.\u201d The research literature provides helpful infor-\nmation on how this can be avoided (Kerr and Tindale 2004;\nKerr, MacCoun and Kramer 1996).\nBased on the best research on collective decision making,\nThe Critical Thinking Project needs to develop and teach\npractical and inclusive guidelines for collective rational deci-\nsion making.\n392MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN 21. THE DIALECTICAL TIER: SOME POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS\nManyofthecriticismsofthenormsofeconomicrationality\nare long standing and widely accepted outside the discipline\nof economics, but one may question the appropriateness of\nintroducing concern for the common good or criticisms of\neconomics into the Critical Thinking Project. Conservative\ncritics of critical thinking already suspect it is a covert means\nfor teaching liberal ideology.\nI have two responses to this anticipated objection:\n1. Neo-classical economics and rational choice theory are\ncovert ways of introducing ideology under the guise of\nsimple logical principles and need to be countered. As\nThomas Piketty comments: \u201cTo put it bluntly, the discipline\nof economics has yet to get over its childish passion for\nmathematics and for purely theoretical andoften highly\nideological speculation\u201d\n2. The push from behavioural economics to revise the\nbehavioural assumptions of economics is an attempt to save\neconomics for its obsessive mathematical idealizations, but\nnot from normative ideology. To teach rationality we will\nneed principles of reasonable decision making and cannot\nrely on the econs\u2019 view because of its use in the heuristics\nand bias literature.\n\u201cThe ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when\ntheyarerightandwhentheyarewrongaremorepowerfulthan\niscommonlyunderstood.Indeed,theworldisruledbylittleelse.\nPractical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from\nany intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct\neconomist.\u201d (J.M. Keynes)\nINQUIRY:ANEWPARADIGMFORCRITICALTHINKING 393 Addressing rational decision making as it applies to evaluating\nends and to collective decision making requires a broader and\nless ideological approachtomaking rational decisions than pro-\nvided by rational choice theory norms.\nAnother objection to increasing the ambit of critical thinking\ntoincludeevaluativeandcollectivedecisionmakingisthatthese\nareas are highly controversial and do not lend themselves to\nCritical Thinking Project instruction the way that other norms\nof reasoning do. Rational choice theory ignores the decision\nmaking process, but critical thinking has always focused on\ndeliberative processes for assessing claims and the same\napproach is appropriate for decision making. In its simplest\nform, a check list of relevant considerations about ends and\nmeans when making a decision could go a long way to making\nmostpeople\u2019sdecisionmorerational.Inthesameway,decisions\nabout collective goals can be subject to widely accepted consid-\nerations, e.g., respect for minority rights, considerations of fair-\nness and justice, collective well-being, etc.\n22. THE CRITICAL THINKING PROJECT\nThe inadequacy of the model of rationality used in economics\nand now widely popularized in books about human decision\nmakingrequiresthatthoseconcernedaboutrationalityandcrit-\nicalthinkingexpandtheireffortsandpromoteacorrectiveview\nof rationality.\nIpropose,therefore,thatthoseincriticalthinking adoptwhat\nI have called the Critical Thinking Project, to improve people\u2019s\nreasoning by:\n1. Expanding the concept of critical thinking to include\nevaluative rationality and rational decision making in its\nmost inclusive sense.\n2. Developing an alternative model of rational decision\nmaking with usable guidelines for a rational decision\nmaking process.\n394MARKBATTERSBYANDSHARONBAILIN 3. Making critical use of research coming out of cognitive\npsychology and behavioral economics to help identify\ntendencies in human judgment that can lead to irrationality.\n4. Developing interdisciplinary research projects with\nresearchers who are concerned with the application of\nreason to judgment and decision making\u2014in particular\ncognitive psychologists, behavioural economists and\napplied decision theorist in business faculties.\n5. Teaching for evaluative rationality and rational decision\nmaking as well as argument evaluation, reasonable\ndiscourse and reasoned judgment.\nBeforeconcluding,letmereturntothepointImadeatthebegin-\nning. The increasing acceptance of critical thinking as a central\neducational concept positions those of us involved in critical\nthinking to significantly affect the intellectual landscape. The\nskepticismtowardseconomicscausedbythe2008crashhasalso\ncreated a more receptive public environment for critiques of\neconomics. The popular interest in the heuristics and bias liter-\nature also provides an opportunity to discuss and explore stan-\ndards of rationality.
