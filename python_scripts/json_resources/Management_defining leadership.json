It involves emotional ties and\ncommitments.\nKey Terms\nTransformational Leadership: A theory of leading that enhances the motivation, morale, and performance of followers through a variety\nof mechanisms.\nDefining Leadership\nLeadership is the process by which an individual mobilizes people and resources to achieve a goal. It requires both a set of skills that can\nbe learned as well as certain attributes that can be nurtured. Leaders inspire, challenge, and encourage others. They can persuade and\ninfluence, and they show resilience and persistence. All aspects of society have leaders. The concept of leader may call to mind a CEO, a\nprime minister, a general, a sports team captain, or a school principal; examples of leadership exist across a variety of organizations.\nLeaders motivate others to aspire to achieve and help them to do so. They focus on the big picture with a vision of what could be and\nhelp others to see that future and believe it is possible. In this way, leaders seek to bring about substantive changes in their teams,\norganizations, and societies.\nLeadership is a relationship between followers and those who inspire them and provide direction for their efforts and commitments. It\naffects how people think and feel about their work and how it contributes to a larger whole. Effective leaders can mean the difference\nbetween increasing a team's ability to perform or diminishing its performance, between keeping efforts on track or encountering disaster,\nand even between success or failure.\nLeadership and Management\nLeadership is one of the most important concepts in management, and many researchers have proposed theories and frameworks for\nunderstanding it. Some have distinguished among types of leadership such as charismatic, heroic, and transformational leadership. Other\nexperts discuss the distinctions between managers and leaders, while others address the personality and cognitive factors most likely to\npredict a successful leader. The many dimensions of leadership indicate how complex a notion it is and how difficult effective leadership\ncan be.\nAbraham Lincoln, 1860:\nAbraham Lincoln is considered\na model of leadership. He\nfought to preserve national\nunity amid the United States'\ngreatest trial, the Civil War,\nand successfully worked to\nend slavery.\nManagement versus Leadership\nThough they have traits in common, leadership and management both have unique responsibilities that do not necessarily overlap.\nLearning Objectives\nDistinguish between managerial roles and responsibilities and leadership roles and responsibilities\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nMany view leaders as those who direct the organization through vision and inspiration; managers are results-oriented and more focused\non task organization and efficiency.\nManagers sustain current systems and processes for accomplishing work, while leaders challenge the status quo and make change\nhappen.\nSuch distinctions may create a negative concept of managers. \"Leader\" brings to mind heroic figures rallying people together for a cause,\nwhile \"manager\" suggests less charismatic individuals focusing solely on efficiency.\nKey Terms\nmanagement: The act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and\neffectively.\nleadership: A process of social influence in which one person enlists the aid and support of others in accomplishing a common task.\nLeaders vs. Managers\nThe terms \" management \" and \" leadership \" have been used interchangeably, yet there are clear similarities and differences between\nthem. Both terms suggest directing the activities of others. In one definition, managers do so by focusing on the organization and\nperformance of tasks and by aiming at efficiency, while leaders engage others by inspiring a shared vision and effectiveness. Managerial\nwork tends to be more transactional, emphasizing processes, coordination, and motivation, while leadership has an emotional appeal, is\nbased on relationships with followers, and seeks to transform.\nOne traditional way of understanding differences between managers and leaders is that people manage things but lead other people.\nMore concretely, managers administrate and maintain the systems and processes by which work gets done. Their work includes planning,\norganizing, staffing, leading, directing, and controlling the activities of individuals, teams, or whole organizations for the purpose of\naccomplishing a goal. Basically, managers are results-oriented problem-solvers with responsibility for day-to-day functions who focus on\nthe immediate, shorter-term needs of an organization.\nIn contrast, leaders take the long-term view and have responsibility for where a team or organization is heading and what it achieves.\nThey challenge the status quo, make change happen, and work to develop the capabilities of people to contribute to achieving their\nshared goals. Additionally, leaders act as figureheads for their teams and organizations by representing their vision and values to\noutsiders. This definition of leadership may create a negative bias against managers as less noble or less important: \"Leader\" suggests a\nheroic figure, rallying people to unite under a common cause, while \"manager\" calls to mind less charismatic individuals who are focused\nsolely on getting things done.\nSources of Power\nPower is the ability to influence the behavior of others with or without resistance by using a variety of tactics to push or prompt action.\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify the six different sources of power available to organizational leaders and how leaders can employ these sources of power and\ninfluence in a meaningful and ethical way\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nPower is the ability to get things done, sometimes over the resistance of others.\nLeaders have a number of sources of power, including legitimate power, referent power, expert power, reward power, coercive power, and\ninformational power.\nAll of these sources of power can be used in combination, and people often have access to more than one of them.\nPower tactics fall along three dimensions: behavioral, rational, and structural.\nKey Terms\npower: The ability to influence the behavior of others, with or without resistance.\nUpward Power: When subordinates influence the decisions of the leader.\nDownward Power: When a superior influences subordinates.\nPower in Business\nPower is the ability to get things done. Those with power are able to influence the behavior of others to achieve some goal or objective.\nSometimes people resist attempts to make them do certain things, but an effective leader is able to overcome that resistance. Although\npeople sometimes regard power as evil or corrupt, power is a fact of organizational life and in itself is neither good nor bad. Leaders can\nuse power to benefit others or to constrain them, to serve the organization 's goals or to undermine them.\nAnother way to view power is as a resource that people use in relationships. When a leader influences subordinates, it is called downward\npower. We can also think of this as someone having power over someone else. On the other hand, subordinates can also exercise upward\npower by trying to influence the decisions of their leader. Indeed, leaders depend on their teams to get things done and in that way are\nsubject to the power of team members.\nThe Six Sources of Power\nPower comes from several sources, each of which has different effects on the targets of that power. Some derive from individual\ncharacteristics; others draw on aspects of an organization's structure. Six types of power are legitimate, referent, expert, reward, coercive,\nand informational.\nLegitimate Power\nAlso called \"positional power,\" this is the power individuals have from their role and status within an organization. Legitimate power\nusually involves formal authority delegated to the holder of the position.\nReferent Power\nReferent power comes from the ability of individuals to attract others and build their loyalty. It is based on the personality and\ninterpersonal skills of the power holder. A person may be admired because of a specific personal trait, such as charisma or likability, and\nthese positive feelings become the basis for interpersonal influence.\nExpert Power\nExpert power draws from a person's skills and knowledge and is especially potent when an organization has a high need for them.\nNarrower than most sources of power, the power of an expert typically applies only in the specific area of the person's expertise and\ncredibility.\nReward Power\nReward power comes from the ability to confer valued material rewards or create other positive incentives. It refers to the degree to which\nthe individual can provide external motivation to others through benefits or gifts. In an organization, this motivation may include\npromotions, increases in pay, or extra time off.\nCash reward: The ability to reward employees with\ncash and other incentives is a source of\norganizational power.\nCoercive Power\nCoercive power is the threat and application of sanctions and other negative consequences. These can include direct punishment or the\nwithholding of desired resources or rewards. Coercive power relies on fear to induce compliance.\nInformational Power\nInformational power comes from access to facts and knowledge that others find useful or valuable. That access can indicate relationships\nwith other power holders and convey status that creates a positive impression. Informational power offers advantages in building\ncredibility and rational persuasion. It may also serve as the basis for beneficial exchanges with others who seek that information.\nAll of these sources and uses of power can be combined to achieve a single aim, and individuals can often draw on more than one of\nthem. In fact, the more sources of power to which a person has access, the greater the individual's overall power and ability to get things\ndone.\nPower Tactics\nPeople use a variety of power tactics to push or prompt others into action. We can group these tactics into three categories: behavioral,\nrational, and structural.\nBehavioral tactics can be soft or hard. Soft tactics take advantage of the relationship between person and the target. These tactics are\nmore direct and interpersonal and can involve collaboration or other social interaction. Conversely, hard tactics are harsh, forceful, and\ndirect and rely on concrete outcomes. However, they are not necessarily more powerful than soft tactics. In many circumstances, fear of\nsocial exclusion can be a much stronger motivator than some kind of physical punishment.\nRational tactics of influence make use of reasoning, logic, and objective judgment, whereas nonrational tactics rely on emotionalism and\nsubjectivity. Examples of each include bargaining and persuasion (rational) and evasion and put downs (nonrational).\nStructural tactics exploit aspects of the relationship between individual roles and positions. Bilateral tactics, such as collaboration and\nnegotiation, involve reciprocity on the parts of both the person influencing and the target. Unilateral tactics, on the other hand, are\nenacted without any participation on the part of the target. These tactics include disengagement and fait accompli. Political approaches,\nsuch as playing two against one, take yet another approach to exert influence.\nPeople tend to vary in their use of power tactics, with different types of people opting for different tactics. For instance, interpersonally-\noriented people tend to use soft tactics, while extroverts employ a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts. Studies have shown\nthat men tend to use bilateral and direct tactics, whereas women tend to use unilateral and indirect tactics. People will also choose\ndifferent tactics based on the group situation and according to whom they are trying to influence. In the face of resistance, people are\nmore likely to shift from soft to hard tactics to achieve their aims.\nA Leader's Influence\nLeaders use social influence to maintain support and order with their subordinates.\nLearning Objectives\nDifferentiate between various methods of influencing others and their role in effective leadership\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nInfluence occurs when other people affect an individual's emotions, opinions, or behaviors. Leaders use influence to create the behaviors\nneeded to achieve their goal and vision.\nHarvard psychologist Herbert Kelman identified three broad varieties of social influence: compliance, identification, and internalization.\nCompliance is people behaving as others expect.\nIdentification happens when people are influenced by someone who is well-liked and respected, such as a celebrity.\nInternalization of values leads to those beliefs being reflected in behavior.\nKey Terms\nsocial influence: When an individual's emotions, opinions, or behaviors are affected by others.\nsocialization: The process of inheriting and disseminating norms and customs of behavior along with ideologies and other beliefs.\nThe Role of Influence in Leadership\nInfluence occurs when a person's emotions, opinions, or behaviors are affected by others. It is an important component of a leader's\nability to use power and maintain respect in an organization. Influence is apparent in the form of peer pressure, socialization, conformity,\nobedience, and persuasion. The ability to influence is an important asset for leaders, and it is also an important skill for those in sales,\nmarketing, politics, and law.\nIn 1958, Harvard psychologist Herbert Kelman identified three broad varieties of social influence: compliance, identification, and\ninternalization. Compliance involves people behaving the way others expect them to whether they agree with doing so or not. Obeying\nthe instructions of a crossing guard or an authority figure is an example of compliance. Identification is when people behave according to\nwhat they think is valued by those who are well-liked and respected, such as a celebrity. Status is a key aspect of identification: when\npeople purchase something highly coveted by many others, such as the latest smartphone, they are under the influence of identification.\nInternalization is when people accept, either explicitly or privately, a belief or set of values that leads to behavior that reflects those values.\nAn example is following the tenets of one's religion.\nPolitics as an Example of Social Influence: Leaders,\nsuch as politicians, often use identification to gain\nsupport for their beliefs on certain issues.\nHow Leaders Use Influence\nIn an organization, a leader can use these three types of influence to motivate people and achieve objectives. For example, compliance is\na means of maintaining order in the workplace, such as when employees are expected to follow the rules set by their supervisors.\nSimilarly, identification happens when people seek to imitate and follow the actions of people they look up to and respect, for example a\nmore experienced co-worker or trusted supervisor. Internalization results when employees embrace the vision and values of a leader and\ndevelop a commitment to fulfilling them.\nLeaders use these different types of influence to motivate the behaviors and actions needed to accomplish tasks and achieve goals.\nIndividuals differ in how susceptible they are to each type of influence. Some workers may care a great deal about what others think of\nthem and thus be more amenable to identifying the cues for how to behave. Other individuals may want to believe strongly in what they\ndo and so seek to internalize a set of values to guide them. In organizations and in most parts of life, sources of influence are all around\nus. As a result, our behavior can be shaped by how others communicate with us and how we see them.\nA Leader's Vision\nA clear and well-communicated vision is essential for a leader to gain support and for followers to understand a leader's goals.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain the relationship among vision, mission, and strategy as it pertains to leadership\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nVision is defined as a clear, distinctive, and specific view of the future that is usually connected with strategic decisions for the\norganization.\nA thriving organization will have a vision that is succinct, understandable, and indicative of the direction that the company wants to head\nin the future.\nLeaders are essential for communicating the vision of the organization and promoting the vision through the decisions they make and the\nstrategies they pursue.\nKey Terms\nvision: A clear, distinctive, and specific view of the future that is usually connected with a leader's strategic advances for the organization.\nA vision is defined as a clear, distinctive, and specific view of the future, and is usually connected with strategic advances for the\norganization. Effective leaders clearly define a vision and communicate it in such a way as to foster enthusiasm and commitment\nthroughout the organization. This ability to express a vision and use it to inspire others differentiates a leader from a manager.\nMany researchers believe that vision is an essential quality of effective leaders, as important as the abilities to communicate and to build\ntrust. Effective leaders clearly communicate their vision of the organization. Their decisions and strategies reflect their view of what an\nenterprise can be rather than what it currently is. A strong leader builds trust in the vision by acting in ways that are consistent with it and\nby demonstrating to others what it takes to make the vision a reality.\nVision is an essential component of an organization's success. A thriving organization will have a vision that is succinct, indicative of the\ndirection that the company is heading, and widely understood throughout all levels of the organization. The more employees are aware\nof, understand, and believe in the vision, the more useful it is in directing their behavior on a daily basis.\nVision connects\nto strategy: A\nconcise and clear\nvision is essential\nto drive and\ncommunicate an\norganization's\nstrategy.\nVision and mission are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is a useful distinction between the two. A vision describes an\norganization's direction, while its mission defines its purpose. By focusing on the value an organization creates, the mission helps\nprioritize activities and provides a framework for decision-making.\nVision also plays a significant role in a leader's strategy for the organization. By setting the direction, a vision underscores the necessity of\nall the areas of a business working toward the same goal. This unity of purpose often involves changing what is done and how, and\naligning the activities and behavior of people is critical to fulfilling a leader's vision. A vision reduces ambiguity and provides focus\u2014two\nbenefits that are especially valuable in turbulent or rapidly changing times.\nLeadership Traits\nTraits of effective leaders are conditionally dependent and have been debated for years, but researchers have identified some\ncommonalities.\nLearning Objectives\nSummarize the key characteristics and traits that are predictive of strong leadership capacity\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nEarly findings regarding trait theory show that relationships exist between leadership and individual traits such as intelligence, adjustment,\nextroversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and general self-efficacy.\nStephen Zaccaro, a researcher of trait theories, argues that effective leadership is derived from an integrated set of cognitive abilities,\nsocial capabilities, and dispositional tendencies, with each set of traits adding to the influence of the other.\nZaccaro's model points to extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism, honesty/integrity, charisma,\nintelligence, creativity, achievement motivation, need for power, oral/written communication, interpersonal skills, general problem-\nsolving, and decision making.\nKey Terms\nProximal: Located close to a reference point.\ndistal: Located far from a reference point.\nResearchers have debated the traits of a leader for many decades. Early trait theory proposed that merely a few personality traits have the\nability to determine the success of a leader. Researchers have since distanced themselves from this idea and theorized that the success of\na leader requires more than just a few essential traits. Researchers now attest that while trait theory may still apply, individuals can and do\nemerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks. Research findings show that significant relationships exist between leadership\nand a number of individual traits, among them intelligence, adjustment, extroversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and\ngeneral self-efficacy.\nOne prominent researcher in trait theory, Stephen Zaccaro, proposes a number of models that show the interplay of the environmental\nand personality characteristics that make a good leader. These models rests on two basic premises about leadership traits. First,\nleadership emerges from the combined influence of multiple traits, as opposed to coming from various independent traits. In other\nwords, Zaccaro argues that effective leadership is derived from an integrated set of cognitive abilities, social capabilities, and personal\ntendencies, with each set of traits adding to the influence of the other. The second premise suggests that leadership traits differ in their\nproximal (direct) influence on leadership. In this multistage model, certain distal or remote attributes (such as personal attributes,\ncognitive abilities, and motives/values) serve as precursors for the development of personal characteristics that more directly shape a\nleader.\nSome of the inherent leadership traits in Zaccaro's model include extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism,\nhonesty/integrity, charisma, intelligence, creativity, achievement motivation, need for power, oral/written communication, interpersonal\nskills, general problem-solving, decision making, technical knowledge, and management skills. Although these characteristics may\nresemble a laundry list of traits, Zaccaro and many other researchers have shown that they are all predictors of a successful leader.\nTrait leadership: Zaccaro's model (2004): This diagram shows one\ncontemporary theory of the essential traits of a leader. Zaccaro's theory\nemphasizes all of the attributes that make up the traits of a leader,\nincluding environmental, internal (personality), and cognitive abilities.\nLeadership Styles\nLeaders may adopt several styles according to what is most appropriate in a given situation.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain how different leadership styles may be adopted according to the demands of a given circumstance\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nThere are five primary leadership styles: engaging, authoritative, laissez-faire, participative, and transformational. All five styles can be\neffectively used in the appropriate circumstances.\nAn engaging style of leadership involves reaching out to employees and understanding their concerns and working situations.\nUnder the autocratic leadership style, all decision -making powers are centralized in the leader. Leaders do not entertain any suggestions\nor initiatives from subordinates.\nA person using a laissez-faire style of leadership does not provide direction, instead leaving the group to fend for itself. Subordinates are\ngiven a free hand in deciding their own policies and methods.\nA participative or democratic style of leadership involves the leader's sharing decision-making authority with group members while also\npromoting the interests of group members and practicing social equality.\nTransformational leadership motivates and inspires people to change their behaviors in service of a greater good.\nKey Terms\nlaissez-faire: French term literally meaning \"let [them] do,\"; it also broadly implies \"let it be,\" \"let them do as they will,\" or \"leave it alone.\"\nFinding the Right Style of Leadership\nA leader can take a number of different approaches to leading and managing an organization. A leader's style of providing direction,\nsetting strategy, and motivating people is the result of his or her personality, values, training, and experience. For example, a leader with a\nlaid-back personality may lead with a less formal style that encourages autonomy and creativity.\nEngaging Leadership\nEngaging styles of leadership involve reaching out to employees and understanding their concerns and working situations. Dr. Stephen L.\nCohen, the senior vice president for Right Management 's Leadership Development Center of Excellence, describes the engaging\nleadership style as communicating relevant information to employees and involving them in important decisions. This leadership style can\nhelp retain employees for the long term.\nEngaging leadership: The engaging style of\nleadership involves leaders reaching out to their\nconstituents and being involved in their\nsuccesses and struggles.\nAutocratic/Authoritarian Leadership\nUnder the autocratic leadership style, decision-making power is centralized in the leader. Leaders do not entertain any suggestions or\ninitiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management is effective for quick decision making but is generally not successful in fostering\nemployee engagement or maintaining worker satisfaction.\nLaissez-faire/Free-Rein Leadership\nA person may be in a leadership position without providing clear direction, leaving the group to choose its own path in achieving aims.\nSubordinates are given a free hand in deciding their own policies and methods. Laissez-faire is most effective when workers have the skills\nto work independently, are self-motivated, and will be held accountable for results.\nParticipative or Democratic Leadership\nA participative or democratic style of leadership involves the leader's sharing decision- making authority with group members. This\napproach values the perspectives and interests of individual group members while also contributing to team cohesion. Participative\nleadership can help employees feel more invested in decision outcomes and more committed to the choices because they have a say in\nthem.\nTransformational Leadership\nThe transformational leadership style emphasizes motivation and morale to inspire followers to change their behavior in service of a\ngreater good. The concept was initially introduced by James MacGregor Burns. According to Burns, transformational leadership is when\n\"leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\" Researcher Bernard M. Bass used Burns's\nideas to develop his own theory of transformational leadership. Bass clarified the definition to emphasize that transformational leadership\nis distinguished by the effect it has on followers.\nWhen to Use Different Styles\nDifferent situations call for particular leadership styles. Under intense time constraints, when there is little room to engage in long\ndiscussions that seek consensus, a more directive, top-down style may be appropriate. For a highly motivated and cohesive team with a\nhomogeneous level of expertise, a democratic leadership style may be more effective. Similarly, a participative leadership style may be\nmost appropriate for decisions that will require changes in behavior from a large group of people.\nEach style of leadership can be effective if matched with the needs of the situation and used by a skilled leader who can adopt a deft\napproach. The most effective leaders are adept at several styles and able to choose the one most likely to help the organization achieve\nits objectives.\nFour Theories of Leadership\nTheories of effective leadership include the trait, contingency, behavioral, and full-range theories.\nLearning Objectives\nDiscuss differing theories and approaches to defining and understanding leadership\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nModern trait theory proposes that individuals emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks; significant individual leadership\ntraits include intelligence, adjustment, extroversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and general self-efficacy.\nBehavioral theory suggests that leadership requires a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego; self-confidence is essential.\nContingency theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics, and no single optimal psychological profile of a\nleader exists.\nAccording to full-range theory of leadership, four qualities are essential for leaders: individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation,\ninspirational motivation, and idealized influence.\nKey Terms\nContingency: Likely to happen in connection with or as a consequence of something else.\nFor a number of years, researchers have examined leadership to discover how successful leaders are created. Experts have proposed\nseveral theories, including the trait, behavioral, contingency, and full-range models of leadership.\nThe Trait Theory of Leadership\nThe search for the characteristics or traits of effective leaders has been central to the study of leadership. Underlying this research is the\nassumption that leadership capabilities are rooted in characteristics possessed by individuals. Research in the field of trait theory has\nshown significant positive relationships between effective leadership and personality traits such as intelligence, extroversion,\nconscientiousness, self-efficacy, and openness to experience. These findings also show that individuals emerge as leaders across a variety\nof situations and tasks.\nThe Contingency Theory of Leadership\nStogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that persons\nwho are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. According to this approach, called contingency theory,\nno single psychological profile or set of enduring traits links directly to effective leadership. Instead, the interaction between those\nindividual traits and the prevailing conditions is what creates effective leadership. In other words, contingency theory proposes that\neffective leadership is contingent on factors independent of an individual leader. As such, the theory predicts that effective leaders are\nthose whose personal traits match the needs of the situation in which they find themselves. Fiedler's contingency model of leadership\nfocuses on the interaction of leadership style and the situation (later called situational control). He identified three relevant aspects of the\nsituation: the quality of the leader's relationships with others, how well structured their tasks were, and the leader's amount of formal\nauthority.\nThe Behavioral Theory of Leadership\nIn response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors. They evaluated what\nsuccessful leaders did, developed a taxonomy of actions, and identified broad patterns that indicated different leadership styles.\nBehavioral theory also incorporates B.F. Skinner's theory of behavior modification, which takes into account the effect of reward and\npunishment on changing behavior. An example of this theory in action is a manager or leader who motivates desired behavior by\nscolding employees who arrive late to meetings and showing appreciation when they are early or on time.\nB.F. Skinner: The father of\nbehavioral theory showed\nthe connection between\nbehaviors and reward and\npunishment. Today,\nmanagement often\nincorporates his findings.\nThe Full-Range Theory of Leadership\nThe full-range theory of leadership is a component of transformational leadership, which enhances motivation and morale by connecting\nthe employee's sense of identity to a project and the collective identity of the organization. The four major components of the theory,\nwhich cover the full range of essential qualities of a good leader, are:\nIndividualized consideration: the degree to which the leader attends to each follower's concerns and needs and acts as a mentor or coach\nIntellectual stimulation: the degree to which the leader challenges assumptions, takes risks, and solicits followers' ideas\nInspirational motivation: the degree to which the leader articulates a vision that is appealing and inspiring to followers\nIdealized influence: the degree to which the leader provides a role model for high ethical behavior, instills pride, and gains respect and\ntrust\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
